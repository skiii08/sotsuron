The Lobster," A beautiful dream with Colin Farrell's best screen role ever...
","It took some time to let Yorgos Lanthimos' new film 'The Lobster'  settle into my mind. On the surface is a dark comedy, full of rich  images, and staggering performances from its principal cast. Deeper  lays one of the most original and heart wrenching stories on modern  relationships, likely the best seen in film since Michel Gondry's  'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.'  'The Lobster' tells the story of a dystopian near future, where single  people, according to the laws of The City, are taken to The Hotel,  where they are obliged to find a romantic partner in forty- five days  or are transformed into beasts and sent off into The Woods. At the  center is David (played by Colin Farrell), who enters the Hotel with  his brother, who's been turned into a dog, and begins a domino effect  that will make him both an outcast and a fugitive.  Beginning with a hilarious and smart script by Lanthimos and co- writer  Efthymis Filippou, 'The Lobster' gets some of the year's biggest  laughs. The two create a symphony of truth about our society's  perception of relationships and love. When David first enters the  hotel, you can see the initial despair and fight against the system. He  believes in the idea of love but isn't particularly fond of being under  its spell once again. Its simply life and death but when the story  makes him an outcast, where love is forbidden, you see his hopeless  romantic self become drawn to his 'Short Sighted Woman.' (played by  Rachel Weisz) The evolution of David's outlook on his current situation  is authentic and real, as he shows the center of his heartache in only  intermittent spurts. You can thank all that to the powerhouse  performance by Colin Farrell, who delivers his best and most audacious  film role to date.  'The Lobster' isn't just about its script and lead performer. It also  assembles one of the year's best cast ensembles. Rachel Weisz is a  sensation, giving her best work since her Oscar-winning role in 'The  Constant Gardener.' As the 'Lisping Man,' its refreshing to see John C.  Reilly dig deep into a role like this, one of which we haven't seen  from him in nearly a decade. As the 'Limping Man,' Ben Whishaw  continues to build an arsenal of titanic-like performances, all of  which solidifies him as one of the best kept secrets working today.  More roles for him please. As the 'Loner Leader,' Léa Seydoux's  villainous and vile demeanor is a fantastical addition, adding a needed  depth and danger to the film and role. Olivia Colman's Hotel Manager is  a bonus treat, as she effortlessly brings chuckles and fear to her  mystery woman.  Cinematographer Thimios Bakatakis finds his stride and vision early on,  capturing an aesthetic that is both stylized and advantageous. The  visual contrast is dazzling and particularly noteworthy but what's  lurking between each and every frame is especially dynamic and robust.  One of the year's very best. Upon first viewing, Yorgos Mavropsaridis'  editing work can seem bloated but over 24 hours later, it's a taut and  vivaciously engaging piece, cut with a resemblance of Jeff Buchanan and  Eric Zumbrunnen's snubbed work on Spike Jonze's 'Her.' The score is  insanely haunting and very appropriate for its dark natured comic look  at life.  It took some time to digest but 'The Lobster' feels full of life and is  a soulful opus on love. Quirky and clever, its black comic tones  shouldn't distract from its core narrative and mission; to engage the  parimeters and infatuation of devotion. Just a dream.",10,162,316,27 September 2015
Moneyball," One of the great sports films of the millennium!
","Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill create one of the best on-screen chemistry between two actors this year in Bennett Miller's fabulous sophomore effort Moneyball. Delving into and bringing a fresh take on a sports film, Miller along with writers Steven Zaillian, Aaron Sorkin, and Stan Chervin achieve a well balanced story full of laughs, drama, and heart. Pitt brings one of his best interpretations of a character to life hosing in on the insecurities while bleeding out the confidence and sure-fire wit. Hill delivers his best performance of his career and one of the most surprisingly brilliant turns this year. He even manages to steal scenes from co-star Philip Seymour Hoffman, who is just as good as ever, and have the viewer hone in on his wonderful acting portrayal. Miller's direction should be applauded and recognized as going just as ferociously and heavyhearted into this film as he did with his directorial debut, Capote. This is the best baseball film to hit the screens since Field of Dreams.(***½)",8,3,4,27 November 2011
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," The franchise continues to grow...
","Are you anxiously awaiting the coming of the 'Mockingjay?'The YA (Young Adult) universe has been taking over cinema screens for years now. 'Twilight' dominated the box office for its run while 'Harry Potter' brought in more money than they knew what to do with. 'The Hunger Games' took on a new phase of the genre, appealing to not only the young people it so desperately needed for box office results, but keeping the older viewers/parents of these movie-goers interested. The next installment of the franchise, 'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1,' is a purely entertaining set piece for what will likely be a most intriguing finale.The obvious quarrel with the film is the splitting into two separate movies. 'Harry Potter' coined this tactic with 'The Deathly Hallows,' breaking them into two films to maximize box office potential. 'Twilight' soon followed with 'Breaking Dawn.' This installment is probably the least bloated out of any of the franchises seen yet. It feels legitimately focused on the development of the characters and the surroundings they are now inhabiting.Jennifer Lawrence reprises her role as Katniss from a whole new perspective. The film takes place just a short time after the events of 'Catching Fire.' Katniss is living in District 13, angry and in despair after losing Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) in Quarter Quell. To add, Gale (Liam Hemsworth) has revealed that District 12 has been destroyed. Only 950 of 10,000 survived the raid and Katniss is asked to be the face of the revolution that is now rising against the Capitol and President Snow (Donald Sutherland). When Peeta is revealed to be alive and being held in the Capitol, Katniss must wage war against Snow, with the rebels, and try desperately to save Peeta.Lawrence continues to develop Katniss and bring us on her journey with a believable and authentic nature. Katniss is very broken in this installment, weakened by the events that preceded her, and Lawrence executes it just about flawlessly. The real surprise, is how effective Hutcherson and Hemsworth are this time around. Their roles are expanded, and they are offered an opportunity to showcase some very real and heartbreaking moments. Especially Hutcherson, who sheds all the annoyance he embodied in the first film, and brings a new life and lust to his eyes. I was quite taken by what he was doing and where's going.the-hunger-games-mockingjay-part-1-sliceDonald Sutherland is a fantastic villain. The ying to Katniss' yang, the two are practically in an abusive love affair and it works tremendously. They're the two opposite spectrums of this new world where war rages on and the dead are not necessarily the unlikely ones. Julianne Moore, Woody Harrelson and the late Philip Seymour Hoffman are equally amazing in good measure of their respective roles. The pinnacle of the performers, and has been for this entire franchise is Elizabeth Banks. As Effie, she's embodied a soul plucked from her normal environment and thrust into the battle grounds of something she doesn't fully understand. Her appearances are both funny but impeccably warm. I hope people notice how vital and important she's been to the franchise, which should lead her to more vital and vivacious roles in the future.Francis Lawrence makes artistic choices that keep the audience at arm's length. Some of it is deliberate to hide things I'm sure we will know in the next installment. Some of it, is deathly obvious, bringing suspicion and tension to characters we know are going to be forces to be reckoned with. For the most part, everything is standard filmmaking. Something as massively popular as this needs to be to get the widest audience possible. I do wonder if that wasn't the focus on Lionsgate, and if they attempted to be more gritty with the material, show the destruction and blood of the people, and go up to an 'R' rating, if this isn't elevated significantly? Can only wonder.Overall, 'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1' is very satisfying. Setting the chess pieces of what is destined to be an epic finale, it's one of the best things you can bring your family these upcoming weeks leading to the holiday season. I took my 14-year-old niece to see it, and she emphatically expressed 'Oh my God! It was amazing!' You can't beat that.",7,7,37,19 November 2014
Black Swan," Portman is a beautiful swan...
","Darren Aronofsky, the director of the Oscar snubbed films 'The Wrestler' and 'Requiem for a Dream' has created his most emotionally and visually charged film yet, 'Black Swan.' Showcasing a career best performance from Natalie Portman, this dark, demented, and at times brilliant take on the world of ballet assures any doubt of Aronofsky's depth. He goes back to his roots while revamping and maturing his own style. A complex yet simple concept from screenwriters Mark Heyman, Andres Heinz, and John J. McLaughlin marries with the director artistic capabilities like a great love story. Cinematographer Matthew Libatique nearly narrates this tale with such ferocity, it leaves the viewer breathless. Clint Mansell who has been ignored for far too long orchestrates once again, a magnificent score that hopefully will not be ignored. Supporting players Mila Kunis and Barbara Hershey respect their roles and deliver them poignantly throughout. But once again, enough cannot be said about Academy Award Nominee Natalie Portman. This is the role I will remember Natalie Portman for forever. She balances a broken, wounded character and breathes a hungry, cannibalistic woman tearing through the screen, frame after frame after frame. Definitely one of, if not, the best performance by any actor this year. 'Black Swan' should be proud to be standing on its own merit with no obvious plot or clear ideas, just pure imagination and curiosity keeps us involved. Brilliant execution Mr. Aronofsky, just brilliant.",9,4,9,5 December 2010
Changeling," Angelina Jolie has Changed....
","Clint Eastwood has mastered another very intelligent, captivating piece of cinema. Again, his style is as potent as ever with his use of colors, sharp editing, and shading contrasts. The story is as crisp as any but needs some heavy lifting to get off the ground. Angelina Jolie is the answer to that problem in her most powerful portrayal to date, Ms. Jolie is absolutely incredible.John Malkovich's role doesn't demand much of him rather than a few intense faces but as always, he's the dependable actor. Jason Butler Harner takes on the 'villain' role and utterly transforms it a la Jackie Earle Haley in Little Children.The rest of the cast is great especially Jeffrey Donovan who shackles the corrupt cop role and takes on arrogance and certainty to a new level.Script. OK. Story. Not bad. Direction. Seen better from Eastwood. Oscar worthy? Maybe just for Jolie.***/****",8,4,6,25 November 2008
Frost_Nixon," Good Night and Good Luck on Steroids....
","...which is a good thing. Completely gives the emotional touch that George Clooney's film, Good Night, and Good Luck missed out on. Ron Howard's film is completely real and utterly unlike any previous efforts on his part. Frank Langella and Michael Sheen are completely engulfed in their roles that were such hits on Broadway.Langella doesn't go with the caricatures of Richard Nixon and shares his own interpretation of a ruthless man. Michael Sheen shows us a vulnerability never before seen in the actor and puts his love into the hearts of viewers.This is truly incredible despite draggy in parts.***1/2/****",9,1,4,8 January 2009
Walk the Line," Phoenix is Mr. Oscar!
","Walk the Line Let's all sit here for one second and discuss the formula in making a biopic about a legend. First of all, why would anyone want to make a film about someone? Well the obvious reasons would include popularity. For example Ray Charles had a huge fan base that included people from the older generation and even a select few from the newer. Johnny Cash's popularity didn't string some much up to urban areas or any coast cities but pretty much there are a good number of people that heard of the name Johnny Cash. The next part of the formula has to be the actual story of the person; the struggle to the top, the origins of the person, an overcoming such as drug addiction or an abusive relationship, (i.e. 'What's Love Got to Do With It?') and a settling ending to their story even if they are still living. The film which follows Cash's early childhood up to his engagement to June Carter gives all these elements of a biopic and that's exactly where this film fell short.Director James Mangold whom many people have never heard prior to Walk the Line had a true opportunity to shine and show us all something that had never been seen before. The film starts and ends very strongly but there is a true sense of hollowness in the center of the film. Not too sure yet of what it is, could be the screenplay or even just the story of Cash himself but I was really eager to get the ball rolling again about an hour in. Twenty minutes pass and ball really rolled. It's a bit of a random upset and not too sure if I was just getting distracted but it is what it is.Now!...............the performances! Oh my god, can we give Mr. Joaquin Phoenix an Oscar! This man truly is talented. After being a true supporting player for the past couple of years he has made a great transition into a leading man. This movie is all about Phoenix and how he embodies this man. I have to do it; the comparison of this performance to Jamie Foxx's performance in last year's Oscar winning role in 'Ray.' The difference is that Phoenix really elevated the material and I get he got that from somewhere not on the set or watching a video or any meeting with Cash if there was one. Phoenix takes the performance to a brand new level and at any point do I ever feel like it's a mimic which is what I felt Foxx did. Phoenix gave so much emotion from his speeches to his singing to his rapid eye movements. Phoenix is the true frontrunner at the Oscars as of now.Reese Witherspoon has finally lived up to expectations. For the past four or five years I've heard a lot of comparisons to Julia Roberts. I never believed it because Julia is one of a kind but Witherspoon truly is talented. Her singing is beautiful and gives a jaw-dropping performance as June Carter. As of the rumor going around saying that she will win Oscar, it can happen but due to the lack of contention in the category. But if Joan Allen is nominated which I feel she will be, she will most likely win Oscar. Five nominations and no win along with losing to newbie Witherspoon won't really sit well with voters and fellow Oscar lovers. But she is a lock for nomination. (I hate saying lock because academy does stupid stuff all the time.) The supporting cast is perfect as well ranging from Dallas Roberts to overbearing father Ray Cash played exquisitely by Robert Patrick to the suffering first wife of Cash, Vivian, played by Ginnifer Goodwin who can give you pains in your stomach because she makes you hate her so much. A great ensemble I must say.Walk the Line is a great experience and can get the best picture nomination that people are predicting but it WILL NOT win the top prize. Nothing too spectacular about it and there's so much left to be seen. I'm walking the line in including this in my top five of the year so far. We'll seeÂ… Grade: ***/****",Null,3,6,19 November 2005
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," OVERRATED but still funny
","Starring Sacha Baron Cohen of 'Da Ali G Show,' Borat! is a roaring upbeat and different comedy to the contemporary world of cinema. Larry Charles, co-creator of television hits, 'Entourage' and 'The Tick' directs this hilarious documentary-style picture.Cohen stars as the hilarious goofball from the great nation of Kazakhstan on a mission to learn about American culture. Along with his friend Azamat, (Ken Davitian) they go on wacky adventures and educational expeditions. All changes until Borat catches an episode of 'Baywatch' and sees Pamela Anderson. His agenda then becomes to travel to California to capture the lady's heart.Sacha Baron Cohen inhabits Mr. Borat with his famous antics and even more funny wit. Being touted as one of the best performances of the year is a bit of a stretch, the film lacks a lot of the flavor I presumed based on word of mouth. Cohen holds it together most of the time without going over the top, the film's lack of smart comedy in lieu of slapstick, grotesque comedy is a little overwhelming.As his overweight friend, to say the least, Davitian brings an different element to the film but he is the main reason for the grotesque humor stated earlier. Not as clever as Cohen, the performance is an admiral turn nonetheless.The perfect way to describe this piece is overrated. Funniest film of all time? Definitely not. Oscar-worthy? Not a chance. The surprise screenplay nomination? Are you kidding me. Popcorn movie, that's what this is. It didn't raise the bar for comedic films, it kept it exactly where was before.Grade: ***/****",7,4,9,22 October 2007
Captain Phillips," Paul Greengrass directs another tension driven film bringing Tom Hanks to the forefront...
","Hours after the World Premiere of Paul Greengrass' newest psychological thriller 'Captain Phillips,' my heart is still palpating at a hundred beats per minute. Starring the magnificent Tom Hanks in his finest performance since 'Cast Away,' this edge-of-your-seat thrill ride lands as one of the best films of the New York Film Festival and the year.An intricate and precisely executed thriller written by Billy Ray, everything about 'Captain Phillips' works amazingly. It's this year's 'Zero Dark Thirty' in tension and features not one, but two fierce performances from Tom Hanks and newcomer Barkhad Abdi. A loose dramatization and not a fact to fact retelling of a dark day for an American captain, the film takes us through the days Captain Richard Phillips' cargo ship was hijacked by Somali pirates in 2009. The film unravels itself with a narrative intensity bringing our hero from the day of his departure to the end of his journey. Writer Billy Ray's detailed and well-structured script provides Greengrass to do exactly what he does best in his directorial efforts. There are definite elements in 'Captain Phillips' that remind me of the emotional and gut- wrenching effect that 'United 93' had on so many of us nearly seven years ago. While you will have a near heart attack, you will be in tears by the end credits.I haven't been this impressed with the work of Tom Hanks in years. Putting every ounce of his charm to good use but digging deep into a character with such raw and emotional fervency. Hanks' dedication and abilities utilized are the same tools used in his first Oscar-winning performance in 'Philadelphia' I assure you. It's a turn that could make him this year's Daniel Day-Lewis. As his wife, the beautiful Catherine Keener is regulated to one single scene, at the beginning of our film, where Hanks dominates the conversation. Still a cherry on top if you ask me but not something that many will notice nor remember..Breakthrough performer Barkhad Abdi is simply sensational. With a snarky demeanor as he calls Capt. Phillips 'Irish' - Abdi plays Muse, a Somali pirate that is layered with pride and disdain for the human condition. Billy Ray gives him such a complexity, hinting at a sensitive undertone but not masking the overtly violent rage that embodies his soul; it's a creative formula that equals an interesting dichotomy. Abdi administers these traits brilliantly.As you expect any Paul Greengrass film to be, the technical executions are top-notch including the intimate Cinematography by Barry Ackroyd and the tight editing of Christopher Rouse, both sure-fire Oscar nominees for awards season. One of the amazing things about 'Captain Phillips' is the final twenty minutes or so. Pent-up emotion that has built for nearly two hours, our hero's last moments with the audience are both triumphant and incredibly vulnerable. This is when Tom Hanks shows his true power as one of the finest actors to grace our screens. I admire the man. He captures the real human condition, both in courage and in the face of defeat. How would you react in what you thought could be your final moments on Earth? Who would you think about? What about if you did make it? Would you be so overcome with emotion that you couldn't focus on the blanket of safety that surrounds you, or would you just crumble into the fetus position, wanting to return to your place of origin? 'Captain Phillips' renewed my love of the movies. It's what breathes life into my daily routine. It fascinates us and which is why, no matter how terrible our lives are, or how the economy falls beneath our feet, cinema still lives. Free as a bird. I'm in awe of all of this. I feel privileged to share those moments. Not to be hyperbolic or put focus on the Oscar race, which is what I do for a living, but 'Captain Phillips' showed me what Tom Hanks really means to cinema. Our lives are habitual and ordinary at times, yet someone, every now and again, has the ability to capture those little quirks of our own selves. I think Hanks is this generation's treasure that will be remembered for years to come. I'm in near tears as I write this now. Paul Greengrass brought me personally into a situation that I will likely never be in and examined my frail and defenseless spiritual nature. Connection. That's what cinema is about. Few films do this. Many never will.To get off the somber note, 'Captain Phillips' is filled with high- levels of tension. Bring your defibrillator and a bottle of Xanex to make it through the picture as your heart will be beating outside of your chest. In so many ways, it's the perfect film. Real life, authentic characters, and a cast and crew that show up to deliver some of their finest works. A dynamite lesson of the human psyche.'Captain Phillips' opens in theaters October 11.",10,240,350,27 September 2013
3:10 to Yuma," 3:10 is just about a TEN
","From director James Mangold comes the remake of the popular 1957 film starring Academy Award winner Russell Crowe and Christian Bale. The film tells the story of Ben Wade, (Crowe) a thief/gunslinger captured by local authorities and awaiting to be transported on the 3:10 train to Yuma for trial and conviction. Being accompanied by an array of lawmen, in the middle of all this is Dan Evans (Bale) who takes on this daunting task to support his family and get enough funds to save his ranch.Mangold has complete control of the film from beginning to end and never loses focus of the old western. He revolutionizes it and alas, keeps the same character and charisma it had in the early years of cinema. Deciding on shots and creating moments that sends sheer fear down the viewer's spine is the least of the director's achievement. He commands this ship and leads the players in some of the finest performances of the year. However there are some flaws with the script and pacing of the picture but all in all, you cannot ask for more from the film.Russell Crowe who may not be the friendliest person in Hollywood to most is undoubtedly one of our finest actors working today. He captures a strong grip on Ben Wade and chooses to chew up all scenery he's in. His villainous turn which is reminiscent of past performances such as Daniel Day-Lewis in Gangs of New York and Leonardo DiCaprio in Blood Diamond has the viewer rooting for him when you know you really shouldn't; a compelling turn for the actor indeed.Christian Bale which has been Hollywood's best kept secret for some time and is a household name is terrific as always. While being the most sympathetic of any characters on screen, he gives the viewer encouragement and anguish; a task not easy for many actors. His Dan Evans is completely lost in his life, while being nearly estranged from his older son and being permanently 'scarred' to say the least from war, Dan is the champion of the story. Bale has been an up and comer for some time as far as awards consideration goes and exceedingly been left off many a time. With acclaimed performances in American Psycho, Batman Begins, and The Prestige and early year raved performance in Rescue Dawn, Bale may find himself amongst the list of candidates come Oscar time. Although he does share a co-lead with Crowe and may find himself pushed in supporting as studios sometimes do. But with amazing supporting performances in the film, he is overshadowed there as well.Ben Foster is the triumph of the picture as Ben Wade's right hand man and turns in the actor's most frightening turn to date. He might be seeing himself with a few breakthrough awards this coming awards season if momentum builds. Peter Fonda has a very simple role but dignifies the old western man so profound. Fonda which has been long ignored by the Academy with only one nomination to his credit doesn't have enough scenery to chew on to get the glorified veteran nomination. Dallas Roberts and newcomer Logan Lerman turn in excellent performances respectively. Gretchen Mol is also quite staggering in her blink and miss role.The film is quite the triumph and rolls out the red carpet for more western to return to Hollywood. The film will be followed later this year with The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford and we look forward to a few more instances of great westerns to come.The film will have an uphill climb for Oscar season especially with hopes of a Best Picture nomination. Being a remake, two co-leads and slew of bigger pet projects coming in the months of Oscar, its true shot will lie in the Original Score category for Marco Beltrami, which along with a great cinematography by Phedon Papamichael are the best technical aspects of the film.It looks to be a great movie year thus far with a much surprise love for western cinema back in the light.Grade: ***1/2/****",8,1,2,17 September 2007
The Hangover," What a great hangover!
","Todd Phillips, who has been a director who really misses his mark (with the exception of Old School) has landed his footing among comedic filmmakers. The Hangover is my favorite comedy of the year so far and is sure to become a cult classic among college students and young people.The film tells the story of Doug (Justin Bartha), a middle aged man who goes on a bachelor night with his best friends, Stu (Ed Helms, 'Andy' from 'The Office'), Phil (Bradley Cooper), and his fiancée's strange brother Alan (breakthrough performer Zach Galifianakis). After a night of heavy drinking and waking up to a missing Doug, the three amigos venture out to find clues to their missing comrade. The comedy here is incredible with the raunchy humor that hits and sticks every time. The script keeps a great pace and keeps you laughing the whole time. Helms and Galifianakis hit hugely in this film and steal the show every time. The Hangover never loses sight of its objective and remembers its target audience. Through the laughs we are immensely stuck on these four guys and their quest to find fallen mate. There's actually a wonderful love story wrapped up in all laughs and a wonderful lesson to be learned....don't drink jagermeister!****/****",9,3,6,15 June 2009
Deepwater Horizon," 'Deepwater Horizon' Shows Fury and Technique from Director Peter Berg
","Real stories about tragic events have the advantage of being harrowing without much effort because the accounts of the truth do much of the job for them. It takes a distinct type of filmmaker to raise the film above the standard. While director Peter Berg doesn't completely connect the dots, he promotes a tale of responsibility that will antagonize the wrath inside of all of us. 'Deepwater Horizon' rallies emotion in the wake of truth.'Deepwater Horizon' tells the tragic true story of the oil driller that due to negligence and fault of the BP Oil Company, created the worst oil spill in history.Mark Wahlberg is an actor I've tended to be harder on than most lately with his choice of roles. Here he puts forth a genuine, heartfelt portrayal. Always placing himself in the 'hero' position, he manages to tap into a delicate enactment of a man desperate to survive. He gets to show off a new accent that isn't south Boston, while digging deep to show real emotion. It's his best performance since 'The Fighter.'The film boasts an all-star cast, some of which are doing adequate work. As the ship's captain, Kurt Russell continues to explore lively, vigorous roles in his later career. John Malkovich does all but twirl his mustache as the corrupt and pushy executive. Gina Rodriguez steps out of her 'Jane the Virgin' motif to investigate a new, compassionate character and achieves a noble offering. Oscar nominee Kate Hudson plays the famed 'woman on phone,' but in some cases, just 'woman on Skype.'Berg's direction has been problematic on bigger blockbusters like 'Battleship,' but with penetrating and vital material he gets to show the world what he can truly attain. Arguably not as emotionally resourceful as 'Lone Survivor,' it is perhaps cleaner in its assimilation of story and filmmaking technique. He runs the bases with his editing and sound team. They pulsate tension like there is an unlimited supply. Ingesting the central concept will undoubtedly infuriate the viewer as we're shown another key example of money corrupting our beloved Mother Earth. It provokes a sense of a revolution within yourself in exchange for liberating your own customary ideals of the standard 'based on a true story' movie. It just presents the facts, and not much else.'Deepwater Horizon' has heart. It has passion. It has a willingness to take the viewer into the dark and terrifying scene of that fateful day. With a more comprehensive script or more deeply natured approach in the future, Berg may be able to create his masterpiece, whatever that may end up being.GRADE: (★★★)",7,0,0,19 February 2017
United 93," The soul is alive
","United 93 Honorable, heart-breaking, proud, frustrating, angry, endearing, bravery, unbelievable, morose, and about a million other verbs, adverbs, or whatever other superlatives you can think of will cross the mind upon the experience called United 93. This film opens up old wounds and creates new ones. How could this possibly happen? Why didn't people move faster? Where in God's name was Bush? Why them? Why us? You are put on the doomed plane with forty extraordinary ladies and gentleman. You are so proud when this film is over and not to be an American but to be a part of the human race. At mankind's peek of expiration the spirit becomes alive and is evident in actions and words. I try not to look at this subjectively. Living so close to New York City and witnessing the attacks happen right in front of your eyes does make this experience that much harder. I will agree with a lot of people and say this might have been too soon to start giving the different perspectives on the attacks but it's been made and we have to deal with it. This is a film that you really don't want to see that you should see. Paul Greengrass took a huge risk on making this film and he does the passengers, the families, and the rest of mankind justice.The most hurtful thing of this process wasn't the actual things in the film taking place but the mystery that is left afterwards. We will never know in this world and lifetime what happened on that plane, we will never know what it felt like to be on that plane or to be the loved one of a person being called by someone on that plane, but we do know that if you are reading this review right now than you are alive and that is a blessing in its own.There are no performances that stick out unless you give it to all the passengers as an ensemble. (hint: Screen Actors Guild) I'm not sure if this could make it to the ceremony. I on one hand loved the film for its brutal honesty and hate it because it's a constant reminder of evil. I will probably never see this film again, I'll own it on DVD just because I'm a freak like that but living through that day over and over again is just something I don't want to do. Possible nominations for Picture, Director, Screenplay, and the technical categories. If our Academy is touched as I am by this film they will want to reward it with at least a nomination otherwise it will play as another 'Passion of the Christ.' Touches the hearts of people yet will stir up the controversy.Your eyes will dry out, you'll feel the sense of redemption, you'll pray to everything higher than you that Paul Greengrass will make a different ending even though we all know how it ends. You want these people to live, you want peace, you want happiness, you want the love of the father to come down and prevent the tragedy from occurring but that doesn't happen. What we are left with is a tortured heart and pain stricken soul that will always wonder why the beauty of mankind is shown in the unknown? A round of applause to the cast, crew, Mr. Greengrass, and to the individuals involved in the attacks for showing us that in the darkest hour of man, the brightest light can be shown and love can always breakthrough.Grade: ****/****",10,10,23,28 April 2006
Gravity," 'Gravity' lives up to the hype with Sandra Bullock's crowning achievement intact (★★★★)
","There is a sensational and overwhelming power that Alfonso Cuarón's space thriller 'Gravity' possesses and manages to sustain in its 90 minute run time. I think I left my jaw on the theater floor. There are four things in particular to credit for this occurrence. The first of which being co-writer and director Cuarón, who has constructed one of his finest outings. 'Gravity' breathes in a way I haven't seen before and is probably one of the best technical marvels that cinema has offered in the past twenty years. Cuarón handles the film with absolute certainty, restraining himself from committing any science fiction bourgeois, and reinventing the genre in a miraculous execution. I've never looked at the world of Cinematography with so much respect and adoration until I saw the works of Roger Deakins and now, firmly sitting next to him at the table as the most innovative and brilliant DP working today, Emmanuel Lubezki. We've all seen what he's accomplished in his Oscar-nominated works in 'Children of Men,' in which he was teamed up with Cuarón, and Terrence Malick's 'The Tree of Life,' both of which resulted in unimaginable losses. A 13-minute opening shot shows his abilities to capture the essence of the now, the feelings that life offers. Real life doesn't cut, Cuarón and Lubezki understand this. The liberties where he chooses to take us, even when we step inside from the cold, lonely edge of space, manages to turn this very simple tale into a full-fledged meditation session with the sooth sounds of composer Steven Price. Visual effects have never been put to better use than what you will witness in 'Gravity.' One of the few films I urge everyone to see on the biggest screen possible. The post-conversion in 3D, although cool at times, was a bit unneeded. It doesn't add to the depth and scope of Cuarón's dramatic endeavor, it actually undersells it as a cheap, blockbuster space movie. An IMAX screen, the largest you can find, with a sound system able to make your eardrums bleed, those are the basic requirements. I haven't been in this much awe of a film's quality and optics this since I saw 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day' when I was six years old. 'Avatar' and 'Life of Pi' are great spectacles, but this will be revisited in years to come as the bench mark for modern day science fiction. It's this generation's '2001: A Space Odyssey.'Finally, I've had a childhood crush on Sandra Bullock since I feasted my eyes on those pretty browns driving a bus in 'Speed' during the early 90's. This manifested into looking at her abilities as an actor with a skewed vision. She's hinted at this greatness I've felt she could achieve in films like 'A Time to Kill,' 'Crash,' and her Oscar-winning role in 'The Blind Side.' Sandra Bullock has finally realized her potential as a leading lady and taps into the very essence of the human spirit as Dr. Ryan Stone; a work that stands as her greatest endeavor and her gift to the silver screen. Natural, poised, and fully engulfed, Bullock is absolutely magnificent and in many ways, my favorite performance of the year so far. She rallies an emotional connection from the audience and demands things of herself that she hasn't done before. An Oscar-worthy work that should land her as a Best Actress nominee...and perhaps a winner.George Clooney as Matt Kowalsky is exactly what you'd come to expect from the Oscar-winning producer and actor. He utilizes his wit and charm to be a lighter force of our dark tale, and is a perfect balance to Bullock's frantic demeanor. As aforementioned, Steven Price's musical work is tenderly utilized and precisely executed, building up lots of affectionate tones that may leave some audience members in tears. The script by Alfonso Cuarón and son Jonas Cuarón inhabit a rich texture of dialogue that aren't thrown in for the sake of breaking the silence. They aren't afraid to let the scenery speak for itself or to let the actors portray their emotions in mannerisms, but when they step away from that, everything connects beautifully.'Gravity' is a rare breed. Simplistic but so refreshingly new. Visually, it will be studied for years to come, and thematically, will be revisited by the genre's most ardent enthusiasts. One of the best films of the year. I'll say, if you haven't watched the trailers and clips, continue to do so. Too much information.",10,503,989,20 September 2013
Fury," David Ayer's war epic is a tightly constructed cinematic piece featuring standout works from Brad Pitt and Logan Lerman...
","You want some intensity, heart palpitations, and just sheer pulse- pounding action? You don't need to look much further than David Ayer's monumental war film 'Fury' with an all-star cast that includes Brad Pitt, Logan Lerman, Shia LeBeouf, Michael Pena, and Jon Bernthal. In the vein of any edge-of-your-seat thrill ride experienced over the past few years, 'Fury' ignites a passionate look at the brotherhood of war and the beauty that can peak its head out every now and again. Honest, raw, and vividly shot, Ayer's war epic stands as one of the best surprises the year has offered.With elements of Steven Spielberg's 'Saving Private Ryan' and a 'dinner scene' that would put 'Django Unchained' to absolute shame, 'Fury' is full of wit, charm, and affection. The film takes place in April 1945 Germany. A five-man crew of a Sherman tank, lead by a battle- hardened sergeant named Wardaddy, take on near-impossible odds to hit the heart of the opposition towards the end of the war. When a rookie infantry member joins the group, they will learn several things about each other, and ultimately themselves, in the face of a motherless war.How can you start anywhere else, without beginning with the writer and director David Ayer? Already gaining a legion of fans following 'End of Watch,' the impressive filmmaker takes on a new realm of storytelling that feels intimate, and consequently real. We spend over 60% of the film, inside the belly of a mechanical beast. Paul Greengrass executed a similar take with 'Captain Phillips' last year in the lifeboat, and Ayer illustrates the same quality that is sure to be appreciated and loved. From a directorial standpoint, Ayer is unmatched by any action filmmaker that has hit screens this year. He owns every shot, every emotion, and every ounce of pride that the cast and crew exhibit. He controls the ship (or in this case TANK) with an effortless ease. There will be no doubt that this is a testosterone driven film, and the average movie guy will be screaming from the rooftops in an action-packed blissful state. However, there is an emotional core that is so very present in every scene, even when its ugly, that it allows an accessibility to every movie-goer. You won't find a more genuine depiction of war since 'The Hurt Locker.'From a writing standpoint, Ayer puts forth a solidly valiant effort, with minor missteps along the way. I would have wanted less clichéd behaviors from certain characters at times, even some richer dialogue. Ayer constructs his story with precision. He absolutely knows when, what, and how he wants his characters to react. Every action feels fluid, and moving towards an ultimate resolution. He finds the beats of a scene quite well and at over two hours, the film moves like a freight train. You never feel a second. I do feel that Ayer missed out on some opportunities for a 'real' breakthrough in a character, or a revealing quality of a character that didn't feel like I've seen it before. There were moments that were predictable but in no way do they bog down the overall experience of 'Fury.'A slick and magnetic ensemble are present on screen. This is one of the best performances that Brad Pitt has ever done. Continuously pushing himself as an actor, his depth and vigor are both alluring and hypnotic to watch. The real breakout star of the film is none other than Logan Lerman. Already exhibiting an awards worthy performance in Stephen Chbosky's 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' over two years ago, if there was any doubt that this young man is one of the most exciting actors to watch, they should be laid to rest. Lerman is sensational from front to end. Calling back some young actors that have played in war films and have stood out (I kept coming back to Jeremy Davies' unrequited work in 'Saving Private Ryan'), he plainly steals the movie from underneath every actor's eye. Lerman's work is an awards- caliber performance that the Academy Awards should not hesitate to recognize.Co-stars Jon Bernthal, Michael Pena, and especially Shia LeBeouf all have individual moments to shine. Bernthal is a tornado of frenzy rage, taking out everything in his path. LeBeouf calls back to his stunning work in 'A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints' from nearly a decade ago. Quietly powerful but loudly present. Pena is your most underwritten and clichéd character, but someone of Pena's talent ability, rises above in nearly every instance.'Fury' has an abundance of technical highlights. Recent Oscar- winning composer Steven Price, puts forth another emotionally resonate score that stands out. Cinematographer Roman Vasyanov captures shots of anxiety and concentration that only a master could accomplish. Film Editor Dody Dorn, who's crowning work will always be Christopher Nolan's 'Memento,' should be commended for making a 135 minute war epic, feel like a fleeting anxiety attack.'Fury' is an emotional extremity. You don't get films like this that both operate on an accessible entertainment level for all audiences and still remain awards-caliber. It's a tremendous achievement, unforgettable, and one of the richly rewarding films of the year.",7,1,5,29 October 2014
Inglourious Basterds," The Tarantino-Waltz Show---Welcome
","Quentin Tarantino, one of the most iconic film directors of cinematic history, has created one of his best efforts yet in Inglourious Basterds. There's so much brilliance that Tarantino brings to the table in his newest film. Most notably, it's an unconventional World War II film that is not to be taken as a biopic or anything that resembles history. Tarantino tackles the tough subject matter with respect and diligence. He lives in a time of horror and torment and breathes new light into a repetitive subject (not that I have a problem with Holocaust films).It's a good place to start with the marketing strategy of the Weinstein Company by advertising Brad Pitt as the star lead when its anything but. Did it get more people in the theaters? Probably. But Tarantino is such a cult phenomenon that his name alone could have filled some seats. But marketing aside, this is Tarantino's second best film of his career (can never top Pulp Fiction I guess) but his most original and clever work to date.Brad Pitt's performance is definitely the unsung hero of the picture. It seems as if all his really terrific performances go unnoticed and they make it up with rewarding mediocre performances like last year's The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. Pitt has showed such versatility late in his career such as his 'Jesse James' or Chad in Burn After Reading or Richard in Babel. Pitt is showing his strings of acting. Now, he brings us Lt. Aldo Raine, the leader of the 'basterds' and charismatic killer of the Nazis. Pitt is intelligent, hilarious and engulfed in a role that deserves praise. His role should not, however, be interpreted as a lead role for Pitt becomes a part of an ensemble piece with different integrated parts which makes for a terrific motion picture.At this point, we've heard the praise for Christoph Waltz whose villainous turn as Col. Hans Landa is one of the most terrifying turns in our new century of cinema. Waltz is daring and frightening to the depth of quivers rushing down your spine as you watch his monologues or hyper-tension questioning. Waltz is something of a marvel and should be considered a threat for an Academy Award next season. Going back to great portrayals such as Anthony Perkins in Psycho or Louise Fletcher in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Waltz joins the elite list of screens greatest villainous turns.Other supporting players put forth valiant efforts. Melanie Laurent and Diane Kruger pull in strong performances in a very testosterone driven picture. Eli Roth, despite his brief screen time does the best especially with his introduction a.k.a. 'The Bear Jew' monologue. The only flaw of the film is it suffers in a mid-film stalemate notably with the cameo by Mike Myers which feels forced and unnatural.Oscar prospects? In a perfect world, it'd be in all categories. In serious light, Waltz is a definite contender in his respective category and Tarantino can find himself in the screenplay race once again if guilds take notice. Inglourious Basterds is one of the best films of the year, mark my words.***½/****",9,2,9,23 August 2009
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," 'Rogue One: A Star Wars Story' Is an Arresting New Chapter for Fans and Newcomers to Relish
","The 'Star Wars' universe is a world of endless possibilities about what stories you can explore, with an unprecedented amount of quality thematic elements that can be examined. With 'Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,' Lucas Films and Walt Disney Pictures have started the analyzing elements of looking at different ways to tell the stories of some of our most beloved characters, while introducing new ones. Gareth Edwards' firm direction, in partnership with Greig Fraser's stunning cinematography, makes for a lavish and intense new chapter in the 'Star Wars' mythology.The first of the Star Wars standalone films, 'Rogue One: A Star Wars Story' tells the story of a group of unlikely heroes that band together on a mission to steal the plans to the Death Star, the Empire's ultimate weapon of destruction.Boasting an impressive cast that is led by Academy Award nominee Felicity Jones, it is one of the film's best attributes. Diversity in film has been called upon by every corner of the cinematic community and 'Star Wars,' Lucas Films, and Walt Disney do not get enough credit in being of the first to fully embrace this notion into its most profitable franchise. As Jyn Erso, Jones leads with intensity, delivering a near heartbreaking interpretation of the most unlikely hero.Of the players, the fanboys of the universe will scream the names of Chirru Imwe, played exquisitely by Donnie Yen, or K-2SO, played with spunk by Alan Tudyk. You'll have your fill with Cassian Andor (Diego Luna), whose stern presence isn't always a standout, but Bodhi Rook (played by Riz Ahmed) seems like a spirit animal of Poe from 'The Force Awakens.'Villains here have no shortage of complexities, as Ben Mendelsohn's Orson Krennic is sensational, given alongside some other 'amazing' surprises. I'll leave them for you to experience yourself.Technically speaking, this is one of the franchise's most vivacious productions. The aforementioned Greig Fraser delivers grit and action in his abilities to capture them with the lens. John Gilroy, Colin Goudie and Jabez Olssen cut the film to an impeccable action- adventure that stands toe-to-toe with anything delivered in 2016.Having big shoes to fill in John Williams' illustrious classic score, Michael Giacchino rises to the occasion and then some with his compositions. It's one of the year's best works. Doug Chiang and Neil Lamont's production design opens the doors to a new world that doesn't feel too familiar or too standard for the average fan.'Star Wars' is only as good as its story and script. Chris Weitz, Tony Gilroy, John Knoll and Gary Whitta lay the foundation down for an alluring tale. On paper, hearing about how the rebels acquire the Death Star plans is not particularly compelling cinema that we are running to see, but this group accepts the challenge. With the exception of some shoehorned entries of new and classic characters, 'Rogue One' finds its balance in presenting this world to an avid die-hard fan and a casual movie-goer that is walking into this universe for the very first time.Early reports of a 'darker' and 'more gritty' film have been around for months. We definitely have that here, but the insert of comedic beats often feel inserted so the audience can feel some joy in this tragic tale. It's safe to say that we are more than prepared for a devastation story that wrecks the minds of viewers everywhere – perhaps with 'Episode VIII?'Here is the main takeaway: this film has perhaps the best Darth Vader scene in franchise history. Let's talk about it in the comments after you see it.'Rogue One: A Star Wars Story' successfully achieves everything it sets out to do. Action-packed and glorious in its engaging and oftentimes exotic dimensions of storytelling, it is absolutely stirring. Fans will be overjoyed and it becomes another classic chapter that we will be able to revisit in a weekend-long marathon somewhere in a galaxy far, far away.GRADE: (★★★½)",8,1,2,19 February 2017
Coraline," Coraline is visually stunning, narratively incredible
","From Henry Selick, the visionary director of The Nightmare Before Christmas and James and the Giant Peach comes the film adaptation of Coraline. The story of a young girl who finds a world all her own until her dream becomes a very realistic nightmare.Dakota Fanning voices the young Coraline and brings spunk and personality to a young heroin. Teri Hatcher in the villainous role of Coraline's alternate mother is simply marvelous. A terrific voice-acting performance and not since Ellen Degeneres have we seen an actress so involved. The rest of the usual suspects are there, Jennifer Saunders, Keith David, and Ian McShane. The story is very well told and in my humble opinion, not suitable at all for children. This is a lot even for me. It almost plays out like a horror film, building suspense and pulling us through this tall tale.Worth a watch and definitely in consideration for an Animated Feature Film nomination. Go through the door.***/****",7,0,3,19 March 2009
The Impossible," Watts and Holland own it...One of the Best Pictures of the Year!
","A film that captures real life the way J.A. Bayona captures it in his newest film The Impossible is a rare occurrence in filmmaking. Not only does he pay respect to the countless victims that were lost in the devastating tragedy, he makes artistic choices and liberties only the most seasoned directors can take. Starring Academy Award Nominee Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor, the film tells the TRUE story about a family vacationing in Thailand when one of the worst natural disasters of our time separates them.In the opening credits of the film, Bayona tells the audience that the story is true, but what may bother viewers and critics is how coincidental and inflated the story can seem. If it weren't in fact true, the film would fail within the first few moments. It's the notion that this did occur that demonstrates and heightens the execution of Bayona and writer Sergio G. Sanchez so brilliantly. The Impossible is the most emotional and devastating picture seen since Paul Greengrass' United 93 (2006). In the first several minutes, I was already in tears. Letting up only for short breaths, I feel like I didn't stop crying the entire time. I was invested, full body and soul, riding among the victims in a frightening state of mind. I could only imagine myself there, terrifyingly so and with appreciation now that I wasn't. The brave and committed performance by Naomi Watts is the miracle of the film and possibly the entire year. Watts falls into the role of 'Maria' with perfect precision and accuracy. As a person who's only been a father for a year-and-a-half, Watts puts me right in the moment of unimaginable fear and pain. An Oscar-caliber turn as I've ever witnessed. The entire first half of the film is shared with Tom Holland, a child actor that can only be described as well beyond his years. Holland is motivated and equally as afflicting as Watts. A performance like his can only lead to more roles for him in the future. Ewan McGregor, who unbeknownst to me as gone this long without receiving any type of Oscar attention is pure magic. He shows an effortless approach as Henry, a father desperate to find his family. If there's one poor criticism about the film it's the first half of the film, where Holland and Watts dominate, is so gut-wrenching and brilliant that when McGregor and his story enter the screen, it unfortunately just pales by comparison. McGregor isn't given the most of character development to chew through but it's still an admirable work.Cinematographer Oscar Faura's orange and yellow camera work demands the utmost attention from the viewer, gaining a near first-person view of what could have been. It's a technical achievement of the highest levels. Fernando Velasquez's somber score will only build the tears even more as your catapulted through this reenactment of terror. J.A. Bayona's direction is simplistic but delivered with reverence. A fine directorial turn.This is a film that must be experienced by all. As you lay in your cozy beds tonight, take your loved ones for granted as they walk by you, and breath the air you so blindly feel entitled to, think about if at one moment, one single moment, from now, it was all gone. The Impossible dared me to be a better human being, a notion not many films will or attempt to convey. I'll try to listen.It's one of the best pictures of the year!Read more reviews @ The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com)",8,196,272,28 September 2012
Public Enemies," Johnny and Mann's best in years...
","Michael Mann's Public Enemies is definitely one of the best films of the year and probably the strongest of his career. Taking into account Heat (savagely overrated), The Insider (his only Oscar nominated work and definitely worth it), and Collateral (which fails for me on multiple levels), when you place Enemies next them, one must wonder what critics and audiences didn't get about the film. It was by far Johnny Depp finest dramatic turn of his career. This would be a role I would love to see Johnny at the podium receiving a gold man for. Marion Cotillard is much of the anchor of the picture as she is a beautiful presence, igniting the screen with every word, tear, and smile. Billy Crudup who takes on his role with much ease and makes it seem effortless (which is his downfall for this awards season I presume) takes on his minimal screen time and takes charge. The worst part of the film, unfortunately is Christian Bale who's flat acting and seemingly useless role (which might be the screenplay's fault) does nothing more for the picture than a 30's automobile.I expect big chances in editing, cinematography, acting nods for Depp and Cotillard, and a possible Best Picture nod for Public Enemies. Oscar take note, this is something of a revolutionary picture.***1/2/****",9,2,5,17 July 2009
The Danish Girl," Bravo to Eddie Redmayne and Alicia Vikander! Oscars are Coming!
","With the transgender movement heavily in the media with figures like Caitlyn Jenner, and countless others heading the conversation, a film like Tom Hooper's 'The Danish Girl' feels vibrantly relevant in today's cinematic climate. Spearheaded by two powerhouse performances from Academy Award winner Eddie Redmayne and Alicia Vikander, 'The Danish Girl' is a luscious and gorgeously crafted piece, invigorating the soul with its conveying message of freedom and love.As polarizing as Tom Hooper has been in his choices to shoot and frame his films like 'The King's Speech' and 'Les Miserables,' two films that are still delightfully poignant years after, 'The Danish Girl' is by far his most alluring film to date. Cinematographer Danny Cohen truly hits his stride from the opening frames, as he calls back to Dick Pope's work in last year's 'Mr. Turner,' but allows a story fragrantly moving to become his blank canvas in which to respectfully capture the film's most sentimental moments. If you're searching for the 'Hooper-isms' like people shoved into the corner of a scene or extreme close-ups, you'll find them, but there's a resourceful way in which he's utilizing his tactics that feel genuine and necessary.Last year Eddie Redmayne won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance in James Marsh's 'The Theory of Everything,' beating out some big names. A performance I quite liked but didn't fully understand the gravitation over other names throughout the year. As Lili Elbe, Redmayne ignites his most daring and captivating turn of his career. Visually married to the woman in dedication to the role, he allows 'Lili' to wash over him both with aggression and delicacy. It's a near masterpiece performance that I'll remember for years to come.Equally compelling, and even more magnificent in her turn is Alicia Vikander, who in just under two hours, solidifies herself as one of the most breathtaking and exciting actresses working today. Vikander's subtlety and interpretation of 'Gerda', is a sensational vessel of complexity and honesty, as she runs the gauntlet of a woman desperate to understand and struggling to hold it together. As the tears well up in her eyes, and she desperately asks Lili to have 'Einar' hold her, it's the single most heart wrenching scene this year. It's the strongest and most compulsory turn by an actress this year, and one that will have the Academy Awards running to check off for a nomination.The rest of the cast, in particular Amber Heard and Ben Whishaw is staggeringly good. Matthias Schoenaerts' massive and stoic persona adds to the mystery and complicated nature of Lili's existence.Where 'The Danish Girl' faults itself is with the script by Lucinda Coxen. While she successfully captures the spirit and tone of Lili's struggle through her life, her inserted beats of on-the-nose dialogue can be trying at times. Having Gerda say things like 'I felt like I was kissing myself' when recalling her and her husband's first kiss, was a little over-the-top in an attempt at foreshadowing. However, she delightfully captures the humble beginnings of their marriage, with the secret that plagues their union with accuracy.Just one year after winning his long overdue Oscar for scoring 'The Grand Budapest Hotel,' composer Alexandre Desplat synchronizes fervor and empathy with his brilliant orchestra. I believe its one of his most profound works to date. Same can be said for Production Designer Eve Stewart and Costume Designer Paco Delgado, who both capture the essence of European history with accuracy and vitality.'The Danish Girl' is a seducing feature with fortitude and grace, all of which measures up to heroic story of being yourself, no matter what the circumstances. Tom Hooper's direction, along with Redmayne and Vikander's work will likely be at the top of Oscar's to-do list for the awards season.",7,30,74,19 September 2015
127 Hours," Franco is the star, not the film
","Danny Boyle blazed on to the awards circuit two years ago with his Best Picture winner 'Slumdog Millionaire.' Boyle took no prisoners tearing through the awards season taking gold after gold. There was lots of anticipation for his follow up film '127 Hours,' based on the true story of Aron Ralston, a young man who gets his arm caught under a boulder in Utah. The premise and promise made it sound like a sure-fire winner. Unfortunately, the films falters and falls a bit flat in execution. Boyle walks a fine line between artistic choices and cinematic overkill; he crosses the line a time or two. What saves the film is the undeniable remarkable work of James Franco. This is the best solo principal casted work since Tom Hanks in 'Cast Away' back in 2000. What Franco achieves here is an uplifting of the human spirit and an utter submerge into a character of epic proportions.Though Danny Boyle's direction and Simon Beaufoy's script are not the brightest things the two has placed on the screen, the story itself is worth the admiration and enough to place itself on this year's 'must-see' list.***/***",6,5,11,5 December 2010
Superbad," Superbad is not too Super
","The overrated, over-directed, and overacted Superbad brings forth some shits and giggles but in no way compares to its predecessor The 40 Year Old Virgin. While the same humor is used, it lacks character emotion for the viewer to care, gross moments that are meant to be funny but dragged out four minutes too long, and an over abundance of bitching and moaning.The film tells the story of Seth (Jonah Hill) and Evan, (Michael Cera) two best friends who are in their senior year of high school who have their plans for being roommates in college ruined when Evan gets into Dartmouth and Seth does not. When both their high school crushes invite them to a party and ask them to get alcohol their quest begins. With freak occurrences and their dependence on Evan's annoying Dartmouth bound friend, Fogell they engage in one of the wildest nights of their lives.The grotesque humor as funny as it is, is used so much that the film overdoses like a drug user and loses its target audience. As it will relate to the young adult audience, it has potential to become a film icon like Old School and Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle. As you watch it more, the film may become funnier with each viewing. But I'm afraid the script is a little everywhere and the characters are ultra annoying to watch. Seth Rogan and Evan Goldberg had the right idea but try too hard like their boss, Judd Apatow who knows how to bring comedy and development together perfectly. The duo fail on almost every level.Grade: **/****",6,3,8,6 October 2007
Brokeback Mountain," BM plays all the right chords....
","Brokeback Mountain Ang Lee, the director of the masterpieces 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,' 'Sense and Sensibility,' and 'The Ice Storm' has really provided a powerful message to all who experience this wonderful film called Brokeback Mountain. But let me just stop there and tell you that I didn't love it like the rest of the world has been. The heart of the film is in its performances and direction by Lee. There have been rumors flying about stating that this is the greatest love story ever told and it has the power to transform the most conservative hearts. Well, as a liberal I will go on the notion that this isn't that great of a love story.We watch the progression of these two characters, Jack Twist and Ennis del Mar from two lost young adults whom find comfort in one another one summer and start down a path either of them could have expected. Ennis who is played stunningly by Heath Ledger is a man who is entirely reserved. Jack Twist who is played by the no less than perfect Jake Gyllenhaal is an extroverted charismatic individual who's looking for himself.These two young men just don't fall in love and that's it. The relationship starts off as a very lustful one with the only thing between them is attraction and sexual frustration. Up until the last twenty or so minutes of the film I never really feel the love between them. I might have been expecting too much out of the film and that's why I felt a little disappointed but its still impressive. The sheer bravery that Ang Lee has in making a film about homosexual cowboys in our very conservative day and age is striking. But let me say this To me, this film has nothing to do with homosexuality. The subject at hand is homosexuality but that is not what the film is about. Its about self-acceptance and courage. Trying to find a place in a world that has told you that you are wrong. We all make different choices when an obstacle is before us. Some of us choose to live or be in solitude, not talk to anyone whilst others keep themselves occupied. Most people want to face the problem face to face but are often reluctant to do so. This film gets the chip off your shoulder and makes you stop being afraid of who you were born to be. Fear is the enemy here not people. Love is the key to freedom and with that comes sacrifice and caution but with love at the center all falls into place. Okay, enough with the messages and themes and let's get on with the review of the film.This year's best picture race is totally wide open. Even though this film seems like the likely winner at this point, it just doesn't have that one thing that best picture winners are made of. What is it? Not sure at all at this point; the story tugs at your heart like previous winners (Million Dollar Baby, Forrest Gump) but this film moves very fast in its two hours and sixteen minutes. We span over 20 years in this time. That's a lot of ground to cover. Maybe that's where BM just went wrong. Lee should of just bite the bullet and make it three hours or so, I mean hey, those win best pictures too. (Braveheart, Titanic, Return of the King) Ledger as stated gives a stunning portrayal and I expect him to be a nominee this year. This subtle performance yet so strikingly moving is what gets people to the Oscars. Gyllenhaal whom is the heart and soul of the film will definitely make it to Oscar. When I was watching the film I suddenly got a vision of him standing at the podium accepting his supporting actor award but then I came to my senses and realized that won't happen with a snubbed man like Paul Giamatti around. Michelle Williams who plays Mrs. Alma del Mar has the right hand to play her way to March. The suffering wife is an academy favorite and you really feel for her character throughout the film. So that's three acting nominations you say, and that is correct. We will see BM in the picture, director, actor, supporting actor and actress, adapted screenplay and probably some more. This was a really good film and even though it may not win the top prize there is no denying the MVP of the film is Mr. Lee. After his loss to Soderbergh this will be his makeup Oscar for directing and he truly deserves it. He took us to a place no one would dare and made you feel for these men. I wish the depiction of love could have been better but it was there. Better late than never. The rest of the supporting cast is great with Anne Hathaway as Mrs. Twist who was a little miscast I might say. Anna Faris, Randy Quaid, and the very surprising and very powerful Linda Cardellini were great as well.Brokeback Mountain is a truly captivating and magnificent film. Despite the minor flaws in story, there's no denying the brilliance and courage this film has. There's a Brokeback Mountain for all of us and this film truly makes you want to find it.Grade: ***1/2/****",8,12,24,10 December 2005
Spotlight," Flat Out Remarkable! Possibly the Year's Best!
","Seconds after the credits for Tom McCarthy's 'Spotlight' roll, an overwhelming feeling of changing your career takes over. Is film criticism really where I belong? What important, life-changing story am I not writing about? Truth is, quite a bit of classic films give off that same feeling. 'Rocky' made a bunch of our fathers and older brothers go for a morning run and drink raw eggs. 'Rudy' made us want to go out and play Notre Dame football. 'Spotlight' makes you want to go down to your local courthouse and search the public records for clues. Then, get on the phone, with a pen and a pad, and start asking some really tough questions. Honestly speaking, 'Spotlight' is the best investigative news drama this century. Matter of fact, behind 'All the President's Men' and maybe 'The Insider,' it's among the best ever made.'Spotlight' tells the true story of how the Boston Globe uncovered the massive scandal of child molestation and cover-up within the local Catholic Archdiocese, shaking the entire Catholic Church to its core.Where you must begin, with any praise for the film, is the audacious and fortifying script by Tom McCarthy and Josh Singer. The two create cinematic magic in their articulation of words, characters, and narrative storytelling. Each person feels authentic. Each scene feels rich and equally important as the last. And most of all, its the tightest, most satisfying film from beginning to end, seen this year. From minute one, you're hooked, up until the last second, where they decide the last words spoken should be, 'Spotlight' is astonishingly crafted.I'm still in shock and awe that Tom McCarthy is the one who made this. This is a writer/director who I've appreciated but didn't have the 'love' factor surrounding any of his films. Paired with an outstanding cast, co-writer Josh Singer, editor Tom McArdle, cinematographer Masanobu Takayanagi and composer Howard Shore, Tom McCarthy gets a chance to create his masterpieceand succeeds. He makes brilliant artistic choices, such as letting a Mark Ruffalo letter reading play over a 2-minute taxi car ride back to the newspaper. McCarthy's direction is one of the best directorial efforts from any filmmaker this year thus far.All the players performing are top-notch but walking away, best-in- show, is the performance of Academy Award nominee Mark Ruffalo. Ruffalo exhibits his best screen performance to date, and makes a stake in his claim for the Oscar this year. Weirdly reminiscent of Joaquin Phoenix's work in 'The Master,' Ruffalo builds his 'Mike' from the feet up, giving him his own characteristics that I'm not sure McCarthy and Singer set out to do. His expressions in words, mannerisms, all encapsulate the magnitude of his work, bookended by an explosive scene that brought tears to my eyes. Think back to Emma Stone's acclaimed work in 'Birdman,' and the scene that made everyone notice. I wanted to simply applaud.Michael Keaton and Rachel McAdams, who play 'Robbie' and 'Sacha' respectively, are attune with their characters and destinations. Each bring strong sensibilities and sensitivity to their roles that desperately call for them. Hotly worked into the story is Liev Schreiber as a newly appointed Editor, that in the little screen time he's given, makes a long-lasting impression. Stanley Tucci is also afforded the same opportunity, and gives one of the film's best monologues.If there's a film this year that feels like an Oscar-winner, 'Spotlight' sure does make a compelling case. Dramatic, heart- pounding, and necessarily made. It's one of the most important films this year and probably THE BEST PICTURE OF THE YEAR. The Telluride tradition may continue.",10,279,453,19 September 2015
Juno," Do you have a crush on Juno?
","When's the last time do you remember laughing at a teacher putting a condom on a banana? Or a teenager peeing on a home pregnancy test? Or quote 'Thundercats a go!?' Diablo Cody writes her intimate character portrait Juno, starring Ellen Page in the title role as a young teenager who gets pregnant and decides to give it up to a family unable to have children.Thank You for Smoking's director Jason Reitman helms this ship of laughter, tenderness and Hamburger phones. The narrative is absolutely fantastic as it keeps the viewer engaged at all times but in essence, it's the hypnotizing dialogue from the screenplay by Diablo Cody that makes the film work so well.Ellen Page turns in one of the year's best performances as the young naïve and charming Juno MacGuff. She'll steal your heart with her wonderful one liners and equally break it with her character breakdowns and insecurities. Even though this has no measure to her Oscar snubbed performance in Hard Candy, this does hold some time of candle to it and is complete contention for an Oscar nomination. The role however, doesn't possess that extra mile to steamroll any other female performer this year. But its not only Page that makes the film succeed.Some of the supporting players turn some of their best performances of their careers. Michael Cera popularly known as the innocent 'Evan' from Superbad, plays Paulie Bleeker, the 'father-to-be-not' and gives a charming comedic performance. His role however doesn't require much out of him with the exception of tiny yellow shorts.Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner play Mark and Vanessa, the couple waiting for their chance at parenthood. This dynamic duo turn in the best performances of their careers. With layer upon layer of emotions these two actors possess, its amazing how they ever came to know them. Bateman's charisma and immaturity to say the least, fits well with the picture. His awkwardness is embodied quite well. Garner who tears at you from the inside out is so effective as Vanessa, the hopeful mother-to-be shows acting range which we have never seen from her before. Heartbroken, worried, and disenchanted engulf Vanessa which makes Garner sensational at her job.J.K. Simmons and Allison Janney play the lovable parents of Juno. As she tries to come to terms with her new pregnant lifestyle she spends time with her stepmother Bren, (Janney) the sarcastic, hard-nosed woman that is coming to terms with her new stepdaughter. Janney is lovable and utterly hilarious but its Simmons who is the stronger of the two and is more authentic in his character and traits. There is a good breakthrough performance lying in Olivia Thirlby as the 'teacher obsessed' best friend of Juno. She turns in a beautiful humane performance and encompasses the young teenager persona wonderfully.What are Juno's Oscar chances? To quote Tom Houseman as he told me after the film was over 'That is not Little Miss Sunshine.' Completely true and well said, it is not Little Miss Sunshine but it is a great picture, very reminiscent of past teenage icon films Fast Time at Ridgemont High and Weird Science. Diablo Cody is a definite threat for the Original Screenplay Oscar and Ellen Page is a strong contender for Best Actress. (I feel it'll be between her and Amy Adams for a spot) Best Picture isn't out of the question but it's rather small in a year full of big films and bigger stars. The film is a gem but I think expectations were too high and it fell a little short. But alas, I love Juno.Grade: ***½/****",9,4,11,8 December 2007
Concussion," Will Smith Steps Up to the Plate, Script Falters
","Read more @ The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com)An inspiring, academic by the name of Dr. Bennet Omalu takes on the titan of Sundays, the NFL, in order to prove a direct link from head trauma during football games to CTE, a football related injury that occurs. Writer/director Peter Landesman takes on the very detailed, and dramatic thriller 'Concussion,' with an insightful amount of control in direction, mostly thanks to Academy Award winning editor William Goldenberg, who keeps most of the film at a decent pace. However, with a clichéd script that brings the eye-rolling effect to a fever pitch, you can't help but wish that the material was more rendered and secure in its delivery. Surely to bring on an inner rage as we watch these men, so revered by Americans on a weekly basis, beg for absolution as they lose sight of themselves as time progresses. What doesn't work in 'Concussion's' favor is the glossing over the real human condition that is so desperately apparent in each frame the film attempts to show.Starring two-time Academy Award nominee Will Smith as Omalu, he delivers one of his strongest performances ever. An impeccable capture of a man from Africa, soulfully searching for acceptance in America, Smith brings a visible intensity in each line spoken. Settling into a role that calls for the best parts of Smith's charisma, which he has demonstrated effortlessly throughout his career, he handles it with an equally emotional heft that garners most of the film's best moments. This is a performance that deserves to be considered for the Academy Award for Best Actor.Landesman also constructs a decent cast with Alec Baldwin (not totally owning his own southern-ish accent in his exchanges), Gugu Mbatha- Raw (beautiful but utterly wasted in under developed scenes), and David Morse (who deserves much more roles and is quite effective in his limited screen time). Of all the supporting players, Albert Brooks delivers as the vulgar Dr. Cyril Wecht. It'll call back to his beloved turn in 'Drive' just a few years back (minus villainous murders). As a distracting entity, Luke Wilson cast as Roger Goodell is a poor choice by the filmmakers, serving nothing more as celebrity wallpaper.Composer James Newton Howard puts his horns on overload, sweeping into scenes that work well in films like 'The Village' but with a film such as 'Concussion,' it begins to grate on the ears at times.At 123 minutes, the film bloats like you over indulged at dinner time. In some bizarre, and almost 'too try hard' choices, Landesman attempts to focus on some of the more 'human' and 'natural' elements of Dr. Omalu's life. As we find ourselves more interested in the case at hand, the writer/director almost sets out to make his version of 'The Insider,' which would be fine if he got a better grasp on which elements he should focus on.'Concussion' isn't a complete failure, delivering at times with a grandiose turn from Will Smith. If anything, he's more than worth the admission ticket but I believe most of all, the film does successfully place a spotlight on an issue that is in desperate need of change. The final title cards will prove the NFL's power, and even deepen your frustration and anger. I think that it'll at least offer up a discussion point. That's success on its own.",6,35,69,11 November 2015
Crash," Best American Movie of the Year
","CrashAward Worthiness Best Picture Best Supporting Actor-Terrence Howard Best Supporting Actor-Michael Pena Best Supporting Actor-Matt Dillon Best Supporting Actor-Don Cheadle Best Supporting Actress-Sandra Bullock Best Supporting Actress-Thandie Newton Best Director-Paul Haggis Best Original Screenplay Best Sound Best Film EditingGrade: A *****/*****Crash is by far the most amazing, thought provoking, insightful film so far this year. The whole cast is top notch with top notch performances. Paul Haggis has created a masterpiece that I will remember for a long time. It brings you laughs, tears, and raises a lot of eyebrows. The 'Best in Show Male' has to be the amazing Matt Dillon who brings the character of a racist police officer with a dying father to life. Never before have I seen a more real, true performance. Sandra Bullock takes a break from her 'cutesy' girl roles for a some strong supporting performance. Her screen time is minimal but every time she is on screen you find yourself engulfed in her eyes. Terrence Howard is the breakout star of the year who carries many scenes on his bare shoulders. He shows you so many emotions with a tear falling down his face. Michael Pena is the most likable character of the movie and the one I sympathized with the most. He's too unknown to garner Oscar attention but we should be seeing him in the future. Don Cheadle gives a pretty decent performance but not as good as last years Hotel Rwanda. And last but certainly not least is Thandie Newton who's raw intensity gives the viewer a shutter. After last years bomb the Chronicles of Riddick she returns with a force to be reckoned with come Oscar time. I would love to see both Bullock and Newton nominated like McDormand and Hudson back in 2001 but that's very rare. The rest of the cast is great but it was just these few that stood out. Recommended as the great American film of the year.",10,4,10,29 May 2005
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," The Johnny Depp Show
","Welcome to the darkest and most morbid film of Tim Burton's career entitled Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. Starring Academy Award nominee Johnny Depp in the title role as the revenge seeking barber, wrongfully imprisoned and looking to settle the score with the man who put him there, Judge Turpin played by Alan Rickman.A side not before even diving into the review of the film; DreamWorks and Warner Bros. marketing department should be commended. As I sat in the theater with a lot of Johnny Depp fans, I heard many people say, 'this is a musical?' as soon as the opened with Jamie Campbell Bower singing. Even though the trailer does have Depp singing a few lines from his strong musical number 'Epiphany,' I don't think youths grasped the concept entirely, 'oh wow, this is a musical.' The reason I say this, the young men that followed these young girls were grumbling the entire time as each line was being sang. Morons.Back to the review: As stated before, Burton has created his darkest film of his career with lots of grotesque images and even darker set decorations and mood settings. Depp is as great as can be as Mr. Todd bringing great characterizations not yet seen before by the actor and surprisingly, a very good voice. Even though Sweeney is the one who is wronged, he makes some choices that don't agree with the viewer. You're pulling for Sweeney and feeling the tragedy for the character even though, you know you shouldn't be. That is Depp's greatest achievement from the character.Helena Bonham Carter as the Baker, Mrs. Lovett is great in energy and poise and brings a much needed humanity and sensitivity to this morbid tale especially with her scenes with the young Toby played by Edward Sanders. However, her singing leaves much to be desired and its her singing scenes with Depp we love because of Depp being in them.Sacha Baron Cohen in his brief appearance is adequate but with wardrobe distractions (those who've seen it know what I'm talking about) its hard to focus solely on his speech. Alan Rickman plays his villainous role as great as we've seen him before but weary of past performances in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves and Dogma. He is an actor yearning for awards consideration one day soon, but needing the right role to do it.The music as far as musicals go is fair, not the best of any I've seen but it does have some moments. The art direction, make-up and cinematography is the film's true beauty and the awards magnet that is needed. As far as the narrative goes, Johnny Depp is the man of the hour like anything else we've seen of him before.Grade: ***/****",7,2,4,26 December 2007
Closer," My favorite film of 2004
","CloserAward Worthiness: Best Picture Best Actor-Jude Law Best Actress-Julia Roberts Best Supporting Actor-Clive Owen Best Supporting Actress-Natalie Portman Best Adapted Screenplay Best Director-Mike Nichols Best Film EditingGrade: ACloser was my most anticipated film of the year, even more than 'The Passion of the Christ.' When watching it I really had no idea what to expect. I heard a lot about the dialogue but that was it. Wow, was I blown away. The film is the most insightful, thought provoking film of the year. If it were up to me this would definitely be nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars. Nichols has directed each actor to supreme perfection. I could not imagine no one else playing each character better than the ones at hand. The performances were top notch. Let start with Mr. Jude Law. I think he gave the weakest out of the bunch but still turned in an excellent performance. Even though you grow to hate his character with a passion he made you hate 'Dan.' Law gave great emotion and is definitely at the top of his game. Ms. Julia Roberts gave us a very different Julia Roberts. Her character is very selfish and Roberts portrays that with excellence. She was definitely one to watch and was quite enjoyable. She lifts her character to new dimensions. Even though Cate Blanchett was set to take that role I couldn't imagine Cate doing a better job than Julia. (No offense Cate, I still love ya) Natalie Portman has definitely made her transition from child star to adult star and with great ease. After watching her last year in Cold Mountain I knew there was great potential in her and I was proved right. Her sleek, sexy, and gut wrenching performance makes her a lock for a nomination come January. If she keeps going at this rate she will be a regular at awards ceremonies. And the last but certainly not least is the man of the hour, Clive Owen. He gives an amazing performance as Larry. He played Dan in the original London stage of this and made a drastic turn as a man with a little too much in his vocabulary. Owen delivers the best performance of the ensemble and will definitely be a force to be reckoned with in February. This movie was completely enjoyable and even though I wouldn't recommend bringing your Grandmother to see this, I will recommend it to the mature movie watcher. Best film of the year.10/10",10,1,2,14 January 2005
Shutter Island," The best thriller since 'The Silence of the Lambs'
","Martin Scorsese has done it again! He has crafted one of the best psychological thrillers to hit screens since The Silence of the Lambs. Shutter Island sizzles with pure excitement, tension, and powerful performances. Starring Academy Award Nominee Leonardo DiCaprio as Teddy Daniels, a Federal Marshall visiting Shutter Island in order to find an escaped patient, Rachel Salondo, who vanished without any trace. Along with his partner Chuck (Mark Ruffalo), the two uncover a web of lies and corruption that may have taken more a toll on them than initially expected.Shutter Island is one of the rare occurrences captured on film that I've seen in my lifetime, which could land its way into a cinematic classic in years to come. Scorsese has taken liberties and chances we haven't seen of him before and in this latter part of his career, he shows no sign of losing his touch. Teaming with writer Laeta Kalogridis to adapt this chilling novel by Dennis Lehane, Scorsese has set the bar for the rest of the films of 2010, and that bar is set extremely high. The film succeeds so masterfully thanks to three of Scorsese's crew. Cinematographer Robert Richardson shows the most beautiful camera work to grace the screen since Roger Deakins' The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. His artistic choices in shots institutes the most immense amount of tension and elegant work of his career. The great film editor Thelma Schoonmaker, one of Scorsese's great tools on his belt, shows once again, she is one of the best in business. She chops shots together as she was dicing up onions, never cracking under the pressure and keeping it all at a well constructed, sublime piece of art. The last pillar in the arrangement of the film is Composer Robbie Richardson, who goes back to the root of film encompassing the fierce brutality of Kalogridis' screenplay.Besides the heavy hitters of the picture behind the scenes, the performances of the cast are all top notch. DiCaprio has given one of his strongest works yet. He fights his way through the screen, taking no prisoners along the way and digging deep into a role where no sign of Leo is to be found. Ruffalo, definitely one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood nails his role. He strings us along with him, where the more we know, the more we don't want to let go. Ben Kingsley, as naturalistic and effortless as he can be, still proves he's one of the best working actors of the last generation. Kingsley as the mysterious and deviant Dr. Cawley, keeps us at arm's distance and doesn't let us in until it's under his own terms. Michelle Williams has her finest moments captured on film of her career. She's untouchable, intangible, and nearly unrecognizable as a haunting wife in the life of Teddy. Williams proves to be seconds away from becoming the biggest thing that Hollywood has to offer. Max Von Sydow and Emily Mortimer are both memorable and adequate in their respective roles. Even with the brief performances of Academy Award Nominees Patricia Clarkson and Jackie Earle Haley that blaze their way through the screen, they leave a massacre of audience members only wanting more.The question of the minds of many viewers is, should this film have been pushed back from its original October 2009 release and be in contention for next year's Oscar ceremony? I can't for the life of me think why this wouldn't be pushed as the big juggernaut of the studio's awards season. With the Academy Awards keeping the ten Best Picture nominees for the ceremony of 2011, this may be the first spot taken in the lineup before this year's ceremony hasn't even occurred. It's a brilliant piece of cinema, with the sheer tenacity and gumption to stand the tests of time as one of the best psychological pictures created in ages. Some may argue that's predictable, some may argue it wasn't 'scary'; like they thought it would be; it's a surprise view but one worthy of the highest praise.****/****",9,2,13,21 February 2010
Capote," The Truman Capote Exposition
","In his directorial debut, Bennett Miller brings the story of author Truman Capote and the fascinating events that led to his greatest written work, 'In Cold Blood.' Capote stars Philip Seymour Hoffman as the flamboyant author, Catherine Keener as 'To Kill a Mockingbird' author Harper Lee, and Clifton Collins, Jr. as the murderous killer Perry Smith.Miller does an admirable job bringing this intriguing story to life but it's Hoffman that makes his mark as the multi layered man torn between worlds. Hoffman shows Truman's vulnerability but at top has his tenacity and wit that made him such a star. But underneath all of that, Hoffman does the greatest impersonation of him and captures all the antics and mannerisms. With previous accomplished works in Magnolia, Almost Famous and Flawless, Hoffman finally lives up to his title 'greatest working actor of his generation.' Catherine Keener in her quiet performance is just that, a quiet performance with powerful words behind a soft voice. She acts like the strong willed mother that reprimands you when you've been a bad boy. But I'm afraid the viewer doesn't find the richness of her performance that critics found in the past Oscar season. I prefer her in the much underrated performance in The 40 Year Old Virgin.Speaking of underrated performances, Clifton Collins, Jr. gives the breakthrough performance of the year. His Perry Smith is smoldering, painful, and incredibly stunning in line delivery and poise. I couldn't imagine a more richer performance out of any other actor. After his introductory performances in Traffic and other subtle works, this shows the actor's range.The screenplay by Dan Futterman is the crowning work of this achievement as his scripted dialogue never falls flat and his character study his remarkably on point. It is Miller that executes his work amazingly and finds his Director nomination at the Oscars well received and deserved.Grade: ***½/****",8,1,1,24 November 2007
Life of Pi," Life of Pi is a visual spectacle, Irrfan Kahn's best
","There are a lot of positive and admirable things about Ang Lee's latest Life of Pi. Cinematographer Claudio Miranda captures the most uproarious and glorious shots captured this year thus far. The 3D effects are some of the best ever seen and feels absolutely necessary in a film so heavy handed with religious tones. What Mychael Danna achieves in Lee's film has just placed him in the forefront of great film composers working today. He continues to impress with his musical range, envelopes the film's message and thematic narrative in somber and beautiful melodic notes. On Visual Effects alone, Life of Pi will likely land a nomination for Best Picture. What Lee invents with the ocean and the integration of the tiger and the other animals is spectacular. He allows the mood of the film and the imagery to marry each other in a ceremonial experience that stands next to Sci-Fi epics like Avatar (2009) and Hugo (2011).Newcomer Suraj Sharma puts a valiant effort in the role of 'Pi,' a performance that may land him more critical and impressive roles in the future. The work is reminiscent of great breakthrough performers like Rudy Youngblood (Apocalypto, 2006) and Dev Patel (Slumdog Millionaire, 2008); both were impressive turns but sadly will not catch any awards attention. Irrfan Kahn, who has delivered in great supporting turns like The Namesake (2006) and A Mighty Heart (2007), could have his best chance ever for serious awards attention. His hurdle will be a minimal screen presence and a supporting actor race that's crowded with 'movie stars.' Lee directs the film with a firm hand. He knows what he wants to say and for the most part gets his message across. Unfortunately an unfocused and at times jumbled screenplay by the great David Magee creates an atmosphere that relies more on the visuals then the narrative. Also, I'm unfamiliar with the book by Yann Martel, never read it before, so I have nothing to compare it to but much of the story's elements of surprise feel rather cheap and ill-fitting. Not sure how it will play with others but the film remains pretty consistent on the entertainment sector. Lee explains his preparation for the film at the New York Film Festival with such passion and delight. He speaks about getting Sharma properly prepared by placing him on a boat in the middle of the ocean and meeting a real life shipwreck survivor; Lee's love for the project comes through, all four years in the making. It's a directorial achievement that the Director's branch of the Academy could easily get behind. The film lands solidly on the front door of awards season with ease and could rally a loyal legion of followers. Look out for the National Board of Review to kick it offI can almost put money on it.Read more reviews @ The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com)",7,132,236,28 September 2012
American Sniper," Bradley Cooper illustrates a new career high while Eastwood still stumbles in his latest...
","Read more @ Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com)Demonstrating competent war scenes, along with an astounding and near unrecognizable performance from two-time Academy Award nominee Bradley Cooper, Clint Eastwood's new film 'American Sniper' falters on storytelling and thematic developments. Continuously going back to the sacrifice that our military men and women make, which is perfectly fine, but beating the audience over the head with the sacrifice they make is something we've seen before. The tagline of the poster reads: 'the most lethal sniper in American history.' You'd expect to see a lot more sniping that led this man to becoming a 'legend,' which is what everyone calls him. The inner turmoil for a soldier is understood, but what more does Eastwood and scribe James Dean Hall have to say? Evidently, not much. If you're looking for a tribute to a soldier, than the film suffices. If you're looking for a good movie, then this oddly constructed, and often times uninteresting piece will leave you wanting more.Eastwood has taken on war films before with 'Flags of our Fathers' and 'Letters from Iwo Jima.' One of those is gorgeously constructed and moving. Eastwood is obviously pro-soldiers, as we should all be however, the film often rings false as Chris Kyle goes from cowboy, to enlistment, to watching the twin towers fall, and wanting nothing more than to continue to serve. Surely that can be the case in real life with the real Kyle, and this is no disrespect to his sacrifice and memory, but hardly anything that is presented on-screen feels authentic.Bradley Cooper has proved his worth for the past two years with work in 'Silver Linings Playbook' and 'American Hustle.' As Chris Kyle, this could be the best work Cooper has done yet. Unrecognizable and emulating the works of a Heath Ledger and/or Jeremy Renner, Cooper creates Kyle from the legs up, giving him beats that elevate the material. One scene in particular will rid any doubts that anyone has ever had as him as an actor. He's a marvelous wonder to behold.Sienna Miller is vastly wasted in a character that will go down as one of the worst of the year. The supportive wife equivalent of Jar Jar Binks, an overwhelming feeling of annoyance is present every time Miller shares the screen. Tom Stern's camera has finally been given a flash lens as we're finally able to decipher what's going on. A dust storm is expertly shot that helps create palpable tension. The best scene of the film. This is one of the Eastwood's strongest attempts at recapturing his magic from 'Million Dollar Baby' but he comes nowhere within its vicinity on quality. I'm unapologetically a person that didn't find 'Invictus' a catastrophe and that remains one of his better efforts as of late. 'American Sniper' will have its fans but Bradley Cooper is the only take away from the picture. That's a marvel to watch. Everything else, not so much.",5,45,110,2 December 2014
The Devil Wears Prada," It's Okay, Nothing Great
","The Devil Wears Prada How important is money and success? 'The Devil Wears Prada' examines that question at full force with some comedic angles and struggles to engulf the viewer in the tale but comes up short like a blurb of research from a magazine column. 'Prada' tells the story of Andrea, a naïve young woman wanting to be a journalist but ends up in the premier of the fashion world. Anne Hathaway portrays the ever-loving and innocent 'Andy' who walks into the high-maintenance, sky rise building of the famous 'Runway' magazine and lands the second-assistant position to the Editor-in-chief and starts her downward spiral into high heels, Gucci sweaters, and Coach Bags. It's there that she is tormented and verbally abused by many of her fellow co-workers and most of all by the editor of the illustrious publication, Miranda Priestly depicted by the great Meryl Streep.Andy finds herself being rudely ignored and spoken to from minute one. Through simple tasks to her 'Plain Jane' attire she is pitiful to all around her. As a solution to her constant anguish she decides to give into the world of trend, shape and style and finds herself moving closer to Miranda and farther from friends, family, and long time boyfriend. There is where the film flaws; it's too much like a recipe and less like an original blueprint to present with admiration. It's a Cinderella story with the same exact formula we've all seen before. The three standout performances are what keeps the story moving and provides us with care and pleasure.Stanley Tucci is truly an always dependable and reliable supporting player of film making. He is 'Nigel,' Miranda's right hand man and Andy's gateway into fashion expertise. Nigel is funny, witty and hugely charismatic. Tucci is definitely the character you could care the most about and gives the most natural performance of the cast but doesn't have that Oscar scene. Tucci's character is a bit flat in some areas and underdeveloped. Nonetheless, gives great mannerisms, fantastic quotes and exquisite chemistry with any of his co-stars. A scene about the character's background or sexuality could have sealed the deal for a nomination and unless the academy is feeling compelled to reward, which I think they aren't just yet, he'll be sitting out of the ceremony. He has one more film this year, 'Four Last Songs' which could revive and increase his buzz by year's end so we'll have just wait.Anne Hathaway is having a hell of time riding off some 'Brokeback Mountain' love to land her some solid leading female roles. She is the true lead of the film but there's nothing that screams Oscar about the role, it's just a solid effort to show us that she can act and is ready to leave her cutesy 'Diaries' girl behind. Andy is a highly enjoyable character to inhabit and completely likable. How can you not? She's completely vulnerable and completely lovable. Hathaway will probably be going for a Knightley-Portman kind of year and if 'Becoming Jane' is something great than she could find herself as the breakout star of the year like Terrence Howard last year. Andy's flaws and chink in her armor is where Hathaway truly shines. From putting on her first fashionable outfit to finding herself being relentlessly pursued by a business acquaintance, Andy is defenseless to the active world of media and glamour which leads to her character's downfall and inevitable rise up.And of course, who could forget the wonderful Meryl Streep. She is brilliant, bitchy, cruel, unkind and malicious. That's a lot for a character to expose and then suddenly surges into a character to mourn for, to feel for and feel completely sorry for. Streep is having a hell of year thus far and along with her 'A Prairie Home Companion' buzz she will undoubtedly land in the top 5 of the supporting category. Her Miranda is clearly a supporting role and it boggles my mind how people thought otherwise. This will hopefully be the year that Ms. Meryl will land her 14th and record breaking nomination but will most likely be for 'Prairie' and not 'Prada.' Her Yolanda is more Oscar bait and up Oscar's alley. Miranda has a lot to offer to cinema but not enough to go down in the books.The film has the a+b part of the equation but I was expecting a more capitalized 'C' and got the anticipated 'c.' The film starts to build the gigantic climax and just leaves us somewhere between premise and resolution. Even though disappointing in some aspects, the film is quite enjoyable and you could get a few laughs but don't expect miracles to happen and new ideas to be made. The rest of the supporting cast is good with some showing some range and some just showing. Emily Blunt is a great character to look and watch as the first assistant to Miranda. Enjoy the film and expect some Globe consideration and nominations but don't hold your breath to her a 'Prada' name or nom be called out on Oscar morning. It's all too cliché.Grade: **1/2/****",6,1,2,30 July 2006
Corpse Bride," The Least of Burton's Bunch
","PRE Oscars REVIEW: Okay, I'm not with consensus and I will say that Corpse Bride was not the great masterpiece I expected. Although I will say this.If Danny Elfman does not get an Oscar this year I will be boycotting the Oscars for five minutes. Those might be the worst five minutes of my life but it will be all about principle. Elfman's score and songs are mind blowing and save the film from being a bad Burton film.The thing that killed the film for me was the script. The dialogue was just a bit bland and boring. It couldn't keep my attention. My attention was restored when the clay-mation characters would break out into a song and dance. Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, and Emily Watson give their characters life respectively but the screenplay is just not fresh enough. Tim Burton's last effort at clay-animation was the no less than masterful 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' but sorry to let you down folks that this is no where near it. More than likely in March you will find 'Corpse Bride' in the Animated Feature category but not too sure what will happen after that. But I am almost positive that this will not follow the path of 'Finding Nemo' and 'The Incredibles' and grab a screenplay nod along with it.I still love Tim Burton with his eye and quirkiness of film but this might be near the bottom of his list of work. Sound Editing, Sound, Original Score, Original Song, and Best Animated Feature are the film's chances. Better luck next time Burton.",5,1,5,11 November 2006
Gone Baby Gone," Gone but Never Forgotten
","In his directorial debut, Ben Affleck has completely morphed himself into an emerging artist and even more challenging director. Gone Baby Gone might be the most innovative and moral challenging film of recent years. This is the story of young Amanda, a little girl who mysteriously disappears from her home and the activity and dangers that befall upon the people involved in her finding.The film stars Affleck's brother Casey as Patrick, in his most challenging and engrossing performance to date. Not since Sean Penn in Mystic River has a role been so subdued yet immensely victorious and depth defying in choice of delivery and spot on emotions. Casey Affleck has paved the way for himself in roles that demonstrate the actor's showcase and give the performer range. It's a bit odd what to make of the younger Affleck in the upcoming awards season. He fairs a better shot for his earlier raved performance in The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford for a nomination, but his performance in Gone Baby Gone is far more superior. Especially with upcoming prospects such as Daniel Day-Lewis, Johnny Depp and other big name talents, it'll be a tough road ahead for him.Ed Harris, who's been long 'overdue' for Oscar recognition is purely haunting in his role as Remy, a hard-nosed cop looking for young Amanda. In one scene in particular, Harris shines and gives his best portrayal since The Hours. Although his character is a bit one-dimensional, Harris elevates the material and turns it into his show and steals frame after frame in a role easily lost in a picture like this.Morgan Freeman, in a role we have not seen him in before, plays Captain Jack Doyle, the head of the missing persons unit with personal experience in the loss of a child. Freeman, although absent for most of the narrative, sugar coats the top acting talent in the picture. Freeman's agenda into more range projects in his older career is reaffirming his Oscar win in 2003 for Million Dollar Baby, but now with the more rewarding films worthy of consideration.Michelle Monaghan who's a bit of an unknown face, plays Angie, Patrick's significant other who's personal fears interfere with her involvement in the case. To be honest, Monaghan gets lost in the shuffle and while the audience empathizes with her throughout the latter of the film, she's placed into a role easily overshadowed by stronger characters. Perhaps being the only strong woman role would have gave us something to awe at, but not with the guns at full blaze at the hands of Amy Ryan.Ryan plays Amanda's mother Helene, definitely not the most likable of characters but tragic in character arc. It's like a full on tennis match going back and forth with Ryan and audience; the viewer is hating her one moment and then needing to hold her the next. Helene is multi-layered and grasps her own importance of parenting and the whole film it becomes a fallen angel lost in the fire. That is the tragedy of the film, a film not only about the loss of a little girl, but the loss of innocence and the torment that betrayal, guilt and corruption can weigh on our souls.Ben Affleck is completely in control of this film, which he has lacked in his performances often. He knows what the mission is of this picture and would gladly take a spot amongst some bigger, older talents among Oscar prospects this year. Along with Co-adapting the film with Aaron Stockard, if Oscar is feeling like inviting Affleck to the Kodak, the screenplay category seems like a better fit, especially with an already win for Good Will Hunting. Other possibilities for consideration is wonderful cinematography by John Toll and a great musical score by Harry Gregson-Williams.Comparisons to Mystic River are all about, being done by the same author how could we expect no less. Mystic River had more of the message of the domino effect of one's actions on others, Gone Baby Gone brings it to a new level. This film is about a society, a society who has lost the importance of innocence and the beauty of life. It focuses on the beauty of children and rest assure, when the film is over, if you're not yearning to be a better parent of embrace a child as a blessing, there is probably emptiness in your chest. This film is marvelous, beautiful and spectacular. A must-see film of the year and a pleasant surprise coming from Ben Affleck.Grade: ****/****",10,163,227,20 October 2007
American Hustle," 'Hustle' for the performances but little else...
","The stars seemed aligned for David O. Russell's highly anticipated American Hustle in which assembles some of Hollywood's most sought-after talent that includes Oscar-winners Christian Bale and Jennifer Lawrence along with Oscar-nominees Amy Adams, Bradley Cooper, and Jeremy Renner. He teams up with scribe Eric Singer, whose only feature writing credit is Tom Tykwer's The International, and based on the popularity of last year's Silver Linings Playbook, this was suppose to be Russell's masterpiece. Sad to report that the final product is an anti- metamorphosis of filmmaking that prohibits any consistency for the viewer to relish. What remains intact and palpable are the outstanding performances by the cast that Russell put together. All of them are dedicated to their roles, even when development and direction are lacking, and they truck through much of the narrative successfully.One of the largest areas of opportunities is the script composed by Singer and Russell. Despite scene-chewing performances from our principal actors, an absence of insight and cohesiveness, along with an irregularity of interesting dialogue plagues this once promising Oscar hopeful. In the first twenty minutes of the film's opening, I said to myself, 'this is going to be my favorite film of the year.' When the film ventures off into back stories and character origins, it plays like a parody of Paul Thomas Anderson's Boogie Nights, lacking any emotional connection. The film isn't overtly dreadful or horrendous by any stretch, just mostly disappointing. All the pieces are there, they just didn't take the time to make sure they all fit. It's confusing in tone, though very funny at times, especially coming from Cooper and Lawrence, but by the end, Russell feels he's warranted an emotional reaction from the audience when he's done anything but.Christian Bale is terrific, magnified in charisma while still keeping mostly all his ticks and mannerisms he's created for Irving in perspective. His work is also an impressive counterpoint to his other well-executed performance in Out of the Furnace. Bale proves once again that he's one of this generation's most gifted actors. Not only in the way he packs on the pounds, or rocks a comb-over better than any wannabe gangster I've encountered on the streets of Little Italy; he's the one performer that has a character that goes through an authentic evolution that's believable.As the spunky and crude wife of Irving, Jennifer Lawrence gets the biggest laughs and commands the most attention from the viewer. Better than she was in last year's overly praised turn in Silver Linings Playbook, for which she won the Oscar for Best Actress, this is a role that suits her well, both for her range as an actress and what she excels in with her fiery demeanor. I'm still a bit unsure about how old Rosalyn was suppose to be (that may be a fault of these directors thinking she's old enough to play these older women). Lawrence owns her role and has enough naughty sex-appeal and delivery to land herself an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress. I'd argue if she hadn't JUST won last year, she would be a formidable threat to win. Probably a more appropriate representation for her acting arsenal.I have fallen hard for the abilities of Bradley Cooper following his role as Pat in Russell's Playbook. Subsequently, the 38-year-old actor has sought dynamic and challenging roles that you can tell he finds exciting and prolific in its nature and candor. His turn in The Place Beyond the Pines earlier this year proved that notion and in American Hustle, Cooper is simply dazzling. Delivering the best performance of the cast, Cooper nails moment after moment, infusing his strict and intense line delivery while having impeccable comedic timing. One sequence in which he imitates the great Louie C.K., who plays one of Richie's frazzled superiors, engulfed the movie theater in non-stop laughter.The actor I feel the most for is the talented and beautiful Amy Adams. If the script was more developed on a writing level, this role could have been the performance of the year. Adams is given an opportunity to enrich herself in a woman, full of layers, that prevent her from losing sight of her own identity. However, being short-changed as her character builds, leaves the audience unsatisfied with where she ends. On a pure performance level, Adams is top-notch, conveying one of her strongest turns yet. I wished more for her but ultimately was let down.David O. Russell used to be able to excite, in the way that Quentin Tarantino would when ventured off into a new realm of his imagination. His 2010 film The Fighter was his most ambitious outing and I've waited, patiently mind you, to see when he top that endeavor. I'll always award his efforts as a writer. I Heart Huckabees, Three Kings, and Silver Linings Playbook succeed mostly on the merits of his storytelling ability. American Hustle levels out a lot of the time, enabling the viewer to connect and engage the world convincingly. There are other times though, where honestly, I almost fell asleep. Even when Russell demonstrates uneven filmmaking, I've remained bound to the story. This is the first time I found myself bored, especially in scenes involving Jeremy Renner, who I adore.Read more @ AwardsCircuit.com",Null,8,19,15 December 2013
The Bourne Ultimatum," Bourne is Reborn
","From acclaimed film director, Paul Greengrass comes the third installment in Jason Bourne series. Starring Academy Award winner Matt Damon and nominees David Strathairn, Joan Allen and Albert Finney. Great action with an even greater storyline make Bourne one of the most successful sequels in decades.Matt Damon brings a great sense of vengeance and humanity to his role and engages himself in a character even if he is incredibly reserved. What people tend to forget is that Damon is one of our most underrated and talented actors working in Hollywood today. Turning in great after great performances in The Talented Mr. Ripley, The Departed and Syriana, Damon is on his way to a future acting win to bookend his writing win. His 'Jason Bourne' is as complex as he is simple and gives us the range of an actor that the audience believes.Joan Allen is our most overdue, besides Julianne Moore, working actress today without an Oscar. While it isn't the Oscar bait role that every person dreams of, she brings that needed exuberance to a role and balances this film perfectly. Snubbed for The Upside of Anger, fans of Allen will wait for the role that will land at on a Kodak stage. However, her 'Pamela Landy' is quite an impressive performance nonetheless, and is a likable character that the viewer doesn't mind seeing on screen.Our supporting players David Strathairn and Albert Finney play their villainous roles effectively and exquisitely. We enjoy their on screen presence and look forward to future work from these veterans but there is no shining when Allen and Damon are this good.The screenplay by Tony Gilroy, Scott Burns, and George Nolfi is quick, engaging and intoxicating as it keeps the viewer enticed the entire time without giving us a breath. Adapting it from the series was an achievement especially when it's an action story, which can often take away from the storyline. They never lose that character depiction and development. Along with the direction by United 93's director Paul Greengrass with his lovely precision of directing and never losing site of source material, Greengrass is our next big directing icon for generations to come, if not there already.The Bourne Ultimatum is a great addition to a action, crime genre like Lethal Weapon, Die Hard and Casino Royale. Sound and Cinematography are feasible considerations for Oscar in the upcoming season but it is subtle and can be overshadowed and steamrolled by bigger projects. But audiences can easily enjoy this gem of cinema.Grade: ****/****",10,2,4,25 September 2007
Rush," 'Rush' does for Racing what 'Rocky' did for Boxing.
","There's been a lot of hype surrounding Academy Award winning director Ron Howard's newest venture into the world of Formula One racing starring Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Brühl. It's safe to report that 'Rush' from Universal Pictures is a thrill ride that will leave you entertained from moment one. Telling the dual stories of rival racers Niki Lauda (Brühl) and James Hunt (Hemsworth), two polar opposite personalities and their appreciations for the sport are put in the forefront by screenwriter Peter Morgan.Off the bat, one of the greatest takeaways from the picture is how confident Ron Howard has become as a director. He handles this sport and story with perfect execution, knowing exactly how he wanted to tell the story. He's never been as stylistically profound as he's been in this film. It's his best outing since 'Cinderella Man' - a film I found massively underrated in its awards year.The technical team assembled debuts some of their finest works in years. From the first frame, you immediately recognize the power and execution of the Sound team. Polarizing, loud, and engaging, nothing makes the film sing more than aural elements put together. DP and Oscar-winner Anthony Dod Mantle has finally found the right vehicle that not only showcases his unique style but takes liberties and chances that pay off in a big way. It's not easy filming a racing movie, in what feels like 48 frames per second, and have the audience catch everything you're doing along the way. Hans Zimmer is on a roll. After infusing his own style into Superman earlier this year with 'Man of Steel' and added tender qualities into the arsenal of '12 Years a Slave,' his work in 'Rush' is just as impressive and awards worthy for a Original Score mention. Film Editors Mike Hill and Dan P. Hanley cut the film brilliantly. There's a consistent pace that keeps you at the edge of your seat. The editing duo have delivered time and time again in works like 'Frost/Nixon' and their Oscar-winning works in 'Apollo 13.' This stands firmly next to those films.What helps the film move along are the impressive turns by Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Brühl. Two outstanding actors that haven't been given their chance yet to show what their made of in the film world, nail each of their characters beats and motivations that are completely lively. Hemsworth, who has been quite successful in the 'Thor' franchises and even dipped into the horror genre in 'The Cabin in the Woods,' has all the goods as a leading man. Fascinating and layered deep with a silence under the glitz and glamour, James Hunt was a lonely person. Hemsworth illustrates all of it with a light sensitivity and a charismatic nature.Brühl fully understands the mechanics and precise ways of Niki Lauda. The co-leading man is just as charismatic, even when he's unlikable, the character actor who has starred in 'Inglourious Basterds' and 'The Fifth Estate,' displays his abilities when given the opportunity to do so in his own film. Motivating and awkward, Brühl gets what Niki is all about. It's a remarkable turn from the Spanish-German actor.Two things happened when the credits started rolling. The first was I got in my car, which is an automatic Toyota Yaris, and attempted to down shift like a race car driver. 'Rush' does for Racing the way 'Rocky' did for Boxing. The second was a burned scene in my brain of a lonely James and an apprehensive Niki speaking by an airplane about what they did for each other. A scene that stands as one of the best of the year so far. Where Morgan falters in the middle with weird character rhythms and missed opportunities for a stronger foundation into their lives, he nails some instrumental scenes that makes the film succeed.Read More @ The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com)",7,4,6,17 September 2013
Burn After Reading," I have no idea...
","This movie is funny, actually very funny. Brad Pitt is amazing in his best comedic performance of his career. George Clooney is eccentric, quirky, all the things the Coen brothers make him usual which kind of works. Frances McDormand is cutesy and holds her own weight in a very testarone driven film. Richard Jenkins gives the most real performance of the film, showing real emotion and adding to his fantastic year in film.The story is all over the place and works for the most part but its really easy for anyone to hate this film and I did for a while. I just wish it was consistent enough to be great. This is a tough one. This is why it took me so long even to write a snippet review of it. I'm in the middle about it. It will appeal to some but not to many.**1/2/****",7,1,3,15 December 2008
Bridge of Spies," Just Solid, Classic Spielberg
","One of the most prolific directors in the history of cinema, Steven Spielberg, returns to the silver screen with his new period thriller 'Bridge of Spies' starring two-time Academy Award winner Tom Hanks. It features competent and solid filmmaking from its director, writers, and crafts team however, the film doesn't quite ignite passion and excitement from its standard storytelling. What really manages to standout is the impeccable and sensational performance of Emmy Award nominee Mark Rylance, who steals and owns every scene he's present.The film tells the story of James Donovan (Hanks), an American lawyer that is recruited by the CIA during the Cold War to help rescue a pilot (Austin Stowell) detained in the Soviet Union. It all begins with the discovery of a probable spy on our own soil Rudolf Abel (Rylance), who tests Donovan's profession and safety net.Academy Award winner Steven Spielberg brings many of his signature techniques to the spy tale. Tugging at the emotional heartstrings is an Olympic event at this juncture in his career, although not exactly hitting the mark the way it was intended. He frames his scenes with the same familiar authority that we've grown to love about Spielberg, and it definitely exceeds some of his lesser works like 'War Horse' and 'The Terminal.' What the film truly lacks is a daring approach to its source material. Unfamiliar with the story and real life individuals, Spielberg, and the writers, Joel & Ethan Coen and Matt Charman, don't enter the grit and horror of two countries at a feud, literally on the brink of a real devastating war.Tom Hanks brings his natural charisma and wit that we've loved about him for decades. His James Donovan is caring, engaging, and reminiscent of Atticus Finch in 'To Kill a Mockingbird.' His devotion to his family and the human condition is truly admirable, all clear and on display thanks to Hanks. As Rudolf Abel, Mark Rylance is just a joy to behold, filling in the gaps of the film's shortcomings with charm and seasoned acting ability. It's a brilliant turn by a brilliant actor. It's one of the year's best supporting turns and a contender for the Oscar statue.As James' wife Mary, Amy Ryan is relegated to just a few scenes but great nonetheless. Also brief are the works of Billy Magnussen and Alan Alda, who have good, solid one scenes to chew on.Technically the film does present qualms. Janusz Kaminski's camera work is distracting in parts, shining bright lights through windows, and keeping a one note camera style all throughout its 135 minute run time. Thomas Newman's score isn't put to its best use, as it swells in inopportune moments, even managing to overwhelm a key and fantastic scene by Rylance. Michael Kahn cuts the film to a bloated expansive run time but manages to keep you involved enough to make it through. The film really shines in its Production Design by Adam Stockhausen and its Costume work by Kasia Walicka-Maimone.'Bridge of Spies' may find lovers in mass audiences. What it does well is ignite a curiosity and power to look at the history of its subject. Spielberg succeeds at introducing the world to James Donovan and what else he contributed to society, along with the supporting players at hand. We do wish that a better, more dynamic treatment had hit the screens. From an awards standpoint, it's going to appeal to a great deal. Perhaps a second viewing will open up more possibilities.",7,11,26,5 October 2015
Little Miss Sunshine," Little Miss Sunshine
","Little Miss Sunshine The funniest film of the year is here with its dark humor and subtle undertones, first time writer Michael Arndt has created six people that in some way, you can find a bit of yourself in. The film is so crowd pleasing and hilariously funny that you can't help but want to be a part of this dysfunctional and at times inappropriate family. Each character is carrying their own baggage and personal flaws that make you sympathize and empathize with them. The head of the family, Richard, played by Greg Kinnear is a failed motivational speaker and invests a large sum of money into his 'Nine Step Program' to being a winner. He is at many times unlikable and completely uprooting. His ball and chain is the never disappointing Toni Collette who plays Sheryl, the backbone of the family who supports her children in every decision and dream they have. She is the true heart and soul of the family and empathetic in her thoughts and words. Next in the lineup is Grandpa rendered brilliantly by Alan Arkin. Grandpa is a rebellious older man who has developed a drug habit and gives many words of 'wisdom' to the family. We also meet the infamous and mysterious Dwayne whom has taken a vow of silence in order to achieve his next goal. He has dreams of joining the Air Force and flying a jet and gets many laughs through facial expressions and mannerisms. And lastly is the angelic and innocent, Olive; she's precious, guiltless, naïve, curious and exciting. She is one of the most notoriously beautiful characters in cinematic history. You fall in love with her and not only because of her 'cute as a button' persona but for her genuine love for life, dreams and most importantly her family.The true beauty of the film is in its simplicity because in that, you find all the vulnerability in each character and find an immaculate motion picture. The depth of the film can't be explained in words but in its experience and emotions that follow. Each aspect of the film is effortlessly practical but initially multifarious. This film is living proof that two minds are better than one because the two directors, Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris engaged themselves in each personality and technical quality. The cinematography is always soothing and utterly attractive. The time spent in the VW bus never feels like motion sickness and you feel like a passenger yourself just observing the lives unfold. The score of the film helps bring certain scenes to life and makes the movie that much more touching. The editing also goes with soft transitions and smooth operating.From the opening scene of dinner at the table you are locked up and don't dare to blink thanks to these actors. The performances are picture perfect and each actor offers something remarkable to their role respectively. Greg Kinnear's 'father-role' is definitely the least liked throughout the film but his character's transformation into a loose, loving father and wife is portrayed ideally thanks to Kinnear. He is without a doubt a lead and should be pushed in that category but unfortunately he doesn't have enough emotional depth to find his way to a top five. Globe consideration is needed and undeniably inevitable with the laughs he brings. The great and underrated Toni Collette is the backbone of the family and adds on another car to her train of terrific performances. She is also a co-lead and should also be pushed in that category. The Best Actress category has been weak for a few years running and this year seems no different except for Kate Winslet and maybe Ashley Judd and she can make her way into the finale and come back to a ceremony that she's been missed at for 7 years. Academy Award nominee Alan Arkin is hands down funniest player of the cast. Unfortunately his screen time is minimal but he is a veteran and if the Academy feels compelled to bring one to the ceremony he can be it. Grandpa is vulgar, comedic and completely smitten by his beautiful granddaughter Olive. He coaches Olive for the pageant and gives her pep talks that could bring the coldest heart to room temperature. Steve Carrel is the gay brother of Sheryl, Frank whom recently attempted to commit suicide because of job-loss, broken heart and social status deterioration. With his career going as greatly as it has he could find himself as the Thomas Haden Church of the year but with a better name. I could foresee both Carrel and Arkin both making it. Paul Dano is the most simple of the group and fortunately this will be the stepping stone for him to step off of into serious and thought-provoking roles. Dwayne is tortured, complex and witty and Dano shows it easily. The best in show honors is awarded to the beautiful and lovely Abigail Breslin can be this year's Freddie Highmore. She deserves many accolades but the Academy is extremely flakey with rewarding young child performers. Olive has all the things going for her to go to the Oscars. She has her scene of brilliance, her lovable persona, a pretty good resume of films and the best thing, she's adorable. The fact that she sticks out among these brilliant veteran, Oscar nominated performers is miraculous.'Little Miss Sunshine' could very well be the 'Sideways' of the year plowing its way into a best picture nomination along with realistic nominations for Arkin, Carrel and Breslin. I feel this film will be battling Guillermo Arriaga from 'Babel' and Emilio Estevez for 'Bobby' for the Original Screenplay award at the 2007 ceremony. I can't choose and I don't even want to think about it yet. 'Sunshine' brings much light into your heart and is without a doubt the most uplifting, feel-good movie of the year.Grade: ****/****",10,2,5,6 August 2006
Silver Linings Playbook," Bradley Cooper delivers the year's most surprising leading performance...
","The amount of heart and wit embodied in David O. Russell's Silver Linings Playbook is one of the tender and surprising films of the year. Russell, who has brought his quirky comedies to the screen like I Heart Huckabees (2004) seemingly never found his footing in the genre. Russell has had his fans championing his choices such as Spanking the Monkey (1994), Flirting with Disaster (1996), and especially Three Kings (1999). In Playbook, you can chalk it up to the source material by Matthew Quick, or the way Russell approaches telling the story but it's one of the director's bravest attempts to date. Despite a love story that feels forced and a bit tedious and predictable, the film is a breath of fresh air to the romantic comedy genre.Comically whimsical when it needs to be, the film searches and fines an emotional epicenter lying in the brilliance of Bradley Cooper and the rest of the stellar cast. Silver Linings Playbook tells the story of Pat Solitano Jr. (Cooper), a former teacher that attempts to reconnect after his ex-wife after spending several months in a mental institution. Living with his parents, Pat attempts to get in shape, focus, and reconcile relationships since his return until he meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a young mysterious girl with problems of her own. As Pat, Cooper shows a dynamic range of comedy and emotion that audiences never knew he had. It's a marvelous turn by the actor who has shown glimpses of greatness in The Hangover (2009) and earlier this year in The Words. While most of the film, Pat operates at a level ten, Cooper never overcooks and oversimplifies Pat's candor and honesty. It's one of the year's most surprising and delectable turns.Jennifer Lawrence's approach to the character is different than others. Tiffany lacks much of the likability factor that Pat or his family and friends do. Tiffany's antics, foul-mouthed liners, and over indulgence into Pat's life can be off-putting to some. It's still unclear whether the failure is on Lawrence's interpretation of the character or the structured laid out by writer/director Russell but the performance is merely satisfactory and doesn't stand out in a cast where everyone is producing career highs. I simply don't get the overwhelming love for the performance.As Pat Sr., the undiagnosed father who may have some ticks of his own Robert DeNiro, who has shown blips of excellence since his Oscar nomination for Cape Fear (1991), is back in full force; dramatic, sensitive, zealous about the work, and magnetic. It's inducing what DeNiro puts out for the audience to view moment after moment. As the overly loving and beautiful mother Dolores, Jacki Weaver practically spends the entire film on the edge of tears. Dolores, who is the exact opposite of Weaver's character Janine in Animal Kingdom (2010), embodies worry and nurturing effortlessly. In another surprising turn, Chris Tucker, mostly known for eyes and laughs in the Rush Hour films, completely floors me as Danny, the mentally-ill friend with his constant yearning to escape. Tucker shows a maturity we haven't seen before, even when he's hilarious. Julia Stiles as Tiffany's sister Veronica, Anupam Kher as Dr. Cliff, Pat's therapist and especially John Ortiz as Ronnie, Veronica's husband round out what is sure to be this year's winner of Cast Ensemble at the Screen Actors Guild Awards.The film also seems to have a more serious and political approach into the medicinal purposes in mental health rehabilitation. Is it about getting to the root of the issue and attempting to rid it or about drugging you so you don't have to face it? A daring question to ask as the comedy casts a shadow over this dramatic look into one man's approach. Silver Linings Playbook is a sure-fire hit with a loving sentiment and heartwarming laughs. In the end, if there's one hero of this team, Bradley Cooper is M.V.P. hands down and delivers one of the year's most exciting leading man turns. A must-see in 2012.Read More Reviews at The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com)",8,3,12,14 November 2012
Monsters vs. Aliens," Solid Animation
","The new animated film to grace the theaters this year, Monsters vs. Aliens is quite the enjoyable ride. Completely entertaining although not offering any depth in terms of characters, story, or themes, this is still a very good film. The voice talents are really on point with this one. Seth Rogan sticks out especially as the monster, B.O. B., the no-brain having misfit who steals your heart through the tale. Hugh Laurie, Reese Witherspoon, Rainn Wilson, and Will Arnett put forth their admirable voice works and shine. The 3-D effects were definitely outstanding. They took full advantage of it and showed the audience a very good time. The effects were better than Coraline's 3-D efforts but not as engaging with the story.Simply put, if you have little brothers or sisters, nieces or nephews, or just enjoy the occasional animated film, go check it out but enjoy the 3-D experience, its well worth it.***/****",7,1,2,2 April 2009
Dreamgirls," Dreamgirls is such a Dream....
","From Academy Award winning director, Bill Condon comes the adaptation of the Tony Award winning musical, Dreamgirls, that inspired a generation. The adaptation stars Grammy winner Beyonce Knowles, comedy stars Jamie Foxx and Eddie Murphy, and American Idol 3rd Season 7th place contestant Jennifer Hudson in her screen debut.The film tells the story of three diva wannabe's (Knowles, Hudson, Anika Noni Rose) and their rise to fame and decline of humanity. Bill Condon does the film much justice keeping the energy alive from beginning to end. Jamie Foxx plays 'Curtis Taylor' manager of the group who starts rattling the cage of friendship, vanity, and esteem. Foxx who since his Oscar winning role in Ray has been trying to take on more serious demanding roles and personally, it's hard for me to take him seriously as an actor. He is the weakest link of the cast but does a decent job with his villain character. His musical numbers do fall a bit flat on the emotional level and have no memorabilia for the viewer post-film.Beyonce Knowles completely surprises in her role of 'Deena Jones,' a pretty face but second in the talent department. Knowles brings a great humanity to her role and truly shines in the musical number 'Listen' which she co-wrote. While Knowles isn't at the top of some casting directors lists, she does have some talent and could become a serious actress in the future. While being campaigned as a lead performance for Oscars, she is undoubtedly supporting. Some could even go as far as call this an ensemble piece but the show and film is completely about 'The Dreams' lead/former lead singer 'Effie White' played amazingly and beautifully by Jennifer Hudson.Hudson engages herself in the role and while the role demands a great voice for her show-topping number 'And I'm Telling You,' the acting aspects never fall short. 'Effie' makes the viewer nervous in her angry rants, and sympathetic in her breakdown scenes. How can she be supporting when it's all about 'Effie?' I guess the Academy didn't want to deny her or Helen Mirren an Oscar, which I guess is fair.Eddie Murphy is still as funny and charming as ever and gives his best performance in years. While his 'Jimmy 'Thunder' Early' is completely rapturous and appraisable, Murphy sneaks up on the audience with a groundbreaking performance that shatters the viewer. We never knew Murphy had it in him. His screen chemistry with Anika Noni Rose is the great parts of the film for him especially with 'Lorell Loves Jimmy,' brief and simply powerful.The rest of the cast, Danny Glover, Keith Robinson, and Sharon Leal give good performances but all with very limited screen time. The champion of the film besides Hudson is Director, Bill Condon who finds such passion in this project. He is amazing in his choices of scenes and cinematography along with never leaving the source material and not copycatting.Dreamgirls is a sensational picture and wonderful musical-cinema experience. It's a dream come true indeed.Grade: ****/****",10,1,2,8 October 2007
The Men Who Stare at Goats," Goats and Clooney, Goats and Humor
","Grant Heslov, producer and co-writer of Good Night, and Good Luck has took a stab at a new satire type of comedy, The Men Who Stare at Goats. Starring Academy Award Winners George Clooney and Kevin Spacey, Academy Award Nominee Jeff Bridges, and Ewan McGregor this funny, although at times flat gem tries to take itself a bit too seriously. Heslov pokes fun at the military, which is funny, war, which is not so funny, and the stupidity of our leaders across the globe.The performances for the most part pull you though immensely and you rely on them solely for it to succeed. Ewan McGregor, snubbed big time for Moulin Rouge, is the best that he's been in years. His amusing gestures and screen chemistry with fellow co-star Clooney are some of the best parts of the film. His 'Bob Wilton,' a journalist searching for his life-altering moment for his cheating spouse, is sympathetic but doesn't require too much for him.Clooney is as funny as ever as 'Lyn Cassidy,' a man on a mission with a bit more problems than he likes to show. He shows the same type of humor seen in last year's Burn After Reading. Clooney seems to be having a big year ahead of him along with a (supposedly) star turn in Up in the Air and voice-work in Fantastic Mr. Fox. Clooney has hit a stride with his choices in films and is riding it wonderfully right now.Bridges, who beyond any comprehension remains without an Oscar, is delightful as any as 'Bill Django,' a hippie military general with a unique outlook on life. Despite his minimal screen time, not interacting too much with his fellow actors, this may help his campaign for his upcoming work Crazy Heart.Two-time Academy Award Winner Kevin Spacey shows his villain-like chops once again as 'Larry Hopper,' a relentless and jealous soldier looking to lead an operation of his own. Spacey doesn't go above and beyond anything we've seen of him lately but it's a solid turn for him nonetheless.The screenplay by Peter Straughan is nothing spectacular, at times the narrative takes sudden twist and turns that lose the viewer throughout. I'm not sure if it's trying to make a political statement or just vaguely make fun of it. However, Heslov and Straughan's film may not be for everyone and it seems everyone is exactly split on it. The Men Who Stare at Goats is hugely entertaining for wise-cracks and shock value, the true story part however, is up to you to decide.***/****",6,2,8,8 November 2009

","Jarhead I'll be the bearer of bad news and say that 'Jarhead' will most likely not make it to the Oscars at least in the Best Picture category. Even though I highly enjoyed the film I was a little disappointed in some aspects. With the exception of one really good scene Peter Sarsgaard, the two time snubbed for two years running, doesn't give a performance that would make the Academy think to give him a makeup nomination I was expecting him to be the standout of the film and felt a little disenchanted. Maybe a little more screen time would of sealed the deal for him but it didn't. He could make it if the Academy is feeling extra super bad for his snub which I think they aren't.Jamie Foxx is trying extra hard after his debacle of a win last year (I know, I know you're mouth probably dropped but I really felt he didn't deserve it.) to become a serious actor. He is very good in the film but there is nothing Oscar bait about the role. It sounds really good on paper but it just isn't impressive. I loved his character because he was amusing and made certain gestures that were utterly scene stealing but nothing is 'Oscary' about it.The true problem with this film is very poor character development. I'm not sure if it's the book's fault by Anthony Swafford or the adaptation from William Broyles, Jr. but I found it very difficult to fall in love or hate any of the characters. They were all just a mere surface visual and nothing that transcribed into a full fledged character that you could take with you home . It could nab a screenplay nod if the Academy likes the film but again I highly doubt it.Standout from the film was the very surprising Jake Gyllenhaal who I felt did the best he could with what he had. Gyllenhaal gave a stunning portrayal of a soldier during Desert Storm just looking for a purpose. Swofford tells the story of the marines not himself which is probably the reason for the poor character development. And by marines I mean marines in general not his platoon. Gyllenhaal is having a fantastic year and still has the baity Brokeback Mountain coming in December. Look out for a surprise double nomination at the Globes. I'm expecting great things from him in the coming years.'Jarhead' was a good experience but director Sam Mendes seems to be on a slow steady decline from his masterpiece 'American Beauty.' I see some technical categories coming up for 'Jarhead' with a small possibility for Sarsgaard for a makeup nomination but other than that it just wasn't the Oscar story that needed to be told. It seems this year is not shaping too well as we all hoped.Grade **1/2/****",Null,1,3,4 November 2005
Dallas Buyers Club," Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto achieve monumental success with their performances...
","In the front lines of transforming your physical appearance for the sake of the art, critics and audiences respond with gasps and eye-bulging at the shocking 'de-glamorization' of our beloved Hollywood figures . Often times, it's used as a gimmick, lacking skill and talent to match the transformation. Christian Bale received lots of press leading up to and following his performance in Brad Anderson's 'The Machinst' nearly a decade ago. Nothing about him or the film reached an epic proportion of legendary filmmaking or acting. Focus Features' upcoming film, 'Dallas Buyers Club' executes solid imagery and profound performances that stands as one of the year's most ambitious efforts thus far. You can't knock anyone for trying to go for it.Looking at what Matthew McConaughey achieves with the direction of Jean- Marc Vallée finally gives Hollywood and the rest of the world the realization of what an actor can do if they push themselves for the sake of the craft. It's not just a makeup trick, he embodies the soul of a broken man, reaching for a new-found purpose and demonstrating the human will to survive. McConaughey has hinted at this greatness for years now. He was in the realm of conversation last year as the lovable club owner in 'Magic Mike' and impressed the lights out of many earlier this year with 'Mud' from Jeff Nichols. Playing Ron Woodroof, a homophobic electrician that contracts HIV in the 1980's, the 43-year-old actor has tapped into an extraordinary and found humanity within a character that is often times unlikeable but continue to root for.Vallée's direction of the story is impressive. He takes artistic liberties we haven't seen him attempt before and does a comparable job at bringing the unfocused and at times, jumbled narrative to the screen. Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack pen the script from an honest place. The 'Inspired by true events' phrase that's plastered on the film's poster should have allowed a more cohesive and finely tuned story to be constructed. Their decisions on where to focus Woodroof's life during his first year living with HIV didn't give the film a thematic foundation to connect with. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to be watching a socially political film that highlights the intolerance of homosexuals in the 80's or a politically-motivated drama that highlights the injustices that our own government takes on its people. You can make the argument that it's a blend of the two, but the way the events unfold and are represented don't necessarily ring authentic. If anything, they paint a poorly constructed portrait of homosexuals and victims of HIV and AIDS during a very difficult time in our nation where anyone was looking for an outlet of longevity. We know lots about the traumas and prejudices of our victims during the AIDS epidemic and the battles they fought just to simply live. There's no other message or values that the film presents that I haven't already heard in 'And the Band Played On' and 'How to Survive a Plague.'DBC-02693-RAs aforementioned, the performances in the film rise above any flaws that the script may slip into. McConaughey is the best I've ever seen him. Simply a delight from head to toe, beginning to end. What I haven't started to uncover is the revelation that is Jared Leto as the lovable and AIDS-stricken Rayon. Leto, who has been away from the game for some time as he focused on his music with his band '30 Seconds to Mars' showcases one of the year's finest turns and the best he's ever delivered. Every time the talented Leto is on-screen, he steals focus from everyone around him. He manages to illuminate the pain and horror of the human spirit as it deals the inevitable notion that fairly soon, you will die. You won't see a more devastating turn or a greater example of masking the real emotions of the being this year. A Supporting Actor contender has emerged.DBC-00822-RThe beautiful and talented Jennifer Garner lays all she can into her role of Dr. Eve Saks, a doctor overseeing more than illnesses during the epidemic. While I will always remember her fondly in Jason Reitman's 'Juno' in 2007, she simply doesn't have enough to work with to rally anything more than mere sympathy. Two co-stars, who are always great to see as the expand the filmography, is Denis O'Hare and Steve Zahn, both impeccable in their minimal roles.As a whole, 'Dallas Buyers Club' is competent filmmaking executed by two outstanding performances by Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto. Director of Photography Yves Bélanger is the best of the technical merits of the film. Aesthetically capturing tender moments from the side of a bed and the window of a car. Something that should be considered when looking at the film for awards prospects. At the end of the day, it's solid filmmaking. You can admire the attempt, but it missed some opportunities. I think the Oscar race has just added two solid contenders on its already growing list who are completely worthy of holding statues on the night.",6,41,79,9 September 2013
Inside Out," In the Top-Tier of Pixar's Already Stunning List of Features
","The buzz has been huge for Pixar's latest venture about the mind of a little girl and the emotions that live within her. Writer/directors Pete Docter and Ronaldo del Carmen, along with co-scribes Meg LeFauve and Josh Cooley create a film with the most simple and authentic concept, and turns it into a methodical, moving, and layered story with so many different themes to indulge. Though there is a minor element to the film that leaves you a bit cold, 'Inside Out' is clearly successful in its approach and just about everything you want in a family film this time of year.'Inside Out' tells the story of Riley, an eleven-year-old girl whose family moves from Minnesota to San Francisco. In her mind live five real, and relatable feelings: Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Anger. When Joy and Sadness accidentally are thrown into the land of Riley's long-term memories, Riley undergoes a barrage of emotions that are affecting her relationships with family, friends, and the things she loves. Now, Joy and Sadness must get back to her core command in order to restore Riley's feelings and relationships.Teamed with the voice talents of Amy Poehler ( who plays 'Joy'), Phyllis Smith (who plays 'Sadness'), Bill Hader (who plays 'Fear'), Lewis Black (who plays 'Anger'), and Mindy Kaling (who plays 'Disgust'), Pixar's joyful and moving animated feature presents equal parts of humor and tears. A fascinating deconstruction of the mind of a child, and the changes they endure along the way. The subject matter is among Pixar's most ambitious and their most impressive since 'WALL-E.'What shines bright is the stunning animation on screen. A beautiful array of colors, just hypnotizing to the eyes as 'Joy' and 'Sadness' venture off into different parts of Riley's mind. I'd say this is definitely among Pixar's most alluring and aesthetically beautiful films they've ever created.As we've come to expect from an Oscar-winning composer like Michael Giacchino, the score for 'Inside Out' is subtly impeccable. Among his most reserved compositions, Giacchino takes a back seat to the story and lets the film do its work through imagery and narration.Presenting another key reason for a Voice Work Oscar to be created, both Poehler and Smith are downright magnificent in two of the year's finest performances. Poehler's Joy anchors the film with a glaze of sweetness, and when called upon, will break your heart with epic emotions. Smith's Sadness is a devastating but truly compelling creation, as she bridges our thoughts through tears and loss. Those two will be putting your tearducts to work and in overdrive in several moments. This is another shining example of a female-driven feature that is just as enjoyable, if not more, than any other male protagonist in films today. Film producers need to start taking notice of the slate of successes this year and what they need to do change the landscape.Where the film doesn't completely connect is in its supporting characters, in particular Anger and Disgust. With no fault going to the sensational voice work of Lewis Black and Mindy Kaling, the narrative creation of their place in the story doesn't seem to quite jive. 'Anger' is a simple emotion to portray, but I minor found inconsistencies in his character's actions that were noticeable. 'Disgust,' which probably would have been better off being called 'Sarcasm' just didn't seem like a core emotion that I think exists in the mind of an eleven year old girl. While I think 'Disgust' is something that the younger minds can easily understand, I think a different direction may have been needed for her inclusion. Other players like Bill Hader, Diane Lane (who plays Mom), and Kyle MacLachlan (who plays Dad) are strongly assembled. Special shout out to Kaitlyn Dias, who voices Riley, is vivaciously real in each delivery and each line.With no shortage of tears for the adults, and big laughs for the kids, 'Inside Out' fits firmly in the top-tier of Pixar's most vibrant pictures. An echo of love and vulnerability, the feature is gorgeously inventive and passionately executed. A fine selection for all to enjoy, no matter what age. Your frontrunner for the Animated Feature Oscar for 2015 has arrived.In addition, the Pixar short 'Lava' is stunningly delightful and powerfully engaging. Likely another contender for an Animated Short Academy Award.Read more @ The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com)",7,6,31,16 June 2015
No Country for Old Men," This Country is Rough
","Brothers Joel & Ethan Coen, the acclaimed filmmakers that brought us Fargo over ten years ago brings their most vicious film to date, No Country for Old Men. As the film evokes all the Coen brothers artistic qualities as their attention to detail and character study, the narrative disenchants the viewer on many levels.The performances hold the viewers attention, especially during the final forty minutes or so. Many questions are left unanswered and many issues left not addressed. Javier Bardem as the ferociously frightening Anton gives his most stunning performance of his career. As the psychopathic killer looking for his $2 million case, Bardem not shutters, loses focus, or disengages himself from us. As crazy and psychotic as Anton is, there is a hero in him that the audience just loves to hate. A great character study for the Coen brothers indeed.Josh Brolin as the eager and reserved Llewelyn Moss brings frustration to the viewer based on narrative choices but Brolin powers through and gives his tantalizing turn yet. He does capture the culture of South Texas and develops it into a full on human being. The sentiment we find in Llewelyn is in his relationship with his wife Carla, a beautiful naïve woman, blindly in love with her husband with some many agendas.Kelly MacDonald as the beautiful Carla brings a resemblance of Amy Adams in Junebug, and we know how that worked out for her. This dramatic turn as minimal as the screen time is makes a lasting impression on everyone. When you walk out the theater it's her and Bardem that you take with you. That naïve persona, 'twangy' accent, (we forget that she's Scottish) and that wonderful aura of curiosity and worried factors make it authentic to life.Tommy Lee Jones as the authoritative Sheriff Ed does an admirable job in his performance however, the first half of the film is the Bardem show which Jones can't overshadow at all. In the finale, the viewer is so frustrated by the story that I don't care that Jones is now bringing the humanity to his performance. The film was lively and authentic for me for the first hour and a half, after that, I started looking at my watch wondering when it was going to end. It does disappoint me that Jones' best work was placed in the weakest narrative points of the film. As people may feel different with that end, my intellect left the building at a point of aggravated feeling towards the things left unanswered. It was as if the Coen brothers started the film on pg. 34 of the novel and left out Chapters 12 and 14 to give us the full story.Consequently the film does work and has great achievements in cinematography and dialogue and is a threat in the upcoming awards race especially for Javier Bardem and Kelly MacDonald however, I can't foresee the Academy jumping on this for a Best Picture statue. This is so unlike Coens' brothers previous works but the detail and storytelling is pure Coen. A admirable turn for them despite the flaws.Grade: ***/****",7,5,13,24 November 2007
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Pitt assassinates the Oscar competition
","From writer/director Andrew Dominik comes the long titled and lengthy timed The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford starring Academy Award nominee Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck. The film in so much of its glory has both positive and negative components that make this an uneasy experience at the movies.Director Dominik has great control of the picture but when the film went into the editing room the film underwent some problems. The film never keeps the momentum to be an amazing picture. The viewer is connected for the first 15 minutes, then bored for 10, then enchanted for 45, bored for 15, then comes the anticipated climax and you think its over, then it goes on for another half hour. Dominik gives the audience the best understanding of Jesse James possible so we can become better acquainted with him but brings in an slew of different characters that, to be perfectly honest, I don't care that much about. I believe this might be a example of over character development where we get all the aspects of his life but all we want is Jesse.Last year, many critics were stating Brad Pitt gave his best performance ever in Babel however, his Jesse James is the best performance of his career by a mile. Pitt wears Jesse like an overgrown coat that you don't want to get rid of. Pitt gives the most tortured, endearing, and frightening performance of the year thus far. He makes the audience so uncomfortable and awkward yet gives off sensitivity and compassion for a very unlikable and ferocious man. If buzz builds, expect Pitt to be a huge contender at the Oscars.Casey Affleck, arguably the better actor of the Affleck clan gives the most pathetic, annoying and cowardly performance in the last ten years; and its brilliant. With his deep 'admiration' for Jesse, his Robert Ford is engulfed in Jesse's presence and wants enjoy the moments with him, even if he is in fear of him. The finale is truly his show as he stretches out his acting legs and dissolves into a character you can't wait to see off-screen.The cast ensemble is a true revelation as each character as over-developed as they might be, all bring a sense of humanity, charisma, and heartbreak to their roles. Sam Rockwell who is on the verge of being a household name and coming his way to a nomination one day plays Charley Ford, brother of Robert, as magnetic as the character demands. Mary Louise Parker, who is one of the better actress' working today, goes nowhere as Jesse's wife. This is a role that is very Academy friendly, and throws it away in a her limited screen time Sam Shepard who plays the older brother of Jesse, shows fear and anguish built up in a man who yearns for emotional freedom from crime. Paul Schneider, Jeremy Renner and Garret Dillahunt all turn in exceptional performances and enhance a cast of big name stars. Expect a possible Screen Actors Cast Ensemble nod for these men.Expect a possible and much deserved cinematography nomination for the overdue Roger Deakins, which is the strongest technical aspect of the picture. Also a great score by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis is a possibility along with great costumes by Patricia Norris and perfect art direction by Janice Blackey-Goodine. The appeal is there for the film as a whole but it leaves us floating a little too often in a long river of bravery, artistry and commendation. Dominik will likely be cited for some breakthrough director awards with the picture popping up during precursors' season.Get ready for the assassination everyone knows is coming but no one can prepare for. Never has been a film that tells you the entire story in the title and can still surprise the viewer with beautiful cinematic moments.Grade: ***/****",9,274,392,22 September 2007

Foxcatcher," Bennett Miller's latest is a building block of passion and tension with a righteous performance from Steve Carell...
","A film that takes its time presenting its case, Bennett Miller's wickedly brutal 'Foxcatcher' entices audiences to learn more about the questions around us, and where they could lead. Seated firmly in the center are a trio of dazzling performances from Channing Tatum, Steve Carell, and Mark Ruffalo, all of which make a compelling case for their career best works.Written by Oscar-nominee Dan Futterman and E. Max Frye, 'Foxcatcher' tells the story of Mark Schultz (Tatum), an Olympic wrestler who befriends billionaire John Du Pont (Carell) in the mid-1980's. Along with his brother Dave (Ruffalo) and his wife Nancy (Sienna Miller), that new relationship leads to unforeseen consequences.At the core of this morality tale is Bennett Miller, the Oscar- nominated director of 'Capote' and 'Moneyball.' He allows'Foxcatcher' to study its subjects, and give the audience an in-depth understanding of all the motives involved. With the help of Cinematographer Greig Fraser, and composer Rob Simonsen, the movie's melancholy atmosphere is truly compelling. Miller's brilliance isn't in things he chooses to show, but in the things he chooses not to. He draws out scenes that offer so much to the narrative. There's still so much left on the table that we do not know, which in itself, is perfectly acceptable. Life never gives us all the answers we seek. Miller, Futterman, and Frye understand this. Material like this calls to be made into a film. I'm so glad that these three answered the call.What Steve Carell achieves as John DuPont is not just a performance by a full embodiment. With strength and precision, he understands DuPont, a man with an extreme outlook on reality. Carell doesn't just ask us to sympathize with John, between his awkward behavior and his constant yearning to impress his family's legacy, he demands our understanding. If I didn't already know about the film for the past two years, I wouldn't have recognized him. His performance is completely focused and profound. Looking at the way he carries himself through the film, you are witnessing one of the purest creations of a character this year. When he's not on-screen, you're secretly wishing he was.When it comes to Channing Tatum, I have to admit that I never FULLY understood the appeal. Discovered the young ferocious actor in Dito Montiel's 'A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints' nearly a decade ago, and afterwards was only mildly entertained by his presence in films like '21 Jump Street' and 'Side Effects.' What he does in Miller's film is something beyond anything I could have ever thought he could do. Tatum doesn't just do an imitation, he channels the inner workings of a man desperate for more. His peculiarities are richly on display as he yearns for a father figure outside of the shadow of his more successful brother. He embraces the odd DuPont, against all logical instincts, but you can see exactly why he would feel so compelled to do so. Mark Ruffalo gives Dave the ticks and beats of an original creation. Picking at his beard (something I know all too well), constantly engaging in team leadership, and hugging his younger brother whose more of a son than anything. Ruffalo mounts himself on the perch of a loving brother just trying to create success for himself and his family. This is another solid outing for him. Co-star Vanessa Redgrave, as John's fragile mother, is marvelous in her short scenes while Sienna Miller adds a needed dynamic to understanding both Mark and Dave. The two women both offer compassion and balance.'Foxcatcher' is terrifying, disturbing, and utterly engaging. A slowly unraveled piece that is risky but pays off immensely. It's cautious yet strictly well-defined as a character study. Like all great films with great performances, its element of truth is plainly apparent. On the gray-skied farm, we will get to know three interesting men, some of which, we'll never truly understand.",8,71,117,11 October 2014
Gone Girl," David Fincher crafts a meticulous picture with a bravura performance from Rosamund Pike...
","Calculated, meticulous, and completely engaging, David Fincher tackles one of his freshest and stylish films of his career with the adaptation of Gillian Flynn's novel 'Gone Girl.' Intelligently structured by novelist Flynn herself, the film features a mannered turn by Academy Award winner Ben Affleck while the absolute success of the picture is indebted to the lavish and grandiose performance of Rosamund Pike. If you are unaware with the story, stay clear of any plot spoilers as possible. Obviously I always respect such a demand. Simply put, the film tells the story of Amy Dunne (Pike) who disappears from her home on the day of her fifth wedding anniversary to her husband Nick (Affleck).We have to applaud Gillian Flynn, a novelist turned screenwriter that composes a tense and mystery story that evokes a fascinating social commentary on marriage and media. A taut thriller, some of which may find bloated, but still satisfying by credits end. There are quibbles you can find in certain character motivations or certain events that lead to our ultimate resolution but it's not enough to ruin the experience. Flynn launches herself in the Oscar race for Best Adapted Screenplay with a very good chance of standing on stage this year.On one hand we have Ben Affleck, an actor of considerable talent that showcases another notch in his belt for his career. Reserved and orchestrated with impressive restraint, Affleck keeps the audience on the edge of their seats with audible suspicion. We've seen him in movies like 'Hollywoodland' and 'Argo,' both of which brought him great acclaim. This will likely be one that will follow suit.Unfortunately must admit that I discovered the beautiful Rosamund Pike in Lone Scherfig's 'An Education' over five years ago. Since then, I've only gotten glimpses in features like 'Made in Dagenham' and 'Jack Reacher.' A career topping turn as evolved in her newest work as Amy Dunne in 'Gone Girl.' I don't think I've seen a more complex female character that allows an actress to go places we haven't seen in quite some time. Pike is a revelation, an actress that should run the gauntlet for every Best Actress award in 2014. She's passionate, intense, and damn near impenetrable, taking risks that pay off for every single movie moment she's involved in. I absolutely loved her.You can't deny that meticulous and craftsman genius that is embedded within director David Fincher. 'The Social Network' and 'Se7en' have been prime examples of how to tell a well executed story. Stylistically, 'Gone Girl' offers nothing amazingly new for his repertoire. Director of Photography Jeff Cronenweth uses his same techniques that have made him one of the most exciting cinematographers of today. The real technical highlight is the score of Oscar-winners Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. Balanced, unsettling, and musically tense, the duo develop another stunning score for the year.The supporting cast all have high points, most notably the spunky Carrie Coon of HBO's 'The Leftovers.' Her quirk and ferocity stand up as an unforgettable highlight. Tyler Perry gives the world a terrific example of life outside 'Madea' and by God, I want some more. He steals many of his scenes shared with his co-stars. Neil Patrick Harris also delivers in his brief amount of screen time, one that will channel a new generation's Anthony Perkins. Kim Dickens, Casey Wilson, Patrick Fugit, and ESPECIALLY Missi Pyle make their marks accordingly. Don't be surprised to see the Screen Actors Guild cite this for Best Cast Ensemble.As a vehicle for awards players, the big chances will stand for Screenplay and Best Actress, both of which are win-worthy. In some ways, I feel Fincher has crafted his equivalent to Martin Scorsese's 'The Departed,' and obviously that worked out for very well for the overdue director. This is something that audiences will eat up, talk about at their water coolers, and probably revisit for years to come. It's hard to imagine how an awards member will see it but it will definitely appeal to many out there.'Gone Girl' is an undeniable winner. Haunting, unpredictable, and completely unforgettable, Fincher's film stands tall as one of the best things to be produced this year. Their might be similarities to 'Prisoners,' maybe even 'Psycho,' but 'Gone Girl' has enough going for itself to stand on its own.",7,29,73,26 September 2014
Django Unchained," Subpar Tarantino but Waltz and Washington shine!
","There's been no film more divisive or more igniting in terms of strong Oscar speculation then Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained. After months of shooting, word of a last minute edit (some believe editing is still going on currently), the film has finally hit cinematic eyes and the 'final' product is both bold and misguided. Django Unchained is big and full of Tarantino life and color that we've come to love about him. On sheer production value, it's his finest film endeavor to date. Set designs are simply gorgeous, Robert Richardson captures some beautiful shots, and Sharen Davis proves once again, she's one of the most awe- inspiring designers working today. Tarantino does go a bit 'out there' in his choices of dialogue along with the developing and rising structure of the story. Where Tarantino succeeds is in digging some terrific performances out of his principal cast, even if his film is at times lunky, problematic, and a bit messy.In the opening title sequence, Tarantino uses one of the best film theme songs this century and setting up 'Django' for an audacious roller coaster ride. The film tells the story of Django (Jamie Foxx) who with the help of his mentor Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) becomes a bounty hunter in the 1800s and sets out to save his slave wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) from the clutches of an evil plantation owner, Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio).Anyone who knows my cinematic mind, knows my feelings about Jamie Foxx and his abilities as an actor. For the most part of his career, I've found him immensely overrated, though excels quite well in comedic driven vehicles. As the uneducated yet craftly-minded Django, Foxx does one of his finest works. As satisfactory as Foxx is and given the nature in which the character is written, he gives Django a needed sensitivity that lacks in this grotesquely violent portrait. This isn't to say Foxx doesn't fault. His interpretation of Django at the beginning of our tale, fresh off the slavery line and later becoming an A-list free bounty hunter is not entirely on point. Not always being believable, at least in drama, is Foxx's major flaw. Where he'll start by burying himself into a character, by the end of the three-hour finale, Foxx's natural and Foxx-mannerisms reveal themselves in an awkward fashion.When Christoph Waltz came into our lives as Hans Landa in Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds (2009), many cinematic-lovers thought their lives would never be the same. Waltz's ticks, evil grin, and astounding portrayal went on to win, very deserving, the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. As Dr. King Schultz, Waltz recaptures much of that magic and demonstrates once again, he is one of the most talented actors to grace our land in quite sometime. What Waltz demonstrates so brilliantly is how he can both inhabit the soul of a man with no remorse or fear to take life yet have this potent and clear sensitivity for humanity. A divine interpretation. Waltz is fearless, becoming a man with no obvious background, and building one of the finest portrayals by an actor this year. Simply superb.In a near-mute performance, Kerry Washington, and make no mistake, is absolutely magnetic and steals focus from every single actor in every single frame. As Broomhilda Von Shaft, Washington delivers a performance reminiscent of Holly Hunter's Ada McGrath in Jane Campion's The Piano (1993), a turn Oscar recognized and is equal in talent and execution. Besides the obvious beauty Washington naturally exhibits, her heartbreaking and bravura work stands at the top of anything she's delivered in her respectable career. Though the work is brief, and in many ways a background ornament that some might miss, without it, the film and the fable would feel simply meaningless. Washington is purely fantastic.As the flamboyant and wicked Calvin Candie, Leonardo DiCaprio steps out of his usual comfort zone and is as charismatic as I've ever seen him. When Calvin is on an even keel, telling a story, and simply on his lower register, DiCaprio excels. It's when the work hits the high notes, over-the-top anger or forced fuming yells, it can often feel stale in its execution. One thing I've noticed is that Tarantino attempts to give DiCaprio, and the character Candie, instances of an 'evil monologue,' where the audience can find the brutality of his motivation spelled out on the screen for all to see. Tarantino attempted this in past films like Kill Bill Vol. 2 (2004) with David Carradine in the scene with the Bride and B.B. and the infamous story about the fishbowl. In most Tarantino films, this tactic works. In the newest effort, it doesn't come off as a natural disposition and simply out of character. The only conclusion I can come up with his either Tarantino doesn't fully understand his characters and/or their motivations, although he did create them, or simply the editing and the timeline didn't give him enough time to fully develop Django Unchained into the story he envisioned. With all this said, DiCaprio is still memorable and should be worth the conversation of any awards body.As the grumpy and vulgar Stephen, Samuel L. Jackson delivers his best work in years, reminding audiences that when teamed up with Quentin Tarantino, Jackson can stand next to any other actor working in the business. One of Tarantino's successes in the screenplay is the creation of Stephen, a head of house slave for Candie. Jackson is the comedic backbone of the film and steals focus from many of its performers including DiCaprio and Waltz. Also making a brief but memorable turn is the talented Don Johnson as Big Daddy Bennett, a slave owner that moonlights as something even more offensive. Making a cameo, Jonah Hill makes his mark and makes it well...Read the rest at The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com)",6,7,17,5 January 2013
Drive," Driving has never been this cool...
","In the briefest of moments, especially as the summer starts to slowly dwindle away from our eyes, the cinema theaters can offer rare moments of vividness and intensity. Not so often, a film will come through, set the screens ablaze, and become an instant classic for years to come; Drive is this year's film. Academy Award nominated actor Ryan Gosling portrays the principle character, a stunt driver for movies who moonlights as a getaway driver. 'Driver' as we will affectionately call Gosling's character, encapsulates the very being of a tortured soul with a heart of gold. What has lacked in our day of cinema that can leave much to be desired is simple character development. Not sure if it's the studios just going for a quick buck or if its writer/directors not giving the audience more credit than it deserves, but Drive remains both puzzling but equally satisfying in developing a character that shows nearly nothing and convinces us in a single moment like we've known him our entire lives. Nicolas Winding Refn, who jumped on the beat in 2008 for the British hit Bronson (2008), helms this film with precise and utter command. Refn's stylistic approach to directing is in the near top of films I've witnessed this new decade. His choices are luminous and sheer brilliant and stand next to the greats of Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola, and even Alfred Hitchcock. He lets scenes speak for themselves as he holds onto silence, shadows, and music like armor on top of a bullet proof vest. It's the most worthy turn of Oscar consideration I've seen this year. He covers all his bases and coaches Ryan Gosling into developing one of the greatest performances of his career yet. He's subtle, subdued, and nearly unavailable for us to engage with but he speaks volumes, yelps poignantly, and gives us a peep hole sized view into the real 'Driver. The adaptation from James Sallis' book written by Oscar nominated writer Hossein Amini (The Wings of the Dove, 1997) is pitch perfect in pace and while the narrative isn't as wrapped up as tightly as one would hope, it's still an impressive feat for any writer. While Drive is owned solely by Ryan Gosling, the film's ensemble turns in outstanding work particularly Academy Award nominees Carey Mulligan and Albert Brooks. Brooks brings in an almost 'can't recognize him' type performance as he completely loses himself and transforms into a vicious and terrifying character. He takes his dark side to a whole new level. Mulligan is sensuous and electrifying holding her own against Gosling. Bryan Cranston is charismatic as ever. Ron Perlman's idiosyncrasies and commitment to the character is some of his best work to date. Oscar Isaac delivers fiery magic in his brief screen time. Drive acts like an 80's movie that got raped by A Clockwork Orange and this was the result. It inhabits a wonderful narrative that may seem familiar but translated as a film haiku of sorts that by movie's end, you won't realize the ride you've just endured.",Null,4,9,29 September 2011
The Theory of Everything," Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones are a match made in heaven in James Marsh's biopic...
","Encompassing all the best parts of films like A Beautiful Mind by Ron Howard but creating its own signature and style to the biopic genre, James Marsh's gorgeous and beautifully compelling The Theory of Everything, the true story of Stephen and Jane Hawking, is a sensitive piece of filmmaking that stands as one of the finest movie efforts of the year. Starring Eddie Redmayne as Stephen and Felicity Jones as Jane, the two develop a masterful and sonorous dynamic that behaves as a naturalistic relationship that inhabits qualities of both love and sadness. They're a match made in heaven. Also acting as a morality tale, screenwriter Anthony McCarten puts forth intriguing questions regarding love in the shadow of someone's disability. Do you really know what is asked of you when you vow to love someone in sickness and in health? What happens when disability doesn't allow you to love the way you want? Are you better off just breaking free if you have the chance?The film acts as a moving oil painting. Benoît Delhomme shoots to utter perfection. Intimate in scenes requiring the viewer's undivided attention, and taking the liberty to capture the essence of the time where the innocence of love offers many possibilities. The scenes ultimately feel as if we're in a dream sequence, sleeping silently as these two lives play out in our minds.You don't get any tears or moving feelings without the bravura score of Jóhann Jóhannsson. Criminally overlooked last year in the grand scheme of things for his work on Prisoners, the composer orchestrates his best score of his career. Very likely not just my favorite score of the year so far but one of mine in the last few years. From the opening credits, Jóhannsson puts his stamp with heavy violins and beautiful piano playing. In the end credits, you can sit and marvel as the names cross the screen with the music that accompanies it.When it comes to biopics, people tend to automatically give credit to makeup and body language when talking about a performer. Past winners like Jamie Foxx in Ray have always felt empty as a performance but people were so tied in with the mannerisms that he brought to the role, which he often did in his stand up comedy routines. In Eddie Redmayne, we get a fully realized and tender performance. The first twenty minutes of the film, prior to the diagnosis of Hawking's disease, Redmayne utilizes all the quick wit and charm to show what his Stephen loved the most of his work and his woman. Obviously going through the physical transformation must be rewarded. Contorting his body and learning the physical tics that Stephen Hawking has displayed in real life all ring true. Since his breakout work in Les Miserables, a role that should have landed him a nomination for Best Supporting Actor, I was wary to believe I'd revisit a praising session with the young actor so soon. It's one of the best things offered this year.When it comes to Felicity Jones, the emotional backbone of the entire process has to be awarded to her. With stunning works in Like Crazy under her belt, Jones takes upon a daunting and heavily emotional character, never afraid to have the audience dislike or be disappointed in what she's doing. Marsh directs her to astonishing resolve. As a leading lady, Jones ignites such fiery and compelling questions not necessarily asked before in a biopic such as this. Complex and staggering in the way she decides to portray the brave Jane, Jones allows her character to grow, and both live and learn inside of her. What's most remarkable about Jones is she makes everything seem so effortless. She's not faking anything, she's really feeling and becoming Jane. She locates all the emotions required of her to execute successfully. It's a turn I wouldn't be surprised to see runaway with the Academy Award for Best Actress.The supporting players are no shortage of talent, though secondary to this type of story. Charlie Cox was just as good in his screen time. As Jonathan, Cox lays it all out on the table, heart on sleeve, and soul bared for all of us to see. David Thewlis, Emily Watson, and Simon McBurney are all solid but brief.Production Designer John Paul Kelly and Costume Designer Steven Noble should be commended for their meticulous craft in bringing the time period to the screen. An Oxford University dormitory along with a dozen outfits worn by all the characters can easily be taken for granted in a film like this.Screenwriter Anthony McCarten adapts his script from the book 'Travelling to Infinity: My life with Stephen' which was written by Jane Hawking. Audiences like their fair share of love stories, but some of them, rather most of them, don't like the ugly that goes with it. In real life, people make mistakes, and do things that can make some cringe. I believe some of the more questionable and controversial things during the Hawkings marriage was merely glossed over to not paint them negatively, even though the world is well aware of what went on. I'll be honest, I knew next to nothing about Stephen Hawking and his work prior to sitting for the movie. I knew the robot voice and that's where it about ended. If anything, the film inspires me to learn more about Stephen's work and theories presented. All of those things are definitely given a back seat to a film that doesn't really require them. The Theory of Everything is not about the equations or the mathematics. It's essentially about us. It's about love, and not just in the form of marriage. We as humans learn to love ourselves, our families, and our children. They are placed in our lives but I'm not sure how much we realize what goes into maintaining those relationships. The movie makes you think of those things.",7,135,170,10 September 2014
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," 'Walter Mitty' misfires on several cylinders...
","NEW YORK FILM FESTIVAL: The East Coast crowd was the first to finally get a look at Ben Stiller's long-awaited remake of 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty' in which he stars with Academy Award nominee Kristen Wiig and Academy Award winners Shirley MacLaine and Sean Penn. Expectations were high following a trailer that wowed many with its visual style and seemingly interesting premise. In the end, Stiller's take on the 1947 classic is rather bombastic and brings forth narrative clichés and messy executions. This isn't to say it's a complete misfire. There are definite and obvious positives to take away. The entire camera work by Stuart Dryburgh, most notable for his work on Jane Campion's 'The Piano' twenty years ago, is smoothly appealing with stunning shots for the audience to sink their teeth into. As the film travels throughout different parts of the world including Iceland and Greenland, two places that haven't been explored that much in film according to screenwriter Steve Conrad, are stunning. We have to give credit to director Stiller who knows how to frame his films exceedingly well. There are elements where he takes his cues from films like 'Stranger than Fiction' and 'Garden State.' At the press conference he mentioned watching 'The Apartment' with the cast in order to get a feel for what he wanted this sprawling epic to feel like. Unfortunately, 'Walter Mitty' doesn't resemble nor bring any of the feelings that the Oscar-winning Best Picture was able to achieve.Attempting to take Stiller on as a 'visionary' director seemed a bit far-fetched when his filmography have included the comedic greats like 'Tropic Thunder' and 'Reality Bites.' This is surely his most ambitious effort he's attempted. One thing is for sure, Stiller hasn't been this good in front of the camera in his entire career. While the narrative structure of 'Walter Mitty' is incredibly uneven and stereo typically constructed, Stiller puts some of his acting chops forward. It's good to see him in something like this. A Golden Globe nomination could definitely come his way. Steve Conrad's script is a jumbled farce, misfiring on comedic executions and inserting beats that have no real relevance to the story. A 'Benjamin Button' joke, though funny to watch, provides no purpose to our tale. I'm also tired of watching the 'nerdy office guy' transform himself into the cool and collected man by film's end. Note to filmmakers, just because your main character is in a shirt and tie at the beginning of the movie, you can't just let them grow a beard, put on a sweater and jeans, and suddenly the audience is supposed to believe he's this 'new person.' This movie is an epic fantasy tale about a man who daydreams about things that would be more outlandish than the real world. There's a false sense of reality when we're in the 'real world.' Jumping on a plane, suddenly flying across the world, and then receiving cell phone reception in the Himalayas is not exactly something that would happen in today's age.Kristen Wiig really tries, god bless her soul. Playing our love interest Cheryl, Wiig is a recently divorced, single mom who, for no real reason whatsoever, takes an interest in Walter's 'mystery' that he must solve. Wiig's 'moment' is unfortunately cut short by a directorial choice by Stiller. A scene of her playing guitar and singing the first few bars of 'Space Odyssey' by David Bowie builds up before being cut short by an insertion of the original number. Wasted. It did make me pop it in on my way home so I guess it's not a complete miss.Oscar winners Sean Penn and Shirley MacLaine are the best of the cast, using their veteran style and wits to make a wonderful and memorable impression. Same goes for Kathryn Hahn, who needs a great role in the near future. She's versatile in comedy as we've seen in 'Step Brothers' but she excels just as well in serious, heartbreaking turns like in 'Revolutionary Road.' She doesn't have much to offer our tale in this case. No fault of her own. Should also mention that Adam Scott from NBC's 'Park and Recreation' is probably one of the funniest villains of the year. His comedic timing is pretty spot on and continues to shine in sleazy, douchebag roles.Let's not forget that this tale builds up to a final image that is rather anti-climatic and much of a letdown. I can appreciate the respect and passion that Stiller has for the source material and more times than not, the film is entertaining. Mass audiences will probably fall for it in a big way especially around the holidays. From the looks of it, the film is going to be incredibly divisive. Some will love it, others will be disappointed. I unfortunately fall more towards the latter of that equation. 'Walter Mitty' is a decent time at the movie and is definitely in contention for several technical Oscars. Things like Production Design, Cinematography, and Visual Effects are possibilities.'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty' opens in theaters December 25.",6,46,98,5 October 2013
I Am Legend," Should of been called, Are you Serious?
","Francis Lawrence, the director of Constantine brings us the futuristic, science-fiction thriller I Am Legend starring Academy Award nominee Will Smith. Smith plays Dr. Robert Neville, a scientist living in a dissolute New York City trying to develop the cure to the virus that wiped out the entire world population and left him immune.There isn't much that can be said about the picture rather than Will Smith gives his most brave portrayal to date and places him as one of the most talented actors working today. As the film will gain much comparisons to Robert Zemeckis' Cast Away starring Tom Hanks, this film holds no measure. As Neville tries to develop this cure by day, at night he must flee and hide from something dark and demented hiding in the shadows. These 'creatures' are a little cheesy and even more corny as the special effects seem rushed and unrewarding.The first ¾ of the picture are engaging as we follow Smith around the jungle-like New York City and brought into flash backs of the end of days over three years ago. The ending is very sour in taste and unrealistic in actions. I have an imagination as much as the next person but some things just bother the viewer when we're watching an event unfold that seems witless.Consequently, it's Will Smith the is the revelation and fantastic to watch. He gives us range, humor, dramatic elements, and something to awe at. The storyline is interesting in concept but wrong choices are made in execution. It's definitely worth a watch.Grade: **1/2/****",6,1,4,23 December 2007
Kick-Ass," Kick Asses of Entertainment
","From Matthew Vaughn, director of Stardust and Layer Cake, the man takes a stab at the comic book genre, Kick-Ass. While the film bodes well for entertainment and the average Friday night visit to the movies, Kick-Ass doesn't offer any heart and soul to withstand any real social or film-making significance. Vaughn seems to be very inspired by Quentin Tarantino's film style but rather then use it as a foundation, he copies it in the most awkward way and delivers second rate results.With an ensemble of all up-and-comers, and Nicolas Cage, Kick-Ass enables its players to dig somewhat deep within themselves to bare real emotions, however, minimal delivery and story arch don't lead to any substantial moments. Of the players, Aaron Johnson who plays the brave superhero 'Kick-Ass' carries the audiences affection. With his breakthrough performance in Nowhere Boy last year, Johnson will sure to be one of Hollywood's bright lights.Chloe Moretz as the vulgar and spunky 'Hit-Girl' is surely a fan favorite character, however, I found her character completely annoying. Her fight sequences, as most of the film, are simply awesome and red hot fire, but as soon as dialogue is shared with any of her co-stars, worst of all Nicolas Cage as 'Big Daddy,' eyes roll. And what Nicolas Cage seems to be doing these days is stop trying altogether on acting. He's showing an eclectic taste in choosing movie roles which I can appreciate but he's lost all sight of what he showed us in the mid-90's when he won his Oscar for Leaving Las Vegas. He's stopped chasing that moment again.Christopher Mintz-Plasse, or as you may know him better as 'McLovin' from Superbad, remains his A-typical role with no acting range. As awesome as Mintz has been in his last roles, he seems to be locked in this type of 'struggling, teen depression angst' performances. I'm waiting on something more.As this looks like a negative review of Vaughn's film, my experience is not a bad one by any means. Kick-Ass is pure entertainment though a tad too long but it gets chuckles and smiles along the way. It shows something different which is worthy for a look.**1/2/****",6,1,10,26 April 2010
Gran Torino," Clint's still got it...
","In acting anyways. Clint Eastwood's directing on the other hand has become something to be desired in his latest effort. Gran Torino has all the qualities of a great film but honestly, horribly marketed as a drama which nearly is slim to none until the finale. Up until that time, its a near comedy. His performance is as rough and raspy as he can ever be.The supporting cast is great especially coming from the young Bee Vang and Ahney Her who completely hold their own against the veteran actor.His touch of blue camera work is there as his signature but his near ridiculous song at the end is poorly done and seemed like more of a gimmick than a piece of musical work.The film as a whole is nothing great, nothing terrible, just incredibly flat.**1/2/****",3,2,5,8 January 2009
The Hurt Locker," One of the best war films of the past 25 years...
","Gut-wrenching, pulse-pounding, out of this world tension, just mere exterior descriptions of what Kathryn Bigelow's new film, The Hurt Locker is. Written by Mark Boal, The Hurt Locker overflows with intensity, passion, and reverence. In the wake of 9/11, filmmakers have struggled to create a piece that is socially accepted and respected. Only two films have succeeded in this task over the past eight years; Paul Greengrass' beautiful United 93, depicting an open interpretation of the final moments of the doomed plane and now, Bigelow's film will join the short, elite list.This character-driven tale tells the stories of three army soldiers who are a part of the most dangerous of jobs to offer in the military, Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD), in plainer terms, they disarm bombs. Staff Sergeant William James played ferociously by Jeremy Renner heads up this story as a soldier facing death every moment of the day. With his wife and child at home and often displaying unorthodox behavior, James seems fit for a war soldier. Sergeant JT Sanborn, played by Anthony Mackie is a by-the-book man, living his days at war while incurring losses along the way. Specialist Owen Eldridge played by Brian Geraghty is young, bewildered, and thrust into a situation unknowing of the impact it would have. What these three men bring to their respective roles educates the viewer of the horrors of war. Forget what you think you know on CNN and your local news, Bigelow is running the show with Boal out on assignment and Renner, Mackie, and Geraghty as our anchors. The crews of the picture are the tools in building this powerful vessel. Cinematographer Barry Ackroyd uses his four camera use to keep us feeling like a first-person account of the events of the film. The mesh of Marco Beltrami & Buck Sanders score and the sound effects team makes for a more suspenseful experience. Filming in Jordan was the choice of Bigelow to give it a more authentic feel. 'If you're going to make a film about the Middle East, make it in the Middle East.' Bigelow said to me after the film. It paid off big time because I always felt like I was there in the battle zone, enduring pain, torment, and dehydration. With a NY & LA release set for Friday, June 26th, The Hurt Locker's deserves all the praise its been receiving and should be experienced by any movie lover. The Oscar Prospects might look a little grim based on the summer release but with no real first-half of 2009 contenders, Bigelow and her film have strong chances of taking a spot amongst the final five come end of the year. Renner and Mackie will also be strong contenders in their respective categories. The strongest possibility for an Oscar has to be for writer Mark Boal. The research he did for the film alone will keep Boal in the minds of voters. The Hurt Locker's striking cinematography, crisp editing that keeps it at a heart palpating pace, strong performances, directing, and writing is enough to take this film in consideration for your viewing. Brilliant, simply brilliant.****/****",10,115,214,27 June 2009
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," A curiosity indeed
","F. Scott Fitzgerald, one of the most innovative literary writers of all time, would have never thought that a brief short story about a man that ages backwards would become an ambitious effort from Se7en director, David Fincher. However, as fascinating as it seems, the implementation of The Curious Case of Benjamin Button wasn't as successful as one would have hoped. It presents itself as a Forrest Gump hopeful which surprisingly enough is written by the same man, Eric Roth.The film stars Brad Pitt in the title role as the curious Benjamin; at first, a young boy with no understanding of his condition or of his future and in the later years, an adventurous, inquisitive man dealing with the changing world and comprehending his love for his childhood friend Daisy played by Cate Blanchett.Fincher's direction is the strongest part of the picture. In control and understanding film-making, Fincher interacts and lives within his film as in his previous works, making his mark and showing his promise from his earlier years. Artistically the film plays like any romantic epic, however, more like a wannabe and never placing a firm hand on the subject matter. The makeup, which one would think to be a strong point, is very disappointing. Pitt, Blanchett, and Taraji P. Henson who plays Benjamin's surrogate mother, Queenie, all go through rapid and extensive age changes. Pitt at the age of 45 going for a 20 year-old looking boy is a bit far-fetched. But proud to say, with the exception of Pitt's performance as Jesse James last year, this is one of his strongest performances to date. Helming the character in the same manor Tom Hanks controlled 'Forrest,' Pitt holds his own in this tale even though the performance is subdued and doesn't demand too much of him emotionally.Blanchett is always good in anything she's in yet I didn't find her as appealing as I often do. Daisy goes through a lot of changes like 'Jenny' but unlike Jenny we don't feel for her character. She doesn't hold any emotional value to the viewer to help us engage in a relationship with Daisy. Blanchett doesn't represent herself the way I'd hope she would. Her beauty is as evident as I'd ever seen (especially in a dance belt) but as an older woman she's quite annoying and as a younger woman she's plain obnoxious. This is her weakest performance in years.Henson as the Sally Field-like character, Queenie, is equally affecting as Pitt is but her character is abruptly taken off screen and leaves the viewer disenchanted. The rest of the supporting players put forth valiant efforts especially Julia Ormond who's brief showing gives a needed poignant touch.Overall, Fincher's film is disappointing and with a 2 hour and 47 minute quest, there's a good film that could have been one hour shorter (literally). Oscar may come knocking on the door for Button and Fincher is probably in serious contention for the directing win but as a Best Picture winner, I can't seem to fathom the idea.***/****",7,1,2,27 December 2008
Transformers," Transform your life
","From Director Michael Bay comes the most visually spectacular film of the year. Transformers which takes the summer action movie to a whole new level. While the film is pictorial masterpiece, let it be known this is Michael Bay we're talking about here. There is cheesy dialogue with a quasi-stupid storyline but the entertainment aspect is there from start to finish.Transformers tells the story of Sam Witwicky (Shia LeBeouf), a teenage boy trying to cope and be accepted by his peers. His solution for acceptance comes when his father purchases Sam a car. Little does he know it's 'Bumble Bee' an Autobot from a distant universe sent to Earth to protect Sam and mankind. From beginning to end, there is non-stop action and we cannot wait for the next explosion.Shia LeBeouf is becoming our new 'it' boy especially with an earlier breakout this year, Disturbia. Besides being a heartthrob to girls, he is a brilliant up and coming actor. I would even go as far as call him the next Leonardo DiCaprio with his current pretty boy status and talent. He brings a great sense of energy and fun to his role.Megan Fox who plays Mikaela, Sam's love interest and brings the lovely sex-appeal and 'it' girl status to all the young and older boys who love to see a pretty girl get dirty. I'm afraid that Fox's acting talent is a bit limited and with comparisons to Angelina Jolie, that doesn't spell so much success for her either. I'll take her MAXIM cover shoot any day though.The rest of the cast gives us your fill in the places performances . We have John Turturro, Jon Voight, Anthony Anderson and Tyrese Gibson for all your comic relief, a little bit of drama and all in between. A well put together cast to say the least.'Oscar' will be pounding on the door for the Visual Effects and Sound teams. They are achievements in the history of cinema and completely revolutionized and set the bar extremely high for next year's of summer blockbusters. I'm very excited to see those teams up for Oscars in February and hopefully walk away with it.An IMAX theater, a big screen, the side of a building; one of these is needed to get the full experience that is Transformers.

Hidden Figures," 'Hidden Figures' Is Pure Goodness Featuring a Stellar Cast
","There's much to admire in Theodore Melfi's newest uplifting venture 'Hidden Figures.' His ability to tap into the human condition and spirit has been proved with efforts like 'St. Vincent.' Boasting an all-star cast that includes the talents of Taraji P. Henson, Janelle Monae and Octavia Spencer, the 20th Century Fox feature emerges as one of the feel good films of the holiday season. Just one year after #OscarSoWhite dominated the internet, pointing out the Academy's lack of diversity, the timely themes explored here resonate more than ever.'Hidden Figures' tells the story of a team of African-American women who provide NASA with important mathematical data needed to launch the program's first successful space missions.Melfi is a competent and distinguished filmmaker, and despite only two features under his belt, he really knows how to tell a story and tell it well. He invites the audience into the tale, allowing his sensibilities to take hold of the viewer. The top-notch direction in which he leads his actors are some of the finest of the year. Taraji P. Henson's Katherine Johnson, one of the brightest minds to ever walk through NASA, delivers her best film performance since 'Hustle & Flow.' She is finally given an opportunity to play something different than her ever-popular Cookie from FOX's 'Empire.' While she overplays her hand slightly in key moments, her natural charisma is on full display for the audience to behold.The professional and stoic presence of Octavia Spencer tends to be overlooked in film because she's always so great without even really trying. As Dorothy Vaughan, Spencer delivers some of her same ticks that won her an Academy Award for 'The Help' and that could be too familiar for some on the surface. When seen on multiple viewings, you can see Spencer's interpretation of her character really evolve throughout the film's runtime.The highlights of 'Hidden Figures' are in the two show-stopping performances of musical artist turned actress Janelle Monae and Academy Award winner Kevin Costner. Monae taps into the fight and spunk of Mary Jackson, showcasing the determination and frustration of a brilliant mind, desperate to finally explore her full academic and professional potential. While Monae's external beauty is front and center, she bares her soul to the viewer, virtually giving us a warm nuzzle and allowing us to get peeks into her sophisticated and heartbreaking aura.In recent years, Costner has found it difficult for audiences to remember how great of an actor he really is. We've received brief glimpses in films like 'The Upside of Anger,' but rest assured, Costner magnifies his abilities here, likely delivering his finest performance yet. His Al Harrison's leadership is a comfort for the film, acting like cinematic scissors to cut through the barrier between movie and person.The film is a major threat for the Cast Ensemble award at the upcoming Screen Actors Guild awards, with supporting players like Mahershala Ali (charming as ever), Jim Parsons (playing an against- type), Kirsten Dunst (feverishly addictive in her mean woman role), and Glen Powell (playing the late John Glenn) all crucial to the film's inevitable success.Brimming and refreshing, Melfi's technical team truly shines with slick production and costume design, and a soundtrack that is sure to go down as one of the year's best. Producer and songwriter Pharrell Williams' two numbers – 'I See Victory' and 'Runnin'' – are just two more examples of the Original Song Oscar being the most competitive in the history of the category. In terms of the film itself, it does the job and does it well. Not necessarily pushing the boundaries of filmmaking, it's just pleasant and wonderful in every sense of the word.Precisely marketed as terrific adult entertainment for the Christmas season, 'Hidden Figures' is a faithful and truly beautiful portrait of our country's consistent gloss over the racial tensions that have divided and continue to plague the fabric our existence. Lavishly engaging from start to finish, 'Hidden Figures' may be able to catch the most inopportune movie-goer off guard and cause them to fall for its undeniable and classic storytelling. The film is not to be missed.GRADE: (★★★½)",8,1,7,19 February 2017
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs," I want a Meatball...
","Based on the popular children's book Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, Sony Pictures takes a stab at the Pixar dominated world of CGI animation. Despite some flaws in the narrative, it's a solid hit for the company. With the voice talents of Bill Hader, Anna Faris, and James Caan, this light-hearted comedy is well worth the watch. Perhaps it's too light. There's no deep powerful message to be learned that you haven't heard before. It's very aesthetically pleasing as some of the other animated films this year. The land of ice cream scene was especially appetizing. And there is a terrific love story at the core of the film. Flint (Hader) and Sam (Faris) are the cutest of cute in terms of geeks in love. Directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller were very clever in the execution in the beauty of their relationship despite being based on the book.Is this the Oscar frontrunner for Animated Feature film? Absolutely not. With Up, Coraline, and Ponyo so far ahead of the game, the film is quite forgettable when placed amongst other contenders.

Children of Men," Where are the children?
","From Alfonso Cuaron comes the depth defying, Children of Men starring Academy Award nominees Clive Owen and Julianne Moore with Oscar winner Michael Caine. One generation from now, women are infertile and no longer able to do the one things they feel they were brought here to do. The world is in turmoil, streets are dangerous, and there is no hope for future. When the youngest person on earth is killed at the age of 19, the downward spiral that mankind is going down only worsens.All seems lost, until Theo (Owen) is contacted by his ex-wife (Moore) and presents him with a mission; transport a young African-American girl to an undisclosed location. There is a catch however, this young woman is pregnant and near birth.Children of Men is a captivating motion picture of recent years. As we expect this spectacular sci-fi film with explosions and action, we are left without the theatrics and given a humane look into the soul of a society. The film excels on many levels, especially in the film's resolution. Clive Owen gives a very subtle yet striking performance. We haven't seen Owen like this before and it's in the beauty of Theo that he creates that makes the character work. Not since Closer has he been this sensational.Julianne Moore is brief but very memorable. It still haunts me how that woman is without an Oscar. As underdeveloped as the relationship between her and Theo is, there's no real reason for us not care for the two. It isn't until her absence from the film, do we feel her prescience missed.Michael Caine is as effective as always turning in one great supporting performance after another. Caine is clear cut, fun loving and physically different in his role. The character doesn't excel on the dramatic level rather balances out the melancholy nature of the film with some bright faces and wonderful laughter.Alfonso Cuaron however, is the main reason this picture succeeded so. His choice of location, placement, and artistic integrity is evident from start to finish. The film's cinematography is the most creative camera-work in possibly the last century of cinema. Its such a key element to the story and the whole beauty and technique by Emanuel Lubeski leaves him in the top ranks of other great cinematographers as Rodrigo Prieto and Conrad L. Hall.This is a film for everyone to experience and with a good adaptation from Cuaron and four other creative writers, the film doesn't lose focus of their objective.Grade: ***/****",8,1,12,20 October 2007
Million Dollar Baby," Million Dollar Baby (Top notch)
","First let's start with the undeniable respect for Mr. Clint Eastwood. Producing, directing, and starring in a film is a lot on anyone's plate but Eastwood shows effortless masterwork. Clint Eastwood gives the performance of his career even better than his other Oscar nominated performance in 'Unforgiven.' His voice hasn't been raspier and we've never seen him so bare in character. His scene that proves the worthiness of the performance is his scene when he's in the church crying. There's no performance in 2004 that shows more nakedness and more emotion than that of Eastwood's. Hilary Swank also gives a performance worth remembering. Her character of Maggie is entirely lovable and believable at all times throughout the film. You love her from the very second you get your eyes on her. The real triumph of her performance is the entire last 1/3 of the film. From the moment of her being paralyzed you feel every bit of pain she feels and every tear she sheds you shed with her. She completely embodied herself into the character. Despite the breathtaking performance I still wouldn't give her the Oscar for the 2nd time. The nomination nonetheless was very well deserved. Morgan Freeman was one of the most overdue actors working today prior to 'Million Dollar Baby.' The performance was very good but not one of his best. His win was a celebration of all his fantastic films that went unnoticed by the Academy. (The Shawshank Redemption, Driving Miss Daisy, Street Smart) He is a very talented man showing many ranges in his impressive career from drama to comedy and back to drama again. You can't help but love 'Scrap.' Every line Freeman delivers in the film either gets a laugh or just utterly scene stealing from his co-stars Eastwood and Swank. If it wasn't for his overdue status going into the Oscars I wouldn't of gave him the Oscar. If were going on solely performance Clive Owen from 'Closer' definitely out-did him. Nonetheless Freeman's impressive career made him the prime candidate of winning his long overdue Oscar. Clint Eastwood directs this film to utter perfection. Its dark lighting gave the exact mood of each scene and beautiful musical score is remarkable. He is truly one of the most gifted people in Hollywood. One underrated performance of the film goes to Jay Baruchel who plays Danger Barch, the wannabe boxer. His character is like the others likable and I feel he was the true breakthrough of the film just like Thomas Guiry was last year in Eastwood's nominated 'Mystic River.' 'Million Dollar Baby was a pleasant experience and if it doesn't beat on your heart's door than there's no heart in there at all.

Garden State," I wish Largeman was my brother...
","TV Star Zach Braff of the hit show 'Scrubs,' writes, directs and stars in the comedic and poignant Garden State.The film tells the story of Andrew Largeman, (Braff) a twenty something man living in Los Angeles as a working actor. When he receives a call from his estranged father that his mother as passed away, Largeman must travel back to the place he left nine years ago and never looked back, New Jersey.This is the most personal and revealing work by any actor turned writer-director in the new millennium thus far. Braff doesn't shoot this film as a gimmick to his friends at home but takes on this task with high levels of respect and dignity. Braff shows how multi-talented he really is from the always engaging dialogue to the semi-pro eye catching director's skill. And if writing and directing weren't impressive enough, Braff turns in one of the best performances by any actor of 2004. Completely mind-shattering and completely awards worthy. Braff is the revelation of Garden State by far.But with all the praise going to his performance, the director sure did make sure to get top notch work out of his supporting cast. Natalie Portman as the lovable and pathological liar Sam is the beauty of any heroin to any man. Portman shows great esteem and the natural essence of a Jersey girl. Peter Sarsgaard who broke out on the scene in Shattered Glass, has such an uncomfortable scene presence but nearly knocks it out of the park every time. Ian Holm, the acting legend of the 80's and 90's, plays Largeman's father. As his tough demeanor progresses, we see how much of an icon Holm actually is. Breaking into mainstream cinema has never been his forte, unless you bring it back to Chariots of Fire, but as a fine wine that gets better with age, Holm is an acting master class.The inclusion of music in the film with great bands and Jersey-style aura has the viewer in awe. The soundtrack is one of the best film soundtracks of all time, if you dig this style of music. The ending credit song places icing on the cake of this film. Listen to Frou Frou's 'Let Go' and try to watch this film without feeling like the whole film as been encompassed in three verses and a chorus.Garden State is the best independent picture of 2004 that every Suburban, Jersey kid should experience.Grade: ****/****",10,1,2,1 November 2007
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," A Star is Born...
","In one of the most pleasant surprises to grace the screens in 2010, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (or if you prefer, Män som hatar kvinnor) is one of the best films of the year so far. Director Niels Arden Oplev has placed a stamp on foreign and independent cinema in a big way that I haven't seen since Fernando Mierelles blazed the screens with City of God. Oplev's Swedish-language film, based on the popular book series by the late Stieg Larsson, and adapted for the screen by Nikolaj Arcel & Rasmus Heisterberg, tells the story of a journalist and a female computer hacker, who's paths cross in order to solve a 40-year old missing person case within a powerful and corrupt family, where no one trusts no one. The film is such a terrific and smart thriller, encapsulating all the great things about the mystery genre into one tightly wrapped cinematic experience.One of the most spectacular things to come out of the film is the breakthrough and stellar performance of newcomer Noomi Rapace, who sizzles in her role as 'Lisbeth Salander,' the guarded yet vulnerable computer genius, who finds herself drawn to the honorable 'Mikael Blomkvist' played tenderly by Mihcael Nyqvist. Rapace bares her soul in the complex Lisbeth, which allows her to keep the audience at a distance, never allowing us near unless she gives permission. It's a rare experience in film to feel so distant from a character yet yearn and fight to be close and understand them, that's the achievement of Rapace's performance.Nyqvist is the film's Knight in shining armor, trusting himself to the character and laying it down so effortlessly. He gains the trust and admiration of the audience early on and sustains it for the long runtime of 2 hours and 34 minutes. The rest of the cast, all turn in superb and fierce performances from the grotesque family members to the heinous and evil parole guardian, you will find yourself on a emotional roller-coaster.What the film does is set the pace and the excitement for the future adaptations of the series, The Girl Who Played with Fire, and The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest, all slated for releases in the next year. Hopefully with its very independent and limited release, a honorable movie-goer can experience the new generation of mystery films standing next to the greatness of Alfred Hitchcock's infamous thrillers in his career. Oplev and his writing team reinvent the genre and raise it to new levels.***½/****",8,5,10,23 March 2010
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," 'Good Night' is really Good
","PRE Oscars REVIEW: This is the most important film I have seen this year by far. Never have I seen a story so masterfully told and focuses solely on the issue and not around the irrelevant events that surround the issues. The true light to the film is George Clooney's beautiful direction of the story of Edward R. Murrow. Clooney truly has as an eye for film-making and he certainly stretches out his legs here and shows some true talent. Clooney has the ability to go the way of Mel Gibson, Kevin Costner, and Clint Eastwood and make his way to the shortlist for his very intelligent writing, his beloved acting and masterful directing. He may find his way more likely in directing and writing than his acting. Clooney played Fred Friendly great but it definitely wasn't one of the best of the year. Better luck with 'Syriana' if he wants to get in for acting.The screenplay for GN & GL was so intelligent that it kept you intrigued the entire time. Not only is the movie very good but it speaks directly to us and by us I mean Americans today about many issues that we choose to forget about. Along with Grant Heslov, the co-writer with Clooney they have a real shot at some gold here. It is pretty much already known that 'Crash' is the early frontrunner and favorite for the original screenplay win but this will give it a run for the money David Strathairn gives a mind to pen to life performance. He plays Edward R. Murrow to the T and his hard work hopefully will not go unrecognized. The only problem with the performance is the performance that goes with the story itself which isn't the fault of the writer or the actor but just the way events occurred. They never show Murrow in his house or outside the NBC studio in fact so we never get to see the 'human' side of Murrow. Strathairn plays the part professionally and keeps it there. Maybe if Strathairn showed a bit of a tear drop or make a fist with anger could he seal his nomination. I see him grabbing a critics award or two but Oscar will have to wait for another time and movie to award this actor. Strathairn is the standout of the film but doesn't stand alone.The supporting cast is magnificent. Clooney as stated before gives a one-two punch performance along with Frank Langella whom Sasha Stone has on her site as a possible contender for supporting actor. And it makes sense; veteran actor, never nominated, a legend to some, and underrated. The time might be right. Patricia Clarkson, Robert Downey, Jr., and Jeff Daniels also give great supporting performances but they lack that 'one scene' that could get them to the short list. Daniels still has 'The Squid and the Whale', Downey, Jr. has 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang' and Clarkson had 'All the Kings Men' but now will have to wait on the reaction to 'The Dying Gaul' which I think isn't the film that will do it.Oscar predictions include a good bet for Best Picture with a leading actor nomination for David Strathairn. A supporting nod for Langella is in order if academy voters love it and want to acknowledge the veteran actor. I say Clooney has a 75/25 chance on a double nomination in screenplay and directing. He might just have the director's lone spot of the year. (lone spot means director nomination but not best picture nod) And one or two technical category nods including cinematography, film editing, and maybe even a costume design.Congratulations to the cast and crew for a terrific job on one of the best films of the year. You can bet this will be in my top 10 list at the end of the year. Good Night, and Good Luck folks.Grade: ***1/2/****",9,1,2,11 November 2006
Guardians of the Galaxy," The Best Marvel Movie Yet!
","James Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy is the best Marvel movie yet. I challenge anyone who would place Iron Man or The Avengers over this action-packed and thoroughly entertaining picture that is the definitive summer blockbuster. It's just f**king awesome! (pardon my French)Hilarious, innovative, and just super fun. I can't recall enjoying a movie this much, right along with a crowd, in quite some time. The less you know about the film and these characters, the better. I'm from a world of movie-watching but not so much on the comic book reading front. My knowledge of superheroes comes from watching Saturday morning cartoons. Like many movie lovers, probably one of the few that will actually admit it, I never heard of the 'Guardians of the Galaxy.' I had no idea who they were and what they did. This may have made the experience even more enjoyable. There a bunch of funny characters. I'll just say that.There's a moment that overcomes me in the middle of Guardians. Chris Pratt is walking across the screen, after just delivering about a dozen hardcore laughs that literally had me in tears; he's just about gained a theater full of new loyal fans, and Gunn decides to give him a money shot for all the ladies. He walks across the screen in his underwear, sweaty and doused in yellow paint, and heavily panting. I couldn't believe this is the same guy from NBC's 'Park and Recreation,' Bride Wars, and Her. He's come into his own, and has fully become a movie star, with talent to boot. His work as 'Peter Quell' trumps anything done by Robert Downey, Jr. in the Iron Man films. I'd go as far to say that he should heavily be considered a candidate for a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor (Comedy or Musical). Pratt is the new boy toy for every action figure having kid, and every horny Mom that pretends they hate 'these kinds of movies.'Coming into another big franchise following Star Trek and Avatar, Zoe Saldana moves quietly throughout the film as an unstoppable force as 'Gamora.' Kick-ass fight sequences, and an interesting enough story that should feel satisfying for even the most hardened movie snobs. Dave Bautista wrecks through the film as 'Drax' and even develops his own character ticks and beats that help him stand out considerably.As the voice of 'Rocket,' Bradley Cooper infuses a dynamic and comical performance that stands as one of the actor's best outings. All I could think of during the film was this is one of the many reasons the Academy needs a Digital and Voice Acting category. Something as lively and priceless as Cooper's voice work deserves some type of recognition. The same can go for Vin Diesel as Groot, though he lacks the speaking volumes to warrant consideration. I thoroughly enjoyed their relationship and dynamic and it's something that plays out completely well on-screen.Obviously, the film has faults. It's very heavy-handed on the whole 'we are one, we are friends' message. It actually starts to beat us over the head with it at times. The film also defies all the logic of physics. There are times that even for a superhero film, you have to raise your eyebrow. There's also not really any importance placed on the villain, and I'm not entirely sure I could recite his ultimate plan. This is no fault of Lee Pace as 'Ronan' - just an uninteresting story arc.Guardians of the Galaxy is the ultimate summer flick. Something that's just plain stupid fun for you and the whole family. Geeks will bow, audiences will cheer, and the film will secure itself as a new and enlightened franchise for years to come. Gunn's admiration for films like Independence Day, Star Wars, and Top Gun are on full display. There are even instances where I thought of Boogie Nights and Running with Scissors. It's a blend of every clever nuance and thing you love about the movies rolled into one spectacular experience. It's delicious in nearly every way.Dear younger generation, you have been given your 'Star Wars.' Go see it!",7,5,21,30 July 2014
The Imitation Game," Morten Tyldum's espionage thriller about Alan Turing is purely sensational with a performance for the ages by Benedict Cumberbatch...
","It took a little over 24 hours before I weighed in on my official thoughts on Morten Tyldum's The Imitation Game from The Weinstein Company. My initial reaction upon leaving the screening room was it was astonishing, a magnificent achievement that stands tall as one of the year's best movies. As the film continues to settle within my cinematic soul, this very well could be the best film of the year, anchored by a career best performance from the amazing Benedict Cumberbatch. Full disclosure, I'm fairly oblivious to European history and the heroes that had a hand in one of the deadliest wars in history. I've heard the name Alan Turing from high school and college but either didn't care enough to learn or have no recollection of his contributions. Minutes following the screening, Amazon.com got $15.82 from my bank account in order to read 'Alan Turing: The Enigma,' the book in which screenwriter Graham Moore based the story upon. Telling the story of Alan Turing, a mathematician who in 1939 led a pioneer in cracking one of the most difficult codes in history. His contributions paved the way for essentially the way we exist now. However, Turing, who is a homosexual, has to wrestle with his secret in order to keep his status and his work years later.Masterfully told and encompassing an emotional complexity, Tyldum's film is both engrossing and disturbing. It has genius aspirations in which it wants to exist in the cinematic world. It's an impeccable thriller, taut and brilliant, exploring the horrors of war along with the choices that doom mankind for all eternity. Tyldum is methodical and precise in which he decides to unravel the story, Turing is one of the fallen heroes of our history and his story stands as one of the most tragic. Screenwriter Moore crafts a murky, dark, yet totally enjoyable spy film that stands taller than any James Bond film ever released. It's a sure-fire Oscar contender for several Academy Awards including Best Picture. They should feel so lucky to have the gumption to choose something this methodical and majestic.Benedict Cumberbatch continues to climb the ladder as one of the best actors working today. After impressive performances August: Osage County, 12 Years a Slave, and TV's 'Sherlock,' this is the role that will make him a bonafide movie star. Oscar-winner or not, this will be looked upon like the greats such as Gene Hackman in The French Connection or any legendary 70's movie that you love today. Cumberbatch hones in on all of Turing's character flaws and good qualities that make him a real person. He constructs him from the toes up, inflicting mannerisms and behaviors that all ring true. He stimulates all the sensual beats that keep us fixated on a performance. I can't help but go back to someone like Joaquin Phoenix in The Master, who delivered a construction of epic proportions. Though based on a real person, the talented Cumberbatch ignites his own masterpiece performance. He follows the demons of Turing down to his bones. Unsure, arrogant, and dismissive to the world around him, Turing shows only what he must, what he chooses, and every once in a while, we get a front seat to his soul. Thank you Cumberbatch.The rest of the cast is completely on their game. It's probably a contender for the SAG Ensemble prize. Academy Award nominee Keira Knightley, as the feisty and fiery Joan Clark, is as loose and comfortable as I've ever seen her. She wears Joan like an old coat from the back of the closet. Remembering it fondly and seeing that it fits just perfect. She has all the things that make up an Oscar nominee; a scene that will likely bring you to tears, plenty of scenes that play as the comic relief in a dark tale, and being simply charming in every part of the film. I don't know when it's going to happen but the world needs to make Matthew Goode a mega-star. In his brief time on-screen, Goode makes his mark, becoming essentially a co-anchor with Knightley of the supporting players, showcasing a reason to give this guy his own leading role sooner rather than later. As our resident sleazy authority figure, Charles Dance shows that he's still got it. Mark Strong and Allen Leech also deliver memorable, fascinating scenes, both getting an opportunity to shine.Technical merits are no shortage of excellence on display. Oscar- winning Editor William Goldenberg (Argo) shows that tension is his second language. Cutting the film to perfection, and forcing your heart into throat, this espionage thriller succeeds for general audiences because of Goldenberg's efforts. It's something that anyone can seek out and get fully immersed into. Alexandre Desplat tacks another impressive composition to his already thick resume. With films like The Grand Budapest Hotel already in his arsenal, I assume this to be another Oscar citation in his future. Shot by the talented Oscar Faura, responsible for painting the canvas that was J.A. Bayona's The Impossible, he utilizes the standard brilliance of capturing a moment. Knows when to pull back and get close. Let's not forget the Production and Costume Design by Maria Djurkovic and Sammy Sheldon Differ. Those two will surely be mentioned for the rest of the film year.The Imitation Game is assertive and makes a serious claim as one of the best spy thrillers ever made. There are sub plots that all resonate and never feel forced. This will not only keep your tension level at a fever pitch but could leave you in tears to walk home with. It's a complete realistic view at the spy game that stands as one of the best films of the year and a performance for the ages from Benedict Cumberbatch. A captivating achievement that I'll likely remember for some time.",10,461,618,10 September 2014
Prisoners," 'Prisoners' is a tightly wound thriller featuring career bests from Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal...
","There is a sensitivity that Director Denis Villenueve and writer Aaron Guzikowski inhabit in bringing their newest film 'Prisoners' from Warner Bros. to the screen. Starring an Academy Award nominated cast that includes Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Terence Howard, Maria Bello, Viola Davis, Oscar-winner Melissa Leo, and Paul Dano, this is a smartly constructed and emotionally resound mystery thriller that is thoroughly enjoyable.The synopsis is fully in the trailer. When two young girls go missing, one belonging to Keller and Grace (Jackman and Bello), the other to Franklin and Nancy (Howard and Davis), a hot-shot detective (Gyllenhaal) is assigned to the case and relentlessly tries to find the clues that could lead to the whereabouts of the missing. When a mentally handicapped Alex Jones (Dano) is found near the scene of the disappearance with no hard evidence, Keller takes matters into his own hands.I have to say that I've never been this hypnotized with the works of Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal. Jackman, who is fresh of his inaugural nomination for Tom Hooper's 'Les Miserables' has capitalized in a massive way. Approaching his character with the ferocity that made him a star in the 'X-Men' franchises, he hammers his way into every scene, keeping the audience guessing about their own moral complexities. He tears into scenes in a way we've never seen him and layers his character with plenty of affection, empathy, grief, and rage. It's his best dramatic endeavor he's ever done.When it comes to Jake Gyllenhaal, many, and probably for the right reasons, gravitate towards his work in Ang Lee's 'Brokeback Mountain' as his shining moment in film history. I believe he's gone deeper in works like 'Jarhead' and 'Zodiac' but those were just the surface of what he can do as an actor. As Detective Loki, Gyllenhaal stands firm and tall in one of the year's finest performances. Terrifically executed as a man disconnected from real emotion, he finds himself enamored by the mystery surrounding two missing girls. He also orchestrates character beats and ticks that's reminiscent of Joaquin Phoenix's towering work in 'The Master' last year.What is very refreshing in the film is it offers a great reminder of how brilliant an actor Terence Howard is. The Oscar-nominated actor seemed to fall by the wayside following his nomination for 'Hustle and Flow' in 2006, coincidentally the same year Gyllenhaal snagged his first, and now has realized his capabilities when he chooses more dynamic and passionate characters. In a film that centers around his involvement, Paul Dano doesn't have too much to offer but is completely adequate in form.The film however is not entirely perfect. Aaron Guzikowski's depth screenplay offers a great mystery story, full of twists and turns, all the bit a tad predictable, but that's not where he falters so much. His construction of the female counterparts, Maria Bello, Viola Davis, and Melissa Leo, are not as crisply or smoothly put together as I'd like them to be. They each have one 'scene' that gives us their character's motivation and the look into their cinematic psyche however, some are thrown in quite lazily and manages to halt the story in spots.The film's technical merits all rise to the abilities of its cast. Roger Deakins, the most overdue Cinematographer in the business, captures stunning portraits of conversations, weather, and scenes that continue to prove his brilliance in the film world. The film's score is masterfully placed by Jóhann Jóhannsson while Joel Cox and Gary Roach edit the film to an impeccable pace. At 153 minutes, the film is detailed, precise, and engaging nearly throughout. I feel there's a shorter cut of the film that would surely be a Best Picture nominee for this year's Academy Awards if it existed. The film could still garner that support with what they have now, but I think there are aspects of the film members won't be able to get around. A high level of violence and torture scenes infused with a longer run time could keep people at a distance. One thing that can't be denied is the towering works of Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal. The two have offered plenty of memorable performances in their filmography, but their work in 'Prisoners' is cut and clear their best they've offered.'Prisoners' is a magnificent achievement for the film year. Thorough, enigmatic, and purely amazing. A must-see for the movie lovers.The film opens in theaters this Friday, September 20.",8,354,456,17 September 2013
Silence," 'Silence' Flourishes With Respect and Martin Scorsese's Ultimate Legacy
","Martin Scorsese has been a master of his craft for decades. It's hard not to consider him our single finest director working today. With films like 'Raging Bull,' 'Goodfellas,' 'The Wolf of Wall Street,' and now his newest endeavor 'Silence,' we must now relish with the fact that we are witnessing a grand master of sorts working right in front of our eyes. History has remembered 'Citizen Kane' and 'Vertigo.' These were two films not wholeheartedly recognized as masterpieces of their time. History now, however, will remember 'Silence,' a marvelous and inspiring cinematic experience not to be forgotten.'Silence' tells the story of two Jesuit priests (played by Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver), who in the seventeenth century, face violence and persecution when they travel to Japan to locate their mentor, Father Ferreira (played by Liam Neeson), and propagate Catholicism.'Silence' is Scorsese's most personal and beautiful film of his modern career. Labeling it just a 'passion project' does it no justice. It has etched out a new avenue in which we can explore film forever. He has explored some of the most enigmatic themes in film, whether it be about revenge, family or a general exercise to push the boundaries of the medium.With 'Silence,' he writes his most heartaching letter yet. There are filmmakers who are quickly trapped into the corner of 'indulgence' when taking on a production this personal to them. Scorsese gets into the trenches of the story, mysteriously performing his own deconstruction of his faith and what it has meant to him. You can't ask a director to be more involved in the house of his film. He builds the foundation, drawing from the soul of his spiritual ancestors, and gives them his most devoted respect. Scorsese gives the viewer the weight of the message and lets it rest upon us. We are desperately and quietly screaming for justice, in a land that isn't allowing such things. Simply put, it's awe-inspiring.Andrew Garfield is divinely spectacular. With a year that has included another strong turn in 'Hacksaw Ridge,' Garfield has shown himself to be one of the next generation's most gifted thespians. Adam Driver's vulnerability has never been matched in all his previous roles. He becomes the audience's spokesperson of doubt and logic, as Scorsese and writer Jay Cocks make him our voice of reason in a rich and layered dynamic.Issey Ogata is one of the year's vivid findings. Acting as the 'Hans Landa' of Catholic persecution, Ogata's Inquisitor Inoue nearly reinvents the spiritual nature of the film, stealing every scene he shares with another actor. It's been 32 years since Haing S. Ngor won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for 'The Killing Fields' and it's about time the Academy rewards a deserving Asian actor. With Ogata, a new Supporting Actor contender has emerged. Liam Neeson's work, though integral to the story, is a bit too brief to make a lasting impact.It's easy to write 'masterpiece' for a film, and let it be generally understood by the casual movie-goer that reads it. The word left by itself doesn't fully explain the film's technical mastery. Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto and Thelma Schoonmaker are masters of their crafts. Prieto frames the film to utter perfection, utilizing fog and blue-grey hues to capture the film's undying message of faith. Schoonmaker lets the story evolve into a construction of time, allowing the viewer to feel the 'weight' of the 'waiting.''Silence' is epic, poignant and inventive. It must be said: As someone who was raised Catholic, used to be a high school religion teacher, and had his own personal qualms with his Lord and Savior, 'Silence' spoke to me in a way I was not anticipating. I do recognize that there could be a large portion of the world, especially those who don't have strong feelings about any Christian religion, that may not be fully invested in the weight of its message. Scorsese set out to make a film about the ecstasy of one's own faith.How much do you value it? Why are there others so thirsty and hungry for its divine meanings and teachings? These are just two of many questions that the film dares to ask, and you really don't get the clear answer you may be searching for. For a select group, it could infuriate you, for others, it was just the tip of the iceberg of the glacier that lies beneath.The language of cinema is universal. The frames tell everything you need it to. Without words, a single image can change the world. What if 'Silence' was a silent film? What would that have offered in its quest for answers? It's remarkably creative, and on the surface, you can say it's repetitive in what it displays to the viewer. The continuous striking of faith beats you down, submitting to the film's own moral compass, and developing a new wave of art that we have only dreamed.'Silence' is imperative to our landscape. It is the crown jewel of Martin Scorsese's modern career, and in time, could be the defining film that history will use to represent him – his magnum opus.Grade: (★★★★)",10,0,1,19 February 2017
The Dark Knight," Dark natured but always in the light of greatness...
","The Dark Knight Director Christopher Nolan has created the newly invented and ultimately prestigious, The Dark Knight, the sequel to his revolutionary Batman Begins. Nolan has completely raised the bar and set the standards high for himself and any comic book film that will adapted from here on after. Nolan creates one of his darkest pictures to date, definitely his strongest so far from his already impressive film credits which includes Memento and The Prestige.The screenplay written by David S. Goyer and Christopher and Jonathan Nolan breathes new humanity into the Crusader. As we left off in the previous film, Batman is now fighting crime and sorting himself and Gotham City out into a safer haven for its people. Bruce Wayne and Batman are co-existing with the help of his butler Alfred, and technological analyst Lucius Fox. The three writers will put Batman through things never seen on film before. He will learn about sacrifice, and not jumping in front of a bullet or giving up your girlfriend sacrifice, Bruce will learn about real loss of self, integrity and identity. The film works and succeeds as a tragedy, not taken in any comic film before. The Dark Knight holds resonance and prestige as the way 1980's The Empire Strikes Back did as it held its own on its own merit and not its predecessor.Christian Bale returns as the Caped Crusader, both playing Batman and the millionaire Bruce Wayne and Bale like always is as dependable as can be. Always creating new characters, mannerisms, behavior, Bale is one of the great actors working today however, Bale as the dark knight this time around, seems forced, too controlled, too over-the-top. His Bruce Wayne was as always charming but something didn't seem to work when he transforms into Batman. His voice almost comes off like a lisp and almost like he's pushing too much.Michael Caine as Bruce Wayne's butler, Alfred, was amiable, gracious, and wise as he provides a balance to this film. He controls his emotions and acts as the film's father figure while he is on screen, the viewer feels at ease. Gary Oldman as the newly appointed Lieutenant Gordon is nearly flawless in poise and makes the role seem effortless. How Gary Oldman has flown under the Oscar radar in his long career is inexcusable, this man's supporting work is vast. Morgan Freeman, as always, gives a presence in a film that relaxes us as we're pulled through this thrill ride.Maggie Gyllenhaal, taking over Katie Holmes' previous role of Rachel Dawes puts forth a valiant effort and superior than Holmes' turn last time around but a realization has come to me following the film. For myself, the worst part of Batman Begins was Katie Holmes and I blamed the performance on her, which is ¾ true but after watching a great actress like Gyllenhaal, who has had impressive turns in Sherrybaby and World Trade Center, I've come to recognize that the character is just poorly written. Rachel Dawes is the fluke in Nolan's plan for this comic book franchise. She's unimportant, annoying, and not very likable. She holds some significance in Bruce Wayne's life and as we learn in the new film, now D.A. Harvey Dent's life, but she holds none in the viewers. The love triangle between the three is unnatural and puts forth a sour taste in your mouth.Aaron Eckhart who plays Harvey Dent puts forth his best performance of his career. Eckart who has really shown some promise over the years as we've seen in Erin Brockovich and Thank You for Smoking plays Harvey like Tommy Lee Jones from Batman Forever would have hoped for. Eckhart reveals Harvey's inner most demons but never loses the mystery of the man. He's tantalizing in the finale of the film and shows what a three dimensional character can really be.Now, what everyone has been talking about; Ledger's frightening turn will probably go down as one of the darkest and most creative villainous turns by any actor in American cinema. Nolan guides Heath down a corridor only Heath can follow, where the Joker's existence and style are revealed but only to himself. The only problem I've ever had with Tim Burton's take on Batman in 1989 is where the Joker fits in Batman's life. Jack Nicholson played him marvelously and pretty much the way any comic book fan interprets the Joker in real life but when it is revealed that Jack Napier a.k.a. The Joker murders Bruce's parents when he is a child, you lost me. It was a disappointing turn to what could have been a great film. Rest assured, Joker doesn't kill Bruce's parents or pet gerbil, his entrance and exit are that of a mystery. Ledger keeps us at a distance so we understand very little but are intrigued enough to keep learning and waiting. This is the performance of the year thus far and should be viewed if only for the performance.The film is not flawless, and should not be overdrawn in the mind of the viewer. I waited for two viewings and post-Dark Knight Chatter to write a review as I did not want to be influenced by the crazed fanatics. The film does drag a bit in the last third of the picture and as stated before, there are some performance errors, but all in all this is the best picture of the year so far and if the Academy Awards ever had a chance to be cool with anyone outside the artsy crowd, this is the time. Consideration should follow for Picture, Supporting Actor, and a slew of technical categories. Smooth cinematography, cutthroat editing, eye candy of the sort art direction and remarkable sound and visual effects are the standouts. The Dark Knight to encapsulate is plainly genius.***½ /****",8,3,8,30 July 2008
Everest," Thin Air and Thin Characters
","Baltasar Kormakur's 'Everest' finds itself in a precarious position. One half of the film is a harrowing and emotionally resonate story of survival, loss, and the human condition. The other half, is a massively underdeveloped story, chalk full of celebrity heads that are thrust into a movie that offers no type of care and engagement for the audience to latch onto. I'm unsure I could even tell you any of the character's names. The audience struggles to identify them by their 'group name' and multi-colored Northface coats.'Everest' tells the story of the 1996 Mount Everest disaster, where a group of climbers were killed. Starring Jason Clarke, John Hawkes, Jake Gyllenhaal, Josh Brolin, Sam Worthington, Robin Wright, Emily Watson, and Keira Knightley, the all-star cast are offered basic blueprints into the emotional center of their real-life counterparts. However, vaguely expressed through the script by Justin Isbell and Lem Dobbs, most of them are left in the dark and are unable to convey much of anything other than 'be really worried or be really scared.'Starting with the positives, a 3D IMAX experience is well earned with the visuals that look like their plucked out of the Discovery Channel or NatGeo. Cinematographer Salvatore Totino leads a spectacular look upon the largest mountain in the world. Totino offers the audience a first-hand account of the power the mountain entails. The height, cold, and wind, are apparent and exist vivaciously in every frame he chooses to portray. Dario Marianelli's subtle score is appreciated as he doesn't go overboard in scenes where he could have easily let his organs reign.From a technical standpoint, editor Mick Audsley seemed to be the one who dropped the ball. Quick cuts between a dozen characters, all who apparently have their own story and agenda, was not a good idea. We never get a clear introduction to any of the character's lives with the exception of Clarke and to some extent, John Hawkes (but credit must be given to Hawkes who delivers each line with clarity and certainty). The second half of the film jumps between so many people, all of which are at different locations, but we never have a real sense of where anyone is or worst yet, why or how they died?From an acting standpoint, there are bright spots. The aforementioned John Hawkes is an everyday man, who gives 'Doug' a sense of purpose and identity. Keira Knightley's emotional pregnant wife is an audacious presence, and one that we truly care about. In the film's most emotional moment, its her dedication to that moment, without overdoing it, that the film comes alive. Jason Clarke helms the film with an energy that works well and his interactions with Knightley are the film's true highlights. The rest of the cast well, they're there. Some bearded, some crying, and some really cold.It's hard to completely ding 'Everest' for what it sets out to do. What I keep coming back to is the question, why? Why is this disaster given a platform, in the form of film, need to be told? Is it a pregnant wife at home that makes it more compelling? Is it a person losing body parts? I overheard someone once say, this is 'White People Problems: The Movie.' It's morose in the sense that individuals lost their lives, and there is a moment in the movie where you get the sense of why they choose to climb the mountain. On top of the highest peak, where 747's fly high, they look upon the earth like God. I get it but I can't say I care any more or less following the credits. 'Rocky' made us want to be a boxer. 'Gravity' scared the hell out of us going to space (if we ever planned on it). 'Everest' makes us just say 'okay?'The final shot of the film chosen by Kormakur, is weirdly inserted and I'm completely unsure about what I was supposed to be feeling. A comparison can be made to something like 'The Impossible' by J.A. Bayona, a film that set out to do some of the same things. Where 'Everest' misses the mark, is in giving the audience the tools needed to make an investment in a story, and then see a return on that investment. Let's just say the DOW dropped on this one.",6,2,4,19 September 2015
Into the Wild," Into Perfection
","Director Sean Penn delivers the most beautiful film to enter theaters in decades, Into the Wild. Starring newcomer Emile Hirsch as Christopher, a recent graduate of Emory University who decides to pick up and leave behind the material possessions of the world and walk the Earth. Based on a true story, Christopher 's life ends in tragedy but alas, there is no tragedy in the film, rather the essence of exquisiteness of the world as Christopher shows us everything we should be in awe about, that surrounds us every day.One of the best cast ensembles constructed this year, Penn gives each of his actor's a objective and draws it out of them like a needle. Hirsch's character, being the most examined obviously, carries the film on his shoulders as other great thespians have in the past like Adrien Brody in The Pianist and Tom Hanks in Cast Away. Hirsch holds no boundaries in obtaining Christopher's most sensitive areas and engulfing them in himself as if possessed by the man. As he travels the states, he meets a slew of characters along the way.Vince Vaughn showing us his dramatic acting chops, embodies a quality not seen by the actor before. Performances in films like Wedding Crashers, which I thought was brilliant and The Break-Up has put him in a boat Jim Carrey can't seem to get out of. Vaughn is more than comedy here, he's performing a man who you love to love, a man who's flaws don't carry any weight in caring for him. Maybe Vaughn's transition will be better and smoother than Carrey's.Catherine Keener, who has been on my bad list as of late for her mediocre nominated performance in Capote, as completely revolutionized her acting game. With a sense of grace and splendor, Keener shows she can inhabit a character and let her ware on her soul. You can see pain and joy throughout the film, and when she's off screen you can't wait until you see her again. When she returns, you're overcome with joy because you knows Christopher is in safe hands.Young talents, Kristin Stewart and especially Jena Malone are sensational. Stewart as the smitten young girl in need of love is heartbreaking altogether. Malone who has showed some promise in her earlier career with performances in Stepmom and Saved! shows something original and tender as Christopher's estranged sister. As she narrates the picture, you can hear the passion and desolation in her voice. As she tries to gives us insight into her family's world and the reasoning behind Christopher's exit, we're shown the tragedy of the American lifestyle everyone so desperately yearns for. Money, wealth, and materials cannot buy love, compassion, and safety. William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden hold those images to heart as they give their performances as Chris' parents.It's in the final twenty minutes in the film when Christopher meets his last major human contact. A old man exemplifying loneliness to the most potent degree and humanity in the most striking wonders. Hal Holbrook takes on this role and completely shatters all acting competition and gives on the best performances of the year and by far, his career. Holbrook, showing anguish in his eyes, layers the character with emotion upon emotion. Its in his finale encounter with Christopher he seals the award for Best Supporting Actor at this year's Academy Awards.As stated before, Penn's direction here even though forceful in audience's attention, is no laughing matter. He ranks himself amongst the greats of other directors, Clint Eastwood, Sidney Lumet, etc. As powerful as he usually is in front of the camera, he's even more effective behind it. Into the Wild, is truly the most breathtaking and moving film of the year. All should experience it, and I myself, wish that I could live if a ¼ of what this man did in his final years of his life.Grade: ****/****",10,2,6,7 January 2008
Blood Diamond," Blood spilled by the Script
","Director Edward Zwick brings us the authentic and socially significant Blood Diamond starring Academy Award nominees Leonardo DiCaprio and Djimon Hounsou and winner Jennifer Connelly. This is the story of Danny Archer, (DiCaprio) a South African smuggler who crosses the paths of Solomon Vandy, (Hounsou) a fisherman in search of his lost son and Maddy Bowen, (Connelly) an American journalist in search of a story. When Solomon hides a rare diamond, everyone including Archer will stop at nothing to gain possession.Zwick who has brought some tantalizing and underrated pictures such as The Last Samurai and Glory has truly brought forth a magnificent piece of cinema here. Zwick can't save the film however from the lukewarm script by Charles Leavitt. The message of the film is quite powerful, quickly engaging the viewer and hooking us into it. The film's visual aspects is what pulls the viewer through with the journey a diamond makes from the ruins to the finger.Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of his strongest performances of his career and the year. Alongside his powerful work in The Departed, 2006 belonged to him. No other performance this year had us invested in a character we know we shouldn't be loving. Its quite remarkable how engaged we become with Danny, the evil, the antics, the redemption, all these qualities arouse the audience in character development. DiCaprio takes his first huge step into an adult role which he's struggled with for the past ten years. Becoming a male Meryl Streep, taking on an accent and an against type character is sensational for the young actor.Djimon Hounsou, showing us high range emotion at every glance ends up coming up a little short. It wasn't really his fault, his character didn't have the investment that DiCaprio's did. As he searches for his son, the story disenchants the audience so by the time we're ready for a meaningful reunion, the audience is left behind in the premise. Hounsou did the best with his material but doesn't even come close to his previous powerhouse performances in Amistad and In America.Jennifer Connelly's talent is entirely wasted in a character of no importance or significance to the story. Her love affair with Archer is so distracting and unwanted that by near end of the film, we yearn for extinction. This is Leavitt's biggest failure of the picture in the creation of a character. Connelly just can't gain any traction after her Oscar for A Beautiful Mind; she remains on the sideline and as the role seemed promising, it bombs from entry.Technical aspects of the film are decent enough with strong film editing, cinematography and musical score. All barely above average, nothing spectacular, just a mediocre picture. I'm afraid I can't blame Zwick, he gets an A for effort as well as the cast. The film failed on story alone.Grade: **½/****",7,2,3,23 October 2007
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," This is utterly Eternal in every sense
","From Director and co-writer Michel Gondry comes the innovative and completely original Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind starring Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet. This could easily be considered the best love story of modern time which stands up in the leagues of Love Affair, Ghost, and Sleepless in Seattle.The film tells the story of Joel and Clementine, two thirty-somethings who are brought together by fate and torn apart by indifference's. When Joel finds out that Clementine gets a procedure to erase Joel from his memory, Joel strikes back with similar consequences. While Joel is getting the procedure done, which erases from most recent memory and back, he realizes his love for Clementine is very much alive. He fights against the 'machine' to remember as much about her as possible.Jim Carrey gives the best performance of his career. His Joel is very vulnerable and awkward. We have never seen Carrey play a character like this when so little of his normal film antics come out. The early release date ruined his chances for consideration and with previous snubs for The Truman Show and especially Man on the Moon, Carrey is due for some serious recognition.Kate Winslet, who is arguably one of the greatest actresses working today, plays Clementine so incredibly free-spirited and vivacious, she's nearly unrecognizable. As awkward as the character is, Clementine possesses a special sexiness and attractive quality that draws the viewer to her and Winslet is at the helm of this ship. Not only is she incredibly sympathetic, she is the heroin of the picture. We haven't seen a film where the natural charisma of humanity is engaged so much in a character's words, expressions and general aura. The love for the character is what the viewer takes home with them and we wonder about her as well as Joel.The rest of the supporting cast is exceptional in their own ways: Tom Wilkinson, arguably snubbed for the win for his portrayal in In the Bedroom, brings the role of the rather cold-hearted doctor to life. His Dr. Howard is rather two-dimensional but Wilkinson does an exceptional job of making him purely human. Elijah Wood as the incredibly annoying and obnoxious Patrick takes him to new realms of acting. Wood has a hard time breaking free of his two-dimensional personality and making characters authentic. This is Wood's best portrayal yet including his powerful portrayal in Radio Flyer.Kirsten Dunst has returned to form since her breakout performance in 1994's Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles, but she gives an admiral effort here as the lovely assistant Mary. This isn't just great comedic turn for her but an tremendous dramatic one. Mark Ruffalo as the zany and intelligent Stan is juicy in dialogue but rather one note in emotions. Stan is very likable but just can't get off the ground in terms of development and range. A disappointing turn for Ruffalo especially since we've seen what he can do in his breakthrough performance in You Can Count on Me.In the end it's the screenplay by Charlie Kaufman, Michel Gondry and Pierre Bismuth that are the stars of the film. Kaufman who has wrote some of the most innovative films of modern cinema peaks at this point in his career. Adaptation, Being John Malkovich, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind don't even measure to the life of this film. The intangible life of the film is shown through ideas, energy, and strong development of story and creature.Eternal Sunshine shines on so many levels that you can't even start to touch the highest points of the film. This is the greatest story of all time, and the belief of love and redemption is visually stunning.Grade: ****/****",10,1,4,27 October 2007
Avatar," One of the best cinematic experiences ever...
","Forgive me, I'm going to jump from professional to fan boy for a while here. I haven't had the jitters after a film the way I've had for Avatar in quite sometime. James Cameron's Avatar is the most entertaining and enthralling cinematic experiences of my life. It is incredible, simply put. What Cameron has done here is the most passionate film project put out since Steven Spielberg released Schindler's List. His attention to detail and his zeal for pushing the envelope is so admirable to any filmmaker or actor who will ever do another film from this point on.Avatar is the story of Jake Sully, a paraplegic marine, who replaces his brother on a secret mission to infiltrate the Na' vi, the colony of beings that sit on the planet of Pandora, where there is a precious ore, that sells at a ridiculous amount. When Jake learns the ways of the Na' vi, his feelings and learnings will put him and the people he trusts in dangerous jeopardy.The performances here, in the sense of reacting, becoming, and understanding what Cameron has written are astounding. Not to be confused with a sensational bravura performance from some of the centuries best such as Marion Brando, Tom Hanks, or Diane Keaton; these actors along with the director inhabit these visual transformations with special effects as if they are have lived these beings all their lives. This is all based on character movements and reactions. Sam Worthington, as Jake Sully, is an actor who's on his way to becoming a star. Though he has problems with his Aussie accent often enough in the film, he gets the job done. Zoe Saldana, who plays Neytiri, a Na' vi huntress, is thrilling and electrifying. Stephen Lang, as the rock hard Colonel Miles, takes on a villainous turn to a new level in science fiction. He offers actual emotion and emotes evil to the audience and gains our hatred easily. Sigourney Weaver as the beautiful Dr. Grace, is sufficient enough to have on screen again teamed with Cameron. She lives inside her role with effortless ease, but suffers from some of the typical James Cameron cheesy lines.Narratively the film works perfectly on the cinematic level. The first forty minutes or so require patience and hope as it is the weakest part of the film and offers some dreariness, but when the second act takes off, it's sky high with no limits for James Cameron. Avatar delivers the best action sequences put on film of all time. That is the boldest statement I have ever made in all my years of criticism. I sat on this for two days before charging it out, but I mean it. It is the best visual experience of my life, period.Other than those visuals, the film pops with all the other technical aspects thrown into one. Art Direction is killer as the two worlds blend in perfectly for an acceptable time. The Film Editing is the crowning achievement of the film as it also offers the perfect blend of the two worlds, enticing the viewer and shifting us around. Mauro Fiore is the threat for a Cinematography Oscar this year. It was if the viewer sat down in a chair, put on glasses, and was literally placed on Pandora, spaceships, and floating mountains. The viewer can feel so engulfed by the imagery, you feel like you can smell the leaves from the trees. Avatar is utterly hypnotizing. James Horner's score is some of the best work done in his career. It offers a variable of devastation that moves the viewer to near tears. It goes back to his work on Titanic, where the musical instruments lifted the material immensely. The entire sound team is also locked and loaded for Oscar recognition as the feeling of animals, machines, and arrows buzzing by your head leave you imprisoned in Cameron's exquisite film.James Cameron has come back home ladies and gentlemen Cameron is back, bigger, badder, and mature in his crowning work of his career. Terminator 2: Judgment Day and Titanic do not even compare anymore. This is the film that can blend the fans of those two films together and lock Cameron into your heart. He's a definite spoiler for a directing bid for the Academy Awards. You have admire the raw, natural talent the man has. How could you ever conceive such an experience and put that much effort and work into it and have it pay off? The box office success will surely keep him in the minds of voters for various critics' awards. His screenplay, leaps and bounds better than 1997's Best Picture Winner, is primed, developed and ripe for the taking. Though, you do acquire the tacky and atypical dialogue you expect from a science fiction director of this caliber, you can appreciate the effort and the honesty of it all. James Cameron is everything Michael Bay wishes he was, to put it bluntly.Avatar will bring also great actors putting their best foot forward such as Giovanni Ribisi, who is as underrated as they come. Michelle Rodriguez who exudes sexy like any woman starring in a sci-fi epic. Joel Moore, showing his range outside of his comedic work in Dodgeball: An Underdog Story. And the classy veteran actors, CCH Pounder and Wes Studi, who just simply don't work enough.Avatar is one of the best films of the year. The most exciting, thrilling, and superb work you'll feast your eyes on in any theater this century. Cinema, forever, will remember the benchmark that James Cameron placed not only for himself, but for any man, daring to change the game, the way Cameron did. Avatar is a movie experience to be remembered, and please experience in a movie theater first.***½/****",8,1594,2644,14 December 2009
Drag Me to Hell," Drag Me Through the Laughs
","Drag Me to Hell is simply put, one of the best horror films in years. It never takes itself too seriously and lets itself take its course to where it's destined to go, a comedic-horror gem. A bit of a copycat from Stephen King's Thinner, it tells the story of Christine Brown, a bank loan officer trying desperately to become assistant manager. When a old gypsy woman comes in to ask for an extension of her mortgage, Christine decides to take control and deny her claim. The gypsy woman then curses young Christine and prolong her final days before being 'dragged to hell.' Sam Raimi, director of Spider-Man takes this on and shows he's the perfect match to breathe new life into the horror genre. Alison Lohman, who once was very promising in her outstanding performances in White Oleander and Matchstick Men, doesn't capitlize on that promise. The role doesn't demand much of her but she remains throughout the film, extremely unlikable. Even her boyfriend Clayton played by Justin Long can't give her sympathy for the viewer. The comedy in the film doesn't walk the comedic line like Old School or Wedding Crashers but recreates a grotesque new type of humor in which the audience enjoys the pain and suffering of our protagonist and you shouldn't feel guilty about either. Drag Me to Hell doesn't pretend to be anything it isn't and that's what you have to admire most. Is it Oscar worthy? Absolutely not but its definitely worth a watch if you're into the genre and you shouldn't be afraid to like, if not love it for its personality.***/****",7,2,4,15 June 2009
Selma," Ava DuVernay's passion pours from the screen with a history making performance from David Oyelowo...
","Passionate, informative, and tenderly told, Ava DuVernay's vision of Martin Luther King Jr. and his fight for voters' rights is fully realized in her newest film 'Selma.' Written by Paul Webb, the film is ambitious, moving, and features a performance fit for the history books from David Oyelowo. It's one of the single best things you can see in 2014.In a time where the state of our country is in disarray over race and politics, 'Selma' hits our doorsteps at the right time for both sides of the coin to indulge and see how far we've come, or how little we actually have. 'Selma' shows the good and the bad, the perfect and imperfect characteristics of one of the most important figures in the fight for civil rights. There's respect, which goes without question, but there's an emotional and raw honesty that DuVernay and Webb choose to tell us about the man who was Dr. King. She doesn't paint the rosey picture you'd come to expect from standard biopics these days. She lays it out, leaving us to decide for ourselves if something outside of what he contributed to our country is great enough to look passed. DuVernay offers in many ways, the single best direction of the year.Invigorating from beginning to end, David Oyelowo owns every frame of the picture. You don't see performances like this too often especially of a real-life figure like MLK. I go back to works like Denzel Washington ('Malcolm X'), Ben Kingsley ('Gandhi'), and George C. Scott ('Patton') to find a more jaw-dropping or complex acting performance. Something like this only seems to come around once a decade. This may be our decade's. It's more than just the embodiment, it's the decisions in the silence that makes Oyelowo so amazing. You will remember this performance forever.The entire cast does an admirable to amazing job in their respective roles. Carmen Ejogo is simply electrifying as Coretta Scott King. An impeccable example of wearing the emotions and feelings at the brim without letting go. Just sensational top to bottom.Despite some hiccups in the accent department, Tom Wilkinson and Tim Roth are serviced well as Lyndon B. Johnson and George Wallace. Both have their opportunities to stand out in their respective scenes but ultimately stand as reminders that we are eagerly waiting to get back to Dr. King.DuVernay's triumph comes from the extras and smaller name cast she utilizes as sprinkles in every instance that they appear. Stan Houston as the treacherous Sheriff Clark is superbly focused and embodies the mindset of every unfortunate person of hate during the time. Henry G. Sanders and Keith Stanfield in many ways become the heart and soul of the film without no more than just a few moments of screen time. Oprah Winfrey and Lorraine Toussaint also execute their roles proficiently.The slick and vivacious manner in which 'Selma' is assembled is thanks to the genius people behind the camera. Cinematographer Bradford Young is just too great at what he does at this point in his career. With another stunning framing form in J.C. Chandor's 'A Most Violent Year,' he rises in the ranks to join Roger Deakins and Emmanuel Lubezki as one of the most exciting DP's. Spencer Averick's editing keeps 'Selma' on pace, and engaging 100% of the time. Jason Moran's score is palpable and justified in every sense of its usage.'Selma' is just a joy to behold, a magnificent example of passionate filmmaking that lacked sorely in 2014. It propels DuVernay among the ranks of the best filmmakers working today. Naturally brought to tears, it's a gut-wrenching and honest look into our history. Fulfilling, promised, and profound. One of the year's best films.",10,20,46,24 December 2014
The Artist," Should be Oscar's Best Picture of 2011
","When witnessing the evolution of film, it's hard to grasp how it went from a seemingly simple concept of silent imagery into a loud, uproarious third dimension experience. Michel Hazanavicius' silent film The Artist plays homage to the origins of our cinema in a general manner while attaining a massive respect that can't be denied. The film tells the story of George Valentin (Jean Dujardin), a silent film actor megastar who withers away into obscurity when the introduction of 'talkies' meets monumental popularity. Movie extra Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo) is a star on the rise who's admiration for George's work runs much deeper than the film's they share. Writer/Director Michel Hazanavicius explores the deepest parts of his soul which he calls 'a love letter.' What a beautiful letter it was. He makes conscious choices to illustrate the medium in the most toxic and potent fashion. A Q & A with Hazanavicius' at the end of the picture placed much into perspective. His funny, mild-tempered personality will carry him extremely far in this year's Oscar race. He could easily be the new director that everyone roots for. His stamp on the film is evident and his adoration and tribute to the genre is clear and ostentatious.Dujardin and Bejo showing Oscar all they got... The obvious question is how does the silence work and is it done well? Tying in with the prominent theme of silence, the presentation is an absolute marvel. Hazanavicius' respect for film bleeds out the screen into the audience and with so little words, we are transported into a world of unspoken expressions and explosive representation. The narrative is so uniquely relevant and intricately precise, that every scene is as equally important as the one before it. There's no fluff just brilliance. Production design by Laurence Bennett alters the viewer's perception of reality and engages a time travel experience to Hollywood 1927. The sets are so imaginative and exquisite, the film runs like a hybrid of classic films like Rebecca (1940) and Angels with Dirty Faces (1938). Cinematographer Guillaume Schiffman shoots the film with a modern camera but attacks each scene with finesse and diligence like an old pro. He captures some of the best shots seen this year on film. Hazanavicius not only writes and directs this triumphant piece of cinema, he dips his hand into the editing process with Anne-Sophie Bion. The duo know their pace and they know when to give more and pull back. At 100 minutes of pure cinematic magic, it's one of the rare instances in film where it begins and ends perfectly. Bringing to light the gorgeous production design, the gray whirlwind images shoots the costume design by Mark Bridges to the forefront. Bridges captures sharply the essence of time especially with Peppy's wardrobe. An awards magnet indeed. The star of the technical show is Ludovic Bource, a composer that just catapulted himself into the big leagues as composers John Williams and Alexandre Desplat. In a silent film, the music is important and needs to be on queue every second. Bource knows when to play it rough and especially when to retreat and let the film speak for itself. It's not overkill in the slightest. The supporting players, which American audiences will know more than our two polarizing leads, are effective in their respective roles. John Goodman proves to be the strongest of the players, ripping through scenes of comedic brilliance and showing that he still has everything in his armor. Penelope Ann Miller, an underused and undervalued actress during her prime returns to form as the beautiful Doris, a brokenhearted housewife looking for some attention. James Cromwell plays Clifton, the 'Alfred-type' driver to Dujardin's 'Bruce Wayne,' a tantalizing and endearing performer that shakes the hearts of the viewers. Malcolm McDowell shows brief but subtle showmanship. The Artist is the year's finest and most wonderful film. The Academy Awards can stop looking, this is their winner for Best Picture 2011. A fine piece of cinema that will hopefully be clutched by moviegoers for years to come.",10,20,36,6 November 2011
Invictus," One of Clint's Best...
","In surely one of his lightest and straight-forward works of his career, Clint Eastwood has achieved one of the most inspirational films of the year with his new film, Invictus.Starring Academy Award Winners Morgan Freeman as South African President Nelson Mandela and Matt Damon as Rugby Captain Francois Pienaar, Invictus is a picture full of emotion, magnetism, and revelation. What critics and audiences may be deceived by is belief that this is THE Nelson Mandela biopic which it is not. It is the story of Nelson Mandela's first years as President of the culturally separated country South Africa in 90's. In a way to unify his people, Mandela used the country's love for Rugby to connect the whites and the blacks. As their record has been less than impressive, no one expects anything notable from the Springboks. Mandela taps the captain of the team to rally his troops and surge into battle for the greater good of his country.Everything about Invictus works on so many degrees of the medium based on the book 'Playing the Enemy.' The film never comes off as too pretentious or egotistical; it requires nothing more from the viewer than an open mind and heart. Eastwood directs the film perfectly, laying back when he needs to, never pushing the subject matter or shoving it down our throats. He utilizes all the skills we've come to love about his earlier works in Million Dollar Baby, Mystic River, and Letters from Iwo Jima. The use of light shows a character' s vulnerability inhabiting their souls or a score by Kyle Eastwood that offers both zeal and subtlety during a rugby match. Cinematographer Tom Stern hits another one out of the park, catching all the fury and apprehension of all the different elements of this strenuous time. Joel Cox and Gary Roach edit the film with the perfect amount of precision and friction. Morgan Freeman as Mandela is a wonderful charmer, showing the man's most hostile yet tranquil behaviors. Not necessarily the most engulfed characterization seen on film this year as Freeman's accent comes in and out of remission, but it's a tremendous performance worthy of an Oscar nomination. Matt Damon, showing himself as one of the best working actors today, doesn't have enough of the character depth and arc to carry the picture. Damon's performance doesn't allow him to really go anywhere. It's a superb turn, with a great accent inhabitance, that warrants credit where the credit is due. However, Damon requires nothing more than a little motivational speaking and responsive humility.Invictus, is one of the best pictures of the year, standing in the ranks of one of the best sports films of the decade. This is the type of film that Oscar will likely be all over and fall in love with. I concur. ****/****",9,196,252,4 December 2009

How to Train Your Dragon," Trained Very Well...
","DreamWorks studios has raised the bar for themselves and have proved themselves to be a visual competitor of Pixar Animations with their new film, How to Train Your Dragon. This animated gem with the voice talents of Jay Baruchel, and a comedic cast ensemble of voices, is one of the dazzling adventures to blaze the screen this 2010. The film tells the story of little Hiccup, a young, small Viking who has been long trying to prove himself as a fierce warrior to his huge in mass father and village. When he finally captures one of the world's most ferocious breed of dragons, young Hiccup discovers a world, no Viking could have ever imagined.The screenplay by this five man and woman writing team is decent, though at times not as engaging as other CGI films that have ignited screens on fire for the past few years, it's an admirable step in the right direction for DreamWorks studios. It's leaps and bounds over last year's Monsters vs. Aliens, which wasn't half bad itself so I can appreciate the growth. The story is straight- forward, a bit predictable, and in its climax and bit heavy.As many have stated just by looking at the preview for the film, the visual sequences with the dragons and flying are some of the most beautiful shots seen on screen this thus far. For the majority of the film, the viewer can find himself/herself in utter awe at the color schemes and stunning work shown.***/****",7,1,6,30 March 2010

His use of shadows, CGI, and choices in which to convey and portray emotions is downright genius. Becoming essentially another character in the story, Deakins gives a master's class on cinematography for future craftsmen and women to behold. It's a work that will surely land him his thirteenth Oscar nomination.Above that, we are treated to fantastic and awards worthy performances. Emily Blunt, as seen in nearly everything she touches, shows herself as one of the most interesting and endearing actresses working today. Her courage and vulnerability for Kate is personified by Blunt's ability to connect with the character's soul. She lays into Kate calmly, echoing great performances like Jessica Chastain in 'Zero Dark Thirty' but with more reserve.Benicio Del Toro is downright magnificent. As Alejandro, he delivers his best performance since '21 Grams.' A dedicated sensation that calls back to all types of performances such as Javier Bardem in 'No Country for Old Men' or Gene Hackman in 'The French Connection.' You won't be able to take your eyes off him. Josh Brolin utilizes every ounce of his charm that has made him one of the most sought after actor's in the business. A memorable, though understated and undervalued character that you do want more clarity about. Other cast members like Jon Bernthal, Jeffrey Donovan, Victor Garber, and especially Daniel Kaluuya are given their fair share of opportunity, which all take well.As a technical endeavor, 'Sicario' also succeeds in its vibrantly living sound design, and illustrious score by Academy Award nominee Jóhann Jóhannsson. The two are married in a blistering union of tension and heart palpitations. Editor Joe Walker is a shining star behind the scenes as well, thanks to his precision and patience in bringing a scene right to the edge, and knowing when and where to take it next. It's his most innovative work yet, even surpassing his nominated work on '12 Years a Slave.'Goes without saying that 'Sicario' is Denis Villenueve's best work to date. Coming from someone that thoroughly enjoyed 'Prisoners' and tolerated 'Enemy,' this is his most accessible and compelling piece. If anything, he's just so damn exciting to watch these days, as he locates strange vehicles for actor's and craftsmen to come together. He takes on a genre that may feel familiar, like the drug cartel, but makes it feel new and smart.'Sicario' is hands down one of the year's best films.",8,188,281,12 September 2015
Les Misérables," Les Miserables is Broadway Magic on the Silver Screen!
","In what seems like an eternity, Tom Hooper's long-awaited Les Miserables starring Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe, and Anne Hathaway has finally been screened and finished. Director Hooper came out to introduce his film at the Alice Tully Theater at Lincoln Center on Friday, November 23, 2012 and explained that he had just finished the picture at 2 a.m. the evening before. The wait was well worth it. Les Miserables is not only stunningly powerful, and beautifully crafted, it's the best stage musical adaptation since Rob Marshall's Chicago (2002). Incredibly moving and featuring some of the most powerful musical numbers ever constructed, Tom Hooper tops his previous film The King's Speech (2010) with artistry and passion.The film tells the story of Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman), a paroled prisoner in the 1800s that over the course of decades, attempts to find redemption while a police inspector Javert (Russell Crowe) pursues him relentlessly.What astonishes me is how emotionally invested I became with the characters. I've never witnessed the stage musical on Broadway so this is my first outing with the musical. Hooper brings focus to each player and ensures they are an integral part of the story and film. Jean Valjean is our hero, placed firmly front and center, attached to the screen and centered cinematically in the medium for all the audience to invest. Jackman has never been better, delivering his most devoted and tender turn of his career. His opening number 'What Have I Done?' and near closing 'Bring Him Home' are his shining moments showcasing a vocal master class and a sensational acting piece that will put to rest any doubts about how talented he really is. It's unfortunate that despite his career-topping work, the Best Actor race is incredibly competitive and even more stacked. It's not a sure-thing for him to be named among the nominees but a strong campaign with a constant reminder of his preparation for the role, losing 30 pounds, vocal training, etc. could push him over.Russell Crowe in the role of Javert was the only principal actor not to be featured (prominently) in the full-length trailer and featurette, placing speculation in his abilities to sing for the role. Unfortunately, standing next to the likes of Jackman, Eddie Redmayne, and other cast members, his vocals are merely satisfactory. There are many who may find his work here grating and ill-fitting. Physically, Crowe fits the role quite well. He's always been an outstanding actor, proving time after time that he can deliver in the right roles, singing roles notwithstanding. His final number 'Soliloquy' shows his limitations considerably but Crowe cannot be completely faulted. He makes do with what he has and is satisfactory.In the role of Fantine, Anne Hathaway sings and seals her Oscar speech with 'I Dreamed a Dream.' Despite her role being incredibly brief, she makes an undeniable impression and has solidified herself in the Best Supporting actress category. Hathaway lost nearly 15-pounds for the role, cut her hair off, and vocally prepared for weeks. Hathaway doesn't just act like Fantine; she becomes her, with blood, sweat, and tears and talent, voice, and art. It's her best turn since Rachel Getting Married (2008).As Epinone, Samantha Barks is one of the year's found treasures. Devastatingly heartrending in her number 'On my Own,' Barks shows she was born for the role. Is Barks Oscar-worthy? You bet she is. As Cosette, Amanda Seyfried puts her best practices to use as she sings delightfully and remains a warming presence. Don't get me started on Young Cosette played by Isabelle Allen who is cute as a button and full of acting abilities. In our rare instances of comedy, Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter stand out among a great ensemble. 'Master of the House' is a hilarious scene that has the two performers doing what they do best.When you feel like you're down by a few runs, a coach always sends in his pinch hitter to shut the other team down. In this case, Tom Hooper got a whiff of other viable contenders like Steven Spielberg's Lincoln and Ben Affleck's Argo closing in on the Oscar game, Hooper went into his arsenal and sent in the stand out and very talented Eddie Redmayne to rid any doubts that Les Miserables is not the year's most innovative picture. More importanly, Redmayne has put himself in a prime position to be one of cinema's most gifted thespians in years to come. As Marius, Redmayne embodies him, heart and soul, and allows it to pour from the screen and into the aisles tear by tear. Incredibly moving, Redmayne during 'Empty Chairs at Empty Tables,' will make you believe in the power of Les Mis and even more, the power of the movies. Eve Stewart's Production Design is stellar and stands brightly next to other period contenders this year. Danny Cohen's Cinematography feels more appropriate and even more ambitious than his last outing with Hooper. It's a nomination that Cohen can easily capture. Paco Delgado's costumes are gorgeous and with his choices for Cosette and Marius' wardrobes, he'll stand out next to any contender this year at the Academy Awards. Chris Dickens' editing is fluid and in many ways is the reason the film succeeds so well.Tom Hooper's direction is what shines as he delivers zeal and intensity in his approach to bring every single actor and craftsman to their fullest potential. He's the conductor, composing in ways, his most personal work. He deeply cares about the story, music, and production. There are instances as the film engulfs you into the screen, where Les Miserables feels larger than life. A cautionary tale about revenge and redemption that could be the great musical structures this side of the world. Hooper respects the medium, appreciates and understands the narrative, and nurtures his performers like the father of cinema....Read more @ The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com)",9,0,2,5 January 2013
The Fountain," Too much water in the Fountain
","The Fountain Symbolism, metaphors, more symbolism, and more metaphors can't even begin to encompass Darren Aronofsky's The Fountain. Aronofsky helms the picture as if he were Pablo Picasso constructing his most personal portrait to date. Unfortunately, the director does not make things clear enough for the viewer and it took several conversations with a friend following the film to even grasp any concept of what this film was 'suppose' to be about. Aronofsky's heart is in the right place and it's very probable personal experience fueled his hand into writing this intimate portrayal of love and death, both lost and found.Trying to give a synopsis of the film is like trying to give the explanation of heaven and God. Spanning over a thousand years, the film tells three intertwined tales of love and our fragility of life in this world and the inevitable confrontation of it. Technically this film is an achievement on its own. Visually stunning from start to finish, the eclectic director who doesn't fail to surprise viewers or tap into something we haven't felt before like his previous works Requiem for a Dream and Pi; the film becomes so incredibly frustrating but at the end leaves you gasping for breath with its cunning, yet overwhelming finale.In 1500 AD Hugh Jackman portrays Tomas, a conquistador searching for the tree of life that God banished from the world in order to live forever with his Queen Isabel played by Rachel Weisz. In 2000, Jackman plays Tom Creo; a medical researcher whom is exceptionally gifted yet cannot seem to handle to concept of losing his very ailing wife, Izzy. Izzy is very charismatic and wise in her thoughts and words and has begun writing a personal symbolic fable to her husband. In 2500, a very cosmic and Yoga-like time to say the least, Jackman is some type of being standing by a tree having several visions of Izzy and talking repeatedly to the tree.Hugh Jackman gives his most impressive and broken performance to date. With his inner conflict and slow and steady realization of losing his wife, he shows us 'Wolverine' has more talent than ever anticipated. He delivers us three authentic and genuine characters whose tortured souls are evident in their actions. Rachel Weisz is restricted and reserved in her portrayal of the two women Izzy and Isabel. As Queen Isabel she exudes the grace of any Spanish Queen in the 15th century, although how Aronofsky allowed her to keep her British accent but is a Spanish Queen is beyond me. In present time, her American accent is on point and she has the same on-screen presence that carries Kate Winslet in her films. Critics and average viewers are constantly comparing the two but they are two of our finest actors working today that resemble each other in structure and performance.The idea that Aronofsky presented to the viewer was a thought provoking one, but not everyone will 'get' nor appreciate the picture. The visual spectacles are a marvel but the carry through wasn't smooth rather than being dragged through a thorn bush, screaming 'leave me alone, I don't want to know that badly.' The best parts of the film are Clint Mansell's potent score that always adds to the aura of Aronofsky's films. The cinematography is authentic and unique in pulling us through but leaves a rather dizziness in the system. And of course, Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz seem perfect for their roles. The screenplay however lacks very poor character development and not giving us enough background to fall in love with the couples. The director keeps us at a distance and doesn't invite us into their devotion to one another. The Oscar-Crystal ball tells this critic that some technical nominations may be in order but none other with the critics entirely split down the middle. You will either hate The Fountain or want to drink from it until your pores seep of love.Grade: **1/2/****",7,2,4,29 November 2006
The Departed," Scorsese's Best since 'Goodfellas'
","I'm very glad to say that this is his best achievement since 'Goodfellas' and the best of his career. 'The Departed' is a remake of the Hong-Kong film 'Infernal Affairs' which tells the story of two men, Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) whom are on two opposites sides of the law and seem to have their lives revolving around one of the most notorious gangsters, Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Billy comes from a family of mafia lords and crime smugglers however, seems to find his way into the honorable profession of law enforcement and wanting to make a difference. After his graduation from the academy, he is made an offer that involves getting entangled with the roots of his family and becoming the one thing he swore to fight against. He is discharged from the police and serves a one-year prison sentence and upon his departure, join the crowd of Costello made up of scandalous thugs and convicts, in order to gain information and evidence to convict the felon. But Costello has some tricks up his sleeve and his infamous nature is guarded by the inside of the commandment. Many years prior to Billy's infiltration, Costello befriends a young boy and makes him his own personal messenger and protégé, Colin Sullivan. Colin is well trained and Frank convinces him to join the Boston State Police as his source of crime and information. He tips Frank off for police operations while quickly moving his way up the ladder of success in the department. The two men accept their tasks and we are thrown into the ultimate story of corruption, deceit and loyalty. Billy Costigan is the most complex character thanks to the powerful performance by Leonardo DiCaprio. Billy has his own personal demons and is in constant battle within himself from his crimes with Costello to his loss of humanization. Billy seems to lose himself in the film and is in long search of redemption of his misdemeanors. DiCaprio is truly a gifted and talented actor and continues to show us that he isn't the same boy/heartthrob from 'Titanic,' his 'Billy' is perplexing and utterly haunting. DiCaprio's performance is the best of the cast but I'm afraid the role doesn't garner the much 'Oscar scene' to gather true awards attention. He does have some powerful clips although, they're a part of an action flick that few actors can seem to find their way out of and onto a short list called the Best Actor race. The film would need to be a unanimous hit for him to pull off nomination #3. His Boston accent is great and the fury that he finds in his character is remarkable. I just don't feel his character can be appreciated and admired the way it should be. Matt Damon has been trying to show us a different part of him each time. Colin is the most hated man of the film, hands down. From his manipulation of the law to his constant deceit and betrayal of his peers, Damon truly finds his character's axis. Colin Sullivan is greedy in power, arrogant in thoughts, and degrading in aura. The powerful and well put together screenplay elevates what could have been a very typical story and turns it into an action genre with slices of drama sequences that some films could only dream to be. The pace of the film is just right with all the right decisions being made. Scorsese builds scenes with so much suspense that it's terribly hard not to become knotted in the film and be at the edge of your seat. Jack, I believe is on his way to another nomination. Frank Costello is one of the most malevolent, immoral, sinful men of recent film history. Jack is the man and while he deserves the acclaim that he hopefully will receive for the role, he is in no way walking to the podium to accept a fourth Oscar. Even though he does many wicked things in the film, you start to admire the spirit and reputation of Frank Costello. He is the best put together player, head to toe, from his monologues about his past to his devilish humor; he chews scenery so well that he bleeds out the screen. There is no real reason to reiterate how great Jack is but it is great to see those sunglasses at the Kodak Theater from time to time. While the film is jammed packed with suspense and thrills, there is a huge flaw that befalls the film and it's its extremely weak ending. The film builds you up to a climax you cannot wait to see and experience but unfortunately, the end result is rather dull, flat and bland. While it didn't destroy the film entirely, it did enough damage to not make it a cinematic gem. Also, the entrance of Vera Farmiga's character as Madeleine, the police authority psychiatrist who starts to date Colin and ends up webbed in a love triangle with Billy is rather forced and unneeded. It's a bit too cheesy to suffice and the dramatic elements were enough without bringing in a tedious romance. What are 'The Departed' chances for the upcoming awards season? I'll say Jack Nicholson for supporting, the three-person writing team in the adapted screenplay category and a few technical nominations including sound, sound editing, editing and Howard Shore's potent score. Scorsese could find a spot in the Director's five but the film is too 'something' and I can't think of what it is yet but whatever it is there's an overabundance. The Globes will probably snap at the film because it's very reminiscent of Scorsese's previous works like 'Goodfellas' and 'Gangs of New York' but there's no Weinstein's to truly get it out there and appreciated. The film rips at you from inside and leaves a lucid impingement for all areas to be felt.",9,30,58,27 September 2006
Zero Dark Thirty," Boal and Bigelow do it again, now adding Chastain in their brilliance!
","Oscar-winning director Kathryn Bigelow and Oscar-winning screenwriter Mark Boal take their newest effort, Zero Dark Thirty, to places I couldn't have imagined. Based on the events leading up to the killing of Osama bin Laden, the two display an impressive amount of control in the way the film is told and showcases some brilliant moments in filmmaking. Zero Dark Thirty hooks you from minute one and just DOESN'T. LET. GO. It's one of the best pictures of the year!Starring Jessica Chastain as the beautiful and insightful Maya, she smoothly yet fiercely pulls you through the film delivering her best performance of her career so far. The film begins and ends with her and in the final scene, the Oscar mouths will be drooling. Chastain inhabits and constructs a character from scratch, inserting ticks and beats that only sweetens the execution. It's one of the year's best performances. Point blank.Accompanying her is the talented Jason Clarke, who's scene-stealing and at times comedic turn level out a very emotionally and demanding film. Kyle Chandler and Mark Strong make strong impressions in their minimal screen time and give even more evidence that Zero Dark Thirty is one of the best cast ensembles this year.The true star of the film is Mark Boal whose research, detail, and magnetic dialogue stands as the writer's finest work. The film creates such inner, moral dilemma and this is coming from someone who saw the World Trade Center fall at the tender age of 17. I witnessed evil that day and even with that, the film makes me ashamed to be an American. Revenge can run deep but what we witness in the film, is not revenge. You can't fight fire with fire. It's a dilemma Boal puts forth and one that will follow the viewer long after the film's end. It's pulse- pounding filmmaking and first-rate writing that should be studied for years to come. Bigelow's signature style doesn't come into full effect until the final thirty minutes but it will blow your socks off. The raid on the compound showcases heavenly camera work from Greig Fraser and commanding and sharp editing from Dylan Tichenor and William Goldenberg, two near sure-fire nominees for the Academy Awards. A well- placed Alexandre Desplat score only adds to the marvel of those final moments.Zero Dark Thirty is the best political thriller this decade. Mark my words. Oscar, your move!",10,7,40,5 January 2013
Steve Jobs," 'Jobs' Proves Fassbender and Winslet's Worth
","There are dozens of things to truly admire about Danny Boyle's new film 'Steve Jobs,' from its ambition to tell a compelling story about a famous man and the structure in which it decides to tell it. The initial casting of Academy Award nominee Michael Fassbender was criticized initially because some felt he was 'too good looking' to interpret a man, who was essentially a computer nerd. By the film's third sequence, Fassbender fully melts into the role and delivers one of his most visceral and intriguing performances to date. What's equally measured to his work is the talent and ferocity of Academy Award winner Kate Winslet, who falls into a sympathetic, determined woman, whose conscious is complicit in witnessing vile behavior. Aaron Sorkin's script is a multitude of words and one- liners, and is just plain smart in its dialogue exchanges between its characters. And finally, Boyle himself has never been more reserved in his direction, letting the words flow through the screen like a tractor trailer through a corn field. He sits on the sidelines, only letting instances of his vivacious direction show its head, which may or may not be a plus for Boyle enthusiasts. With all this said, it sounds like just a romp at the movies. Then why am I left underwhelmed by the final product?We have to begin with the story's narrative structure. Choosing three set pieces in 1984, 1988, and 1998 to show the progression of the film's characters was genius. We see a growth and progression to not just Steve Jobs, but the surrounding players in which are a part of his life. The film is jam-packed with wall-to-wall dialogue, something that is truly impressive to watch unfold in the moment, but hard to take in as key information and thoughts are being displayed. I needed some more beats, to take in, and disengage from the moment, to properly move on to the next. Its a movie that clearly needs two or three viewings to get everything from it. This may be its ultimate downfall. 'Steve Jobs' demands so much of its viewer. Our attention, dedication, and fearless endowment to the characters and the moment. I'm not entirely certain that general audiences can do that for 122 minutes. It becomes a double-edged sword. Is it okay that a movie such as this exists that will require us to give repeated participation to fully understand everything it has to say and reveal or does a film only deserve one shot to say everything it wants to say? I'm not sure I have a clear answer to that but I feel comfortable that general audiences members probably feel more towards the latter. Sorkin's work is compelling, with vibrantly preyed upon dialogue that simply sings through the theater. Its surely one of his most ambitious efforts of his career, and likely something that will forward his progression as a screenwriter, even in his later years.From a performance standpoint, the film stands near the top of ensembles and individualized works seen in 2015. Fassbender approaches Jobs with a familiarity, like he knows the man. He finds sarcasm to be a second language, and repugnancy to be a way of life. Boyle and Sorkin do very little to have Jobs redeem himself, as he continues to pile on immorality with repulsive, revolting behavior that may make you think twice before talking to 'Siri' ever again. I can't recall a Lead Actor candidate this unlikable in quite some time. It's a tour-de-force to behold, and one that will surely place near the top of Oscar ballots, but I'd be lying if I say I was looking forward to spending time with the character 'Steve Jobs' again.What Fassbender benefits immensely from, is a squad of supporting players, each making their individual mark. Winslet firmly plants her feet next to 'Jobs,' declaring herself as one of the finest actresses we have working today. Jeff Daniels as John Sculley is easily the most comfortable with the script's barrage of words. Daniels handles it with a defined purpose, delivering his best portrayal since 'The Squid and the Whale.' To a pleasant surprise, Seth Rogen as Steve Wozniak is tenderly inserted, and holding back all his normal tics and signature mannerisms that have made him a star. It's a welcomed entry into serious and challenging roles in the actor's future. Staggeringly underused but equally effective as each of her castmates is Katherine Waterston as Chrisann Brennan, Jobs' high-school girlfriend and 'possible mother' to his daughter, played by three talented child actresses, Makenzie Moss, Perla Haney-Jardine, and Ripley Sobo. The dynamic and vigorous Michael Stuhlbarg as Andy Hertzfeld is a sensation to watch, and will go down as one of the key players by a select group of movie-goers. Let's just call this a SAG Ensemble lock, shall we?Boyle's market for his bombastic colors and dance sequences are sure to miss them because they are non-existent. It's great to see him taking a different approach to his storytelling, though letting running text play a role should feel familiar for many. What I found dizzying was the camera work by Alwin H. Küchler, who in the spirit of 'Birdman,' has the audience constantly moving along with its constant walking characters. At one point, you want to just beg them to sit down and chill out for a second. Hats off to Elliot Graham's editing, who cuts to a commanding pace, even if more pauses would have been appreciated. What shines above all the technical merits is the score by Daniel Pemberton, orchestrating a symphony of music that swells in at the finest moments, and breathes new life into the work of composers everywhere. It was a truly remarkable piece of music that just flies off the screen.",7,18,41,5 October 2015
Crazy Heart," It's 'The Weary Kind' for Bridges that Soars...
","In his directorial debut, Scott Cooper adapts Thomas Cobb's Crazy Heart, the story of Bad Blake, a washed-up country star with an alcohol addiction. The film stars Jeff Bridges, in the lead role, and Maggie Gyllenhaal as Jean, a young reporter is taken in by Blake's heartache and pain.Cooper's direction is of subtle greatness. The film is quiet, slow-paced, but works. It's never meant to be loud or over-the-top, which some may be expecting; it's a beautiful written song about life thrust into a two-hour sympathy riot. Bridges, who will surely receive Oscar attention, is reserved, charismatic, and raw. Bridges' 58-year-old Blake is one of the better performances of the year. There are obvious comparisons to Robert Duvall's performance Tender Mercies, with critics believing a possibly similarity to Mickey Rourke's work in The Wrestler, which is certainly not the case, this is unique in its own way. Bridges doesn't overcook the role which would have been easy, he's effortless and sings quite well.Maggie Gyllenhaal, Oscar snubbed for her works in Sherrybaby and World Trade Center, is nearly average in her work. She's coy with Jean and underplays her, but unlike Bad Blake, her role doesn't call for it. Jean is a bruised, kindhearted, and devoted mother to her four-year old son Buddy (Jack Nation, as cute as can be), but uneven in narrative forming.Robert Duvall is brief, and nearly ineffectual. As the bar owner Wayne, he offers a humanity for Blake outside of woman, which is needed in the film, but in the end is unmemorable. Also sharing this boat is the talented Colin Farrell, who's both likable and adequate, but upstaged by scenes with Bridges.The only thing more beautiful than Bridges' performance is the song 'The Weary Kind,' which is submission for Best Original Song for the Academy Awards. This is one of the best songs written for a film in the last ten years. Delightful lyrics and exquisitely executed, the song one of the rare occasions of the perfect song for a perfect film, given the film's nature.While Crazy Heart doesn't offer anything insightful to the realm of cinema, it's simple, uncomplicated, and honest, which you can't appreciate. For a first time out, Cooper does an admirable job.***/****",7,106,144,4 December 2009
War of the Worlds," It's Not Out of the World
","Well let's see....War of the Worlds Is the most fun I had at the movies this year so far. The special effects are dazzling. The performances are pretty decent especially coming from a young Dakota Fanning and A-lister Tom Cruise.A few sites were spotting him for Oscar buzz but it looks like Tom will sit another year out. The entire film from beginning to end is all about one thing and one thing only....survival. There's no fancy story that will lead to Tom Cruise to fly a plane into the core mother ship or have a glass spill over onto a alien's shoulder that will melt him. It's just all about survival and a pretty realistic depiction of what might happen if aliens did invade.Spielberg tries to bring some heartfelt drama into the film but kind of falls short in that department. I guess we'll all have to wait for his Untitled 1972 Munich Olympics project which by the way still hasn't started filming but word has it, it will start very soon. The rest of the cast gives good performances; Tim Robbins as a psychopathic survivor seeking revenge. Miranda Otto has a pregnant angry ex-wife and a standout amongst the cast is Justin Chatwin who plays Tom Cruise's character's son. He has one big scene where it gets pretty emotional involving a father and son choosing two different paths when it comes to alien invasions.This film sparks up many discussions. Where would you run if aliens arrived? What would you tell your children? Would you want to fight? Would you sacrifice anyone who stood in the way of your survival? These are all questions that come up during the film and after. War of the Worlds was a good film worthy in all technical categories. In terms of a science fiction spot for the Oscars Best Picture race, I don't think they'll be one for it. Go see it is good fun.Grade: ***/****",6,0,1,19 May 2006
12 Years a Slave," McQueen's epic is beautiful and tragic anchored by sensational performances...
","Read More @ The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com)One of the things that have been thrown around for months now is the notion that awards season voting bodies won't respond to it because it's too 'difficult' to sit through. Let's define difficult, shall we? Is it difficult to see the first openly gay politician gunned down by his closeted colleague? Is it difficult to see a reformed convict put to death by our country for his crimes? Is it difficult to see a mother choose which one of her children dies during the Holocaust? I'd argue that these answers add up to a resounding yes. Yet, no one threw those phrases of 'too difficult' around.I've watched hundreds of films throughout my short 29-year history and I've seen some difficult cinema. Steven Spielberg's 'Schindler's List' can make anyone quiver in shame as it shows the despicable reality of the Holocaust. Paul Greengrass' 'United 93', which is almost an emotional biopic of America's darkest hour, makes me want to crawl up into a ball and cry. And finally, Mel Gibson's 'The Passion of the Christ', one of the highest grossing films of all-time, shows the labor of our sins fleshed out into the beaten skin of an honest man. And still, no one threw these hyperbolic terms out saying, 'it's too hard watch.' Is it because this is an American tragedy, done by Americans? Is it the guilt of someone's ancestors manifesting it in your tear ducts? I can't answer that. Only the person who says it can. The structure of this country is built on the backs and blood of slaves. But slavery didn't just exist in America, it was everywhere. It was horrifying what occurred for over 200 years and believe it or not, still exists in some parts of the world TODAY.Now when approaching the powerful film by McQueen and distributed by Fox Searchlight Pictures, there is a resounding honesty that McQueen and screenwriter John Ridley inhabit. There are no tricks or gimmicks, no cheap takes on a side story or character that is put there for time filling or a life-lesson for Solomon to learn. Everything is genuine. Is the film heartbreaking? Oh my God yes. Did I cry for several minutes after the screening? Embarrassingly so. I was enamored the entire time, head to toe, moment to moment.I have long admired the talent that's been evident in the works of Chiwetel Ejiofor. I've known he was capable of what he has accomplished as Solomon Northup and he hits it out of the park. He has the urgency, worry, and drive to get home to his family and executes every emotion flawlessly even when all hope seems to be lost. Where he shines incredibly are the small nuances that he takes as the story slows down, you notice aspects of Solomon that make him even more believable.As Edwin Epps, Solomon's last owner, Michael Fassbender digs down deep into some evil territory. Acts as the 'Amon Goeth' of our tale, he is exactly what you'd expect a person who believes this should be a way of life to behave. He's vile and strikes fear into not only the people he interacts with but with the viewers who watch. As Mrs. Epps, Sarah Paulson is just as wretched. Abusive, conniving, entitled, and I loved every second of her.Mark my words; Lupita Nyong'o is the emotional epicenter of the entire film. The heartache, tears, and anger that will grow inside during the feature will have our beautiful 'Patsey' at the core. She is the great find of our film year and will surely go on to more dynamic and passionate projects in the future. You're watching the birth of a star.Hans Zimmer puts forth a very pronounced score, enriched with all the subtle ticks that strike the chords of tone. One thing that cannot be denied is the exquisite camera work of Sean Bobbit. Weaving through the parts of boat and then through the grassroots of a cotton field, he puts himself in the leagues of Roger Deakins and Seamus McGarvey as one of the most innovative and exciting DP's in the business. Especially following his work in 'The Place Beyond the Pines' earlier this year. Simply marvelous.Oscar chances, since I know many of you are wondering. Put the Oscar's in my hands, you have a dozen nominations reap for the taking.

There's also a strong and rich sound scope that is present. The sounds of nature as the slaves walk or as Solomon approaches his master's house is noticed. The big question is, can it win? I haven't seen everything yet so I cannot yet if it deserves it or not. I can say, if critics and audiences can get off this 'difficult' watch nonsense and accept the cinematic endeavor as a look into our own history as told from a great auteur, there's no reason it can't top the night. I'm very aware that seeing this film along with Steve McQueen crowned by Oscar is nearly erasing 85 years of history in the Academy. Are they willing and ready to begin looking into new realms and allowing someone not necessarily in their inner circles to make a bold statement as McQueen and Ridley take in '12 Years a Slave?' I remain hopeful.",10,273,450,14 September 2013
Sausage Party," 'Sausage Party' Brings Raunchy Laughs and an Oscar Worthy Song
","Animation has never been such a fantastic blend of fun and dirty as seen in 'Sausage Party' from Sony Pictures. Created as the movie your perverted older brother made in high school but you can't help but love him for it, the definitely offensive but enthusiastically rapturous romp is the surprise hit of the summer.Directors Conrad Vernon and Greg Tiernan helm the ship that was written by Evan Goldberg, Seth Rogen, Kyle Hunter, and Ariel Shaffir with a steady hand as they play off social and racial stereotypes in the vein of something we would have seen on 'South Park.' Trickle in a talented voice cast that includes Rogen, Oscar nominees Kristen Wiig, Jonah Hill, James Franco, Edward Norton, and Salma Hayek, and you got a formula for something downright hilarious.'Sausage Party' takes no prisoners as the profanity and graphic nature makes an educated film-goer wonder 'how the hell did this just get an 'R' rating from the MPAA?' Shock value will bubble to the brim and likely spill over as we see food make sexual advances, dirty and used condoms interact with a smaller hotdog, and an orgy that might manage to trump any movie in the last 15 years.Taking the 'Toy Story' premise and asking the question, what if food could talk? 'Sausage' gives its characters a dynamic range of emotions as they mix in the very questions of today that marry the ideas of religion, purpose, and tolerance. I'm sure somewhere deep in the bones of every Pixar writer in the world, they've wanted to make THIS kind of movie. Why wouldn't they? The animation is tenderly bright and vibrant, creating a world of chaos but clarity. They work through the material with a bold and fearless nature that the Academy Awards would feel so lucky to be included among their Animated Feature nominees in 2017.Stepping outside the box with a raunchy song, Alan Menken's compositions and work stand just as high as anything delivered this year so far. Vivaciously alive in every beat, you can't help but smile ear to ear as the party rolls on. I'd surely say Menken is the hunt for an Oscar nomination in Original Song.The rest of the voice works of Bill Hader, Michael Cera, Danny McBride, Craig Robinson, Paul Rudd, and ESPECIALLY Nick Kroll are purely delightful.This is not the movie for Mom, unless your mother is awesome in every way. This is not the movie for your kids, because I can't wait to hear the headlines of the general audience goers that brought their kids to see thinking it was just a 'cute cartoon.' This is not the movie for your sophisticated movie friend because he or she is probably going to call you dumb for laughing at the jokes. This IS the movie for the Friday night, bring your girlfriend or boyfriend, watch their jaws drop, and enjoy the company of just plain old fun at the movies.",8,21,46,11 August 2016
Whiplash," A pair of outstanding performances by Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons embody Damien Chazelle's piece of perfection...
","When it comes to cinema, there are often little gems in a sea of bigger spectacles, that can break through in the most proficient way. Last year, I pleaded to the entire film universe that discover and understand 'Inside Llewyn Davis' from the Coen Brothers after seeing it for the first time at NYFF. This year, I've seem to already come to terms that the next film that will utilize all my energy and resources this year will be Damien Chazelle's highly intense psychological drama 'Whiplash.' An impeccable and tightly wound experience that brings your anxiety to a feverish level. As small, and utterly different as I'm about to compare, I haven't felt this uneasy with a film's tension since Paul Greengrass' 'Captain Phillips,' coincidentally also was a NYFF title. Two other similar traits that embody the two are the intense and completely submersible performances that inhabit them. Stars Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons are absolutely astonishing, featuring two of the year's very best turns.Chazelle's film tells the story of Andrew (Teller), a first year music student that seeks out and joins the prestigious school band, headed by an intense and frightening teacher Mr. Fletcher (Simmons).Walking out of the screening I fully knew (though I fully hope to be proved wrong this year) that Miles Teller would be my 'Oscar Isaac' this year. A performance that should shoot to the top of any awards consideration for a lead actor, but unfortunately will be passed over show after show. Teller is submerged in a way that we haven't seen the young actor achieve at this stage in his career. After plowing onto the scene opposite Nicole Kidman in 'Rabbit Hole,' and then helming 'The Spectacular Now' with complete ease and intensity, I was not expecting him to be the machine of fury and magnitude that is on display in 'Whiplash.' There are moments where he channels the emotional aura of performances like Tom Hulce/F. Murray Abraham in 'Amadeus,' as crazy as that sounds. I am so excited to see where Teller goes from here. It makes the future of film a lot more bright, knowing that someone like him will be rising up in the ranks.Everything you've heard about J.K. Simmons is true and then some. A fully fleshed out supporting role, Chazelle doesn't write Fletcher as a caricature. He's a deeply acute individual, full of passion and acrimony. Chazelle doesn't keep Simmons at a '10,' he and Simmons allow him to find a range of empathy, hatred, and cryptic allowances that will keep you at the edge of your seat. As I watched Simmons flesh out a performance that can only be described as magnificent, I kept coming back in my mind to Christoph Waltz in the Oscar-winning 'Inglourious Basterds,' a role that found much heat on the awards circuit. The world/all film lovers will not be able ignore the stunning presence of Simmons. A Supporting Actor nominations (maybe even a win) seems all but assured (and deserved). Looking back at the veteran actor's career that included memorable roles in 'Juno,' 'Burn After Reading,' and 'Up in the Air,' a role like this could not have come at a better time. Already impressive in his brief work in Jason Reitman's 'Men, Women & Children,' writers, directors, casting agents, and producers will be pounding on the actor's door.You can't credit 'Whiplash' without citing the words and control by writer/director Damien Chazelle. An amazing and outstanding sophomore effort (unfortunately have not seen his debut 'Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench') that channels a young Bennett Miller. Vigorous, self-assured, and innovative, Chazelle is a brilliant auteur filmmaker that knows exactly what type of films he wants to make. He takes inspiration from his own life, his love of film and music, and other places I'm sure we don't know about, and molds them into a gritty, layered experience, conditioned with rich characters, all realized through the writer's story. It's one of the best scripts of the year.'Whiplash' features some of the best minutes of film seen in 2014. An ending that will bring tears to your eyes, dual performances that will have you applaud, and an experience that you surely will not forget. Drumming has never felt like such a personality. It acts as a visible tool for the viewer to understand and try. If you love music, appreciate education, and dare to be better than your current state, you will find something very real to latch onto. Hold on, and hold on tight.'Whiplash' is being distributed by Sony Pictures Classics and will be released October 10 in limited release (and then expanding after). A must-see for all movie lovers!",9,167,258,27 September 2014
The Wolf of Wall Street," The Wolf of Wall Street is Leonardo DiCaprio's Crowning Work
","Martin Scorsese has done it again. His newest and most refreshing effort he's contributed to the world of cinema in years, The Wolf of Wall Street is a roaring thrill ride that is both absolutely hilarious and meticulously constructed. It also presents Academy Award nominee Leonardo DiCaprio in possibly his finest acting performance of his career. At one-minute shy of three hours, I was both engaged and hypnotized nearly the entire duration. A comedic epic that studies the behavior and cultures of a time in America, feels like the uncovering of a time capsule that was buried and dug up to give insight into our current financial crisis. Much more than just laughs, it turns on the dramatic elements early enough in the film to warrant considerable reactions about the choices of our key characters. Expertly paced with intelligent moral questions presented, The Wolf of Wall Street is one of the best films of the year.Telling the story of Jordan Belfort, a young Wall Street broker that gets involved in drugs, money, and even more drugs during the 80's and 90's. In his tenure trading (and stealing), Jordan marries, divorces, does drugs, marries again, does even more drugs, makes solid friendships, and believe it or not, does a lot more drugs. Watching the destruction of Jordan acted as a documentarian's insight that felt like I was watching 'Intervention' without the family that cares. The Wolf of Wall Street is a black comedy, giving hints of drama. Natural comparisons will fly to Oliver Stone's Wall Street which is accurate but you can see subtle hints of films like Trading Places, Glengarry Glen Ross, and even American Psycho. That's a testament to Scorsese's outstanding direction and Terence Winter's masterful screenplay. Scorsese keeps Wolf life-size, sprinkled with characters that are both geniuses and morons, but functioning morons. They're like the frat pack group that sat in a corner on my college campus, being loud and obnoxious, and made terrible life choices that they still aren't aware of until this day. Scorsese puts together an all-star cast to inhabit these beings that includes DiCaprio, Jonah Hill, Margot Robbie, Matthew McConaughey, Jon Bernathal, and Kyle Chandler. All of which seem to be having the time of their lives.A lot of the credit of the film's overall success has to be awarded to Leonardo DiCaprio. I've never seen him truly 'go for it' in a way that he exhibits as Jordan Belfort. In his breaking of the fourth wall, to his long but completely engaging monologues about life, money, and greed, it's the most assured and compelling work by the actor to date. When DiCaprio unleashed his talents in the mid-90's in What's Eating Gilbert Grape? and later stole the hearts of tween girls everywhere in Titanic, who knew this is the role he'd been gearing up to play. This is the role of his career and something that the Academy Awards should look to for his long overdue recognition. It's a charming and adventurous turn that presents a conundrum to the audience as we find ourselves both enamored and loathing the pure essence of Jordan. A sequence of DiCaprio crawling on the floor will probably be the scene of the year. This is DiCaprio's crowning achievement.As the magnetic and cheesy-minded right-hand man, Jonah Hill's performance as Donnie Azoff is another great turn for the 30-year-old actor. He's allowed to explore some of his comedic ticks and beats that he may not have ever had the opportunity to explore in films like Superbad or 21 Jump Street. In Wolf, he relies on his own instincts, and his chemistry with DiCaprio, which has helped him before for his Oscar-nominated work in Moneyball opposite Brad Pitt. Matthew McConaughey, is one scene shy of winning the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. While his work in Dallas Buyers Club will bring him the acclaim and recognition that he deserves, The Wolf of Wall Street is a prime example of what he should be doing when he's not working or seeking out the strong, independent features that are geared for awards recognition. Stealing every frame and focus from DiCaprio in his ten minute screen time, McConaughey utilizes all his charm and spunk as Mark Hanna, the mentor to young Jordan as he started out.Like any great Scorsese film, the women are in full-force and given the opportunity to shine like the others. Cristin Millotti, a toned down and tragic version of Marisa Tomei in My Cousin Vinny, is sensational in her brief appearances on screen. Beautiful and sympathetic, she offers much needed serious and dramatic elements to Jordan's outrageous antics. In the end, a star is born in the gorgeous and vivacious Margot Robbie as Naomi Lapaglia, Jordan's second wife. Whoever was going to be cast as Naomi, had to be an actress of considerable talent and had the ability to really be the sexy kitten but still warrant an emotional reaction from the audience when called upon. Margot Robbie was the perfect choice and she'll need to owe Scorsese royalties for years to come with the roles she'll be offered following this. Robbie is pure magic and is everything she's required to be. She's the more elusive, compelling, and more thought out version of Scarlett Johansson's character in Don Jon.I loved every second of The Wolf of Wall Street. Terence Winter's script is a natural and well-oiled machine that produces the words of a demigod. You couldn't make these things up. Thelma Schoonmaker is the utmost professional and continues to shine film after film. You won't find another dedicated and glossed editing work this year. The other supporting actors do sensational work especially Kyle Chandler, who has a very well-constructed exchange on a boat with DiCaprio, has us asking more and more, why is this guy not helming his own films on a consistent basis yet?",9,504,845,17 December 2013
American Gangster," An American Tale: Washington goes East
","Director Ridley Scott brings to the screen, American Gangster, the true story of Frank Lucas, the notorious drug smuggler during the 60s and 70s revolutionized the drug industry. Oscar winner Steven Zaillian writes the crime piece but doesn't provide the viewer with enough fuel to launch the film off the ground. The countdown to take off was great and then the viewer stayed stagnant with the engines going for nearly forty-five minutes before the rocket took off. All the dialogue seemed too forced and too aggressive to engage us into the film. It was like a five year old telling us to 'Watch this, watch this.' Alright Mr. Scott and Mr. Zaillian, I'll watch just stop telling me to do so. I think there was too much anticipation built up into a mediocre storyline.Academy Award winner Denzel Washington stars as Lucas bringing forth a candy cane version of his 'Alonzo' in Training Day. As the ferocious Frank, Washington manages to inherit all the fury and anger of a troubled young individual yearning for success and leave his inhibitions at the door. As a terrific turn for the veteran actor Washington does an admiral job on a character we hardly know and introduces him to us full force. How can Washington manage to be so good and make all this seem effortless? Beats me, but the fact that it looks so easy and the character doesn't demand too much of Washington may be his undoing in this upcoming awards season. While a nomination isn't out of the question, with two wins to his credit, this performance holds no measure to his previous works. Zaillian was unsure how malicious he wanted to portray Lucas and ended up portraying him as incredibly unsure of himself and how he wanted to be. But maybe that's the character and Scott just failed to let us know.Russell Crowe plays Detective Richie Roberts, a narcotics cop battling more than the drug war on the streets of New York. The monotone detective never lets Crowe break out of his exterior tough demeanor. A big star like Crowe definitely takes on this supporting turn with a sense of humility and that perhaps is the triumph of the performance. With big starring turns in Gladiator, Cinderella Man, and A Beautiful Mind, I would never expect Crowe to take on such a quiet role and do it with dignity. An impressive turn but doesn't have the pivotal scene that one actor yearns for that steals any scene.With 90% of the film having Washington and Crowe separated, the anxious and satisfying meeting in the finale settled all tension built up throughout the film's narrative. Ridley Scott seems on the back burner of this picture as he allows his stars to run the show. The supporting cast even shows some brightness off and on.It's Ruby Dee as Mama Lucas that capitalizes on her limited screen time. As a veteran actress she does have the power and potential to break into the extremely weak Supporting Actress race. She shows vulnerability yet an intense courage that evokes the audience when she's on screen.Josh Brolin's exciting and villainous turn as a crooked cop turns out to be a strong turn for the actor who is having one hell of a year with an acclaimed turn in No Country for Old Men. Chiwitel Ejifor has a presence in a film that is soothing but doesn't flow with the characters he chooses. He might be Hollywood's best kept secret at the moment with the wrong roles.In the end, American Gangster may not have enough steam to jump into the Best Picture race. With Scott being so 'overdue' for a Oscar, that may the film's only hope. With comparisons be thrown around to The Departed, (which doesn't measure by a mile) last year's winner, the film already has an uphill climb ahead. Serious potential for Washington and Dee for this year's Oscar race. The film is enjoyable but tries too hard to start off with a bang and ends up leaving the viewer disenchanted and we spend too much of the premise trying to play catch up.Grade: ***/****",7,1,7,2 November 2007
Stranger Than Fiction," Nothing Strange, Completely Familiar
","Stranger than Fiction The comparisons are flying around the net and papers to Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind but let it be known that Marc Foster's Stranger than Fiction is a remarkable cinematic achievement in its own. It does have that Charlie Kaufman-like feel to it but captures the heart at a vulnerable point in its rising action. The film tells the story of Harold Crick, a thirty-something IRS agent that lives his life one second to the next. From brush strokes to calculating equations, Harold's life has become a very secluded one. Meanwhile, Kay Eiffel is a successful author that hasn't published a book in ten years and is in a serious case of writer's block. Along with her assistant, Penny the two search for inspiration to complete Kay's latest work which ironically is telling Harold's current life. At first it's just talking about things that he is doing, which keeps Harold inside the realm of Kay's narration. But when Kay mentions Harold's 'inevitable death' Harold's transformation and search begins.This film is by far the best performance this viewer has seen Will Ferrell. As awkward as he is touching, Ferrell elevates the material and does a transformation that comedians like Jim Carrey have had trouble doing for some time. His Harold is completely alive to the audience and touches the most personal parts of the soul. Not since tales such as Cinderella Man, Million Dollar Baby, and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind have I cared so dearly about a character. If justice were to be served Ferrell would be a serious contender to such a weak category called Best Actor but in all seriousness, is the Academy ready to have him come to the Oscars? Maybe, he is a voter now and the season is just beginning.Emma Thompson's haunting portrayal of a suicidal author should garner a few raves. Thompson has been popping in and out of good films lately, (Harry Potter, Love Actually, Angels in America) and seems poised for a nice comeback to the Oscars. Again, another weak category could welcome her back and along with Ferrell could train ride the both of them to the Kodak.The rest of the supporting cast is magnificent. Dustin Hoffman is still chewing some of his comedic elements beautifully. Queen Latifah is showing her range despite how small the role is. And Maggie Gyllenhaal is having a fantastic year but in Fiction she is the sexiest and authentic I have ever seen her. Foster also has great control of his picture and never loses sight of Helm's message. He drives the film to a wonderful destination of oddity and elusiveness of the narrative.Aside from the the beautiful screenplay by Zach Helm, the score is probably one of the strongest points adding to an eerie, yet completely volatile moving picture. Consideration if there is going to be any, should focus on the powerful screenplay that carries that 'who thinks of that?' feeling and Ferrell and Thompson powerhouse performances. If it were up to me however, this would be a definite Best Picture contender for its originality and heartfelt humor. This film could change your complete outlook of your existence.Grade: ****/****",10,1,2,27 November 2006
The Reader," Reads into a Strong Ending
","Director Stephen Daldry and writer David Hare have one of the greatest chemistry's of any writer-director I've witnessed. Going back to their ambitious effort, The Hours which would fail to win any other Oscar outside of Nicole Kidman's staggering performance. However, The Reader, their newest efforts have proved to be much lighter and even less impressive of works of 2008. The film stars a wonderful ensemble of actors; starting with the beautiful Kate Winslet in her most 'bare,' to say the least we've seen her in her career, who gives a valiant effort portraying Hanna, the woman with a dark past and even darker future. Winslet's performance here, while not surpassing her work in Revolutionary Road earlier this year, should see herself as an Oscar nominee this upcoming season. David Kross who plays Michael, the object of Hanna's affection at fifteen years old, is solid and gives a courageous breakthrough performance which should make him one to watch in later years.Ralph Fiennes, as the elder Michael is utterly heartbreaking. Making us aware of how great he has been in the past and still continues to wow us in his later years, he really shows versatility here. We hope he doesn't remain one of Oscars best kept secrets who continues to go unnoticed through time. Lena Olin, in a brief, yet strikingly igniting role, does what she can in such minimal time.David Hare's screenplay however, doesn't provide enough character depth to hold us to the story. All are pretty much a mystery and undeniably in agony but we really don't care why. Daldry's direction holds pace but takes a while to pick up steam. The last third of the film is where it really comes alive but the journey there is quite uneventful.Collectively, The Reader is a solid work yet noticeably flawed but always worth the watch.***/****",7,2,4,8 January 2009
Inception," Inception is Nolan's Best Write Yet...
","Christopher Nolan blazed on to the scene in 1998 with his film Following. Depending on who you are or how much of a Nolan enthusiast you are, you might have seen his first work, Doodlebug from the year before. Nolan's newest and probably most cleverly written film Inception, has Nolan exploring his own head and dimensions since his 1998 work. It's incredible how this writer/director has made such a name for himself in such a short period of time. Although all his works aren't magnificent (Insomnia being not one of his finest), he places a stamp and an edge on each of his works that makes the film completely recognizable as a Nolan film. Just look at his little film called The Dark Knight.Inception doesn't rip off other films that are likely to be the comparisons like The Matrix, it reinvents a genre and almost recreates it as if we're seeing it for the first time. The synopsis was a big secret coming down to opening day and I did my very best to not know what the film was about. I'm proud to say I succeeded, and I will continue to respect any person who hasn't seen the picture yet and wants to remain in the dark. If people see the trailer or poster, you'll know it has something to do about dreams. That's a spot on description I might say.The performances are not stand out, loud, or boisterous to be considered Oscar threats in the race for 2010 but they're accessible, respectable, and all deliver some great work. Star of the film Leonardo DiCaprio performs top notch and has landed himself into a great place as one of the best working actors in Hollywood. He's unstoppable as the tortured character 'Cobb' and what his work does here is improve his chances at Oscar consideration, the question is what film will they embrace, this, or his earlier magnificent performance in Martin Scorsese's Shutter Island.One of the best things about the film, besides Nolan's impeccable writing style, is his choice of constructing the best cast ensemble of the year so far. Supporting players are all on their A-game, showing charisma and emotional depth. The player most worthy and in the hunt for an Oscar nomination is Academy Award Winner Marion Cotillard who remains beautiful as ever but delivers her most terrifying portrayal yet. 500 Days of Summer star Joseph Gordon-Levitt has just made himself one of the coolest actors in Hollywood. His action scenes are the most dynamic and entertaining which makes him one of the more likable actors of the film. Ellen Page is fun, satisfying, and sufficient. Page has long left her Juno work behind her and is moving forward to be a more progressive and challenging actress. It's always so good to see Oscar nominee Ken Watanabe still working and showing great work. His breakthrough role in Edward Zwick's The Last Samurai was in serious danger of being his one-hit wonder, but he shows he's here for a while. Tom Hardy, star of last year's explosive British film, Bronson, has just established himself in the states of a capable and competent performer. Hardy is the topping on this sweet, sweet cake of a film. Cillian Murphy, like always, keeps his character at a distance from the viewers, only allowing us to see what he wants us to see. Murphy is the secret greatness in Inception. Dileep Rao (James Cameron's Avatar), Michael Caine (Oscar Winner for The Cider House Rules), Pete Postlethwaite (Oscar nominee, Jim Sheridan's In the Name of the Father), and Tom Berenger (Oscar nominee, Oliver Stone's Platoon) are all added surpluses.Technical work here is breathtaking including Wally Pfister's incredible Cinematography, Lee Smith's perfect Editing, and Hans Zimmer's sensational score are the three most likely Oscar contenders and feasible frontrunners. Sound and Visual crew are right there and close behind to land themselves in serious contention.But again, enough can't be said about Christopher Nolan. I see him finally holding an Oscar this year for his writing work here and I wouldn't count him out for a Directing bid either. He's in top form and with a Best Picture category expanded to ten, this is a film the fans and 'regular' audiences can get behind to boost Oscar ratings.Inception is sensational. The second best of the year (depending on who you are, Toy Story 3 may have this beat by a smidge) and Christopher Nolan's best screenplay of his career.",9,2,7,26 July 2010
WALL·E," WALL-E, the most innovative animated film in years...
","Animation is a key element in the lives of children but somewhere around adolescence, a young person feels they're 'too mature' or 'too cool' to be watching 'cartoons.' Then a change occurs in adulthood, which the same young person misses something from their childhood and a film they watched while playing with Lego's brings them back to that. As of late, animated films have tried to be something their not, perhaps lost their spark. In the new millennium, I haven't really experienced the Bambi, The Lion King, or The Fox and the Hound of our time. Finding Nemo and The Incredibles raised the bar but still hadn't been the perfect dose of entertainment, writing, and emotion. WALL-E, has achieved where its predecessors failed.WALL-E is the most touching, real, emotionally moving film this year so far. The film is about a little robot named WALL-E, (Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class) who has become exceptionally lonely on the desolate planet of Earth, that has become a wasteland of filth, debris, and pollution. Life has ceased to exist on the once populated planet until a rocket lands and drops off a 'surprise,' to say the least. Enters our heroin, which might be an understatement, EVE, a robot with an edge, that is searching for 'something' that might be the key to life's existence. But alas, WALL-E falls in love with her charm, wit, and blaster gun and when circumstances force her to be picked up, WALL-E will travel across the galaxy to find his love.WALL-E makes a statement loud and clear about today's political factors, from pollution to exercise, love, life, it speaks of it all in volumes without any words; it uses images to baffle the viewer as we are thrust through the film. Writer and Director Andrew Stanton creates wonderful details as we are engulfed into WALL-E's world and within seconds of the film starting, fall in completely in love with the robot.The film doesn't pretend to be something it's not and Stanton isn't afraid to let the film be both for the mature and the innocence of our youth. With limited dialogue, Stanton takes a chance of losing his viewers but rest assured, there is never a dull moment and while the film does lose a little flavor from the start, resonance of childhood and contentment fill the viewer in images of awe and splendor.As the already declared by many, Animated Film frontrunner of the Academy Awards, the film studio Pixar may have a winner on its hands to make a strong push for Best Picture. Not since Beauty and the Beast has an animated film been nominated for Best Picture and we've had some potential candidates over the years. But with the induction of the Best Animated Feature category, voters feel there's no need to validate the films twice so to speak. WALL-E is technically beautiful which makes it a contender in the Sound and Editing categories, and Stanton is more than just the writer of the film as he directs the film with power and precise. I'd go so far as to say this is the best directed animated film I've ever seen. That is where Stanton's magic is, his direction, but writing is definitely a strong suit for the film as well. We'll have to wait for the upcoming awards season to see how it plays out.But go and catch WALL-E on the big screen, and enjoy the masterpiece for what it is and the wonderful short film at the beginning of the film which is a treat for all.***½/****",9,6,10,30 June 2008
Arrival," 'Arrival' Is a Masterclass in Filmmaking With Amy Adams Magnified
","The science fiction genre has evolved into some of the most prolific imagery and storytelling of the silver screen. Denis Villeneuve's splendid 'Arrival' has the foreign director taking on uncharted territory and putting forth his finest film of his career yet.Starring Academy Award nominee Amy Adams, 'Arrival' tells the story of unidentified spacecrafts that enter the earth's atmosphere. Just hovering over the ground in dozens of locations around the world, it is up to a linguist and a scientist to break the language barrier and find out if their intentions are honorable or hostile.Natural comparisons will emerge to Christopher Nolan's 'Interstellar,' and while that film's ambition was generally accepted and positive, 'Arrival' taps into something Nolan's film only hoped to achieve. The exquisite class in which Villeneuve's film exists is such a daunting and audacious triumph. Eric Heisserer's script may at first feel familiar, perhaps too much so, as the first half of the film seems like the same foundation we saw with Alfonso Cuaron's 'Gravity.' When the story is turned on itself in a soft and credible fashion, 'Arrival' opens itself up as one of the year's most brilliant feats.With performances that have spanned a vast net of quirky and strong supporting players (i.e. 'Junebug' and 'The Fighter'), Amy Adams has emerged as a fully realized leading lady. While some will attest her previous lead roles in 'Enchanted' and to a lesser extent 'American Hustle' as proof that she's already mounted this campaign, discovering what she does here will make you change your perception. She is a talented artist, sensitive and endowed with the tools of a legendary actress. It is a beautiful work.Co-stars Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker are served well in their minimal roles. As the slick but engaged scientist, Renner approaches his role with the utmost candor. Whitaker, as an army leader, is blunt, honest and frank – everything you would want in anyone playing a character such as this.Cinematographer Bradford Young is utterly suave in his usage with the lens. Already capturing our hearts with his works on 'Selma' and 'A Most Violent Year,' Young's glossy and poised framework is not only exciting, but visually moving.For the third year in a row, composer Johann Johansson raises the bar for nearly all creators of the musical language. 'The Theory of Everything' and 'Sicario' were just the beginning for him. He mounts an orchestra of vast sensations. The sentiment of each scene is built within Johansson's response to the words on screen. He not only has respect for the visual works being created, he compliments the details in which the expressions and languages endure. It's another Oscar-worthy work that will undoubtedly bring him another nomination.'Arrival' is a film that can seem bigger than itself. Perhaps it's even 'too smart.' However, movies should challenge the viewer. The stamina of a film rests on its tenacity and persistence to dare the viewer to explore new thoughts and feelings. 'Arrival' achieves just that. It is a film that should be noted in multiple Oscar categories and revered by all except the most impudent viewer. This film is not to be missed.GRADE: (★★★★)",9,1,5,19 February 2017
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Using the 'M' Word Again...Masterpiece!
","I think we've all been exceptionally good this year because Christmas came early with Alejandro González Iñárritu's masterful 'Birdman (or the Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance),' an experience that you won't soon forget. Debuting at Venice and Telluride Film Festivals, the film closed an already impeccable New York Film Festival on Saturday morning for press and industry colleagues. It's a film that resonates profoundly, and may just be the best film of 2014. From its pristine writing (by Iñárritu, Armando Bo, Nicolas Giacobone, and Alexander Dinelaris), to its carefully constructed direction and cinematography, to its genius casting and performances, 'Birdman' is just a dream of a movie.The movie tells the story of Riggan (Michael Keaton), a washed up actor who used to play a superhero icon called Birdman. In a valiant attempt to reclaim his career, he adapts, directs, and stars in a Broadway play. With problems from one of his very method actors (Edward Norton), assistant daughter (Emma Stone), emotional co-star (Naomi Watts), overly sexual girlfriend (Andrea Riseborough), flamboyant producer (Zach Galifanakis), and loving ex- wife (Amy Ryan), Riggan prepares for the breaking point of his career.'Birdman' is so damn enjoyable and one of the most entertaining films in years. It charms not just because of its story, but because of the performances and slick way that co-writer/director Iñárritu plays with tone. It's downright hilarious in parts, probably the funniest film of the year, and then there's the dramatic edge that comes into play, and simply breaks your heart. Above all, Iñárritu's 'Birdman' is a celebration of cinema. It's an audacious achievement that floors just about every aspect of film witnessed in 2014. Iñárritu already had vocal admirers from 'Amores Perros,' 'Babel,' and 'Biutiful,' but this is his most accessible. This will move him up in the ranks with the Scorsese's, Spielberg's, and Eastwood's. He familiarizes us with the stage and the theater. He makes the surroundings a very palpable character for us to know and enjoy. At 63, Michael Keaton has been criminally underutilized in his career, despite some iconic performances. The nerd crowd will worship him as the ideal Bruce Wayne/Batman combo, while the same thick will remember his 'Beetle Juice' fondly for all-time. Where Keaton was passed over was for his dramatic capabilities. I've beat the horse dead on mentioning his cancer-stricken father-to-be performance in 'My Life' or his recovering alcoholic player in 'Clean and Sober.' In 'Birdman,' Keaton marries the two with an undeniable sensibility that stands as the actor's finest to date. It's such a studied turn, you feel the accuracy and precision in which he executes every move and mannerism of Riggan. It's the role that Keaton has been waiting decades for. It's the role of his career.If we're talking about underutilized actors, then Edward Norton needs to be mentioned. Two brilliant performances under his belt, both Oscar-nominated ('Primal Fear' and 'American History X') but both passed over for someone else, Norton is back and better than ever. A scene-stealing standout, Norton makes us realize how unspoken dialogue between characters can be just as humorous without the punchline. Emma Stone has finally arrived with 'Birdman.' Criminally misused and passed over by Hollywood for 'bigger name' actresses, Stone finally shows the world what they've been missing. In one single scene, Stone revolutionizes and captures the essence of 'Birdman' with a ferocity that you couldn't see from any other performer. She finds the heart and soul of Sam, laying her on the screen meticulously and transparent. Though brief in screen time, the vivacious Naomi Watts, the sexy Andrea Riseborough, and the seasoned Amy Ryan make their marks exquisitely. Watts gets the most chuckles out of the ladies while Ryan has the greatest arc for us to explore. I hope and pray that Zach Galifianakis continues down a path in independent cinema. Fully realized and delivered, he layers the film with a beautiful sympathy, vocal and restrained, he finds the meaning of Riggan and presents him to us.Emmanuel Lubezki. That is a sentence, statement, and just pure cinematic meaning nowadays. You can't watch a movie shot by the Academy Award winning Cinematographer and not find yourself more intimately contained and available to the realm of the movies. Just one year after stunning us with 'Gravity,' Lubezki allows the audience to be in the movie. We are present in every scene, every movement, and every thought that a person is having. We feel as though Riggan and the cast are interacting with us. When they're laughing, we're laughing, when they're crying, we're crying. He is an absolute magician. This seems to be the year of the drums because Antonio Sanchez composes 'Birdman' with a drum score that lays deep in my ear canals. Tapping your feet and bobbing your head, Sanchez elevates the film to new heights. Editors Douglas Prise and Stephen Mirrione may be the unsung heroes because in the film, we are nearly in one continuous take, which hardly ever gives up (at least to the untrained eye). In no way do I call myself someone who can spot a digital edit, but I spotted no more than a dozen cuts throughout. That is amazing. I'm sure there were dozens more, but you couldn't catch them.'Birdman' is a masterpiece (there goes THAT word). At a time where movies feel like they have to choose to between comedy and tragedy, Iñárritu's beauty works on us from the inside-out. It's a human story, comedy, thriller, mystery, all rolled into one. All told by a master filmmaker and storytellers. The year's must-see experience.",10,516,994,13 October 2014
Halloween," The Great Horror Film of History (***½)
","There is no horror film more sinister or more brilliant than that of John Carpenter's Halloween. Released October 25, 1978, Carpenter's film went on gross more than $47 million dollars, making it the eighth highest grossing film of the year. The film tells the haunting tale of Michael Myers, a 21 year old man who fifteen years earlier, murdered his 17 year old sister Judith on Halloween night after she finished having sex. At six years old, Michael was placed in a mental institution where Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance) becomes his primary psychiatrist. Dr. Loomis however, sees a darkness in Michael that can't be explained. He spent a few years attempting to get through to him and the rest trying to keep him locked up. On Halloween 1978, Michael escapes and goes on a murder rampage through Haddonfield, Illinois attempting to get to his one last blood relative Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis). Forget Rob Zombie's version of the franchise and forget the mediocre sequels that followed the 1978 hit (actually, Halloween II is pretty awesome as well), Carpenter's original set the bar for all 'scary' movies that would follow but never measure. Carpenter's handle of the film is smart, innovative, and pulse pounding. Prior to this film, Carpenter had only had two full length features under his belt, Assault on Precinct 13 (1976) and Dark Star (1974). Halloween put Carpenter on the map.One of Jamie Lee Curtis' very first roles... While the screenplay by Carpenter and Debra Hill is the A-typical cheese-fest that horror films offers, the acting of Curtis and Pleasance are some of the best work seen in this genre. Granted, the bar hasn't been raised too high in this regards, but it's a notable mention. Nick Castle, who actually portrays Myers in his adult, jump suited, William Shatner mask wearing sociopath shape controls an aura that spits out of the screen and sets your fears ablaze. Michael Myers is hands down the creepiest, most terrifying film killer in my memory. Put Chucky in front of me, I'd kick him across the room. Put Freddy in my dreams, I'll laugh myself awake. Put Jason in front of me, I'd take him to Central Park ice skating rink and do a triple axle on his face. Put Michael Myers in front of me, give me a new diaper; I just went on myself. No question about it. The most famous aspect of the film, and nearly the franchise, is the outstanding score constructed by John Carpenter himself. Never has a score been so identifiable or synonymous with a character or genre. If you've lived under a rock all these years or haven't had the stomach to face the franchise, take a night, introduce yourself to Michael and see how the horror genre was meant to be done. Halloween is the best horror film. Ever. No related content found.",8,0,1,4 January 2012
The Queen," What a lovely Queen indeed
","From Academy Award nominated director Stephen Frears comes The Queen, the story of the untimely death of Princess Diana and the toll it placed on Queen Elizabeth of England and her royal subjects. Helen Mirren plays the beautiful monarch in the most spot on biopic performance of the 2006.Writer Peter Morgan, responsible for penciling The Last King of Scotland, makes this rather short film everything to gander and awe at. The dialogue is completely engaging never leaving the viewer outside the room rather, inviting us in to this tragic time of loss and accountability.Mirren as stated before, brings her best performance of her career. Within the subtlety of Queen Elizabeth lies the torment and frustration of a powerful woman thrust into a difficult situation. Besides bringing forth a strange and eerie resemblance of the woman, Mirren doesn't just imitate like other actors tend to do, she inhabits the woman, both inside and out. The subtlety is quite beautiful and quite intimidating and the viewer feels awkward while viewing Ms. Mirren on screen. Not since her overrated performance in Robert Altman's Gosford Park, has Helen Mirren been so good.Michael Sheen, who has been nearly invisible in Hollywood plays the Prime Minister Tony Blair. Sheen, also with his subtlety shows power and compassion in the most powerful of scenes. There is no screaming or yelling, just plain nuisance and anxiety. As he tries to save the Queen from herself, he embodies a man that is completely familiar to the audience and shines in his most tender moments. What Sheen brings is much charisma and a strong likability factor that lacks often in films, especially when it's a biopicture.You can easily tell that director Stephen Frears has a high admiration for the Queen of England. To make a film where nothing really happens, seem like everything just happened is a triumph. And that's what The Queen is, a triumph, that is exquisitely acted and powerfully written. Along with Alexandre Desplat's score that adds tension to each scene, this film is easily one of the best films of 2006.Grade: ***½/****",8,2,3,18 October 2007
Straight Outta Compton," F. Gary Gray's gift to the world and N.W.A.
","'It's the film of my generation.' I uttered that exact phrase to my wife following what was one of the most vibrant experiences in a theater in some time. An undeniable love letter to one of the most influential groups in rap music history, F. Gary Gray's 'Straight Outta Compton' is a vivacious and powerfully timely piece that stands as the single best film of the year thus far. I can't recall a more prolific biopic that institutes its own sensibilities about its subjects with such adoration and respect. Acknowledging the absence of certain events in the lives of Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, and Easy E, and simply approaching the film as a piece of fiction, the movie is damn near flawless.Telling the story of the group NWA, as they emerge from the mean streets of Compton in Los Angeles, California in the mid-1980s and revolutionizes Hip Hop culture with their music and tales about life in the hood.This is one of the best examples of a film where three leads are treated with equal focus and respect. Each performer, O'Shea Jackson, Jr. (portraying Ice Cube), Jason Mitchell (portraying Easy E), and Corey Hawkins (portraying Dr. Dre.) all deliver invigorating performances. Jackson, Jr., the real-life son of Ice Cube, lives inside the character, delivering lines of powerful meaning. Mitchell finds his stride early in the film, executing a charisma and charm that few actors can deliver in a film such as this. Oscar-worthy is too broad a term to describe his abilities in the film, it's downright sensational and something I'm sure to remember for some time. Hawkins grows into the role as each minute progresses, before launching himself into the psyche of Dr. Dre and dissolving into the man. Academy Award nominee Paul Giamatti follows the energy and arc of his character with determination and presents another strong performance for his résumé. Another strong standout is R. Marcos Taylor as Suge Knight, the closest thing to a conventional movie villain but an embodiment of greed and aggression.'Straight Outta Compton' is so much more than a biopic. It's a full- on musical epic, a character study that isn't shy about what it knows and what it decides to show its audience. The music is at the core, but the lives and message are what really drive the movie. Looking back at films like 'Selma,' a film that captured the time so perfectly and effortlessly, Gray's film manages to create its own defining staples in our nation's history. It's honest about the truth of the streets. As someone who grew up in both the Bronx and Jersey City, two urban cities with its own fair share of hardships (and in no way comparing either to Compton, CA), I appreciated everything that the film chose to show and say. The hunger for money and acceptance, or the ill-fitting look of a man from the ghetto who sits in a house that is larger than anything he could have ever dreamed. The script and story by Jonathan Herman, Andrea Berloff, S. Leigh Savidge, and Alan Wenkus is littered with fantastic narrative elements and raw projections of these men and who they were/are.Gray's film is not just an acting and storytelling showcase, it's also one of the technical marvels of the year. Cinematographer Matthew Libatique, Oscar-nominee for 'Black Swan,' gives a polished and engaging feel to every scene he shoots. His decisions about framing either an emotional moment or a light chuckle for the audience to indulge, is simple mesmerizing. Editors Billy Fox and Michael Tronick take 147 minutes of epic storytelling, and never let up for a second. I was involved in every scene, every frame, and every trait that Gray's film had to offer. Composer Joseph Trapenese (another Jersey City native!) takes his opportunities well to inject a swell of sentimentality and passion when the moment calls for it. You don't expect a composer to shine in a film about a music group yet he does tremendously. This is film is not for everyone. I'd be hard-pressed to recommend this film to many people unless I was sure about what films they typically like. It's vulgar yet genuine, and graphic yet sensitive. The music takes over your soul though. I've been playing N.W.A. music the entire time I've been writing this, letting the lyrics and beats take on a brand new meaning because of Gray's masterpiece. And that's exactly what the film is...a masterpiece. A film that needs to be considered by not just awards, but by all who love daring filmmaking.'Straight Outta Compton' is distributed by Universal Pictures and is currently in theaters.",9,13,47,19 August 2015
The Dark Knight Rises," Ladies and Gentlemen...We have an Oscar contender!
","'Ladies and gentlemen, we have a contender' Those were my exact thoughts and tweet following the screening of Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight Rises. A little over twelve hours have passed, allowing what was seen to officially settle in. The Dark Knight Rises, dare I say it, is better than it's predecessor. With all my qualms and things that I found wrong in The Dark Knight (2008), Nolan goes back, corrects, and elevates everything in the superhero genre, frame by frame. If there were ever doubts about Christopher Nolan and his ability as a filmmaker, he puts all things to rest and declares himself one of the most innovative and visionary directors working today. He analyzes and interprets Batman in a way, I've never known possible. Nolan wants to make more than a 'Batman' film or just another 'superhero' movie. He reinvented the genre and quite possibly creates the best superhero film of all-time.Cinematographer Wally Pfister, always impeccable and dynamic with his camera work, goes well beyond the call of duty. Showing a master class on cinematography every step of the way. Film Editor Lee Smith finally nails the art of pacing and makes this near three-hour venture smooth and attainable for a second watch. The sound team is in charge and back in the game again, making explosions and car chases blow out the eardrums of its audiences. Pure adrenaline pumps through your veins. Unless you've been living under a rock, you know the basic plot elements of the story. I've avoided spoilers throughout this process and I will offer the same luxury to any person reading this. I'll say this, Nolan's story structure, and where he takes Batman in this tale, is pretty extraordinary and absolutely natural. The script is not perfect and while there are some flaws like rushed character developments and unclear plot details, its splitting hairs. The film is still remarkable but in a spoiler-filled look later this week, we'll get into qualms with the script.Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne/Batman is still adequate and acceptable in his respective role (and yes kids, the voice is still a problem, definitely better, but still distracting). Bale shows Bruce Wayne broken, rising, and risen in perfect succession. There's no denying that Bale, probably for the rest of this century, will be associated proudly and respectfully with this role and what he gave the character.Michael Caine as Alfred, gives the most heartfelt and endearing performance of all of Nolan's trilogy. It's Caine's best work since The Cider House Rules (1999) and if anyone is looking for an actor to recognize, look no further. Grassroots campaign, do your work.Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle, is sexy, confident, and offers a great balance of humor. Hathaway's casting was called into question for months, but rest assure, she delivers. In terms of creating and penning a unique female character, which has been pointed out as Nolan's one flaw as a screenwriter, it's a valiant effort and much better than our terrible Rachel Dawes. Hathaway elevates the material otherwise.Joseph Gordon-Levitt as John Blake is talented as always, diving deep into a character's motivations and executing with absolute precision. Marion Cotillard as Miranda Tate is the perfect balance to Hathaway's sexy Selina, enabling a turn not seen of her before. Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox is still great decoration and a terrific addition to an outstanding cast.Gary Oldman as Jim Gordon still remains the unsung hero of this franchise. Oldman's talents and electric execution of the words are of the highest quality of actors working today. Oldman shows restraint when needed and turbulence when necessary.What everyone is waiting on is the performance of Tom Hardy as the diabolical Bane. A little bit of advice, please try your absolute hardest to divorce the Joker and Heath Ledger's performance from 'Rises.' What we all witnessed in 2008 was a performance of a lifetime that may not be matched for years to come. Hardy as Bane is simply sensational. It's one Hardy's best turns thus far and on the merits of the film alone, he's quite possibly best-in-show. When looking information on the character, all I kept hearing and reading was 'carnage.' Carnage doesn't begin to describe what Bane is. Nolan and Hardy transcend into a place, darker and more malicious than any film seen this year. It was the PERFECT villain for this finale.Oscar-talk you ask? OK, here it goes. If there has ever been a chance for superhero film like The Dark Knight Rises to be nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards, and have the QUALITY be present, this is the time. When thinking of successful and brilliant trilogies like The Lord of the Rings and Star Wars, who have all had their dances with Oscar before, Nolan's film needs this moment. We're almost guaranteed nominations in Sound Mixing, Sound Editing, Film Editing with very likely mentions in Cinematography and perhaps Makeup. It DESERVES, and this is said without seeing many of the films slated to come out for the rest of 2012, to be among a Best Picture and Director lineups. A nomination for Nolan has to be considered when putting this film against any other film this year or superhero film of ANY year. It's the finest directing work of this genre so far. Point blank. Period. Can't think of anyone else better.The Dark Knight Rises is not just the best film of the summer, it's possibly the best film of the year.",9,6,14,18 July 2012
Saving Mr. Banks," Emma Thompson radiates in John Lee Hancock's 'Saving Mr. Banks'
","Beautifully ambitious and eagerly constructed, the success of Walt Disney Studios' homage to its heritage is anchored magnificently by the crowning work of Emma Thompson's career. John Lee Hancock's Saving Mr. Banks is a tenderly affectionate tale featuring one of the year's finest ensembles. Following a classic three act structure, when the film begins, it undoubtedly lifts off and hooks you almost immediately. Held back by a few poor choices in the editing room, there's no denying the glamour, chemistry, and witchery that the film sets on you. Saving Mr. Banks is feverishly delightful.Written by Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith, the film tells the story of P.L. Travers, the author of 'Mary Poppins,' who in the early 1960's met with Walt Disney and his creative team to decide whether to sign the rights of her beloved book to the magic studio. During the production, Travers reflects on her childhood and her relationship with her loving father, played by Colin Farrell, intertwining the magic of her beloved novel and the guilt of a troubled past.As an unbridled, even at times downright vicious P.L. Travers, Thompson hasn't pursued and thrived in a character of such complexities since James Ivory directed her to an Oscar in Howard's End over twenty years ago. Travers' mannerisms and moral guidelines are captured charmingly by the creative team. Thompson and director Hancock clearly worked closely together to nail the nuance of the central character's focus. She buries herself in the time, and that of designer Daniel Orlandi's stunning costume work, to be the perfect entity of a fruitful tale. Playing the young Travers, Annie Rose Buckley is cute as a button and has some real juicy moments to sink her teeth into. Unfortunately, some directorial choices hinder any substantial connection between her and the audience to muster any real attention.Marcel and Smith's script is pure gold. There is such a dynamic and balance of charming and witty comedy tied in with heart wrenching and polarizing drama. Their assembling of the movie era, capturing subtle inequities of the business, and painting a magical story, will likely stand as one of the screenplays of the year. There is a heavy yet almost invisible component of layered despondency that the two writers choose to include that make the film truly sing.Upon hearing the casting of Tom Hanks as the iconic Walt Disney, I have to admit my reservations were at an all-time high. Hanks, who has excelled in his career playing the everyday man, and floored the bulk of America with his performance in Captain Phillips this year, absolutely nails his role as the film executive tycoon. His choices of character beats, that don't put down the material nor distract the audience from the story being told, is spot on nearly every moment. He maneuvers his way with his charisma but allows the animosity to fester in the viewer. I was thoroughly impressed.Where the film missteps greatly is in the direction and options that John Lee Hancock chooses to execute throughout. 'Banks' essentially tells two stories. One of the present time during the production of 'Mary Poppins' and the other of P.L. Travers' childhood. Hancock chooses to tell these two stories simultaneously, awkwardly transitioning from one time period to the other, and ripping us away from the story we're desperately invested in. In many ways, his direction will be seen in the same reactionary split of Tom Hooper's Les Miserables. There will be some, likely many, that will have no problem with his bumbling alterations in certain scenes and there will be some, like myself, that sees that he's still has a long way to go. Not gunning him down as a complete disaster, he has about three instances where the potential and vision are clearly realized. Hancock knows how to tug at the heartstrings. When a scene works, he accomplishes it with the utmost confidence and brilliant demeanor. A tightly paced and pivotal scene involving the song 'A British Bank' showcases Hancock's best varieties, and also that of co-star Colin Farrell.For my dollar, everything connects and rises during the creation of 'Let's Go and Fly a Kite.' The cast comes together and unifies in such a harmonious fashion and Hancock chooses to utilize all the supporting players including that of the wonderful Bradley Whitford, the witty BJ Novak, and in his best turn yet, Jason Schwartzman. Hancock operates these three men in an ingenious method. Paul Giamatti is a compassionate force, especially in his exchanges with Thompson while Ruth Wilson makes me absolutely adore the ground in which she walks.Besides the dynamite work of Thompson, I lived for the miraculous music of Academy Award nominated composer Thomas Newman. Brilliantly hinting at some of his other composed works, everything about the music in Saving Mr. Banks purely resonates because of Newman's continued abilities to insert his own personality into his work. You can't find another film musician this aware of his talents and continued drive to elevate his own material. It's the Oscar slam dunk we've been waiting for in Original Score.http://www.awardscircuit.com",7,26,42,7 November 2013
Son of Saul," The Gifts of László Nemes and Géza Röhrig
","We simply don't deserve László Nemes, the first-time writer/director of Hungary's submission for the Oscar's Foreign Language category, 'Son of Saul.' Nemes vacuums everything we think we know about filmmaking and the Holocaust, and gives it a raw, intense, and fresh outlook that we haven't seen since Roman Polanski's 'The Pianist,' perhaps even Steven Spielberg's 'Schindler's List.' Not to mention, he is thoroughly aided and indebted to the stunning and remarkable talent of Géza Röhrig, in his feature debut. The two simply dance circles around other films and performances seen in this year, with an authentic and genuine approach to art, that we just don't get to experience too often. I'm in awe.'Son of Saul' tells the story of Saul Ausländer, a Hungarian member of the Sonderkommando, the group of Jewish prisoners isolated from the camp and forced to assist the Nazis in the machinery of large- scale extermination. In October 1944, Saul discovers the corpse of a boy he takes for his son. As the Sonderkomando plans a rebellion, Saul decides to carry out an impossible task.Its direction like Nemes that should make the world very optimistic about the future of cinema. If we have filmmakers like him, getting in the trenches of history and the human spirit, and beckoning its awakening into our souls, we should be so lucky to have him display the beauty and evil of the world in such a provocative and engaging manner. His choices in which to shoot the film, and portray one of the most heinous acts in the history of our existence is just downright scintillating. 'Son of Saul' plays as if we're watching a disturbing, noxious, and depraved home movie about a time in which we never want to see. From a near first-person perspective, we enter the revolting world of Auschwitz-Birkenau. He uses out of focus camera work, to not bath in the bloodshed, but wallow in the psyche of a man, that is desperate for purpose. It's the single best direction of the year. I'd go so far to say this could be the single best direction seen this decade. His script, along with co- writer Clara Royer, is so painstakingly simple but echoes decades of oppression in its short, respectful run time.Don't call him a 'poet by profession' because newcomer Géza Röhrig doesn't believe in the word profession. There's only artists. Géza Röhrig is an artist, of which I haven't seen in some time. With little words, he says countless and devastating things about what he's feeling and what we know about ourselves. He doesn't use cheap tricks to engage the audiences like 'really intense face' or 'really scared moving.' Röhrig displays the numb, almost disengaged weight of the world in every physical and vocal movement he chooses to exhibit. It's a flawless, masterful performance that we need more of in this cinematic world.Cinematographer Mátyás Erdély is your next great craftsman to watch, even though making his mark on films like 'The Quiet Ones' and 'Miss Bala.' He frames close-ups that Danny Cohen himself, would hope to achieve in his next collaboration with Tom Hooper. He stays with a person, a scene, a moment, so intelligently, and so vibrantly, he places each one of us in the rooms, full of fear, and full of hopelessness. The subtle yet effective music by László Melis is sonorous but the Sound team is what really needs their praise. Tamás Dévényi (Production Soundmixer), Tamás Székely (Sound Editor), and Tamás Zányi (Sound Designer) create monstrous and dynamic effects that essentially become its own focal point of the story. We are listening intently, desperately, and just fearful at every nick, boom, and cry we come in contact with. It's something everyone should and will notice and applaud.'Son of Saul' sneaks up on you. It's too important and critical to our cinematic landscape to overlooked or forgotten. I can't imagine a more dour and sullen experience this year that fills my heart with this much adoration. It stands toe-to-toe with most Holocaust films created in and before my lifetime. It may be the definitive one this millennium.",10,135,187,5 October 2015
Flight," Flight brings Denzel back to greatness!
","Robert Zemeckis' latest film Flight starring Academy Award Winner Denzel Washington is not only thoroughly entertaining and terrifically structured, it encompasses a soul that Hollywood hasn't really delivered in quite some time. The film, that closed the New York Film Festival, is simply one of the best films of the year.Flight tells the story of Whip Whitaker, an airline pilot that saves a plane and nearly all its passengers from a certain death. When an investigation is carried out to look into the details of the crash, Whip's troubling lifestyle begins to surface. Writer John Latins creates a dynamic and an internal narrative confrontation for viewers to become immersed in a story full of mental struggle. It's a unique and very engaging story that stands as one of season's best efforts.Denzel Washington, and not to be taken lightly, is fully in the zone and portrays one of his finest screen moments in years. I haven't been this impressed with his abilities as an actor since The Hurricane (1999). He lands solidly in Whip, giving us his natural aggression, charisma, and flaws. Allowing us to travel with Whip on this journey, Mr. Washington proves once and for all, he is one of the great treasures of American cinema. Denzel gives an access root into the character for all intended purposes, a clear understanding of the inner resistance that will not only plague Whip, but the movie audience as well.The story doesn't seem like an obvious choice for Robert Zemeckis, who has excelled in genres that have provided masterpieces like Forrest Gump (1994) and Cast Away (2000). As the film provides a more dark and jagged approach in his directorial style, Zemeckis executes with precision. It's a satisfactory effort from the director who makes his return to live action after a long string of motion-capture efforts. Assisting Washington's bravura performance is Oscar-nominee Don Cheadle, who teamed up with Denzel in the 90's classic film, Devil in a Blue Dress (1995). As the wise-cracking lawyer, whose own moral values may be tested in exchange for corporate and criminal immunity, Cheadle is a relieved presence. In a comedic and near-brilliant performance, John Goodman steals Flight from every actor including Washington in his short, two-scene appearances. Goodman continues to show an effortless range, even in poor film choices, and a confidence that makes him one of the great character actors working today. It's a performance that Oscar should consider on multiple levels. In a heartbreaking turn, Kelly Reilly as the drug-addicted Nicole, provides an emotional epicenter and boundary that stands as one of Latins' great writing achievements. Reilly is simply marvelous.Continuing to beef up their acting resume, the great Bruce Greenwood shines while Brian Geraghty continues to prove he is one of Hollywood's best kept secrets.Composer Alan Silvestri orchestrates an outstanding score that is both melodic and soothing. Cinematographer Don Burgess, once-nominated for Forrest Gump, gives clean, fresh camera lenses look into a shockingly dirty and gritty story. Zemeckis' handle of the astounding opening scenes, especially the plane crash, is one of the best visual and nail- biting moments of the year. Its Zemeckis at his best!Flight is not only one of the best cinematic efforts of the New York Film Festival; it stands as a great surprise and entry into the 2012 Oscar season. Denzel Washington is completely Oscar-bound but the buck shouldn't stop there; a deserved consideration campaign should be given to John Goodman and Kelly Reilly along with screenwriter John Latins. Flight is a home-run!Read More Reviews at The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com)",8,152,215,16 October 2012
Unbroken," Angelina Jolie's inspiring epic features star-making turns by Jack O'Connell and Miyavi...
","Read more @ Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com)There are so many things to admire when looking upon Angelina Jolie's English language directorial debut. 'Unbroken' checks most of the boxes of a great film. Inspiring, moving, and emotionally resonate, Jolie's epic lands on the back end of the film year and becomes an instant contender. Pulling out the big guns with legendary cinematographer Roger Deakins, and a Sound team that includes five-time Oscar nominee Frank A. Montaño ('Gladiator'), Emmy-nominee Jon Taylor ('Apollo 11″), Production Sound Mixer David Lee, BAFTA winner Becky Sullivan ('The Fugitive'), and MPSE Winner Andrew DeCristofaro ('To the Arctic 3D'), both technical aspects of the film are among the very best seen, and heard in 2014. 'Unbroken' is an uplifting, daunting experience, telling the story of a man who fought against impossible odds to survive. A worldly film that speaks to so much happening today.The screenplay, which went through three drafts by William Nicholson, Richard LaGravenese, and Joel Coen & Ethan Coen, is the film's biggest hiccup. The first half of the film is entrenched, marvelous even, focusing on the survival and story of Louis Zamperini. The Olympic story, as you'd expect, is secondary to our tale. Playing in flashbacks from Zamperini on a flight mission, then to his early days as a child, rambunctious and being inspired by his older brother to join the track team. Jolie focuses on the world around Zamperini in those early scenes. Introducing an Italian-immigrant mother, praying for her son's safety and guidance, along with a disciplinarian father. You have moments in those early scenes that call back to 'Forrest Gump,' (still unsure if that's a compliment or not) but the visual aesthetics are well positioned by DP Roger Deakins. Gorgeous to look at 100% of the time.The performances are fully developed. Jack O'Connell, as Louis Zamperini, provides another example of a killer breakout year with other performances in 'Starred Up' and ''71.' His dedication to the role is undeniable, losing weight, and managing to elevate some of the more stagnant scenes. He's an exciting actor to watch. Domhnall Gleeson's turn as Phil, Louis' 'boat-companion,' is truly remarkable. I do wish we got a split story of Louis and Phil's journey. There's a beautiful dynamic that the two have, and that could have been explored. I think it's just a missed opportunity.The second half of the film is dominated by the aura and presence of Miyavi (or if you prefer Takamasa Ishiara) as the diabolical Mutsushiro Watanabe, commanding officer of the concentration camp where Louis is imprisoned. Just one year after Michael Fassbender scored an Oscar nomination for '12 Years a Slave,' a role that is similar in structure and similar by aura, Miyavi creates a multi- layered man, with so many things going on inside, aching for an explanation for the audience. Not everything will be answered, but he feels the most satisfying of every character on screen. A Supporting Actor contender has emerged in Miyavi. A breakout performance.Angelina Jolie has a firm hand on what is happening on-screen. Rumors have made their rounds that there is a director's cut, likely about 30 minutes longer. I have to imagine that if true, that is the version that feels more complete. The last quarter is problematic, rushed even, and I imagine that's where many of the cuts were made. Jolie's abilities as a filmmaker are way above par for a person on their second feature film. If we look at many director's second outings, I don't think you'd find to many as polished or confident as Jolie is behind the camera. She doesn't shy away from the brutality of the story. 'Unbroken' is the most fitting title of any story delivered this year. Encompassing everything that this film is about.Oscar race questions? Thought you'd never ask. Easy pick for a Best Picture nomination with all the crafts its likely to eat up including Cinematography, Film Editing, Sound Mixing, Sound Editing, and a beautiful score by Alexandre Desplat. In a thin Adapted Screenplay race, the four-man writing team should find wiggle room, and in a just world, Miyavi should join the Supporting Actor contenders and score his first Academy Award nomination. Angelina Jolie will gain lots of respect for what she has constructed. If anything, this begins the narrative and excitement for her next feature 'By the Sea' with hubby Brad Pitt.'Unbroken' is a fascinating deconstruction of a man beaten to his core. An enlightening story, featuring star-making performances, and an abundance of masterclass filmmaking techniques. The Oscar race continues.",7,21,52,2 December 2014
Munich," Dark as Spielberg has ever been
","From two-time Academy Award winning director Steven Spielberg comes Munich, the story of the assassination of the 11 Israeli athletes who were killed at the 1972 Olympic Games. The film stars Eric Bana as Avner, head of the intelligence unit assigned to kill everyone involved in the assassination. This is Bana's finest performance and finally taps into that thespian persona that we've all known he was capable of. Bana hasn't been more aware of his surroundings and character depth that his Avner requires like we've ever seen him.The supporting players are adequate enough to make it through the picture but some are developed better than others. Geoffrey Rush as Ephraim, the operative heading Avner in different directions doesn't wear his character as well as others we've seen in past performances. Mathieu Kassovitz as one of the team members is the best of the supporting players as a torn individual between the job he is given and the results of his actions in the eyes of the almighty.Ciaran Hinds has a presence on screen that gives the extra topping of an actor's showcase of talent. Daniel Craig as the 'badass' operative is equally as charging and impressionable.The candle of this picture is Steven Spielberg who's never been this dark and this thorough since his achievement Schlinder's List. Not holding any measure to Schlinder's List or Saving Private Ryan which are cinematic gems with this auteur at his finest, Munich is immensely erotic in cinematography and editing and a score by John Williams to die for. His choices here rather risky are so unlike anything we've seen of him before.This is an exquisite motion picture and should be seen by all. Eric Roth's screenplay is pin-point with dialogue and rich in flow. This is definitely the Spielberg show.Grade: ***/****",8,3,4,18 December 2007
Godzilla," Godzilla FINALLY Enters the 21st Century With Style
","When there's smoke, there's fire and the screen is ablaze in Gareth Edward's reboot Godzilla. From a technical and aesthetic level, the film is unmatched by anything seen in 2014 thus far. Exhibiting such creative styles of directing, Edwards hones in on all of Godzilla's personality traits that have made him such an icon to the cinematic universe. Everything from his choices of screen shots, brilliantly set up by Oscar-nominated Cinematographer Seamus McGarvey, and his approval of Alexandre Desplat's haunting score, Edwards successfully brings Godzilla in to the new century with admiration and respect. This is one of the most entertaining summer blockbusters of its kind since Jurassic Park.There's nothing that can benefit any person seeking to see the film if I reveal any plot points. I did an admirable job of steering clear of any plot spoilers that could have ruined the experience. I implore all movie goers to exercise the same discipline for any future franchises or films they are anxiously awaiting. What I will speak about is the at times, uneven script by Max Borenstein and Dave Callaham. Borenstein's most notable credit is Swordswallowers and Thin Men (2003) and Callaham has had a hand in The Expendables franchise and Doom. The first third of the film is succinctly riveting, and full of rich and layered characters that lay an incredible foundation for the story. After a key character is disposed of forty minutes in, the story takes clichéd approaches to action heroes that both feel unnatural and unrealistic. Understanding that this is science fiction, I need a strong level of believability for a film to succeed. There are several instances that eye-rolling occurred and annoyance set in.From an acting stand point, there are many great things that are being displayed. Bryan Cranston is a true highlight, full of ferocity and emotion that settles the viewer as much as he creates nervous tension. I'll fully admit to gushing over the reality that now, Academy Award nominated actress Sally Hawkins, is now in a summer blockbuster franchise and slowly becoming a mainstream entity. As the lead, Aaron Taylor-Johnson executes when appropriate and challenges his own abilities as we've come to miss in films like Savages and Kick-Ass. In this franchise, Taylor-Johnson illuminates as a more confident, detailed version of 'Jake Sully' (Sam Worthington) from Avatar. Another true highlight is Elizabeth Olsen, who continues to be one of my favorite actresses working without THE role yet. Though she's minimized to cheap crying and terrified screams, Olsen stands out.The rest of the all-star cast: David Strathairn, Ken Watanabe, Juliette Binoche, and Victor Rasuk are all solid performers in otherwise, underwritten and/or misfired roles.Production Designer Owen Paterson builds an apocalyptic world to an outstanding degree, especially in one that takes place in present day. He's excelled in things like this before with past efforts in The Matrix and V for Vendetta. The Visual Effects team is simply astonishing. Godzilla looks superb. Every detail, nuance, and mannerism is marvelously captured. It's the strongest visual medium that the year has offered. If there's one thing that you can take to the Oscar bank, it's the Visual Effects team. I am also completely enamored by the Sound Mixing and Sound Editing that was audibly enticing to the ears.Godzilla is pure fun and pure entertainment, no matter how you slice it. If you're looking for something to offer up some great laughs, visuals, and thrills, you have it all right here. There's more depth to the film, something that many will find and latch onto however, it's not a complete home run like one would have hoped. It's still vastly superior to the garbage that was the 1998 film. This Godzilla is just fine. By the way, if you can, IMAX 3D is just what the doctor ordered on this film. Do yourself a favor, and fill the prescription.",6,1,8,15 May 2014
300," A 300 for Effects, a 3 for Story
","This visual spectacle based on the graphic novel by Frank Miller is diverting as it beautiful. The film tells the story of King Leonidas and the 300 other Spartans who fought in the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 B.C. against over a million blood thirsty warriors. Gerard Butler best known for his lead portrayal in The Phantom of the Opera and his villainous turn in Dracula 2000 plays the headstrong king. Butler who has become a steady pretty face in Hollywood takes the action hero role to a new level.With memorable one liners, Butler reinvents the cliché hero like Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jean Claude Van Damme have in the past.. With poor dramatic moments, the role doesn't demand a well equipped character actor but abs, muscles, and strong facial features. The acting revelation if you could even call it, comes from 'King Leonidas'' supportive wife, 'Queen Lorgo' played exquisitely by the breakout star of the year, Lena Headey. She sizzles the screen with more than her looks but with striking pain-stricken ability to scene steal as if it were a crime. Her Queen is one of the stronger supportive wife turns to hit the screen in our new century.Dominic West who is one of the stronger supporting actors working today plays cowardly villain role reminiscent of Joaquin Phoenix's 'Commodus' in Gladiator. As brief as the role is, it leaves sour taste and gut wrenching imprints on the viewer post-film. The rest of the cast do what their roles demand but nothing out of the ordinary.Visual effects, sound, and powerful cinematography are the brighter parts of the film. You can't help but admire the fascinating choice to shoot this film as a Michelangelo portrait with beautiful scenery and outstanding results. Engaging as the film is don't look for character depth or emotional connections as this is a watch and go picture. Be entertained as you can.Grade: **½/****",6,1,3,6 October 2007
Inside Llewyn Davis," Oscar Isaac is Incredible! Coens Best Since 'Fargo'
","I am completely smitten. I have long admired Joel Coen and Ethan Coen  and what they have offered the realm of cinema. I am in love with  'Fargo' still until this day, and they've provided solid efforts on  nearly every outing since. Their newest endeavor that focuses on the  folk scene in 1961 is an absolute dream. Everything from the impeccable  Oscar Isaac to the music that enriches the deepest trenches of the  soul, 'Inside Llewyn Davis' is one of the best pictures of the year,  plain and simple. It's the Coen Brothers finest film since 'Fargo.'  Our story begins with a folk singer, Llewyn Davis that has continued to  pursue a music career in 1961 despite being penniless and lacking any  real stability. Migrating from couch to couch, we get a deep look into  a character with a dream that just won't die. As he fights for his  chance to share his voice with the world, following an unexpected loss  of his singing partner, Llewyn is hard to love. He makes poor choices  and seems to lack any responsibility in his life. It's a wonderful  creation of a character that offers insight into a changing time in our  history.  First of all, I can't get the amazing music out of my head. All the  songs used are absolutely brilliant. Oscar Isaac's richly matured tone  is so soothing and authentic; I'm surprised a music company hasn't  nabbed him up to make a record yet. His opening and closing songs are  his, as well as the film's, pivotal moments that encapsulate the  endearing message and theme. 'Hang Me, Oh Hang Me' and 'Fare Thee Well  (Dink's Song)' are astonishing records that may not just fall into an  Oscar race but a Grammy wouldn't shock me in the least. It has the same  magical effect as 'Searching for Sugar Man,' two films that seemed to  capture the innocence and culture of a generation that seems lost. In  terms of performance, Isaac is incredible. So raw and genuine, it's one  of the year's finest performances by any actor. He has made himself one  of the most exciting actors to watch in the coming years. This will  lead him into more challenging and accessible roles. This guy could  become one of our finest actors in just five years' time. This is  something that should land him an Oscar nomination for Best Actor. It's  very much deserved.  In their respective but short screen times, John Goodman, Garrett  Hedlund, and Carey Mulligan are all infectious and notable. Goodman  plays a character similar to his 'Harling Mays' from Robert Zemeckis'  'Flight' and makes the most out of his appearance. Mulligan is volatile  and I loved every second of her. She brings lots of dark humor and fire  to a role that shows the depth of her abilities as an actress who can  perform impeccably in any genre. We even get her singing again which  had me melt two years ago during her 'New York, New York' in Steve  McQueen's 'Shame.' Hedlund comes and goes but makes his mark as he  often does.  Justin Timberlake has made a seamless transition from musician to actor  and back to musician. Great in roles like 'The Social Network' where  his star power doesn't distract from the story at hand, in a Coen  Brothers film, where he sings (in a very current pop way), he becomes a  bit distracting. I was very aware that Timberlake, probably this  generation's Michael Jackson, was sharing the screen. More than likely  not his fault, it could be a case of being 'too big' for your movie.  One thing that the film has taught mewe need to give Adam Driver more  movie roles. Timberlake, Isaac, and Driver put their marks on one of  the songs 'Please Mr. Kennedy,' and make it one of the year's most fun  and remarkable numbers.  Joel and Ethan Coen continue to show their ranges in directing and  writing. Flawlessly executed in character understanding and keeping our  story moving. Llewyn Davis is such a complex and interesting man and  their screenplay gives Isaac room to breathe and explore the subtle  nuances that make his character unique and real. As their alter ego  Roderick Jaynes, the film moves like a smooth monorail, hitting all its  marks and picking up new and exciting quirks along the way.  An almost silver-green canvas evokes the dark and grey tones of the New  York scene in 1961. Cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel masterfully  captures the ticks and beats of Isaac as he sings with heartbreaking  emotion and walks through the frigid cold streets. Jess Gonchor's  production design places us all in the folk scene, with intimate bar  settings, old-time music studios, and even the classic feel of a  Greenwich Village apartment building.  CBS Films has a gem on their hands with 'Inside Llewyn Davis.' A sure-  fire Oscar contender in several categories including Best Picture. If  there's any justice in the film world, Oscar Isaac would firmly sit  near the top of the finest performances of 2013 in Best Actor and nab  nearly every award he comes in contact with. 'Inside Llewyn Davis' is  sensational and an instant classic to be remembered.",10,102,197,26 September 2013
Her," Just about the best thing you can see in 2013...
","Talk about closing with a bang. Spike Jonze's long-awaited original film about a writer that falls in love with his operating system is not only the best film to play at this year's New York Film Festival; it very well could be the very best film of the year. 'Her' is the finest writing and directorial endeavor of Spike Jonze's career. And then there's the towering and crowning work of Academy Award nominee Joaquin Phoenix who proves once again, he's the finest actor working today, hands down. You can't find a more dynamic and compelling story about the human connection and where we're headed as a society.When 'Her' opens up, it snaps you immediately into the story. Phoenix plays Theodore, a writer for a website that makes letters for just about anyone. As he tries to find life during the midst of his divorce from his wife Catherine (played by a beautiful Rooney Mara), Theodore finds solace in a friendship with a new OS (operating system) named Samantha (voiced by Scarlett Johansson). The two develop a relationship in a world where OS's are becoming the norm with society.Jonze's has never been the conventional director as we've seen in his other brilliant efforts 'Being John Malkovich' and 'Where the Wild Things Are.' Jonze sets out to tell a story and deliver all the intricate details for us to understand each character. His focus on Theodore, giving him a real sense of loneliness without falling into cliché character ticks and beats that we've seen countless times in other romantic films, Jonze constructs a real man living in a world where technology has taken precedent over human connection.Christopher Nolan should take notes from Jonze on the assembling of female counterparts in a story. Catherine and Theodore's friend Amy, played by the always dependable Amy Adams, both feel genuinely authentic. Mara, who's already delivered one other powerful performance in 'Ain't Them Bodies Saints' earlier this year, is finely utilized. She shows once again that she's a true professional, with limited screen time (many in flashbacks); she can staple herself in your memory.Amy Adams is always the sprinkle on top in all of her films. As 'Amy,' the awkward friend and neighbor who sympathizes more with Theodore more than she'd like to, Adams expertly executes. With four prior Oscar nominations to her credit, her stunning portrayal is just another fantastic pin to add to her credits. She could find traction during the awards season if the film hits in the right way. That's also part to the petty Oscar rules about rewarding voice performances because if that wasn't the case, Scarlett Johansson would be on stage holding an Oscar of her own next March. As 'Samantha,' Johansson has never tapped into the essence of her abilities as an actress the way she does in 'Her.' As an OS, full of wonder and curiosity, 'Samantha' is essentially a child. Learning at a rapid rate and studying the behaviors of the human mind, she looks at the world through the eyes of Theodore. Johansson holds our hand in through the tale, even when her voice isn't on screen. This is the type of work that could convince the Board of Governors to rethink the eligibility of an acting performance. This is a masterful work that I'll remember for years to come.And then there's Joaquin Phoenix...oh, Mr. Phoenix. Fresh off his historic performance in Paul Thomas Anderson's 'The Master' just a year ago, I didn't think he could impress me so soon and yet here we are. His sensitive and perceptive take on the role is what films are all about. It's one of the best things that 2013 has offered and a performance that could land him his first Oscar. I think Phoenix himself was impressed with the work he and his colleagues have accomplished. At the press conference, he actually gave an answer to one of the questions from the audience. If anyone was in attendance at the conference for James Gray's 'The Immigrant' - a prickly, disengaged Phoenix put on his sunglasses and put the microphone on the floor. This is a performance that you can identify with. He's not simply awkward for the sake of being, he has baggage and connection issues. There's sincerity in his words and mannerisms. A getaway in a cabin, alone but with 'Samantha' encapsulates everything about Theodore. Phoenix achieves the impossible and is an instant Oscar contender.But 'Her' isn't just about the writing and performances; it's an all- around technical marvel. Most notably the Production Design of K.K. Barrett, who has worked on 'Where the Wild Things Are.' Our story takes place in a futuristic (though never said how far ahead) Los Angeles and with shooting overseas, Barrett captures the clout of the city and its inside counterparts. Cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema's use of colors and smooth palettes are things of a dream. Affectionately snuggling up to Phoenix as he whispers the sweetness of words to 'Samantha' or the sweetness of a new letter at work, Hoytema has quickly become one of my favorite DP's, especially following 'Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy' and 'Let the Right One In.' Arcade Fire and Karen O. are simply magic in their music that accompanies our story about love. A modern yet classical composition that in key scenes could move you to tears.'Her' is one of the best love stories I've witnessed in some time. Charlie Kaufman will always have the honor of penning my favorite love story of all-time 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' but Spike Jonze and 'Her' are giving it a true run for the money at the moment. Warner Bros. must know what they have with a limited release in late November; this...Read More @ http://www.awardscircuit.com",10,383,594,12 October 2013
Slumdog Millionaire," One of the best pictures in ages...
","Truly deserving of all the praise its receiving, Slumdog Millionaire is the best film in years. Director Danny Boyle completely outdid himself with this touching tale Jamal Malik, a 'slumdog' who makes it to the final question of the Indian version of 'Who Wants to be a Millionaire?' When he is suspected of cheating, he explains his extraordinary tale of how he knows each answer.Dev Patel in a terrific breakthrough role, gives a daring and emotional performance as Jamal. Freida Pinto stars as his love Latika, and as beautiful as she is, the role doesn't demand too much of her.Cinematography is the chief technical point of the film with crisp editing, a score to die for, and an amazing story that you couldn't believe it true unless you witnessed. This might be, (in my humble opinion) the best love story of the last 25 years and definitely the best picture of the year.****/****",10,0,3,15 December 2008
Mad Max: Fury Road," George Miller's reboot is full of action, technical marvels, and a badass performance in Charlize Theron...
","Read more @ The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com)The slickest, coolest ride you can take this year has arrived in the form of George Miller's 'Mad Max: Fury Road' starring the talented Tom Hardy and the impeccably magnificent Charlize Theron. A reboot that blows every aspect of the original away with stunning cinematography by John Seale, luscious production design by Colin Gibson, and the most vivacious score of the year so far by Junkie XL. 'Mad Max' kicks ass and takes names.As action-packed and lively as 'Mad Max' is in its gargantuan shell of fire and music, there are some shortcomings that Miller's film exhibits. From a narrative standpoint, it presents some of the most surprising and endearing female characters seen in some time. Everything about the women, particularly Oscar-winner Theron, is excitingly refreshing. You come to think that the title of the film should have been called 'Furiosa' rather than 'Mad Max.' 'Max' feels completely secondary to everything that's going on around him. He doesn't envelope the same presence that Mel Gibson's character did in the original, and that's both a positive and a negative. Is it intentional or is the far superior and interesting work of its female heroins just easier for an audience member to latch onto. The script by Miller, Brendan McCarthy, and Nick Lathouris is rapidly inconsistent in the film's first 30 minutes. With no clear directives or plot devices, it almost comes off as a road trip movie with no set destination, at least in the first quarter. Once the speed picks up, boy does it just thrust you from your seat. There are also some abrupt and sharp turns from explosions to emotions that don't exactly feel natural. There was a time or two that I rolled my eyes at certain attempts of emotional reaction.Academy Award winner John Seale, who has continued to explore his narrative lenses in his career, takes on a new world of artistic capture. He makes the viewer a passenger and an active member of the action at hand. The sound team rises to the occasion in this post-apocalyptic world of gears, guns, and fire. The greatest achievement of the film's psychedelic roller coaster is the potent and passionate music of Junkie XL, whose previous scores on films like '300: Rise of an Empire' and 'Divergent' could have never hinted at the masterpiece composition he would create for George Miller. The score echoes past works from Bernard Herrmann ('Psycho' in particular) and Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. It'll be a travesty if at bare minimum, the film isn't recognized for Best Original Score at next year's Oscars.There have been rumors that this is Charlize Theron's version of Ripley in 'Aliens.' While the comparison is somewhat apt, I find it more in line with someone like Linda Hamilton in 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day.' 'Furiosa' is Sarah Connor reincarnated into a one- handed death machine, and she's freaking awesome. It's the badass performance of the year, perhaps the last few years from an action star. A performance that hasn't highlighted her abilities as an actress this well since maybe 'Monster.' As the villainous 'Immortan Joe,' Hugh Keays-Byrne dominates with stature and aura that's palpable in nearly every scene he inhabits. He isn't afforded many opportunities to stretch out the boundaries of his Bane-like mask and become intimate with the viewer. Nicholas Hoult maintains a fun, comedic vine that slowly wraps around you as his story progresses. Finally, Tom Hardy is as cool as ever. This guy makes it look so easy to just be a part of something and blend into a canvas such as this. As mentioned before, he's surprisingly secondary to the story but what he does get a chance to offer is vividly real.Seeing the film in 3D didn't offer anything more than a few dizzy spells from some shaky camera syndrome. It's another example of 3D being utilized more as a gimmick, and not an additional asset. Admittedly, I'm not the hugest fan of 3D films with the exception of few I've encountered. I say save the 3 extra dollars and see it on regular full-size screen experience. It will more than suffice.From a summer blockbuster standpoint, you have to move 'Avengers: Age of Ultron' and 'Furious 7' aside to make way for something that stands on more of solid foundation of action storytelling. 'Mad Max: Fury Road' is an audacious and visually striking endeavor that is sure to stand out all year in some capacity. A technical marvel. I'd be excited to see where they'll bring the story from here. A franchise that has been successfully rebooted. Good job Hollywood.",8,10,57,12 May 2015
The Pursuit of Happyness," The Pursuit YES, the Happiness NOT
","Will Smith puts forth his best performance since his gut-wrenching portrayal of 'Muhammad Ali' in Ali and his son, Jaden Smith gives one of best child performances in the past decade but all those things don't mean this is a great picture. The film tells the story of Chris Gardener, a single dad who has had a few too many bills pile up and decides on a career change. He becomes an unpaid intern at a prestigious stock firm and his only source of income is selling microscope machines to doctors and hospitals. During this time he has tax problems, home issues, family separations, and many other things that could plow down the spirit of any human being. The story is entirely predictable and it's just the performances that pull you through.I feel the movie flaws in the fault of the writer, Steve Conrad who has written past misfires The Weather Man and Wrestling Ernest Hemingway. The film is 'inspired by a true story' and he made it into this unbelievable, downfall after downfall film that features Will Smith running entirely way too often and luck getting worse for no apparent reason. Logically, life does throw you curveballs and coincidences do happen, but come on, the audience isn't stupid. We need a bit more substance than that.Been homeless? Parents struggle immensely raising you? Feel like you're doing good in life and then something comes and knocks you down? If you answered yes, to any of those questions, then you should be touched by this picture. The sequences of Will Smith becoming homeless and watching his spirit collapse with his son sleeping in his arms in a bathroom stall is really heartbreaking. Due to Smith's powerful performance you feel the fear and anxiety right beside him and that daunting wondering of what to do next.The true revelation of the picture comes from Smith's young son Jaden Smith. May be more of the 'cute kid' factor but I walked out of the theater thinking of him the most. His 'knock knock' jokes, crying over his Captain America and general enlightenment of his father are the most poignant piece of the film. When the experience of the movie is over you want to know very badly where his son is and what he is doing. Jaden Smith created that for us; that love for little Christopher and wanting to teach him life lessons and make sure he doesn't get plowed by the negativity around him.Italian Director Gabriele Muccino played the film extremely safe with shot to shot dialogue and leaving no room for artistic imagery. But it is a solid effort and I wouldn't hesitate to see his next American film. All in all, The Pursuit of Happiness is a movie that a family could enjoy together and it will make you grateful for what you have but take it all with a grain of salt. This film stretches the mind and not in a good way.Grade: **1/2/****",6,0,3,30 December 2006
Cinderella Man," A Cinderella Story without the Glass Shoes
","From acclaimed director Ron Howard comes the mesmerizing and tantalizing Cinderella Man starring Oscar winners Russell Crowe and Renee Zellweger. Crowe plays James J. Braddock, a boxer in the 1920s who lost nearly everything he had in the great stock market crash. After his finances diminish, the boxer hits a losing streak and when all hope is lost, a sudden surge of luck comes to the noble James.When it comes to Crowe, he turns in one amazing performance after another. With previous nominated and awarded works in The Insider, Gladiator and A Beautiful Mind, Crowe still doesn't fail to impress the viewer. The vulnerability that Crowe lacks often in his tough guy roles is more evident than ever. It's his demeanor, dedication and well written character by Cliff Collingsworth and Akiva Goldsman that makes the film work so well.Zellweger, who plays Mae Braddock, the supportive wife of James gives a quite dull and mediocre performance. Zellweger who has been a top talent for the past ten years is suffering from over-exposure and not being able to bring new things to her roles she chooses. Bridget Jones' Diary, Chicago, Cold Mountain, we've seen it all yet she still lands these well written roles which could be home run hit for many other talented actresses.The entire cast of the film is quite superb; Craig Bierko as Max Baer, the reigning champion that Braddock must dare face. Bierko has a great screen presence that draws the viewer to him. A quality possessed by veteran actors Robert Duvall and Anthony Hopkins and newcomers Clive Owen and Ryan Gosling.The revelation of the picture is from the Oscar snubbed actor for Sideways, Paul Giamatti. Playing Joe Gould, James' boxing trainer could be a very cliché role for any performer taking it yet Giamatti elevates the role and material. Joe's charisma, laughter and beautiful soul captures the audience first frame of his presence. Giamatti might be one of the finest actors underused in every way. We wait to see what his future could possibly hold.Director Ron Howard has a beautiful style of film-making but for some reason, he doesn't always seem to peak out of his films like Spielberg, Coppola, or Eastwood. Howard has a tough time with it and you seem to feel that it's the actors that do the grunt of the work. I'm not sure if that's a bunch of crap I'm talking but its just something I feel about Howard.The cinematography and film editing are definitely that standout technical aspects of the film. Add that with Thomas Newman's score and you have a visually stunning piece of cinema. An enjoyable time of Crowe boxing around indeed.Grade: ***½/****",9,1,2,22 October 2007
The Simpsons Movie," Simpsons doesn't deliver
","Depending what generation you're from, you can appreciate 'The Simpsons' on different levels. I can remember watching one of first episodes with my older siblings when I was five and thinking, this is the funniest show on the planet. Watching it nearly twenty years later, it has lost its spark and everyone waited in fright to see which 'Simpsons' we were going to be seeing. The film however lies somewhere in between classic Simpsons and broken down, fireless Simpsons. So I guess the viewer got mediocre Simpsons.The Simpsons Movie starts off fantastic with our Itchy and Scratchy humor that we love but after the first twenty minutes are over, Homer and the gang takes a small decline into general second-rate comedy. When Homer accidentally pollutes Springfield's water supply and the government encases the whole town in a glass dome, the people turn on them and declares them enemies.The story is just so ordinary and average that it leaves the classic Simpsons fans, a little dead in the dirt and even worse disappointed. As middle-of-the-road as it may be, Oscar will surely take it on the Animated Feature film list but with the highly acclaimed Ratatouille, Simpsons are left Oscar-less and stuck at the Emmys unless there's a sequel in James L. Brooks' future.This critic is left a little disenchanted and sorry for The Simpsons Movie and only hopes the best for the family.Grade: **½/****",6,2,2,25 September 2007

","Director Jason Reitman, that has brought us great Indie classics such as Thank You for Smoking and Juno has crafted his most personal and most effective portrait to date, Up in the Air. The film stars George Clooney, also giving his most intimate and beautiful performance of his career, as Ryan, a traveling 'Firing-Man,' who plans on racking up as much frequent flyer miles as he can. Completely void of human connection and emotion, even from his two sisters, one of which is getting married, Ryan seems completely content with his choice of living. All seems well until he meets his female version in the beautiful and charismatic Alex, played with sexual force and intensity by Vera Farmiga. At the same time, a change at his job makes him acquire a student, Natalie, played with sensitivity and vigor by Anna Kendrick, to learn the ropes of the business before potentially making a devastating change to Ryan's way of life.The film, based on the book of the same title, is a moving and witty piece of cinema. The line deliveries given are some of the best liners of the year. The adaptation by Reitman and Sheldon Turner is of beautiful and social importance in today's day and age. There was no better time than now, to bring a film like this to the table. Dana E. Glauberman's crisp and precise editing sets the pace as we travel with Ryan in this beautiful account. Reitman's direction shows he's a force to be reckoned with and should be in full blown force for Oscar consideration along with the adaptation shared with Turner.George Clooney, who's having one hell of a year along with his other comedic turn in The Men Who Stare at Goats, gains sympathy and emotion from the viewer, which up until now, Clooney had always struggled for. The role is right up Clooney's alley and with humorous strength, conveys the pain and loneliness of an otherwise charming man successfully.Vera Farmiga as Alex, is a beautiful as she is dark, and as sexy as she is ugly. Farmiga has finally landed the right role that, in her years of wrong place at the wrong time, should land her a first-time Oscar nomination. Never showing her hand, Farmiga keeps and earns your trust, attention, and admiration. It's one of the most divisive and structurally brilliant supporting turns of the year. Seemingly not playing with a full deck is Natalie, played most beautifully by Anna Kendrick, who portrays brains don't equal smart choices. Kendrick earns your care and concern for the character, as she follows Ryan around and constantly badgers him about happiness and love, she naïvely and courageously shows the tenderest parts of youth in today's world. Kendrick will likely be sitting along side Farmiga at Oscar's ceremony.Jason Bateman, playing Craig Gregory, the boss in charge, is amusing in a brief but memorable role. Amy Morton and Melanie Lynsky, who play Ryan's sisters, are valuable and sufficient enough to book end a wonderful tale. Danny McBride, an outstanding comic talent to watch, is as good as ever. And finally, in otherwise cameos, Sam Elliott and the great Zack Galifianakis are uproarious in their respective roles.This could very well be the crowd and critical pleaser of the year. It has what the 2004 film Sideways lacked, the emotional edge. Long after the film, you take these characters home with you and remind yourself of its authenticity in delivery, poise, and premise. Up in the Air is one of the best pictures of the year. ****/****",9,189,284,28 November 2009
Atonement," Beautiful canvas, beautiful colors, beautifully directed, beautifully acted
","From Joe Wright, the acclaimed director Pride and Prejudice comes his sophomore effort, Atonement based on the best selling novel by Ian McEwan. The film tells the story of Robbie and Cecilia, two young lovers torn apart by a false accusation of young Briony, Cecilia's sister. Robbie is sent to prison and in exchange for his incarceration, he must serve in World War II for his freedom.This is technically and visually the best film of the year. The stunning cinematography by Seamus McGarvey which acts like a photographer capturing the glimpses at the doors of heaven are absolutely breathtaking. The scenery and images are all but believable as we are thrown into a time of passion, betrayal, corruption, and torment.Now, I've never been a fan of British Cinema like the next avid Oscar watcher. Never cared for Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice wasn't terrible but nothing great, Howard's End and The Remains of the Day are mediocre to me. The reason I say this is that I was feeling the way I felt about those films with Atonement for the first half. I thought was melodrama to the extreme and overly emotional and presented that it disengaged the viewer from the picture. As the film continued I felt myself being closely drawn to the performance of James McAvoy very reminiscent of Jude Law's performance in Cold Mountain but with more depth, more life, more response.The melodrama continued and all of a sudden, comes this powerful last third of Atonement. Romola Garai who plays the Briony at 18 who's performance is very responsive and spacious heats up the screen with poise and control. Garai who hasn't had success in with mediocre performances and films like Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights and Vanity Fair finally is given some scenery to chew. Inhabiting the guilt and despondency of Briony was quite a task and sincere effort to bring her to the viewer with aggression yet subtlety was great.Keira Knightley who has teamed up with Joe Wright before in his directorial debut is beautiful in elegance but nothing extroverted that makes you take her with you after the film ends. Her Romeo & Juliet story with McAvoy is the most tender parts of the movie however, disappointment is the only feeling I can describe to you, the reader, with her work here. With expectations so high maybe that was her downfall with myself.Saoirse Ronan who has been reaping all the buzz is a talent to watch in the future but alas, I can't wallow in the glory of Ronan without feeling Garai is missing out on the glory. It is the best child performance of the year by far and her curiosity and crush on Robbie is special to the film; Ronan holds her own against the other talents in the film.In the end, it's the wonderful veteran actress Vanessa Redgrave that steals the show and inhabits Older Briony which singled handedly saves the film in its entirety. All the melodrama and over zealous antics of the film were summed up in the finale and because of Redgrave it all made me swallow it a whole lot better. Redgrave holds all the tragedy of the film in her brief and final moments that encourage all of us to share in the love for all humanity. Thinking about all the things that you regret and wish you could change is the solution to the film Atonement. Atonement in the sense of the word, is needed in all our lives as the one thing that is a necessity but everyone hesitates to take. The film is a work of art.Grade: ***½/****",8,4,6,16 December 2007
