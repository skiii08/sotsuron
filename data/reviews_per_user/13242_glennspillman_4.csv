10 Cloverfield Lane," The psychotic comforts of home.
","I did like the film, even thought it was a bit slow at times. I did have a question though about why someone would be chained up if they were trying to be helped. Goodman plays his role well, and I am sure there is a bit of truth behind the person that he plays. The two men at first seemed to be in cahoots with each other, but it is soon realized that Goodmans character was an extreme alpha male with a bit of a complex. 95% of the film takes place in one location, and I like those kinds of films. The acting was spot on, the effects seemed good, and it leaves a person asking the question....is this a hostage situation, or were the words of Goodmans character the truth?",8,0,0,5 March 2017
Sleepy Hollow," A great story with a nice twist.
","I have watched all of Tim Burton's films, and this one did not disappoint. Burton lives in an obscure world of his own and you can see that in his work. Not only in the typed of movies that he does, but also in the style of the sets. Sleepy Hallow is an age old tale, but Burton puts his own flavor in the way the film is made. Even though Christopher Doesn't really have any lines in the film, other that a hush and a few screams, he put on a nice and eerie performance. Crane was in town investigating these mysterious murders, but there was a more underlying sinister backstory. This is where the twist comes in. In this movie, you as the viewer are trying to pin point what is really going on, but, things aren't always what they seen. I suggest that you pay close attention to the plot and to each character. In my reviews I try to never give out to much information about the movie, because I hate spoilers. Sleepy Hallow is a movie that you can watch over and over again, and with each viewing you will learn something new.",10,0,2,3 October 2016
The Silence of the Lambs," A well done thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat.
","This movie will keep you guessing throughout the entire film. It dives into the mind of a man who's thought pattern is far from normal. Although in his mind, he thinks his actions are within the scope of normality. The movie also dives into the realm of sexism. Even in the beginning of the film, the female FBI agent is being faced with male chauvinistic behavior within her entire office. She is basically set up to fail, but with her vigor and desire to find out the truth, she foils every effort by her superiors that try and use her at a patsy. Even though Hannibal appears to be helping the female FBI agent, he is also playing a game of his own. Hannibal is locked up 24 hours a day, so the agent is really the only toy that he gets to play with.",9,0,1,10 September 2016
Goodfellas," Got to see it.
","There is really nothing bad at all that I can say about this film. The acting is great, the special FX are great, and the story is great. This film was based on Henry Hill, a mobster that lived the life since he was a teenager. He did great, all up until he took a wrong turn and did something that the mob highly frowned upon. The film has wonderful camera shots, great back story, and a film that I study as a student. This is a must watch film, and something that I think you can watch over and over again. You feel for each character in the movie, and can't help but wonder what it was like to live in the glory days of mob life.",10,1,2,15 March 2017
