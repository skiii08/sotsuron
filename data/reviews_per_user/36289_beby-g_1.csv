Sucker Punch," This movie is not cheesy like they seem to be.
","I really like this movie. I saw it about 2 days ago and it was great. This movie was not all about action. I was impressed by the way it presented stories and the dark tone. All of the soundtracks did fit the movie. You can feel related to the characters easily especially Babydoll, Sweet Pea and Rocket though you don't know their backgrounds much. I even can't stop thinking about what happened in the movie until now. People who don't understand or get the messages hidden in it may find this movie boring.What makes me like it more is how much effort the actors put into making this. If you want to know what I mean, you should watch some Behind the scenes videos on Youtube.Sucker Punch's not cheesy like they first look or seem to be. You have to watch it for yourself.",10,4,10,29 March 2011
