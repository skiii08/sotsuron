Angels & Demons," Very interesting film with complex story line
","After hearing about this films release and good reviews about it's prequel (The Da Vinci Code) I had high expectations when going to watch Angels and Demons, and I wan't disappointed....This film follows a Harvard university Symbologist, Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) on his quest to prevent the murders of Catholic Cardinals. This fast pace thriller takes you on a tour or Rome and the Vatican exploring churches, cathedrals and famous monuments. I have to admit, this film took 2-3 watches to understand fully. Writer Dan Brown put some immense time and effort into writing the book, and he did not fail to impress.For anyone who has watched Da Vince code, has an interest in history, or just likes fast paced thriller/action/drama films, I would strongly recommend this film.",9,0,0,24 November 2011
