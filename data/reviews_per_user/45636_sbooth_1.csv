Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A big mess
","'The Phantom Menace' is worth seeing for the effects (and I doubt that most fans *care* whether it's worth seeing or not) but the plot is a big mess, the characterization is profoundly weak, and the climactic battle scene -- four battles! count them, four! -- proves that more is not always better.",3,0,1,15 June 1999
