The Ring," An Interesting Movie... Interesting Concept.
","I found the film very intriguing being that the concept of this type of killer video is relatively new.  I've seen the original Japanese version of the film and find both of them delightful to watch.  The American remake added other storyline which is fine because it adds another dimension to the horror/drama.  Instead of just spirit photography, this is a form of spiritual rage video where the outcome is horrible death.  Very interesting and different.If one wants to see another movie that had to do with a kind of killer video then one should view VIDEODROME.",9,1,1,13 May 2003
Cloverfield," Highly Unusual Film!!!
",Back in the fall of 2007 when I first saw the trailer for CLOVERFIELD I was very intrigued. The trailer was high tension. I was itching to see this movie.I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED!!! I truly love this movie. Seen it three times!!! It was made to look like a video retrieved from what was once Central Park here in NYC. The movie starts with the U.S. Government blurb and logo. Its apparent that the footage was being viewed secretly by top military brass and members of our government. This the video begins. Its lighthearted and in many places funny before the attack. Its about one of the main character's Bon Voyage party and some of the insanity that takes place during the party. The there is the great explosion and insuring 'attack' upon Manhattan. This is not a monster I've seen before which makes this extremely satisfying. Monster is NOT a reptile.I understand the original title of the film was going to be PARASITE. I see why. WOW!!! But the military designation is even better.Congratulations to Matt Reeves and JJ Abrams for bring us a highly original film.,9,2,6,21 January 2008
Alien vs. Predator," An Extremely Interesting Treatment of both Franchises
","I thought this was a very excellent treatment and bringing together of the two franchises. Of course this movie is based on the extended novels, comics and video game. I found the idea extremely intriguing and entertaining. Sanaa Lathan is excellent as the Expedition Guide to the newly discovered subterranean pyramid where the Hunter/Warrior race battled the creature as a 'rite of passage' test for young warriors. Her later teaming up with the Hunter was done tastefully so that it didn't appear corny. The Elder Hunter Chief honoring her at the end for her brave stand and fighting along side the slain Hunter against the Alien was a wonderful touch.This opens the door to a host of new sequels and possible TV movies based on all of this creative material.I congratulate Paul W.S. Anderson on this excellent film.",9,1,2,1 February 2005
The Mist," Stephen King a la Lovecraft
","I am not generally crazy about Stephen King movies, but this one I thoroughly enjoyed. I've never read the novella, but if what I saw is actually in the novella then this is an excellent blending of H.P. Lovecraft into Stephen King.The acting was excellent. Thomas Jane fit into this roll very easily and his performance is highly believable. All of the actors were excellent. All. Marcia Gay Harden is excellent as the fanatical evangelist wannabe. Like I said ALL the actors were excellent.The special effects are stupendous.The atmosphere is of excellent quality with the very minimal music input made even more suspenseful and frightening. The music at the end of the movie added to pathos and the otherworldly divine and cosmic retribution atmosphere.This is a very very powerful movie.",9,0,6,26 November 2007
The Matrix Reloaded," A Most Excellent and Entertaining Film
",What can one say.  It was purely entertaining and even educational in some political way.On the human level I give it an A+ for human racial diversity.  I have never seen a film that had as much racial diversity in it.  All together in a single scene.  And nearly every age group.An excellent film.,9,0,0,21 May 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," One of the All Time Great Trilogies
",Matrix Reloaded is visually stunning as it is philosophically and psychologically challenging for the viewer.  It will go down in the movie history as one of the great theatrical trilogies of all time.,9,1,2,29 October 2003
Signs," The Best Invasion Story to Date.
","This is one of the greatest alien invasion stories to date.  An excellent execution of story and tension using the well known crop signs that have in reality appeared in many parts of the world, Shyamalan spins a story of incredible power.  Mel Gibson playing the part of a minister who loses his faith after the horrific death of his wife and Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of his younger brother were powerful characters of the movie.  This is war of the worlds taken to a higher level that only M. Night Shyamalan can take it.Congradulations Mr. Shyamalan on a very excellently executed film.",9,0,1,5 August 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," A Fabulous Film
","Although I read the books many years ago, I have always had a fondness for the third book: Return of the King.Peter Jackson's treatment of the trilogy and the end story especially is something for future history.  It is an extremely sensitive and insightful translation of the story from book to silver screen.  I enjoyed every moment of it.The ending is a golden moment and the care and sweetness of the film ending does the book justice.This is film history.Congradulations Peter Jackson.",10,1,2,18 December 2003
