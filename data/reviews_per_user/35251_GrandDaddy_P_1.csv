Requiem for a Dream," Disturbing Scene
",The message of the movie is great but there was a scene that disturbed me a lot... homos doing each other... what the f*ck they didn't have to show that sh*t.But the rest of the movie is excellent. It shows how drugs can really destroy one's life. Most people who tried to use drugs do not have control of themselves and the substance. Instead they get controlled by it not them controlling drugs.I saw this movie with my cousins after the year it was released.Great message.There was a very disturbing scene. 2 Homos doing anal. Disgusting StuffThe moral of the story is don't do anything illegal.I don't recommend this stuff to be watched by homo phobics.Yeah...Whatever...Don't Watch it!!! It's just about how drugs like heroin coke etc destroyed everybody's lives,5,1,3,1 December 2006
