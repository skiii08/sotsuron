The Avengers," Brilliant! Unfaultable! AND They Should Do A Dr. Strange Movie
","MY TOTALLY ORIGINAL SUGGESTION, is they do a Dr. Strange movie, why not get the rights to that? While it might seem minor, a bit of knowledge of Dr. Strange helped give me a more solid picture of the Marvel universe when the glistening cube was shown 'connecting different parts of the universe' in this Avengers movie (definitely going to see it a 2nd time TONIGHT, AS SOON AS POSS, at least a 2nd time), Dr. Strange's weird dimensions being that other side of the universe.......especially the early Steve Ditko version, often with Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D. as the other half of the comic.......CGI representations of Steve Ditko's surreal intertwinings of dimensions would be fantastic, ESPECIALLY IN 3D!Otherwise, totally incredible film, loved everything.....couldn't't really fault it. A Hawkeye film would be cool. By The Crimson Bands of Cytorak, that was a brilliant film, Joss. Wonder if Keanu Reeves would be a good suggestion for a Dr. Strange?",10,1,3,29 April 2012
