Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," For the brain dead. Dumb & Dumber 3 renamed Borat.
","Recently I bought a game for the PSP called Crash Bandicoot for my six year old son. He managed to get to a certain level then couldn't stop laughing and kept saying, 'look Daddy, look Daddy'. Intrigued i had to look and saw a character pull his pants down to reveal his underpants. My son just couldn't stop laughing. Relevance. This is the exact level of humour you'll discover watching Borat. You'll either have to be brain dead or under the mental age of 10 to enjoy this film. There's absolutely no original jokes, if you can call someone ATTEMPTING to redefine new levels of stupidity a joke. Comedy exploiting cultural differences has been done so many times before and to better effect. If you want to see real comedians look out for these actors/films then get back to me about how funny you really think Borat is!Dan Akroyd, John Belushi, James Belushi, Eddie Murphy (Raw & Delirious, Trading Places, Coming To America etc), Jim Carey (Dumb & Dumber, etc), Peter Kay Live (UK), Chris Rock 'Never Scared', Richard Prior (Stir Crazy, Brewster's Millions etc), John Candy, Smith and Jones (UK double act), The Monty Python crew (John Cleese, Eric Idle, Peter Cook etc), 'The Carry On' movies, Rowan Atkinson (Mr Bean and 'Not The Nine O'Clock News: Gerald, The Gorilla'), Police Academy 1-3, Robin Williams (actor not singer) from Good Morning Vietnam and Ms Doubtfire etc, Goldie Hawn, Meryl Streep & Bruce Willis (Death Becomes her) etc............",1,15,36,9 November 2006
