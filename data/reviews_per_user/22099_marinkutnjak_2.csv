Ford v Ferrari," Great story with even greater characters
","A spectacular journey filled with action, excitement, complex human relationships and great characters.",8,0,1,27 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Convoluted, fan servicing and maybe satisfying.
","Desperate to correct mistakes from The Last Jedi and satisfy the fans, the movie floats in the swamp of convoluted plot, fan fiction, cheap tricks, big (and sometimes cheesy) reveals, tested formulas, fast storytelling and big action scenes. However The Rise of Skywalker offers some great character moments and semisatisfying conclusions of the Skywalker saga.",7,2,8,19 December 2019
