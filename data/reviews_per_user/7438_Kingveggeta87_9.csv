Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Bill steals the show
","After I saw Kill Bill Vol.1 the Friday Part 2 came out in theaters, I was itching for a chance to see how it all ends.  I finally got a chance to check it out a couple of weeks later and I was blown away.  We don't get jumbled up and unanswered questions like we did with The Matrix Revolutions (Andy and Larry, please take note!!!).  Instead, we get a perfectly wrapped present that ties everything down nicely.But we all know that this film would not be as great if it didn't have David Carradine, who finally shows his face as Bill.  His cool exterior and excellent humurous lines drive the whole second half of the film.  I was about to cry when he dies in the end, yes he was that great.To make a long story short. GO SEE KILL BILL PART 2, THEN GET IN LINE AND SEE IT AGAIN!!!!!",10,0,1,13 May 2004
Troy," Better than expected, this movie actually rocked
","I had heard plenty of unsavory new surrounding Troy since it came out last May. But after seeing it for the first time, all I can say is, why? Troy actually turned out to be a pretty enjoyable film. Despite a couple of flaws (Instead of ten years, the greeks take Troy in 2 weeks, (laugh, laugh). The performances, especially from Brad Pitt and Eric Bana, were superb and the visual effects, awesome. Cute girls and some of the best hand to hand battles i have seen in a good long while. And the ending will leave you in tears even if you know how it ends already.See it, love it, or hate it. Either way, Troy has my vote ***/****",9,0,4,7 January 2005
Lost in Translation," Lost in an amazing movie
","I have said it before and i'll say it again, If there's one place you want to go to to have a spiritual epihany, Japan is the place.  That is the comment that came to my mind after I first saw Lost in Translation.  This movie was fun and inspiring.  Bill Murray and Scarlett JoHansson are made for each other, and Bill Murray is still funny as hell.  The Japanese setting only added to the majesty of the film.  Best part: Bob and Charolette's night on the town with Charlie Brown and crew.  Doesn't this film make you want to visit Japan for yourself.  This flick is hands down one of the best films of 2003.  If LOTR3 had not come out then, this film would have won best picture.  Ok, I'll shut up now. Final score 10/10",10,0,1,1 June 2004
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Robots, Guns and Hot Chicks??? What more can you ask for!!!
","I just saw this movie today and man was I blown away. T3 has everything a guy could ask for, hense the title. But where to start, hmmmm...Let's start with Arnold. The original Terminator really puts life into a movie franchise that has been missing for almost 12 years. He really blew the movie away with his incredible acting and even better fighting scenes. The new John Conner, Nick Stahl, may seem like an odd and unknown choice at first, but he is really worthy of the role of Earth's future leader. He really breathed life into the role, plus he didn't sound like a girl when he screamed. Together, Arnold and Nick really make a great onscreen team.But moving on to the main reason the movie was so great, the girls, Claire Daines and , especially, Kristanna Loken, were down right hot. Claire Daines replaces the empty role of the fighting machine that Linda Hamilton was in the first two movies. But even her good looks couldn't compete with Kristanna Loken's sexy killing machine that is the TX. Armed with a multi weapon arm, a shape-shifting body, an inflatable chest, etc. Kristanna really proved that the new female Terminator is nothing to be triffled with.Overall, this movie rocked and is definantly a movie that needs to be seen by any sci-fi or Terminator fan. MAKE SURE IT BEATS OUT SINBAD AND LEGALLY BLONDE II!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Good Day....",10,0,0,2 July 2003
Van Helsing," This movie sucks
","The one line summary basically sums up my feelings about this film.  I went into Van Helsing hoping that it would be a great way to start off the long awaited summer movie season.  Instead, I got the ultimate peice of S*** that is not worth viewing even once. (I snuck out and went to see some of Kill Bill at one point.)One way to describe Van Helsing is that it is lke a Johnny Depp movie, the only reason you might want to see it is because of Depp's prescence. In this case, that honor goes to leading man Hugh 'Wolverine' Jackman.  he does a pretty good job playing the average demon hunter.  Other than that, well, the film is basically an accident waiting to happen.Terrible acting and sub-par effects don't come close to the amount of familiar scenery and concepts that I have seen in other films.  If you've seen Blade, Blade II, Mortal Kombat 2 and The Lord of the Rings 3, you've seen alot of Van Helsing before.In short, this flick should be shipped directly to video & DVD and used for target practice.  Definantly one of the worst movies ever made.P.S. Richard Roxburgh needs some help with his Transylvanian accent.",1,8,17,13 May 2004
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," The Best Movie of 2004
","Harry, Hermione, and Ron are back. And better than ever. Alfonso Curon really surprised me with this peice of work that is Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Alot was cut, sadly, but that was only to help propel the story futher (I hope we get some kind of director's cut or  S**t load of deleted scenes on the DVD). The big three are at there best. That goes double for Dan and Emma, this is hands down their best preformances yet (Plus, Emma has never been so sexy). It is going to take alot for Any other film this year to impress me. I can't wait for Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. Harry Potter is here to stay.My final vote 10/10 stars",10,0,0,7 June 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Bad Ass Live Action Anime
","Ok, so it is not an actual Anime series, but this movie was pure genius. You have got to give Quinten Tarintino his props.  And this was only Part 1.Uma Thurman is excellent as the Bride & the rest of the cast is also Class A, especially David Caradinne as the cool and mysterious Bill.  That action sequences are some of the best I have seen in a while, bloody and down right cool.  If you love samurai action and the scenery of Japan, you'll definantly love this film.  Other than that, you have to see it for yourself to see how great it is.  See it, then go see Part 2 right away. This two-part story arc is what The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions wanted to be like.",10,0,2,13 May 2004
The Matrix Reloaded," Reloaded, but it has a few bugs to work out for Part 3
","First off, I'd just like to say, whoa. This movie really kept me urging for more Matrix. The highway chase is a sequence to be reckoned with. Plus, Neo fighting the Smith's really impressed me in terms of ultimate fighting action. Unfortuately, it does have a few bugs to work out. The speeches given by the Supreme Councilor and especially the Architect really made me sleepy. It really is a waste of time. However, if you watch the parody done by MTV, featuring Justin Timberlake, Sean William Scott, and Will Farrel, you will appreciate the speeches better.See the movie, buy the Animatrix, and buy the Enter the Matrix Video game, and keep yourself occupied. There are still months to go until The Matrix 3. But those three items should keep any Matrix fan busy.",9,0,0,23 June 2003
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Back and Better than ever the force is...
","It's been a couple of weeks since I saw Revenge of the Sith at a midnight premiere in D.C. and I've been struggling to debate whether it was good enough to dethrone my all time Star Wars fav: Empire Strikes Back. And it does my friends, it does.Revenge of the Sith is comprised of three essential components, all from the original trilogy: the fun of Star Wars; the darkness of The EmpireStrikes Back; and the sheer sense of closure of Return of the Jedi. All questions that have plagued fans for years are answered. The cast pulls off the ultimate ensemble performance, considering that they had a lot to make up for because of the disappointments that were The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones. Visuals are top notch, the lightsaber battles are the stuff of legends, and Hayden Christiensen redeems himself for his poor acting in EPII by becoming the ultimate bad ass we know to be Darth Vader.My hats off to George Lucas, he knows how to cap off an awesome story. Just goes to show you that old dogs are still superior in film-making.10/10-Anyone who says otherwise, there's something wrong with you...",10,4,12,30 May 2005
