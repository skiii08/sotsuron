The Blair Witch Project," The Pet Rock of Movies
","There may never have been a movie marketing campaign as smart in it's strategy as the one for 'The Blair Witch Project'. You come out slapping yourself saying, 'If only I'd thought of it!' Imagine, making something out of nothing!The actual movie (for lack of a better term) is a poorly shot, endlessly tedious hoax, a fraudulent pile of hokum that feeds right into that immature teenage quest for 'an event' that never has anything to do with art or entertainment. P.T. Barnum is smiling somewhere as he shouts, 'This way to the egress!'",Null,0,0,4 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Over-produced, over-hyped and over-long
","Although I am not a Star Wars fan, I have to admit that the first three films (especially The Empire Strikes Back) have a visceral kick to them in their loving recreation of old movie serial formulas. The latest installment, however, is a tired, over-produced video game that lacks energy, invention and thrills. The film is poorly paced and scripted and the actors so drained of any emotion they fit right in with the rather dull computer generated visuals. George Lucas has always been a clunky movie-maker, with none of the wit and energy of his buddy Steven Spielberg, but here he seems bankrupt of ideas. I always suspected that he was making this baloney up as he went along, but I think any one of the terminally adolescent fanatics who call this dopey stuff their religion could have cobbled together a better story. The only thing that kept me awake was Ob-Ewan McGregor's very credible imitation of Sir Alec. I think I'll pass on the next two. If this is the future of movies, I'll get off the merry-go-round here and go back to reading.",Null,0,1,30 May 1999
Life Is Beautiful," Mr. Hulot's Holocaust
","The praise for this forced, strident comedy is puzzling. This film, which is one long wince,  looks like 'Seven Beauties' as seen through the eyes of Jacques Tati. A serious subject does not a good movie make. Like 'Il Postino', 'Life is Beautiful' is another mediocre Italian-movie-for-export. We miss you Federico!",Null,10,21,26 December 1998
