10 Cloverfield Lane," 10 Cloverfield Lane...eh
","Well I don't know how to start this review. John Goodman did a great job I guess is one good thing about the movie. This film or movie was more than predictable and honestly would have been a lot more enjoyable if the movie wasn't so desperate to try to scare people which in the long run made it corny for me. John Goodman's character as Howard that was basically the biggest conspiracy theory and passive aggressive guy was nailed really well. And the ridiculousness of the convenient escapes for the main character in her problematic situations was honestly just too much. All in all, this movie made me feel that conspiracy theories just got grabbed and just got slammed in the movie. Better luck next time.",5,2,5,16 March 2016
It," Ehh...
","Just finished 'IT' (DO NOT READ THIS CONTAINS SPOILERS) and I have to say I am tired of 'scary' movies with happy endings. This movie was predictable and clichÃ© on certain parts as well. Don't get me wrong I jumped once or twice maybe even three times with this movie, but everything was way too predictable. The start of this movie made me feel it was going to be blood and gore and kids would die always. By the middle with the different experiences I was able to tell this movie is not going to end badly its gonna be the same happy ending. Of course the ending was the girl and the guy getting their kiss....what a shame. Corny ending. As far as anything else the black guy FINALLY survived the entire movie only problem was his acting in certain scenes specifically when he tells his fear origin story.",5,19,36,9 September 2017
Training Day," Great movie
","This movie was great. It was an excellent performance by Denzel Washington! When watching this movie it was interesting to see Denzel be the corrupted cop attempting to corrupt the other cop and partner. Ethan Hawke also did an amazing job just learning what it's like to be in the hood and adapting to gangster culture. We also can see Denzel's character clearly was a man that lost his mind. It was interesting to see Snoop Dogg and Eva Mendez in this movie as well for a moment. I did not like the fact that the bad cop was the black guy, but realistically speaking I guess even the black cops are corrupted. It was interesting to see Jay the whole time be the good cop actually fighting for justice and you see how all corrupted people give you no choice but to be corrupted as well. Also, Denzel's character was very good in using lies and reverse psychology to control Jay's integrity. I loved seeing Jay gain not only his integrity back but he also kept his courage with him. I loved Lonzo's final speech and yelling with King Kong ain't got nothing on me. It was so enjoyable to watch the movie.",10,0,0,11 January 2018
Detroit," Loved it but man it was long
",Detroit was a very deep documentary. Its amazing to see that it was based on only 50 years ago. And how the police state was when there were riots. And its sad to see times hasn't changed that much! Police Brutality has never ended! The thing I didn't like about the movie was how one of the main characters gave up his singing career to join a church. It seems every black movie has black people riding god the whole time! Also this documentary showed me that there is no such thing as a good cop.,8,2,9,17 August 2017
Memento," Memento
",This movie had a very interesting start when I saw that the main character could not form new memories I was in shock. I thought it was very interesting that the main character tattooed the truth on himself or what he assumed to be true. I love how this movie showed Leonard in the fight for truth to his own memories that me may or may not have remembered. I love how the movie showed flash backs of his memories as well to combine in the suspense and confusion. This movie was excellently done by Christopher Nolan!,8,0,0,6 September 2017
Coraline," No buttons please
","This movie is a great one that shows that sometimes in reality we prefer a fantasy, but even a fantasy has its own dangers obviously. The only thing I did not like about the movie is its hard religious side to it. But besides that I have a child and I feel this movie could give nightmares like crazy. This movie also had an amazing connection with how fantasies can even affect our realities. In total this movie can give a morale to it that when given the choice between fantasy or reality, always choose reality which is safer in the long run.",9,1,2,7 May 2017
Ted," Ted is one of my favorite movies.
","This movie was absolutely hilarious from beginning to the end. Especially when their lives were them being older singing F you thunder you can suck my D you can't hurt me thunder cause you're just god's fart. That was too much I can't wait to see the second movie and hope its just as funny. I feel life is really good when you get to see a teddy bear take a hit from a bong. This movie was also hilarious because when Ted got hired at the job and he cursed out the manager and insulted him and from doing that he got a promotion, this movie just had me laughing terribly hard and had me holding my ribs. Finally, this movie had me laughing with the actors that played the creepy family that stole ted and did some really crazy things to him.",10,2,4,27 May 2015
Thor: Ragnarok," Wonderfully done!
","This movie was hilarious and enjoyable to watch. This movie was great in my opinion in many ways. First, the intro for the movie was perfect with Thor being captured and making jokes about it. Next, I loved the jokes in the movie with Thor being mostly incompetent with situations making him go from being a god to a human as a character. I loved the fight scene with Thor and The Hulk. I loved seeing Thor make trivial mistakes. This movie just had everything and a bag of chips. Seeing how Thor found out who he truly was I think was a great way to show character development. It was also pretty awesome to see Thor and Loki on the same team together and how they rebuilt their family relationship. I think it was awesome the hulk turned back to Bruce Banner because of black widow it shows that the Hulk has a huge soft spot for her and in general. It was also good to see the Hulk some personality as well from being a gladiator champion for two years. All, in all I loved the movie great job to all the actors in this movie and great job with the Stan Lee Cameo that made me cry of laughter.",9,2,10,3 November 2017
BlacKkKlansman," Fantastic movie
","This movie was excellent from start to finish. I didn't know if this movie would be so good, but I enjoyed the movie a lot of how it tackled black issues and it gave you a good 70s field to the movie. John David Washington and Adam Driver really knocked it out of the park with the fantastic acting and team work. This provided great history lessons on Jesse Washington and the pain he went through and showed how the work against the KKK had to get deleted by the chief of police for some reason, but they felt the black nationalist groups were more dangerous than the KKK which is a shame. However, I did love how Spike Lee ended this movie with showing how times is America hasn't really changed at all and how we still have a long way to go. But all in all I loved this movie!",10,10,20,14 August 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Loved this Spiderman Movie
",I loved this movie it was hilarious with the moments of people being exposed by his best friend and his friend would not stop asking him questions like 'dude do you lay eggs?' that line alone had a nerd like me in tears from laughing. I loved the connection between Peter Parker and Tony Stark basically wanting to be his best friend and his father. But I also like how Tony Stark was saving him and training him and he took the suit back from Peter and Peter learns the lesson that he does not need Tony Stark's invention suit to be a successful super hero. And he develops as a super hero by fighting for what's right and realizing sacrifices will have to be made if you want this lifestyle. My favorite part to this movie was the ending when his aunt may found out he was spiderman just like in the comic books.,9,1,4,17 August 2017
Suicide Squad," I loved Suicide Squad
",This movie was everything I was looking for or waiting for rather. I loved Will Smith as Dead-shot so much so that I had to save a picture of Dead-shot on my phone. Jared Leto played a great Joker and I love the new look on him and I thought he looked pretty cool. Then on top of that I loved Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn I really loved everything about her and the development as a psychopath who was actually pretty decent at fighting. I didn't like however the witch to the movie and how easy it was for her and her brother to get stopped by the Suicide Squad. I think that the movie was interesting that Batman was more in the movie than I expected him to be. I can't wait to see the next movie or challenge the Suicide Squad and there may be a league that gives justice to the system (pun intended). Great job its about time Hollywood.,8,0,2,29 August 2016
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," One Of The Best
","This Captain America was really good and actually had me kind of surprised. This movie had just the right amount of action, character development and an intense shock fused with a little bit of personal feelings getting involved. When this movie showed Captain America gaining advice from some old lady and turns out that was the love of his life that shocked me and even feel bad for the lady losing her love but realizing that he was still alive and young. What made the movie even more awesome is when he made a new friend and turns out that was Falcon in the making. What really was a huge surprising moment was when we found out that the Winter Soldier was actually Captain America's childhood best friend and when they were going through their final fight against each other, Captain America gave The Winter Soldier a quote from their childhood which made the Soldier come to his senses and they crashed together and the Winter Soldier even saved Captain America's life which was a beautiful thing, showing the power of true friends is stronger than any indoctrination.",10,0,1,27 May 2015
Justice League," I enjoyed this movie
","Justice League was a pretty good movie. I loved the movie and how all the costumes looked on the actors and makes me wish I had costumes like the flashes, batman's and cyborg. I loved the acting in the movie by all character's that were in the movie. When Superman came back to life and fought Cyborg, Wonder woman, and Batman all at once while simultaneously being able to see the Flash running at him. And seeing the Flash's reaction was so hilarious. I thought it was also, pretty cool with seeing Batman get his butt kicked by Superman. But I did not like how when Batman asked Alfred for help, it literally takes him 10 seconds to pop out of nowhere with Louis Lane to bring superman back to normal. I thought it was fun to see the Justice League work as a team and mostly seeing Superman beat all the enemies up on his own like we would expect, because he is a god. Finally, I love how at the end of the credits we get to see Lex Luther and Slade aka Deathstroke become a team.",8,1,4,20 November 2017
Lilo & Stitch," Great Minority Disney Movie
","I loved watching this movie again. I did not like the religious and superstitious innuendos. Daveigh Chase did a great job as a voice actor and so did Tia Carrere! I enjoyed lilo and stitch and how they showed the different culture. Also, with the lesson of Ohana. With Lilo and Stitch I like how Stitch is a heartless monster and he builds a relationship with Lilo to become a better monster and evolves into a better friend for Lilo who did not make any friends. I thought it was hilarious to see that they used Elvis Presley as Stitch's inspiration to try to become a model citizen. I saw this when I was younger and enjoyed this movies just as much. And seeing Stitch feel guilty showing that he was more than a monster, but was adapting to normal emotions that make us all a being. Finally I loved the ending where Stitch wanted to say good bye before he left and he was able to stay with Lilo.",9,0,0,9 August 2017
The Revenant," The Revenant
","Just saw the Revenant! Any movie with Leonardo Di Caprio is great really! The movie Revenant was good and it had a great amount of beautiful scenery that could make someone appreciate the movie even more. This movie definitely showed a powerful aspect of how human civilization was very primitive and it was literally sink or swim in those times. Aside from the serious religious banter garbage I really enjoyed the movie a lot. This movie also showed a lot of historical events with how whites/Caucasian people robbed everything from the Natives in the first place and how it caused an intense war between the Natives and whites. I honestly love the accuracy of what some whites did to the Natives, not because it's enjoyable because it's not but rather because all the facts are being shown. I also, really enjoyed seeing the main character develop as a character of strength and determination. I really enjoyed seeing the corruption in Christianity with their history and their messed up values like every other religion though! I am totally sick of the god references though from that movie. But all in all 8 out of 10",8,0,4,19 March 2016
Captain America: Civil War," Good movie
","Just saw Civil War in 3D. I think the movie was great. I loved Black Panther (obviously). I loved the combos by Captain America and Ant man. I'm sure everyone did. I was cheering for black panther to just beat everyone up and I was expecting to see Stan Lee and of course he came out of nowhere. I was expecting many deaths you know from the comic book. Captain America died in the 'civil' war in the comics. I really appreciated how the movie took it's time and how Spider-Man was formed through Iron Man. I also really liked the new costume for Spider-Man but I know for a fact I won't be watching Spider-Man reboots at all. Seems pointless by this point, but anyway this movie was great 9 out of 10! Finally, Hollywood making one good movie!",9,9,18,9 May 2016
Beasts of No Nation," Good movie
","The movie of Beasts Of No Nation was a very good movie in my opinion. There was too much mention of god and too much showing of Jesus, but it definitely not only gave me an understanding that we can be our own biggest enemies but also about how serious colonism really is and how intense it is in Africa. It brings many thoughts that while I am relaxing there could possibly be some one suffering in Africa. The motherland of what made every country great with their natural resources. This is truly heartbreaking. I loved seeing Idris Elba in this movie his acting was really awesome. I was really upset to see that people from the same nation would attack each other off of assumptions. This movie taught me a lot about colonization and really makes me hope colonization ends soon in Africa.",10,3,4,12 December 2015
Get Out," Beautifully Made Peele
","Just finished watching Get Out the movie. Warning there will be spoilers. First let me say if you seen this movie you're probably never going to be in an interracial relationship again in your life ever. Jordan Peele really killed this movie in a great and fantastic way. Second, let me say this movie will bring you through the emotion's of stress, anger and happiness. Finally, this movie had a deep connection with organ trafficking. For example, we don't know where organs of black people go they just tend to disappear. I.E. Kendrick Johnson. People say this movie was prejudice against white's when there was no racist terms said about white people. The facts is that organ trafficking 7 out of 10 is for white people. I'll leave it there. Great movie .",10,8,18,2 March 2017
22 Jump Street," Could use some work
","So this movie could have been a lot better. I did appreciate the recap of the first movie, but for some reason this second one didn't really have me entertained. The movie was kinda cliché and showed how karma happens with Jonah not being the cool kid and Channing being the cool kid as oppose to the first one. This movie needed better jokes and a lot less puns. For example the 'giant cube of ice' kinda made me cringe a little bit. As I continued to watch the movie I thought things were going to be a lot better, but in my opinion the movie got worse and worse. I really tried to see the comedy in the whole thing, but it wasn't really getting to me. As much, as the movie had the silly parts and the bad jokes it could have used some work. The money could have been used to make a better movie than this.",1,3,5,15 July 2015
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Could've been so much better
","This movie was very interesting, but a lot of things happened that made this movie hit it's own breaking point. I would say the series should stop being continued and hopefully its left alone. I know a lot of people enjoyed this movie, but a lot of unrealistic impossible things have happened in this movie and should probably start getting fixed.",6,0,0,17 December 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy," Guardians Of the Awesome Galaxy
","This movie was very funny and filled with good material and character development. I do not like the actress for Gamora, but besides that the movie passed my expectations by far. Most movies with WWE actors that I saw so far have really sucked box office and acting wise. At first I didn't want to see the movie until I heard from friends that the movie was actually pretty good. I had a nice time watching the movie and loved how Thanos was and how Rocket was so funny and enjoyable. I love the premise of Groot just being able to speak to Rocket through saying 'I am Groot' and most things were hilarious. Batista as Drax actually turned out pretty well and funny with the strength, the literacy and the seriousness of his character. Gamora with self discipline. Peter Quill as the Starlord doing a whole bunch of funny, stupid and psychotic things had me laughing and enjoying the movie that much more. If I could see this movie again I would. So to Batista, maybe your acting skills lie within acting as fictional characters that have a total short tempered personality. Good luck and can't wait to see the second movie!",8,1,4,27 May 2015
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Age Of Ultron
",This movie was very fun and enjoyable for me. I enjoyed every part of this movie except for one. The part I didn't enjoy was the fact that the Hulk got knocked out by Iron Man. And that bothers me because the angrier the Hulk gets the stronger he becomes he should have killed Iron Man. But that's something I could look past. I did enjoy the character development of Ultron and how he tried to play the aspect of god and really believed that the answer to peace was no organic life on earth. Kinda brings me back to the Mass Effect days. I really enjoyed Quicksilver and his sister when they began to help the Avengers that was pretty cool. I also loved the jokes that they were all making on Captain America about him not liking people cursing also I really enjoyed seeing the Ultron get his butt kicked by the Hulk. BUT What I really thought was stupid was Black Widow and The Hulk tried to runaway together and love each other. I am also kinda mad that the Hulk just left the Avengers and basically committed suicide. I feel there shouldn't have been a love connection between those two in the first place.,10,1,6,27 May 2015
Don't Breathe," Great movie
","Stephen Lane just made me understand how many of our main natural senses are good and bad for us. I loved the creativity of making a blind man have more enhanced senses than others because his blindness causes him to be more experienced in his other senses. And the fact that he had the training of a war veteran made the movie even more intense. This movie has been one for the ages with all the other movies that were considered suspenseful and just basically flat lined and ended up being a waste of money, but this movie truly made up for a lot and I would say Fede Alvarez needs to make more suspenseful movies, because that was creative and great planning and everything. I do wish the movie ended with the this psychology ill blind man ended up killing all the characters, but I can't wait to see the spin off if there will be one. Truthfully the only thing I did not like was the whole Atheist and religious thing with basically trying to generalize Atheists as sick evil people and that's not the case, but besides that I love the movie and just hope there is left mention of god and beliefs and just focuses on the suspense of the movie.",9,8,17,29 August 2016
Mudbound," MudBound
","I loved the narration in the movie to keep us informed in what was going on in this movie. I thought seeing this movie in the time frame was in was also, very interesting. I did think the beginning was weird like the husband was a man that loves to watch his woman dancing with other people. It was also funny watching the wife fall for the black veteran. It was also interesting to see that segregation wasn't that important in the different countries. It was rough seeing that we would have to apologize for speaking out to the oppressors at any moment. It was also rough to see them judge this white guy for shaking the black man's hand. Although there were some boring parts in the movie it still kept me watching. It was interesting seeing the guy become friends with black veteran with a super racist grandfather that basically ended up torturing black people. I loved the ending of the movie was a nice ending that the black veteran ended up being happy with his family.",8,2,7,24 November 2017
Hitch," I wish Hitch was real haha
","I just finished watching Hitch for the second time and it was my first time as an adult. I have to say this movie was excellent in my opinion. This movie shows people that love is obtainable with total opposites and how they can be the same in other ways. I however, gave up on love, but the concept of the movie was just a nice beautiful thing to watch. I really loved the fact that Kevin Smith danced to Usher's 'Yeah' song and Will Smith said 'Don't EVER do that again'. It really had me cracking up the movie had a good sense of comedy and even still compared to the movies today is considerably better. Will Smith and Eva Mendes did such a great job in this movie working together, they had well chemistry in the movie. Will Smith is one of the best actors alive and I wish I can't wait to see his next piece of work.",10,0,1,2 June 2015
Inception," Inception is possible!
","This movie was very powerful! I could not get over of how well I understood the concept of consciousness within a dream and it really made me think about how both the levels of consciousness can at some point become one. Because you can be conscious in your dream surrounded by unconscious or rather subconscious images and buildings around you that you may have seen in reality or at least the reality we're in ha ha. This movie blew my mind on the concept and belief of lucid dreaming I want to see if it is possible for me to be conscious in my own dreams. But its true data with the kick backs as well that the sense of falling can awaken you its happened to me in numerous occasions with dreams I wasn't conscious in or able to control. This movie also explained a lot with the subconscious wanting to attack other conscious people in the dream, because its like a white blood cell and doesn't want to be attacked or uncomfortable in any format of a way. And there are many statements about the ending but I will be honest I think he was awake and back in reality and got to finally see his kids and from how the top was spinning it looked like it was about to stop. Dreams are very powerful and can tell a lot about us and even explain a lot about us. But this movie was a 10 out of 10 for me I love every second of it. I wish there were at least one main black character, but that's fine ha ha. I really would love to see a sequel to this movie or at least another one. Thank you for the best movie I have seen in a while, now if you can excuse me I have to get prepared for the kick start to wake me up!",10,1,4,25 May 2015
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Two thumbs way down
","First, I would like to start off by saying if there was such thing as the worst film award this would win. Honestly, this movie was crappy and kinda dropped my IQ a little bit. I never understood that he was able fly and have telekinetic powers, yet be so concerned about his dreams in being a better screen play writer. That never made any type of sense to me. What were they thinking when they made this movie? To only have good actors, but a crappy story line is never going to go anywhere. I can never understand how this movie could win any awards or even be liked by anyone. This movie was just a film put together with trash and nothing else. I feel you can make better choices with the money and make movies that actually make sense and even have a plot. All in all, I hope this movie never gets mentioned in the universe ever again.",1,11,23,23 February 2015
Wonder Woman," Wonder Cliché
","Just saw Wonder woman and I liked it, but I didn't like it at the same time. The movie was very cliché and predictable for me! I also, didn't like her little super sayian god move when her boyfriend committed suicide. Also, too many slow motion scenes in moments that didn't really need slow motion. Now I did enjoy the acting in the movie and the action that was in the movie with the fight scenes. I loved the voice for wonder woman. In conclusion the movie was good and corny as I don't know what.",5,2,9,6 June 2017
The Emperor's New Groove," Loved being able to see the movie again
",I loved watching this movie again. It was hilarious to watch with more of a cognitive mind. I never realized how well this movie showed that even the angriest and meanest of us humans are not as heartless as we try to be. And it also connects to modern life with how even if we try to be alone we all need at least one person that would never give up on us. Whether it be a friend or a loved one. I enjoyed watching the friendship between Pacha and the Emperor get stronger with trust and dependability. Great job to David Spade and John Goodman they really brought these characters to life in this great movie. I loved this so much. I also loved how the Emperor became a completely different person with a change of character and content.,9,1,2,9 August 2017
The Matrix," Rewatched this movie
",This movie was amazing all props to Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne it was wonderful acting for this movie. I do not believe in fate either. I found it deep that we are born in a bondage and a jail that we cannot fight in this extreme to the movie. In this movie it was clear to tell that Neo and Trinity were going to be come a thing and that Morpheus was going to be a great teacher. This movie definitely brings up very good points. With knowing what is real and what is not real.,9,0,0,9 August 2017
Deadpool," Deadpool!
","I saw Deadpool and I can only way that it was enjoyable. I wouldn't call it amazing. Honestly the movie made me laugh, but I felt like it needed more to it. Dare I say Deadpool actually had a real plot. The movie definitely had me excited once or twice but I personally feel it needed more. The movie trailers definitely ruined a lot of funny parts to the movie but get I've seen worse. I enjoyed seeing colossus in the movie and sonic as well. If I could I would've made Colossus a lot stronger. All in all, it was good, but I feel like the movie needed more. I also wish he had his vanishing move as well that not only would have made the movie more awesome but more accurate as well.",6,1,11,14 March 2016
Kingsman: The Secret Service," First British Movie To Ever Floor Me
","This movie was something that had me at a lost for words. I say that because normally out of country movies or shows bore me to death. But this movie with the action, violence and comedy all in one, definitely changed my perspective and gave me more of an open mind for British movies and shows. I am really glad I watched this movie, Samuel Jackson literally had me laughing the whole time especially with his lisps. This movie also had me entertained with the fight scene when the one man fought about 40 people in the church and had to overcome the battle. I really enjoyed the fight scenes and the plot twists. It definitely took me by shock when certain characters were killed. I loved it definitely a thumbs up from me.",10,3,10,5 April 2015
Minions," Great movie
","This movie was actually very hilarious and I hope to see another if it is made. This movie was a very funny movie that the funny parts never ended. I really appreciated how the intro showed evolution of the minions and basically is how evolution started any way. I was very happy with this movie because in the beginning it showed that the minions killed the dinosaurs and destroyed the pyramids and I could not stop laughing. It was a very awesome prequel and very cool to show how the minions met Gru in the first place. I think the movie would have been even better if it was a sequel to the regular despicable me. I think in total it was hilarious how the minions were so silly and focused on hurting each other with certain situations. In total, it was one of the funniest movies I have seen.",10,5,7,6 August 2015
Incredibles 2," Perfect Movie
","I loved this movie it took 14 years, but it was so worth it. I had a great time watching this movie with the equal balance of feminism, but also, equality between the male and female parents. It was a balanced movie with good comedy and hit me with a surprising twist with who the villain was. This was absolutely beautiful. Showing baby Jack's personality and powers which was way more awesome. It was even better to see the kids save their parents with their powers and skills. I loved this movie and the rush of it.",10,2,5,25 June 2018
The Simpsons Movie," No comment
","When I saw the Simpsons Movie I was really into it and entertained and I thought the movie was hilarious. I enjoyed and loved some of the jokes they had, but as the movie progressed it got offensive by it started bashing God and Jesus and I am a man of faith. I couldn't watch the movie anymore because of the things the movie said. After I still gave it a chance and stayed open minded and tried not to judge it, but the things the movie said made me uncomfortable. So I am writing this review to say that I would've enjoyed it, if only the bashing of not only my families beliefs, but also, other people's beliefs in a higher power wasn't thrown as jokes like that. It's fine to have your own opinions, but don't bash beliefs. That's messed up. All in all, I would never watch the show or movie again.",1,1,4,25 June 2014
Alien: Covenant," Crappy aliens
","Just saw Alien Covenant and I would like to say two thumbs down. The movie was very stupid and way too predictable! This movie needed help. The movie became very boring very fast. The Aliens weren't really in the movie I expected total chaos and action, but it was partially that. If even. I could not connect to this movie in anyway at all. Overall if I had to rate this movie I would give it a 4 out 10.",4,7,15,29 May 2017
V for Vendetta," V For Vendetta Forever!
",This movie was completely awesome. I loved the promotions of bringing the government down for the crimes they have committed. I was very inspired by what he said believe it or not this movie was absolutely hilarious as well. Hearing him talk the way he did had me laughing. Also with the place he lived in with the art and books. The movie was interesting to see with excellent choreography in the fight scenes. I thought it was funny how the woman had to stay at V's home for a year and she was falling in love with him while she had not seen his face. V is an excellent character I loved his personality of being a lone wolf with guts of steel.,10,3,5,9 August 2017
Furious 7," This was good and bad
","First of all, Paul Walker you shall be missed, may you R.I.P. Next is the review. I liked the movie to be honest and I thought it was very enjoyable. It had me laughing from start to finish, but not always in a good way. The movie was presented as epic and thought things would be more epic. There was too much of nothing happening, just explosions in every other scene and a lot of unrealistic non-sense. I don't care who you are, you can't break a cast just by flexing or break the ground by stomping. Another thing is you can't die and come back to life because of someone speaking to you and telling you they love you. And yes as nit picky as that sounds its true. All in all, this movie could have been a lot better and a lot more entertaining without all the extra take up space. I enjoyed the words of good bye to Paul Walker though it really was a tear jerker. I really enjoyed the series, thanks.",5,4,21,5 April 2015
