Sucker Punch," This movie is not for stupid people!
","To all who say that this has a terrible, if not nonexistent, storyline, they are WRONG! This movie has a very clever storyline that exceeds much of the Hollywood junk we get today.Yes, the emphasis of the film is that hardcore fantasy scenes from Snyder's own imagination, but it does relate to what's happening outside the character's imagination. She's in a mental asylum, so don't be surprised of what she imagines of.Another VERY ANNOYING thing from other reviews are that they DO NOT understand the story. Not to give spoilers, but I think the story is somewhat like Shutter Island combined with Inception (not the horror or action elements, but the psychological element).The ending may be hard to grasp for viewers. You have to be intelligent to understand it. From the previous review, the reviewer questioned why it goes from 'being a prisoner to being a burlesque dancer'. He obviously did not understand the symbolic element of the storyline.I have to admit, there was not enough action to make up for the plot development. Don't listen to people who say the movie is pure eye candy; it's actually a well designed maze of twists and turns.On the action side, IT WAS AMAZING! This movie has by far the best made CGI action sequences I have ever seen. Well timed slow motion shots, excellent angles and perspectives, and slick moves. If you thought 300 had well choreographed fighting, you have to see this.I strongly recommend this movie. But don't go and only expect hardcore action with a stupid plot. Open up your mind like you did when you watch inception, because this movie is all about the story.",10,6,13,29 March 2011
