Skyfall," 2nd Best Bond Movie Ever!
","This is my second favorite Bond movie. I go back and forth with this and Casino Royale for the #1 spot, and even despite Javier Bardem's Joker-esque villain being the best Bond villain of all time, Royale still edges out the win, but just barely. This is the Bond series equivalent of The Dark Knight. Bond and Silva go back and forth like Batman and the Joker. The story delves the deepest into Bond's psyche that we have ever seen. Bond is in the worst shape he's ever been in and is still pushing himself. And I actually prefer his absence of a love interest. M finally dies (I can't stand her character)! The visuals beautiful as always. Craig gave it his ALL in this film. Sadly, I don't think we'll ever see another Bond film of this caliber again from Craig considering Spectre and his lack of desire (I believe he said that he'd rather 'slash his wrsits') to continue playing this character. We'll have to wait for Bond 25 to find out.",9,3,6,30 April 2019
Avengers: Endgame," It all begins and ends with Iron Man.
","A MUST see in order to find out how the story that began 11 years ago finally ends.What I DIDN'T like:
1. Hulk not fighting for the second Avengers movie in a row. I thought for sure has was getting a rematch with Thanos, especially when he put on the infinity gauntlet (I thought the gamma radiation might amplify his power and turn him into super Hulk). Smart Hulk is boring.
2. Thor becoming a fat drunk. It totally detracts from his badass character and is insulting to his fans.
3. Captain Marvel (or her dumb haircut) only helping out for 5 seconds during the final battle... You know, since she's supposed to be the most powerful.
4. Too many characters sharing screen time during the final battle. Most only got about 10 seconds.What I DID like:
1. Iron Man going out in a blaze of glory with the same words that started it all.. 'I am Iron Man'.
2. Cap finally making a decision that didn't involve sacrifice by going back and living the life he missed out on.
3. Hawkeye going full 'Dark Passenger'.
4. Everything else.I remember reading these comic books as a teenager. Seeing all these characters (Iron Man in particular was always my favorite) come to life on the big screen has been some of the most exciting movie experiences of my life.",9,2,3,29 April 2019
Quantum of Solace," Seriously Underrated!
","I don't understand what everyone's beef is with this movie?? They say that it's the worst of the Daniel Craig entries. I disagree... I would say Spectre is. Solace is action packed from start to finish. Car chases, boat chases, plane battles, surprise knife fights, shootouts, explosions... What else do you want from a Bond movie!? My favorite part though is that Bond is in pissed off no bullshit mode the whole time. He doesn't give a F about checking in with M (The most annoying character in the series). The visuals are beautiful. The one thing that I didn't like was the villain, Greene. At no time did he pose a real threat to Bond. Even their 'end fight' was laughable (as they were fighting I actually thought, 'this is the guy they want me to think is going to take Bond out...'?). Then again, maybe that's why Bond didn't actually kill him and let him die on his own in the desert. Other than that, I would say this a must see for any Bond fan. I think Quantum got overshadowed by The Dark Knight and Iron Man that year. In the annals of Bond movie history Solace is still in the top 5 at the end of the day.",8,4,8,3 May 2019
The Dark Knight," The GREATEST Movie Of All Time!
","Where to begin... This is not only the greatest comic book movie ever, but also the greatest MOVIE ever! It is the only movie that I can legitimately give a 10 star rating to and use as a point of reference to rate all other movies by. I was skeptical when Heath Ledger was cast as the Joker because Nicholson was so great, but Ledger took it to the next level and his portrayal of the character made this movie what it is. Right from the start we see that Ledger's Joker is a 'psychopath with an agenda' (a far departure from Nicholson's more clownish portrayal). I have never seen an actor so fully embody a character to the extent that Heath did. Ledger actually became the Joker so much so that Heath just disappears. Bale (the best Batman to date 2019) gives another great stoic performance as the caped crusader and is pushed to the limit mentally by the Joker as to how far he is willing to go in his quest to fight crime. The scene where Batman (in the Batmobile/on the Bat-pod) and the Joker (in the semi truck) duel is hands down my favorite movie scene of all time. The Joker is ready to let Batman kill him in order to get Bats to break his 'one rule' and prove his point. Nolan uses this 'argument' that the Batman and Joker are having to create a masterpiece on social commentary that is more of an action packed psychological thriller than a comic book adaptation. He also cleverly uses the character arc of Harvey Dent to show how life tragedies affect the 3 main characters (the psychological complexity of which is way too deep to delve into in a review but genius). Dent, an outwardly moral man, after losing Rachel fulfills his own prophesy, 'You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain', thus becoming Two Face. The Joker has already let tragedies turn him into what he has become, a man with no rules, who needs Harvey to fall in order to prove that 'one bad day' can turn anyone into a monster. And finally Batman, who despite losing Rachel (on top of his parents deaths) and breaking his one rule by killing Dent in order to save Gordon and his family, remains good and takes the blame for Harvey's crimes in order for Gotham to maintain hope in what is the most EPIC movie ending of all time. He rides off as the secret hero. A true 'Dark Knight'! There are other important aspects of social commentary that Nolan touches on, but I'm not going to get into all those. The movie also sports an all-star secondary cast: Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and Eric Roberts (to name a few) who are stars in their own right. The soundtrack won awards. The only thing I didn't like about the movie is that after you see it you know that you have seen the greatest movie you ever will in your lifetime.",10,1,1,3 May 2019
Casino Royale," BEST Bond Movie Ever!
","I didn't even like James Bond movies before this one as Pierce Brosnan was the only Bond I knew, so don't hold it against me. Daniel Craig nails his Bond debut and breathes life back into the series. This 007 movie gets everything right. Craig's take on the character is gritty yet vulnerable. The parkour fight sequence at the beginning is insane! Mads Mikkelsen (now known as Hannibal) is spectacular as the villain. And who will ever forget the infamous 'ball whipping' torture scene (I cringe just thinking about it)?! Eva Green's Vesper is also the best Bond girl ever and gives heart to his character. Beautiful visuals and story-telling. Anytime I question who the best Bond is I re-visit this flick and am reminded... Daniel Craig is.PS - And YES I did go back and watch every Bond movie ever made and Craig is still the best, period.",9,2,5,29 April 2019
Spectre," Enjoyable, but my least favorite Craig installment.
","I really did enjoy this movie... BUT, I can tell that Craig is tired of playing Bond and is just phoning it in at this point. I also had really high hopes for Waltz as the villain, but somehow he managed to be a huge letdown, which made the entire ending sequence seem generic and anticlimactic. Other than that there were some great action scenes. Most notably, the epic fight with Bautista, which is the best train fight in movie history. The opening scene with the building collapsing and the plane takeover was pretty intense too. His romance with Swann isn't exactly say, 'Vesper quality', but despite her being half his age it is somewhat believable. The visuals are beautiful as always. You definitely have to see it if you're a Bond fan. I just hope that Craig has one round left in the chamber for Bond 25 if it is his final outing before hanging up his PPK, because we KNOW he has more in him than this.",7,0,3,26 April 2019
