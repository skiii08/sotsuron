The New World," Slow visuals
","I don't think this movie deserves an eight, it deserves more of a three. The director really does capture a whole lot of nature scenes, with music. The only thing i didn't like about the movie was that it was very slow (almost three hours) and the whispering monologue. The only thing i I enjoyed were some of the nature scenes. If you want something that will help you fall asleep, this is the movie for you.",2,1,2,6 September 2018
The Alamo," The Alamoo
","The Alamo is about Mexicans and Americans fighting for Texas. Texas wanted independence from Mexico, which lead to the battle called The Alamo. Because the movie was made in 2004 the special effects were not so great but not too bad either. The acting was pretty good, and the battle scenes were good. I'd say this movie was historically accurate.",3,1,5,17 October 2018
