National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Few friends, couple of road blocks, for which they overcome
","National treasure 2 went exactly how I though it would. I walked in, sat down, witnessed a very similar plot to the first movie. To summarize it was a few friends, they came across a couple of road blocks, a couple of bad guys, but they got the treasure. The end. simple, elegant, genius. 9/10, I would give it ten, but it could have had a few more road blocks. Nicholas cage never had a torch like in the movie poster, only a flare, disappointing, 7/10. The best part of the movie was when Nick cage had a flare, and when there was a lot of water coming out of the things in the pyramid, and Nick's nemesis nearly died, but then they didn't die because they were enemies, to me this seems unrealistic, as if I were in the pyramid I would make them go down with me. 5/10. I really enjoyed Nick Cage. My favorite character was the comical guy who had the book and he had the book and no one came to his book signing because they never came because he is pathetic in real life. But he had a book. 1/10.Regards,Class 3C, St. Snell Prep. School.",9,0,2,29 March 2008
