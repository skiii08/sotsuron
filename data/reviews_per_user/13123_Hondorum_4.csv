Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Have not seen A better movie than this!
","Taking place before the original trilogy, this movie, in my opinion, is as good or even better than the originals. Many people say that this installment is not as good as the other, but you must remember that the movie was created in a different time period, and also, the main character is a 9-year-old. Otherwise, the film is great. Before you see this film, I think you should see the original trilogy first. It gives you more understanding of the movie.  Star Wars: The Phantom Menace is my favorite movie. I have seen it so many times, that I have memorized all of the lines. I think everybody should see this movie. Thank you George.",10,1,2,4 July 2002
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Well-made.. Worth seeing more than once.
","Pirates of the Caribbean is a well-made movie and is worth taking the time to see. Its excellent story and wonderful selection of actors and actresses has drawn in many people of all ages. What makes this movie so good is it's never ceasing action, which was brilliantly choreographed. Its musical score is quite good also. It might just seem that is the best movie ever made, or that it can be shown anywhere to anyone. But it is obviously not the greatest movie, nor can it be shown to whoever wants to watch it. Let me remind you that this movie is PG-13. This is because of its crude humor and intense fight scenes. This is why only people that are teens or older should watch it, hence PG-13. Other than that it is an excellent movie which deserves being watched more than once.",7,0,1,1 September 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," It is a book that has become a movie that will stand for generation as one of the greatest stories of ALL TIME.
","Leaving you off at the end of the Fellowship of the Ring, it continues will no background of what had happened already. It makes the movie flow better. It also gives you A reason to see the first installment. Out of all the trilogies I have seen, never have I seen the second installment better than the first one. It captures the immense detail of the book. That is why it is so grand. Tolkien's story was put together so that if it is changed, it losses its meaning. The cast and crew realized that, causing then to put in the most minute details. Of course, some things had to be changed. There are some things in books that don't work for movies. The most major mistake, that I find, is the Fact that the movie does not end when then book ends. The line in the book is, 'Frodo was alive but taken by the Enemy.' In the movie, it only foreshadows that specific line with the line, 'she will do it.' But, I understand that in movies, time is limited; and time was sparse at the time. If the movie continued, it would cause the audience to become bored. Other than that, no movie has surpassed it- for me anyway. I also find that there are hidden truths behind Lord of the Rings. I find it through my studies of Tolkien. That is what made it special; that is what made it never to be surpassed by any other book. It is a book that has become a movie that will stand for generation as one of the greatest stories of ALL TIME.",10,1,1,23 January 2003
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," 'A Long Time Ago in A Galaxy Far, Far Away...'
",Star Wars. One of the Top movies of all time. I haven't seen A better movie than this. This low budget film has changed movie making and captured the hearts of millions of fans around the World. Everyone should see this film. Few people that I have seen hate Star Wars. Star Wars never  gets old. There is something new every time you see it. It is the Best film I have EVER seen..,10,0,0,2 July 2002
