Alien 3," Underrated
","This was a very underrated movie.
A well acted movie. Acting was better than Aliens which was more video game than movie. Way better than Resurrection which was a mess.
It reminded me of the original Alien a dark slow burn horror movie.",7,3,5,28 February 2018
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," 20 Years have passed since this disaster was released
","I'm watching this again, for the 100th time, on TNT
I can't get over how bad the acting was and the dialogue was so stiff and awkward especially young Anikan. Jake Lloyd was painfully bad. I'm still waiting for Natalie Portman to put in a good performance. Watto, the blatant anti semitism was cringe worthy and the epic failure of Jar Jar Binks. Even Ewan McGregor amd Liam Neeson couldn't save this mess.
As bad as this is i will watch it again.
May the force be with The Rise of Skywalker",4,3,7,21 December 2019
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Elvis Costello & The Attractions - Accidents Will Happen
","I always wondered what was that song Michael was singing when he came home from school and first saw E.T.?'There's so many people to see
So many people you can check up on
And add to your collection'I wished i lived in that neighborhood riding my Mongoose BMX, So cool.
A timeless classic with a great story great acting and a great soundtrack.
Is that Ponyboy from Outsiders? Erika Eleniak from Baywatch?",10,6,7,22 October 2019
A Star Is Born," Alcoholics are...
","Narcissistic, self involved, self absorbed, needy, and very very boring!
I this, me that, i want, i need, i, i ,i , i ,me, me, me ,me.
Just couldn't connect with Bradley Cooper. I felt zero empathy for him.
That was a big problem i had with this movie. Plus he mumbled through the whole movie. Speak up!
Lady Gaga's performance was goodgood but wasn't quit sure what moved her, what was holding her back.
Don't try to save a person drowning in alcohol because they will take you to the bottom with them.
The movie was just too slow for my taste.",5,2,2,9 June 2019
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Even Angrier About the Prequels!
","Bloated CGI, terrible acting and painful dialogue.Now Rogue One was excellent. Great characters, acting was top notch and the CGI was seamless.As i watched this i kept cursing young Anakin, Padme and the evil Jar Jar Binks. This is what the prequels should have been!The ending caught me off guard Wait no! People compare Rogue One to a war movie. I see it. Reminded me of Saving Private RyanI look forward to the Han Solo project.'The force is with me and i am one with the force'One more thing IMDb what's with the minimum length for reviews is 10 lines of text. Less is more come on guys!",9,0,5,21 December 2016
Passengers," Coolant Leak!!
",'Coolant leak i have to dump the core!' 'System malfunctioning i have to override manually!' Does the warp core ejection system ever work? Who designs these ships? Visually some scenes were good.The part where Jennifer was swimming and the gravity shut off was cool. Nothing wrong with seeing Jennifer in a bathing suit. Outside of that nothing special about this movie. Didn't buy the 'Stockholm Syndrome'story. Found it a bit creepy.,5,1,2,12 November 2017
Ready Player One," Ready Player NOT!
","Oh man no!
Having read the book twice, which was excellent, i was really looking forward to this. What a disappointment. First off the acting and dialogue were terrible, at times cringe worthy. Absolutely no chemistry between Parzival, Artemis, and Aech. In the book they would sit around in an OASIS room chatting and busting each others chops. That was missing in the movie. No time to get to know the characters. Plus Halliday looked and talked like Garth from Wayne's World. 'Party on Parzival'.
The scenes in the OASIS were visually cool but again bad dialogue and at times difficult to follow.
Too bad.
I highly recommend reading the book, twice.",4,1,2,14 November 2018
Molly's Game," Runner Runner
","Jessica Chastain and Idris Elba make this movie.
Well acted, good pacing, plus degenerate gamblers make a good story.
Add to that this was a true story. Leonardo DiCaprio, Macaulay Culkin, Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Alex Rodriguez, Nelly, were the actual players in her games.",7,2,3,25 March 2019
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," A Dark and Strange Movie.
","A well acted movie but not quit sure what to make of it. 
Halfway through it real turned dark. Suicide, molotov cocktails, arson, and throwing people out of windows.
Frances Mcdormand was great but her character went off the rails. You betcha.
Sam Rockwell also great but his character as well was difficult to understand. Some of his actions made no sense. You don't throw a person out of a second story window and punch a woman in the face without repercussion..
A good slow burn movie. 'Burn' maybe i should have used a different word. Oh yah? Yah.",6,0,0,5 August 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," Nothing Original
","Humble beginnings. Struggle to make an album. Band in fighting. My song is better than yours. Record company resists the songs. Stardum hits.Then comes the drugs and alcohol. I've heard this song before.
I kept waiting for the Wayne and Garth cameo.
Nothing really original to me.",6,3,8,7 July 2019
Bird Box," Who are the Creatures?
","What/Who are these creatures?
Agents of chaos and insanity?
Driven by a desire to destroy all forms of structure and plunge mankind into utter anarchy.
Where did they come from? A singularity?
What caused the madness? Looking into infinity?
Just one look was all it took; before one word was spoken the human mind was broken.I think the 'creatures' were black holes, singularities the size of a pin prick that were triggered by light frequencies. They would blink in and out of our realm like a firefly and once humans looked into them drove them insane.
No? Well you explain them. Josh Malerman didn't explain them.The first place i would run to is a school for the blind.",6,54,131,21 December 2018
Baby Driver," 'Ladies and gentlemen, rock and roll'
","The first words spoken on MTV!
I was waiting for a cameo by Nina Blackwood.
At times this felt like an 80s video.
I get a Rainman feel off of Baby. Instead of cards and toothpicks his special skills are driving and making music.
A lot of style. A lot of coolness. A lot of excentricities.
Not a bad movie. Kevin Spacey has played this role many times.",6,0,2,30 June 2019
Yesterday," The novelty wore off quickly
","And then i was left with the struggle to finish the movie.
The songs were cool. As i was watching i was googling the songs to see which Beatle wrote it and what was the inspiration.
The movie turned into a long and winding road.",5,1,2,8 March 2020
Bridesmaids," It's Coming Out Of Me Like Lava!
","The scene in the bathroom was the only time i laughed.
This was NOT a funny movie. Kirsten Wiig was not funny but annoying. She is not a good actress plus her nose job is distracting. The Hangover now that was funny.",3,0,3,15 December 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Censorship
","Why did IMDB delete my original review?
I didn't not use profanity at all. It was actually very funny.Freedom of speech is a principle that supports the freedom of an individual the right to express any opinions without censorship or restraint.",6,2,9,5 May 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," The Force did not guide The Last Jedi
","Rey talking to Luke'Now will you help us? You have to help us. We need the Jedi Order back. We need Luke Skywalker.'Luke's eyes were cold and flinty.
'No''What?''You don't need Luke Skywalker''Did you hear a word i just said? We really, really do'Wowza. This is dialogue?Opening scene to Empire Strikes Back.Luke: Echo Three to Echo Seven. Han, old buddy, do you read me?Han : Loud and clear, kid. What's up?Luke: Well, I finished my circle. I don't pick up any life readings.Han : There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. Sensors are placed. I'm going back.You could hear, feel, see the chemistry the force between Han and Luke.
That's what was lacking in The Last Jedi.Finn: 'You know this town, Canto Bight?'Rose: 'From the stories' she said 'It's a terrible place filled with the vilest people in the galaxy'Star Wars: New Hope
Obi-Wan Kenobi: Mos Eisley spaceport 'You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. We must be cautious'You see the difference?
I blame Rian Johnson who wrote the screen play.So the plot.Down to its last fuel reserve.When the medical frigate's fuel was gone, it would lose headway.Thirty percent of the deep fuel reservoir remains to be siphoned.We have just enough fuel for one jump.The smaller ships will run out of fuel first.Their medical frigate is out of fuel and falling behind.So the resistance is looking for an inter galactic Exxon/Mobile gas station. Maybe they can pick up couple blasters and a four pack of Red Bull. That was the plot. Oh and Luke was training Rey in jiu jitsu or something like that and Rey and Kylo skyping over intergalactic broadband.
Bad acting, bad dialogue, and a laughable embarrassing ending.The force was weak with this one. I added a star or two for the nostalgia.",3,8,14,4 November 2018
From Dusk Till Dawn," Salma Hayek rolling her hips
","Dear God!
Outside of that not quite sure what to make of this movie.
Harmless Saturday night popcorn movie with Salma Hayek dancing in a bikini.
Dear God!",5,0,0,28 June 2020
Joker," And I feel like I'm slowly, slowly, slowly slipping under
","Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you againThis was a journey into the land of insanity
I really enjoyed Joker's stroll into the realm of psychosis.Sanity is such a delicate, tentative, state of being, the Joker would know.
The problem with insanity is how incredibly sane it feels.",7,2,2,17 May 2020
The Reader," You don't have the power to upset me.
","You don't matter enough to upset me.Bruises fade and go away. Broken bones will heal. But hateful words can stay in a person's heart and mind forever.The 36-year-old Hanna seduces 15-year-old Michael, and they begin an affair.A well done slow burn movie.",7,0,1,19 January 2019
The Wrestler," Great Performance by Mickey Rourke
","An aging professional wrestler who, despite his failing health and waning fame, continues to wrestle in an attempt to cling to the success of his heyday.Great acting with a great script.
The sadness and loneliness was always hanging around like a dark cloud.Re watched this in honor of 'Mean' Gene Okerlund.
Rest in peace.'You know something Mean Gene it's the dream of a lifetime its like going to the mountain top a thousand times over. Hulkamania is running wild!'",8,0,0,3 January 2019
Kong: Skull Island," Is That A Monkey? HA!
","For the most part a fun popcorn movie. John C Reilly's character was cool but Samuel Jackson's was dark and disturbing. Not sure what motivated him to kill Kong. Margo Robbie would have made a better girlfriend for Kong. I was rooting for Kong to kill all the dumb humans. Why is it we shoot first and ask questions later?Samuel Jackson's story of Icarus was not exactly true. Icarus' father warns him first of complacency and then of hubris, asking that he fly neither too low nor too high. Looks like mans hubris cost them many lives.",6,0,1,25 November 2017
Wonder Woman," More Casablanca less CGI
","A fun and a times dark movie, a little uneven and too long.
Chris Pine is a very good actor. Good chemistry with Gal Gadot also a good actress.
I wanted a Wonder Woman who was more Ingrid Bergman in Casablanca and less Carrie-Anne Moss in Matrix slow motion action.
All in all a good super hero movie that looks like it will have a long franchise.",7,0,3,12 February 2018
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Mos Eisley Spaceport
","Ben Obi-Wan Kenobi: Mos Eisley spaceport: You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. We must be cautious.Han Solo: Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.The original trilogy had the perfect mix between humor, drama, action and suspense. And they have never been able to capture it again.This is what was missing from the prequels and the sequels. The clever, sharp, witty dialogue. The Force Awakens was good but the other two were a waste of time. Lets not get into how bad the prequels were.",10,1,1,12 January 2020
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Elsa. What a beauty
","'Archeology is the search for fact, not truth.'Better than the original? With the addition of Sean Connery i say yes30 years and still better than the junk they put out these days. See Star Wars The Last Jedi.'It belongs in a museum.'
'So do you.'",10,0,0,23 December 2019
Alien: Covenant," War of the Worlds
","Martians lack of knowledge or preparation against any bacteria indigenous to Earth, causes their destruction.
So what do these dumb human scientist do? Explore a unknown planet and get infected by a pathogen indigenous to the planet.
Humans are dumb!
The acting was second rate and the actors were forgettable. 
More time should have been spent exploring what happened to Prometheus and who the Creators were.
Wasted opportunity.",3,1,1,4 March 2018
