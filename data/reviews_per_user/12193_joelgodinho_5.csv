Spartacus," I'm Spartacus!
","Spartacus is a 1960 film directed by Stanley Kubrick and starring Kirk Douglas, Jean Simmons and Tony Curtis.
I must admit that I haven't really seen many Kubrick films so far, this is only the 3rd one, however I will say that all of them have been really good experiences.
The film has some great acting by all of the cast and the story is very interesting with a strong ending, also the battle sequence is great and the following 'I'm Spartacus' scene is very emotional and one of the most iconic moments in film.
That being said I think that this film has sadly been a little overlooked or forgotten maybe because it's less memourable then other Kubrick's works like A Clockwork Orange, 2001, The Shining or Dr Strangelove or maybe because it stays under the shadow of Ben Hur who came out the year before.

The Big Lebowski," Good but a bit overated
","The Coen brothers are two of the best filmmakers of the decade and one of their most popular movie is The Big Lebowski, and it's easy to see why, the film is absolutely hilarious I espeacily love the constant beatings that the Dude's car takes, the acting is on point with Jeff Bridges and John Goodman obviously standing out and the mistery and thriller part of the movie is actually pretty interesting too in my opinion. However I don't think the movie is perfect, I don't really get or find funny the dream sequences and overall I don't feel the movie is very memourable and doesn't stand out much for me. But that's just, like, my opinion man. 7.4/10",7,1,2,6 May 2020
The Longest Day," An Epic D-day Movie
","The Longest Day is a 1962 war movie with one of the most impressive cast in film history (Robert Mitchum, Henry Fonda, John Wayne). Coming at about 3 hours this film is very long and with a gigantic number of characters. I really liked this film, it's portrait of the many forces that played an important role in the D day and the all together epic proportions of this film. I also really liked the cinematography, the beach landings have some amazing and beautiful shots. The acting is good but maybe due to the giant amount of characters it feels like no one (not even the big names) gives any amazing performance. I personaly think the film is a little too long but it wasn't painful to sit trough it. Finaly I absolutely loved how the film showed so many perspesctives, the american and british forces, the french forces returning to fight for their country, the german point of view and I espeacily loved the scenes with the french resistance. There were parts of the movie that really put me off though, like in the beginning the shot of a german talking with the sea behind him but then he sudently disapears and reapears back in the same place a few moments later.
Overall this film isn't perfect or anything but it is still very worth watching and it's still probably one of the best D day movie ever made

The Untouchables," Classic Gangster Film
","The Untouchables is a 1987 Brian De Palma film starring Kevin Costner, Sean Connery and Robert De Niro. I like this film, the acting is pretty good by most characters particularly the villains in my opinion; the story is really good and there are some amazing scenes in the film, the best in my opinion being that incredible part in the train station with the baby carriage but the ending is also really good. The soundtrack is really good as well in fact one of my favourites of all time.
Overall this is just a classic gangster film and while it's definitely not one of the greatest film of all time it's still very good and really entertaining

The Social Network," One of the best of it's decade
","The Social Network is an amazing 2010 film directed by David Fincher and starring Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake among others. I never really got interested in checking out this film maybe because out of all social networks Facebook is the one I use the least or maybe because I wasn't interested in the story of it's creation however I ended up watching it's amazing trailer and finaly decided to check it out and I am really happy I did because this film is truelly incredible. First of all even though this film is about the creation of Facebook I don't think it depends on it's existence or popularity and in fact I'd even argue it will be meaningfull and remebered for more time then Facebook itself. The acting in the film is all great and I really like the fact that it's great despite the fact that half the characters aren't very likeable. The cinematography is really good with the movie being visualy beautiful but what in my opinion is the best part of the movie is simply the story, I adore it, it's very interesting and I also liked how it's presented with flashbacks, the ending is also one of my favourites of all time.
Also the movie's score is really good and even feels scary or disturbing at times wich I'm not sure if it was intended or not but nontheless I really like it.
Anyways, it's just a fantastic film and one of the best of the decade and even of the last 20 years and it's obviously worth watching it.
