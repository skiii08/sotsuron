Joker," Indeed a masterpiece
","Heath ledger's performance as the joker will be the best interpretation of the joker by any actor!
Joaquin Phoenix was close second !
His performance was overwhelming outstanding and his portrayal was more of how the joker was born and legers was more of the joker showing how diverse and disturbing he is however that blood at the end is very iconic.
Joaquin You do deserve Osacar for these great performance. üëèüëè",10,1,1,6 October 2019
