Hereditary," Holy Crap!!! What is Aster's deal?!?
","Ok,,, this is the 2nd movie I've seen from this director,,, there will not be a 3rd!!!!!!!!!!! I thought Midsommar was crazy,,, but this,,,,Now,, that being said,, there was SO much about the movie that I liked,,, as in the acting, the music, the scenery,,, incredible. Collette, Bryn, and the actor and actress who played the kids were incredible.Now,, back to the horror,,, i had heard that many people couldn't finish watching bc it was just too much. Well,, I took that as a challenge,, and boy what a challenge it is. This was actually my 2nd attempt. The first time I didn't get 10 mins in (wasn't in the mood). This movie was such emotional agony at times,,, then,, the ending really throws you for a loop,, bc you will not see it coming.For anyone who wants to bravely/foolishly watch this,, make sure you have something really funny and lighthearted to watch immediately after,, trust me,,, but,,,DON'T WATCH IT IF YOU'RE FAINT OF HEART!!!",6,0,1,4 May 2020
Fury," Incredible
","Took 5 yrs for me to see this, but WoW!!!! Incredible performances all around!! Pitt delivered one of his best performances as the war-torn leader. Pena continues to show his range as an actor. I am not a LaBeouf fan at all,, but he was awesome in this movie. Bernthal,,, well he never ceases to amaze us with how good he is. Lerman comes into the story green as can be, and transforms into a warrior over the course of the movie.",8,1,2,8 January 2020
As Good as It Gets," Now I see why it got all those Oscars,,,
","It only took 23 yrs for me to finally sit down and watch this from beginning to end,,, and it's some of the best performances in cinema.Just watch the movie,, you'll see :)",8,0,0,7 June 2020
The Maze Runner," I enjoyed the trilogy (not incredible, but good)
","While this will never rank up there with LOTR, Star Wars, or anything like that,,, these movies were well worth watching (great showcase of young, new acting talent).So go watch it!!",6,0,1,17 May 2020
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Captain! Jack, Sparrow,,,,
","What can I say about this one. Saw it back when it came out,, both then and now it's one of my favorite trilogies (only counting the first 3,,, not including Stranger Tides,, didn't see the 5th). So,, unless you don't like movies,, or anything fun,,, go watch it!!",8,0,1,23 April 2020
Knives Out," Not near what I expected it to be,, but worth a watch
","From seeing the trailer, I expected this to be at least an 8 star quality movie. The cast, the cast!! A few newcomers (that are becoming very popular) and a lot of big stars (Evans, Curtis, Plummer, Shannon, Craig). However,, the movie wasn't nearly as good as the trailer made it look. It's certainly not bad,, but an 8 star it is nowhere near. It actually takes a lil while to pickup and get going,,, so yeah, it's a 6 star. No more, no less,,,",6,2,3,21 June 2020
Terminator Salvation," This is right along the lines of what I wanted to see,,,
","I'll never for the life of me understand why this movie didn't do well at the box office.
I give it at least a 7.8 rating, at least. If not an 8. Was the movie without flaws,, well no. How many movies are without flaws? Not many. There were several spots I thought could've been done a lil better. A few scenes kind of transitioned weirdly,, and when Marcus came out of the pit, covered in mud and yelled up to the sky,,, that was kind of laughable,,, but It's forgivable (after all,, I'm not a filmmaker).
Other than that,,, I don't get what the problem was.After the ending of T3,, this setting is pretty much where I saw the story going. I was overjoyed to hear that Christian Bale was taking on the role of John Connor (this was after Batman Begins, and TDK). I think he brought a great amount of energy and intensity to the role. I liked Howard getting cast as his wife. She's always great. Most of the remaining cast was fairly unknown to me. I didn't know what to think of Sam Worthington playing a Cyborg/Terminator who thinks he's human,, however after seeing it in the theater, and now again (11 yrs later),, I think his character brought a lot to the story. (Spoiler alert!!) He has no clue that he's part machine until he's involved in an explosion, and loses some skin. Even when John Connor is interrogating him, Marcus swears he has no clue of how he got this way (and he's telling the truth! He was killed by lethal injection in 2003,, then he wakes up in 2018,, that's enough to make anyone lose their minds). Anyways,,,Without giving everything away,, I'll say a lil of what I thought was great about the moive -THE SETTING - the atmosphere is very dystopian like.TERMINATORS - I liked the fact that we see lots of Terminators (several different kinds) and there's no guessing what they are. Close to the end, we do see the T-800 in Arnold covering,, but until then the Terminators are all metal.The Resistance - John Connor is part of the Resistance,, but he's not in charge of it all. He has a command of a unit of troops,, and when he's not out fighting he reviews tapes his mother made for him.Like I've said,, this movie is what I wanted to see. I wish they had made at least 1 more following this one (of course,, 2 would've been preferable) with Bale as Connor. I think McG did a great job,,, too bad others didn't.If you're going to watch this one,, I suggest you watch Terminators 1, 2, and 3 before this. I think Terminator Salvation follows those 3 perfectly. Do not bother viewing Genisys or Dark Fate at the same time (not that they are bad,, they just don't belong with these other movies,,, at least not i the order I just said. If you're going to watch Dark Fate,, then view T1, T2,, then Dark Fate).Anyways,,, give this movie a chance,,, it really has gotten a bum rap.",8,0,0,5 July 2020
Aquaman," I AM AQUAMAN
","Who knew Aquaman could be so cool?!?James Wan really brought it with this one. All around great movie. The characters, the visual imagery,, all outstanding.Momoa is the Aquaman we deserve!! Never did I imagine a world like we see in this movie. (Atlantis!!!) I read some review that talked about Momoa acting like a tattooed, bullish thug as the character in this movie. Not sure what that viewer was expecting to see,, but the last thing I saw was a thug. Momoa plays the character of Arthur Curry perfectly,, and yes, he's a bit rough around the edges,, but he's a hero of the land and sea!! The rest of the cast was great as well,, including Heard. Wilson, Lundgren, and Kidman (also Pops Curry, and the guy who played Black Manta).So, the main movie starts after the events of Justice League. Arthur Curry is doing what he has been for awhile, protecting the sea. Otb, the redheaded Atlantian Mera shows up and tells Arthur that his half-brother Orn is bringing a war to the surface/land,, and he must challenge Orn for the throne of Atlantis! From there,, action ensues!!The one complaint,, or more of an observation/question, I have is what the heck is up with the music being played in that scene where Black Manta was putting his suit together? The scene was fine,, but where'd that music come from?!? Just didn't fit imo.Anyways,, If you want to to see a fun movie, then this'll fit the bill.So go watch it!!!",8,0,4,27 June 2020
Cloverfield," Yipe!
","As far as found footage and creature features go,, this one ranks right up there with the best! It also doesn't hurt having those 3 female leads.So,, a big party is being thrown at an apartment in New York. In the midst of the celebration the entire building shakes,, and explosions start happening with debris flying everywhere! What could it be? A MONSTER!!!Go watch it already!",7,0,0,30 June 2020
Suicide Squad," Fun time with plenty of lols
","I honestly do not understand why this movie got all the bad reviews. Can't understand for the life of me. I guess some people want the DCEU to be more like the MCU? To that I ask,, why?!? I would prefer a difference.Now,, do I have a few complaints about this movie,, well yeah. I do have a few,, but I'll get to that later.This movie introduces us to a lot of characters we haven't seen on the big screen - Deadshot, Harley Quinn, Killer Croc, Diablo, Capt Boomerang, Katana, and the Enchantress. (If any of those characters have been in a live action movie it's news to me) Will Smith kills it as Deadshot (pun intended). I hope he comes back for the 3rd movie. Margot Robbie was obviously born to play the role of Harley Quinn. She just becomes the character. Kinnaman was great as Rick Flagg, and all the other characters were played good as well.
Davis as Amanda Waller,,, holy crap!!! (No surprise though,, she is an Oscar winning actress) Like Deadshot says in the movie,, she is just a mean, mean lady. Cold as they come!!
Of courrse,, can't leave out Affleck as Batman. He makes a few short appearances. (I was among the group of people who were displeased upon hearing he was cast as Batman in BvS:Dawn of Justice. I did, however, trust Snyder, having seen all of his previous work,, and I was incredibly pleased with Afflecks performance as the Caped Crusader. As a matter of fact,, imo he is the #2 performance of the character(Bale and Keaton are tied for the #1 spot).) Also,, Leto!!! I realize I'm in the minority here,, but I enjoyed Leto's portrayal of Joker,,, and I wanted MORE!!!!!!!!!!
For those who expected more of Ledger's portrayal,, what were you thinking?!? Different universe!!! Also,, why would you want the same thing again?!? Leto did a great job of being over the top weird and crazy! I want to see him again,,,Now onto the complaints,, well, like I said, I wanted more of the Joker. Other than that,, there was one scene towards the end where things are going in slow motion. I like that things are building up to a climax in slow motion,,, it was just a little too slow. Needed to be going a lil bit faster than it was. It's forgivable,, but it still irks me every time I watch the movie.And that's pretty much it.So go watch it!!!!",7,0,0,26 June 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Balanced
","Just saw it. While I'm certain there are going to be a lot of angry people griping about how they didn't do this or that,,, let's celebrate what they did do. They gave us an excellent ending to the Skywalker saga. No,, you're not going to get an answer to EVERYTHING. If that bothers you,,, go cry about it ya bunch a babies!!
I did not see a lot of what occurs in this film coming,, so, GO SEE IT!!!",9,1,2,20 December 2019

Bird Box," Well that was interesting
","I liked it,,,Although it certainly has it's flaws,, it's an enjoyable suspense/horror/thriller with a great cast.Watch it if you're not squeamish",6,2,3,6 June 2020
Justice League," Unite the League!!!
","Now,, before I start, I will say that I agree this movie had its fair share of problems. Pretty certain most of that was in post production.No matter what,, I luved the movie. It's Batman and Wonder Woman recruiting Aquaman, The Flash, and Cyborg to fight the big bad that's coming (STEPPENWOLF). When I first saw a pic of what Mamoa was going to look like as Aquaman, I didn't know what to think. 'Isn't he supposed to be in orange and green?' I thought to myself,,, but the more I looked the pic over,, the more I liked it (Auqaman is COOL now). Ezra Miller as The Flash,,, he's just too PERFECT!! Totally awkward and unsure,, in the best way possible (I've never done battle. I've mainly just pushed people and then ran away). Ray Fisher as Cyborg,, he was good,, I would like to see him again.Now,,, we all know the theatrical release was not the version that Snyder intended. Due to the horrible tragedy his family suffered, he had to step away from the project. Then Joss Whedon stepped in to finish post production and also do some reshoots (I have to say that I am a big fan of Whedon. Big fan!!! Loved all his TV shows. Really loved Avengers 1 & 2). I'm pretty sure this is where the horrible mustache debacle came in (oh my goodness that was terrible!!!!). Now,, regardless of how much I enjoy both of these directors work,, they don't necessarily go together. Whedon's work is funny and witty,, and Snyder's work is more dark and gritty (WATCHMEN anyone?!?). I think that is where this movie project went a little bit wonky. Regardless,, I still luv the movie,,, but it could've been better in several areas. Imo, the theatrical release of JL was not on the same level as BvS:The Ultimate Edition. I'm hoping (and expecting) THE SNYDER CUT to bring us what we really wanted to see the first time (if they'd shown the BvS:The Ultimate Edition instead of the theatrical release in theaters, it would've done SO MUCH better at the box office. I imagine The Snyder Cut will go the same way).Even with all the problems,, JL the theatrical release is still a great movie.So go watch it!!!",8,0,0,27 June 2020
Man of Steel," Snyder is genius!
","I remember hearing that the director of Watchmen was directing a Superman movie,, and I couldn't wait to see it!! I knew it was going to be something special (not that the CR Superman movies weren't great,, but that was then and this is now),, and I was right!!Henry Cavill couldn't be more perfect as Superman, could he? The look, the demeanor, the build,,, he just is Kal-El.
Amy Adams is always incredible, so of course she embodies Lois Lane in the best possible way.
I wasn't so sure about Michael Shannon as Zod when I first heard the casting (not that I thought he would do badly, not at all,, just not what I had in mind). I kept hearing 'Kneel before Zod!' coming from Shannon, and it wasn't really working. Luckily for us all,, he proved me wrong and delivered a great version of Zod, who (like they said in the behind the scenes) was more than just a great villain,, but a character who was pure in his mission, to rebuild the world he'd lost. In this version, one could almost say that Zod isn't so much a villain as he is just WRONG (seeing as how he's willing to do whatever it takes,, including killing everyone on earth). One could almost make that argument,,, (of course,, he's still a villain)
Russell Crowe as Jor-El,,, perfect.
Costner and Lane as Maw and Paw Kent,,, couldn't have been better.
The remaining cast was great as well.I loved how they made Krypton look.Also,, the score!!! Hans Zimmer strikes again!!
The score brings all the big moments together perfectly.I don't know why this only has a 7,, imo it's at least an 8.5!!One more thing,, remember that while superheroes are the 'good' guys,, there are actual scenarios in which there are NO good choices. There's only bad and worse. While a person can say, 'I'd never do this,' or 'I'd never do that,' you really don't know what you're gonna do or how you're gonna react to something until it happens to you!! Villians (in fiction or in REAL life) can't always be stopped without bloodshed. (Watch the movie and you'll know what I'm talking about)So go watch it!!!",8,1,1,25 June 2020
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Talk to the hand,, lol

","To anyone who went to see Iron Man in theaters when it came out,, and then followed the continuing journey as each new film debuted,,, this movie was the PERFECT conclusion (to what we've seen so far).

","Wow,,, this one is a mind cluster (for lack of less tasteful expressions). Not so much in 'I didn't see that coming',,, more in the 'wow, they're really doing this' kind of way.
If you have seen movies like A Clockwork Orange / Bronson / Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas that are just bizarre for bizarreness sake (yes, I realize that's not an actual word), and enjoyed them,, then this one is for you. If you just want to see something disturbing,, well, this will work for that as well. If you only watch Disney movies,, STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE.P.S. - certain parts of this really reminded me of THE WICKER MAN (2006),, just less funny (no overacting,,,,)",5,0,0,27 March 2020

The Witch," What the heck did I just watch?!?
","Ok,, the good.Acting - well done. All the characters within the family portrayed this era very well.
Cinematography - shot very well.That's about all I can say,,, I get that the movie was supposed to be about religious paranoia and whatnot (I'm a Christian btw,, and I try to keep in mind that Jesus has set me free from my chains,, not the 'I better not mess up' kinda thing),,, but I got lost in all the craziness.Overall,, didn't care for it.",4,4,5,7 June 2020
Joker," Nothing SUPER about this film,, just gritty reality.
","This movie defied all of my expectations. After seeing the very first teaser trailer I knew it was going to be something different, and to say it's different is putting it mildly.
Phoenix's performance is nothing short of groundbreaking. The way he perfectly portrayed the Psuedobulbar effect, and the toll that kind of physical and mental illness can take on a person,, OSCAR WORTHY!!",8,2,6,24 November 2019

Wonder Woman," What is with all the bad reviews?!? It's Wonder Woman on the big screen!! What's not to like?!?
","This movie should be in everyone's library! Patty Jenkins brought the amazon princess to life!!!The movie starts in present day (after the events of BvS:Dawn of Justice). Diana receives a picture from Bruce Wayne (the photo was seen in BvS), and begins to reminisce about what led to that photo of her being taken during WWI (yes,, the first world war).Diana was raised on Themyscira, Island of the Amazons. Her mother, Hippolyta, ruled the Amazons as queen. As Diana grows up, she is trained to be a warrior, as all the Amazons are.Themyscira is hidden from the outside world, but like all things hidden, it cannot stay that way forever. One day, while admiring the ocean view, Diana sees a small engine plane crash not far from their shore. Without hesitation, Diana dives into water and rescues the pilot from drowning. The pilot's name is Steve Trevor,, and he's an American working as a spy for British Intelligence in WWI,, and he's being closely pursued by the German forces,,,
I've been reading a lot of the reviews that say this movie is boring, and that Gal Gadot's acting was terrible,,, I don't know what movie they were watching or what they were expecting. (I'll agree there was one or two moments that I thought could've been acted better,, but then again I remembered that the character Diana has led a pretty sheltered life. Maybe Jenkins and Gadot were playing into that part of the character,, idk) I thought the movie was excellent all around! Gal Gadot is Diana Prince imo. She just looks exactly like what you'd imagine Wonder Woman would look like,, and I thought she portrayed her very well. The rest of the cast was great as well, including Pine, Houston, and Thewlis especially. I especially enjoyed the recreation of WWI and the creation of Themyscira (loved the Amazon warriors!!!). I cannot wait to see the sequel!!So go watch it!!!",8,4,12,27 June 2020

Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Dawn of Justice!!!!!!!!!!!!
","Before I start,, I must say I'll be referring to the Ultimate Edition version of the film (not that I thought the theatrical release was bad,, but I will agree that it was choppy and left a little bit of holes here and there. If they'd included a mere 10 mins of the extra that we saw in the Ultimate Edition then I'm certain people would've changed their minds on this,,
oh well)I luv this movie!!! I thought Snyder did a great job of including the origin of Batman within the first 5 mins (short, unsweet, and to the point). We see shots of Thomas and Martha Waynes funeral interwoven with shots of Bruce and his parents leaving the movies, and what transpires afterwards. Bruce runs away from the funeral proceedings and falls down an abandoned covered well,, where he finds a lot of new, winged friends (the shot of the bats and Bruce rising up is great!)Then we see a different version of the battle between Superman and Zod from Man of Steel,,, the version that Bruce sees from the ground in Metropolis. This is what sets Bruce off on his mission for most of this movie. He sees an alien monster fight that kills thousands of people and destroys a lot of Metropolis. He sees red.Flash forward 18 months,,, Superman saves Lois from terrorists in the desert,, and is made out to have killed a lot of innocent bystanders in doing so,,,At the same time in Gotham, people are scared,, especially the criminals. The Batman is taking on the job of judge, jury, and executioner in a lot of ways by branding criminals with his Batman symbol. Once
inside the prison, those branded are killed.I won't bother saying too many more things about the plot,,, don't want to give it all away.I do have to talk about one scene,, that has been horribly misunderstood and made fun of. The Martha scene - When I first saw the movie in theaters,, I thought the scene was great. Only after seeing all the backlash did I begin to question any of it. Batman wins the big fight between he and Superman. He does this by utilizing kryptonite found by Lex Luthor. Bruce makes 3 smoke bombs out of it, as well as a spear to deliver a final killing blow to Superman. After using 2 of the bombs on Superman, Batman has him down for the count, pinning him down by stepping on his throat! Before Batman drives the spear into him, Superman says, 'you're letting him kill Martha,' (him referring to Luthor who's had Martha Kent kidnapped in order to force Superman into a showdown with Batman,,, cause Luthor has been playing them against each other). This of course throws Batman for a loop,, mostly bc his mother's name was Martha (and Luthor had manipulated him by saying he let his family die (referring to his work family, of course,, knowing this would haunt Bruce bc of what happened to his parents)). So, Batman's starts screaming, 'why did you say that name!?!' It really messes with his head that Superman says this. Then Superman says, 'Find him,, save Martha.' Enraged,, Batman again screams, 'why did you say that name!?!' Lois comes into the scene at this point and runs to plead for Superman's life. 'It's his mother's name! It's his mother's name!' she says to Batman. Now,, my feelings about this scene may very well be different then others. I felt like Batman, upon hearing his own mothers name, started feeling guilty about who he'd allowed himself to become. The Batman we see in this movie (before this scene) is not the Batman that we've seen before. He's out for blood, in a way. He has convinced himself that Superman is an evil, alien being who will bring nothing but death and destruction to the world. He's convinced himself that it's his duty to neutralize this threat. Upon hearing Superman ask for his mother's life to be saved, and seeing Lois (who Wayne knows by reputation, at least) pleading for his life,, Batman realizes what he's allowed himself to become, and internally may wonder what would his parents think of him, and what he's doing. All of this coupled with the realization that he's been played (by Lex Luthor), makes Batman see that Alfred was right in an earlier scene of the movie (Alfred - 'The fever. The rage. The feelings of powerlessness. It turns good men cruel.') Batman steps away from Superman and Lois,, and throws the kryptonite spear away.
Now, a lot of people have referred to this as a sudden 180 where Batman and Superman become best friends bc their mothers shared the same name. That's fine if you see it that way,,, I just think you're completely wrong. The names being the same is (according to Snyder) how they started to create this scene. The main point is that Batman sees his errors and changes. He realizes that his been wrong (a lot of which is thanks to Luthor's manipulation), and wants to make things right with Superman (or as right as he can). That's what the scene is about!!!I really liked Alfred not only helps Batman. but also gets in on the action (like how he remotely takes control of the Batwing). I really wanted to see more of the banter between Bruce and Alfred, and their relationship,,, but of course there's only so much runtime, and we've seen that before,,,Now onto Wonder Woman,,, oh my!!! I loved how she was introduced in this movie. Plenty of screen time to be introduced, and plenty of back story, but not too much (sets up seeing her in WW perfectly).Okay, now that I've ranted for a good bit,,,Go watch it!!!",9,3,3,25 June 2020

","For 12 hrs, one night a year, all crime, including murder, is completely legal.
All emergency services such as police, ambulance/medical assistance, fire, etc will not be available. One night to Purge!While in reality this would be unbelievably horrific,,, I like how this trilogy shows what could happen if for one night a year, the laws that are put in place for our protection were simply disregarded for a short amount of time (12 hrs would seem like an eternity then). While I'm sure there would be a lot of people that would not want to participate in such a barbaric idea,,, there would also be a lot who would. (Btw,,, I would not at all want be one of those who would)So,,, draw your own conclusion as to whether this is something you want to view,,,",7,1,2,16 May 2020
A Nightmare on Elm Street," 1, 2,, Freddy's coming for you
","How can ya not like this? It's 80s horror gold!!!Unlike Leatherface, Michael Myers, and Jason,,, Freddy actually speaks!!! Not to mention,, he comes for you in your DREAMS!!!
The best part is how he toys with the victims! The other 3 are scary,, but Freddy is on another level.Not to mention,, this was Johnny Depp's first role,, he's come a lil ways since then,,,So go watch it!",7,2,2,2 May 2020
50_50," WoW!!! I expected this to be good,, but not this good,,,
","I remember seeing the trailer for this when it came out,,, planned on seeing it, but got busy I guess. Well,, now this movie takes on a WHOLE new meaning that it wouldn't have then. I lost my thyroid to cancer 6 yrs ago,, and while that has a much, much higher survival rate than what this character in the movie has,, still,, it's life altering cancer.Now,, all of that being said, this is an excellent movie! Levitt never ceases to impress me. Who'd have thought that kid from Angels in the Outfield would be giving performances like this (although,, he was pretty good as a kid). Rogen was his usual self,, but he brought the right amount of comedy. Kendrick,,, oh how i love thee ❤!! Especially when you play characters like this. Howard did a good job of playing the kind of woman I'm trying to avoid! Lol,, no really,, she's always great. Anjelica Huston rounds out the main cast as Levitt's worrying mother.Seriously,, this was really good. Go watch it!!",8,0,0,20 April 2020
