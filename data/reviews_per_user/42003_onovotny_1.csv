Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Excellent Movie!
","While at first I was not as much of a die-hard fan as many others, I find myself addicted to this movie.  So far, I have seen it 4 times in 3 days, and it has not gotten boring or dull yet.Some people complain about the annoyance of Jar-Jar...let me tell you, he grows on you the next few times you see the movie.  Jar-Jar is much more tolerable than the whiny Luke Skywalker in ANH.Overall, there is a lot happening in this movie plot-wise.  Enough so that you don't get everything the first few times you see it.  Only after several times do you notice items like a cameo by E.T. -- they are in the Senate.This movie blows you away with its stunning visual effects and action sequences.  I could watch the lightsabre dual for hours.  The pod race gets your adrenaline going, and your eyes are glued to the screen until the end of the race.In short, this is a movie well deserving of the name 'Star Wars.'  It is the foundation for what is to come, and will not disappoint any fan.",10,0,0,21 May 1999
