Black Swan," Seriously?
","I was so disappointed in this film. I had heard from others that it was not very good, but it was actually worse than I imagined. 1. Not one character in the movie was likable. 2. Natalie Portman looks like she is about to burst into tears through most of the movie. 3. I thought some of the actors had ballet lessons, but it was not evident in the film. If you are a ballet lover, then you will probably be disappointed. 4. I was underwhelmed by the special effects, even though they were the highlight of the film.First, I thought this was a film about ballet. Then I thought it was about insanity. Then I realized it was supposed to be a horror film. Finally I realized I just didn't care.",1,12,20,9 July 2011
