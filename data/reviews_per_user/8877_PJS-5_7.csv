The Blair Witch Project," 1 out of 5 stars 90% incompetent:Forget Pokemon,Star wars,W.W west THIS IS THE CON JOB OF 1999
","Pros:  Good for a few chuckles. Cons:  Proof that critical and popular moviegoing opinion can be quite absurd.The hype for this movie is quite absurd.Even the most respected film critics of professional and amatuer types drooled over this.Sadly so did a large portion of the public.The plot simply goes like this 3 filmmakers go into the woods to find the blair witch and they end up lost.This is one of the dumbest,most inept,boring movies of 1999.Sure blair witch isn't the only highly-hyped film of 1999 there are films like American Beauty,Three Kings,Being John Malkovich,Toy Story 2,The sixth sense,etc. were better than this movie.Even highly-hated films of 1999 like Pokemon the first movie,Baby Geniuses,Wild wild west were much better than this dreck.And no I'm not hating just because it doesn't have traditional scare tactics like big budget scares or cheaply made killers or just to sound different.I may be too nice for giving this film a 1 instead of a 0 but I find some of the intentional humor funny so it is at least worth a few chuckles.This film is purely for 'Arthouse' fans only sure although I'm not a big fan of arthouse flicks there are plenty of good arthouse flicks out there.But needless to say THIS ISN'T ONE OF THEM!Although it was more boring that irratating afterall this film could be fun if it were treated by the folks of MST3K.This film could've also been tolerable if they used the actual footage instead of this shotty re-make.Originality is not a bad thing. But this makes the concept of originality look like 'something nobody else was stupid to do'.Low-budget films can be good. Now I can't say this films budget should be bigger it just needs a better script.So please I know that films like Pokemon the first movie,Wild wild west,Star wars episode 1 are highly flashy but they are more entertaining than this thrash.Though it wasn't as bad as films like Very Bad Things and such but it was pretty close.After sitting through this film I actually felt sleepy so I guess it is at least good for some sleeping medicine.So please ignore the massive slobber over this and stay away from this unless you're a certain MST3K fan.So if you want to see a good critically aclaimmed flick see Toy story 2 or the sixth sense (which sadly didn't do as well as blair witch)or something like that.Hey say most of anything 1999 flick than this.(Sure films like 'Titanic' and '2001:A Space oydssey' weren't all that much but they were better than this.)",2,0,1,23 June 2000
Gremlins," *****,perfect 5 stars,cute clever mischevious intelligent & dangerous now just add incredibly underrated you get the good descip.'s of this film.
","Sure you might find the dark comedy sequel 'Gremlins 2' a bit better than this its still a great film & although the horror may seem weak it actually gets it so that you don't have to be a fan of the horror genre so that the film placed itself out well humor(especially the disney's 'Snow white' part),terror,good storyline,& the song & dance 'Super madness' so in another words the film is very good very underrated so I'll leave it at that.",10,0,1,1 July 1999
Alien: Resurrection," 1.5 out of 5 stars:Does show some pleasing moments but overall its another sci-fi gorefest.
","Starring:Sigourney Weaver(Galaxy Quest),Wynona Ryder(Girl,Interrupted)Genres:Sci-fi,HorrorRated R:For Graphic Violence,some language,mild sensualitySummary:Basically its your basic 'don't mess with dangerous monstrous forces' kind of film. Ripley gets resurrected as a clone. And she ends up fighting them aliens again!(SPOILERS AHEAD ALERT)And it is also one of those 'Just about everyone' dies sort of films. This kind of films are not always bad I thought 'Deep Blue Sea' was a good film and only 2 of the main characters came out alive. But still this is rather bad anyways.(SPOILERS END)The Good:The wisecracks are funny and there are some cool & suspenseful moments in here. The performances & SFX are decent but nothing for helping this film.The bad:Gore,gore & more gore. If that sounds good for you be my guest. Although this is the first Alien movie I have seen I hope the others are better. So I guess I can recommend this film to alien fans & certain others. Overall this film tries to be good but it isn't all that successful. I agree with Roger Ebert & his rating (which is a 1.5 out of 4 which is what I would've done if I went by that system). Heck the last alien killing makes me almost wonder if I am being too nice on this film. At least this is not as bad as the first Halloween film that I have seen which is the 6th one. (Don't worry folks at least I am still open-minded about the others).So overall if you think 'Batman & Robin' is the worst of 1997. Take a look at this little messy mess.",4,0,0,9 August 2000
Elizabeth," *.5,1.5 out of 5 stars,the campy braveheartish story of Elizabeth 1st(the virgin queen)
","Kinda odd on how the queen here could be called a virgin even though she & that lord robert guy had a really 'really' romantic time in bed. to start off it was incredibly campy (even though it didn't go down as campy as film's like 'The Swan Princess') the film is also a basic mix of a campy medieval romance film & the campy & stupidly gory braveheart. the film had an R rating for violence (which was basically a milder amount than braveheart),& sensuality(even though I don't really care all that much about that content part fans of this will feel a little jipped because the romance scene between Elizabeth & Robert was really brief & the only part that would satisfy the fans of this content is the sensual scene of a foreign royal official & one of Elizabeths lady-in-waitings),although what positive's thing I'll say is that it had some nice music & that little '3rd wife' crack made during the Bishop meeting was rather funny. so mainly a rather overrated-odd plotted film but mostly the good part was the nice music,makes me wonder if 'shakespeare in love' is a worthy look.",4,1,2,15 May 1999
The Mummy," **.5,2.5 out of 5 stars,Brendan Fraser as a bit dopey but a surprisingly somewhat hipper & funnier attempt of Indiana Jones
","With the exceptions of plot & film design & Sp.FX the way on how you can rate this film is its PG-13 content I'll show you: (This is not something I do commonly) Violence:Incredibly over-gruesome! at least the filmmakers were nice enough to block out the film's gory parts(which proves that censored graphic violence can have a good side which in this case prevented this film to be a dumb gorefest),this film along with the corpse Sp.FX make the much better film(**** out of 5 stars to be specific)transformers the movie look like a epidose from 'Barney & Friends'(note it did had its fair share of over-brutal violence but no where near enough as much as this film) Language:like most films(Top Gun,MST3K the movie,notable exceptions) the language wasn't all that needed but that's no big deal here. Brief Nudity:Don't be fooled by this part (note I'm NOT one of those hormone-surging perverts),there was no nudity in this film just the princess in the film was wearing an incredibly revealing outfit - true she was almost nude but not enough to be 'must be covered not to be seen by children' type of nudity,so basically there was no nudity. Sp.FX:Most of the Sp.FX in this film saved it from a much worse review,some of it actually helped to bring it down,The impressive:the Sp.FX in the beginning were actually the best as if they had help from the people of Pixar(Toy story,A Bug's Life),but after the ancient egypt prologue what wasn't in the unimpressive list did look well done but not as much in the prologue,unimpressive:I'll start with the mildest the face in the sand wasn't all that impressive,the 2nd worst the scarabs were more like leeches in this film & besides they more looked like little blue blobs than scarabs,now the worst the corpses(I can't really call them mummies which i'll get to in the plot),for the pre-teen to adult it'll more than likely nauseate you if you see the corpses on a moderately-to-full stomach & it places this film from the intended 'Well too scary for li'l kids' to 'Would probably traumatize to at least place li'l kids in thearapy for a long while' & the recently dead corpse's I'd wish the filmmakers were nice enough to block out the scenes of those corpses (but they wouldn't)Plot:A big problem to a big helper in this film,the plot is completelly weak & is rather bad at times(the only actual mummies in this film were the priests when they were mummified alive),& like what I'd said before the scarabs mostly were more like leeches,& the film was a big mild 'ROTLArk' parody not too mention that after I'd seen the reviews here I'd have to admit the pilot guy was rather wasted,but the only light part of the Plot & film was the moderately funny one-liners they'd never contend to great comic films but at least it gives a comic break from most of the films plot(not to mention the ancient-egyptian love scandal during the prologue was a little weak too)Film Design:What most I can tell you here is more relev. to the other areas,So I tell you a couple of noticed film flubs,1 the anubis jar tops -1 of them is a brass St.Wrs Yoda head I'd kid you not, 2nd when im-ho-top got his arm chopped off you can see the metal wiring on the sliced off arm before he placed it back on So in short:the 2 main reasons why I saw this film were 1:a mother's day present for my mother I saw it with her,2: (I know there's still plenty of the year) but I saw it so I've actually seen a movie this year(the last time I'd went to the M.Theaters was seeing the Rugrats movie back in Dec.98),so even though most of the special effects were impressive & the one-liners were funny the rest of this film is a freaky-I.J stylish-monster-mummy movie.",7,0,0,9 May 1999
American Beauty," 4.5 out of *****(Flawed but Grand):A bit flawed but it almost deserved all of its hype.
","Genre:Dark comedy,drama,satireRated R for drug use,violence,nudity,languageThe Summary:Basically its a serious yet comical observance of suburbia on how one family is pratically 'normal' to pratically folks on Jerry Springer.Kevin spacey,OK so this isn't 'A bug's life' but he was pretty close.It's premise was almost well-executed. (At least the premise was delivered better than 'Pleasantville'.)I'm not gay nor a homophob but the nudity in this film was actually well used part of the storyline instead of just a cheap thrill.Basically it was close to be 'The Truman Show' or the dark comedy world.So it may not be Best picture of 1999 but it was close.While the film may seem a bit iffy at first but it did well later on.(The awards people could've done so much worse they already did in previous years.)To be honest I could've gave this a lesser rating but it whouldn't feel right.Basically its what you get if you mix Good will hunting with Pleasantville. (With a bit of Ghost in the shell.)The homophobia in here was plainly dumb.Annette Benning wasn't bad in here although she was a bit annoying at times.There were other times in the movie when MST3K was in my mind in a certain way.Maybe I'm missing something here but it did miss something one of the messages in this film but this film did a bad job on what is 'normal'.This film is funny but not always in a good way.I'm not a pervert or anything but I found those 'flower' scenes a bit annoying.Intellect will never be a bad thing but I can only recromend this to those who are into 'deep & intellectual' films.The quotes:'I rule'-Kevin Spacey'How can I be mad when there is so much beauty in the world.'-Kevin Spacey",9,0,0,17 June 2000
Space Jam," ****.5,4.5 out of 5,a highly entertaining,widly hilarious,no disappointment to any L.T fan with great music.
","It may be seen as a big ad for Micheal Jordan but as still had a high amount of entertainment value(which was mostly done by the Looney toons gang),true Bill Murray was very commonly funny while Wayne knight was a bit annoying but remember thats what he commonly plays,true the 'Transformation' scene from Nerdluck to Monstar would be a bit frightening for the little ones but it was truly no big deal,the humorous bits on the movie were commonly funny (especially the 'Pulp Fiction' one) while the newbie character Lola(voiced by Rugrats,Kath Soucie) wouldn't disappoint L.T fans & well satisfy feminist's,1 definite grand thing you can say of this movie is the soundtrack(In fact it's my 2nd favorite soundtrack bottom of 'Blues Brother's' top of 'Transformer's the movie'),although the only bad thing I can say is that well you know they gave it a PG-rating for crude cartoon humor but personally I think it's because of the senseless brief bad language moment I hate when films do that, but still it's quite a good movie,even though you'd wish M.J would make up his mind when he's gonna stay retired or not.",Null,1,2,20 May 1999
