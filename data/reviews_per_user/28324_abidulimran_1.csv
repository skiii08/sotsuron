Blade Runner 2049," Worst acting by Gosling
",Dont waste your time watching this movie! Story almost non existing and dragged to a point that it doesn't make any sense. Acting by Gosling is worst. In all scenes he gives same expression and in every frame he gave a confused look. It seems he doesn't have other expression in his book. Avoid this movie. Save your money and time.,1,4,6,17 January 2018
