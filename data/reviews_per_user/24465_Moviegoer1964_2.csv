Casablanca," Simply the best movie ever made!
","This is my favorite movie of all time. Absolutely stunning direction, fabulous script, fantastic cast, and timeless love story of sacrifice to a greater cause. Bogart's Rick is possibly the best anti-hero in cinematic history ('I stick my neck out for no man!'). The quotes (and MIS-quotes) from this movie lend credit to its timeless appeal! From the first entrance into Rick's caf√© (expertly done through the use of a moving camera) you are drawn into a world of intrigue, love, lust for power, desperation and hope that was North Africa in the WWII era. The black & white photography allows the director to create and use shadows to set mood and tension. The script moves along at a breakneck pace until the final scene when our hero's true colors are revealed. Let's face it. If you don't see this movie you'll regret it. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon and for the rest of your life.",10,3,6,12 March 2007
The Lives of Others," Absolultely Stunning Must See Movie!
","I had heard a lot of good things about this movie so I was very interested to see it. Nothing I read prepared me for the experience. Herr Von Donnersmarck's use of camera angles and movement of the camera on stationary actors does an amazing job of creating suspense and just pulls you into the movie. Zemeckis used a feather in Forrest Gump to draw you to the edge of your seat and keep you there. Von Donnersmarck draws you delicately through outstanding character development with exceptional use of the camera and an outstanding cast and script.** SPOILER ALERT **Not since the death of Hana in The English Patient have I so felt the loss of the one left behind as the one in which Georg loses Christa-Maria. The pain is so real because you are so empathetic to the characters at this point in the movie that you literally feel as though you lost you own lover or sister, or other family member. Sebastian Koch's Georg is expertly developed and Christa-Maria's battles with herself and Georg are believably portrayed through the electronic eyes and ears of Wiesler (Ulrich Muhe). It is Wiesler's development and evolution from hard-core Stasi party-liner to a very human and caring sole that is most compelling. The best acting in the movie comes from Muhe (although the entire cast is exceptional!) as he begins to feel for the objects of his surveillance as we do. And the walk off line of this movie should go down with 'Louie, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship' as one of the best ever. This movie is so great on every level - script, directing, acting, and cinematography that I can't find anything bad to say about it. It truly is an 'experience' and one I recommend you take the time to see.",10,1,3,12 March 2007
