Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It felt like I got what I wanted for Christmas
","There's some movies that are a surprise and you walk out feeling like you've seen a landmark film, a film that makes you realize the power of movies. Raiders of the Lost Ark was one for me when I stumbled onto it during it's initial release. This is another. I had high expectations of this but it was far better than I could have guessed. I am completely in awe of George Lucas' imagination. This raises the bar so high in terms of creating fantasy worlds on the silver screen that I doubt we'll see other Filmmakers ever come close.If you liked the previous Star Wars films, you'll go crazy over this ... the crowd I was with certainly did (but if you thought the other films were strictly children's flicks, you still might not get it). In Phantom Menace there's a higher density of visual detail to drink in (which I loved as an amateur artist), the story is more sophisticated, the action is more intense, and you can see the intelligence that went into every little bit of it. I also enjoyed the textured performances of all the main characters, which would otherwise stand out more in a film with less dazzle. Lucas' team has effectively built their own fascinating universe that has the air of reality and given us a thrilling glimpse, and that's the point. Way to go, George! But what do you mean I have to wait a couple of years for the next one? Just list me as 'thrilled in Victoria'.",10,0,0,19 May 1999
