Resident Evil: Afterlife," The Movie was undead per Se!
","I was bored in the initial 15 minutes of the movie itself. Seems like the director went over the edge to feed us with crap. Initially i went in with great expectations,part 3 of this series gave us enough reasons to be frenzied over R.E:Afterlife, however,the movie fails to pick up speed and also fails to deliver on the creative aspect of any Sci-Fi movie.Some of the scenes are done fine,but, if you consider the art put in the movie,you will have disappointment rubbed on your face.1hour,25Minutes seemed like forever to me!If you are planing to watch that movie, i would suggest you, to download it,and if you still can't keep your money in your wallets, Donate it but don't waste it on this flick!",2,3,7,29 September 2010
