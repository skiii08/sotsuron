Ford v Ferrari," 'Ford v Ferrari' is a thrill ride with heart.
","'Ford v Ferrari' juggles enough fast cars, heart and fine performances to entertain you all the way through.
.
In this sports drama based on a true story, a team of determined engineers make it a mission to build a Ford vehicle fast enough to beat Ferrari in the 24 Hours of Le Mans.
.
Running a little over two and a half hours, 'Ford v Ferrari' can be tighter, but the film overall is a fun ride and a solid underdog story. Matt Damon and Christian Bale are a dynamic duo and offer viewers two whole-hearted and grand performances. Director James Mangold ('Walk The Line') makes you feel like you're on that race track and also makes you want to stand up and cheer. An entertaining piece of automotive history that not many people know about and well worth the watch.",7,6,18,14 November 2019
Rocketman," 'Rocketman' sets the bar high.
","'Rocketman' is a musical biopic for the ages. A film that will follow in the footsteps of Elton John and stand the test of time.In this musical drama, witness the human story of music icon Elton John.Unlike anything you've seen before; 'Rocketman' is a raw, emotional, flamboyant, fantastical biopic that leaves an imprint on you. This film is so beautifully made that you can't take your eyes off the screen. Taron Egerton ('Kingsman: The Secret Service') is beyond incredible; he doesn't simply portray Elton John, he is him. The musical numbers are sensational; it's hard not to sing along. I was entranced the entire time. I absolutely loved this film.",9,1,1,2 June 2019
Us," 'Us' is Sensationally Frustrating
","After attending the premiere screening of Jordan Peele's 'Us', I can't help but feel conflicted. The first two acts are sensational, but third is confusing and left me bizarrely frustrated.In this horror film, a family's vacation turns to chaos when a group of doppelgängers begin to terrorize them.Cinematically, 'Us' is ambitious, creative, darkly funny and even scary at times. Lupita Nyong'o ('12 Years A Slave') throws it out of the park with this home run of a performance. She is beyond terrific. You can see what writer/director Jordan Peele ('Get Out') is trying to do here, and kind of mirror us a society with these doppelgängers, but what's the actual point of them? I left the movie theatre super psyched but as I kept thinking about the third act, I was left with unanswered questions and that frustrated me. There is no doubt that the film's Peele is creating are some of the most diverse, horrifying, hilarious and original films of our generation; he is a master. The more I think about 'Us', the more I want answers. Maybe that's what Peele wants; for us to start a conversation and answer these questions. Who knows. All I know is that if you appreciate a vision, it's most definitely worth a watch.Go see it and let me know what you think.

Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga," Overly long with some funny moments.
","'Eurovision Song Contest: The Story Of Fire Saga' has funny moments but running a little over two hours makes it hard to fully enjoy.
.
In this comedy, when aspiring musicians from Iceland are given the opportunity to represent their country at the world's biggest song competition, they finally have a chance to prove that any dream worth having is a dream worth fighting for.
.
I'm going to say it again and again, but the real buzz kill here was the run time. There were many scenes that could've been edited out and many scenes (especially the contest ones) were repeated over and over. Ferrell and McAdams were surprisingly good together. Rachel McAdams delivers a funny performance you don't often see her portray. The real scene stealer though was Dan Stevens as the Russian competitor; I'd watch a movie just about his story. Overall, a few funny moments, catchy songs, but way too long, making it an okay film.

Knives Out," 'Knives Out' is so much fun.
","'Knives Out' is sharp, witty, terrific and tons of fun. Writer/director Rian Johnson has reinvented the genre and assembled the greatest ensemble cast in years.
.
In this murder-mystery film, a family hires a detective to investigate the mysterious death of their father at a family gathering.
.
From the opening frame you know that you're going to have a great time seeing 'Knives Out'. Rian Johnson's attention to detail is so evident here and works out perfectly. You can tell this writer/director has been wanting to make a movie like this one forever. Daniel Craig's performance is probably my favorite of his career; he's incredibly versatile. Ana de Armas absolutely nails it and honestly I think her performance is award worthy. The entire ensemble cast is put to good use which you don't see often in these cases. The twists and turns are so epic you will leave the room floored. Definitely one of my favourites of the year.",9,1,4,28 November 2019
The Irishman," 'The Irishman' is a flat out masterpiece.
","If you're looking for a masterclass in filmmaking, 'The Irishman' proves Martin Scorsese and his cast of legends can do it better than anyone in the game. A profound, compelling and slow-burning masterpiece.
.
In this crime drama, a mob hitman recalls his possible involvement with the disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa.
.
The hype surrounding 'The Irishman' is real and if you're a fan of cinema or Scorsese or crime films in general, this is one for the ages. Running at three and a half hours, the length of the film didn't even affect me or those I was with. The length is needed and every detail is necessary in 'The Irishman'. Robert De Niro is superb, Joe Pesci's performance is something you've never seen before; calm and collected, and Al Pacino is absolutely sensational. Upon leaving my seat I felt overwhelmed with emotion and overly satisfied with what I had just witnessed, which was much more than a mob film. Consider this Martin Scorsese's magnum opus and a riveting must-see.",10,7,18,18 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," The ending fans have waited for.
","'StarWars - The Rise Of Skywalker' may not be the best film in the 'Skywalker Saga', but the film remains action packed throughout until its fittingly nostalgic final moments.
.
In this sci-fi adventure film, a year after the events of 'The Last Jedi', the surviving Resistance faces the First Order once more in the final chapter of the Skywalker saga.
.
The 'Skywalker Saga' will go down as the greatest film franchise of all time and that's why despite mixed reviews, this ending could not be more fitting and I enjoyed this conclusion. I did feel that the film felt rushed at some points, but there's so much going on to end it all. There's tons of action, laughs, revelations, twists, turns and trust me not one detail is left out. Did I mention nostalgia? Tons of it. For me, the 'Star Wars' films were apart of my childhood. I remember seeing 'A New Hope' when it was re-released in 1997 and I've seen every 'Star Wars' film on the big screen since then. I could not think of a a better way to end an epic franchise. Don't get me wrong, it's not as great as 'The Force Awakens' or 'The Last Jedi', but if you grew up watching these films, 'The Rise Of Skywalker' will definitely leave a mark on you.",8,1,3,20 December 2019
Toy Story 4," 'Toy Story 4' is a ton of fun with a ton of heart.
","'Toy Story 4' is a beautiful, extremely funny and absolutely heartwarming addition to the perfect saga of family films. If you have your doubts, leave them at the door. This fourth instalment will leave a mark on you.In this family film, a new toy joins Woody and Buzz on an adventure that reveals how big the world really is.Boasting with excitement and adventure from the start, 'Toy Story 4' manages to keep momentum from the previous films and build it all the way until the film's tender final moments. The animation is beautiful, the voice work is superb as usual (a special shout-out to Keanu Reeves for his first ever voice acting credit), and the story is packed with great messages for all ages. That is a huge reason why the 'Toy Story' saga has been around for as long as it has; it's perfect for every age. As you grow older, you really understand the meaning behind these outstanding films and why they continue to resonate with you. Get ready to laugh, cheer and yes, cry. I loved every minute of it.",9,2,11,20 June 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," 'Once Upon A Time In Hollywood' is a cinematic masterpiece.
","There hasn't been a movie-going experience like 'Once Upon A Time In Hollywood' in many years. An epic love letter to everything Hollywood that only Tarantino could helm. A flat-out masterpiece.In this dark comedy-drama, a faded television actor and his stunt double strive to achieve fame and success in the film industry in 1969 Los Angeles.Writer/director Quentin Tarantino's attention to detail has always been one of his many trademarks, but in 'Once Upon A Time... In Hollywood' his focus never steers away from capturing the essence of 1969 Los Angeles. DiCaprio and Pitt are a match made in heaven; their performances are some of the best of their careers, respectively. Margot Robbie is sensational as Sharon Tate and really capturing her aura. The film altogether is Tarantino's magnum opus and if this is his final original film, he knocked it out of the park. 'Once Upon A Time... In Hollywood' is the best film I've seen this year and I can't wait to see it again.Do not miss this film.",10,49,73,28 July 2019
Aladdin," 'Aladdin' is full of surprises and tons of fun.
","Never mind the naysayers; 'Aladdin' adds a new twist to the Disney classic with some
of director Guy Ritchie's flair, and still manages to offer nostalgic moments. It's big, it's fun and you'll have a magical time.In this adventure film, a kind-hearted street thief is ordered by a Grand Vizier to bring him a magical lamp that possesses a powerful Genie.Here's the thing; I didn't think director Guy Ritchie ('Snatch', 'RocknRolla') was the right fit for 'Aladdin', but he really delivered. Will Smith as Genie also had a risky task to take over Robin Williams' portrayal, but Smith is a comic blast and really outdoes himself as the classic character; you'll love him and he's a scene stealer. Mena Massoud as Aladdin is great and a perfect fit. Naomi Scott as Jasmine soars in a powerful performance. Expect to see more from this fine actress. Colourful, vibrant, nostalgic, and destined to be a classic in its own right. 'Aladdin' delivers a diamond in the rough with tons of fun that will win audiences over young and old.",8,4,12,23 May 2019
The Lion King," 'The Lion King' still resonates after 25 years.
","'TheLionKing' is visually stunning feat and still manages to be full of heart, emotion and filled with nostalgia.In this family film, after a family tragedy, a young lion leaves his kingdom to learn the true meaning of bravery and responsibility.Director Jon Favreau's almost exact retelling of the classic Disney story comes to life again 25 years later with beautiful CGI and a voice cast for the ages. Hans Zimmer's thunderous score still resonates within you, along with Tim Rice and Elton John's songs that you can't help but sing along to. Of course the orignal 1994 film will remain the classic it is, but this remake is definitely an achievement in its own right. 'The Lion King' will move you, make you laugh and have you fall in love with the classic all over again.",8,0,1,21 July 2019
1917," '1917' is a cinematic achievement.
","'1917' hits you so hard it will leave you pinned to your seat. A masterful technical achievement and a breathtaking piece of cinema.
.
In this war drama, two young soldiers during the First World War are to deliver a message deep in enemy territory that will stop 1,600 men from walking straight into a deadly trap.
.
Director Sam Mendes ('American Beauty', Skyfall') has always been one of my favourite filmmakers just because he is so subtle, yet makes some of the best films out there. '1917' is great and should be seen on the big screen. From the opening scene you will find your eyes glued to the screen and your gut boiling with intensity. Cinematographer Roger Deakins ('The Shawshank Redemption', 'Blade Runner 2049') holds the bar for his style of creating beauty and pulse pounding frames, especially here with his 'one-shot' takes making the film seem like one continuous shot. I do not agree that '1917' is the best film of the year, but I do agree with the all the hype it's been receiving and you should all go out and see this film for yourselves.",9,0,1,10 January 2020
Hotel Mumbai," 'Hotel Mumbai' is intense and unsettling.
","'Hotel Mumbai' is a powerful yet ultimately disturbing film to watch. A true no-holds-barred drama that never lets go.In this drama based on a true story, hotel staff risk their lives to keep guests safe from a group of terrorists who attack the hotel.By the time 'Hotel Mumbai' is done, you'll need an oxygen tank to get your air back. A disturbing story but one that needs to be told. Terrific performances from the cast and hard to watch throughout. This film will shock you
and leave you feeling a way you haven't felt watching a movie in a long time. Disturbing, brutal but this film that leave a mark on you.Stream it now.",8,1,13,2 July 2019
Joker," 'Joker' is wildly unsettling and a near masterpiece.
","'Joker' is a daring, unsettling and masterful character study that will leave you in awe.
.
In this psychological thriller, a mentally ill failed stand-up comedian named Arthur Fleck, turns to a life of crime in Gotham City.
.
The thing I absolutely loved about 'Joker' is the slow burn. From the opening shot, Phoenix and Phillips are able to convey a knot in your stomach and that feeling doesn't go away until long after you've seen the movie. Joaquin Phoenix is the real deal. A complete game changer in method acting, he is hypnotizing. That is the perfect word to describe the performance; hypnotizing. A true Oscar contender and it will be hard to beat his performance because it is the best of the year. Will I compare Phoenix's performance to Heath Ledger's? No. That was the past and this is the now, and Phoenix's performance is what we need now. Aside from being a brilliant stand alone film, 'Joker' pays hommages to so many great films of its genre from the 70s and 80s. The cinematography is outstanding and the score is simply haunting. I'll also mention that you will never listen to Frank Sinatra's 'That's Life' the same again. Bottom line: yes, you should see this movie.

It Chapter Two," 'It Chapter Two' is a satisfying conclusion to a great horror film.
","'It Chapter Two' may not deliver as many scares as it's predecessor but still nails delivering the source material to the big screen, along with the help from a pitch-perfect cast.In this horror sequel, twenty-seven years after their encounter with Pennywise the Dancing Clown, the Losers Club reconnect in Derry after receiving devastating news.I'll come right out and say that the real MVP in this film is Bill Hader. Hader is superb in his role offering viewers enough of a comedic performance as much as a dramatic one. Jessica Chastain and James McAvoy are great, and Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise is just as terrifying the second time around. 'It Chapter Two' does feel long at some points, running close to three hours, the film needed to have its pacing arranged. Other than that, I enjoyed this sequel almost as much as Chapter One. You'll find yourself fully immersed once the Losers Club arrive in Derry and be fully satisfied in the end.",7,1,2,6 September 2019
Parasite," 'Parasite' is a masterful film.
","'Parasite' is a powerful and perfect film that will leave you in awe with its twisted, funny and tension-filled scenes. Writer/director Bong Joon-ho's approach to social classes creeps up on you like suspense in a Hitchcock film.
.
In this dramatic thriller with elements of dark comedy, an unemployed family schemes their way into working for a much wealthier family by posing as highly-qualified individuals.
.
Where to begin on how great of a film 'Parasite' is? Never has there been a film of this genre to exceed so much and so perfectly. All the performances are incredible, the direction is Joon-ho's finest and most masterful and the story is beyond relevant to all of us. You never know where 'Parasite' will lead you but when it gets there, it shocks you or it makes you laugh or even both. This film ranks among the best of the decade and definitely one of the best of the year. An absolute must-see.",10,13,20,4 December 2019
Marriage Story," 'Marriage Story' is powerful and triumphant.
","'Marriage Story' is one of those films that will leave a scar. A tough, draining and powerfully acted family drama, that ranks among the years best films.
.
In this drama, a married couple go through a coast-to-coast divorce while still trying to remain a family for their young son.
.
Writer/director Noah Baumbach has always payed close attention to detail and in 'Marriage Story' you'll find him searching for everything. Whether it may be closure, love, loss or divorce, this drama will affect you in some way. It's a beautiful piece of cinema. Scarlett Johansson is utterly sublime in a career best performance, while Adam Driver keeps on delivering and becoming an incredible actor. Laura Dern, Ray Liotta and the great Alan Alda all give fantastic supporting performances. Over the period of two hours and fifteen minutes, you see the decline in the two main characters and it is simply heartbreaking to the point where your stomach will be in knots. The 'living room' scene is some of the most powerful and raw acting I've seen in a long while. It's safe to say that Baumbach has delivered one of his best films. Stream it now and see for yourself.",9,5,8,11 December 2019
Jojo Rabbit," 'Jojo Rabbit' is a funny and daring satire.
","'Jojo Rabbit' is a smart, original and daring dark comedy. Actor Roman Griffin Davis is destined to become a bonafide star with a performance like this one.
.
In this comedic satire, a young boy in Hitler's army finds out his mother is hiding a Jewish girl in their home.
.
To mention that 'Jojo Rabbit' won't be for everyone is an understatement. This Nazi-mocking satire tests all boundaries of what is right and wrong but with its heart in the right place. Writer, director and actor Taika Waititi has made a genuine film that will divide its audience, but ultimately have them thinking of 'Jojo Rabbit' after the credits have rolled. The all-star cast is superb and hilarious. An overall exciting movie-going experience.",7,2,6,20 November 2019
Da 5 Bloods," The most original, daring and best film of 2020.
","'Da 5 Bloods' proves yet again that there is no other living director that can tackle social commentary like Spike Lee. A hard-hitting and original vision unlike anything Lee has made before.
.
In this war drama, four aging African-American vets return to Vietnam in search of the remains of their fallen Squad Leader and a gold fortune they buried while stationed there.
.
How is that that Spike Lee is ALWAYS around when we need his films most? 'Da 5 Bloods' is the timeliest of timely films in the world we are currently living in. We need more stories about black vets; why isn't this happening? HOLLYWOOD MAKE THIS HAPPEN! Every one of 'da bloods' deserves an Oscar nomination, but Delroy Lindo deserves a Best Actor win, hands down. Lindo has always worked best under the direction of Spike Lee and this is his career defining performance. Lindo's portrayal of a vet with PTSD soars throughout but in the latter part of the film, his decent into madness fuelled by greed is astounding and unforgettable. Anyone else notice religious allegories in this film? No spoilers. Of course Lee's longtime music collaborator, Terrence Blanchard's score is yet again on point and the choice to use tracks from Marvin Gaye's 'What's Going On' album is majestically haunting. 'Da 5 Bloods' is without a doubt the best film of 2020 and I can't stress enough how Spike Lee is one of the most original and daring filmmakers of all time. You must see this film.
