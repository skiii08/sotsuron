The King's Speech," Just marvelous
","How good it is to go to see a movie, enjoy it from the moment it starts until the moment it finishes and then go on enjoying it as you excitedly discuss it with your partner on the way home. No ludicrous nonsensical screenplay, no boring predictability, no ancient clich√©s, no inane posturing such as you would get from someone like Michael May, just quality entertainment with everything tight as a drum. Why can't there be numerous films like this? Why does it have to be that only occasionally a movie turns up that is an absolute delight. So, go and see The King's Message, enjoy every last second of it - as you will - and bear in mind that heaven only knows when something as good as this comes along.",10,3,6,16 January 2011
