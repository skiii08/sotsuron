Requiem for a Dream," The most intense movies I ever seen.
","This movie is a much see for everybody over 15! The movie is briliantly filmes and directed and the cast does a great job. The way the lives of the carecters follow the flow of the seasons, sommer everything is great, winter lives sucks!! Beware of a intense rollercoaster of emotions, and personal disasters. Not for the light hearted.",10,0,1,27 May 2002
Donnie Darko," Dark, brilliant and unforgetable.
","This movie is so great, if you like Memento and Reqiuem for a Dream, you will like this one. The acting, the locations, the music is all superb. This is a must se 10 out of 10!! Jake Gyllenhaal (Donnie) and Jena Malone (Gretchen) both great young actors with very promising careers in front of them. So just one thing to do, go see this great picture.",10,0,1,4 August 2002
