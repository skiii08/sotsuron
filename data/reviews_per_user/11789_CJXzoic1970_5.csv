Kill Bill: Vol. 2," One Point
","Interesting - in post 9/11 I found the most unrealistic point of this movie (KB1 and 2) is that 'The Bride' can move so effortlessly from the USA to Japan and back to the USA and then to Mexico and back not only slaying dozens of people in her wake - with no police on her trail - but more amazingly she's relaxing on the plane rides with a huge Hanoi Sword!!!! They arrest you @ the airport now with a letter opener!!!   What - did she slay the Marshalls and stewardess and hijack the plane to get to her destination??   Why wasn't the Air Force and Marines waiting for her when she landed??  Homeland Security failed us on this one!  But then we would still have Bill running around.  Oh well, I guess it's all for the best!  :)",10,2,4,12 August 2004
The Bourne Identity," Bourne Good
","Extremely engaging thriller!  Completely captivating action sequences that were believable and went well with the drama entrenched plot.  You feel the main protagonist confusion and desperation as he struggles to gain control of his upside down life.  Definitely more satisfying than other unbelievable recent action pictures such as XXX. Franka Potente was an excellent choice as the damsel in distress and love interest.   As superb as this movie was put together it also notoriously has the biggest glitch I've ever seen overlooked!  Especially now on DVD you can freeze frame and study the scene to witness what I did.  Follows: The scene where William Wombosi is angrily discussing the attempted assassination attempt on him with his trailing behind aide and a security guard.  Wombosi walks quickly through his house in a tight black mock turtleneck that shows his massive belly.  His holds his sport jacket over his right shoulder.  We make a turn into a hallway not only does the security guard dissapear so does Wombosi's jacket!  Wombosi descends the stairs still ranting about getting Bourne's head for a lawn ornament and he passes the open window!  Bamm!  The window shatters and I'm thinking the sniper hit the aide!  No - Wombosi now fully wearing the jacket, seems to have been facing the window, twists and spills his glasses and somehow makes it all the way down the stairs in his aides arms!  Unbelievable the editors missed this but yes rent or buy it today and catch it!",8,0,1,21 January 2003
The Transporter," Top Notch Stunts
","I agree this movie is the equivalent of fast food-quick satisfying and fulfilling but nothing to last substance wise.  A little more input could have been developed between Jason and his 'Package' but it's okay how they quickly built it up.  What does last is the out of this world action scenes. A leadfoot like me did not need to see what new tricks to do with a stick shift.  And is it just me or is all these new actions flicks in Europe such as XXX, Bourne Identity and Transporter all of the driving is on the driver left side and the right side of the road like America.  This some type of common glitch from American directors or do they really switch what side of the road they drive on?  Very confusing.",8,0,0,10 May 2003
The Matrix," Animation Origins
","Okay- Loved the Matrix and Reloaded and will probably love Revolutions just like plenty of others. Only complaint would be thinking to hard with some of the blabbo mind job talk. My reason for adding this is a funny trivial antidote for some of the philosophical questions surrounding the origins of this fairy tale. Anybody remember the old Ray Bradbury cartoon 'Little Nemo'? Was watching with my child the other day and busted a gut when Nemo goes asleep and enters 'Slumberland' and meets up with King Morpheus! I'm thinking -- Okay back in grade school the little Wachowski brothers read the same book and said 'Hey! Sounds like a great idea for a full blown sci-fi epic, let's add some cool dance music and jazzy special effects and add deep meaning to Nemo (now NEO) journey into Slumberland (now the MATRIX) and save King Morpheus (Uh, MORPHEUS). Pretty ironic huh? Have to probe the brothers next time I run into them at the Quickie Mart. :)I wrote this in October of 2003 highly expecting a debate over my uncovering of this little known comic which looks to be the muse for the Matrix series. Looks as if nobody even researched or counter-reacted my findings so I have to ask again in 2010 - did the Wachowski brothers watch Little Nemo and come up with the Matrix - and if they did unfortunately they are not original! Nonetheless I still regard Matrix series as one of my all time favorites just seeking the white rabbit...",10,0,1,7 October 2003
Da 5 Bloods," Bloodlines
","Hella good war flick to add to Spikes legacy. Good premise, great actors, socially conscious. Was very relevant to the trauma caused by war to its victims, the soldiers PTSD, lingering landmines, and the aftermath drama that carries on to the families. Biggest drawbacks was Spike should have used younger men for rhe throwbacks. It was very confusing watching old men play their younger counterparts. It distracted also from the emotional connection of seeing before and after. It would have given a higher reaction to the ending revelations. Crazy how it turned out but fitting. The lost flame should have been older even if she was a young prostitute she would be graying at least. Her daughter looked appropriate in her 40s.",7,2,4,17 June 2020
