10 Cloverfield Lane," Had Potential to be a really good movie
","To me, the movie seemed to have two story-lines. The first one is about this man that seems to be nice, but the others discovered a dark secret of his. The second one is about the aliens. These two different story-lines do not gel well at all. The movie should have been all about the aliens. The movie started very slow and picked up somewhat in the middle. I almost fell asleep. There was really no plot. I like a movie that builds slowly on the plot until the end. To give credit, the movie in the middle and towards the end was entertaining, but I appreciate a good plot. I left the theater filling a little empty.I don't have nothing else to say but I must meet the 10 lines of text minimum.",6,0,2,7 April 2016
Lucy," What it could have been?
","The movie started out great with action from the start. The plot leading into the the movie was OK. The action at the beginning was great and preceding to the middle of the movie the action was also good. Then all of a sudden, the movie got lost. I was in the theater wondering what happen. The plot and the action was totally gone. This could have been a really good movie, but the end of the movie cast a black shadow on the entire movie. The movie at the end was really stupid. The movie seemed very far fetch at the end. I am on the edge of recommending this movie to other viewers. Caution - Not a great movie. I would have given this movie a rating of 5, but it was entertaining for about 80% for the movie.",5,5,15,26 July 2014
