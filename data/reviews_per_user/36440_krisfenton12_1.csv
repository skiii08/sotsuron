The Ring," Theory
","This movie is interesting in that it seems to evenly divide reviewers. It's either creepy, or it's moronic.  To tell the truth, I didn't find it all that creepy. However, I do think I understand why so many people do. First, the movie goes out of the way to throw stylistic (no, the Seattle-area really doesn't look that depressing), creepy images that are calculated to disturb the viewer. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.  Second, I do think that the underlying issue is what is really giving some viewers the willies.  That issue of course, is child-abuse and murder.  Almost all of us are greatly disturbed by the very notion of abusing and killing children, the driving theme in this film. I am of the opinion, that without that element, very few viewers would have found the story as chilling as they did.  The abuse affects us (the viewer) psychologically, on a conscious or unconscious level, making us more susceptible to the dark and chilling images in the film (which in most other films would be cliche-it's hard to be truly disturbed by the murders of over-sexed teenage jerks).  Just a theory.  Feel free to shoot holes in it.**1/2 out of ****, appreciate the effort of the filmakers.",Null,1,2,15 June 2003
