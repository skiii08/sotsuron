Requiem for a Dream," Wow.
","I just saw this movie, and I am feeling absolutely blown away by everything about it. The cinematography, while being stylish, never strayed from the point of the film. The acting in the movie was spot-on. The overall theme of the film was well-expressed, and many scenes from this movie will stay with me for the rest of my days.The movie is basically about the lives of four people spinning out of control because of drugs. The great thing about the way the story is told is that it is extremely dramatically shot and edited so that it never loses its fast pace.This movie certainly makes you feel like the characters as they descend into the hellish lifestyle that comes along with drug addiction. This is probably due to the great acting and the well-written story that never stumbles on itself. Like said before, the pacing is so damn fast that you never feel like it's dragging on.To sum it all up, this movie is definitely one that shows how drugs can destroy lives, and it does it very effectively. It was extremely impactful, and I suggest it to anyone who feels like they can handle the subject matter.",10,0,1,7 November 2005
