The Ring," Almost Perfect
","I saw this movie the other night and although I don't get 'spooked' by horror flicks, I really found it intriguing.  Just as you think it's about to end...BAM! the movie has a twist, well kinda.  Anyway, this is a must to see.",10,1,1,28 March 2003
Gone with the Wind," Frankly My Dear, This Movie Sucks
","The only and I do mean the only reason why I gave this movie a 2 and not a 1 is because of the most famous line in the movie...you know what it is. Otherwise, I would rather swim in an ice cold pond filled with extremely hungry (insert fish or animal of your choice here).  This title drags on and on and on even more.  After 90 minutes have past you start become one with the movie...but little do you know this is only the beginning of a downhill slope and at the bottom of the hill there are land mines that will explode you into pieces of guilt and shame.  I suggest this title to those who wish to fall asleep.",2,14,39,27 October 2003
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Kill Bill...Killer Movie!
","What can I say but wow.  The story is excellent.  Action is superb.  The characters are outstanding.  Everything about this movie was awesome.  There is one scene that I thought should have been a tad different but it was a very, very minor useless idea I had.  I don't want to spoil anything so if you wish to e-mail me and ask me 'what would you have changed?' I would be happy to answer.  The ending is absolutely perfect.  I gave this a 10...it deserves it.  Rule 1: this movie rocks Rule 2: if you disagree, read rule 1 again.",10,0,1,12 October 2003
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," George Lucas Strikes Back...And Delivers A Masterpiece!
","Let me first say that I am a huge Star Wars fan, but like many others I was a tad disappointed with PM, but AOTC was pretty darn cool. Now, now we see it all come together in this dark, very dark installment. During some parts of the movie I felt a knot in my stomach, as in 'oh my gosh, I can't believe this is happening.' After three long, painful years of waiting, I can safely say the movie was well worth the wait! I don't want to give away any spoilers, but I promise that if you like action, you'll love this movie. If you like R2-D2, you will love this movie. Yes, R2-D2 kicks butt, puny it may be but strong it is.Anakin Skywalker from the beginning of this movie, after the demise of Dooku, begins his journey to the dark side. Now if you haven't seen this movie, I won't tell you why he does, but let's just say he did it to help someone he loves.How can I forget my little green friend, Yoda? Yoda has never been better in my opinion and we get to see him once again in action, against the sinister Darth Sidious.The dialog between Obi-Wan and Anakin is just pure aww, especially during their fight. Anakin even cries in this movie! I hope I didn't give too much away, and I hope this information was helpful. To those who didn't like this movie, or flat out hated it: go back to your world of candy-canes and marshmallows, where you belong.'The dark side of Lucas is a pathway to create a movie worth watching 10,000 times.' 'Is it possible to see this movie?' 'Not without a ticket.'",10,2,8,19 May 2005
