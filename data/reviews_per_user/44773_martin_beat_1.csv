Ali," Good, although a little biased.
","On the whole i was fairly pleased, and really enjoyed Ali. Rather than repeat most things already said by other users i will only highlight a few problems i have with the film. I have been really into Ali for several months now, and have done a lot of reading, watching and research on the famous boxer. I admire him tremendously and believe he is the greatest sporting/social figure of our time. However, there were a few problems with the film. 1) The portrayal of the Nation of Islam was a little loose. The nation was ran by a bunch of lunatics, believing in violence and black superiority. Civil rights and equality was not part of their agenda. 2) The majority of Ali's actions were dictated by the orders of the Nation, and Ali conformed to these orders. The film did not show this, and preferred to show Ali as spontaneous etc... 3) During the impose ban on Ali's career, he was broke. The film slightly approached this with reference to the burger joint, but did not mention Ali acting in a play and lending money of other fighters such as Joe Frazier.4) I was diisapointed that the film ended with the foreman fight, like most documentary films on Ali have. Ali fought Frazier for a third time after the Foreman fight - and it is without doubt the greatest fight of all time.However, i agree with all the plus points raised, as the was a good film.",Null,0,0,4 March 2002
