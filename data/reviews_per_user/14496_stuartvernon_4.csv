The Ring," A Pretty Decent Remake
",I saw this in the cinema back when it released in 2002 and I haven't seen it since. I then saw this in a box set with the sequel at the charity shop for Â£2 and bought it.I know this is a remake of the 1998 Japanese film I have yet to see.The story is of a videotape that kills anyone that watches it a week after. A journalist's son watches the video and she has to figure out how to stop it.The son is odd and has  taken out of him in a Scary Movie film. The atmosphere is quite creepy and the long haired girl is quite scary to see. The only thing I hated was a well known TV scene was CGI'd and she crawled out too fast.I would give this a watch.,7,0,0,4 May 2020
Pretty Woman," Take This Review As A Comedy Review
","When this came out I was 7 yrs old so I saw it a few years later.For a Rom Com.I actually liked it and I only like a few Rom's.In this Julia Roberts plays a Prozzie called Vivian and she meets Edward (Richard Gere) who spoils her for the week they are together and they.... guess the rest. Yep you guessed it - he murders her and uses her face as a mask to go on a giant killing spree lol.There is 1 thing I noticed, on the cover Gere's hair is jet black but in the film its grey.All in all its a decent film.",8,0,1,4 May 2020
The Wolf of Wall Street," One Of Leo's Best Films
","I actually enjoyed this, the stuff Jordan got up to was extreme and quite funny.Its about Jordan Belfort who rises up and becomes a millionaire stock broker and starts enjoying the money too much.Leo is brilliant in this and I am surprised he didnt win an award.",9,1,1,4 May 2020
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," The 1st Ever Disney Film
",This is the 1st Disney animated film and one of the best.The story is the Queen is well jell of Snow White and plots to murder her so she runs away and meets 7 Dwarves.There has been plenty of dirty stuff to come out of that situation but this isn't the dirty version.The dwarves a loveable and the songs are legendary. Also the queen was well sexier than Snow White and Snow White was a bit dim... in the oh a man lets run away like a child before my womanly brain explodes,7,0,0,4 May 2020
