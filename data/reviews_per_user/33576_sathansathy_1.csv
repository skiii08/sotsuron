Skyfall," Well below par, even Question of Sport was better
","Spoilers have tried to be avoided but sometimes you just cannot. I also have only wrote this review to balance the critics' rave unwarranted reviews.First off I can't pour scorn on Mendes, to be fair the cinematography and direction are not at fault. But I cannot see how the same person who wrote Casino Royale's script was involved in Skyfall's script. But can see the same nonsense from Die Another Day. Mr Purvis hang your head in shame. Secondly, plot holes can be forgiven when they are few and far between, but this film is riddled with them like a fallen gang member from south central LA. Thirdly, Skyfall's title sounded good, but it turns out to be the name of Bond's ancestral home, hold on he is an orphan, but an orphan with a stately home with lands to match and a grounds-keeper too, Richie Rich anyone.And in closing a movie that built up for a while ended too quickly with a whimper, and every 'shock' was obvious from a mile away. Mallory, Moneypenny, Silva's escape etc.The only reason this film is not a 1* in my opinion is because Craig and Bardem actually acted quite brilliantly, with a very poor plot, generic dialogue and poor supporting cast (except for the perennial giant that is Ralph Fiennes).Goldfinger and Casino Royale tie for 1st place for me in terms of Bond movies, this does not even register a blip on the radar, highly overrated tosh!",3,8,18,9 January 2013
