Alien 3," Underrated and misunderstood
","I looked through 12 pages of reviews on IMDb for this film & they were all negative. Well I'm gonna stick up for this film. I love it! Everyone seems to moan about how it messes up everything Alien & Aliens set up. I say great, life doesn't work out how you want it. You don't always get the girl & live happily ever after. The whole point of killing off Hicks & Newt at the beginning was to set up that feeling of 'oh crap, we're in a world of sh1t & all bets are off'This film is dark & gloomy & is all about redemption, looking back on the path you've taken & how it's affected your life & everyone around you & the sacrifice you make for the greater good. David Fincher did a great job directing considering he never had a full script to work off & Fox screwing him over at every turn (especially in editing).The set design, music score & lighting are all top notch.. Although to really appreciate this film you should watch both the Theatrical release & the assembly cut of the film. Don't listen to all those negative reviews and give this film a chance..",9,5,70,16 January 2009
