Child 44," Really really good.
","This is the movie that finally got me to sign up for an IMDb account so I could write a review, after several years using the app on a regular basis. Child 44 is excellent, top notch acting by superb actors, great writing and directing. It seemed a little slow off the start, but it's such a great story, with such deep and dynamic relationships (especially between the two main characters) that I got more and more involved as it went on. I cannot say enough about Tom Hardy, he's a brilliant actor, rivaling all the current big Hollywood names. Several viewers commented on the truth and historical accuracy of the film, someone even called it propaganda. That's simply ridiculous, the movie was based on a book. The book came from a brilliant author's creative mind.",8,0,2,25 June 2016
