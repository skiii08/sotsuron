Ford v Ferrari," A true story told in its best way, Amazing
","Fact' if you wanna watch this movie You don't need to know anything about cars , this Is a true story is not all about Racing, though ;
The title should be Miles And Shelby and the rest vs Ferrari ,
'Miles' played played by the one and only Christian Bale who delivers one of the best performance this year outstanding,
'Shelby, Matt Damon on his top as always
Breathtaking Movie From the beginning to the end gives you that kinda boost that kind energy you want as a viewer , just wonderful movie !! Bravo!!
