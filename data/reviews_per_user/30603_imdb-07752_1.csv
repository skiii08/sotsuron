The Lobster," Yorgos Lanthimos is a Sociopath
","Much can be learned from this movie. The passive reception by the audience of the most horrific displays of inhumanity evokes a sense of wonder. Why do they tolerate these affronts? Are they unaware they are descending into a meaningless hell? Challenging conventions and the established order can be heroic, or as we learn, it may be demonic. The convention that no humor can be found in bludgeoning a frumpy and lonely woman is not a convention we need to examine. These metaphors are facile where they are not utterly without carry, as for instance, when the twerking metaphor is followed immediately by porn sex. In the darkness of the theater we have been molested together.",1,10,15,6 June 2016
