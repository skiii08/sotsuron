Marie Antoinette," A complete waste of time...
","Two hours of my life and 4 bucks rental I'll never get back. I watched the whole blamed thing expecting to see... well, read it for yourself--an excerpt from the Marie Antoinette article at Wikipedia...'On the morning of October 16, 1793, a guard arrived to cut her hair and bind her hands behind her back. She was forced into a tumbril and paraded through the streets of Paris for over an hour before reaching the Place de la RÃ©volution where the guillotine stood. She stepped down from the cart and stared up at the guillotine...At 12:15, Marie Antoinette was executed. Her head was exhibited to a cheering crowd.'",1,6,10,30 March 2007
Hero," What a beautiful nap!
","This movie lulled me into the best nap I think I 've had in years. But before I went to sleep, I was treated to some of the most breathtaking cinematography I've ever seen. The fight scenes are all inspired and the colors are so vivid and beautiful to watch. (Especially 'Duel in the Yellow Forest'). Hollywood should plug one of these movies into their plot machine and make something with a story people can follow, but with the same depth and feeling as 'Hero.' The movie is about an attempt to assassinate a King, I think. But more importantly, the images sing like a sublime, romantic symphony. Coherent and linear storytelling might have been a distraction from the film's beauty. Forget the hazy, murky plot and just enjoy the colors, the characters, and their love and hatred for one another.",8,0,0,14 June 2005
Casino," 'The Italian Trilogy'
","The third movie in what I call 'The Italian Trilogy', 1)Raging Bull, 2)Goodfellas, 3)Casino. Every time it comes on Bravo or USA I find myself trapped in front of it (despite the bad dubbing). I used to think the movie was just Scorsese's manufactured form, but I believe now the movie is inspired from start to finish--from Deniro's silhouette floating in the fire during the opening credits and operatic music to him at the desk with the giant eyeglasses at the end saying 'And that's that.' Stone, Pesci and Deniro were all good enough to be nominated--too bad Sharon didn't win. Even James Woods was good as Sharon's old boyfriend. Its just one great scene after another for the whole three or four hours, peaking with their meeting in the desert ('...you're only out here because a ME!') The movie works on every level, the acting, screenplay, directing and everything else in between.",10,1,1,20 June 2008
