Hereditary," Horriditary
","I expected a film comparable to the Woman in Black or even Winchester, or the Grudge...but instead it was an exercise in how different people deal with tragic death in their lives. Too me, it was disturbing. I wanted to be entertained with scary, ghost house doings, but the tragedy of the events in Toni Collette's character's life left me with a sense of dread, and sadness. Initially expecting spooky scares...what was really scary was watching her character slowly dissolve into insanity. I was looking for something the film did not deliver.",2,20,47,9 June 2018
