Requiem for a Dream," The best movie ever made! 10/10 Aronofsky is a genius!
","Requiem for a dream has to be one of the most shocking, intense, visceral, heartbreaking, shattering and disturbing films ever committed to celluloid. It takes place in Coney Island, New York linking four characters all revolved around one... Harold (Jared Leto). His lonely mother Sara(Ellyn Burstyn), his beautiful girlfriend Marion(Jennifer Connealy)and his best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans). It takes place over three seasons and seamlessly shows the downfall of these characters. Starting off with summer where their dreams are all being realised and fulfilled, moving to fall where everything slowly starts going downhill and then winter, the slow self destruction of all the characters we've loved throughout. The acting is sensational particularly from Elly Burstyn as the lonely widow who is heralding 'being on television' as her dream and her pathway to recognition. Leto is also mind-blowing. and so is Jennifer Connealy. Marlon Wayans is shockingly good in a serious role, carrying a smile for the first half of the movie but then a face of confusion and pessimism as the movie goes on.The shame is that not that many people will see this film. I urge everyone to watch it.",10,0,1,4 April 2005
