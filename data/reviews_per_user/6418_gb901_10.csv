National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Distinctly run of the mill, paint by numbers sequel
","This film is underwhelming in every aspect: the characters are sickeningly know-it-alls and they incredibly conveniently are able to circumvent all security measures instantly and extracate themselves from every tight squeeze invariably using gee whiz computer wizardry!
Massive yawn.",3,0,4,24 July 2019
John Wick," Rapidly gets very monotonous
",Movie is essentially JW running around shooting loads of Russian gangsters in the head - most of which whom seem to give him plenty of time to do so!,4,3,8,18 February 2019
Nacho Libre," Very funny film
",All those who accuse it of racism and cultural appropriation are just the humourless perpetually offended imo,8,3,5,24 November 2019
Yesterday," Paper thin premise
",I was more concerned about the global blackout and it's causes!,3,13,32,1 July 2019
Jurassic World," Nephews gyrosphere and I-Rex route goof
","The two kids travel north - in the direction of the I-Rex restricted paddock area - then find the gate forced open inwards (presumably by the I-Rex) and go through it. They are then attacked and the escape the gyrosphere, but when and how had the I-Rex remained in the northern part of the park after smashing the gate as we see the corpses of numerous brachiosaurs it has killed in the park and then it's north of the gate again at the original 1993 JP centre - it appears omnipresent!",7,0,1,27 May 2018
"McFarland, USA"," Ridiculous
",The race scenes had the McFarland team running at sprint pace: they'd barely finish a 10k let a cross country circuit and was appeared more suited to sumo wrestling!,3,1,6,13 July 2019
Arrival," The height of Hollywood pretentiousness
","Utter squit - the alien language gives humanity the ability of 'a non linear perception of time' - effectively giving us time travel?
Ever since interstellar film makers are falling over themselves to be ever more pretentious and give their films 'meaning.
This film is just the equivalent of over two hours of navel gazing!",3,2,6,26 May 2019
The Water Diviner," Crowes attempt to ingratiate himself with Turkey
","All very one sided: painting the british as colonial aggressors and Turks as the oppressed - when, infact, turkey has been involved in more than its own far share of genocides! I can only assume this was funded by Erdogan?",3,4,12,14 January 2020
Win Win," Enjoyable but flawed
","So struggling middle aged lawyer with young family pulls a fast one to pocket $1500 each month being his court appointed guardian however, this leaves uncomfortable realities of: who pays old geezers care home fees? Another lawyer uncovers his ploy thus surely ruining his reputation among the legal community? He's ultimately left without the additional monthly income but with an additional 16yo to his family - if he couldn't manage financially before how can he afford this extra individual to feed and clothe?",7,0,1,1 February 2018
The Nice Guys," Fantastic morbidly black comedy
","Very, very enjoyable. Remember it being released back in 2016, and, as not a particular fan of either of the two leads, didn't give it serious consideration and as a result didn't watch it.
Oh, what can error if judgement on my behalf.
I can only imagine individuals bemoaning this on IMDb aren't nuanced enough and that it goes totally over their heads?",9,0,0,29 June 2020
