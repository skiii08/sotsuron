The Avengers," An amazing experience
","Joss Whedon really delivered with this movie. There was more action and comedy than you can wish for wrapped in a superhero-movie. After 5 movies the superheroes from Marvel finally assemble in this two-and-a-half-hour-long-roller-coaster of fun. All the actors do an amazing job in bringing their characters alive. Especially Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner does a great job. Robert Downey Junior has become his character by now, Tom Hiddleston has grown as Loki and the rest of the superheroes give solid performances. Only Scarlett Johansson could improve in the comedy department, but it is partly the fault of the writers for giving her unfunny jokes. Johansson makes up for it in the action part, though. If you are a fan of superhero-movies and probably even if you aren't, The Avengers is a recommendation for you.",8,2,6,30 April 2012
