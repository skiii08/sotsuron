The Blair Witch Project," One well done film
","This film confuses the line between reality and fiction so much, it is hard to realize what is really happening.  I have to applaud the film makers for 'making a house out of soda cans' as one reviewer wrote.  The film basically made its own history, and I know I was convinced.",10,1,2,4 August 1999
10 Things I Hate About You," A nice happy feel-good movie.
",After seeing the movie I wanted to go and read 'The Taming of the Shrew.' You walk away from the movie with a good feeling inside.  I recommend this movie to people who like romantic comedies.,10,1,1,20 April 1999
American History X," Edward Norton deserved the Oscar.
","This was a gripping movie.  Edward Norton did a flawless job acting.  This movie was not meant to glorify racism,but to show the struggles of being under controversy.  The black and white usage in the movie was a great way to show the flashbacks.  Definitely one of the top movies in 1998.",10,0,0,20 April 1999
