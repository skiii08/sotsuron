Hereditary," I had higher hopes
","I was so excited to watch this movie, because i love Ari Aster so much. (Midsommar is one of my favourite films this year). However, i didn't particularly enjoy this film. Don't get me wrong, the acting and direction was great. But I did expect more. I may have to rewatch and see if that changes my mind.",5,1,4,7 September 2019
