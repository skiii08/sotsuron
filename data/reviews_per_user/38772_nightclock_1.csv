Hereditary," Best horror movie of all time
","I love horror films and this is now my favourite one of all time. Everything in this film is perfect, the acting, the story, and the directing. This may not be for mainstream viewers who enjoy films like transformers and fast and the furious but for people who like well directed horror films you will not be disappointed. 10/10",10,1,2,29 July 2018
