It," Abysmal
","I can't believe this movie's receiving so much attention and positive reviews. I watched the movie, and the opening was humorous enough to make me burst in to laugh. This movie is nowhere near scary, even for a teenager. Apart from the mediocre cast, everything is horrendous including the CGI, cinematography, directing, and the worst of them all, sound effects. It reminded me of children's animations like Tom and Jerry, making jolly noises hitting each other with baseball bats. Furthermore, IT does not deserve to be on screens, let alone receiving so much publicity. I've been in IMDb for almost 10 years, however, I rarely write any reviews. Nevertheless, this movie was so awful that it obliged me to write this review and warn other people to think twice before wasting their precious time on a movie which is not horror neither is it worth watching.",1,4,10,6 October 2017
The Hateful Eight," Pretty good movie
","This is my first review in almost 7years of using IMDb. I'm really surprised by all the bad reviews people are giving this movie.What's not to like? Simple and fluid plot, good acting, good directing and usual Tarantino visual effects and maybe mediocre cinematography. If you're hating the movie, you should go watch something like avengers. I'm not saying Avengers is a bad movie, but you know what I'm talking about... It's a good movie indeed, if you're a Tarantino fan, you should watch it. If you like movies that happen mostly on a stage, you should also watch it. If you expect to see a western/action movie, this movie is not right for you.",9,12,26,27 January 2016
