Scarface," Scarface
","I'm sure you've heard this from loads of people already but scarface is without a single doubt the best film imaginable. The acting, directing, storyline and realism are just unbeatable. This film only gets a 10 from me for 1 reason... i cant vote higher. Al Pacino puts out a remarkable performance as Tony Montana and this film is a must have in all collections. If you have not seen this film i advise you do so as soon as possible and i promise you will not be left unsatisfied. This was the film that without a doubt put Al Pacino on the map to being the best actor in the world. Its a classic that will be remembered for its greatness, ruthlessness and above all desire to be top dogDanny Stott.",10,0,1,23 December 2004
