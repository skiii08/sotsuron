The Ring," Embarrassing and washed out
","I was lucky to watch the original movie 'Ringu' before I decided to watch this. After hearing lots of good comments about this movie, I thought it was worth a shot, and I really did give it a chance.Assuming that everyone hasn't seen the real movie Ringu, I have to point out the great difference that makes the original film a great horror flick, and this movie nothing but another American mistake.Ringu is a disturbing movie with gritty images, a dark documentary feel and almost realistic effects.The Ring is a well lit American movie, starring your regular American actors, interfering every scary moment with ugly special effects and stripping down the dark mysterious movie to another bland American remake. I can only rate this movie for what has been made, and thats just re-shooting a good movie and earning money in the process. Nothing new was added, except some pointless new scenes that had nothing to do with the original film. If you're planning on watching this movie, see the original first, so you can decide whether or not you want to spend one and a half hour feeling embarrassed watching a poor attempt of improvement.",3,1,2,23 January 2006
