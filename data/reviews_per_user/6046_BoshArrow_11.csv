Ford v Ferrari," Give this man an Oscar!
","I had huge expectations for 'Ford v Ferrari' and the movie didn't disappoint at all! Amazing Christian Bale - he is again doing perfect job portraying a very interesting character. Life and work of racing drivers are usually really complicated and every big champion needs to tackle different issues in their private or professional life. The movie managed to tell us a complete and heartbreaking story that involved conflicts on different levels. Miles (Christian Bale) and Shelby (Matt Damon) against the interests of Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas), Ford vs Ferrari, the expectations of Henry Ford II, the feeling of being a great racing driver but also a great role model for your son. Honestly, Bale deserves an Oscar for this performance and I am really looking forward to the Oscars next year, because 2019 offered some of the best movies in the history of cinema.",10,1,2,24 November 2019
Captain Marvel," Awesome action, marvellous Brie Larson
","I just can't understand the hate towards this nice movie. Yes, it's far from Infinity War, but I feel it's still among top 10 in the MCU. Brie Larson is gorgeus, she did her best and I believe she will fit perfectly in the upcoming movies.
Action scenes on highest level, interesting plot and touching score - Marvel soundtracks continually improve and I think this one is great as well.
'Captain Marvel' is maybe the first movie in which you can actually see more from Nick Fury and understand his vital role for the MCU. Samuel L. Jackson does a decent job and he has a strong supporting role.
Well, I have to say something about the villains in this film - just expect something similar to what happened in 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2'.Nice plot twists, interesting investigation and awesome final fight. Don't expect a punching contest like in 'Civil War' or a clever solution like in 'Doctor Strange' - the final battle could be compared to a marvellous inspiration like in 'Guardians of the Galaxy'. The bad guys were actually very interesting and delivered entertainment.
I think 9/10 is fair, 'Captain Marvel' is way better than 'Thor: The Dark World' or 'Ant-man'.",9,5,13,8 March 2019
Knives Out," Kicking off 2020 with a brilliant crime comedy
","It's fun to watch, it is highly entertaining, it has great cast that delivered amazing performances - 'Knives Out' is a mystery you wouldn't miss. Chris Evans does very well in this movie and his character Ransom brings more drama, funny situations and some memorable lines. I didn't really expect the ending to be so highly entertaining, but the storyline managed to keep me on the edge of my seat. I totally recommend this movie, it's awesome!",10,2,6,16 January 2020
Deadpool 2," Deadpool 2 - a nice superhero parody
","The Terminator, James Bond, Thanos, Batman, Wolverine - you can find so many legendary characters in Deadpool 2. The movie is a huge parody, I had good experience during these two hours. I didn't laugh that much, some of the jokes were very stupid, but there are several characters who saved the day. Domino, Peter and the Vanisher were the fresh and funniest new characters in the movie - I wanted to see more from the X-Force in Deadpool 2. In addition, I needed to see more from Colossus, whose connection to Deadpool is so special for both movies. I didn't like how Cable was introduced and he was just one of the many in the mix. The beginning was so slow and the plot didn't really need Cable. That's why I think Colossus could have been the second main character in a movie with a different villain. The soundtrack wasn't special and the effects weren't good enough. I think 6/10 is fair!",6,0,2,22 May 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," The best part of this movie was the Imperial March during the credits!
","42 years amazing history, the greatest saga that inspired generations! I grew up with the Skywalker's story and I had big expectations for this ending. It turned out to be VERY BAD! These 2h. 21 min. were really embarassing and I felt betrayed from these terrible film-makers who were in it only for the money. I would like to share my experience and thoughts during these 2h and give some suggestions for a better story.I wish to begin with the positive aspects of 'The Rise of Skywalker', because it's no secret that the cast is absolutely amazing: Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley were both brilliant in this trilogy and they have no fault for the problems with story and directing. Overall, Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill, John Williams, Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver really managed to save these few movies and I would rate positively the 2015 - 2019 period because of them. Seeing again Lando Calrissian in a Star Wars movie is always a win, while the visual effects and the sound editing were best quality.Unfortunately, I am giving this movie 3/10 and there are several reasons for that.
1) LACK OF LOGIC AND CONSISTENCY
You need to watch your previous movies and work with what you have already established - it's clear the director really decided to leave everything that was created during 'The Force Awakens'. Snoke, Knights of Ren, General Hux, Maz Kanata, Captain Phasma, DJ - so many characters that needed development, but the fans got only more from Palpatine...
What was the point of creating Snoke and the Knights of Ren? It seemed they were a big deal and I had huge expectations for them before 'The Last Jedi' - Snoke was killed (which I really accepted and thought it might be very interesting to see Kylo Ren as the main villain), while the Knights of Ren were there only for the cool camera shots and the final small battle with Ben. General Hux was an important character, although at some point he looked ridiculous, but his death was another sign for the lazy writing in this movie. 'The Rise of Skywalker' abandened all the characters from the previous movies (The Force Awakens, The Last Jedi) and decided to focus on Palpatine...AGAIN.
2) EMPEROR PALPATINE
He was a character that didn't need to be in this movie. Firstly, if you respect the ending of 'Return of the Jedi', you would never include the Emperor in this one, because there is no logic in it. I didn't like his contribution to the plot, it seemed the film-makers didn't have any clue on what to do with their characters and decided to revive him and even make him Rey's grandpa which is absolutely lame. Palpatine is selfish and cruel, it's not in his nature to have a child - when was this child even born and why wasn't his son mentioned in the previous movies? Anakin Skywalker was the chosen one and he destroyed the Sith, everything else just doesn't count.
3) Chris Terrio
The man that destroyed the DC Universe is now demolishing Star Wars. I have already watched Batman vs Superman and Justice League - both movies had terrible screenplay and this led DC to great crisis. I saw that Terrio is about to be responsible for the next Justice League instalment - I have a feeling I am going to miss this experience.
4) 'The Rise of Skywalker' would have been much better, if it was more focused on Kylo Ren and his Knights of Ren. A final showdown between Rey and Kylo together with his Knights could have made this movie awesome. Kylo was a perfect villain and his relationship with Rey was very positive for these 3 movies. A change in the approach towards General Hux might have also made this film good to watch - he was dangerous and ambitious and that could have led to a promising climax against Finn and Poe.Overall, it is sad that the Skywalker saga finishes like that, but all 9 movies are entertaining and I would watch them anywhere and anytime. This one was bad, but don't worry, there is still much to come!",3,27,45,22 December 2019
The Favourite," Too many sins
","Yesterday I had the chance to watch the extraordinary movie 'The Favourite' and I wish to share my feelings related to it.
Firstly, I have no idea why this movie was even nominated for 'Best Picture' - after spending so much money in the theater I was expecting to see something creative and interesting with my friends, but I just fell asleep after 20 minutes. 'The Favourite' is just boring - boring plot, predictable characters, annoying score. The soundtrack of this movie was supposed to be stylish and touching but I can compare it to a loud noise which gave me only frustration.
7.7,7,8/10 - I just can't believe you gave this high score to a such tasteless movie. It was a weird experience - the constant repetitions of the word 'c***' and the puking scenes were extremely unpleasant. There was just no development and the end of the film can be described as ridiculous.
I still have to say some good words about this movie, because I saw something positive in it. Emma Stone is once again great during these 2 hours and she is in a league of her own - Olivia Colman and Rachel Weisz are not on her level, although it seemed they tried hard. The huge surprise from me was Nicholas Hoult whose supporting role is on a really high level - I see in his face a new Hugh Grant (17 years after 'About a boy') and expect to see him in more movies in the future.
'The Favourite' has too many sins and I can surely say it didn't deserve so many Oscar nominations. I would probably give an Oscar to Emma Stone, but the other nominations are ridiculous.",3,0,3,28 February 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," Finally, the wait is over!!! Epic movie!
","I have just watched 'Avengers: Infinity War' and I feel inspired - the wait is over! Amazing characters, epic action scenes, you will laugh, but you will also cry. It was great to see my favourite Guardians of the Galaxy together with the Avengers - 'I am Groot' followed by 'I am Steve Rogers'. Thanos is surely the best Marvel villain - so powerful and emotional. He begins the whole action with a short fight with Hulk - I think this is a good introduction and all people can easily understand how strong he actually is. The fans lose Heimdall and the iconic Loki - the death of our favourite villain was so tragic especially after his great line ('We have a Hulk!'). The film is surely well developed and people can follow different stories - Thor, Tony Stark and Peter Quill lead the storyline. I expected more from Captain Rogers, Black Panther and Bruce Banner, but they seemed to be only supporting characters. Parker and Strange did great job together with Iron-Man, while the Guardians were having hard time against Thanos on Knowhere. I love the relationship between Gamora and Star-Lord and their scene against Thanos was one of the best in the movie - sad, strong, great. Gamora has to be back in the next movie, I really need her in this situation. The battle on Titan was the best in the whole MCU - they were so close!!! The battle in Wakanda was good, but the fight between Iron-Man and Thanos was on the highest level. You need to watch this movie, I am planning to do this once again!",10,1,3,27 April 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Are you OK? Is everyone OK? Boring disappointment with a shocking ending!
","This year so far I believed the two main contenders for Best Picture during the Oscars would be 'Once Upon a Time ...in Hollywood' and 'Ford v Ferrari'. Well, I was wrong and even think that 'Avengers: Endgame' has bigger chance of winning the award than this Hollywood drama/'comedy'. I mean, there was no comedy in it, the first two hours didn't have any content at all...I watched 'Pulp Fiction' two days ago and my expectations for this one were really high, because Quentin Tarantino usually delivers top movies. I was really hoping to see a masterpiece, but I left the theatre with frustration and anger for the wasted time. I saw Leonardo DiCaprio's character whining for 2 hours, Margot Robbie's Sharon Tate didn't have any contribution to the plot, her main scenes were part of the brilliant trailer that made me watch this movie. I feel they were both wasted in this one - Margot Robbie is an incredible actress and might be the best in Hollywood right now, while Leo DiCaprio is a top performer for more than 20 years. I didn't enjoy their characters as much as I enjoyed Vince Vega or Butch Coolidge.The character that I found quite interesting was actually Cliff Booth and Brad Pitt might be the only person in this movie with an Oscar worthy performance. His acting was extremely good in this one and I think his three main scenes were fascinating: the one against Bruce Lee, the one in Spanh Ranch and the ending one which I would also describe as shocking.To sum up, 'Once Upon a Time ...in Hollywood' is not a masterpiece, but its musical score and some single acting performances saved its rating. When you hear 'Are you OK?'/ 'Is everyone OK? more than 3 times at the end of the movie, then you will be frustrated and it's not funny...",5,1,2,18 August 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Great film, great action!
","I have just watched Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi and I would like to share my thoughts related to the film. 
First of all, I think this is THE MOVIE of the YEAR - amazing scenes, interesting plot and well-developed main characters. Adam Driver/Kylo Ren steals the show with this great performance - his character is so unique and you can't correctly foresee his actions. I love Darth Vader, but I think Kylo can be even better than him in the next movie. The relationship between Kylo and Rey is also well-developed and their connection is something new in the whole Star Wars saga. 10/10 for Ben Solo and Rey from me!
Although there were some ridiculous scenes and characters (General Hux), I think you must watch this movie! I know that most of the fans expected more from Luke and Snoke, but their role in the movie was quite good. The soundtrack is once again out of this world!
Overall, this is the best film of 2017!",10,7,23,17 December 2017
Joker," 'What is wrong with all you people?': 'Joker' is an unbelievable dark and conflicting movie
","Well, it is usually very hard to say anything after something so disturbing as this movie, but 'Joker' was thought-provoking, intense and extremely powerful, it was something unseen for the last 10 years. Comedy, tragedy, imaginary love story, pain, violence, conflicts - it looked so real and this usually makes one movie a masterpiece. I mean, Arthur was a man having lots of conflicts and involved in different contexts with different characters. He was simultaneously the villain and the hero, most of his actions were absolutely horrible, but they actually made sense in these contexts. His final confrontation against Murray was one of the best scenes I have ever experienced - his style, his movement, the way he talked...amazing. He could never win this fight against society, but let's face it: he is the one who makes sense and not Batman. Everybody wants to be the hero, defeat the bad guy, win the girl at the end and live happily ever after, but that's not always the case and it is definitely sad.'Joker' is the movie DC really needed - after I wasted my time with movies like 'Batman vs Superman' and 'Justice League' I really expected something different from them and they finally delivered a quality product. DC comics have 3 A-list characters: Batman, Superman and the Joker and people expect top movies with these guys. Aquaman, Wonder Woman and the Flash are there for the entertainment and they don't deliver high ratings or fans. Amazing choice to do this movie and great job by both Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix. They really managed to match the quality of 'Avengers: Endgame' and also outshine 'Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood' in the run for the Oscars. I am really looking forward to see Christian Bale and 'Ford v Ferrari', but right now Joaquin Phoenix is a big contender for 'Best Actor in a Leading Role'.",10,1,1,12 October 2019
Black Panther," Black Panther - weak opening, interesting final
","Black Panther is the 18. movie in the MCU and I expected to see a great story after the events in Captain America: Civil War. I am a bit disappointed with the film now and I think that it is one of the worst in the MCU.Firstly, I didn't see the great badass Black Panther from the previous movie - he was powerful, confident and inspiring in Civil War. In this film he was totally different character and I had the feeling that Killmonger entirely deserved his moral victory. Erik was an interesting villain, one of the best in the MCU - Michael B. Jordan did a good job in this film. I would also like to praise Martin Freeman and Daniel Kaluuya for their performance (I give this 7/10 mostly because of these two phenomenal actors). Overall, Black Panther is OK, but it is far behind Thor: Ragnarok, Guardians of the Galaxy (1 and 2) and Iron Man (1) in the MCU.",7,13,26,18 February 2018
