The New World," If this movie were any slower, it would just be a photograph.
","To sum up this movie:30% of it, is badly scripted voice-over monologues. 15% random shots of nature. over and over again. 10% close-ups of peoples bodies. 5% badly choreographed fight scenes. 5% unintelligible babbling. 10% of it I didn't pay much attention to because I may have been asleep, but its OK because they were still showing the same thing when I woke up.I hope this isn't considered a spoiler, because while I haven't given away the so-called plot, I think I have just about covered the whole movie. Its just the same stuff repeated over and over, in a random and disconnected fashion, drilling it into you like the director is insulting your intelligence. And the whole way through there is a seemingly looped sample of an orchestra tuning up. A movie is supposed to be an experience, but my word, this one made me feel like I was in jail.",1,2,9,19 February 2006
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Main plot suffers thanks to time constraints
","Being tasked with creating Harry Potter 4 cannot be easy. One has to out-do movies 1, 2 and 3 just to meet public expectation. Many of the scenes that work well in the book simply can't be filmed - a lot of book 4 was the thoughts running through Harry's head - and you can't suddenly add voice overs to a sequel when the last 3 movies didn't have them. In these respects, the way the film was adapted from the book was excellent. Other highlights for me were the underwater scene and the dragon chase.Thats about where it ends though. I did not like the new Dumbledore - I don't think this actor has even read the book or he'd realize that Dumbledore is a quiet, humble, respected man who doesn't have to shout or push people around to get things done. He also looks more like a recovering alcoholic than a kind lovable old man.The cinematography also sucked. Too many close-up shots with blurred backgrounds. This is cheating - the previous movies always had interesting, often humorous magic stuff going on behind the characters, adding depth and the ability to watch the movie a second time and still notice new things. This one was filmed like some kind of low-budget adult drama. The score lacked depth and did nothing for me either.And lastly, I can understand that there was a lot to get into a 2.5 hour film and they had to drop certain sub-plots, but I really felt the movie was too rushed, the main plot was squeezed to its bare minimum at the expense of scenes like the Yule Ball, which could've probably been cut out along with the others to allow more time to develop the characters and story (so that it makes sense to people who haven't read the book) and to add back in that touch of humor which makes the potter books so much fun to read.",6,0,0,1 December 2005
Stranger Than Fiction," Good acting let down by a weak script
","I think this movie is generally overrated. Sure, the general plot was intriguing, Will Ferrell proved he can act, and the characters were all developed nicely. But the script was an insult to the average moviegoers IQ. The story within the story really could not have been as exciting as we're forced to believe. Then there was only one vaguely memorable joke (the 'flowers') which, as with most other lines in this movie, was repeated a few times as if we're incapable of hearing it the first time. Then the end - without spoiling it - was just not believable. There was so much more that could've been done with the idea, but unfortunately Stranger than Fiction comes across as a contrived, forgettable first draft at what should've been brilliant.",6,2,4,13 January 2007
Sin City," Maybe you have to be a comic book fan...
","I have never read a comic book in my life, let alone the Sin City ones. Which is probably why I thought this highly-regarded film was actually a load of nonsense (- apart from the outstanding cinematography, which is mind-blowing, and clearly took a lot of effort to pull off flawlessly.) Rated purely from an entertainment point of view, I have to say the plot - or plots rather - are weak and badly scripted, most of the characters have no depth at all (with the exception of Willis & Alba), and I spent the whole movie waiting for a climax or twist that brought together all the plots, but there wasn't one. It just ended, after a lot of senseless violence. 4/10, plus another 2 for the cinematography and Jessica Alba, who is the hottest woman on earth.",6,3,6,11 October 2005
The Island," A good prediction of our future...
","The concept of this movie is one of the best, most original ideas I've seen in a film in ages, and reminded me of Gattaca in the sense that with the way science is going, it may be a very good preview of our future. Unfortunately, they gave the idea away during the making-of/trailer I saw a few nights before the movie came out. That was the first mistake - it would've been better had this come as a surprise. The second mistake was adding in half an hour of unnecessary running around mission-impossible style, which made the film less believable because they just seemed to survive one impossible situation after the next.Otherwise, the movie has a hot cast with some great acting, and a lot of research and creativity clearly went into the making of this film. Highly recommended providing you go to the toilet just before the film. 9/10",9,0,0,13 October 2005
