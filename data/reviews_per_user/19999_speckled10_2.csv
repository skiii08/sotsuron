Vertigo," Absolutely amazing
","Despite being in my late 20's and an movie-fan, this is my very first time seeing Vertigo thanks to the joys of DVD, in what is a bit of a Hitchcock discovery phase for me.I saw Rear Window for the first time also a week ago and was impressed but not blown away.. but oh what a different story for this one!!* SPOILER SPACE *Absolutely breathtaking, mesmerising, engrossing, all of those things - and incredible visuals for 1958!! I can only imagine what people must have thought in the cinema at the time.I guess for anyone who feels the movie is too long and slow and didn't enjoy just didn't get captivated by the tragic romance nor could identify so many feelings in each character. Kim Novak was the mesmerising aspect of this role - totally believable in all her guises, amazing performance.
I didn't think Jimmy Stewart was the perfect kind of person to play the lead role - perhaps too old or too staid, excelling as the likeable everyman but lacking in real open-hearted emotion as is his typical chararcter. But I must say perhaps it's because we are used to this that the film packs an extra emotional punch.I'm still at odd's over the ending. It is so abrupt - why does she react so suddenly to the appearance of the Nun, becuase of the ghostly shilouette. What about the Nun's incredible aloof reaction! Something just doesn't seem fair about this movie, but maybe that is the whole point. Love like this is never fair.I could go on and on but believe me the rumors are true - this is one heck of a movie - not your typical Hitchcock movie and just a brilliant piece of filmaking that stands the test of time..10/10",10,5,7,2 April 2003
Back to the Future," Still stands up!!
","Just got to view the great DVD 3-pack release and I am amazed (as is mentioned on a featurette) how well all 3 movies still stand up.
Unlike so many movies from the mid-80's, the story is timeless, there is not too much emphasis on fads at the time, the fashions etc are all very low key.. which in hindsight is a bit of genius considering it may have been tempting to show the 80's characters in the wild fashions of the time to contrast with the 50's look.. And the future view also still stands up as being modern! Although, ahem, flying cars by 2015? Doesn't seem so realistic now :) Anyway.. love them all.. the 2nd has that great futuristic look and re-recreates the scenes from the original movie brilliantly! And though originally I didn't like the idea of the 3rd movie being entirely set in the west. I must say now of the three it's probably the most beautifully shot with the warmest story..",9,0,1,1 January 2003
