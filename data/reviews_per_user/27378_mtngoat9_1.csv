Requiem for a Dream," Great movie
","Wonderful film.Ellen Burstyn turns in a power performance as the Brooklyn grandma across the hall.... a lonely woman with an addict son, who is going slowly psychotic from the diet pills she's popping after a phone scam convinces her she's going to be on Television. That's how she says it, capital T, Television. When she's not worried about her increasingly aggressive refrigerator, that is. Four people set the cruise for hell, on direct descent. Well worth watching, ironic, sad, and clever. I'd never heard of it, now I am not shocked to find it at #54 on the all time 250. 'Traffic' goes out for a 'Naked Lunch'. You'll know what I mean.",10,0,1,26 October 2004
