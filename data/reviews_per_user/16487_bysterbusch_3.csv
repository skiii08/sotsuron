First Man," Nothing to See Here
","My wife and I are going to visit Houston this year and were interested in history about NASA. This is not the movie for history, it's about a man's struggle with the loss of a child and probably PTSD. Should have been closer to 90 minutes than nearly 2.5 hours. Quite disappointing.",2,1,3,3 March 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," It Could Have Been Worse
",Tarantino got me to watch another of his movies. When will I learn.,3,3,13,28 March 2020
1917," Visually Great, but That's All
","Don't believe the hype. 15-20 minutes of story with 1.5 hours of fluff. The continuous scene aspect of the movie was done well but obvious use of CGI and green screen technology detracted from it. Additionally, there is a distinct lack of female characters, which is contrary to today's progressive thinking.",5,3,7,18 April 2020
