Ford v Ferrari," For a Film About Speed, This Was a Snoozefest
","'Ford v Ferrari' is a film about speed. And yet somehow, the filmmakers seem clueless about pacing and holding an audience's attention. With a run time of 2 hours and 32 minutes, the film seemed interminable due to the long, padded scenes stuffed between the race car sequences.The main problem with the film was in the character developments, which were one-dimensional and lifeless. A chorus of executives at the Ford Motor Company were an indistinguishable set of cookie-cutters. Incredibly, the visionary Lee Iococca blended in with the others, and it was never explained to viewers the genius of Iococca in the development of one of Ford's all-time best products, the Mustang. The one-note authoritarian dimension of Henry Ford II wore thin after his first scene, where he berates assembly line works and dismisses them for the day.The two principal race car drivers were also a sorry lot. Matt Damon dials in his performance of Carroll Shelby, a washed-up driver with a bum sticker, who is the liaison between the Ford executives and the world of the speedway. Christian Bale plays the role of driver Ken Miles as a down-on-his-luck schlub with an attitude. The maudlin scenes between Miles and his kid were a pathetic showcase of parenting, wherein the values taught to the little boy are that being a reckless hothead in life somehow pays off.The sappy dialogue of Miles and his long-suffering wife and the smarmy banter of the Ford executives bog the film down. Even the racing scenes were not as good as those crafted for 'The Art of Racing in the Rain.' From start to finish, 'Ford v Ferrari' is a snoozefest and one of the most overrated films of 2019.",Null,4,6,5 March 2020
Angels & Demons," 10 Reasons Why This Film Took a Belly Flop in the Tiber River
","It is difficult to imagine how the engaging Dan Brown novel 'Angels and Demons' could misfire as badly as this film version. Here are ten reasons why the film was a failure. Due to the spoilers, please do no read on unless you have already seen the film.(1) In the film, there was no love relationship between Robert Langdon and Vittoria Vetra. Worse still, there was not even any chemistry between the two leading actors. (2) The breathtaking locations in Rome, as described in the novel, were not realized visually in the film. I am aware that director Ron Howard encountered difficulties in filming on location. But there are superior photographed depictions of Rome on The History Channel than in this film where the Eternal City was presented in eternal stock film footage. The great art works described in the novel were only briefly depicted in the film. The magnificent Bernini sculpture of the 'Ecstasy of St. Teresa' was only momentarily glimpsed, and the West Ponente relief in Vatican Square was not visible at all.(3) The most tasteless choice made by the film-maker was in the depiction of the deceased pope who actually resembled the beloved John Paul II. In the novel, the pope is clearly fictional with no resemblance to any real pope.(4) One of the most colorful (and important) characters of the novel, Maximilian Kohler, Director of CERN, was cut out of the screenplay.(5) There were numerous instances when the lines of dialog were inaudible due to extraneous background noise.(6) There were moments when the faces of characters were not visible due to the shadows and chiaroscuro film lighting. This technique worked in 'The Godfather' films, but Ron Howard is no Gordon Willis.(7) The College of Cardinals was quite a motley crew with one of the electors speaking in a Southern drawl. This dude would have been more at home on a Texas ranch than in the Sistine Chapel.(8) The crucial relationship of the Camerlengo and the deceased Pope was not defined in the film. This relationship was central to the theme of science vs. religion and the relevance of the Illuminati to the plot against the church.(9) In the novel, the character of Hassassin was an unforgettable villain. In the film, that assassin character's role was a cardboard cutout villain. (10) As a whole, the filmmakers did not trust the workings of the successful novel.In the novel, Langdon makes an impossible fall out of the sky and into the Tiber River. In Ron Howard's film, it was the movie itself that landed in the Tiber.",Null,156,229,12 June 2009
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," The Island of Misfit Toys
","The setting is Pittsburgh. The time is around the millennium. Young Charlie Kelmeckis is entering high school not with a chip on his shoulder but with a hole in his soul. But rather than explore the vacuum in his life, the film veers away from the realities faced by Charlie into a ridiculous coming-of-age story ridden with clichés.Time and again, credibility is lost with an attractive group of students that bond unconvincingly as outsiders. They call themselves 'the island of misfit toys.' But they are all so intelligent, dynamic, and smartly dressed that they never fit the profile of genuine outsiders, let alone the concept of the wallflower of the film's title.The crucial background in Charlie's past is only hinted at until the truth is revealed at the very end of the film. Growing up, the little boy had a special bond with his Auntie Helen. But one winter's night as she was driving home after a visit with her precious nephew, Auntie Helen was not concentrating on her driving, and she was clocked by a truck bearing down on her from the left. In the unformed mind of seven-year-old Charlie, he felt like he was the cause of his auntie's fatal accident. But is there more to the story? Indeed there is! Charlie and Auntie Helen had their 'own little secret.'Too many of the scenes in this film did not ring true to life. Would Charlie really be able to take on a foursome of football players in the school cafeteria? Would a senior as gorgeous as Sam really take an interest in a withdrawn freshman like Charlie? Would young Charlie even be invited and would he even be interested in attending the parties thrown by upperclassmen that he loathes? Would Charlie's English teacher really hand him a copy of his favorite book, which turns out to be J. D. Salinger's 'The Catcher in the Rye'? Please!!!The pacing of the film was laboriously slow with far too many subplots, miscellaneous characters, and under-developed relationships. Do we truly care about the relationship of Charlie's sister Candace with the abusive kid named 'Ponytail'? Does it ring true that Mary Elizabeth is a Buddhist, yet she yearns to live in a high-priced home on Cape Cod? Does it matter that the 'Goth' Alice shoplifts her jeans from the mall? The dialogue rarely rang true, and the major shortcoming was that the characters were simply not very likable.",Null,3,4,25 November 2019
The Equalizer," Why Were You Born, Bob McCall?
","'The Equalizer' opens with a Mark Twain quote that gets to the heart of the mystery of the protagonist Robert McCall: 'The two most important days in your life are the day you born and the day you find out why.' In the course of the film we find out the answer to Mr. McCall's purpose in life, namely, to serve as a modern day Robin Hood and balance things about between good and evil in the world.The film developed a compelling narrative with the ex-CIA black ops specialist McCall who has left his past behind and assumed a mild-mannered role as a Home Mart employee and an avid reader of the classics. Following the death of his beloved wife Vivian, McCall has taken to reading the most famous 100 books. He is seen reading Hemingway's 'The Old Man and the Sea' and Ralph Ellison's 'Invisible Man.' But the most relevant is the one is the novel he only briefly describes to Alina as a story of a medieval knight errant fighting for the causes of good in the world. Of course, that novel is Cervantes 'Don Quixote.' Robert McCall is a much more effective redeemer and revenger than Don Quixote. He takes on the Russian mafia that has infiltrated the East Coast, enlisting corrupt Boston policemen and American politicians, and engages in human trafficking, money laundering, and other criminal activities.The best line in the film occurs at the lavish estate of one of Mr. McCall's old CIA colleagues. When McCall pays a visit to her, the CIA official casually informs her husband, 'He didn't come for help; he came for permission.' The 'permission' granted to him is to become a one-man wrecking crew of the nefarious Nicolai Itchenko and his associates, plus the Russian based ringleader, Vladimir Pushkin.'The Equalizer' was well-directed with stunning location footage of sites in Boston, outstanding work with camera angles, and effective pacing for a longish film. One of the best scenes is a quiet conversation in a restaurant where Mr. McCall nearly teases out of his adversary Nicolai Itchenkoa confession that Nicolai was the boy who killed his kind benefactors after adopting him and giving him a loving environment. Nicolai Itchenko obviously found out who he was early in life, but refused to change. By contrast, Robert McCall recognized many ways that he could fulfill his destiny, then shape-shifted his way to a sense of service to humanity. One path was working in black ops; one was working as the Equalizer; but another was in the simple act of lending a helping hand to those in need like Alina. The best part of the film was Denzel Washington's complex interpretation of this multi-layered role.",Null,0,1,3 July 2018
War Dogs," Shocking True Life Story
","Based on the Guy Lawson Rolling Stone article 'Arms and the Dudes,' the film 'War Dogs' tells the story of two young hustlers in Florida who maneuvered their way to lucrative government contracts for the sales of arms to the United States government for use in the wars in the Middle East.Efraim Diveroli and David Packouz were the two wheeler-dealers who negotiated a $300 deal for guns and bullets for the Afghan National Army worth approximately $300 million. Their unsavory and illegals deals included such outrageous acts of purchasing Chinese ammunition, then removing the bullets from the cases to give the appearance of legitimacy.Eventually, the two arms dealers were busted by the FBI, yet given amazingly lenient sentencing. Perhaps this was the reason that the filmmakers did not take the subject very seriously. As interpreted by Jonah Hill and Miles Teller, the relationship of Efraim and David is portrayed in a whimsical manner with David as excessively naive and the Efraim with a puckish charm.But despite any shortcomings, the film is an eye-opening experience about the troubling way in which the government used tax payers' dollars for unlimited munitions contracts. The fact there was limited oversight in the transactions in an extremely disturbing in allowing two sleazy amateurs to work the system for their financial benefit.",Null,0,0,28 December 2016
Hereditary," A Cursed and Possessed Family
","In the bonus track of the DVD of 'Hereditary,' the writer-director Ari Aster described the film as both a personal and a horror film experience. But he also indicated that his goal was for 'a family drama first.'Indeed, the strength of the film was in the painful dialogue among the family members, especially that of the mother Annie and her son Peter. Aster has an ability to write intense and biting dialogue that recalls the tragic implications of the work of Eugene O'Neill, especially his masterpiece 'Long Day's Journey Into Night.'On the other hand, the film falls apart in the transition from naturalistic sounding family fighting and the techniques of the horror film. Aster's favorite films that inspired him were 'Carrie' and 'The Thief, the Cook, the Wife, and Her Lover.' When the trajectory of the film moved out of the realistic and into the macabre, it actually lost its edge.The film begins with an obituary followed by a funeral, and the ending turns into a bizarre ritual that moved away from the personal family drama. The characters were well conceived with an especially intriguing secondary role in the complex figure of Joanie. But 'Hereditary' never truly shed shed light on a tortured family, as the filmmaker recycled techniques from standard horror films. By the end, viewers must ask themselves whether they genuinely cared about this tortured family.",Null,0,0,7 September 2018
Minority Report," Style Over Substance
","Based on the Philip K. Dick short story, 'Minority Report' is another effort by Steven Spielberg that offers a flashy style without penetrating the meaning of Dick's dystopian vision of the future.The cast is hardworking, including Tom Cruise in the lead role of John Adderton, who is the lead enforcer on a futuristic crime-stopping plan called Pre-Crime, which uses human guinea pigs to predict as 'precogs' to use their psychic powers to prevent murders in Washington, D.C. Indeed, the most memorable character in the film is Agatha, the brightest of the pods, as played by Samantha Morton. Colin Farrell is good as the cocky investigator.The plot is fairly by-the-numbers with a predictable villain and loads of sentiment. The fast-paced action scenes are over-the-top with special effects. The film is more successful with the quiet moments, especially the touching relationship of John and his estranged wife Lara, both of whom are grieving over the loss of their son.A troubling aspect of the film was how the three precogs were being exploited in the name of science. An essential question to raise about 'Minority Report' is whether the film truly challenges audiences to contemplate how violent crime might be prevented in the future...or whether this was just a run-of-the-mill action picture.",Null,0,0,27 August 2019
Detroit," Portrait of a War Zone
","'Detroit' seeks to reconstruct the July 25, 1967 murders in the Algiers Motel during the heart of the summer riots in Detroit. Because the facts of what happened in the motel were skewed during the show trial of three Detroit police officers, the filmmakers have attempted to interview eyewitnesses in order to reconstruct the sequence of events at the Algiers Motel. The film largely succeeds as a quasi documentary presented as a conventional Hollywood feature film.The film presents essential background about the Great Migration of the turn of the twentieth century in which as many as six million African-Americans moved to the northern industrial cities in search of work and the American Dream. But in Detroit of the post-World War II years, which was the fifth largest city in the nation, there was a mass exodus to the suburbs, primarily of the white middle class. The Detroit of 1967 was a highly segregated metropolis with a total African-American population of 40% and a police force that was 95% white. This was the backdrop for the riots in the boiling summer of 1967.From the historical and sociological perspectives, the trial scene was the most important in the film. In an outrageous miscarriage of justice, the three Detroit police officers were found not guilty of the murders of three men at the Algiers motel. It is mind-boggling to contemplate who the all-white jury members believe killed the victims? In one of the best lines in the script, the upshot of the trial is that 'police criminality needs to be treated the same as any other criminality.' After the passage of fifty years, the same question might be raised in the American court system in 2017.In its aesthetics and construction, 'Detroit' was not a perfect film. The close-ups and the hand-held camera eventually lost their impact due to over use. A number of the characters and situations were underdeveloped. For example, what were Julie Ann Hysell and her friend Karen doing in Detroit at the heart of the riots? Hysell even appears in one of the bonus segments of the DVD, yet does not fill us in on this basic exposition. One of the young women was apparently the daughter of an Ohio judge. Yet it was never clear what motivated them to visit the heart of Detroit in the summer of 1967. Another poorly constructed plot strand concerns the film's principal villain, the racist cop named Krauss. Early in the film, Krauss shoots and kills a man who was looting groceries. Krauss is called in to the office of his supervisor, Detective Tanchuck. The detective advises Krauss that he will be facing murder charges, but chooses not to suspend the officer, sending him right back on the streets to the vicinity of the Algiers Motel. The murder charges for the first killing are never raised again in the film. Did Tanchuck simply bury his report? The film never explains.1,100 National Guardsmen were called into Detroit in the summer of 1967, along with special combat units. Tanks were lined up and down 12th Street. The film is successful in conveying a major American city as a 'no-man's land.' Decent citizens like Melvin Dismukes were caught up the terror of racist cops in the City of Detroit. As indicated on one of the excellent bonus segments on the DVD, it was suggested that all police trainees today should view this film. And they should also follow the advice of a kind nurse in the hospital who offered good counsel to the visitors of one of the victims of the riots: 'Be gentle.'",Null,0,1,28 December 2017
A Star Is Born," Jackson Maine is a Pitiful Creature
","Of the four film versions of 'A Star is Born,' this Cooper-Gaga version is the bottom feeder. One notch above is the Streisand-Kristofferson film at #3. The #2 version is the March-Gaynor black-and-white film. And the sublime Judy Garland version wins the sweepstakes at #1. For this new version, problems abound in the acting, directing, and music.The film was not successful in the rise-and-fall structure built around the two singers. While Miss Gaga was successful in portraying the meteoric rise to stardom of Ally, the character of Jackson Maine essentially started at rock bottom and fell into greater depravity as the film progressed. This was a pitiful creature with no backbone, and his treatment of Ally was meaner than the Norman Maine in the three other film versions. In those films, the Norman Maine character is at least likeable, and the audience roots for him to overcome his alcoholism. In Bradley Cooper's interpretation of Maine, he never seemed to want to resolve his troubled relationship with his father. In his rehab treatment, he even fails to keep his journal and bring it to the support group.In the film's direction, Cooper's work was also substandard. The pacing of the film was uneven with too many slow stretches. There were occasional lapses in dialogue overlap and timing in delivery of lines. The camera work included too many close-ups and awkward compositional choices, often appearing like a made-for-television project, as opposed to a big-budget feature film.Above all, for a film musical, the score was not exciting and the songs tended to blend together in a single, limited musical style. Cooper was not convincing as a famous country-and-western star, and the music all too predictable. In the Judy Garland version, the songs evolved organically out of character interactions, such as delightful improvised number at home where Garland's character Vicky Lester sings to Norman about her day at the studio, using household objects as props for her routine. Even the Streisand-Kristofferson film had a decent score.All in all, this fourth version of 'A Star is Born' was a major disappointment. The sluggish pace, lackluster performances, and amateurish sound track all added up to a major flop. The Judy Garland version, as brilliantly directed by George Cukor, stands tall as one of the great film musicals ever produced.",Null,3,5,20 February 2019
Wind River," A Harrowing Experience
","In one of the deleted scenes from 'Wind River' that appear on the DVD version of the film, the FBI agent Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen) is at the check-in desk of a motel in the remote Wind River Indian Reservation in western Wyoming. The motel proprietor is not friendly and sympathetic when asked by the agent if there is a discount for government employees. 'The government has never given me a discount,' the owner wryly responds.It is unfortunate that the deleted scene was not included in the final film cut. The motel owner also informs SA Banner that young women of the Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho tribes have gone missing at alarming rates. It is not until the final screen credits that the audience learns more of this important backdrop.'Wild River' focuses on the disappearance and subsequent murder of a young Native American woman named Natalie, who is brutally assaulted and dies fleeing for her life while running in the snow. The protagonist named Cory Lambert (Jeremy Renner), is a local official of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, who hunts predators to protect the local herds of sheep and cattle. He now joins forces with FBI SA Banner in solving the crime.Cory's character is vital to film's dramatic action because his own daughter was abducted and murdered at a time when he had left her unchaperoned at home for a party. Things got out of hand, the daughter was killed, and the crime was never solved.A profound sense of melancholy hangs over the local residents of Wind River. This is most apparent with the arrival of the outsider, the FBA agent, who seems so out of place in this world. But SA Banner learns about the tragedy primarily from Cory, and she becomes more in tune with the tragic environment as the film develops. Another memorable character is Martin, the father of Natalie, who has also bonded with Cory in the shared experience of grief at the loss of a child.'Wild River' is a haunting film with a stunning climax in the major action sequence involving a volley of gunfire. In most action films, a shootout seems choreographed much like a video game. In this case, the scene unfolds spontaneously and with an ugly real-life quality that is unforgettable. This is not a pleasant film experience, but it is a thoughtful one that sensitizes us to important human realities. And, if one is checking in to the local motel at Wind River, it is especially important to be polite to the person working the front desk.",Null,2,5,23 November 2017
The Death of Stalin," Monty Python Meets Josef Vissarionovich Stalin
","In the bonus track of the DVD of 'The Death of Stalin,' there was a lengthy segment entitled 'Dictators, Murderers, and Comrades.' It was revealing that most of the interviews with the film artists focused on the serious implications about the death of Stalin and the power struggle that ensued in the Soviet Union in 1953.The question that remained unanswered was how exactly this subject could be turned into a biting satire. Monty Python was enormously successful in transforming serious topic into film satires. But the main issues that interested those behind-the-scenes in 'The Death of Stalin' were tragic in their implications. One of the main points was that when a leader dies in a totalitarian state, those remaining in control 'grapple for power, and it produces the worst in people.' An even more chilling theme is that 'a small group of men had the power of life and death over millions of people.'So, how did this film fare in turning into the comedy the coup that killed the notorious head of the NKVD security forces, Lavrenti Beria? How successful was the jockeying for power that led to the ouster of Stalin's protégé Malenkov and brought Nikita Khrushchev to power in generating belly laughs?The answer is that the satirical process was uneven. The first half of the film included some outrageous lines and antics. But by the midstream, the action became so violent and ugly that the laughs were replaced by raised-eyebrows.Another missed opportunity in the film was not to develop more completely the role of the concert pianist Maria Yudina (Olga Kurylenko). The role had great promise after Maria wrote the note to Stalin that apparently led to his fatal stroke. But Maria only appeared sporadically through the remainder of the film. This movie needed a spark that would transcend the infighting within a group of power-hungry old men. The role of the Maria Yudina could have provided a new dynamic to a film that never lived up to the work of Monty Python.",Null,0,1,21 June 2018
Darkest Hour," Horatius at the Gate
","One of Winston Churchill's favorite authors was Lord Macaulay, who wrote of the heroism of Horatius who held off the Etruscans from invading Rome, due to his heroism in guarding the bridge. 'Darkest Hour' portrays Churchill's similar actions in rallying Great Britain in his first month in office as Prime Minister in the dark days of May, 1940. The only difference between Churchill and the ancient Roman hero was that Churchill was using words in an act of patriotism in some of his greatest speeches.Some of the most interesting scenes in the film are those where Churchill is dictating his speeches to a typist, a fictional character named Miss Layton. Unknown to Churchill through most of the film, the secretary has lost her brother, who died while on the retreat to Dunkirk. It was Churchill's defiance of Hitler and his stand against the members of his war cabinet (especially Viscount Halifax and the disgraced Neville Chamberlain) that resulted in the successful evacuation of nearly 300,000 troops from Dunkirk.Churchill eloquently said that 'success is not final, failure is not fatal. It is the courage to control that counts.' Britain was truly alone in the dark days of 1940. Czechoslovakia, Poland, Denmark, and Norway had fallen to Hitler. Soon, Belgium and France would capitulate. No help was forthcoming from America. Churchill recognizes that England had to take control of her own destiny. When Churchill was appointed Prime Minister, he had a string of failures to his credit in the disastrous Gallipoli campaign of World War I, the paternalistic policy on India, his contrary stance on the Russian Civil War, the gold standard, the support of Edward VIII in his marriage to Wallis Simpson, and the Norway adventure. He was essentially cashiered as a politician and in the 'wilderness' throughout the 1930s. Yet, in May,1940, Churchill took center stage while admitting that he had 'nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears, and sweat.' One of the turning points in the film was when King George VI gave Churchill his unconditional support for resistance. There were to be no negotiations with Hitler. Viscount Halifax was correct when he acknowledged that when Churchill addressed Parliament in his famous 'fight on the beaches' speech, he had successfully 'mobilized the English language and sent it into battle.'",Null,0,4,3 March 2018
Amistad," The Indomitable Spirit of Human Freedom
","In 1839, a mutiny occurred on board the Cuban schooner La Amistad, wherein the slaves revolted against their Spanish captors, killed the captain and the cook and, for six weeks, attempted to sail back the home of their Mende tribe in the region of Sierra Leone in Africa. Instead, they landed off the coast of Long Island, were apprehended, and transported to New Haven where they were clapped in prison. With a screenplay written by David Franzoni, the Steven Spielberg directed film chronicles the trials of the 44 members of the Mende tribe that took place on American soil.Under President Martin van Buren and his Secretary of State John Forsyth, the government sought to uphold a treaty with young Isabella II of Spain and return the slaves to their owners. A group of American abolitionists raised funds for the defense of the Mende which argued that they were not human property, due to the ending of the slave trade. In a memorable moment in the film, former president John Quincy Adams (Anthony Hopkins) is approached by Mr. Judson (Morgan Freeman), who casually says that he has been 'reading in the papers about the Amistad.' Adams wryly asks, 'Real papers?' Indeed, before the Supreme Court, Adams introduces into evidence an issue from the organ of the Van Buren administration, 'The Executive Review,' that would be the rough equivalent of tweets in the twenty-first century. In the propaganda published by Van Buren's cronies, the newspaper was promoting the view that the natural state of humankind is slavery, to which Adams replies that there is an embarrassing, annoying document called the Declaration of Independence that stipulates that 'all men are created equal.'Even with one of Van Buren's appointees serving as judge, the lower court in New Haven ruled in favor of the Mende. When Van Buren pressed for an appeal before the Supreme Court, the bench was stacked with seven of the nine justices as slave-holding Southerners. But with only a single dissenting vote, the court upheld the lower court's verdict that the treaty with Spain is invalid. The foreign policy of Van Buren meant nothing to the court, which ruled that the Mende were not slaves, but free individuals with certain moral rights. The blowing up of the notorious Portuguese Lomboko Slave Fortress in Sierra Leone was an exclamation point to the court's verdict.The film indicates that Isabella of Spain continued to argue the Amistad matter in entreaties with seven more American presidents, most of whom were Southerners. Treaties and foreign policy were impotent before the two court findings. Her hopes finally collapsed with the defeat of the Confederate army in 1864. The hero of the film, Joseph CInque (Djimon Hounsou), returned to Sierra Leone to discover his people in the throes of civil war. His family members were gone, possibly sold into slavery. This powerful, moving, and well-photographed film is a testament to the indomitable spirit of human freedom.",Null,0,2,11 February 2018
Passengers," A Moral Dilemma in Outer Space
","In the bonus segment of the DVD version of 'Passengers,' we learn that the visual concept of the space ship Avalon was inspired by the Titanic. Both the outer and inner world of the Avalon have the look and feel of a luxury cruise ship. But the grand sets and special effects are not the most memorable part of 'Passengers,' a film that focuses on a fascinating ethical dilemma.Jennifer Lawrence as Aurora and Chris Pratt as Jim are two rather ordinary humans who have sought adventure in a futuristic world by undergoing a 100-year period of 'hibernation' aboard the spaceship Avalon en route to a new world. Jim wants to build a new home of the faraway planet; Aurora is a journalist who wants to return with a first-hand account of the adventure.The plan of these young people is disrupted when a meteor damages the spaceship resulting in the malfunction of the hibernation pod of Jim. When he is released from his capsule, he now must endure eighty years of travel to his new home. After a year of desperation and loneliness, he breaks open Aurora's pod in order to have a companion. The moral question that is raised in the film is whether or not he committed 'murder' by consciously opening the pod.One of most fascinating moments of the film is when a crew technician, whose pod has also malfunctioned, learns that Jim had tampered with another passenger's life. The reaction of Gus (Laurence Fishburne) is both priceless and humane.The fourth character in this drama is the robotic bartender played with deadpan British humor by Michael Sheen. It is remarkable that so much interest was sustained in a two-hour film by only four actors. In the end, the human drama, as opposed to the fancy sets, is what made 'Passengers' a special film.",Null,0,0,21 March 2017
Last Flag Flying," 'Humankind Cannot Bear Very Much Reality'
","In the bonus track of the DVD of 'Last Flag Flying,' the film's executive producer Thomas Lee Wright described the theme of 'the internal consequences of war' that the film artists sought to evoke. The film was successful in realizing that goal through three extraordinary character portraits.The most engaging part of the film was the banter among three characters, each of whom was meticulously developed by screenwriter-director Richard Linklater. Sal (Bryan Cranston), a wisecracking owner of a bar; Mueller (Laurence Fishburne), a reformed alcoholic turned pastor; and 'Doc' (Steve Carell) had such contrasting characters that film was constantly buoyed by friendly antagonism and one-upsmanship.The three characters, all of whom are Vietnam vets, meet in the year 2003, a time when the Iraq war is well under way. The film is a no-holds-barred critique of the two wars, which had an eerie resemblance to each other in the enormous investment of money cost in lives in faraway conflicts. Neither the Vietnam nor Iraqi wars were defensive in nature, but each one was started by America and evolved into a brutal quagmire. The strongest line in the film is when Sal berates a Marine colonel, telling him bluntly that if they had worked together in Vietnam, the result would have been 'fragging.' The word fragging means mutiny in which American soldiers refused to carry out orders and killed their commanding officers in Vietnam.The antiwar message is strengthened with a complementary philosophical perspective that is best expressed in the poet T. S. Eliot's famous line, 'Humankind cannot bear very much reality.' When the three veterans pay a visit to the mother of a Marine who died because of their horseplay, they plan to atone in a confessional to the mother. But they cannot bring themselves to tell the truth, instead choosing to lie to Mrs. Hightower in order to leave her and themselves with the sense that her son was a hero.The moving funeral of 'Doc's' son, who died senselessly in Iraq offers an exclamation point to the film's critique of the war and the prevarication of the government, when 'Doc' was mistakenly led to believe by the feckless colonel that the young man died in combat, when, in fact, he was the victim of an act of terrorism.The motto 'Semper fi' (always faithful) is a reference point for the ideal of dying for one's country that the film portrays as hollow and tragic for such needless wars as the ones in Vietnam and Iraq. This was a memorable and provocative film that raises many ethical questions about our nation's foreign policy both past and present. Great work from Fisburne, Carell, and Cranston!",Null,0,3,14 February 2018
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Splendid!
","With an appeal to both adults and children, the British author C. S. Lewis wrote seven books in his Chronicles of Narnia series. The stories are rich in mythology and religious symbolism, drawing upon archetypes from the Norse, Greco-Roman, Persian, medieval chivalric, and Judeo-Christian traditions.Now comes this wonderful film of the first chronicle, 'The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.' The beautiful cinematography and the terrific performances of the children make this film outstanding for family viewing. As integrated with the live actors, the colorful animal characters, especially the Lion (Jesus), reveal brilliant technical film-making as well.Lewis's books are not overtly allegorical. Rather, the symbols and the messages are subtle. The four children in the story (Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy) were inspired by the actual children evacuated from London during World War II, who spent time in Lewis's home. Lewis wanted his books to be enjoyed by young people who would later in their lives draw the spiritual meanings from the stories. In this area, the film is enormously faithful to the original book and would have made the author extremely proud.",Null,90,123,29 December 2005
The Notebook," My Favorite Scene was the One with the Geese, not the Gosling
","Prior to watching 'The Notebook,' I was not familiar with the work of the actress Rachel McAdams. She made an indelible impression by sustaining an outstanding performance in this film. Her character Allie is the pivotal role in the film, as she must make the crucial romantic decision on which the story turns. There are few performers capable of evolving the complexity of characterization as achieved by Rachel McAdams.The film recreated effectively the world of the 1940s in America, including the parental pressure exerted by the well-to-do family of Allie on whether to allow their daughter to pursue a young man from the other side of the tracks. As played by Ryan Gosling, the character of Noah could have revealed more emotional layers. There was only one scene in the film where he really showed that there was something at stake in his love for Allie. He apparently wrote her a passionate letter every day for a year. Especially in the film's early scenes, Gosling could have shown more of the passion.The other cast members were outstanding, including James Garner and Gena Rowlands in the parallel story. In the two plots, 'The Notebook' merits comparison with another outstanding romantic film, 'The Bridges of Madison County.' As the two subplots of 'The Notebook' come together, one of the key characters is Allie's mother. As always, Joan Allen delivers a convincing and complete character portrayal, as the well-intentioned, but conflicted mother. In one of the most moving scenes in the film, the mother opens up to the daughter and tells her story of youthful love and a fateful choice similar to the one Allie herself must face.My favorite scene in the film: a wonderful sequence where Noah and Allie are in a boat in the backwaters of South Carolina. The waterway is simply filled with white geese. It is a stunning and picturesque moment, among many in this well-crafted film. If there is such a spot in South Carolina, then I want to go there!",Null,172,253,18 June 2005
The Other Boleyn Girl," A Film Worth Seeing for the Issues of Gender
","The Other Boleyn Girl is a compelling film due to the exceptional performances and the splendid costumes. Additionally, there is simply a terrific story told about the relationship of Henry VIII and the two Boleyn sisters, Anne and Mary.Natalie Portman (Anne) and Scarlett Johansson (Mary) are outstanding as characters engaged in both sibling rivalry and sisterly bonding. In the central relationship of the sisters, the film develops the social roles and imposed limitations on women in Tudor England.One of the film's most moving character portrayals is the mother of the two Boleyn Sisters. In the heartbreaking performance of Kristin Scott Thomas, Elizabeth Boleyn can only watch helplessly as her daughters become pawns of the greedy men (Thomas Boleyn and the Duke of Norfolk), who use the young women much like pimps in order to line their pockets and further their own advancement at court. Another sterling aspect of the film is the portrayal of Katherine of Aragon (Ana Torent), another victim of the men due to the obsessive pursuit of Henry VIII to beget a male heir, leading to his momentous divorce from Katherine and England's break with the church of Rome.While commentators may point out the omissions of many of the details from the novel by Philippa Gregory, the film is still true to the spirit of the book. It is also a faithful representation of the role of women in Tudor age. The film effectively presents the gender issues from the perspective of many of the remarkable women of the age along with the reminder of the greatest legacy of Anne Boleyn, which was the indirect result of her relationship of Henry VIII. That legacy was the future ruler of England...and also a woman: Elizabeth I.",Null,119,178,1 March 2008
Us," Four Characters in Search of an Author
","In the bonus track of the DVD of 'Us,' writer-director Jordan Peele described his film as an actor's exercise, allowing each of the performers to play his or her double. He also described his main inspiration from the film 'Alien.' Unfortunately, the actor's exercise and the unimaginative incorporation of techniques from 'Alien' could not sustain interest in this film for two hours.The film's main premise had some potential in idea of the Doppelgänger that occurs in a family of four that is 'invaded' by their exact look-alikes from another dimension. The opening flashback was intriguing as a little girl gets lost in a subterranean world underneath an amusement in Santa Cruz called 'Find Yourself.'But once the 'creatures in red' began their invasion of the family home in Santa Cruz, the film became repetitive and overly violent. The so-called 'untethering' process of the creatures was never fully explained, and the film became no more that predictable, grade-B horror.There is a famous Italian play by Luigi Pirandello called 'Six Characters in Search of an Author' the combines bone-chilling elements of the supernatural with some substantial philosophical insights based on the same concept of the 'double' as apparent in 'Us.' But the film was a shallow exercise in style over substance.There was potential to explore the passage from the Bible when a man was standing on the Santa Cruz boardwalk holding up the sign 'Jeremiah 11:11': 'Therefore this is what the Lord says: 'I will bring on them a disaster they cannot escape. Although they cry out to me, I will not listen to them.' But there was no religious context explored other than the creatures in red who worship a god apparently named 'Tether.'Peele's previous success in 'Get Out' was due to the combination of the horror techniques and a strong social message. There was nothing special in 'Us,' was a set of variations on all of the familiar clichés of the horror genre.",Null,0,1,18 June 2019
The Danish Girl," Beautifully Photographed, Brilliantly Performed
","In the bonus segment of the DVD version of 'The Danish Girl,' the film artists discussed how the paintings of Vilhelm Hammershøi, a Danish artist of the early twentieth century, were the inspiration for many of the interior scenes of the film. Those stark scenes were successful in conveying the sense of loneliness that pervades the life of Lili, the central character, Lili Elbe.Because Lili and Gerda Wegener were both painters, the film offered a stylish approach to the environments that supported the main themes of the film. Additionally, the beautifully photographed exterior scenes added new layers to the feeling of isolation of the Lili and Gerda from each other.The casting of the film was superb with an excellent ensemble. But the two unforgettable performances were those of Alicia Vikander and Eddie Redmayne as Gerda and Lili. There was nothing artificial about their character portraits, as they probed deeply into the interior life of the characters to portray their souls.The hallmark of a great film is that it delivers a meaningful message and draws upon the artistry of the film medium. 'The Danish Girl' fulfills both of those criteria in a stellar way. Bravo!",Null,1,2,29 March 2016
The Girl Next Door," Sophomoric Comedy Includes Three Good Performances
","Two young performers (Emile Hirsch and Elisha Cuthbert) make this formulaic coming-of-age comedy worth watching. While the style of the film was screwball comedy, Hirsch and Cuthbert delivered effective naturalistic performances, avoiding the clichés of so many of the 'over-the-top' Hollywood farces geared to the teen audience. The early scenes of the film were especially touching in the innocence and sweetness captured by the two performers. It is there that the love relationship begins to develop and where both Hirsch and Cuthbert shine in their roles. Another good performance is by Timothy Olyphant as the sassy, smooth-talking con artist and film producer. The film as a whole is filled with stupid, juvenile scenes and antics, especially the trip to Las Vegas. But the three principal actors made the film enjoyable and even memorable.",Null,3,6,9 April 2005
Brokeback Mountain," A Modern-Day Tristan and Isolde?
","I watched 'Brokeback Mountain' after viewing the recently released film version of the tragic love story 'Tristan and Isolde.' In a curious way, the two films, stories, and characters seemed remarkably similar! In fact, 'Brokeback Mountain' included even more visual poetry than 'Tristan and Isolde,' which is one of the greatest love stories of all time.I never would have imagined poetry of any kind in the herding of sheep! But that is what director Ang Lee brilliantly provides in this breathtakingly beautiful film. Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal also deliver sensitive and completely believable performances as Ennis De Mar and Jack Twist, the young men who fatefully meet on Brokeback Mountain. One minor quibble: Despite fine performances by Michelle Williams (Alma) and Anne Hathaway (Lureen), the women's roles could have been developed more completely. For example, after watching her husband Ennis kissing Jack Twist on the mouth, would Alma not want to have a frank conversation about what she had witnessed? It was difficult to imagine that Alma would wait until after their divorce was finalized to finally confront her ex-husband about his relationship with Jack. After all, the setting for the film was the 1960s and 70s, a time when people were (finally) talking openly about matters of human sexuality.This film was still enormously successful in its lyricism and in its message about the power of love. Like Tristan and Isolde, the relationship of Ennis and Jack unfolded secretly and against the will of society. And what better backdrop for a romantic saga than the beautiful landscape of Wyoming, as masterfully filmed by Ang Lee.",Null,28,34,13 January 2006
Spotlight," 'On the Side of the Angels'
","In the DVD version of 'Spotlight,' there is a fascinating bonus segment where we meet the actual Boston Globe reporters whose groundbreaking story of pedophilia within the Catholic church is the subject of this film.It is not only interesting to learn more about these journalists, but also to hear their own accounts of their research into the case. At the close of the bonus clip, one of the reporters relates that he felt that their efforts were 'on the side of the angels' in raising awareness and bringing the truth to light for so many of the victims.As a film, 'Spotlight' is comparable to the journalistic thriller 'All the President's Men,' which tells the backstory of the two famous Washington Post reporters, Woodward and Bernstein, who broke the Watergate scandal in the 1970s. One of the strengths of 'Spotlight' is how the characters of the reporters are individualized. From Liev Shreiber's mild-mannered, soft-spoken editor to Mark Ruffalo's driven, hyperkinetic reporter to Rachel McAdams's thoughtful, intelligent character to Michael Keaton's quirky head of the Spotlight group, the characters were fully realized.It is especially Keaton's role of Robby Robinson that is integral to one of the film's most successful subplots: the incompetence and myopic work of the Boston Globe staff itself for failing to report the story when they essentially had all of the evidence in their possession for years. Without giving away the ending, it is Keaton's character who holds the key to this important strand of the film that deals with journalistic integrity.For acting, directing, and screen writing, 'Spotlight' is a remarkable collaborative effort. In viewing this film, one can only wonder how many other untold investigative stories never found their way to the light of the public. In one of the bonus segments, the film's director points out how journalism today is turning news into entertainment and that are not even reporters covering state legislatures today. The film focuses on the importance of journalism at the local level, which led to the successful efforts of the Boston Globe that discovered both the enormity of the child abuse cases, but the scope of the cover-up. This was an extremely thoughtful and provocative film that is deserving of the recognition it has received. This film truly merits its place in the spotlight.",Null,0,0,4 March 2016
Concussion," Excellent Biopic, If Only Too Long and Unfocused
","It is interesting to compare the two-hour PBS Frontline program 'League of Denial' with the feature film concussion. While both films spend considerable time in developing the story of Dr. Bennet Omalu, the Nigerian-American physician who studied the effects of concussions on NFL players, the two experiences offer different insights into a vital medical issue.The Frontline program was purely documentary, and the film 'Concussion' was clearly biographical. While brilliantly acted by Will Smith, the personal story of Dr. Omalu began to overshadow the dramatic narrative of how his research slowly came to be recognized by the medical community and the media The Frontline documentary offered a more scathing appraisal of the NFL, which used its powerful influence and financial resources to cover up the findings of Dr. Omalu. In 'Concussion,' there could have been a greater balance of the biography and the extraordinary story of the repression of a reality that was known for years, if not decades, within the community of the National Football League.Nonetheless, 'Concussion' was well-written and well-acted, and the prominence of professional football in American culture was depicted visually in the repeated shots of the skyline of Pittsburgh, in which the landscape is dominated by Heinz Field.",Null,1,3,31 March 2016
Youth," Pretentious Art Film
","With all due respect to the brilliant actor Michael Caine, this film was awful! High in the Swiss Alps, Caine plays a retired music conductor living out his final days as a morose and bitter old man. The film seeks to dramatize his awakening and his rediscovery of youth! What a crashing bore! Caine's character of Fred Ballinger has a daughter named Lena (Rachel Weisz), who serves as his publicist-manager. This character made no sense in the film because Fred had retired and he was fending off a British delegate from the Queen to return to England for to conduct a performance of his magnum opus of 'Simple Songs.' For the coherence of the screenplay, the daughter should have been negotiating with the delegate. Instead, she has no action or relevance to the film, other than to make the father even more callous and unsympathetic. The film included a set of cardboard characters whose dialogue sounded scripted. There is also a parallel plot about a film director, as played by Harvey Keitel, who is in the process of conceiving a film that is to be his swan song. Of course, the subplot permits the filmmakers to explore the highbrow theme of 'art representing life,' and so on...ad nauseam. The lame attempts at humor with Caine and Keitel cracking jokes about their prostate problems were not funny and bogged the film down even more.None of the characters were believable, and 'Youth' appeared to be capitalizing on the success of 'The Grand Budapest Hotel,' a film with more humor and more imagination.",Null,6,11,6 April 2016
"I, Tonya"," Bad Influences
","The saddest moment in 'I, Tonya' is when, at the lowest moment of her 23-year-old life, Tonya Harding is told by her domineering mother, 'You done good! I'm proud of you!' As this is apparently the only genuine affection Tonya has ever received from her mom, she grasps the mother in an embrace...and then discovers that LaVona Harding is carrying a tape recorder, attempting to get a confession from her daughter about her culpability in the notorious Nancy Kerrigan incident. The shattering moment described above is the culmination of the film's depiction of a tragic history of child and spousal abuse that plagued Tonya Harding growing up with her mother and later living with her rage-o-holic husband. At least from the filmmaker's point of view, 'I, Tonya' offers a perspective on the figure skater's life that was not apparent to the public in the 1990s. Director Craig Gillespie makes use of a quasi-documentary approach to Harding's story. Characters break the fourth wall and directly address the audience. We get different characters' perspectives on the rise and fall of Tonya Harding. It is a film style that offers an ironic and frequently humorous approach to what could have been a tragic saga. As Gillespie confessed in the DVD bonus track of the film, the script was 'a crazy dance between tragedy and comedy.'Center ice in the film is Margo Robbie with the formidable challenge of recreating Tonya Harding. Robbie does not resemble Harding physically; Amy Schumer would have been a dead ringer. But Robbie apparently worked on becoming an accomplished ice skater, and, above all, she reached into the soul of the young woman whose entire life revolved around figure skating.To the viewer, it becomes apparent early on that Harding was surrounded by idiots. With the exception of her devoted skating coach, Harding was on the receiving end of both physical and psychological abuse from both her mother LaVona, who pitches a steak knife into her daughter's right arm, and her cowardly husband Jeff Gillooly, who would beat her to a pulp and, on one occasion, shot her as she was attempting to flee from another beating. At times, the filmmakers get carried away in their attempt to paint a sympathetic picture of Tonya. This is most apparent in the suggestion that the skating judges would downgrade her performances because of her dress or demeanor. But 'style' is a component in competitive figure skating. Tonya Harding's style did not have the elegance of a Nancy Kerrigan. It did not even have the elegance of an amateur skater like Margot Robbie. Tonya's coaches could have worked with her more carefully on this part of her routines.Still, the film offered an insightful approach to Harding's life story. By the end of the film, there is a fresh perspective offered on the much maligned Tonya Harding. Instead of being 'loved, 'hated, or 'a punch line,' the Tonya Harding of this film is a robust, multi-dimensional, and all-too-flawed human being. Much credit belongs to Craig Gillespie as director, Steven Rogers as screenwriter, and Margot Robbie for pulling off this miracle on ice.",Null,1,1,16 March 2018
Molly's Game," 'Molly Dubin Bloom is My Name!'
","In the bonus segment of the DVD of 'Molly's Game,' the real Molly Bloom appears on camera to describe her life as 'a story about 'going for it' and succeeding in a man's world.' But the filmmakers went further to develop a character of impeccable ethical stature, whose photo should be on a Wheaties box instead of a police mug shot.The dynamic Molly Bloom who appears in the bonus segment is dynamically portrayed in the film by Jessica Chastain. The film takes much license with the biography of Miss Bloom to paint a picture of what writer-director Aaron Sorkin calls 'someone who does the right thing.' The moral preening in the film was far too excessive and smarmy. After a freak accident on the ski slopes that ruined a bid for Olympic gold, Molly went to Los Angeles where she became proficient in operating high-stakes poker games, catering to wealthy and powerful men and serving as stepping stone to the ruin of several compulsive gamblers. As an athlete, Molly's specialty was mogul skiing; in her second career, she was attracting mogul men to the poker table. Was Molly's goal only to make money? Or did she derive a subliminal pleasure from the power she exerted over men?The film descends into smarmy pop psychology in Molly's troubled relationship with her domineering and abusive father, a pompous psychologist, who performs a jaw-dropping three-question Freudian therapy session on his daughter. It is never quite clear if Molly is the abused woman, victimized by callous men, or if she is the abuser, exploiting men's weakness for gambling. At one key juncture in the film, Molly refers to herself as Circe, the Greek goddess who turned men into swine.There was an interesting dynamic between Molly and her slick defense attorney. But, as performed, the dialogue was delivered at such a fast pace that it was difficult to believe that two people could engage in such non-stop banter without at some point falling into a state of collapse. Much of this dialogue sounded 'scripted.' A fine turn of the phrase from Winston Churchill was squeezed into the dialogue, as his wisdom is recalled in 'the ability to move from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm.' This tenacity may have belonged as well to Molly Bloom, but she needed a pharmacy full of drugs to sustain her level of enthusiasm. Somehow, she was able complete online courses in astronomy while million-dollar poker pots were being exchanged on her table. Was this due to her 'enthusiasm' or to the rush from the drugs?The most frequently produced play of Arthur Miller, 'The Crucible,' figured in the drama of Molly Bloom. The attorney's young daughter is studying 'The Crucible,' which ends with John Proctor going to the gallows during the Salem witch trials in order to salvage his 'good name.' The film tries to draw a twenty-first century analogy with Molly Dubin Bloom's commitment to preserving her good name, which apparently is worth more to her than an Olympic gold medal. But despite the good performance by Chastain, the film's feel-good message was hollow and empty.",Null,2,4,11 April 2018
Black Mass," The Shocking Depiction of a Life in Crime
","Johnny Depp's portrayal of Boston crime boss James 'Whitey' Bulger must rank among the most repellent characters in recent Hollywood films. Perhaps the film's greatest achievement is to dramatize how Bulger escaped prosecution for blatant lawless, including racketeering and multiple murders for years. Incredibly, he lived undetected for sixteen years in an apartment in Santa Monica, California, prior to his arrest and conviction to two life terms in prison.One of the themes of the film is the loyalty that existed among the Irish men from South Boston. Bulger had lifelong ties to his childhood friend John Connolly, who became a career FBI agent and protected Bulger for years as a presumed informant. The sleaziness of the FBI agent, the associates of Bulger, and Whitey Bulger himself are a great accomplishment of the filmmakers.While much care went into the recreation of the period of the 1970s and '80s, the pacing of the film was slow and there were too many extraneous subplots and incidental events portrayed. The editing could have been tighter to focus on Bulger. Except for the depiction of his devotion to his mother and the tragic death of his young son, Bulger's personal life was not fully developed. It was not clear, for example, why he would not be a pallbearer at his mother's funeral.Despite its shortcomings, the film was a compelling portrayal of a life in crime and the shocking incompetence of the police and the FBI to allow Bulger to create mayhem and madness in Boston for so many years.",Null,0,1,6 May 2016
The Ottoman Lieutenant," Merhaba, Miss Lillie Rowe!
","While the title of this film is 'The Ottoman Lieutenant,' the protagonist is in fact Miss Lillie Rowe, the strong-willed young woman from Philadelphia, who visits Eastern Turkey in 1914, determined to deliver a truck and medical supplies to an American Christian mission hospital outside the city of Van.Miss Rowe has witnessed the racism in Philadelphia that segregates hospitals, and she finds herself in Turkey in the middle of two men who love her, one a Christian (Dr. Jude Fisher) and one a Muslim (Lieutenant Ismail Veli of the Ottoman Imperial Army). She also finds herself in the broader conflict of the Muslims interacting with the Christian Armenian population in Eastern Turkey.The film combines romance and history in an epic style with breathtaking vistas and landscapes in Turkey. Two of the most spectacular scenes were a glimpse of Agri Dagi (Mount Ararat) and the picturesque island of Ahtamar, as Miss Rowe was introduced to Turkey by the Ottoman Lieutenant. The film also made use of documentary footage from World War I and voice-over narration delivered by Miss Rowe to explain how Turkey sided with the Germany in World War I and faced an invasion from Russia.The senior physician at the mission, Dr. Woodruff, seems fatalistic that the medical facility might only serve as triage. By contrast, Miss Rowe genuinely believes that she can make a difference. She even sets Dr. Woodruff right in assisting him out of his depression and addiction to ether. He had suffered the loss of his wife to typhus, and, with the guidance of the idealistic Miss Rowe, he finally emerges from his indolence.The background on the Armenian genocide is developed haphazardly throughout the film. We learn from Dr. Jude Fisher that 'this war in Europe will split the country down the middle.' But there is only a vague sense of the Armenian slaughter that decimated the Armenian population in the early part of the war. The filmmakers would have us believe that the Turkish army was primarily intent on eliminating the Armenian 'rebels' who had gone over the side of the Russians. It is not until the ethically minded Ottoman Lieutenant takes a stand against civilian killings at the end that we get a glimpse into the atrocities committed against the Armenians at large.Overall, the film primarily develops the romantic narrative in the unfolding love triangle of Lille Rowe, Dr. Jude Fisher, and Lieutenant Ismail Veli. While the relationships were clearly developed, the film gave short shrift to the emerging passionate relationship of Miss Rowe and Lieutenant Veli. In the most intense scene, the Lieutenant stops and asks Miss Rowe, 'Are you sure?' That is a definite sign of lack of confidence not only on the part of the lieutenant, but by the filmmakers in handling the romantic content of their movie. And when Miss Rowe has to prompt her lieutenant to kiss her by asking what is the word kiss (Buse) in Turkish, the audience is genuinely concerned that the direction of this romantic relationship may not run a smooth course.There was a nice touch on the part of the filmmakers in developing a broader them of spirituality. When the Lieutenant takes Miss Rowe into the Blue Mosque in Constantinople, she asserts that 'it's like being inside God's thoughts.' That non-demoninational statement is effectively developed as a spiritual theme that joins the two characters in their quest to serve humanity in a time of crisis.",Null,6,15,1 August 2017
Closer," Nasty X 4
","I am unable to recall a film with characters less appealing than the foursome of 'Closer.' Each character has his or her shade of nastiness that runs through this excruciating film experience. One of the problems is that the dialogue does not provide the star actors (Julia Roberts, Jude Law, Clive Owen, and Natalie Portman) with sufficient motivation for the two pairs of lovers to be starting, ending, swapping, and resuming their relationships. The sudden and awkward transitions leave out the crucial scenes and moments where the relationships change. Out of this muddied and amateurish mess, there emerge three questions:(1) Was this film intended to be funny? If so, the effort falls way short of the satirical writing of Edward Albee in 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'--a film that was also directed by Mike Nichols. (2) Was this film supposed to be engaging in the psychology of love? If so, the better films in this category would be 'Dangerous Liaisons' or 'Valmont.' (3) Was this film intended to depict the realities of contemporary romantic relationships? If so, the better film would be 'Cast Away' wherein we see a much more healthy relationship with Tom Hanks and his soccer ball named Wilson. In the closing credits of 'Closer,' Patsy Rodenburg (one of the world's leading experts on Shakespearean text) is listed as the dialect coach for Natalie Portman, whose character is from New York. The IMDb bio of Natalie Portman indicates that she completed high school in New York. Did Patsy coach Natalie on her New York accent, or only on her Iago-like line readings?",Null,77,135,4 December 2004
Shutter Island," Overwrought & Heavy-Handed
","While there were some merits to 'Shutter Island,' including the fascinating island setting, the film was labored in the first half, then turned on an intriguing plot twist. Still, there is the clear impression from this reviewer that an actor other than Leonardo DiCaprio would have discovered greater depth in interpreting the main role of Teddy Daniels.The time is 1954. The setting is Boston Harbor. The more precise locale is an institution for the criminally insane in an Alcatraz of the East Coast. An innate is on the loose on the island, necessitating the arrival of the marshal, Teddy Daniels, and his sidekick, Chuck Aule. Unfortunately, the film really drags for the first hour as Daniels and Aule explore the island and are sized up the medical staff, including the two principal doctors, Cawley and Naehring. Ben Kingsley and MaxVon Sydow are in top form with an undercurrent of menace in their treatment of the visiting cops.During his whirlwind experience on the island, Teddy appears to be prone to visions or flashbacks, based upon his World War II experience of having discovered the horrors of Dachau as an American GI who first entered the camp. He was also traumatized by the death of his wife in a fire. But the dialogue seemed strained and artificial when a girl appears to Teddy and says, 'Why didn't you save me?' with Teddy's response a succinct, 'I got here too late.' Is Teddy recalling his experience at Dachau, or is it a more personal vision of a family member?In the essential structure of the film, the success depends in large part on the actor playing Teddy Daniels. DiCaprio often overacted the part. The role demanded many facets of the character's personality and nuanced responses to intense situations. Leo simply could not carry the film the way that was needed in the psychological dimensions of a complex character.",Null,1,1,24 August 2018
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Good Characters, Good Dialogue, But Uneven Results
","In the deleted scenes from 'Three Billboards' that appear on the DVD of the film, there is one priceless moment where Detective Dixon arrives home late and drunk. In the small home, Dixon sleeps in the same bedroom as his mother. After some strange, over-the-top physical contact and dialogue filled with innuendo, the mother asks the son,'You didn't do nothing bad tonight, did you, baby?' That line could apply to many of the characters of Ebbing on any given night.The film is richly deserving of praise for the memorable characters. But the inconsequential ending and the overall confusion in the meaning of the film were major shortcomings in an otherwise creative effort.For example, were the filmmakers attempting a satire of small town, rural America? If so, it is difficult to find any connection of the characters to reality. There was too much cruelty that stretched credibility without being truly provocative. This was especially true with the revenge-minded protagonist Mildred. With her outrageous (and criminal) behavior, one lost sympathy in a hurry for a grief-stricken and guilt-ridden mother. The character who seemed most grounded was Sheriff Willoughby, but he dropped out of the film by choice at the midpoint. There were a half dozen genuine moments of dark comedy, but too many head-shaking moments where the filmmakers went overboard in depicting the most psychologically unbalanced city on the planet.",Null,1,2,11 March 2018
Lion," A Sensitive Yet Flawed 'Lion'
","'Lion' was an exceptionally well-performed film that tackled serious issues, yet failed to resolve them. It was nonetheless an earnest approach to a number of delicate topics.The film was flawed in its failure to properly juggle two thematic strands: (1) the narrative of a separation of little boy from his family in Indian and his quest to search for his roots.(2) the problems faced by the kind mother and father in Australia, who adopted a pair of foundling children.It turned out that the first narrative completely overshadowed the second. The viewer feels so much empathy for the Australian mother and father, who clearly have struggled in raising the two adopted boys. Yet, we never actually see the child rearing and the home life except when the boys are adults.In the bonus section of the DVD, there were several deleted scenes. Yet not even the deleted scenes presented the home life of the two young boys. One can only wildly guess at why Mantosh developed a drug addiction. And it was left completely vague whether or not Saroo longed to return to India while he was raised by his new family. The film presented his search for his family roots only as an afterthought when he was an adult working a hotel.Without a doubt, the most sensitive performance of the film was that of Nicole Kidman as the Australian mother.

The Lost City of Z," 'A Man's Reach Should Exceed His Grasp'
","In the bonus segment of the DVD version of 'The Lost City of Z,' David Grann, the author of the book on which the film is based, asserts that the British amateur explorer Percy Fawcett was one of the 'last of his kind.' Both the author and the film's director, James Grey, compare Fawcett to Indiana Jones. But the true prototype of Fawcett is the swashbuckling adventurer T. E. Lawrence ('Lawrence of Arabia').This beautifully photographed film chronicles the three separate trips made to Brazil by Fawcett, whose initial goal of mapping the Verde River to determine a border conflict between Brazil and Bolivia, evolved into a much broader quest for discovering the historical origins of the region. Fawcett's trips of 1906, 1912, and 1924 led him to believe in what he called the 'lost city of Zed.' For Fawcett, 'Z' may have been a combination of the Garden of Eden and El Dorado. To his credit, Fawcett perceptively observed artifacts and archaeological findings that suggested a hidden civilization had thrived along the Amazon.The film may have overreached in developing Fawcett's perception of the 'Noble Savage.' But it was this same kind of support for indigenous population that had guided T.E. Lawrence in the Middle East. Indeed Lawrence and Fawcett were virtual contemporaries. But did Fawcett actually use the words 'We are made of the same clay' to describe the local Guarani Indians? The filmmakers work overtime in turning Fawcett into a champion of globalization.Fawcett's contentious relationship with England's Royal Geographical Society is one of the interesting subplots of the film. The idealistic Fawcett was at odds with the paternalistic approach to world exploration, as apparent in his conflict with Mr. Murray, the oversized representative of the British Empire, whose girth, laziness, and lack of courage nearly scuttle Fawcett's second expedition. For the third expedition, Fawcett found success in John D. Rockefeller and American journalists for his funding. But Fawcett is eventually recognized as 'England's bravest explorer' and is awarded the Founder's Gold Medal.Beyond his travel experiences, Fawcett fought with distinction and was wounded in a gas attack in the trenches of World War I. His long-suffering wife Nine, whom he fondly addresses as 'Cheeky,' as well as three beautiful children, Jack, Brian, and little Joan, were deprived for long stretches of their lives of a husband and father. But young Jack joined his father on the final, fateful Brazil expedition in 1924.SPOILER FOLLOWS: The film was successful in its approach to the strange disappearance of Fawcett and his son. Were they boiled alive as sacrificial victims, or did they join the community of the native Guarani Indians? In sum, 'The Lost City of Z' is an outstanding film epic with spectacular cinematography. The role of Fawcett was interpreted as a cheerful, intelligent, and idealistic remnant of the British Empire. He began his journey by attempting to reclaim the good name of his family after his father had squandered two family fortunes. But in the education he received from his journeys, his goal changed dramatically, as he came to recognize that 'We know so little of this world.'

Nightcrawler," Riveting Thriller With a Message
","In a remarkable performance, Jake Gyllenhaal plays Lou, an assertive ambulance chaser, locating scenes of violent crimes, filming the grisly scenes, and selling his footage to a Los Angeles news studio.The film charts the meteoric rise of a petty thief to a successful entrepreneur in video journalism. Gyllenhaal is joined by the equally effective Rene Russo, who plays the television news director who becomes overly invested in acquiring Lou's graphic film clips.The degree of sleaze apparent in both characters offers a fascinating social commentary on the degree to which news bureaus will stop at nothing to raise network ratings through the purveyance of lurid, tabloid stories.A successful news figure, Russo's character is depicted as part of the same mercenary mindset as Lou. The film even develops a bizarre personal compact between the two characters that implies a kind of sexual blackmail in their relationship.The direction of the film was superb with fascinating camera angles, set-ups, and location footage in Los Angeles. While the action scenes were impressive, it stretched credibility to see the streets devoid of traffic. No street in L.A. was as deserted as depicted in the film, even for nightcrawlers.",Null,0,0,19 February 2016
Bohemian Rhapsody," The Boy From Zanzibar
","'Bohemian Rhapsody' is a curious film biography, which chronicles the life of Farrokh Bulsara, who was born in Stone Town in the British protectorate of Zanzibar on September 5, 1946. He was transplanted to Middlesex, England in his teens and joined the rock group Queen in 1970. Farrrokh took the stage name of Freddie Mercury. The film chronicles his turbulent life that culminated in his death in 1991 at age forty-five.The main problem with the film is that Mercury is simply an unlikable character. He treats his proud father with disrespect. He takes advantage of his girl friend Mary, who he calls the love of his life, yet shuns her and make outrageous demands on her. Why, for example, was she never invited to accompany him on tour? And why must she wear her wedding ring even after the couple has split? Additionally, Mercury appears to have utter contempt for his collaborators in the Queen band, three musicians who gave the kid his first break as their lead singer.In any film biopic, there is the challenge of balancing the story of the artist's life with the music. Oliver Stone made an earnest attempt at a film biography of Jim Morrison in 'The Doors.' But a problem with Stone's film was that too much emphasis was placed on the concerts and recording sessions, and there was not enough depth of understanding of Morrison's life. The exact reverse was true of 'Bohemian Rhapsody,' wherein the focus was on the unpleasant personal life of a deeply troubled singer without commensurate attention given to the music.Mercury was quite the showman in his concerts, and the appeal was not evident in this motion picture. Instead, the focus was the tawdry elements of his personal life. At one point, Mercury feels betrayed when Mary has found a new boyfriend and has become pregnant. The dialogue goes as follows:MARY: 'I'm pregnant.'
FREDDIE: 'How could you!?'The melodrama often resembled a made-for-television film on the Lifetime Channel. Indeed, one of the visual images for Mercury's home life was a large framed poster of Gloria Swanson from 'Sunset Boulevard.' In that regard, Freddie always seemed to be 'on stage' and primping for his 'close up.' The film was unsuccessful in portraying a tortured artist, only a fragile Little Lord Fauntleroy who never grew up.There is a revealing moment in the film when Jim Hutton, working in catering at one of Mercury's decadent parties, tells Mercury candidly that he might like to become his friend if and when 'you start to like yourself.' In the closing stretch of this long film, there was lame attempt to reveal a repentant Mercury, attempting to atone for the sins he committed against his friends and colleagues. But it was too little, too late to redeem this sleazy, self-loathing character in the eyes of the audience.",Null,3,6,18 February 2019
The Village," Disturbing Film! Stylish and Thoughtful Cinematography!
","M. Night Shyamalan is one of our most creative and singular directors, recalling the styles of many of the European film auteurs. In 'The Sixth Sense' and 'Unbreakable,' there were fascinating locales within the urban confines of Philadelphia. In 'The Sign' and 'The Village,' the uniquely sinister mood is evoked in rural Pennsylvania.In 'The Village,' Shyamalan develops a story around the daily life of a strict communevirtually a cultliving in a small community in rural Pennsylvania in the nineteenth century. It is a hothouse environment with people held together with a bond of fear due to the mysterious appearances of supernatural creatures. The casting of the film was outstanding with Joaquin Phoenix, Adrien Brody, William Hurt, and Sigourney Weaver as major figures within the community. Above all, it is the performance of Bryce Dallas Howard who delivers the emotional impact of the drama as a young blind woman named Ivy, who is forced to make an arduous journey for essential medicines for her fiancé. The mysteries and indeed the secrets of the community unfold along with Ivy's odyssey.In the undercurrent of violence which ran through the film, 'The Village' recalls the famous and disturbing 1955 novel of William Golding, 'The Lord of the Flies.' In Golding's story, a group of boys isolated on an island discover the hidden, violent impulses lurking from within when forced to function on their own in a community. In the rural Pennsylvania of 'The Village,' the story of commune is nearly identical to the world of 'The Lord of the Flies.' The so-called elders of the community seek to promote a peaceful existence. But like a self-fulfilling prophecy, the violence will emerge and potentially tear the village asunder.",Null,0,0,31 July 2005
The Revenant," Bleak Film Lacks Redemptive Power
","'The Revanant' is a film of stark contrasts. The magnificent scenery and photography are set against human greed, betrayal, and depravity. The result is a film that leaves one feeling empty and sad about the Western push of our nation's history.Set in 1823, the film tells the story of a group of American trappers who come under attack by a small band of the Arikara tribe. After suffering heavy casualties, the survivors escape, led by their guide, Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio). In turn, Glass is betrayed when, after being critically wounded by a bear, the men who have sworn to protect him, kill his son and leave him exposed to the elements.At this point, the film turns into a survival and revenge story. There is little dialogue during this lengthy stretch of the film with the emphasis placed on the magnificent landscape and panoramic vistas. The strength of the film is in the cinematography.Arguably, DiCaprio's performance succeeded through assistance with the make-up and hairstyle specialists. He speaks very little dialogue, and the character's sotto voce speaking was a set of whispers, due his throat wound in the encounter with the bear. DiCaprio's Academic Award should be divided among the designers, who, in effect, created his character.A stunning film visually, 'The Revanant' never fulfills its potential as a historical drama or even an insightful character study. The goal instead was to create a blockbuster.",Null,0,0,17 May 2016
Split," Kevin Wendell Crumb, etc.
","The films of M. Night Shyamalan typically exploit the supernatural in order to develop a suspenseful story with well-rounded characters. Unfortunately, 'Split' relies primarily on pop psychology to explore a troubled man's multiple personalities in what is called Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID). The wildly speculative case study in the film includes one personality type that should be placed in a cage and out of harm of any bystanders.The bystanders who come in the way of Kevin Wendell Crumb, who has a habit of ending his sentences with the expression 'etcetera.,' are three young women who are improbably kidnapped and held hostage by Kevin, etc. The one character who is more interesting that all of the characters rolled into Kevin, etc. is the young loner Casey Cooke. As developed in lurid detail through flashbacks, little Casey was an abused child who has learned to cope with her pedophile tormentor, Uncle John. Her survival skills will be put to the test by Kevin, etc.A kindly psychiatrist (well performed by stage actress Betty Buckley) badly underestimates the capabilities of her patient. She deludes herself into believing that she has some control over the wide-ranging behavior of Kevin, etc. Her fatal mistake is to pay a visit to his home. The alert viewer will surely recognize that her fate is sealed when she arrives at his odd living quarters, which turn out to be the sub-basement of the Philadelphia zoo.SPOILER ALERT FOLLOWS: M. Night Shyamalan's original ending for the film appears as an outtake in the DVD version of 'Split.' Curiously, the director changed the ending because he felt the original version was too dark. The deleted scene was to have Kevin seated atop a building decrying how unfortunate it was that most people go about their lives in an un-split manner, as opposed his subjective realities of multiple personalities. But in a film that is so unpleasant from the outset, it was difficult to see how changing the final scene could possibly have made the film any less depressing than it already was.",Null,2,8,18 May 2017
Collateral," Collateral': Spotlight on Film Director Michael Mann
","The best scene in Michael Mann's 'Collateral' is a late-night conversation in a dowdy jazz club in Los Angeles. The conversation between Tom Cruise's hired killer Vincent and the club owner played by Barry Shabaka Henley is riveting, as the trumpet player recalls a chance meeting with the legendary Miles Davis. The scene is so realistic that it could have been lifted from Ken Burns' epic PBS series 'Jazz.' At the same time, director Mann brings to the scene the same powerful subtext achieved in his film 'Heat' when Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro played out a memorable conversation across the table in a restaurant. The jazz scene in 'Collatoral' was brilliantly written. But it was the careful set-ups, camera angles, and subtext of the performances that made for brilliant film-making.Beyond this memorable scene, there is an edgy undercurrent to nearly all of the conversations in 'Collateral,' starting with the engaging scene in the cab between Jamie Foxx and Jada Pinkett Smith. All of the performances in this film are outstanding, especially Foxx as the intelligent, underachieving cab driver. I especially admired how the director subtly conveyed within the psyche of Tom Cruise's contract killer a mystery about the character's past. There is a long scene where the hit-man Vincent tells a harrowing tale of family abuse when he was a child, then informs cabdriver Max that he was just kidding. But was he? There are many complexities to the characters effectively layered into the film by Mann. The stylish cinematography is another trademark of Mann's work. His choices in colors and lighting aesthetics are especially noteworthy in 'Collateral.' The location filming in Los Angeles, including the different nightclubs were memorable moments of the film. The unique stamp of Mann's style was apparent in an early film like 'Thief' (1981), which was ahead of its time in film technique. In 'Collateral,' the overall effect is that of a 'Naked City' presented with brutal honesty.For all of its gritty realism, however, some of the action sequences, especially the climactic 'death' scene, were surprisingly incredible. There are lengthy chase scenes on totally deserted streets in downtown Los Angeles. For anyone who has driven around L.A. at any time of the day or night, it would be difficult to imagine zipping around freeways and streets that look like those portrayed in this film. In the 60 years since the curfew imposed during the years of World War II, there have never been streets as empty in Los Angeles as those depicted in 'Collateral.'",Null,2,2,12 June 2005
Dunkirk," 'Wars Are Not Won By Evacuations'
","One of the realizations of Winston Churchill noted in this film is that 'wars are not won by evacuations.' The evacuation of Dunkirk in response to the overwhelming German invasion of northern Europe in May, 1940, led to the successful evacuation of more than 330,000 allied soldiers. As indicated at the start of the film, the traditional way of looking at Dunkirk was as a 'miracle.'As a war film, the conceptual approach to the Dunkirk evacuation is apparent in the three-pronged visual choices of (a) land, (b) air, and (c) sea. The film proceeds to alternate scenes in the these three spheres to demonstrate the evacuation as it unfolds through courageous British figure pilots, civilian pilots of small ships, and the combined forces of the allied navy and army on the land.This film experience falls short of expectations as a historical film. There is no attempt to place the narrative in context of what actually happened at Dunkirk. Beyond the heroic evacuation effort, the true miracle was that the German armed forces did not press the matter to thwart the escape. It would have been easy to concentrate German army and air forces to prevent the evacuation. That did not occur because of one of the biggest blunders of World War II in the poor judgment of Adolf Hitler, who hesitated at this moment and, against the advice of his generals, allowed the successful evacuation to occur.'Dunkirk' is clearly intended as a 'feel good' patriotic film. The harrowing experience of this unique situation is dramatically evoked as the film abruptly shifts from the 'mole' (the beach redoubt) to the sea (the mad dash to Dover) to the air (the handful of German fighter pilots strafing the shore and the ships.) In the closing credits, the film is dedicated to 'all those whose lives were impacted by the events at Dunkirk.' But the filmmakers do not seem to realize that virtually everyone alive on the planet today falls in that category, due to the stupidity of Hitler.",Null,0,0,27 December 2017
Jackie," Epic Story Reduced to the Size of a Postage Stamp
","While it was a noble idea to attempt to depict the JFK assassination through the perspective of the widowed First Lady, Jacqueline Kennedy, the film came up short due to an overly complex layering of timeframes and flashbacks, plus the absence of careful research into assassination of President Kennedy.Orson Welles' 'Citizen Kane' made use of the technique of the interview to recall a range of perspectives on its larger-than-life protagonist. But 'Jackie' does not rise to the same level in the mundane sequences between Mrs. Kennedy and the historian, who may be a mélange of William Manchester and Theodore White. Their scenes together seemed flat, and the historian never truly drew the subject into his confidence. Even when the historian bids farewell to Mrs. Kennedy after the final interview, they do not even shake hands.The film was also untidy with historical details, such as a dramatic moment when Mrs. Kennedy tries to enter the autopsy room at Bethesda Navel Hospital. There is no evidence that such a scene occurred. At this moment, Mrs. Kennedy, still in shock, was being sedated and was on a different floor of the hospital with her brother-in-law Robert Kennedy.For most viewers, the principal interest of the film will be Natalie Portman in the role of Mrs. Kennedy. While there was good feeling in her interpretation of the role, Portman never came close to depicting Mrs. Kennedy's breathy voice. Despite work with a dialect coach, the East Coast accent was not right either. Physically, Portman was far too thin for the role, and she never conveyed the often statuesque carriage of the public Jacqueline Kennedy.Some of the design work of the filmmakers was admirable, especially the recreation of the interior of the White House and the street scenes in Washington, D.C. during the assassination weekend. Unfortunately, the design values were not enough to compensate for the inability to truly capture history as it was unfolding from November 22-25, 1963.The most interesting concept entertained by the filmmakers was the dynamic of how Mrs. Kennedy personally shaped history during the assassination weekend. In one of her interviews, she states that history is what is written, and the final discursive appraisal of history may have little bearing on the truth. The film posits that Mrs. Kennedy placed a carefully designed spin on the way that history would remember her husband, his idealized coterie of Camelot, and, above all, her own image. The theme of how history may be transformed into a myth had unlimited potential for exploration in this film. But results were lackluster.In the 'extra' track of the DVD version of 'Jackie,' the director Pablo Larraín explained how he diced up his film footage in the editing room to make a complicated cinematic mosaic. But it was unfortunate that the writer and director of 'Jackie' did not take an interest in the broader scope of how history was being rewritten in the murder in Dealey Plaza, the Bethesda autopsy, and the machinations that were occurring in the halls of power in Washington, D.C. in the murder of our thirty-fifth president.",Null,3,4,21 April 2017
Meet the Fockers," Worth Watching For One Reason: Dustin Hoffman
","I enjoyed the sequel 'Meet the Fockers' more than the original 'Meet the Parents' for one reason: the performance of Dustin Hoffman. Overall, it was a fine ensemble cast and good scripting of the jokes and situations surrounding the irrepressible ex-CIA agent and family patriarch Jack Byrnes (Robert DeNiro). But Hoffman's character Bernie Focker, an attorney who retired to become a full-time dad to his son Greg (Ben Stiller), grounds this comedy in solid human values that raise the film beyond the level of nutty comedy.I admired how Hoffman's character revealed genuine pain following the nasty remarks of Jack Byrnes. For example, the shrine of framed memorabilia of his son's accomplishments was ridiculed by Jack. One could empathize with Bernie's pain which he registered at the criticism. Indeed throughout the film, the most memorable scenes were those with Hoffman's character on the defense, but also taking the offensive against Jack. The film also included some wildly funny moments, such as the teenager born out of wedlock to Greg's babysitter, a young lad with humongous eyebrows who was a dead-ringer for Ben Stiller's character and Jack's outrageous motor home rigged with listening devices, which provided him with his command center for spying on the Fockers. Much credit should go to director Jay Roach for outstanding comic rhythms, timing, and pacing.In the end, this was thoroughly enjoyable movie, which had the surprising effect of providing a good window into family values unusual for Hollywood film comedies.",Null,37,49,6 November 2005
The Favourite," Acid Wit is Not Enough to Save This Slow-Burner
","'The Favourite' has to be one of the most overrated films of 2018. The filmmakers take the relatively little-known reign of Queen Anne and deconstruct the Queen and her court into a post-modern pastiche of proto-feminist clichÃ©s.The most troubling aspect of the film was the self-conscious attempt to distort history without any clear purpose other than a mordant humor evolving out of unpleasant characters and situations. It was unclear why John Churchill, the First Duke of Marlborough would be brought down from his rightful heroic place in history to a cuckold, whose military exploits are completely misrepresented in the film.It was clear that the goal of the filmmakers was to focus on the three women characters of Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough; Queen Anne; and Abigail Hill, Sarah's impoverished cousin. It is Abigail who becomes the catalyst for the film's action in her capacity as a devious social climber. More than a survivor, she is a plotter of palace intrigues whose amoral actions are entirely self-serving.In the director's approach to this dramatic material, he devised a labored pace to the film that included long pauses and meandering scenes with characters wandering around the palace. It was an incongruous aesthetic choice to have the slow pacing along with the acerbic wit of the characters. The result was an Oscar Wilde play conceived in slow motion.In grading this film, it is worth no more than three stars, one for each of the three central characters: the fussy Queen Anne, the scheming Sarah, and Abigail the survivor. But overall, it doesn't add up to a cohesive whole, and, sadly, it is difficult to genuinely care about the three dynamic characters.",Null,1,3,7 March 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Inglorious Hollywood
","In the bonus track of the DVD of 'Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood,' there is a montage of deleted scenes that reveals the satirical style of writer-director Quentin Jerome Tarantino. The most typical of the scenes is a television commercial for a fictitious brand of cigarettes called Little Red Apples. The commercial drips with irony in promoting something destructive to a human body that is being portrayed in a over-the-top way not dissimilar to the actual ads of the mid-twentieth century. The cigarette commercial demonstrates in microcosm the film's overall approach to violence in the 1960s.In the film's graphic violence twisted into satire, the filmmaker attempts a retrospective of the tragic Tate-La Bianca murders of 1969 and indeed violence as a whole on one of the most self-destructive decades in American history. The humor derives from shifting the perspective on the murders and rewriting history through the lens of two Hollywood types, a grade-B movie star of the Westerns, Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his sidekick stuntman, Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt).The viewer is forced to slog through most of the film that seeks to present a slice of life in the Los Angeles film colony of 1969. Far too much time is spent in establishing atmosphere and stringing out scenes that are overwritten with pacing that is a slow as L.A. rush-hour gridlock. One of the most unnecessary sequences is the long stretch at the Spahn Ranch that even fails to introduce the character of Charles Manson.The film's payoff finally arrives with the fateful night of August 8, 1969, when Tarantino pulls off a 'what if' scenario, wherein the life of the beautiful Sharon Tate is spared due to the heroics of the star of the TV program 'Bounty Law' and his faithful and quick-thinking buddy, who is on acid at the time!The most interesting character is without a doubt the faithful Cliff Booth, as played with great gusto by Pitt. Cliff's devotion to his pal Rick has no bounds, and the character has the kind of decency that was at the heart of the stock characters and melodramatic television series built around myths of the Wild West, on which he has built his career.The film still depicts a nightmare on Cielo Drive. But it also provides some much-needed distance from the gruesome realities of the event to serve as a reference point for understanding the most violent of decades in modern American history.",Null,1,3,13 December 2019
Get Out," Multi-Layered Film Delivers a Punch
","'Get Out' is a film with the perfect title. At around the midpoint, the audience cannot help but wish that the protagonist named Chris would find away to get out of his first visit to the home of the parents of his girlfriend.The strength of this film is the careful layering of styles. At the outset, it appears as if the film is a straight drama of the introduction of the black boyfriend to the white woman's parents, much like the Sidney Poitier film 'Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?' But the film smoothly segues into the horror genre when it slowly becomes apparent that Chris has walked into a trap. The early glimpses of the two black household servants and the hypnosis session occurring without the consent of Chris were two of the key transitional scenes.But the filmmakers successfully incorporate yet another element into the mix: humor. The sly comic timing of Chris's best friend Rod, who is an airport TSA investigator, is at the heart of each of his scenes. The humor serves as a leavening to what otherwise would have been a one-dimension horror story. It was not entirely clear what message the filmmakers were attempting to deliver about racism. The film's premise of the 'Coagula procedure,' or the surgery being performed by Dr. Armitage that is the rough equivalent of a frontal lobotomy was shocking. Another repugnant scene was the modern equivalent of a slave auction when the various bidders were holding up their Bingo cards; one only realizes in hindsight that they were bidding on Chris. But what was the point of these shocking scenes and the overall premise of eugenics?In sum, this film offers a wide palette of thriller/horror, drama, and wry humor that make for a fast-paced and engaging viewing experience. Against a $4.5 million film budget, 'Get Out' has earned international grosses of more than $250 million.

Room," A Lifetime Channel-Movie with a Big Budget
","Watching 'Room' is like taking in a film on the Lifetime channel with an A-list cast and a big budget. Like the novel that was the basis for the film, there is a two-part melodramatic structure to the narrative.Melodrama #1 depicts the harrowing captivity of a woman held hostage by her captor for a seven-year period in a dingy, claustrophobic shed in the offender's back yard. Two years into captivity, the woman delivered a baby boy, who is now five years old. The first half of the film plays out like a Harold Pinter drama with the mundane dialogue of the mother and son, plus menacing visits from the captor.The second melodramatic action follows the daring escape of the child, who is successful in alerting the authorities, who free the mother from the shed. The second half of the film is the more engaging because it introduces the family members and seeks to portray the recovery of the traumatized mother and child. Unfortunately, there are too many plot holes in this intense drama, the most glaring of which is the insensitivity of the grandfather character, as played by W. H. Macy.The screenplay was adapted by Emma Donoghue from her novel, and her strong suit is in storytelling, not character motivation. At one of the crucial junctures of the film, when the mother needed support from the family, the grandfather refused to even look at the boy.In the novel, it is made clear that the father is tormented by the idea that the grandson would have the same face as the perpetrator who abducted and raped his daughter. But in the film, the little boy's face is a dead ringer for the mother--not the father. The motivation was not spelled out in the screenplay, and the film's director was completely oblivious of the unmotivated action of the grandfather. In the DVD's commentary track, the director spoke of deleting a scene where the grandfather peeks into the bedroom of the little boy, but still cannot bring himself to look at the child. By restoring that scene, the motivation for Macy's character would still be confusing to the audience.At the premiere of the film at the Landmark Theatre on West Pico in Los Angeles, there was an artistic installation of the 11' X 11' room that was recreated on the site. Such a display indicates the shortcomings of this film in the superficial treatment of a serious topic. This film should have offered a strong social commentary about predators like the one who abducted the young woman. Shouldn't the television reporter be investigating the perpetrator, instead of grilling the young woman, as we see in the film? The overall effect of the film sadly trivializes a serious subject and turns a topic that should evoke moral outrage into a routine tearjerker.",Null,7,15,1 March 2016
A Quiet Place," Swiss Family Robinson Against the Grasshoppers
","'A Quiet Place' is a turgid and slow-moving horror film built on the same premise as the H.G. Wells classic 'The War of the Worlds.' The earth has been invaded by creatures from another planet that are seemingly indestructible. In the Wells' story, the creatures were giant robots; in 'A Quiet Place,' they are giant grasshoppers.'The War of the Worlds' is a much better story and film. Wells was recreating the human landscape in science fiction form based on the horrors of World War I. By contrast, 'A Quiet Place' is a generic horror film. And, it is boring.The conceit of the film is that the humans must remain quiet because the creatures can only detect them through sound. But the byproduct is that the audience must suffer through long periods of silence as the family communicates by signs.There was nothing special in photography, set-ups, and shots. The drama played out in clichÃ© fashion where the modern day Swiss Family Robinson finally discovers the weakness of the creatures.A major question is why did the family take so long to figure out the secret?

Call Me by Your Name," Boys Will Be Boys!
","In the idyllic setting of Northern Italy in the summer of 1983, an ebullient, wordly visiting scholar arrives to work closely with an archaeologist in excavating sensual Hellenistic statues. That the statue they uncover is a copy of Praxiteles' 'Venus' speaks volumes about the story that is to unfold. The cocky and arrogant visitor is warmly welcomed into the home with the feeling that 'mi casa es su casa.' But the welcome apparently extends to the scholar seducing the underage son of the host!In this eyebrow-raising drama, there is an extended period of flirtation and innuendo with the scholar (Oliver) and the seventeen-year-old boy (Elio). Lengthy scenes depict the mature man and the teenager cavorting, wrestling, bicycling, swimming, dancing, and engaging in general horseplay. Their mantra could be 'Catch me if you can!!!'Finally, the moment of truth arrives where the boy is seduced. Then, the visitor leaves, returning to his fiancée in America where he will be married in a heterosexual union. Yet someone both the boy and the older man cannot let go of their febrile union in the lush terrain of Tuscany. Astonishingly, the film draws extensively on ancient Greek culture with the statues and philosophers to portray the ancient Greek tradition of the mature male 'initiating' a boy into sex with the sense that the male-male love connection is superior to that of a man and a woman.The most jaw-dropping moment in the film is a lengthy monologue at the end where the professor, who has by now discovered that the coupling of the visitor and the son has taken place under his own roof, delivers a pious and sanctimonious lecture to his son. The father implies to Elio that he will never experience anything like the love ardor he felt for the older man and that he will likely be physically and emotionally 'bankrupt at the age of thirty,' due to the humdrum experiences he will have in the future with women! It would have been interesting if the professor's wife had been eavesdropping on her husband's paternal wisdom imparted to her son.In one of the most dishonest subplots of the film, young Elio seduces a young woman friend at the time that he is falling in love with the older man. He then callously discards the young woman, undoubtedly breaking her heart. It was completely unconvincing when the young woman later shakes hands with Elio, asserting she harbors no ill will, and hopes that they will be friends for life! In matters of the heart, that is usually not the way it works.The smarmy nature of this pretentious art film comes across in the bonus segment titled 'The Making of Call Me By Your Name' that is included in the DVD version of the film. The young actor playing Elio has bought into the film's phony message that the story is 'a lens into a young person's existence.' That assertion sounds like another one of the platitudes spoken in the film, such as the choice words from the father that 'nature has cunning ways to finding our weakest spot.' On the other hand, the actor is right on the mark about another inference of the word 'lens.' One aspect of the film that was successful was the cinematography. The filmmakers chose to use the 35mm single lens throughout the shoot. The lens permitted both long shots and close-ups in continuous film sequencing. The Italian locations, landscapes, and cityscapes were examples of creative work with the camera. Unfortunately, the beautiful work with the lens did not make up for the shallow and unconvincing narrative that reflected the sordid nature of hedonistic and self-absorptive human conduct in the shenanigans that were occurring in the old Italian villa. To boil the film down to the baser instincts that it was portraying, a more apt title would have simply been 'Boys Will Be Boys!'",Null,3,15,31 March 2018
Pawn Sacrifice," The Price of Genius
","'Pawn Sacrifice' is an excellent biographical portrait of the mercurial master chess player Bobby Fischer. As indicated by director Edward Zwick in the bonus segment of the DVD, the film is about 'the confrontation of genius and madness.' Zwick provides good pacing, especially in the tension-packed chess sequences. There was a thoughtful attempt to capture the careful decision-making process of each move on the board by the various players.In the popular perception of Bobby Fischer, there has perpetually been an uncertainty about whether Fischer was grandstanding and playing mind games with his chess opponents, or whether he was psychologically unbalanced. The film takes a clear stand that Fischer suffered from severe paranoia and other mental afflictions.Tobey McGuire is good as the tortured American chess wizard. At the same time, there was a measured, understated quality to McGuire's performance that did not quite do justice to the flamboyance of the historical Bobby Fisher. The more complete performance is turned in by Liev Schreiber as the stoic, icy Soviet champion, Boris Spassky Their characters made an effective study in contrast.There was also the sense that the pressures placed on both Fischer and his Soviet rival, Spassky, were exacerbated by the respective American and Soviet governments, which sought to exploit the chess contest during the Cold War.

From their accidental first meeting in a hotel through the development of their relationship on and off the tennis courts, the scenes were heart-warming and filmed in unusual and attractive locations around London. My favorite sequence was in Peter's attempt to play 'Romeo' and climb up the vines into the bedchamber of Lizzie. It was impressive as well that both Dunst and Bettany sported good athleticism in their highly convincing tennis scenes. My only criticism of the film was in the screenplay. A number of the characters, including a hyperactive agent and a worried parent-manager, seemed extraneous to the main action. The narrative was padded and would have benefited from a stronger subplot. But in the portrayal of the principal relationship of the two young tennis players, 'Wimbledon' offered a delightful and winning combination!",Null,1,1,8 July 2005

The screenplay was outstanding, and the performances were uniformly excellent.The film juggles the lives of three remarkable women. Dorothy Vaughn became the first African-American female supervisor at NASA in her work in computer programming. Mary Jackson fought the legal system in Virginia in order to register for night classes in order to improve her chances to become and engineer. And the film's primary focus is on Catherine G. Johnson, a brilliant student of mathematics, who was instrumental in calculating the data for the earliest American space launches.The biggest historical drama depicted by the film is the launch of the Friendship 7 mission, described as one of the turning points in the space race with Colonel John Glenn returned safely to earth. Katherine Johnson worked behind the scenes, crossing the color barrier in one of the great intellects at NASA. At one point in the film, Johnson thinks outside of the box when she goes to the ancient calculations of Euler's Method, stunning her colleagues with a set of accurate numerical results. The hidden figures of mathematics emerge in the film, just as the three women come into their own as hidden figures in the early period of civil rights.The film balances the space saga with the challenges of the three women faced in the era of Jim Crow. Much time is devoted to the daily humiliation of segregated restrooms, drinking fountains, and even coffee pots within the NASA organization. Kevin Costner is good as the crusty project manager, who recognizes the genius of Katherine Jackson. Kirsten Dunst plays the callous supervisor of the women, who finally comes round to supporting the promotion of Dorothy Vaughn.The period style of the early 1960s was faithfully created by the filmmakers. Documentary footage of the early NASA missions helped to bring the hidden figures out of the background and place them in an era of ferment of change in American history.",Null,1,5,21 May 2017
Million Dollar Baby," Swank! Eastwood! Freeman!
","It would be difficult to imagine a more perfect trio of performers the likes of Hilary Swank, Clint Eastwood, and Morgan Freeman in their respective roles in the emotionally-charged 'Million Dollar Baby.' My favorite scenes were the early sequences in which Maggie (Swank) visits the dowdy boxing gym and co-opts Eastwood's crusty boxing trainer Frankie into becoming her mentor. Along with the veteran, retired boxer Eddie, played by Freeman, the performances were as electric as the Ali shuffle.In the overall arc of the story of 'Million Dollar Baby,' there were three extraneous subplots: (1) Frankie's visits to church and his talks with the priest; (2) the story of the mentally-challenged young man named Danger, who appears in the gym and is taunted by the boxers; and (3) Maggie's family members introduced in two scenes filled with such vulgarity that much of the film's hard-earned credibility was lost. Not only would the film have worked effectively without the subplots, it would have been a much better film without them.While Eastwood's direction was superb, much credit should also go to the designers, especially the stylish work with lighting. I cannot recall a film as dimly lit as this one, and the subdued lighting contributed substantially to the characters and mood evoked in this sensitive film. The three main performances were standouts. But this film was also a very successful team effort.",Null,107,165,8 January 2006
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," The 'Extended' Version is Superb!
","The outtakes that were compiled for the special 'extended' version of 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' added to the atmosphere and the character developments. Above all, the new footage helped to clarify a number of the plot strands in the Swedish adaptation of the best-selling novel by Stieg Larsson.The principal narrative of the search for what happened to the character 'Harriet,' as begun by the tycoon Henry Vanger was not terribly compelling in its own right. Harriet had been presumed dead after the passing of forty years, yet Henry Vanger received an annual reminder that forced him never to forget the disappearance of Harriet.The evolving relationship of the two collaborators, Bloomqvist and Lisbeth Salander, is what makes the search intriguing. The beautiful photography in the outdoor scenes and the remote location of the Vanger enclave also contributes to the mystique. The film could have been a mundane 'Clue' or Agatha Christie mystery; instead, the film had psychological depth and nuance.Above all, it is the magnetic Noomi Rapace who sustains attention for three hours. Her compelling interpretation is guided by the intensity of her eyes, as captured in the close-ups and the camera angles. The character development is unforgettable, as she begins to discover human compassion in the kind journalist, who becomes her colleague, companion, and lover while relentlessly pursuing the truth.",Null,2,2,10 November 2019
Cold War," Oh, Zuzanna!!!
","In the tradition of 'Dr. Zhivago,' 'Zimna wojna' is a highly-charged political film framed in the context of an epic love story. The two films also share a resemblance in the stunning cinematography. Instead of the spectacular color photography of David Lean, 'Zimna wojna' is filmed in a lush black-and-white style by Pawel Pawlikowski.The incomparable uses of music and dance help to drive the action of the film. A group of Polish peasants is assembled in Warsaw as the Cold War is heating up in 1949. But a pretender enters the company, who is not a peasant at all. This is the dynamic and talented Zuzanna 'Zula' Lichon, who had apparently made an attempt on the life of her abusive father, then ran away to audition for the folk singers. She fatefully meets the conductor, Wiktor Warski, and the stormy relationship that cover the entire sweep of Eastern and Western Europe unfolds.The film is not entirely successful in depicting the political ramifications of its title. We do not really see the human rights abuses and the political repression of the Eastern Bloc nations. And, the Western European nations are portrayed superficially as sleazy and decadent. The lines of dialogue are occasionally overwrought with loaded political implications, when Zula tells Wiktor in Paris, 'In Poland, you were a man; you are different here' or when Zula is lectured by Wiktor's love on the meaning of a 'metaphor.'The moves from Poland to East Germany to Paris to Zagreb and back to Warsaw, spanning the years 1949-64. Some of the locations were stunning, especially a hollowed out Eastern Orthodox church that figures prominently in the action.The film is worth seeing for the mesmerizing performance of Joanna Kulig as Zula. Like Julie Christie as Lara in 'Doctor Zhivago,' Kulig delivers a knock-out performance, especially in her singing. The turbulent love relationship of Zula and Wiktor mirrors the Cold War battles that nearly destroyed the world. In the case of 'Zimna wojna,' two souls were drawn together and were nearly destroyed, not so much by the world around them, as by their human frailty.",Null,0,0,20 April 2019
Prisoners," Was This Film a Thriller? Action Film? or Horror Story? Or All of the Above?
","While 'Prisoners' has won acclaim for its style, the film's content is both unpleasant and stretches credibility beyond the pale.Hugh Jackman as Keller Dover and Jake Gyllenhaal as Detective Loki are both excellent in the leading roles, and director Denis Villeneuve evokes plenty of suspense in his lighting, camera angles, and pacing. But as the film unfolds, the story of the abduction of two children becomes more and more depressing.One of the problems with the film was the extremely unappealing characters. Jackman's role goes well beyond that of the concerned parent, as he breaks the law by kidnapping and torturing the young man whom he believes is the perpetrator. Gyllenhaal's detective is also concerned; but he is also inept and becomes so out of control emotionally that he attacks another suspect while in police custody, turning the prime suspect into another victim when he commits suicide.The convoluted kidnapping plot is never completely unraveled in the film. SPOILER ALERT FOLLOWS: As the film moves towards its climax, one of the little girls who has escaped her captors, implicates Jackman's character as one of the kidnappers who had placed tape over the mouths of the victims. The family of Keller Dover owned the residence where an earlier kidnapping the murder had occurred. It is that residence where Keller Dover takes Alex Jones (Paul Dano) to be tortured. So, the clear implication is that the devoted father was somehow involved in the original kidnapping plot.While worthy of discussion and admirable for the good performances, 'Prisoners' seems incomplete as a film, the final cut no more than a work in progress.",Null,1,5,11 February 2016
Silence," 'Silence' is Golden
","This ambitious historical film is set in seventeenth-century Japan at a moment when European Jesuit missionaries had worn out their welcome. Two Portuguese priests set out on a mission to locate their mentor, Father Ferreira, after reports suggest that he has renounced Christianity and converted to Buddhism. The film unfolds like Joseph Conrad's 'Heart of Darkness' with a long journey up the river in search of the apostate.SPOILER ALERT FOLLOWS: The final encounter of Fr. Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Father Ferreira (Liam Neeson)is a thoughtful conversation about the often futile attempts of the Jesuits to impose their values on other cultures. The wise Mark Twain realized this shortcoming and fulminated about those darned missionaries in his lectures. 'Silence' offers an extremely insightful dialogue in the different positions presented by the two priests.Unfortunately, the film has an endless buildup in order to arrive at that final conversation. Despite the beautiful cinematography, there is far too much screen violence that was entirely unnecessary to present the film's message. From the outset, it was clear that the filmmakers wanted to depict a clash of cultures. The slow-moving and sprawling pace of the film will be off-putting to many viewers.Like Conrad's 'Heart of Darkness,' 'Silence' is really the story of one main character. Like Kurtz, Fr. Ferreira's experience has led him to per deeply into the human soul, and the vision that he sees in not pretty. 'Silence' opens up the possibility for an understanding of religious tolerance, not only in the seventeenth century, but for us today.",Null,0,0,1 April 2017
Hotel Mumbai," The Battle for the Hotel Mumbai
","In the bonus track of the DVD of 'Hotel Mumbai,' the film's director, Anthony Maras, described his film as the story of 'unlikely heroes.' Indeed, the focus of this intense experience was on the ordinary people who performed extraordinary acts in response to the horrific act of terrorism in Mumbai, India on November 26, 2008.The film traces the lives of the hotel guests and, above all, the considerate staff, who courageously worked together to fend off the assault during the long standoff inside the hotel. As indicated in the DVD extras segment, the filmmakers spent six months in interviewing survivors to learn the human side of the event. The result was the depiction of real people with the goal of conveying 'the resilience of the human spirit.'The DVD offered interviews with cast members who were dedicated to accurately portraying the events and, in the process, paying tribute to the those who survived and those whose lives were lost. One especially memorable character was the young Sikh man played by Dev Patel, a hotel waiter, who was relentless in trying to save the guests. The hotel chef, who ran a world-class restaurant, was another of the decent and kind heroes. Armie Hammer plays an American architect, who becomes separated from his wife and child, then rises to the occasion to try to save them. The human stories were at the core of the drama.The film underscored the untold damage that a group of ten terrorists can inflict on innocent citizens. The cowardly young men and their demented mentor tended to blend together as a single sinister force. But within twenty-one months, the magnificent Raj Hotel in Mumbai was back on its feet, demonstrating how acts of terror will always be defeated often by human dignity and resolve.",Null,2,13,20 June 2019
Midsommar," A Midsommar Night's Dream...or Nightmare
","This reviewer gave Ari Aster's film 'Hereditary' the rating of 5, and 'Midsommar' merits the same mark for the same reasons. In the bonus track of the DVD of 'Midsommar,' Aster describes his goals of wanting to leave audiences 'moved, unsettled, and confused' through the experience of 'an adult fairy tale.' But he could have achieved those goals without the long, protracted build-ups to the ritualistic scenes at the heart of the experience.Ostensibly set in Sweden but filmed in Hungary, 'Midsommar' makes use of a large, open field that was converted into the village in which an ancient Scandinavian cult practices its rites unimpeded by the constraints of modern civilization. The action unfolds primarily through the perspective of Dani Ardor, a young woman who has experienced the traumatic loss of family members. She then travels with her boyfriend Christian to Sweden where they will partake of summer 'festivities' built around the June solstice and the customs of the Harga in the small village. But after they arrive and participate along with the cult, it would appear that Dani is being thrown from the frying pan into the fire.In the extras segment of the DVD, writer-director Aster observed that he wrote the screenplay for 'Midsommar' in response to a personal crisis in his life after a painful break-up. But the self-indulgence of the film went too far in stringing out the mundane activities of the village and an arty approach to the horror genre. In the interviews of cast and crew, it was apparent that the film personnel admired the auteur style of Aster. But the cast seemed to bristle at the limitations they felt from not having greater artistic license of their own in this meticulously choreographed pageant. Everyone seemed to move out of the way for Aster to take charge so that he could exorcise his personal demons.The reactions of Dani to the bizarre conditions of her new environment seemed ambivalent at best. She never seemed to take a liking to the cult experience until the very end, when her reactions seemed forced and not believable. An alternative and more realistic portrayal of Dani would have been closer to Dorothy in the land of Oz, trying her best to remind herself that 'there's no place like home.' Instead, the little May Queen gleefully accepts a pagan dormitory as her new home, yet needs sleeping pills at night. As she admires her handiwork in the violent ritual practices of old, she had to realized like Dorothy that it was a long way to come from Kansas for that cathartic experience and that it now may not be easy to get back home.",Null,2,2,7 November 2019
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," A Most Disappointing and Shallow Screenplay!
","'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' is one of the more overrated films of the past year. At best, one may say that the concept and screenplay are 'clever.' But the idea of remapping memory and the unethical human erasers removing the painful experiences was a shallow one. It is unfortunate that two fine performances by Jim Carrey and Kate Wislet were wasted in this film. The best scene was their initial meeting where we actually saw a believable and interesting relationship unfold. In the combination of Winslet's quirky character and the mild-mannered Carrey, I was reminded of a much superior film and screenplay in 'The Sterile Cuckoo.' With the outstanding dialogue and unforgettable performance of Liza Minnelli, the film actually shed light on human relationships and the emotional pain of breakups. By contrast, 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' was no more than a glorified gimmick. The film's title comes from the English poet Alexander Pope.

La La Land," 'And the Loser is....long pause.....Gimme the Envelope, Warren.....'La La Land!''
","'La La Land' has obviously resonated with film-goers. With a $30 million budget, the film has taken in over $440 million in international box office receipts. But the question that must be asked how does 'La La Land' compare with other film musicals? Arguably, the answer is: not very well.One of the joys of the older musicals is the ability to enjoy watching Judy Garlands films over and over. It would be difficult to avoid using the fast forward clicker in a reviewing of 'La La Land.' In the tradition of the multiple film versions of 'A Star is Born,' the musicals would also offer a social commentary on the insider world of Hollywood. Indeed, that is the goal of 'La La Land,' which seems to suggest that one can live out one's dreams in Hollywood, but it might take a toll on one's personal life. What a difference this is from the serious and indeed tragic tone in 'A Star is Born,' especially in the Judy Garland-James Mason version.Another major shortcoming of 'La La Land' was in the music. While there were several nice songs, it was painfully apparent that Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone did not have much range in their voices. Much of the pacing of the film was labored, and the narrative never made clear why Sebastian and Mia drifted apart at the precise moment when they were on the threshold of success in their careers.The heart and soul of 'La La Land' was in the romance. Yet the chemistry between Gosling and Stone was not terrific. And it was never made clear precisely when the characters fell in love. Sebastian was extremely callous to Mia when she was about to give him a compliment after a song he played in the restaurant. The filmmakers had the obligation to make the relationship believable and organic. One of the taglines of the characters came in describing 'the mess we make.' But parts of this film were also a bit messy.'La La Land' was clearly intended as a romantic fable. One underrated musical fantasy that might be just as good is Francis Ford Coppola's 'One From the Heart' (1981) that had more depth and imagination than 'La La Land.'",Null,2,5,29 April 2017
Mama," Standard Occult Film: No Innovations and No Insights
","'Mama' was a well-directed film in the thriller/horror style. With Jessica Chastain and the excellent cast, the film was watchable, especially with the interesting camera angles and set-ups of director Andrés Muschietti.The story focuses on the two young daughters of a businessman, who loses his fortune, goes made, kills his partners and his ex-spouse, then kidnaps the two children. When he drives his car off the road in an isolated mountain area, the man and the children take refuge in a cabin.It appears as though the father is about to take the lives of his children, but he himself is killed by the supernatural spirit of 'Mama,' who is the ghost of Edith Brennan, a mental asylum patient from the late 1800s, who escaped from the asylum and killed her child. Her perturbed spirit now takes over the lives of the two little girls and will apparently stop at nothing in killing others to keep them under her control.While the filmmakers evoked an eerie atmosphere, the film was filled with clichés. 'Mama' recycles familiar conventions, such as killing anyone who is a threat. Such bystanders as the curious psychiatrist and the overly possessive aunt are de facto targets of elimination. The film's ending was especially disappointing. SPOILER ALERT FOLLOWS: It was most disappointing that the neediest and most vulnerable child, Lily, is the one who is taken away by Mama in perpetuity. How depressing! While the entire cast performed admirably, the material never rose above a standard cinematic foray into the supernatural.",Null,0,0,13 February 2016
Snowden," Snowden: Lost in the World of George Orwell
","'Snowden' is directed by Oliver Stone with a stylish approach to a story that could have been written by George Orwell. Stone transports the audience visually into the world of underground security facilities and inside the computers themselves. The result is the nightmare of a national power elite that controls human freedom and civil liberties not by the Constitution, but by modern technology.Joseph Gordon-Levitt is outstanding the role of the self-taught computer prodigy Edward Snowden. Gordon-Levitt hits all the right notes in bringing complexity and an arc of development to an idealistic young man, who throughout his young career and his whistleblowing experience is naive about his goal of making a difference in the world.There is a stunning scene in the home stretch of the film when Snowden is having a conversation with his CIA mentor, Corbin O'Brian, who is brilliantly played by Rhys Ifans. It is no coincidence that the fictional character O'Brian is the namesake of the villain of Orwell's dystopian novel '1984,' who is also called O'Brien. At the beginning of the scene it is appears that O'Brian and Snowden are in the same room. But as the dialogue progresses, it becomes clear that O'Brian is speaking to Snowden on a large projection screen, informing the young man that he has essentially used the technology Snowden has helped to perfect to inform on the personal life of Snowden's girlfriend. The chilling effect of the scene is that of recreating Orwell's concept of 'Big Brother.'Another strength of the film was the thoughtful screenplay that effectively portrayed Snowden in his own words in conversation with journalist Glenn Greenwald and documentary filmmaker Laura Poitras. There was a cinéma vérité approach to the story that seemed perfect for the film's theme of the abuses of the law by the United States government.'Snowden' is a story that needs to be told. The unanswered question of the film is whether or not the case of Edward Snowden will bring about reform. Can we get some sanity in the uses of technology in the intelligence community?

The story draws upon the legendary lost treasure of the medieval Knights Templar filtered through the Freemasons, the Founding Fathers, and three generations of the fictional Gates family, as played by Christopher Plummer, Jon Voigt, and Nicholas Cage. The film follows Cage's Ben Gates in a lifetime quest for the Templar treasure. Ben's search takes him to Washington, D.C. where he finds himself in the predicament of stealing the Declaration of Independence in order to learn precious clues and prevent the priceless document from falling into the hands of the film's villains.In an interview following the film's premiere on cable television, Nicholas Cage called the plot 'an absurd concept.' Yet for the most part, the film delivered two hours of solid action entertainment. While the script could have been more sophisticated, 'National Treasure' nonetheless succeeded with the likable Cage backed up with a fine supporting cast.

","'Sicario' is a violent, unpleasant, hopelessly confused action picture caught in between a standard revenge drama and a socially relevant film.The main problem is the lack of sympathetic characters, especially the main role of FBI agent Kate Macer (Emily Blunt). Throughout the film, Blunt's character is lost in the vicious world of illegal government ops led by the cocky CIA operative Matt Graver (Josh Brolin). As with so many events in American history of the past half century, covert operations are rationalized by the dictum 'the ends justify the means.' If the filmmakers wanted to raise awareness of such vital issues as immigration and drug wars, they did not succeed.Nearly all of the characters were one-dimensional in what would typically be the norm for a made-for-television movie. The most interesting role is that of a violent revenge-driven mercenary named Alejandro (Benicio del Toro). SPOILER ALERT FOLLOWS: In the penultimate scene of the film, Kate is ordered at gunpoint by Alejandro to sign a document stipulating that all of the covert activities she has witnessed were legal.

After a horrific shooting of civilians in Pittsburgh, Reacher shows up at the conjunction of the Monongahela, Ohio, and Allegheny Rivers to track down leads.Reacher works closely with a female defense attorney played by Rosamund Pike, who is representing a former army sharpshooter accused of the crime. Reacher instantly smells something fishy, and begins to weave together a conspiracy theory about an innocent man. There is a romantic undercurrent in the relationship of the attorney and Reacher that never blossoms in the film.A number of the supporting roles are memorable, including Alexia Fast's character Sandy, who should have listened to Reacher's advice to get out of town. There is also Robert Duvall in a star turn as the crusty, old 'Gunny,' who comes to the assistance of Reacher.

The Da Vinci Code," It's Easy to Unlock This 'Da Vinci Code': Ron Howard's Film Is a Winner!
","Dan Brown's international bestseller 'The Da Vinci Code' has enjoyed phenomenal success because it taps into a wellspring of so many different and fascinating topics. The novel touches upon the early history of Christianity, the mysteries of the medieval Knights Templar society, numerology, and, above all, the archetype of the Grail Quest. The strength of Ron Howard's film lies in its integrity of striving to be faithful to Dan Brown's novel. The fidelity is apparent in each of the following areas:SCREENPLAY: Akiva Goldsman's script includes nearly all of the major scenes from the novel. To his credit, Goldsman provides dialogue on the Knights Templar, Mary Magdelene, Leonardo's 'Last Supper' mural and other details from the novel. DIRECTION: Ron Howard's stylish approach to the film includes interesting camera angles, especially in the aerial shots of such great location sites as the Louvre in the Paris and the Rosslyn chapel in Scotland. It was clear that Howard wanted not merely an action picture, but a leisurely paced retelling of Dan Brown's story. There was also the thoughtful use of close-ups in the more intimate moments with a brilliant analytical scene dissecting the controversial 'chalice' apparent in Leonardo's 'Last Supper.'CINEMATOGRAPHY: Overall, the film was appropriately dark and moody. The flashback sequences were shot in a grainy style that contrasted with the action-packed story of Robert Langdon and Sophie Neveu. Salvatore Totino deserves the highest praise for his tasteful yet imaginative camera work.ACTING: Tom Hanks was not overly charismatic as Robert Langdon. But that is precisely the bookish Everyman who is the protagonist of Dan Brown's novel. As Sophie, Audrey Tatou was more dynamic than Robert, as appropriate to her character as well; there was a sparking and even radiant quality to this young performer. The supporting cast was solid with Jean Reno especially successful in developing multiple layers of characterization in the morally conflicted detective Bezu Fache. Perhaps most memorably, Ian McKellen delivers a star turn as the scholar Leigh Teabing.Over twenty years ago, Umberto Eco's novel 'The Name of the Rose' was the equivalent in its time of Dan Brown's 'The Da Vinci Code.' The subsequent film version of Eco's story was a disappointment in its attempt to equal the success of the novel version of 'The Name of the Rose.' In the case of Ron Howard's film version of 'The Da Vinci Code,' however, not only does the film do justice to the novel, but in many respects it is better!",Null,182,367,19 May 2006

It is a great parody of the pretentious nature of the film industry.Like Ed Wood, Tommy Wiseau gained notoriety because he was so bad as a film artist. 'The Disaster Artist' works closely to the making of the amateur film 'The Room,' which was self-produced by Wiseau and garnered the distinction of being 'the Citizen Kane of bad movies.'James Franco is great as the Wiseau character, and the ensemble cast seemed to be having a ball in the making of the film. The DVD includes a number of bonus tracks with the cast discussing the project. One of the points that was made is that it takes excellent actors to recreate truly bad performances, like those of 'The Room.' The company was stellar in pulling off this challenge; they generated a truly infectious humor in the making of that horrible script. The payoff comes when the final product is screened to a live audience. As Franco indicated in the bonus segment, the goal of the film was to 'recreate something that was done so poorly.'

But because the dialogue was so insipid, it would have been possible to turn off the sound and simply watch the story unfold visually without missing a beat.What this film needed was snappy banter and witty one-upsmanship between the two leads.

American Made," Barry Seal: A Creature of the CIA
","In most biographical accounts of Adler Berriman 'Barry' Seal (July 16, 1939 - February 19, 1986), the narrative will describe Barry as a drug runner for the notorious Medellin Cartel of Pablo Escobar in Colombia. 'American Made' is successful in probing deeper into Seal's life story to shift the focus to his role in the so-called Iran-Contra Affair of the 1980s.Tom Cruise plays Barry Seal as a fun-loving American soldier of fortune...with the emphasis on the word 'fortune.' Seal is apolitical and is always on the lookout for a new angle into making money through his dare-devil flying skills. Seal became a contract agent for the CIA, taking surveillance photos in Nicaragua at the time when the Sandinistas were the duly elected national government. The film makes it clear that in the early years of the Reagan administration, a secret task force working out of the White House began to actively support a coup of the Nicaraguan government by supplying arms and training the insurgents to topple the Sandinista government. After the debacle in Vietnam and the Watergate scandal, Congress and the American people demanded more accountability from its government in adventurism abroad. But as implied in the film, Ronald Reagan was personally aware of the plot to overthrow the Sandinistas early in his first term in office and long before his Alzheimer's disability could be used as an excuse for him not 'remembering.'In its episodic style, the film is rather clumsy as it skips around in time and develops multiple subplots. But it is most successful when it focuses on the political machinations that first bring Barry Seal into the fold of the CIA in illegal arms shipments, until he is eventually betrayed when the clandestine government operation begins to implode. This is an important human story that included good research into Seal's peripatetic life by the filmmakers. One of the most fascinating parts of the film was the improbable creation of an illegal training base for the training of the Contras on American soil in Mena, Arkansas. Seal served in transporting the rebels to Mena at the behest of the CIA. The filmmakers skillfully weave documentary footage of Oliver North's behind-the-scenes role in the convoluted swap of arms for hostages in the two-pronged goal of freeing Americans being held in Iran while supporting the Contras in Nicaragua. The outlandish training site in Mena was part of the broader secret operation.The Iran-Contra Affair has never been thoroughly examined by historians, and this film goes a long way in exposing the events as they unfolded in the early 1980s. The only missing part of the story in the film was how the CIA was indirectly responsible for the sale of millions of dollars worth of cocaine to Americans, especially in the beleaguered distinct of south Los Angeles, resulting in the illicit funding of the Contras and the broader addiction of Americans to cocaine. That story was uncovered by investigative reporter Gary Webb and is the subject of a good film entitled 'Kill the Messenger. Taken together, 'American Made' and 'Kill the Messenger' tell a story that is rarely mentioned in the mainstream media or historians. And the deaths of Gary Webb and Barry Seal have an eerie and deeply troubling similarity.",Null,1,3,4 January 2018
Steve Jobs," One-Dimensional Character Profile
","Despite the earnest performance of Michael Fassbender in the role of Steve Jobs, this film was no more successful that the previous failed biopic starring Ashton Kutcher.The main problems were in scripting and direction. The film's opening scene depicted Steve Jobs in a heated conversation just before taking the stage to deliver one of his famous product promotions for Apple. Incredibly, the film simply recycled arguments and tantrums that occurred before the product launches.In direction, the actors were forced to overlap their dialogue. It was not only difficult to follow the arguments, but it was unbelievable that the characters would sustain such rapid-fire banter. In life, people occasionally do interrupt one another. In the case of the this film, nearly the entire screenplay was performed with dialogue overlap.In interpreting the character of Steve Jobs, it was unfortunate that the emphasis was on the insensitive side of Jobs. There was no attempt to tap into the creativity and the soul of the man. It would be like making a film about Thomas Edison with only nonstop haranguing of his family and employees.The mercurial side of Steve Jobs is so well documented that the film turned into a cliché.

Joker," The Joker is Wild!
","There are moments in 'Joker' when the central character, Arthur 'Happy' Fleck, reflects on how miserable he is. He acknowledges that 'all I have are negative thoughts,' and he consistently recognizes how the outside world is cruel, insensitive, and decaying from within, due the loss of a moral compass.Is the bleak depiction of Gotham City, the world that Joker helps to destroy through anarchy, may lie one of the reasons why 'Joker' earned over $1 billion in box office receipts: audiences have a direct, visceral reaction to the film's ugly environment. A central image in the film is the 'super rats' that have infested Gotham City. The rats are enabled by another metaphor in the heaps of garbage that litter the streets. It is hard not to see a parallel with the current state of Los Angeles and San Francisco.One of the most fascinating characters in the film is Thomas Wayne, the man who Arthur believes at one point was his long-lost father. Arthur sought out Mr. Wayne, hoping for a little compassion. For his efforts, Arthur received only more abuse and the knowledge that his mother was a pathological liar and had horribly abused him after she adopted him. Still, the film turns on the insensitive treatment of Arthur by Mr. Wayne, who thinks of him as nothing more than one of the blue collar workers he calls 'clowns.' In 2016, a former politician referred to the same crowd as 'deplorables.'Another interesting character is the late-night television host and Arthur's idol, Murray Franklin. But any bond of trust between the two characters is destroyed when Franklin mocks Arthur's stand-up routine at Pogo's and invites him on the show to humiliate him even more. The film's best scene was Arthur's appearance on one of Franklin's programs. In the bonus track of the DVD, 'Joker's' director, Todd Phillips, described how actor Joaquin Phoenix gave him a myriad number of different takes for Arthur's dynamic entrance on Franklin's show.A shortcoming of Phoenix's performance was his interpretation of Arthur's laugh. The primary character trait of Arthur is the laugh, which works in counterpoint to his melancholy. But the laugh sounded like the actor's laugh, as opposed to coming out of the character's soul. The 'laughing fits' should have been much more painful and disturbing for both Arthur and the characters around him.While the musical score of 'Joker' has received acclaim, the thundering, epic sounds and the protracted musical interludes added to the mood, but slowed down the pacing of the film. Phillips' direction was at its best in the excellent locations and the gritty style that recalled the underbelly of New York captured in 'The French Connection.' Both films are compelling works of cinema. But 'The French Connection' is the one that will stand the test of time.",Null,1,1,8 January 2020
Man on Fire," Creasy: The Michelangelo of Assassins
","Denzel Washington is always watchable and compelling. In 'Man on Fire,' he plays a character named Creasy, a former secret ops assassin who is hired as a bodyguard to protect the young daughter of a wealthy couple in Mexico. At the time, Creasy is down on his luck, battling alcoholism and depression. While he reads the Bible and knows scriptural passages by heart, it turns out that the little girl named Pita (wise beyond her years) brings Creasy out of his funk. From the outset, the film's premise is that Pita will be kidnapped and Creasy's skills as an assassin will be the main interest of the film. According to Creasy's friend Rayburn (played by a portly Christopher Walken), 'Creasy's art is death, and he is about to paint his masterpiece.' The best part of the film is the banter between Creasy and Pita. In the chauffeuring and the homework sessions, it is clear that these two characters formed a human bonding that resonated with lively, engaging dialogue. Unfortunately, the film turns into a high-tech version of 'Death Wish' with the Michelangelo of assassins proceeding through a string of brutal vendettas. The film is definitely not a promotional travelogue for Mexico; the only Mexican character with any ethical human values was Rachel Ticotin's journalist. For this story, was it really necessary to have 146 minutes filled with so many sleazy characters and violent scenes? And why wasn't there an explanation of the cause of the depression of Creasy, filling in the gaps of the mystery of his past. The film was skillfully and stylishly directed, and there was a strong supporting cast. But every time they mentioned Creasy's name, it sounded as if they were saying 'Greasy.' Denzel Washington is one of the finest actors of this era. But he deserves better film projects than this one.",Null,1,3,6 March 2005
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," TV-Style Skits Do Not Add Up to a Good Film
","I took the advice of an IMDb user who recommended sitting through the closing credits of 'Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy.' Unfortunately, the outtakes running through the credits were not funny, and neither was this film.I realize that Will Ferrell is a popular television personality and comedian. His best comic impersonation has been a dead-on portrait of James Lipton, the interviewer-host of 'Inside the Actors Studio.' But the 'Anchorman' film reveals the limitations of Ferrell in both screen writing and in acting. From start to finish, the film was shallow and the comic moments were uninspired.The one breath of fresh air in this lackluster film was the performance of Christina Applegate. Her comic timing was superb and, above all, she was the only performer who was convincing as a TV newscaster. But her character was not well developed in a script that was obviously intended as a star vehicle for Ferrell as Ron Bugundy. Lost in this mess of a film was the important point that in the 1970s there were significant female journalists in the media, such as Jessica Savitch, who paved the way for women news anchors. Ironically, the most competent scene in the film was when the four male newscasters sang a popular love song from the 1970s. Obviously, those four actors were better suited for a barbershop quartet than for a team of television newscasters.",Null,5,10,10 July 2005
12 Strong," 'It's Kind of Like the Apollo Program'
","'12 Strong' tells the true story of the courageous special forces unit ODA 595, who arrived in Uzbekistan on October 16, 2001, then engaged in battle with the Taliban in the first major confrontation of the American the military combat troops in Afghanistan in the post-9/11 world. In its handling of the dramatic material, the film owes a great debt to the 'Why We Fight' propaganda films of Frank Capra during World War II, especially in one of the film's captions that claims with no small sense of hyperbole that 'this was one of the U. S. military's most stunning achievements.' The film opens with the familiar string of events that spawned the 'war on terror': the first attack on the World Trade Center in 1993, Nairobi in 1998, the battleship Cole in 2000, and, of course, the tragic events of September 11, 2001. There is an interesting sequence of still frames with Vladimir Putin and captions suggesting to his counterpart George W. Bush that 'something big' was being planned shortly before 9/11.The balance of the film depicts the brave Green Berets of ODA 595, who become 'horse soldiers' after linking up with a medieval-style warlord, 'General' Abdul Rashid Dostum, with the goal of capturing the strategic city of Mazar-i-Sharif. Following the assassination of the Afghan Northern Alliance leader Ahmad Shah Massoud, there is a power vacuum in the Afghan leadership, with Al-Qaeda filling the vacuum. Only a miraculous victory at Mazar-i-Sharif will stem the tide of Al-Quaeda.The film's action builds to the horrific fight that took place in the strategic Tiangi Gap, the choke point en route to Mazar-i-Sharif. It was there that Captain Mitch Nelson, his fellow Green Berets, and the small contingent led by General Dostum were able to fend off the Al-Qaeda, with assistance from American air strikes. This was the scene in which Chief Petty Officer Hal Spencer, severely wounded by a suicide bomber feigning a surrender, had imagined would be an experience that would be 'kind of like the Apollo program.' But this non-conventional war that later turned into a hopeless quagmire bore no resemblance to a space launch. As observed by the grizzled warlord Dostum, 'there are no 'right choices' here. This is Afghanistan.'Despite the heroics of the horse soldiers, America's war with Afghanistan has continued in a perpetual struggle lasting more than fifteen years with no voice in the decision-making process from the American people. While the screenwriters offer a few token references to Afghanistan as the 'graveyard of empires,' the true nightmare of American involvement is never conveyed in this stirring, 'feel good' film. The reality of the Horse Soldiers was that the courageous men of ODA 595 returned home to no fanfare. While a statue of a horse soldier was dedicated on the site of the new World Trade Center in 2012, the true face of the war is not the men of of ODA 595, but that of Pat Tillman, a genuine hero killed accidentally by his own men while serving with futility in Afghanistan, graveyard of empires.",Null,1,4,6 May 2018
Hitch," Sprezzatura!!!
","The Italian concept of 'sprezzatura' was the grace and nonchalance in social manners that led to success in love, as described in the 16th century manual 'The Courtier.' The film 'Hitch' is worth watching for the embodiment of the 'sprezzzatura' concept in the dynamic performance of Will Smith.Smith plays the character of Alex 'Hitch' Hitchens, who is a professional dating consultant to those short on luck and confidence. The best scenes are when Hitch coaches the painfully shy and maladroit Albert in his quest to win the heart of a New York socialite and in Hitch's own attraction to Sara and a surprise for her when visiting Ellis Island. In these scenes, Smith is supported with good work from Kevin James and Eva Mendes. But this film is driven by the charm and winsome personality of Smith.From start to finish, Smith rises above the average comic script to make 'Hitch' an eminently watchable and entertaining film. I do not believe there is another actor working today who is capable of delivering the charisma and the perfect timing with the comic moments like Will Smith in this film. And his secret is in the 'sprezzatura'!",Null,0,0,17 December 2005
Arrival," Abbott & Costello Meet Creatures From Another World!
","'Arrival' was a thoughtful and especially well-scripted science fiction film. The concept was not only clever, but ingenious and imaginative.I appears that the basic premise of the film is similar to 'The War of the Worlds.' But around the middle of the film, the dynamic changes to allow us to think about whether advanced life could visit our planet for a noble purpose.Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner are both excellent in the major roles. Playing two university professors, their characters are the key figures in communicating with the two aliens, humorously named Abbott and Costello.The strength of the film was in developing a human side of the story. The subplot of flashbacks (or 'flashforwards') was essential in developing the film's theme about the 'gift' of the aliens.In this regard, the film's ending could have provided a much stronger denouement about the main topic of language and the implications of Adams's character unlocking the secrets of the aliens' complicated writing system. The human potential of the gift was far-reaching. Yet it was not apparent at all whether the deeply flawed human race would use the gift for the benefit or the harm to our planet.",Null,1,7,15 February 2017
The Terminal," Is Hollywood Running Out of Ideas for Good Films?????
","In one of the few memorable lines of dialogue from 'The Terminal,' the character played by Catherine Zeta-Jones asks Tom Hanks's character Victor, 'Just tell me the truth. Did you escape from an institution?' The same question might be posed to the screenwriters, director, and producers of the lackluster film 'The Terminal.'First, we have the setting of the film, an airline terminal that is closer to a shopping mall than an airport. Then, we have an airport security crew that is no more competent than the hotel casino staff of 'Ocean's Eleven.' Then, we have a gestapo-like security administrator (played by Stanley Tucci) who detains a decent man at the airport and forces him to live for months in the airline terminal. Viktor then proceeds to 'move into' the terminal, tearing apart the permanent seating; turning off the electricity; and reconstructing whole sections of the airport with his skills as a builder and contractor.Was this story supposed to be funny? Was this film intended as one of Steven Spielberg's parables and 'feel good' films? The premise was not funny, and the response elicited was not heart-warming. The one potential breath of fresh air in the film was the character of the flight attendant, as played by Zeta-Jones. But even her character was not likable. After befriending Viktor, she then apparently opts for an adulterous affair with a silver-haired pilot, whose face we never see.In sum, the main idea for this film was preposterous, and the film was not very well executed. It was not a realistic portrayal of the JFK airport, including the personnel, the travelers, and the security team. The plot lacked realism, humor, and depth of characterization. Based upon this film experience, I would conjecture that Hollywood is struggling to come up with vibrant ideas for films. In the past year, I have seen better films that were made for cable with much smaller budgets and much more artistry than the shallow film experience of 'The Terminal.'",Null,1,3,20 June 2005
The Big Short," The Amoral Side of America
","'The Big Short' is a good film that offers insights into the economic collapse of 2008. The perspective of the film is from a group of wise investors who recognized the coming collapse and in effect bet against the brokerage firms, banks, and mortgage industry. The dialogue is crisp and lively, and the male-dominated cast handles the pace deftly.The theme that emerges from the film is the greed that consumes nearly every character. Even the savvy investors who recognize the fraudulent practices are motivated primarily to gain for themselves on the collapse. The most interesting role is Mark, as played by Steve Carell, who comes the closest to a character with a conscience. Due to the suicide of his brother, there is a greater personal dimension to Mark than the other characters, who remain fairly one-dimensional.The film goes so far as to suggest that the problems at the heart of the 2007 crash have not been remedied, and the cycle of corruption has started anew. For this reason alone, the film is worthwhile viewing.",Null,1,1,18 March 2016
Mother!," Apocalypse Now
","There is a moment in 'Mother!' in which the protagonist whom we only know as 'mother,' lets slip into the conversation the word 'apocalypse.' That word conveys the gist of what this flawed and at times nauseating horror film moves towards.Jennifer Lawrence is outstanding in the mother role, as she confronts the nightmare of her husband's obsession for the creative process in his world as a writer. The large house that is shared by mother and the writer is invaded by the creatures from his imagination that will end in his best-selling books.The film was successful in demonstrating the lack of boundaries that exist between the writer and his wife, as he allows the characters to take over their lives and she refuses to say 'no' until it is too late. 'The poet says it's everybody's house,' remarks one of the numerous interlopers who ruin the life of mother. And the film moves forward to its inevitably apocalypse.On the other hand, the message of the film was strung out in too many violent and ghoulish actions. The birthing of mother's baby and the ensuing cannibalism were over-the-top and completely unnecessary for the filmmakers to make their main point. The film needed streamlining and the ability to use economy, as opposed to repetition of similar scenes. The best part was actually the minimalist opening scene in which it was apparent that the husband was far more interested in his crazed fan than his young wife. 'Mother!' would have been a stronger and more profound film without the excessive violence and the pretentious and labored scenes in the final hour.",Null,0,0,23 December 2017
The Greatest Showman," Phineas Taylor Barnum and the Horatio Alger Myth
","In the bonus track of the DVD of 'The Greatest Showman,' the director, who is a specialist in music videos, asserted that the music was 'the heart and soul of the film.' At the same time, he continued, 'we wanted it to feel classical.' Unfortunately, the musical score for this film did not have any sort of classical feel. It was purely contemporary music and rather uninspiring. In fact, all of the musical numbers tended to sound the same.With Hugh Jackman, supported by a fine ensemble cast, the character interpretation of the promoter P. T. Barnum was engaging. The screenplay sought to unfold the nineteenth-century Horatio Alger myth of a little street urchin's rise to riches through industry and perseverance. But the self-made man theme became caught up in a personal drama of Barnum's insecurity as the son of the tailor, who never overcame his feeling of social inferiority.The film took Barnum through various stages in his entrepreneurial career. Stage #1 was the Barnum Museum of natural history that was a flop. Even Barnum's young daughter recognized that his museum was lifeless.Stage #2 was his attempt at creating a 'curiosity' show with a conglomeration of human 'oddities' that he recruited. The filmmakers sought unconvincingly to turn Barnum's creative idea into the theme of diversity and the universal brotherhood of man.Stage #3 included the legitimate acts that Barnum developed in his circus. It is not clear what the fictional playwright character Philip Carlyle contributed to this stage, other than to fall in love with the trapeze artist and give the film a romantic subplot.Stage #4 was the time when Barnum sought to become 'artistic' in producing a prestigious touring show starring Miss Jenny Lind ('The Swedish Nightingale'). This subplot was strained when Miss Lind, who felt a kinship with the insecure Barnum, implausibly cancelled her tour because, apparently, Barnum would not sleep with her. Stage #5: The famed Barnum & Bailey tent show. The film was unsuccessful in attempting to turn Barnum into a kind of Citizen Kane, wherein we are instructed into his lost 'Rosebud' from his youth. The Barnum of this film is depicted as a kid with a dream, driven by the creative impulse that 'men suffer more from imagining too little than too much.' The story of the historical P.T. Barnum is much more prosaic than the one depicted in this film. Barnum said famously that 'the noblest heart is that of making others happy.' Barnum's story was a uniquely American saga of a hustler, who tapped into the desires of Americans for entertainment and, more than anything, was motivated to make money....just like the hustlers who made this schlock film entitled 'The Greatest Showman'!",Null,10,18,26 April 2018
Ben-Hur," The Saga of Judah Ben-Hur
","On the surface, the classic 'Ben-Hur' is remembered for the dazzling chariot race featuring the grimacing Charlton Heston at the reins. But on a deeper level, this leisurely paced and nearly four-hour big-budget film is a great Christian tale.Based on the bestselling novel of Civil War general Lew Wallace and first published in 1880, 'Ben-Hur'is set in Judea at the time of Christ. Judah Ben-Hur is a patrician Jew, who comes into conflict with his childhood chum Messala, who becomes the Roman Tribune of Judea. An accident that kills a Roman consul implicates Judah, his mother, and his sister, leading to the imprisonment of the women and to the sentence of Judah as a galley slave.After Judah saves the life of another consul, Quintus Arrius, on the Roman ship, he is adopted as a Roman citizen. He becomes a skilled charioteer who figures in the famous chariot race in which Messala cheats during the race and is eventually trampled under the horses' hooves when he falls from his chariot. Of course, Judah is the winner.The film has an overt homoerotic level in the interactions of Messala and Judah. But it is Jack Hawkins as Quintus Arrius who steals the show, especially when he is gawking at the manly muscles of the galley slaves during their rowing exercises.The plot summary above fails to convey the principal mission of the film to tell the story of the Crucifixion. At a critical moment of his life, Judah Ben-Hur was befriended by a stranger who gave him water when he was near death. The stranger touches the life of Judah in a way that will promote love and healing in his family. Of course, the stranger is Jesus of Nazareth.Much of the Lew Wallace narrative is clumsy, especially the sequence when Judah's mother and sister become lepers and the love of Judah's life, Esther, refuses to reveal the truth to him. It is only the power of Jesus that eventually produces the miracle that will place love, instead of revenge, in the heart of Judah Ben-Hur.",Null,1,3,4 February 2017

Flight," Great Intensity, Character Development, and Dialogue
","Denzel Washington is terrific in the role of the swashbuckling airline pilot Whip Whitaker whose external demeanor masks his internal demons. While the film is noteworthy for the opening section of the airline crash, the more quiet scenes are the most memorable.There is a subdued, yet riveting, scene in the hospital when Whip meets a cancer patient and a young woman with a drug addiction. The dialogue was both well-written and well acted by the three performers. The cancer patient controls the conversation, subtly conveying that he has his 'act together' more than the other two characters. It is at this moment that we first recognize the damaged inner side of Whip that is contrary to his surface personae of the ace.Although it may not have been intended by the filmmakers, there was a revealing side of the film that depicted the government investigation of the plane crash. There was an efficacy about the team that resembled a military event on the scale of D-Day, including a general's platform and a pair of binoculars wielded by one of the officials. Why can't our government function this skillfully in all of its responsibilities to the people?The scenes set in the serenity of the farm owned by Whip's grandfather are effective in the dramatic tension evoked as Whip seeks to resist the temptation of alcohol. Throughout the film, the excellent supporting actors keep the pace brisk and always engaging. Don Cheadle is especially dynamic as the attorney with clearly divided feelings about his troubled client Whip.This film demonstrates that it is not necessary to have exclusively non-stop action, special effects, and daredevil antics worthy of an Eddie Rickenbacker.

Munich," Mr. Spielberg's 'Prayer for Peace'
","In an interview given shortly before the release of 'Munich,' director Steven Spielberg discussed his film in the context of world terror today, as follows: 'Somewhere inside all this intransigence, there has to be a prayer for peace.' I personally recall the tragic events of the 1972 Olympic games in Munich, as I had just graduated from college and was following closely the moving and graphic images on television, as described so vividly by newscasters Jim McKay and Peter Jennings. The opening scene of 'Munich' recreates the attack on the dormitory and the subsequent killing of the athletes at the airport. Those were ten minutes of taut and riveting drama.But the main dramatic impetus of 'Munich' is the retaliation on the Palestinian planners of the 'Black September' massacre. The strike force is led by the character Avner, a zealous and patriotic member of Israel's Mossad. Along with Eric Bana in the role of Avner, the entire cast of 'Munich' is superb. Geoffrey Rush is a standout as the Mossad handler of Avner, and in an all-too-brief scene, Lynn Cohen turns in a charismatic performance as Golda Meir.But 'Munich' is not a film to discuss in terms of star performances, and much credit should go to Tony Kushner and Eric Roth for the thoughtful ensemble screenplay. The most memorable moments in the film are those involving the hit team led by Avner. In the planning and carrying out of the assassinations by a small group of men, it becomes clear that the participants are no more than ordinary people who become obsessed with killing. Thus Avner, who would prefer the domestic world of living with his wife and newborn daughter, descends into a virtual state of madness as a result of the killing frenzy.The Greek poet Aeschylus wrote one of the most expressive works of literature on the theme of 'an eye for an eye' in the revenge trilogy 'Oresteia.' That epic work dramatizes the culmination of the long cycle of murder within the ill-fated House of Atreus in Greek mythology. The killings finally end when the goddess Athena establishes the law court in Athens to provide human justice, as opposed to blood vengeance. Orestes succumbs to the pursuit of the furies and spirals into madness. That was the precise tragic journey of Avner, as depicted in 'Munich.'Mr. Spielberg's concept of 'intransigence' gets to the heart of the matter in our own modern tragic experience. In the Oxford English Dictionary, the word intransigence is defined as 'uncompromising hostility; irreconcilability.' Like the 'Oresteia,' the film 'Munich' provides a balanced and powerful commentary on the human impulse of 'an eye for an eye' revenge. The ancient Greek concept of justice meant something like 'scale' or 'balance' used to resolve a seemingly irreconcilable conflict. The thoughtful and powerful film 'Munich' offers us the opportunity to meditate on this concept, not for the 5th century B.C. world of Aeschylus, but for our own.",Null,356,548,23 December 2005
Kingsman: The Secret Service," The First Film in the 'Kingsman' Franchise
","Based on the comic book 'The Secret Service,' the blockbuster film 'Kingsman' enjoyed tremendous popularity in its theatrical release. What is the appeal of this film that may lead to a 'Kingsman' franchise motion picture with endless sequels? First, there is the humor that transcends the typical James Bond suave and supremely confident British snobbery. Second, there is Colin Firth, who was perfect in the role of Harry Hart (or Galahad), who is the linchpin in the non-political secret organization of Kingsmen. Third, there is the outstanding cinematography that included well-chosen location filming in the UK.The film was neither a rip-off nor a parody of a James Bond film. It sought to distill the theme of overpopulation and global warning into a profound social commentary. It was in this area that the film foundered, especially with the cardboard cutout villain character. Although well performed by Samuel L. Jackson, the role was conceived an an over-the-top and nearly farcical character.An inadvertent revelation from the film is the theme of the loss of basic human values in the twenty-first century. The villainous Valentine was using technology to turn humans against one another in endless slaughter to reduce global population. But a casual glance at our world indicates that it would not take sophisticated technology to create a civilization in this kind of decline. Although the film is a hodgepodge of styles, it nonetheless raises provocative values about our world. Some of the scenes, such as the carnage in the church, were shocking.

Green Book," 'Green Book' is a 9-Star Restaurant
","In the bonus track of the DVD of 'Green Book,' the producers identified the movie's themes of 'friendship, love, and acceptance.' Those abstractions were complemented by a detailed and insightful portrayal of the Jim Crow laws portrayed in the America of late 1962.To navigate one's way through Jim Crow laws, African-Americans relied on a guide called the Green Book. The author of the book was Victor Hugo Green, who compiled a survival manuel for blacks traveling through the Deep South and seeking lodging and restaurants that would not exclude them from service. The book was carefully crafted as a comprehensive and invaluable resource entitled 'The Negro Motorist Green Book.'As a film, 'Green Book' hits all the right notes in the situations, character developments, and well-scripted dialogue. So many films fail it attempts to blend comedy and serious drama. This film is a model of unfolding a dramatic narrative with genuine moments of humor that evolve organically from realistically driven characters and situations. One of the most delightful moments was a discussion about music between Dr. Donald Shirley and Tony Lip. The conversation focuses on classical versus contemporary music, and Tony mispronounces the name Chopin as 'Joe Pan.' Dr. Shirley takes it in stride with a priceless, nonchalant reaction.In the bonus track of the DVD, the film was described as the story of 'two people from two very different worlds.' It was made all the more remarkable that the two principal characters bonded almost as brothers. This was made dynamic by the extraordinary performances of Vigo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali. As writer-producer Brian Currie observed in the bonus track, 'it all comes down to the good acting.'The final strength of the film was the music with the inimitable piano style of Dr. Shirley. In the bonus track of the DVD, Dr. Shirley was characterized as 'Liberace meets Beethoven,' which is a good description of the unique musical style. There was subtlety in all facets of this film, and the word 'virtuoso,' as used to describe Dr. Shirley is appropriate praise for everything about 'Green Book.'",Null,2,4,13 March 2019

Lasting in excess of two hours, the violence is nonstop, and the character development is non-existent.Keanu Reeves plays the role of John Wick, who, apparently, can speak Russian, Italian, ESL, and, to a lesser degree, the English language. His character is a robotic killer, who has a change of heart and wants to get out of the game. But Santino D'Antonio calls in his marker, torches Wick's house, and forces him to assassinate Santino's sister.The action moves from New York to Rome, where Wick is linked up by the Camorra organization for the necessary wardrobe and killing implements. He then goes on a journey through the catacombs to locate and murder Gianna D'Antonio. In the most gruesome scene of the film, Gianna slashes her wrists before she is shot in the head by Wick. In what follows for an interminable period, there is a killing spree as Wick makes his escape from the catacombs.The balance of the film is Wick on the run after Santino places a contract on his head in the amount of $7 million. There is no evidence of any law authorities either in New York or Rome, only the occasional sign in a subway that alerts bystanders to be on the lookout for any 'suspicious activity.' The suspicious activity takes the form of the sequence that is repeated over and over in the film: Wick mowing down groups of armed assailants who are hunting him.

Annihilation," This Film Gave Me the Shimmers
","The conceit of 'Annihilation' is that an alien force has landed on earth at the site of a lighthouse on a coastal national park. Over the course of three years, the aliens have created bizarre mutations in the flora and fauna of the park, turning it into a kind of Jurassic Park fairyland. The human military forces sent in to investigate have either been mutated into zombies or changed in a way that leads them to destroy each other, due to the wormlike aliens invading their bodies. The all-women Mission: Impossible team is to meet face to face with what the military has dubbed The Shimmer, which is the essence of Darwin run amok.A task force of five female scientists with military skills is sent to the park with the goal of reaching the lighthouse to discover what the true nature of the aliens. All five women have suffered personal losses in their lives and appear emotionally fragile as a paramilitary unit. They are led by Dr. Ventress, who is dying of cancer. One woman has in the past made an attempt on her life. Another is a recovered alcoholic. Yet another lost her daughter to leukemia and is emotionally scarred. And the biologist Lena has a husband who is a casualty of The Shimmer: he is the only soldier to return alive, but is clearly in an altered state.One of the themes that the filmmakers attempt to develop is how human beings are self-destructive creatures. This theme is apparent in the five women who are described in the film as 'damaged goods.' It is even apparent in the most stable of the characters, Lena, who was cheating on her husband with a colleague. Is it a coincidence that her husband is invaded by the aliens at a time when their marriage is crumbling from within? The pretentious nature of the film suggests that the alien life has refashioned planet earth as a 'prism' that internalizes characteristics of plant and animal life, replicating cells and spitting them out in new mutations, such as strange alligator, bear, and deer hybrids and plant life that resembles the Land of Oz. Lena's husband Kane observed that God made a mistake in his design of human DNA. But the filmmakers suggest that the aliens want to extract something from life on earth for their own purposes.The women's task force is divided in their goals as they approach the lighthouse. Dr. Ventress wants to 'face it.' Lena wants to 'fight it.' Josie wants to give in to it. Unwittingly, the film turns comic when Lena dukes it out with The Shimmer in an extended dance sequence, a 'pas de deux' that demonstrates that her adversary does not understand what exactly is a phosphorous grenade. As Lena confronts her 'doppelganger' in the lighthouse, one of the two dance partners is going to experience annihilation.

In many respects, the mop was one of the highlights of this film because it truly was a unique invention: efficient, durable, hygienic.Jennifer Lawrence is terrific as the tenacious inventor, who must deal with shady entrepreneurs and colleagues who undermine her efforts. But the film stretched credibility in the depiction of her family members who are both gullible and antagonistic to Joy. The father figure, as played by Robert DeNiro, was especially troubling in his mean-spirited and cruel treatment of his daughter. The character of the half-sister was simply determined to ruin Joy. And what about the mother, as played by Virginia Madsen? It was difficult to believe that she would be portrayed as negligent and reclusive, yet she begins a romantic relationship with the plumber! And all of these family members are living under the same roof!Overall, 'Joy' was a lightweight film that never made a strong statement about the American Dream or the cutthroat world of business. This was principally a showcase for the talents of Jennifer Lawrence, who carried the film on her shoulders from start to finish. She certainly sold me on the unique features of the mop!",Null,0,1,1 June 2016
Her," The Sad, Sad Case of Theo Twombley
","On the surface, 'Her' is a dystopian nightmare set in a future when human contact is being replaced by bots and 'Operational Systems.' But at its heart, the film is about right now where technology is already de-humanizing us on a daily basis.Some of the most effective scenes in the film were the filler scenes where we see bystanders talking and texting on their phones as they are completely oblivious to other people. Such is the case especially for the protagonist, Theo Twombley, whose career is a 'Miss Lonelyhearts' writer preparing fictitious letters to warm up the lives of those who have lost their way.Joaquin Phoenix is outstanding in the role of the Everyman protagonist Theo, whose live is changed when he strikes up a relationship with a computer-generated 'voice' that substitutes for real human contact. After completing a ridiculously short questionnaire, Theo is linked up to 'Samantha,' who proceeds to take over his life.This provocative film raises the essential question of whether we are running our technology, or if the gadgets have taken over our lives. It was fascinating to follow the thread of the conversations of Theo and Samantha and see how the voice was changing his life. From the schlub Theo's perspective, he may have felt that his life was changed for the better. But what was clear to him was that he was not in control. While Samantha may not have been physically present on the dance floor with Theo, it was she who was doing the leading.",Null,0,0,26 August 2019
The Nice Guys," Stupid, Stupid, Stupid
","'The Nice Guys' had pretensions to be a slapstick-style film like 'Naked Gun.' Unfortunately, it fell flat with a convoluted plot, weak laugh lines, and poor chemistry among the actors.Films like 'Naked Gun' or 'Airport' can be great fun, as they build farcical scenes around star actors playing inept cops, pilots, and criminals. But Russell Crowe and Ryan Gossling failed to meet the threshold of performing in the broad comic style. Their characters, who were two incompetent L.A. private eyes, were far too understated. They needed coaching in the broader style of acting.The scripting of 'The Nice Guys' also foundered on poorly delineated secondary roles, such as that of Kim Basinger, who plays the 'heavy' as the corrupt official from the Justice Department. Her scenes brought the film down to an even lower depth of dullness.The filmmakers should have started their work by simply taking the time to view the 'Naked Gun' series and to study how Zucker, Abrahams, and Zucker found the ability to put together a decent film farce.",Null,48,96,20 September 2016
Hacksaw Ridge," Desmond Doss--A Genuine War Hero
","The focus of 'Hacksaw Ridge' is on the Battle of Okinawa in May, 1945. It was there that Private Desmond T. Doss, a conscientious objector serving as a medic, distinguished himself for his valorous rescue of wounded soldiers.Andrew Garfield was excellent as Doss, and he was supported by an able ensemble of performers. Mel Gibson provided a sure hand in directing graphic battle sequences.The only weakness of this fine film was in the opening section that sought to offer exposition of Doss's childhood and family background. These early scenes were far too complex than they should have been. There was excessive use of flashback and simply too many of the domestic sequences. It was difficult even to follow the basic family relationships in the abusive Doss family.While it was important to show that young Doss was capable of applying a tourniquet and that he was a gentle, passive soul, the most important revelation about his abusive, drunken father did not even come until a flashback incorporated late into the film.Apart from the clumsy and over-written opening segment, 'Hacksaw Ridge' was a powerful and provocative war film.For film-goers who enjoyed this film, an intriguing film that was released concurrently is called 'Ithaca.' There are remarkable similarities in the approach of the two films to the impact of World War II on the home front.",Null,1,2,21 February 2017
Me Before You," Good British Tearjerker
","'Me Before You' includes lush cinematography and a variety of exciting locales for a well-photographed romantic film. The story is about a pair of star-crossed lovers who sadly met at the wrong time.Will Traynor, played stoically by Sam Claflin, is a wealthy playboy, who was paralyzed when struck by a motor bike. His well-intentioned parents hire a young woman to help care for Will, hoping that he will not choose to end his life with an assisted death.Louisa Clark is the helper, who desperately needs the job to support her unemployed parents. Of course, money is no longer the issue when it becomes clear that Will and Louisa are falling deeply in love. The major dramatic question is whether that bonding will be enough to restore the life force in Will.The actress who plays Louisa is a perky performer named Emilia Clarke. While there may be moments that are over-the-top in exuberance, the actress nonetheless conveys a bubbly, brimming-over-with-life quality that makes her a scene stealer throughout the film. If her ebullience is not enough, there are jaw-dropping, quirky costumes worn by Louisa that add to her colorful character.The scripting of 'Me Before You' was somewhat bland without truly scintillating dialogue. It was the standout performance of Emilia Clarke that made the film special. It would be difficult to imagine any other performer in this memorable role.",Null,2,2,29 September 2016
Macbeth," Superficial Treatment of a Classic
","This film adaptation of 'Macbeth' failed to engage due to the overwhelming understatement in Shakespeare's text. The actors mumbled their way through Shakespeare's brilliant verse and imagery. And the cut-and-paste treatment of the play truncated the great speeches and scenes. This was a Cliff's Notes version of 'Macbeth.' On the positive side, there was some great location filming with isolated, barren landscapes that evoked the true sense of medieval Scotland. But the restrained performances of the leads played by Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard made the film an exercise in overly subtle responses to a concatenation of violence. Where was the emotional life in this brutally violently narrative of history? Yet another curious artistic decision was the treatment of the supernatural. Once again, the filmmakers downplayed Macbeth's interaction with the Weird Sisters, as well as the banquet scene where Macbeth is visited by the Ghost of Banquo. It was as if the director was afraid that any histrionics would destroy the credibility of the character relationships.Viewers would be advised to revisit the acclaimed film version of 'Macbeth,' as directed by Roman Polanski in 1971. The artistic choices were broader and more creative, and Polanski had a way of making everything clear from Macbeth's visit to the witches to the botched assassination of Duncan to the descent into madness of the two protagonists. The more recent film never delved into the next to discover Shakespeare's profound insights into greed, power, and political assassination.",Null,1,1,21 February 2016
The Bourne Supremacy," Action Pacing is Superb!
","Most of us would reach for our reading glasses to study street maps of new cities and floor plans of strange buildings. Not so for Jason Bourne, as performed by Matt Damon in 'The Bourne Supremacy.' While running windsprints or recovering from gunshot wounds, Jason Bourne can read the fine-print maps, size up the routes and exits, and not miss a beat in extricating himself from any stress-filled situation. It is this lightning-like pacing that is at the core of success of 'The Bourne Supremacy.'Although the companion film 'The Bourne Identity' was directed by Paul Greengrass and 'The Bourne Supremacy' was directed by Doug Liman, the two films have a uniform style. This is most apparent in the daring auto chase sequences and the action-packed exits of Jason Bourne. I especially enjoy his abrupt departures from buildings, scaling the exterior walls and leaping across roofs to avoid his pursuers.Matt Damnon is ideally suited for the role of Jason Bourne. For this character, Damon has developed a screen persona that is a cross between Jimmy Stewart and Arnold Schwarzenegger. (He has the warmth, innocence, and charm of Stewart, and he is starting to develop the physique of Schwarzenegger.) It is difficult to imagine any other actor today who could bring as much to this role as Damon. The balance of the cast is superb with Brian Cox as the oily CIA veteran, Julia Stiles as the young operative, and the incomparable Joan Allen as the persistent CIA officer who is tenacious in getting to the bottom of things. The only performer I missed in this film was Franka Potente, who was so good in the original. For 'The Bourne Supremacy,' her appearance was reduced to a cameo.I watched this film on the Starz cable network, and at the end of the film, several 'deleted scenes' were shown. They were all scenes that revealed more about the interior state of the characters like a short sequence with Jason lying in the snow prior to confessing to a young woman in Moscow that he had been the assassin of both her parents. I would have appreciated more scenes like this one in the final cutting to slow down the breathless pace and provide more complete character developments. It was obvious that the filmmakers did not want to alter that breakneck pace. And in that area--the gripping suspense sustained for nearly two hours--the film cannot be faulted.",Null,2,4,12 June 2005
Sully," Sully is a Winner!
","One might debate why it is important to make a feature film about an event that has received so much attention in the media. The crash landing of a Charlotte bound US Airways flight out of LaGuardia ('Cactus 1549') on January 15, 2009, and the heroism of Capt. Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger have already been etched deeply into our collective consciousness. Still director Clint Eastwood vividly recreates the event and offers a good human touch to the story.Out of central casting, the film features Tom Hanks as Sully, Aaron Eckhart as the co-pilot, and Laura Linney as the long-suffering wife Lorrie. Hanks is especially believable as the sensitive yet unflappable pilot.The unique angle of the film is to focus on the follow-up scrutiny of the safety and transportation board that takes Sully to task on the split second decision that he made to land the plane in the East River. Should he have attempted to fly back to LaGuardia or try to have landed at Teterboro Airport?There was a fascinating set of simulations of the crash scene that ultimately vindicated Sully and his co-pilot. The simulations reveal the importance of the experience of the pilot, who was drawing on a lifetime of flying to respond to the 2009 emergency.Overall, this was a compelling and moving film experience that shed light on the complexity and air travel that we often take for granted as passengers. Kudos to the writer, director, and actors!",Null,0,0,28 December 2016
Cinderella Man," James J. Braddock: Gladiator of the Great Depression
","'Cinderella Man' deserves to be placed alongside other great biographical films dealing with the lives and times of great boxers. Such films include 'Raging Bull,' 'The Joe Louis Story,' 'Ali,' 'The Hurricane,' and 'Ring of Fire: The Emile Griffith Story.' These films share in common not just a documentary-like approach to boxing or a superficial biopic. They also portray the human side of a modern gladiator and the culture that produced him. In the case of 'Cinderella Man,' we are given a detailed and heart-rending portrait of the Great Depression in American. The story of the gentleman pugilist James J. Braddock is the backdrop to the larger drama of Americans' struggle in the 1930s.Russell Crowe provides a brilliant interpretation of Braddock, capturing the decency of a man whose career as a boxer would appear to have peaked at just the wrong time prior to the Crash of 1929. After that momentous event, Braddock's boxing went into decline just like the lives of millions of Americans. The scenes of Braddock and his family living in squalid conditions and with uncertainty about such basics as heat and electricity were carefully developed in the film. Renée Zellweger was outstanding as Mae, the caring but feisty wife of Braddock. Paul Giamatti was also excellent as Braddock's handler-manager, Joe Gould. Joe tries to keep up appearances by sporting fancy clothes. But in one revealing scene in the film when we see the interior of Joe's ostensibly swanky apartment, there is no fancy furniture other than a dowdy table and some flimsy deck chairs. Everyone is reeling from the Depression. In the depiction of the massive unemployment, the 'Hoovervilles' of the homeless residing in Central Park, and the desperate need for Americans for an optimistic icon like Braddock to raise their spirits, the film truly captured the tragedy of the Great American Depression.The film's director Ron Howard emphasized close-ups throughout the film with uneven results. In many of the boxing sequences, the close-ups and rapid editing made it difficult tell the fighters apart. The close-ups continued even into the domestic scenes and the outdoor sequences depicting Braddock working as a longshoreman. The film's dark cinematography conveyed the bleakness of the Depression years, but it worked against bringing out the buoyant spirit of Braddock himself and the optimism that he instilled in others. As a director, Howard's strength is not in film artistry or technique. As apparent in this and other films, his gift lies in narrative storytelling and the development of dramatic character.Indeed, the characters and the story were the strong points of 'Cinderella Man.' Much credit should go to Cliff Hollingsworth for a screenplay that included thoughtful dialogue, humor, and multi-dimensional characters. Daniel Orlandi also merits praise for the brilliant costumes that helped to recreate the period of the early 1930s.But the heart of this film experience is Russell Crowe's screen portrayal of Braddock. It was the colorful sportswriter and raconteur Damon Runyan who coined the nickname of 'Cinderella Man' for Braddock. However, the real James J. Braddock was more than lucky. It was his strength of character in and out of the ring that captivated America. One of the most moving scenes of the film was a heated argument between Braddock and his wife Mae where Braddock insists that even in the most difficult of times, he would refuse to be separated from his children. As a boxer, he was fearless. But he demonstrated even more courage in fighting for family valuesa lesson from which we can learn a great deal today in reflecting on this sensitive film.",Null,127,162,3 June 2005
The Martian," A Lackluster Retelling of Robinson Crusoe
","One of the most important works of literature in the Enlightenment, Daniel Defoe's 'Robinson Crusoe' (1722) tells the long story of a shipwrecked sailor on an island that in its isolation could have been the equivalent of the planet Mars in the era of Defoe.Three of the most memorable parts of the novel are recycled in Ridley Scott's big budget film 'The Martian.' The stranded astronaut, Mark Watney (Matt Damon), counts off the 'sols' or years on his wall calendar, just as Robinson Crusoe marks the passage of time on his island. Crusoe also buildings with great care a home in a cave. It is the abandoned spacecraft that becomes the domicile for Watney. Finally, Crusoe nurses along a plot of corn in his little garden, which ensures his survival. So too does Watney plant a bountiful crop of potatoes within his spacecraft! The first half of 'The Martian,' which works closely to Defoe's novel and depicts the survival skills of Watney, is the best portion of the film. Unfortunately, the second half lapses into a routine and overly sentimental plan of NASA to rescue the stranded astronaut, turning the film into a 'feel good' experience about NASA and American patriotism.But the film undoes itself with incompetence of the space crew that abandoned Watney in the first place. The inept NASA administrators and scientists are even outhustled by Chinese scientists, whose technology in rocket boosters allows them to play a key role in the rescue.While the cast is filled with good actors, including Jessica Chastain, Kate Mara, Jeff Daniels, and Chiwetel Ejiofor, the film by design is a vehicle for Matt Damon. Most of the other characters have throwaway lines or strained dramatic close-ups as the essence of their characters.Lengthy portions of Defoe's 'Robinson Crusoe' are boring because the intent of the author was to demonstrate the loneliness and slow passing of time on the island. By contrast, the long stretches of time spent alone on Mars are filled for Mark Watney by disco music! Even Watney loathes the sound tracks that were left behind by his commander. Unfortunately, the audience has to suffer right along with Watney. For audiences watching the film at home on DVD, be prepared to hit the mute button on your remote.",Null,1,5,9 February 2016
Law Abiding Citizen," Gallows Humor
","The strength of 'Law Abiding Citizen' is the great cinematography and the fine performances. The film is a thriller with the landscape of Philadelphia figuring prominently in the action. Jamie Foxx and Gerard Butler are outstanding as the savvy city prosecutor, Nice Rice, and the mastermind of a set of killings, Clyde Shelton.While the filmmakers were able to build good suspense in allowing the audience to slowly figure out how Clyde is engineering so many destructive acts from inside a prison, there were some flaws in the screenplay. Clyde was said to have a confederate, but that strand of the story was never resolved. Also, the ending did not seem in character for both Nick and Clyde. The screenwriter's imagination that was ingenious in the dastardly plots of Clyde failed him with the film's ending.One of the best scenes in the film was the courtroom drama in which Clyde demonstrated to the judge the hypocrisy of the court system. His banter with the judge was spellbinding as he very nearly walked out of the courtroom a free man, then abruptly changed the dynamic to ensure that he would be sent to prison. There was also a certain irony in Gerard Butler's transformation from the apparently mild-mannered Clyde into a monster. It was clear that there were intended moments of dark comedy, especially in the prison scenes that could best be described as 'gallows humor.'The film was made in 2009, prior to the enormous wave of film sequels and franchises. 'Law Abiding Citizen' had the potential for at least one good sequel if the film had remained true to the moral ambiguity of the two lead characters. But the unfortunate ending that rendered complex characters driven by competing ethical motivations into a standard good-versus-evil world view ended all hopes for another episode of law and order in Philly.",Null,0,1,4 July 2019
