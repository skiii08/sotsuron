The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Setting aside the 'Overrated' and 'Plagiarized' bias, you'll see a good movie.
","Looking at the surrounding reviews you will see how this thinking apparently interferes with people's objective criticism of a perfectly good and technically superior film. They ignore so much.Some fans of Japanese cinema have still been unable to forgive The Hunger Games' resemblance to Battle Royal. They miss out on the bevy of differences and the depth of the setting within The Hunger Games. However tantalizing the world within the movie may be, most reviewers are prone ignore Mockingjay Part 1's greatest strength: Lawrence. No, not Jennifer Lawrence, though she still plays the part well (albiet a tad too heavy handed). The director Francis Lawrence does a grand job of utilizing visual storytelling and cleverly grafting it in with the plot. Also, this is one of the best edited movies this year, next to Interstellar and Edge of Tomorrow. The soundtrack is notable and Lawrence expertly uses and properly represents the power of music in Mockingjay Part 1. Addressing the other common complaint - splitting the source material into two movies: Many condemning Part 1 as a shameless cash grab, they wearily buy a ticket and pout while maligning the talent, time, and money (yes, movies COST money) online by engaging in an aggressive campaign against this 'overrated' and 'plagiarized' series. This sort of pessimism will surely prevent anyone from enjoying the emotional effect of this story. In conclusion, this middle movie will be viewed more fondly once it is part of a box set.",8,87,189,22 November 2014
Collateral," Locked In and On Target
","I like to hand this movie to my friends and tell them this is one of my favorites. Their response is always something along the lines of 'But... It has Tom Cruise in it.' That fella sure does seem to be picking up momentum on the hate train. After watching this movie, I respect him. Still, he doesn't make this movie. It's the whole package. I liked it more than most, granted. But most people will agree that this movie is at least GOOD. Even today the film has a unique feel. Come to find out, this is because of the early all-digital shoot they did. On a Thomson Viper HD camera, I believe. Why does this matter? Shooting all digital back in 2004 was a feat in itself. But beyond that, they digitally adjusted the shoots to have a really natural field of color. The setting of nighttime LA is captured beautifully. This does have its downsides as sometimes graininess will show up. The DP does some nifty camera work. Its not so much a 'shaky-cam' as it is a 'pannycam(?)'... The camera likes to move itself. Its fun to watch and is really unusual.I've already mentioned Cruise's commendable role, but Jamie Foxx nailed his as well. The BEST thing about this movie is the uneasy relationship of their characters. The cautious interaction between them. How Cruise's killer is always trying to get his looser cabbie to talk and open up. Most of it comes back to the dialog, I suppose. Also worth mentioning is that Javier Bardem has a nice little role in here too. The most noticeable problem, after watching it a few times, lies in the pacing. Every time we get 2/3 through the movie I feel a lull. This was recognized in the editing. And they did the smartest move in the book. They rolled with it, and built up our expectations of the promise of violence set to the soothing, but volatile sound of Audioslave's 'Staring at the Sun'. Its may masterpiece to me, but certainly worth anyone's viewing. Don't let people's overreaction to supposed plot holes keep you from missing out of an excellent ride.",9,3,4,3 April 2014
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Reviewed in terms of Style, Story, and Substance.
","Style - Catchy effects and musical score. The overall presentation. Story - You know what that is. Substance - Outright or subliminal themes or messages.Continuing a budding film franchise is tricky work. Especially if the first project is considered a decent piece of cinema. The job is made much more difficult when the original director has absolutely nothing to do with the follow-up to his own film. Catching Fire is an excellent accomplishment for Francis Lawrence- the series current (and contractual) director. While Gary Ross, who handled the first film, made the responsible decision not to sign onto direct a sequel with a mere year-and-a-half's production time, Francis Lawrence made an equally wise choice by maintaining much of the style that Ross' instituted originally. There is still a shift in filmmaking style, but this is not a bad thing. In fact, I wish more series would allow a hand-off between competent individuals. It makes each installment feel more unique.There are no outright flaws in the visual effects. Explosions and creatures look as natural as ever and do not detract from the strong points of the film - the acting and architecture. Catching Fire broadens the scope of The Hunger Games, and we get to see much more of Districts 11, 12 and the Capitol. All is faithful to the original art, and is expertly elaborated on. The acting has also done nothing but improve, and thankfully, no cast members have been swapped. If anything is a much more noticeable improvement, it's that the musical score does contribute to the experience more than the first. While the books are much more focused on Katniss (being written as a First Person narrative), the movies utilize the opportunity to elaborate on the setting and story. If nothing else, the make it much more interesting while carefully avoiding contradictions with the source material. The Hunger Games was very contained in itself, revolving around District 12, the Training Center, and of course, The Games themselves. Catching Fire broadens the setting, progresses the story, and develops the characters - some more than others, but at least it covers good ground. The story successfully makes the jump from 'Katniss trying to survive through the Hunger Games', to; 'Katniss trying to kiss up to the government to stay alive'. Another underlying plot comes to the fore as full on civil war becomes unavoidable. Needless to say, that sounds super exciting.When the story arc takes our hero jumps from the role of gladiator to that of pop idol, we will not ask ourselves a lot of the moral question that the first film raised. When you go to a movie that is set in a world where kids killing kids is an acceptable pastime, you can't help but be bothered by that fact that you just paid money to watch it as well. Of course, the presentation is different, but it highlights the moral ambiguity of warfare and sanctioned killings. Catching Fire's storyline just doesn't prompt the same degree of deep moral reflections. However, we still have some subtle themes regarding politics and the media that one could read into when they watch Catching Fire. For whatever this movie might lack when compared to the original, it makes up for. In fact, most would agree that it surpasses The Hunger Games in most every way. I prefer to be happy with the fact that they are each different, but at the same time good. I'm thrilled that each movie has done its part toward turning a popular book series into a great film franchise.",9,1,24,25 November 2013
