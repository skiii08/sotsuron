Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I really, Really enjoyed this movie
","I found TPM to be quite satisfying considering the hype and the fact that it was written backwards (not entirely, but fleshed out after the movies that it proceeds).  In fact, I only had 2 major complaints about the movie. One was Jar Jar Binx, and that's just my personal opinion.  The other was the blatant attempt at making the war scenes less violent by using Droids. You can make any number of arguments about how that is a more intelligent and peaceful form of war (as if there was such a thing), but if that's the case, why did the empire use real people for storm troopers many years in the future?We are currently conducting a long term experiment with somebody who will be watching the movies _in order_, to see if they make sense.  (Any person who's watched Episodes IV, V, and VI knows who the dark shadow in the cloak is, and the fate of Anakin Skywalker.) All in all, I thought this was a very good movie.",7,0,0,25 June 1999
From Dusk Till Dawn," Kinda Fun, but no real substance
","When I watched FDTD, I didn't have any major expectations, and so I wasn't disappointed with the result.  It took me a bit to get a hold of the sudden plot shift.  For the most part there wasn't really anything that stuck with me, except for George Clooney's tattoo and the final shot of the movie. OTOH, this is a movie that I would certainly watch again.  Partly because I like Juliette Lewis (maybe that will give you a reference point on which to compare my opinion), but also because it's a good ride while it lasts. 
Don't go looking for deep meaning where there isn't one, you'll only come out feeling cheated.  Oh, and BTW, this movie really isn't for the weak of stomach. 
I give it 65%.",6,8,11,24 January 2000
