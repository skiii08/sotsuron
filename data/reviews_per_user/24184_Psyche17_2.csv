Marie Antoinette," Painted Like A Portrait and Just As Two-Dimensional
","There is a scene towards the end of Sophia Coppola's Marie Antoinette where Marie gives a standing ovation as the curtain falls at an opera only to look around to find unapplauding hands placed politely in laps and cold glares thrown in her direction. I imagine that Marie attending a screening of Coppola's bio-pic would produce similar results. Marie Antoinette does not play as a film of plot and intrigue, but as a series of portraits: Marie in society, Marie with husband, Marie accessorized, Marie gambling with friends, Marie with children, etc. While a portrait may hold special significance to whom it depicts, it will always struggle to hold the interest of the viewer without some kind of story.Coppola gives us a whiff of a story like a French perfume that fades in its poignancy after the first squirt. The main conflict of the film resides in the necessity of Marie Antoinette to produce an heir by the next in line to the throne, Louis XVI, who is less than sexually invigorated. While this storyline might have worked in the form of a raunchy comedy, for a two hour bio-pic drama, it does not produce the desired climax. Part of the problem, I think, comes from the fact that every character lacks arc and depth. Marie Antoinette's stunted state of superficiality is forgivable for accuracy's sake, but not a single supporting character proves him or herself noteworthy or compelling.Like any portrait by Velasquez, Rembrandt, or Da Vinci, Coppola succeeds in creating a picturesque, artistically drawn representation of Marie Antoinette's life. The setting, costumes, and cinematography are beautifully combined to bring a realism to the film that is unfortunately and inexcusably broken by the dissonant chord struck by the inclusion of modern music. Storming through the film's authenticity like the commoners through the Bastille is the distracting conglomeration of French, British, and American accents. I am usually forgiving of inaccurate dialects as long as they are consistent, but in a film centered around French royalty (with a few Austrians thrown in), the discrepancy of accents adds an inappropriate diversity to the company of otherwise homogenous characters.Compounding the problem of dialect are cringe-worthy line deliveries by Jason Schwartzman who seems unable to discern the difference between awkward sexual interaction and awkward acting. Though the intention of his characterization of Louis XVI is to be more or less socially incompetent, his diction betrays nothing more than a verbatim memorization of the script which only creates awkwardness in the audience whose solitary hope for his character is that he will put his prepositions in the right places. As I listened to him speak throughout the film, I found myself transported back against my will to my high school English class where fellow students struggled to read Hamlet aloud, pausing after every syllable of 'to be or not to be' in uncertainty over where to put the stress. Schwartzman's monotonous recitation of lines immensely less eloquent than Shakespeare's does not excuse, but rather draws excessive attention to his poor performance in this film. Kirsten Dunst is overall convincing as Marie Antoinette, but I do not see her as deserving much recognition come awards season.As I review this long list of grievances with the film, I cannot help but admit that I would have forgiven every last one of them had Coppola only given us the satisfaction of the guillotine scene. I even have a suggestion for the pop song to score it: Alice Cooper's 'Chop, Chop, Chop.'",5,2,4,21 October 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Really Bad Eggs
","The year 2003 marked the year in my life that I blew all my allowance money to go see Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl six times in the theatre, that I rented every old Johnny Depp movie I could get my hands on, that I taped any and all Johnny Depp TV appearances, and that I filled a scrapbook with magazine articles, quotes, and pictures of I think you can guess who. Johnny Depp's unprecedented performance of a Keith Richards and Pepe LePieu-channeling pirate anchored the success of Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl as perhaps one of the most beloved summer blockbusters to date. When I learned the sequel would not come out for another three years after the first film, I thought I would never be able to wait that long! I was right. By 2006, my Johnny Depp scrapbook had long since been shoved under my bed and the TV appearances had long since been taped over. When I bought my ticket for Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest, I wondered secretly if my infatuation would be rekindled. It wasn't.It's unfortunate that the most critical problem with PotC:DMC probably lies in the fact that Johnny Depp's performance can no longer be described as 'unprecedented,' seeing as it is just a re-hash of the character he coined in 2003. Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow radiated so brilliantly in the first film that it let the film's otherwise obvious flaws slide by unnoticed by the audience. PotC:DMC, however, is inundated with flaws to the point that not even Captain Jack can remain afloat.In PotC:DMC, Captain Jack is back, but he forgot to bring his wit and charisma. In the first film, it was so thrilling to watch as he ingeniously manipulated every situation, no matter how dire, to work to his advantage. In this film he wears funny face paint and makes lame rum jokes in incessant references to Curse of the Black Pearl. Jack Sparrow, why is your originality gone? It's a shame that one of the most innovative characters in recent cinematic history has become static and flat, unless you count a frantic shish kabob running across the screen as character development.Another crucial problem with this film is the main villain, Davey Jones. In the original, we had the marvelous Geoffrey Rush playing Barbossa free from the constraints of CGI disfigurement. While I don't presume to imply that Bill Nighy lacks Rush's acting skills (on the contrary, I've always enjoyed Bill Nighy's work), I do believe that the CGI inhibited him from giving a satisfying performance. While I understand that high-tech devices can be used to track the actor's facial movements, I can not for one second believe that a tentacle-faced cartoon could equal the expressiveness of a professional actor such as Nighy.The original Pirates had witty dialogue and colorful characters, PotC:DMC has the Kraken. One of the overlooked flaws of the first film was that it had about 30 minutes too much CGI-based action. PotC:DMC takes this flaw and tacks on another 15 minutes. This time, however, instead of clever quips and charm to off-set the intense action sequences, we get re-used jokes and references to the first film. Yes, Captain Jack is still rooting for Norrington, and I'm still rooting for Dead Man's Chest come up with one line of original dialogue.Part of the problem, I think, is that each of the three main characters spends too much time apart from others. Will Turner goes off on his own adventure aboard Davey Jones' ship where he meets his long lost father, Elizabeth escapes from jail and stows away on a merchant ship, and Captain Jack alternates between the company of each. It seems as though the relationships and interactions of the main characters are treated as after thoughts to the special effects and are given little time to develop on screen. The romance between Will and Elizabeth, which blossomed so beautifully in the first film, is destroyed by one or two provocative glances between Jack and Elizabeth and a compass that tells her what she wants. Is Elizabeth so fickle that a few weeks apart from her fiance√© could drive her into the arms of his sometimes-adversary? Did I miss something from the first film that I was supposed to pick up on? Was this love triangle really necessary, no matter how honest Elizabeth's motives in locking lips with Jack? On the up-side, if this movie succeeded in one thing, it was to get me excited for its third and final episode. Captain Jack Sparrow may not be able to shiver me timbers like he used to, but he's a good ol' friend and I can't just abandon him quite yet. PotC:DMC, in my opinion, was a sorry disappointment in comparison with its predecessor, but I think I feel a change in the winds says I. I have a feeling about the third film, just a feeling, but I think there's still a chance for redemption.",5,3,5,11 September 2006
