Miracle," Even though I knew the outcome, I still welled up at the end. An excellent movie!
","Kurt Russell has to be one of the most under-appreciated actors working today. For this part, he BECAME Herb Brooks. As for the movie, it's well-made, well-acted and extremely moving, even though you know the ending.Al Michaels' call still gives me chills every time I hear it. Seen in the context of the movie, which showed the mountain Brooks and team had to climb, it was even more powerful. One thing the director did well was the opening montage which focused on the time during which the 1980 Olympics occurred. This was post-Watergate America, suffering from Jimmy Carter's malaise. Against that backdrop, the tonic the US victory provided can be better understood for those too young to have lived through it.This is a movie to own and re-watch every so often. The DVD comes with additional footage of an ESPN interview with the real players. That's worth watching, too. This ranks up there with Field of Dreams as one of the best sports movies of all time.",10,1,1,14 July 2004
