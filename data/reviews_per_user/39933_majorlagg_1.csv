United 93," Pretty good film
","I saw this movie recently on DVD. I also saw Flight 93, the made for TV production. I am kinda partial to Flight 93 but found United 93 to be a very good film. Even though, you know what happens at the end, the movie is still suspenseful. My palms were sweaty as I waited for the inevitable take over of the plane.Hitchcock once said that the most suspenseful moments come when the audience knows whats about to happen.I was disappointed that the director left out Todd Beamer's prayer with the Verizon customer support person. It seemed that the only people praying were the bad guys. I hope the director wasn't trying to make a subtle point.",9,0,2,6 September 2006
