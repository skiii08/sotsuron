Vertigo," haunting, melancholic piece about obsession
","There are some negative comments evident in IMDB.  Despite the truly shameful naivety of some of them - are interesting to read, with the majority them highlighting some valid, albeit subjective, points. First and foremost, those not particular in tune with films pre-dating the 60s will perhaps find some of the situations and dialogue clunky.  I did, but like anything you merely have to become accustomed to it. 
Although the film may seem long and slow to some, I did not encounter such problems.  Rather, the dreamlike mood induced a hauntingly, melancholic, almost trance-like state for this viewer.  This I think is Vertigo's timeless appeal.  While Rear Window is arguably the better film, and enjoys greater technical direction, tighter story telling and pacing (as well as a wittier interplay between the two main leads), Vertigo delves into the subconcious and weaves its own unique spell on the viewer as we follow Scotty into obsession.Vertigo 'feels' like Mr Hitchcock's most personal film.  However I do think certain, curious individuals are reading too much into the piece, purely as an insight into Mr Hitchcocks character, particularly his fascination for (certain) blondes.  As Mr Hitchcock and his daughter will often attest, he was always concerned merely with cinema art as entertainment - and, that entertainment was always a figment of his imagination.To a uniquely, beautiful and obsessive creation 5/5",Null,2,3,14 November 2002
It's a Wonderful Life," How does this communicate to you?
","Before watching this I had the same misconceptions as everyone else about films from this golden age and especially this festive flick.  The film fortunately put such doubts to rest.  Many will argue it is too sentimental, while partly true, such scenes are handled with the utmost care and NEVER feel cheap.  Being from this current generation of cynical drones, this film to me, was a revelation. Capra fills each scene with such feeling and character that one cannot help but feel slightly moved. The film has the perfect cast especially the immortal Jimmy Stewart and the ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS Donna Reed (underrated, underrated).  While labelled as a feel good christmas movie, such a label is disrespectful.  The film encompasses a variety of values and emotions, from family, faith, hope, love, aspirations, despair to many others.  Although it is a universal film and there are some lighthearted periods, there are also scenes of depression and unhappiness(exploiting the talent of Stewart perfectly).  If this is a happy, festive film, then it is the most depressing one I have ever seen. Every scene is excellently realised by a director at the pinacle of his craft and furnished with layers of detail and feeling.  The film is also complemented by the best cast ever assembled (yep beating all others I think in my opinion).  Every performance is refreshing and unlike 99% of all other golden age films from this era, the acting and dialogue is wonderfully accomplished and refreshing and has not dated in the least.  Many polls do not consider this to be the greatest film ever after all it has to be something 'cool' something for the 'twenty something generation', something like the Godfather or Pulp Fiction.  It effortless surpasses my previous favourites: Shawshank Redemption, Magnolia, Chungking Express, The Truman Show and Memento.  These films while excellent do not touch me PERSONALLY in the same way as It's a Wonderful Life.  They do not ignite the same sense of joy and euphoria, that little 'magic'.  This is cinematic utopia, a film which breaks free from the boundaries of motion entertainment and into the realms of your emotional senses.  And it feels nice.",10,1,5,24 January 2002
The Truman Show," underrated, magnificent
","This films very underrated - reminds me of 'Harvey' (a favourite of Carry's if I'm not wrong). The film effortless juggles between satire and poignancy. With a great and somewhat quite fantastical premise, there was always the chance the film would not be delivered to its full potential. But credit to Weir, he has constructed one the standout american films of the nineties; One which deserves more recognition than it already recieves from within those stuck-up critical circles. The film is not the most in depth around by measure of symbolism and other such what nots, but this is preferred since it is thankfully devoid of the sort of seriousness and pretension that these elitist critics often hold in such high regard. Films shouldn't have to be Bergman or Fellini, to be considered great. Greatness comes in other forms, not just in charting human nature etc. (although its certainly essential to have a wide variety, as with all things in life). Similarities to Hitchcock then, in that its glorious entertainment fused with subtle humour and intelligence, and brought into fruition with great aplomb. This is a film which will linger in your mind long after you leave the theatre. Carrey's performance is great. Famously billed as his first great serious performance. I was not too convinced on first viewing, since he plays it a bit tongue in cheek at times. But on further viewings his performance, and that of the cast is now recognised by this individual, as extremely understated in its brilliance - complementing the tone of the film perfectly, as it elicits subtle laughs as well as more touching moments of poignancy (complemented by a breathtaking musical score).
Truman is certainly one of the most likeably characters since Mr George Bailey himself and that in itself is a feat achieved. By the dramatically moving and nailbaiting denouement, you too will be cheering Truman on. Plus he gets the girl.RECOMMENDED WITH EXTREME CONVICTION.",Null,0,1,16 January 2003
The Thin Red Line," Can't believe the negative comments
","I believe this film has got bad ratings due to the fact it is a war picture -  most people expect action, action, action or CHEAP melodramatic moments for emotional involvement i.e. every soldier bites the dust during the course of the film except the main star(hmm Saving Private Ryan). Furthermore, the influx of new war films of late, have led to many revisiting past ones such as the Thin Red Line.  This is where the negative comments stem from since Thin Red Line deviates so much from the other batch of war films.  It is a film more about human soul and nature, set in the backdrop of war rather than an out an out 'war' film with a set goal (e.g. secure the fort!).  For the record I have seen it with 2 other people and they didn't get it, so they didn't like it.  The Thin Red Line is like fine wine, you have to taste enough of (and a variety of) it before you can really appreciate a fine one.  And this is one.  This film is so much more. This was the first film I saw from Malick.  I have since seen Days of Heaven, and that is even more accomplished as an example of poetic moving imagery (although not as good as The Thin Red Line since it lacks the any real substance, intelligence, characterisation - merely a series of beautiful moving images, albeit extroadinary ones).  I must say Malick is an outstanding visionary. The Thin Red Line is magnificently shot with its long sweeping shots and panoramic views. Expect a certain stillness and beautiful calmness to the cinematography, which complements the somewhat philosophical nature of the film.  However Malick does make use of a more frantic camera motions and movements during the 'cleanup' of the japanese camp - but not just for the sake of it (i.e. the MTV style so prevalent today), but to emphasise the sheer terror, chaos, brutality of the battle.  It makes you question the justification and futility of such barbaric acts of war.  This is in stark contrast to his more measured thoughtful direction of the hill siege for example.  Thank goodness the more thoughtfully still and relaxed art of directing, is still around.  Others have argued the film is pretentious.  Me? I hate pretension in films if abused.  I'm an Bergman fan but even he is sometimes prone to too much 'arty poetic' talk in his films.  I hated Apocalypse Now since the actors would break in a long boring philosophical speeches at every opportunity. The film is very overrated and not a patch on The Thin Red Line.  Many find this an enigmatic statement since I love philosophy, plus Apocalypse Now and the Thin Red Line are considered to be from the same mold of film.  For me, Apocalypse Now seemed more like an out of control binge on pointless philosophy just for the sake of it.  Not all of it really added to the film (thats just me).  In the Thin Red Line I could connect to the philosophy narratives, they revealed insights into the psyches and feelings of its characters, rather than just being there to make the film 'philosophical'. They elicited feelings and emotions from its viewers (from me at least). The Thin Red Line is never manipulative in the same ways that Saving Private Ryan is (a film which has its detractors from those stuck up elitist circle of critics I detest so much; but for all its negatives its still an accomplished film).Clearly Malick put his heart and soul into this film (his first for 20 years) to craft a profound, unforgettable and dreamlike piece of melancholic, poetic art.  It may not have the most realism.  It may be unconventional in both its narrative and plot, but those who understand it, those who yearn something a little different, something with a little more intelligence will find that it is a film which resonates a sense of euphoria through the mind and soul.  Incidently others who like this should try the other James Jones film 'From Here to Eternity' (53).  Not the same type of film (in a philosophical sense), although like The Thin Red Line its a war film concentrating on its characters rather than the war.  Its a prime e.g. of a Hollywood film, but its an absolutely CRACKING one with the same type of theme, i.e. a somewhat rebellious soldier who, while treated/punished bad by the army still loves it.  Also planned is 'Whistle' form Sidney Lumet.  Not yet released but considered part of a trilogy to From Here to Eternity and The Thin Red Line. Can't wait.",10,2,5,16 January 2003
