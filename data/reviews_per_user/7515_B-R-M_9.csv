The Avengers," Review: Marvel´s The Avengers
","Initiating the first crossover of Marvel's cinematic universe, as well as for The Avengers, the first installment brings us more than action and a whole solid story like Iron Man could be.
The film tells us an alliance of Supehéroess that unite to defeat Loki, Thor's evil brother, which the latter had to defeat in his solo film.
The film has a well-carried narrative, the CGI does not feel that it clashes during the film, it is intelligent to bring us an antagonist rather than entertaining as others of other films, and has a coherent reason why it does evil, while the performances They are still cool as in their films, the characters have these characteristics which make it more realistic and nothing flat, which is half questionable is the soundtrack, I mean, this is NOT very important in this genre, but placarñas, it was necessary to repeat the same Music sequence like 12 times??? ...
Although out of it, it remains in Baundcrrack and is not distracting or annoying, but prestandole attention, questionable.
While in other sections, it feels pleasant and serves, Tony is still arrogant but aware of everything that is happening, and saves the world carrying the missile that was going to destroy NY sending it to a kind of portal where the ¨ ¨ henchmen ¨ of Loki.
Thor is still arrogant as in his film, but this one concentrates on the same Loki and what he can cause.
While the Hulk has a bigger role than normal, now does not destroy things because if or destructive things, now is right and does well without feeling generic.
Much of this battle takes place in Midtown Manhattan, where the sharpest sequences involve the huge snake-lizard-wavy snake dragon Machine from Loki, which seems to have a mind of its own and is backed by countless coils. At Any given moment, a Avenger flies into the mouth of this leviathan and penetrates its full length, emerging at the end of the business. You Won't see that in 'The Human Centipede.''Comic-Con nerds will have multiple orgasms,' predicts critic David Edelstein in New York magazine, confirming something he had vaguely suspected about them. If you're right, it's time for the desperately needed movies to reeducate the nerds in the joys of sex. 'The Avengers' is well done by Joss Whedon, with style and energy. It Gives your fans exactly what they want. If It's exactly what they deserve, it's moot.
Anyway, it's a good movie anyway. 3.5/5",7,0,0,30 March 2019
The Incredible Hulk," Review: The Incredible Hulk
","It Is Obvious that the Hulk of 2003 was a film that many considered weak.
Hulk of 2008, instead, We Have a good interpretation of Edward Norton as a man who desperately does not want to become the Hulk, and goes to Brazil to study under a control of the breath to control his anger, and not become the Green Man, Shrek (?. And we have Liv Tyler in the midst of shaky sympathy. Banner's Brazilian stay begins with an astonishing shot: from an aerial point of view, we fly higher and higher above one of the River hills, seeing hundreds, thousands of small houses built on top of each other, all scratching air.
This is the 'City of God.' In the neighborhood, and as far as I could see, we're seeing the real, not CGI. The director lets the filming run longer than any reasonable requirement of the plot; My bet is that he was as astonished as I am. And let it run because it's incredibly amazing. The scenes involving Banner in Brazil are well conceived, although when it accidentally contaminates a bottled soda with its blood, the film does not really deal with the consequences when consuming the drink. United States. The contamination gives general Ross his clue to the whereabouts of Banner, and Army troops raze the hell of the City of God; Throughout the film, the general deploys his power of fire so recklessly that one wonders if he has a superior. , and if you ever have to account for the dozens, hundreds, thousands, who die while your boys are shooting at the Hulk without any favorable effect.
Enter Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth), a marine that general Ross recruits because he is more cruel and deadly than anyone. Blonsky leads the chase in Rio. Later, Dr. Samuel Sterns (Tim Blake Nelson), associate researcher of Banner, is forced to inject a little juice from Hulkie to Blonsky, preparing a titanic battle on the roof of Harlem between Hulk and Blonsky. And This battle, as I have suggested, is waged relentlessly, taking as our first victim our patience. 'Iron Man', the best spiritual Companion of this film, also ends with a clash between an original and a copycat, but involves two opponents who know who they are and why they are fighting.
When you put yourself to it, like a fictitious creature, the Incredible Hulk is as limited as a bad drunk. It Can be fun to be around when You're sober, but when You drink too much, You feel sorry for the boy.
By changes, the Hulk of 2008 is an improvement of the 2003, yes, but good movie? Well... No: C but it's decent. 3/5.",6,0,0,30 March 2019
Iron Man 2," Review: Iron Man 2
","Iron Man 2 pretends to be a better sequel than the failed attempts of these, but unfortunately it is not better... But... Is it bad?
Stark is sponsoring a Stark Exhibition at the New York World Fair site, and presents himself to appear in the Iron Man outfit and promises world peace. The Sand is full of fans. Imagine Steve Jobs announcing the iPad 3. But the problems are brewing. His rival Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) plans an army of rival iron suits. A congressional committee led by Fatuous Senator Stern (Garry Shandling) wants Stark to make Iron Man the exclusive property of the Department of Defense. And in Russia, the bitter Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) believes that Stark's father stole the secrets of Iron Man from his own father.Hammer hires Vanko to design a better outfit than Stark's, the two designs of the suits go to war, we have half an hour of sensational special effects and Bob is your uncle. But you also have a niece, sexy martial arts expert played by Scarlett Johansson, who can be more than she looks. The character was named Black Widow in the comics, never a good sign. Fighting next to Stark is his fellow lieutenant Colonel 'Rhodey' Rhodes (Don Cheadle); As they shoot through a blizzard of enemy missiles, they both find time to talk. How slow should a missile move if your friend has time to warn you to dodge it?The best CGI sequence in the film occurs in the middle, when Tony Stark decides to drive his own car in the Grand Prix of Monaco, and Ivan Vanko is fearless in the midst of the race, dressed as a perverted gladiator and wielding electric whips Who can cut a car in two Almost destroys Stark, which is so exciting that we forgot to ask how he knew Tony was driving his own car. It Is After this race that Hammer enters it.
Mickey Rourke gives us everything that Ivan Vanko could want, unless he had a third arm to give more space to tattoos. His Performance presents glimpses of his golden teeth in sad laughter and many grunts. Sam Rockwell gives an ironic comic performance like Hammer, a plaintive plaintive who seems to be crazy in the Super weapons business.
The peculiar performance of Robert Downey Jr. The superhero genre is full of good performances (mostly), but when it is there (as in 'Iron Man' and 'The Dark Knight'), that takes it to a level. Downey here gives us a Tony Stark who is more arrogant and more selfish than ever. Or, and here's the key, it seems to be.
You Want a sequel, you have a sequel. 'Iron Man 2', directed as the first of Jon Favreau, does the work. However, since both films have essentially the same arc of history, there are not many surprises, which made me wonder how the boys would survive inside those suits. Of Course, the suits are armoured, but their bodies are not. How Many dizzying falls, brutal blows and stealthy explosions can you survive without breaking all the bones in your body? I was Just asking. ' At The end of a long day, those suits must be filled with bloody pulp.
Not to mention that I feel that, I don't know, could have been better explored as the first, it's obviously not better, but it's still a good sequel. 3.5/5.",7,0,0,30 March 2019
Spider-Man 2," Review: Spider-Man 2
","Definitely one of the best sequels in history.
Let's start with the negative points, which are few by the way, 1 of them is the fact of feeling even a little forced Peter's relationship with MJ, but at least, unlike the first, here's more pocisi about Peter's affection that MJ has.
And the last negative point is that they would have explained better why Peter loses his powers, as it is a key point to the plot and the development of the character in the film.
And because that's all the bad, since the script improves considerably, there is more than one reason to return to be Spidey, The villain of the film, Doctor Octupos, apart from being an entertaining and exciting villain, his reasons are better explored unlike the Green Goblin , and the truth the scene where he sacrificed himself to save the city and Spider-Man, Harry discovers that Peter is Spider-Man and begins to hate him for having ¨ killed his father ¨.
The special effects and the CGI improves considerably, now they are better pocisionados and the performances help in these, not for nothing was won a special effects award, it is entertaining and you will never be bored of this film, the scene of the train is memorable already That shows us that the Peter de Maguire deserved to return as Spider-Man in this film to help humanity (criminals rose by 75% after the disappearance of Spider-Man temporarily)
The performances help the characters understanding their situations and problems, they are more human thanks to the actions of the actors, as Maguire that improves his performance of Peter Parker/Spider-Man in this film unlike his particular and rare performance in the First, the rest stands out for the same reasons.
It is an entertaining and exciting film for the fans more passionate about the Trepamuros, it is understandable and enjoyable for adults, is by far the best film of Spider-Man (nor into the spiderver that quotes is the best nor arrives).
There Are moviegoers who lose the superhero movies, and I can not blame them, but I confess a weakness for the genre. I liked the two movies of 'Crow' and 'Daredevil', 'Hulk' and 'X2: X-Men United', but not enough to recommend them to friends who do not like or do not understand the comics. ' Spider-Man 2 'is in another category: It is a real, pure-blooded and intelligent film, with qualities even for those who have no idea who Stan Lee is. It Is A superhero movie for people who are not going to watch superhero movies, and for those who do, is the most yearning.
While watching Raimi and his writers cut through the threads of history, he savored the classic hand: The film gives all the weight to all its elements, keeps them alive, builds with such skill that we care all the time. In A smaller film of this genre, we usually get animated for the action scenes, but we go into the dialogue. Here both are kept alive, and dialogue is more about emotion, love and values, and less about explanations of the inexplicable (it is a little clear that Spider-Man never finds out why his ability to throw cobwebs sometimes fails him).
Thing that is half is forgiven with the last negative point I said.
Anyway, it's a very long Sequel.

Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Review: Captain America: The Winter Soldier
","First, the sequel to our American cap is just one thing.
Questionable.
Apart from having a heavy and slow pace, and having an antagonist out of nowhere, Captain America, the Winter Soldier lacks the narrative established in the first film of the CAP, the script is mediocre, I mean, if they were going to make the cap doing winter acrobatics of the Macho hard hit, minimal would have done something more or less similar to Iron Man 2, but there is nothing here.
The CGI while it's good, well, the characters and the script stop to want, likewise, the sequences where buildings are destroyed (for example, in the Falcon scene) is re forced and nothing exciting, the final battle of Cap and Bucky does not have the taste of fresh air as It was with the Red Skull, nor if Bucky is explored well, it feels forced that only why your friend in quotes abandoned you because of you is very foolish, or if you have a good background to make the character interesting, the action sequence is still had Endo the CGI, the narrative blur of the characters, and the script, leaves the movie very bad, not counting that is boring both objectively and personally, there is almost nothing interesting, the final battle is not exciting and less interesting than with the Red Skull with the first, the script is badly exploited knowing, that the sequels of Marvel are between good and decent, is boring and, no matter how much CGI has the movie (whether it is good or bad) if you do not have a good script and a good narrative of the per Characters, will be very bad, but unlike other sequels, this came out mediocre. 2.5/5.",5,3,5,30 March 2019
Spider-Man," Review: Spider-Man (2002)
","Apart from the disproportionate action by the annoying zooms, then, Spider-Man is a Film enjoyable, it is, the problem is its script half opplausado, (ie, medium incoherent), in the film is never explained in depth why Peter wants to be a Supehéroe Out of the fact about the murder of his uncle (who killed him tégnicamente by his fault) Likewise, the affection that has to MJ is re forced, the scenes seen in the movie never show the true affection that Peter has to MJ, (not counting the final scene that is Desprop Orcional first of all that was seen in the film) while, the villain is little memorable (something like the Largarto in the amazing but more mediocre) I say. If Norman Osborn wanted to escape the curse of the Green Goblin, minimum he has asked for help, (ask for help almost to his death, which makes the character a unibidimensional) or if you want to explore well his motives of remaining the Green Goblin, and his scene of death It is forced because it is not explored very well with its character, which makes it a moltiviero, (Sad scene with shoer) it was not necessary the fact to kill itself when trying to kill Spidey, the action is somewhat decent but annoying, when a character strikes makes a kind of Zoom, (This is shown in the final battle in the abandoned English).
Although on the other hand, Maguire does well to Spider-Man and knows the basics of the performance, what does not convince me are his facial expressions where they are half subrealists or make strange sounds (like one that makes in the final battle where the Green Goblin gives a blow and Spidey the M Walk away).
MJ I feel that it was wasted, I say, not explore much of the character beyond that has problems with his family and that is the love interest of our protagonist.
Norman is half unibidimensional, shows a lot, tells Little.
Cobwebs seem to be loosened by the effects that look somewhat false and are badly positioned.
However, and continuing with the character of Peter, then, is well developed seeing, of as it is questioned why it has to be a superhero, pity that this was not explored very well in depth, out of the murder of his uncle, therefore, 0 reasons to be spidey.

The Amazing Spider-Man," Review: The Amazing Spider-Man (2012)
","After the disappointment that was for many Spider-Man 3, the Spidey franchise was restarted, making this film, but, is it better than the 2002? YES, WHY???
First, unlike the film of the 2002, here is further explored why Peter has no parents and only teien his uncles, explain themselves better and there is more than one reason why Peter wants to be Spidey, which in the film of the 2002 was never well explained , this problem is solved, Peter, who is adapted from The Amazing comics, adapted well, but in a different way, since here Peter, instead of being a boy, who is doing badly with his classmates, here is more someone who wants to get away from the world , although it is forgivable, since in the same comics had friends like Gwen Stacy (who is a success in the film, as unlike MJ in the films of Raimi, here Gwen has more importance outside that is the love interest of Peter) MJ or Harry who did not begin a A good relationship with Peter, but over time it was getting better.
Meanwhile, the lizard/Curtis Connors was portrayed as a mediocre villain (like the Green Goblin who was a villain like mediocre form) because, well, Tégnicamente is not a villain because his same motives were not, but the solutions posed made to see Curtis A villain, not to mention that his motives are not very well explored.
The action is half disappeared, but is forgiven in bringing us a better plot and better character development is concerned, although the CGI used for action is slow, but makes sense and feels enjoyable and serves.
Meanwhile, the CGI used for the movie is Buenisimo (unlike the 2002 film, which was mediocre) combines well with the scenarios, are well positioned and although some scenes are re false (as when Parker is thrown into a building) but most Scenes are well positioned and excellently well worked.
While the OST, then, is half meh, unlike the 2002 that was more memorable, the OST of this film is not so memorable as in the saga of Raimi, but that goes that works for the scenes.
And Finally, the film has a slow pace to take an hour to better explain the character of Peter, why only have uncles and non-parents (although this is best used in the second) and why it should be Spider-Man.
The slow pace is forgiven for the aforementioned, Peter is better developed in this than in the 2002, (although when they killed his uncle, as much as this Peter and Raimi are well developed but Webb is better developed).
And in other circumstances, The relationship and Chemistry of Peter and Gwen in this film is better than Peter and MJ in Raimi, as apart from having better exploration in the characters, Gwen's father, Captain George Stacy, is the policeman who wants behind the bars the man Spider, making the relationship between these 2 difficult.
And when George dies in the hands of the Largarto in the final battle, for at least it makes sense, because George wants to protect his daughter in any way, even to tell Peter that promises him to take her out of his life (which Peter meets in this movie but Lamentablem It breaks in the second.
While with the performances, Andrew acts better to Peter as well as to Spider-Man, without making strange noises, until he studied the movement of the spiders to have a more realistic performance, and the truth if it feels that he is Spider-Man.
Meanwhile, Emma also does a good job as Gwen Stacy, as well as the rest of the film cast.
In short, it is better than Raimi alone for a little, many exaggerate that it is a bad film just because it is not his childhood or other nonsense, instead, is a good film that deserves more recognition.

Toy Story," Review: Toy Story
","It Is undoubtedly Toy Story, one of the most important animated films in history, not only for having started the 3d style in the same, also for being so influential.
One Day There is a great reorganization in this little world. The owner of the toy, named Andy, is birthday. Woody sends all the troops into a Bucket of Soldiers to spy on the developments on the ground floor, and they use a Playskool walkie-talkie to transmit the developments. Most alarming: The arrival at the scene of Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), a Space ranger.Buzz is the most endearing toy in the movie, because he doesn't like the joke. He Thinks he's a true space Ranger, temporarily abandoned during a crucial mission, and desperately goes to work to repair his spacecraft: The cardboard box he entered. There is a real shock at the end of the movie when He sees a TV commercial for himself, and he realizes that it is just a toy.The plot warms up when the human family decides to move, and Woody and Buzz are isolated from a service station with no idea how to get home. (It Gives a whole new turn to the situation when a toy says: 'I Am a lost toy!') And Then there's a terrifying interlude in Sid's bedroom, the terrible guy next door, who disarms his toys and remounts them as creatures of a nightmare. (Her long and suffering sister is forced to organize a tea party for headless dolls.)Seeing 'Toy Story,' I felt something of the same joy I felt during 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit.' Both Films disarm the universe of cinematographic images and re-assemble them, which allows us to see in a new way. 'Toy Story' is not as inventive in its plot or as clever in its ingenuity as 'Rabbit' or Disney animated films like 'Beauty and the Beast'; It'S more or less a film of friends transplanted to a new terrain. Your best pleasures are for your eyes. But what a good movie! Seeing the film, both objectively and personally, it feels pleasant the fact, being a simple plot coupled with a good performance in it, Dawn of a new era of film animation, which is based on the best of cartoons and reality , creating a world somewhere in between, where space not only bends, but breaks, creaks and appears, is important. 4/5",8,0,0,30 March 2019
Iron Man," Review: Iron Man
","Downey's performance is intriguing and unexpected. He Doesn't behave like most superheroes: he lacks psychic weight and gravity. Tony Stark has been created from the person Downey has created through many films: irreverent, Peculiar, self-critical, wise. The fact that Downey has permission to think and speak as he does while using all that hardware represents a bold decision on the part of the director, Jon Favreau. If I hadn't wanted that, I probably wouldn't have hired Downey. Downey is So comfortable with the dialogue of Tony Stark, so familiar that it sounds to come from him, that the script seems to have been dictated by the person of Downey.
There Are Some things that some actors can say with security on the screen, and other things that they can't. The person of Robert Downey Jr. Would find it difficult To get away with big and deep statements (in an 'entertainment', anyway, a more serious film like 'Zodiac' is another matter). Some superheroes speak in a kind of accented semi-formal prose, as if dictated to Bartlett's family appointments. Not Tony Stark. I Could talk that way and be Juno's uncle. ' Iron Man 'doesn't seem to know how seriously most superhero movies take themselves. If there is ingenuity in the dialogue, it is often assumed that the superhero does not know it. If There is ample humour, it usually belongs to the villain. What happens in 'Iron Man' However, is that sometimes we ask ourselves how seriously Stark takes it. He is frivolous in the face of disaster, casual on the brink of ruin.
I Think it's prudent for Favreau to position the rest of the characters on a more serious line. The cast of support wisely does not try to overcome it. Gwyneth Paltrow plays Pepper Potts as a woman who is seriously concerned that this fool commits suicide. Jeff Bridges makes Obadiah Stane one of the great superhero villains apparently plausibly concerned about the stock price. Terrence Howard, like Colonel Rhodes, is at all times a conventional straight arrow. What a horror show it would have been if everyone was tuned to Tony Stark's sardonic vibe. We Would Return to the World of Swingers (1996) which was written by Favreau.Another novelty of the film is that the enemy is not a conspiracy or a spy organization. Instead, it is reality in our own world today: armaments are spreading beyond the ability to control them. In Most films of this genre, the goal would be to create bigger and better weapons. It's only Tony Stark wants to disarm. It makes Him a superhero who can think, reason and draw moral conclusions, rather than one who recites common places
The film is mainly based on its special effects. When someone is not talking, something is hitting, making noise or putting gum. The Armored robotic suits used by Tony and Obadiah would stage fewer actors than Downey and Bridges; It is surprising how much those two gigantic iron men seem to reflect the personalities of men within them. Everything They do is absurd, of course, but they seem to be doing it, not the suits. Some of their moments have real grandeur, like when Tony tests his suit to see how high he will fly, and finally falls to the ground in a sequence that reminded me of a similar challenge in 'The Right Stuff.' The art direction is inspired by the original Marvel artists. The movie doesn't play Jack Kirby's drawings. and others, but it reproduces its feeling, a vision of enormity on a large scale, impeccable elegance, secret labs made not of nuts and screws but of... Views.
A lot of big budget f/x epics seem to abandon their stories when half an hour is missing, and they simply throw effects to the audience. This has such an ingenious storyline that it continues to work no matter how strong the impacts, how huge the explosions are. It'S an inspiration to give Tony that heart-saving device; He is vulnerable not only because Obadiah could destroy him, but because he could simply run out of juice.That leaves us, however, with a fundamental question at the end of the story: why should the ultimate weapon be humanoid in appearance? Why should he have two arms and two legs, and why does it matter if his face is frowning? In real-world competitions between combat machines, all elements of the design are based entirely on issues of how well they allow machines to attack, defend, recover, stand upright and overthrow their enemies. It'S irrelevant if they have conventional eyes or if those eyes narrow. It Doesn't matter if they have noses, because obviously their supply Oxygen is not obtained by breathing.The solution to these dilemmas is that armoured suits are seen as they do for totally cinematic reasons. The Wicked Iron Man should look like a petty machine. The Good man of iron must use the colors of the racing of the favorite sports cars of Tony Stark. It would Not be so much fun to see a fight scene between two refrigerators crossed with the leftovers of a boiler room.At the end of the day, it is Robert Downey Jr. Who drives the takeoff that separates him from most of the other superhero movies. You Hire an actor for his strengths, and Downey wouldn't be as strong as a powerful one-dimensional man. It Is Strong because it is smart, fast and fun, and because we feel that your public person masks deep private wounds. Based on that, Favreau found his film, and it's a good one. 4/5.",8,0,0,29 March 2019
