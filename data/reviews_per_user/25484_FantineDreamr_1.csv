E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," I love ET!
","ET is such an amazing movie. It shows how accepting everyone goes a long way! It all shows how attached kids become to their friends and pets. I love it so much! ET IS SO CUTE! I LOVE HIM! He bring a smile to my face. He is an amazing character and a unique one as well. When I first saw this movie, I was so scared of ET, but I watched it today...and I realized that I had nothing to be afraid of! Stephen Spielberg is a genius! This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I am going to show it to my children...cause its just that amazing! I hope that for all of you who have never seen this movie that you do see it cause it is an inspirational film and a fun one to watch with your kids.",10,2,4,7 November 2004
