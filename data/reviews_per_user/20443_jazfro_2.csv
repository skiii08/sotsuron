Blade Runner 2049," I feel bad for the soul and legacy of Philip K. Dick
","Could I rate this 0/10?
The original movie was an acceptable dumbing down of Dick's original story - which the author himself superficially validated before passing away. For those who are interested, there's a well researched TV documentary on his life.
Dick created worlds where a reality based on artificial intelligence would collapse in weird and dangerous ways. Read Ubik, The Man in the High Castle, Flow my Tears, and his other stories to get a taste. His inspiration was fuelled by drugs and deep personal and psychological issues -I am not a doctor or qualified expert, but I guess that nowadays, Dick would be diagnosed with some form of bipolar disorder -in the same way Vincent Van Gogh would.
Dick's worlds are full of irony and unusual perspectives on the human condition, he asks pointed 'what if?' questions and provides curve-ball answers that take us to unexpected places. If you have not read his work, before you pass judgement on this movie, please read a few of his books.
Evaluating this expensive and exquisitely produced pile of manure only by reference to the original Blade Runner movie would not do justice. Back in the days, Ridley Scott took a gamble on producing an expensive and edgy film -based on an even more disturbing story- that would re-set public expectations about Sci-Fi movies. 
My issue with the sequel is that what is left are the weakest bit of the original: the unexplained rain-fuelled darkness over LA due to climate change, the perceived threat of bio-engineered life and its economic exploitation.
These were not the core premises of Dick's story, which delved into the dark corners of what it means to be human. So all we're left with in the sequel is a dumbed-down story of emancipation that dares not fully embrace its premise (hence the inconsequential ending) or socio-political consequences, and just leaves us to ponder for three hours which of the characters is Rick Deckard's son or daughter: who cares??? 
There was so much potential for this story, the scale of the missed opportunity cannot be understated.
I would not lay the blame on the doorstep of the director, who did a good job to make the vast budget look good on the screen, but I am convinced that the army of scriptwriters and focus-group marketing minions have to shoulder some of the blame for the bland and ill-informed outcome. If Villeneuve had been given a decent story and a quarter of the money, maybe he would have directed a watchable movie.
As it stands, this is a horrible failure, and I can't see how a 'director's cut' would redeem it.",Null,3,7,27 December 2017
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," a flawed but entertaining drama
","Don't get fooled by the categorizations. This is not a crime thriller or a comedy. It's more like a classical greek drama, with violence, intrigue, pathos and comedy in equal parts.
Some of the parts are extremely well executed: the violence and comedy stand out, and Frances McDormand leads the way in both. As a grieving and p***ed-off mother who just lost her daughter to a rape/murder, she is emotional, forceful and displays the unhinged, seemingly calm, no-nonsense behavior of people who have nothing left to lose.
Other parts are less convincing: the intrigue is without an ending, and some of the pathos lacks believability. I was left wondering about the ending, and the late reconciliation between Mildred and Dixon did not convince me. 
The movie was helped along by good supporting cast appearances by Woody Harrelson, Peter Dinklage (whose character was under-developed) and Clarke Peters. 
Some themes of the movies touch on racism, exclusion, and male chauvinism, but the execution could have been more powerful.
Quite a few scenes stand out where Frances McDormand as Mildred tells her truth to the town (the police chief, the advertising guy, her ex, her son, and a few others) in a way that merges comedy and tragedy that was touching and funny at the same time. This for me was the memorable part of the movie.
Overall a watchable movie, but no masterpiece - and please forget the references about Fargo or other Coen brothers' movies: the tenor and perspective are different.",Null,2,5,7 January 2018
