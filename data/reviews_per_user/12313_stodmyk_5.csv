Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Ugh. 'Nuff said.
","Top ten reasons I gave this movie a rating of 4/10.10. It's too long.9. Even WITH the force, Yoda probably couldn't go from the muppet you see here to the cool *ss Jedi teacher we saw in Empire.8. Natalie Portman can act, but has for some reason decided not to.7. This is not supposed to be a comedy.6. Even if it were, Jar Jar is not funny.5. CGI battles don't look remotely realistic, even for sci-fi fantasy.4. Too much politicking, not enough action.3. A bazillion talented kid actors out there, and Lucas picks this little dork? This is Darth Vader, for cryin' out loud.2. Speaking of which, Darth Vader makes C3PO? Come ON...1. Three of the four rating points go to the VERY cool Darth Maul light sabre duels. The other one goes to Ewen MacGregor's excellent Alec Guinness impression.",4,1,2,7 October 2001
Moulin Rouge!," Director Baz Luhrmann is easily one of the most important filmmakers of our time
","Baz Luhrmann is a freakin' genius.The man behind the 1996 visual orgasm that was William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet has done it again. This time, he hasn't breathed a taste of modern life into the Bard, but rather an even deader art form: the cinematic musical.Yes, Woody Allen tried it a couple of years ago with Everyone Says I Love You. But while Allen's material hasn't felt fresh since well before he ever laid eyes on his step-daughter, Luhrmann has injected innumerable pop references into his ode to Paris circa 1899.A young writer named Christian (played by Ewan McGregor), new to gay Paree, falls for a courtesan named Satine (Nicole Kidman) upon his first visit to the outrageous club Moulin Rouge. Okay, so the metaphor in the movie can be a little obvious at times... The story from there is interesting, but incidental. As shot by Luhrmann, these two are so captivating a screen couple the remainder of the film could involve them singing about poor penmanship and it would be worth admission.McGregor is every bit the smoldering star he promised he'd turn out to be, and Kidman once and for all proves that she is perhaps the most photogenic woman on the face of the planet. Both turn in surprisingly good vocal performances, and have no trouble carrying this picture.Luhrmann smothers every scene in overwhelming colour; even his usage of sepiatones or black and white shots are dripping in style and hue. The supporting cast is breathtakingly talented. Kudos to the casting agents and/or executives who fanagled the likes of Jim Broadbent as the sweaty, greedy, worldly bossman; and whomever it was that foresaw Richard Roxburgh as the ferociously needy Duke of Worcester should be summarily knighted.Luhrmann's vision in creating Moulin Rouge is almost incomprehendible. Four parts music video, three parts Picasso and five parts chocolate mousse, this film should take a number of Oscars next year; the Academy may as well hand over the best musical score statue now, and be surprised -- be very surprised -- if Luhrmann isn't nominated to walk away with the best director prize.",10,0,1,6 June 2001
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Kaufman's brilliant. 'Nuff said.
","Being John Malkovich was visionary; disturbing; hilarious; charming. Adaptation was weird; satisfying; challenging.Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind equals those previous outings with a fascinating journey through a man's memories. Jim Carrey will be described as 'understated' a million times before this film finishes its run in theatres, and deservedly so. The rubber-limbed heir apparent to Jerry Lewis turns in a finely muted performance here.Kate Winslet, instead, is the wacky off-the-shelf number -- she made *me* fall in and out of love with her during the course of this film. I've enjoyed her in past films but I was absolutely spellbound by her Clementine in Spotless.Elijah Wood, Kirsten Dunst, Thomas Jay Ryan and Tom Wilkinson work for the company that erases things or people from memories -- they're solid but unspectacular as supporting cast. This film is all about Kaufman's wonderful script and Carrey & Winslet's riveting performances.I'm a cynic -- I don't come out of the theatre raving very often. This is one of those times.",9,0,1,19 March 2004
The Godfather: Part III," Overwritten, overacted, and largely overcriticized
","Despite all its shortcomings, this was still better than 99% of the movies that came out in the 90s. It deserved its Best Picture nomination, but the series was rightly denied its third Best Picture Oscar. Sophia Coppola has since proved herself as a darned fine writer and director -- a good thing, since she's an abysmally bad actor. The young Anthony Garcia doesn't have half the chops, or a quarter of the charisma, as the young Pacino or the young DeNiro did, and THAT's why we're not likely to see a Godfather, Part IV anytime soon. Trading Robert Duvall for George Hamilton as the family consigliare ain't no small downsizing, either. Still, worthwhile just to see Pacino gnaw on the gorgeous sets in that gorgeous sweater vest.",8,0,1,5 March 2004
The Terminal," ... I felt like I'd been in the THEATRE for nine months
","Widely publicized and reviewed, it hardly seems necessary to recount the premise for this one. For tradition's sake, here goes: The Terminal is about Viktor Navorsky, a man forced by bureaucracy to live in an airport terminal for months -- his country, the fictional Krakozhia, has been the victim of a bloody coup during his flight, leaving him with no homeland and no international recognition. He begins with no English whatsoever, and finishes with a high-paying job, friends, romance and an impressive command of the English language.Parts of this film work, and work well. Tom Hanks is one of the most likable guys in Hollywood, both on- and off-screen. Spielberg, no matter how much you lament his success, is a proven storyteller. He pushes buttons like no other filmmaker on the planet. Whether you appreciate her acting chops or not, Catherine Zeta-Jones has a kind of on-screen shine like few of her peers. And the talented Stanley Tucci, at times, is able to inject some feeling into the one-dimensional bureaucrat responsible for Navorski's stay in travel limbo. All of those things help to make bits of The Terminal palatable -- unfortunately, Spielberg neglected to use the editing parts of his skills with this picture. All the scenes that don't quite work, the ones that usually end up in the 'deleted scenes' portion of the DVD, that drag the story or give unnecessary distraction for a bit of character development... They're all here in the theatrical release which clocks in at a way-too-long 128 minutes.The screenplay uses every hackneyed script tool that focus groups approve of: snippets of dialogue, charming at first, repeated at key points in the movie to be pithy, insightful or condescending; unlikely combinations of ethnic characters in supporting roles; the unwavering, nasty antagonist who wavers in the end; the heartfelt quest eventually fulfilled; and the gorgeous love interest where real life would serve up, if any, a wholly average human specimen. These elements are introduced in such a formulaic fashion that not a one surprises. Each step of the way is overly choreographed, and unfortunately, well-telegraphed. If I could see the future like this at the casino, I'd be a rich man.Only in the United States could someone become trapped by regulations for such a long time without someone saying, 'wait a minute -- the rules weren't meant to do THIS.' (The fact that many people believe this movie is based on a true story is testament to the sometimes amazing incredulousness of US Customs & Immigration.)Only in the United States could so many powerful, talented people get together and make this much of a bore out of this much potential.",5,0,4,10 July 2004
