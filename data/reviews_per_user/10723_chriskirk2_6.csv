Kill Bill: Vol. 2," The YANG to 'Vol.1''s YING
","Tarantino has done it again. He's the man,baby. The action scenes are quicker; but equally impactive. The brilliant Tarantino dialogue dominates this one,however. This film,like the amazing Vol 1,is Tarantino playfully presenting everything he loves: cinema and pop culture, great music and great acting, badass characters sayin' badass words,etc. And unlike the action orgy that is volume 1, this one gives the characters a couple of minutes to breathe, B.S with each other, and philosophize. Volume 2 has a different vibe; this one is a compliment the first film's wild non-stop frenzy. Tarantino displays the surest of hands; making the audience laugh, scream, jump, even feel for these gleefully nasty characters. His answers-before-questions structure is still there,and it works very well. He's turned a simple revenge plot into an astonishing saga. Tarantino is 5 for 5(excluding the tragic FOUR ROOMS). God, he's good.",Null,0,1,20 April 2004
Dawn of the Dead," Boy, does this rule!!!
","I've seen the original Dawn a billion times. I specifically remember renting it from MAJOR VIDEO in 1983. I was 8 years old. The shocking gore gave me nightmares. When I was 13, I bought my own VHS copy. AT 21 I got the laserdisc for Christmas-still have it. I eventually bought the many DVD incarnations...etc. My point is this: I KNOW((and really love)the zombie genre, and I was weary of this remake. Why remake perfection? Because the lame action movie '28 days later'(whatever 14-year old girl was quoted as saying it was the scariest horror film since the EXORCIST was retarded) made money? I feared this remake would suck. Well, it does not suck. It is,in fact, one of the top zombie flix, ever. DOTD 04' is a frightening, post 9/11 re-think of the classic original. The zombies are scary, not to mention fast. The first 20 minutes pull you in, and the sharp direction, acting, script, and editing keep you on edge. This is potent fun, with moments of sharp humor; as well as a strong sense of apocalyptic paranoia. This well-worthy rethink of the original is a blast. George Romero should be proud.",10,10,17,20 April 2004
Hostel," thank you, god!!!
","Eli Roth for president. Two Americans and a dude from Iceland drink, smoke and screw their way across Europe. They end up at a too-good-to-be-true hostel. They party one more time with two staggeringly beautiful Russian broads(Barbera Nedeljakova is breath-taking), the Iceland guy disappears, and our American cats find themselves in deep trouble. Mr. Roth has re-ignited the horror genre. He's a horror-fanatic's horror fanatic. Horror is dangerous and ugly again. PG-13? Nope. Try a very hard R Rating-including lovely boobs, smashed skulls, exploding girl whose guts fly onto screaming spectators, eyeball-blow-torching,bolt-cutter -toe removal, fantasy corpse-surgery, and orgasmic-hypocritical-revenge that the viewer can rejoice in! This film works the viewer into a blood-thirsty revenge-fanatic. This is feverishly crazy, not to mention funny, stuff. In a film so soaked in grimy torture, death becomes a relief-a bit of a laugh(thanks to clever editing). When the tortured character exacts his sicko revenge, I was giddy. Kudos for casting unknowns. Kudos for hiring the editor that worked with John Landis when he did good films. Kudos to KNB effects for keeping the shot-in-camera effects alive. The gore is revoltingly beautiful. This film is disgusting. I love it!!!!",10,1,4,19 April 2006
This Is Spinal Tap," big ups, meat head!!!
","Too bad the rating system doesn't go to 11. Totally brilliant. The accurately retarded stage shows, the dying drummers, the too-small bread,the amazing(mostly improvised) interviews, the malfunctioning concert props , the fact that you can't really dust for vomit, listening to the guitar that would sound amazing if it were being played, the one-louder amp, the Tap's 'appeal becoming more selective'; this film brilliantly lampoons many pompous metal-morons. Can you say double feature with 'Some kind of monster'?? Every scene is special. This is a comedy masterpiece. Both DVDs are essential. Meathead is the best director this side of Opie Taylor.",10,0,3,13 May 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," the Sith hits the fan
","The dialog is VIVID VIDEO. Jenna Jameson has the right to laugh at a lot of the dramatic performances. So it sucks,then? Is it really that bad? Nope. It delivers, overall. Lucas has taken ques from many of his hard-core critics; toughening the prequels up with pain, violence(PG-13. Hello!?!)and and the strongest downer-vibe since 'Empire'. Most of the action is beautiful. Lucas figured out what the geeks want: Lightsabers , Lightsabers, and Lightsabers. Episode 4 was based on a samurai flick, and that base helped make it mythological. In the name of bridging 3 and 4, Lucas has thousands of those suckers buzzing round-and-round. It works pretty nicely, giving the prequels a physical danger that was noticeably absent from 1 and 2. This one is still like 90% cgi-cartoon, but I'm kind of used to the loony-tune epic landscapes. The sense of 'this is it,folks' provides the most stirring moments. Live it up, people. We all know how this hub bub is going to end up;Bravo to Lucas for trying his best to make the build-up to a 30-year-old-holy-film interesting for the sneering adults as well as the wide-eyed kids. This one is too-close to great to be dismissed. This is it.",7,1,2,22 August 2005
Goodfellas," Easily the best film of the 90's
","Third on the 'best gangster film' list; right behind the first two GODFATHERS- This grand story follows the lives of a group of tough hoods through four fascinating decades. Scorsese is the world's current greatest living filmmaker; and he really hit an amazing peak here. The direction, cast, editing, script and period detail are all flawless. Unlike the GODFATHER, these hoods are petty, wild and occasionally insane. These are working guys, living it up and 'earning' at all costs. Scorsese changes gears according to the times: The laid-back, high living' 50's and 60's; the crazy, coked-out 70's; as well as the crash-and-burn 80's; Scorsese show the flash, the power, and the degradation of these amazing guys. This is an great American work of art from front to back.",10,0,1,1 September 2005
