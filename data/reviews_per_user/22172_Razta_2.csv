Lucky Number Slevin," You think you figured it out from start ??
","Yes, ladies and gents, its here, this could be one of the best thriller/action movie of this year . Yeah, at first glance of the actors list, you might think, hey Bruce Willis is playing in this, so it must be another boom/bang action movie, but you are wrong, you might think this if you only saw him in 2 movies, that is the Die Hard, Die Hard 2. Well it is not a rambo style action movie, nor kill bill style. It is the kind of movie that makes you spin in the chair when you are watching it. It never gets boring, it always keeps you entertained, thats what matters. There are a few clich√©s in this story, but besides that it is great.You think you know whats going to happen at the end, from the start of the movie ?? Well , expect the unexpected. :D It is truly a movie worth watching, which I think, in these days is a rarity.",10,2,10,25 May 2006
Silent Hill," It is what true horror fans have been waiting for
","It is based on a video game series, yes, its true, but that doesn't make it a bad movie, it is I think the best movie adaptation after a video game.Yeah, some might say but after a while they found it boring, or simply too confusing...hellooo !!!, people , this is not just a simple horror movie, where a guy, or thing is the evil, and starts chopping up other 'inocent' characters...not, even closse, this is that kind of horror movie that makes you put your brain at work, whilst watching it, so you wanna figure things out, and you wait anxiously to reach the end, so you might get things cleared up..and these kinda things keep you all along the movie entertained, and these things make it such a great movie, which i think deserves to be watched. So get your as*es to the movies, or the DVD rentals :D !",9,0,2,20 May 2006
