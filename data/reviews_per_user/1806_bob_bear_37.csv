The Devil's Advocate," Superior Supernatural Thriller
","This film kept me interested from the get go - and there aren't many movies that I can honestly say that about. I can usually spot a plot hole at a hundred miles but this film just saw me suspend my disbelief and enter into the the (evil) spirit of the thing.The cast are uniformly excellent. Yes, even Keanu! He turns in the best acting performance I've ever seen him do. Pacino's performance is wonderfully measured - from subtle to all out ham. And the dialog is excellent.I was slightly disappointed with the climax - but only slightly - and as others have pointed out the film just keeps you guessing throughout - despite all the advertising telling you the real biggie before it even starts - it still proves to be gripping and well-worth watching. Recommended.",8,1,2,3 February 2006
Skyfall," Style over Substance
","Film critcs raved that this was a return to form -- a classic Bond film. That wasn't my take on it. Casino Royale beat it by miles IMHO. I found it a disappointment.The visuals were terrific for the most part but the plot was clichéd and full of holes. I understand that Bond films are by nature fantastical but the longer this film went on the less fantastical and the more dull/ridiculous it became.Daniel Craig's face looks like an immovable bag of spanners throughout whilst Javier Badem's bad blond dye-job simply does not work -- especially when dressed as a policeman. Who thought that was a good idea??? Where were the Bond babes? Eve didn't cut mustard and the other woman was like blink and you'll miss her. The only scene that sizzled ended up being the homo-erotic interrogation but they didn't have the balls to pursue that strand so instead we got more bunkum like ueber English Judi Dench quoting Tennyson and Albert Finney's Hoots, Mon, there's a moose loose about this hoose Scottish Caretaker.It just didn't work for me.",4,13,26,7 June 2013
Gravity," I don't understand the raves...
","Like so many before me, I was looking forward to watching and enjoying one of the films, if not THE film of the year. The critics raved about it. IMDb rates it an 8.4 average.What a disappointment.The first five minutes introduced us to three characters, two male buffoons acting like five year olds in a space playground and a female engineer, temperamentally unsuited to being on the mission. She cannot follow orders and ultimately causes both their deaths -- not that she seems to give that much thought -- and we are supposed to care about her and her plight? There is no one here to care about.The visuals aren't enough. Watching Bullock pinball from one crisis to another gets old really quickly.Honestly, I don't understand the raves. Poor to average at best.",4,4,10,28 December 2013
Underworld," Another One Bite's The Dust
","Imagine the pitch: Writer in front of Hollywood Producer: This is the idea: Emma Peel meets Blade via The Matrix.Hollywood Producer: Wow! That's really derivative! You got yourself a deal!! Yes, folks, Underworld really can be summed up in that one line concept. But, unfortunately, IMDb require more lines in a posting. So a couple of other points while I'm about it.Ms Beckensale does an amazing job of sustaining one facial expression throughout. What an actress! Clichés abound. As do plot holes. Note:Woman scorned eavesdropping. Guard told not to let Selene out of her room at any cost. Woman scorned turns off lights. Guard miraculously disappears. Selene escapes. Cobblers! A triumph of form over content. The producer must be laughing all the way to the bank.",5,0,2,25 November 2006
The Day After Tomorrow," It is what it is...
","Maybe I was in the mood to suspend my disbelief but I actually enjoyed this spectacle. And a spectacle is what it is.I don't really understand the indignant reviewers who claim it is full of scientific inaccuracies and plot holes. It's an entertainment. It takes liberties. It comes with the territory.I agree, the human interest aspect could've been less hokey but no way is the script as corny and schmaltz-laden as the truly terrible Independence Day.I expected the worst and was pleasantly surprised. An enjoyable enough Saturday evening's entertainment.",8,1,3,4 April 2009
Milk," Preferred the Docu
",Aside from Sean Penn's bravura performance this could have been a TV movie...a HBO movie at least.Harvey was a true hero but this movie just didn't crank it up for me. Bad wigs/beards abound and it's just a bit dull.What was the opening subway scene about? Did Harvey know Scotty or was he just tricking him in the the stairwell?Coors gets the boot stuck in but no mention of the ban on Anita's Florida Orange juice campaign?I wanted to see this movie for an age but really The Times of Harvey Milk documentary is more informative and more authentic. I expected better.,6,0,4,14 March 2011
Final Destination 2," Surprisingly Good
","I came to this film with no expectations - I hadn't seen the original installment. The way the opening builds to a creshendo of horror is spectacular. From then on, - and, once I'd gotten over the shock of the gruesome death of the first 'survivor', I found myself both thoroughly entertained and impressed. Intelligent horror? Yes, it is possible!Unlike, other reviewers, I thought the acting was excellent by and large. The only truly irritating moments in the movie were provided by the black character who repeatedly refused to believe something spooky was going on in the face of increasingly overwhelming evidence - it's a stock device and it's so lame. But this had nothing to do with the guy's acting ability, which I thought was excellent given the limitations of his given character.Otherwise, I was just totally impressed by the artistry of the team behind this shocker. The build-up of tension, the tease, that led towards each death was masterful.I read the list of 'goofs' the film is supposed to feature and, with only one exception, I didn't spot any. I was just so drawn in to the action.I'm not big on horror as a genre but, if you're going to watch an odd horror or two, I can certainly recommend this.",8,0,1,19 February 2006
Ant-Man," Deserves to be crushed under a shoe
","Okay, enough already! Another formulaic load of old tripe featuring boring, cocksure, dumb and supposedly somehow charming hero blessed with super powers he doesn't deserve and boring us all to death through two turgid hours of special effects and a plot you could write on the back of a postage stamp. (Iron Man, Green Lantern, et al. anybody?) This one thinks it's a bit of a comedy...except the lame jokes are sign posted about a mile away and deserve to be punctuated with a ba-dumb-tish on the snare drum.Ant Man. A lousy idea and a lousy film. 2 hours of my life I will never get back. And the threat at the end?: 'Ant Man will return!' Don't bother!!",1,48,102,9 January 2016
21 Jump Street," Good Grief! A US comedy that is actually FUNNY??!!
","What was I expecting? Not much! Expectations lowered by Adam Sandler's laughter-free efforts and Seth Rogan's adolescent tripe. But no. Here is a US comedy that actually works beyond the confines of low-brow, mass market, bunkum.Inspired bits of business. Laugh out loud moments. And a core story of friendship that is both amusing and touching.The storyline is ridiculous, lets face it. The leads wouldn't pass for high school age in a blind school. But who cares? It works. It's funny. It entertained. And it made me laugh. What more could you want from a comedy?",7,2,3,14 August 2012
Oblivion," I have seen the future...and it's been done before and better.
","10 minutes in and I was thinking: 'This is boring.' And one hour fifty minutes later as the credits rolled I was left feeling no different.It's obvious that piles of money were thrown at this project but to what end? The characters don't engage the emotions. The plot is utterly derivative and full of holes. The direction plods. It's a complete snooze.Tom Cruise looks old. The female actors provide little more than decoration. Morgan Freeman is employed (yet again) to add gravitas to a load of old bunkum (as he was in Olympus Has Fallen) and fails (again).The trailer had me hoping for a spectacular, firecracker of a film experience but all I got was a damp squib. Boring and disappointing. A waste of two (L-O-N-G) hours.Slow. Overly-long. Dull. Not recommended.",3,0,3,26 December 2013
Pitch Black," The Posiedan Adventure In Space
","This film is a variation of a theme we've all seen over and over again - the Posiedan adventure in Space. The characters are all stock characters - feisty heroine, Judas, coward, etc. etc. The only question really is who's next to snuff it. Sometimes this tried and tested formula works - like in this case - but more often not - like the truly mind-numbing 'Red Planet.' So why does this one work? Because it's stylish. The acting is above average. And above all it isn't predictable. The conclusion isn't sign-posted. I really had no idea how it would all end and was surprised at how it did end. That alone deserves top marks in my book.It's an intriguing and entertaining movie. And though it was never likely to change the face of cinema as we know it, it doesn't disappoint.",8,3,5,26 September 2005
Little Miss Sunshine," Over-hyped Tripe
","Boring is what this movie is. Oh, and cheap. Boring and cheap. Dysfunctional family takes road trip to Beauty Pagent where child puts in a totally naff 'performance' and you end up wondering how she ever qualified to take part in the first place - that is, if you are not already wondering how the film got made at all! The hype surrounding this film set me up for a fall. Great expectations leading to great disappointment. The fabulous Toni Collette is utterly wasted. Alan Arkin's Oscar nomination off the back of it proves that the sympathy vote is alive and well.It's just not very good.",3,2,5,28 November 2007
Van Helsing," Van Noying
","Pantomime tripe. There, I said it! All those reviewers who say something along the lines of: 'Lighten up, it's only a camp romp?' Well, I didn't know that when I sat down to watch it! Why would I? It is sold as a Vampire Horror flick. It wasn't called Carry On Van Helsing was it? So what do we get? A totally unscary Vampire movie that looks like it had piles of money thrown at it when what it needed was sense and a decent script. Richard Roxburgh's 'pantomime' Dracula is dreadful. The CGI stuff is totally unconvincing. 'Mr Hyde', for example, changes in size in relation to Van Helsing every time they share a shot. In fact the whole movie is like a badly drawn cartoon.",4,12,21,24 December 2006
Independence Day," Brainless Tosh!
","Brainless is one word to describe this movie. Tosh is another. Put 'em both together and you've just about covered it.Seldom can so much money have been thrown at such a stinker. Why was the script so bad, the dialog so dreadful, the characters so cringe-worthy? Why??? Action movies don't have to be brainless - it's not a prerequisite component. So why was the script so dire?As a poor excuse for said script what we get is a load of jingoistic, hyper-macho chest-beating rhetoric played out by a bunch of toy soldiers. Women consigned to damsel in distress roles - or undressed roles, if we take Will Smith's Stripper Bride(!)into account. And the only gay character - a complete cartoon nelly who flaps about to illustrate panic - ends up trapped in his car awaiting certain death after issuing his last 'comic' line. Oh, puh-leeze!This film stinks. It stinks! The End.",1,4,6,15 September 2007
No Country for Old Men," More of the same from the Coen's
","If you've seen Fargo, you'll know what to expect. Quirky dialog and quirky characters. A lot of silence. Panoramic views. Gory injuries. Menace and unease.Badem's one-note performance did not deserve an Oscar IMHO. It was sufficient, nothing more. Carla-Jean's mother was like a cartoon character off the Muppets complete with bad wig. Not sure what that was about.Was nice to have a change from formula Hollywood movies. Then again, the Coen brothers obviously have their formula and are sticking with it.Not deserving of all the plaudits but better than the average Hollywood fayre.",7,0,6,22 January 2012
Mamma Mia!," Diar Rhrea!
","The occasional moment of brilliance - like Meryl Streep's interpretation of The Winner Takes It All - only serves to hammer home the fact that Benny & Bjorn deserved a much better context into which to place their songs.The plot - such as it is - is preposterous. As if three grown men would drop everything and race off to a Greek Island at the behest of a woman with whom they had a fleeting Summer romance 20 years earlier (with no subsequent contact) and all in order to attend the Wedding of someone they don't even know. It's a rotten, empty premise for a film that goes nowhere quick - but not quick enough! The casting is appalling. No chemistry between Donna and her mates. The two lackluster juvenile leads would be better cast in a daytime soap. Nobody can sing - and it's a musical!!! Really, words fail me. I haven't seen such a stinker since Love Actually. That it is the highest grossing British movie of all time is enough to make this punter despair.",3,4,6,27 January 2009
Wreck-It Ralph," 7.8 -- as voted for by Disney?
",In recent years there have been a number of animated movies that manage to appeal to both children and to adult audiences. This isn't one of them.The morality is questionable. The humor is crude. The plot could have been written on the back of a postage stamp.The animation is of an excellent standard but it really doesn't matter when it's being used to illustrate characters you don't warm to and a storyline that is as dull as dishwater.This film had me watching the clock and willing it to end. Had I not been watching it with friends then I would certainly have switched off.There is no way that this deserves the raves or the 7.8 average. It is a million miles away from Finding Nemo.,2,10,28,24 June 2013
Velvet Goldmine," Velvet Slagpile
","I'm a glam rock aficionado, okay? I admit it and I am not ashamed. I grew up listening to the whole glam gamut - from The Sweet thru Bowie via Jobriath and all the rest. This film promised so much more than it delivered. It looks cheap. The Wilde references are pretentious nonsense. And Brian Slade/Maxwell Demon? Maybe he could have faked his death whilst trying to act his way out of a paper bag and expired with the effort? He'd have had me convinced! Toni Collette is marvelous as always - and totally wasted on this pile. The original music is also surprisingly good. But the script is more Velvet Slagpile than Goldmine. Ewan 'Any excuse to get my privates out' McGregor's acting talent and singing ability were noticeable by their absence.This should have been so much better.",3,2,7,23 July 2005
X-Men: The Last Stand," Z-Men...The last bore? I do hope so!
","The post credits additional scenes are tripe and only serve to make a mockery of the whole project.Vinnie Jones is awful. But then he has plenty of company. Halle Berry's god-awful, corn on the cob performance/dialog deserving special recognition.I didn't so much hate this film as to be bored and frustrated by it. Other comic book transitions were fun, engaging e.g. Spiderman, Fantastic Four, Constantine...these appear to have had an intelligence behind them. This film has none of it...it is just a pile of brainless, corny poo.No explanation as to how the bald child held the 'cure'. No sympathy for the lovelorn Wolverine. No belief in Jean's wig that might have done for a glamorous transvestite but not a major motion picture. And as for the 'Thunderbirds' airplane taking them forever to get anywhere??? What a load of crapola! Oh and the sight of Ian McKellen in that helmet??? Somebody should have told him what an idiot he looked. Talk about the oldest X-swinger in town!!!! An utter disappointment. 3 out of 10",3,1,2,6 February 2011
P.S. I Love You," P.P.S. It's god-awful...
","If they were out to make a bittersweet rom-com in the style of Richard Curtis then the producers succeeded. This film is just as vapid, insincere, superficial, unfunny and as lacking in genuine sentiment as anything Curtis ever produced.Holly, the shrew, falls for cartoon Irish romeo, Gerry, and persuades him (one imagines)to move to America where they marry. They live in a dump and he works as a limo driver while she can't hold down a job because of her ever present attitude problem. Oh, and then he dies of a brain tumor.Cue the ever present soundtrack of mawkish folk-rock ditties that intrude at every opportunity. On the rare occasions they stop intruding we get the cheesy Celtic pipes tweeting away in their place. Whoever put this soundtrack together needs to be shot.Despite the fact that Holly has no discernible income, she takes herself over to a Disney version of Ireland and by random chance ends up in bed with Gerry's childhood best friend who she apparently had never heard of. In the afterglow of their rumpy-pumpy he charms her with boyhood tales of his friendship with her dead husband --as one would.Skipping over the rest of this garbage, the film's resolution again sees the penniless Holly take her mother to Ireland to 'hear her laugh once more'. Pass the sick bucket.Just for once, it would have been nice to see a film that moved me because it was sincere.Okay, if you loved Mama Mia and Love Actually you'll probably love this. If you didn't, you have been warned!!",2,12,19,30 January 2011
Unknown," Not Unknown
","In 1991 a thriller called Shattered was released. Starring Tom Berenger, the plot revolved around a central figure who was suffering from amnesia as a result of an accident --and therein hung the mystery. Except I solved it in about the first 10 minutes but kept thinking: 'Nah! It can't be that obvious?!' Ahem, well, yes it was.Now they do say there are only a limited number of stories to be told so I shouldn't be surprised to find myself watching a variation of the above. And the twist in the tale was equally predictable though not quite as dumb.It's stylish and well-acted overall. Loved the Berlin setting. Recognised loads of familiar locations. For the most part, the movie kept my interest.Points I didn't like. Cartoon violence. e.g. Guy gets smashed over the head with crowbar but continues fighting. Bad guy's henchman beats up on Liam Neeson's character at any given opportunity for no good reason --especially given what he is actually capable of. And the other unbelievable stuff like the Professor taking his laptop and two kiddies to a high profile, cocktail party. Again, ahem.It's an okay entertainment but doesn't deserve the raves.",Null,2,2,19 July 2011
From Dusk Till Dawn," Nice Cinematography, Shame About The Script
","The film looks good. That cannot be denied. It looks stylish and is directed with flair. Unfortunately, the script plays out like it's the product of an immature adolescent personality who needs to get out more and mix with other kids his own age. The dialogue is just cringeworthy.One cannot help but think that someone indulged Tarantino based on previous successes in funding this project - indulged him to the point of allowing him to act in it - and made a big boob on all counts.I scare easy but this vampire horror movie with all its (much trumpeted) blood and guts didn't produce a single goosebump. It was like watching a cartoon.Disappointing.",4,2,5,12 February 2006
Hedwig and the Angry Inch," Magnificent
",So many glowing reviews...and here's another one! I love this movie. Bought the DVD and Soundtrack. Watch it regularly. Especially the songs. Takes me to another world.The cast is uniformly excellent - even those with non-speaking roles. Stansislavski said that great acting is about 'reacting' and the cast reacts brilliantly to a central performance that is nothing short of amazing. Special credit to the drummer who wasn't a drummer but an actor - totally convincing and gorgeous to boot. (Where's his starring vehicle??!)Can't recommend this film highly enough.,10,1,2,24 March 2007
Sinister," Horrible for all the wrong reasons
","I watched this because it rated 6.7. The reviews were glowing. I can only conclude said reviews were faked or written by people who are too easily pleased.The opening was promising. Intriguing. Stylish. But the style -- with its dimly lit interiors -- becomes simply annoying real fast and the plot degenerates into utter nonsense.What kind of nutcase moves his wife and two young kids into a home where the gruesome multiple murder of a family occurred? It wasn't necessary. Then when presented with a set of horrific home movies, what kind of person would take days to work their way through them? You'd stay up all night if you had to in search of answers. What kind of dullard doesn't react to the fact that the projector switches on in the middle of the night in a locked room on at least two occasions? Doesn't seem to bother our hero much if at all. And, given the above, why should we have any sympathy with him??? No reason at all. There's a truly awful reveal scene towards the end where Mum & Dad go on to argue over the wisdom of staying in the house. The dialog feels like it was improvised and the scene shot in one take. Improvised badly that is. It totally exposes what a load of bunkum we are being expected to swallow.It's not often that I end watching a film feeling angry but this one managed it. Like THAT is what this was all about? That rubbish? I felt utterly conned.",3,2,5,2 April 2013
3 Idiots," 3 hours too long
","I rented this movie largely because of my love for Aamir and the rave reviews on here but in the event it was a disappointment.The film is crude and vulgar in parts. This is something I did not expect from Bollywood. I don't appreciate fart gags in UK/US movies and I certainly didn't like them here.Having 40-odd year old guys playing 18 year old students was somehow more ridiculous than normal --even for a Bollywood movie where, lets face it, reality is the least consideration.But what this film really confirmed to me was that Aamir is always surrounded by second rate actors. The frumpy girlfriend with glasses was as dreary as his two student buddies. There is no one to compete with him here. Other than Dil Chahta Hai, I've never seen him act in an ensemble. For the most part it is the Aamir show all the way. Yes, he's a fabulous actor but having him take center stage with zero competition does him no favors and makes for a boring 3 hours.Nope, sorry. I found the film a bore and I expected better.",Null,3,7,12 August 2011
Jack Reacher," If you haven't read the book -- Enjoy!
","I didn't realize I'd already read the book until the film started. I read a lot of crime novels and whilst One Shot had been one of the more memorable ones, Jack Reacher as a character, had obviously not stood out for me and I hadn't retained a picture of him in my mind -- certainly not one that was as inflexible as those on here who have rushed to trash the casting. So TC as JR did not bother me at all.Time limits meant that the book needed to be condensed. I think they did it well but inevitably some of the detail gets lost and with it a certain amount of suspense. Still it was well made and above average for the genre IMHO.The main point in reading crime fiction is to solve the mystery and I already knew the solution so it was a pretty pointless exercise watching the film of the book. However, If you are one of the gazillions of people who haven't read the book and aren't bringing their preconceptions to the table I'd say watch it and enjoy. It's better than most of the rubbish Hollywood churns out these days.",7,5,9,14 June 2013
Thor," One Mighty Bhor
","I genuinely cannot believe the positive reviews on here that sing the praises of this hackneyed, tedious and pretentious load of old codswallop.It bored me. I mean as in BORED STIFF. The lead actor has all the charisma of a peanut. The script was dreadful. The FX were utterly underwhelming.Unfortunately, I watched it immediately after that other recent pile of crud aka The Green Lantern. It's like they used the same template. Unsympathetic, arrogant hero, stupid romance, evil twin, corrupt government interference on and on.Sometimes Comic Book heroes make a fun transfer -- Spiderman, Fantastic Four -- more often they seem to turn out like this tripe. I expected better from Brannagh. Big mistake! My recommendation: Don't waste valuable hours of your life on this pile!",Null,0,3,13 November 2011
Love Actually," Tripe, actually
","A stellar cast is drawn together for...what? For the biggest load of tripe I've had the misfortune to sit through in a long time.Hmmm...Romantic COMEDY? Laugh...I thought I'd never start - and I was not wrong. Not a chuckle, not a titter was raised. Humour of the middle-class dinner party variety doesn't work for me. Lame, obvious jokes and cartoon characters abound. 'Common as muck' Natalie swears in front of the 'upper-crust' Prime Minister and we're supposed to find it funny? Charming? Believable??? PREPOSTEROUS?! LOVE? If Richard Curtis thinks his threadbare characterizations and superficial plot lines constitute or represent love in any meaningful way then he is bonkers, actually.Utter rubbish. Disney for grown-ups.",1,98,169,29 June 2006
The Terminal," Terminal Boredom
","Based on a true story? In that case, it is clearly not where you start it is what you finish up with. And what you finish up with is so far beyond the bounds of belief it will leave you gasping.A film that is utterly preposterous from the get-go. Why wait for an interpreter when you can just talk at someone who clearly cannot understand more than ten words of English and then dump him in a Terminal and leave him to his own devices? Oh, yes and don't bother to inform the authorities from his own Embassy that would just be too sensible!Well, what do you know...our hero finds a deserted area within the terminal where he can make his bed, leave his suitcase unattended and make himself at home...Skipping over the rest of this crappola...like the woman accepting a marriage proposal from someone she doesn't know because Viktor intercedes...like him renovating all night just for the fun of it, like you would...like the head of security disobeying his boss and experiencing no repercussions...we end up with love interest, Amelia, selling her virtue in order to enable him to get an autograph...which Viktor, prince that he is, willingly accepts.This film is an utter insult to the intelligence. Absolute rubbish of the first order!",Null,0,1,8 August 2011
The Conjuring," 70's Blair Witch Bunkum

Utter bunkum of the 1st degree.Family buy haunted house and refuse to leave despite everyone's subsequent traumatic experiences? Yes, my arse!The lead actress looks old enough to be her husband's mother.Hackneyed old haunted house rubbish with Roman Catholic exorcist tripe thrown in.Complete bunkum.

Prometheus," A feast for the eyes and starvation for the brain.
","How this film is averaging 7.7 gawd only knows -- when most of the reviews I've read give it 1 or 2? I'm not an Aliens superfan so I did not bring that baggage to my viewing. I watched it as a stand alone. More fool me.It is, in a nutshell, a feast for the eyes and starvation for the brain.The plot is so ill-thought through, so dumb, so full of plot holes it begger's belief. The opening is spectacular but ultimately makes no sense. But before we figure that out we are introduced to the crew of Prometheus who are awoken from stasis. The engineer with the tats? Who would employ him? WHO?!?! Or the rest of them come to that? It's a trillion dollar mission and this bunch of losers are the best they can get??? And from the get-go you know the film is going to be a pile but you sit through it, hoping in vain...Countless reviewers have listed it's faults and foibles. I can only agree. It's a senseless mess. An insult to the intelligence and Ridley Scott should be ashamed. If so many people can see its countless faults then how come he couldn't? The Grey was bad but this is an utter waste of millions. Shameful.",1,4,8,14 October 2012
The Woman in Black," Back to Black
","Fabulous, throughly entertaining, beautifully photographed, well-acted, well-scripted and scary. What more could one want from a Gothic ghost story? I cannot believe this film is currently scored a measly 6.6 on here -- or the derogatory rants/reviews that say it is clichéd and dull. I absolutely loved it! What were they expecting? Paranormal Activity 101??? It exceeds Hammer films usual production values on every level -- from the casting through to the scares, it is top notch.Daniel Radcliffe is a joy to watch and certainly has both the subtlety and the gravitas to carry the lead role.This was a film that exceeded it's trailer for once! I'd been looking forward to seeing it and was not disappointed. Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys an intelligent, well-crafted ghost story.",8,0,1,16 June 2012
Signs," When strange is just plain odd...
","Loved Sixth Sense like everyone else. Didn't enjoy Unbreakable at all. Hence, when Signs came along, despite it being the only film I recall the director getting positive reviews for other than 'Sense', I waited for a TV showing and am glad I saved my money...It's an odd film. Really odd. It's not bad, it's not good it's just...odd. The children act like they have Asperger's syndrome they are so brittle and disconnected and odd... The father is odd and his younger brother is odd...Why do people refer to Mel as 'Father' and want to 'confess' to him when his character isn't Catholic? Why did the director cast himself and thereby shatter our collective suspension of disbelief? Why does the director's character head off to the lake because he's heard the aliens don't go there?...heard it from whom exactly??? How did he trap an alien in his kitchen cupboard before he went? I will let others rant about the glaring plot holes --they didn't occur to me at the time I was watching the movie. It's just not a satisfactory entertainment. Ill-thought through to the point of being delusional. And odd. Above all else, it's odd.",5,1,3,7 June 2009
Pineapple Express," 7 laughs in the entire thing...so bored I counted
",Seldom have I watched a film that is so self-consciously (and desperately) trying to be funny and fail so dismally.It is to comedy what Tarantino is to pulp drama --the adolescent imaginings of someone who really ought to get out more and mix with kids their own age. In a word -- Juvenile.I laughed 7 times through the whole thing -- with the first laugh coming about mid-way. Had I not been watching it with a friend (who genuinely didn't think it was supposed to be a comedy) I would never have got that far.Rosie Perez must've been desperate for a job to take this one.As for the last scene being improvised? No surprise there. I'm only surprised they didn't just give themselves a round of applause at the end they were all so obviously delighted with themselves.If you liked The Hangover and Due Date then you'll probably love this. Enough said.,3,5,11,3 April 2011
Gladiator," Epic Tripe Gets The Thumbs Down!
",To my mind this film is totally overrated. Why did Russel Crowe win best actor Oscar? He can drool but he can't cry!! And as for the Oscar winning sub-Enya and intrusive soundtrack??? The dialogue is laughable. Derek (Theatre Luvvy) Jacobi's vain attempt to imbue cornball dialogue with the gravity of Shakespeare is laughable. There must be every accent in the book on display here. Who's ever heard of an Australian Gladiator?!  Authentic??? I think not!I expected better from a movie that won best Oscar. Moulin Rouge was robbed. Baz was robbed. Thumbs down!,Null,0,1,25 July 2003

","Saw this movie advertised on TV. I'd never heard of it - did it even get a cinema release in the UK? I suspect not and, if that is the case, it's clear why.Firstly, who was the target audience? 80's rock fans? I can't think of anybody else who would watch it. And there aren't enough of them to make an impact at the box office, Secondly, it's not a good film. Aniston is wasted on a thankless part and Wahlberg tries his best but ultimately fails. The script is to blame. It's formulaic to the point of parody.Many of the reviews have suggested that it is an accurate portrayal of the rock and roll life style. How do they know? Because they read Kerrang??? It told me nothing new. No insights.It's not a bad film - I've seen worse. But it's not good either. As for the 'hold on to your dream' clap-trap message? Give me a break! Burt nailed it: 'And all the stars that never were are parking cars and pumping gas...'",Null,1,2,18 November 2004

","Loads of money thrown at a pitiful script. Don't know if the original draft had any redeeming features as so many appear to have tinkered with it. Needless to say...It's a mess. A complete and utter mess. The film doesn't seem to know what it's about. Justice in the 21st Century? I don't think so. The lead characters are cartoons. The ending...as so many have said...utterly disappoints.Where does it all go wrong? Well, where to start? As a revenge thriller it is a flop largely because the main protagonist is a one dimensional psycho. The lawyer and his family I couldn't care less about. So what is left? People get killed and you don't care. The multi-millionaire, special agent, brainiac hero/villain manages to predict which prison he will be housed in and preempts his incarceration by tunneling in beforehand. On and on goes the preposterous nonsense.Take it from me, its one big pile of poo. Don't waste valuable hours of your life. Crappola of the 1st degree. The end.",4,3,5,9 April 2012
