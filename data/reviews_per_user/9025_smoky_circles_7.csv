Catch Me If You Can," The most saccharine, sentimental depiction of sociopathy, ever
","Frank is a con-(young)-man. He cashes fake checks totaling up to millions, cheats and lies his way into several professions, and charms several women onto his sheets...but that is just because he is a lonely, lost boy, because his father was always in money trouble, and he had a broken home. He writes sentimental letters to his father, offers him expensive gifts, and talks about his mother rejoining them. He is actually a genius, see, and, when given the chance, proves himself to be virtuous by helping the authorities. And he has good, honest, hardworking potential too!! -- he passed the bar exam all on his own after loads of studying. This movie struck me as so false throughout that I couldn't help but see through it and overcompensate for its dishonesty and false sentimentality by continuously re-imagining it: what might REALLY have happened? How sociopathic might Frank have been to lie, cheat and steal so easily and continuously? How many women might he have slept, really? And how many times did people catch on to him? A brief look at a wiki article proved my suspicions. Frank's first victim was his own father. He ran away from home and never looked back. He failed the bar exam several times and his passing may have involved bribery and other methods of cheating. After being placed in prison he tried to escape to Brazil but was caught repeatedly. His cons sometimes failed as people suspected his lies. If this story was even mildly hollywoodized, I would have been fine with it (and if the writing, acting and visuals weren't as bland). But it takes sentiment and dishonesty to the oomphth degree. Take for example the window scene near the end. It again reinforced the theme that Frank was just a lost and lonely boy who committed all these crimes because he missed his mother. And the cheesy label-removing motif. That was just a waste. Tom Hank's character was worst at the beginning when he was going room to room shouting comically and trembling like an old lady. He got slightly better at the end. Leonardo's character was as I mentioned unnatural and flat, so I guess he made the best of it. The female characters were very fake and comic-booky and annoying, yelling 'yes, yes' during the sex scenes or crying after being yelled at by their boss and falling bashfully head over heels for the guy who comforts them. The worst offenders might have been the FBI and law enforcement folk who were a bunch of bumbling cartoonish idiots, too shy to reach their arms over for a fork. There were also a whole bunch of random scenes that didn't give anything to the movie. Some, like the prostitute scene seemed to be out of nowhere and would have fit in more if the whole movie wanted to show Frank as mildly sociopathic (which would have been more realistic). The one scene that I did like was when the agent came to France to see Frank's setup. Money flying everywhere and tilted camera angles gave it a cool look. But even then you are given the dishonest condition of Frank in stress and somewhat unraveling, a condition which screams at you, 'hey! look! look how worn out and rambling he looks! This criminal spree is taking a toll on him too, you know. He does have a heart!'",3,4,10,9 January 2009
The White Ribbon," 'You must be very unhappy to be so mean'
","A very sinister and disturbing work, fittingly shot in black and white, 'The White Ribbon' quietly and insolubly shows a hand-me-down chain of wickedness and cruelty. Those who are powerful suppress and abuse the weak, who in turn do the same to the weaker.Simplicity of style, and the eerie black and white cinematography, often only showing the bare minimum, compounded to my frustration with the characters.Although incomplete, the story is still presented in a way that in your gut you know, you just know, what happened and who did what.This is an interesting movie exploring not what happened before WW2, but what happened before WW1 to cultivate a generation that was bred on 'malice, envy, apathy and brutality.'",7,0,2,17 June 2012
Frozen," The best Disney princess movie of all time
","Technically, substantially and thematically amazing. What I liked best was that it was really a complete overhaul of the Disney Princess genre. With strong feminist underpinnings, celebration of both individual free will and communal cohesiveness, a more realistic and balanced perspective on love and romance, and a hilarious snow man, Frozen sets itself apart and can easily be seen as one of the all time best Disney movies.Although the spontaneous, unrestrained and effervescent Ana is not too different from the traditional Disney princess (she's a bit more naive and dorky though), the repressed, fearful and tormented Elsa is a new type of Disney princess. Elsa's display of power are probably a first in movie history, as she is one of the few Disney characters and possibly the only female character whose destructive power is not depicted as purely wicked, but as natural unwieldy talent. Her fear-fueled aggression and retaliation is also empathized with throughout, and although she takes the slot of the villain, she is never signed off as one.The ending has the best twist of all Disney movies. The saving act, the act of true love, is not a romantic act at all. In fact, romance and infatuation are rather discredited by the film itself. No, this movie shatters the long passed notion in movies, ranging from Snow White to The Matrix, of an act of romantic love literally saving a person's soul. Here, the act of true love is not the dependent and precarious reception of a romantic gesture, but the active and brave performance of an altruistic deed. And that just really sets this already amazingly well animated, well characterized, and well written film as one of the best animated movies of all time and the best Disney princess movie of all time.",10,3,11,22 December 2013
Kick-Ass," Fun and silly
","Liked the stylized violence, light-hearted/headed upbeat shootouts and kill-'em-alls. Hit-girl obviously the most interesting element since she fitted perfectly into the unexpected-hero mould; in fact, she fit it better than the tediously boring main character. That's what I couldn't care the less about: the mandatory nerdy-white-teenager role and all that it typically involves. Low rating because the ending was totally disappointing and compromised the deliverance of a good bang at the end for the redemption of the nerdywhiteteenager as a hero. The ending was really more of a petering out than a resolution. Overall: fight scenes with technically great with good music and style, hit-girl's character was fresh and amusing. Rest was typical and boring 'nerdy-teen becomes superhero and discovers inner strength' type stuff.",5,1,7,10 December 2010
The Hurt Locker," Excellent movie but is it misunderstood?
","I saw this movie when it first came out, and absolutely loved it -- that is, my opinion, expressed below, is not swayed by hype, awards, etc. That said, I'm surprised that this movie is getting so much flack in the comments here. Many are complaining that this movie is not realistic: very few movies/ war movies/ movies about war are, but since many of us are actually living through the Iraq war, it is easy to point out inaccurate details. Still, it's a movie, it should NOT be taken as a documentary. (Deer Hunter, Apocalypse Now, and Full Metal Jacket: which of these is at all realistic?). And if one ignores the inaccuracies, this movie is absolutely amazing. For me, although it remained silent politically and morally, it really bluntly addressed the question that almost 99% of all action movies avoid to answer honestly: it answered the question, 'why do they do it?' Countless (hollywood) movies are devoted ONLY to the depiction of the conquest of a powerful male over an equally powerful enemy. Their motivation can be anything from altruism to saving a loved one. Hurt Locker answered this question in a rather original way (ie, they do it because they like it -- war is a drug). For the people who say it is boring -- I can only imagine that they thought ice cream was boring when they were children. The scene where James pulls up a wire-- and five bombs, connected to it, surface...and then he says 'interesting' -- that scene is amusing, hilarious and cutting in how tense it is. It is a great scene among many other great scenes. Take the famous slow motion explosion as well. When you look at a mediocre movie like Sherlock Holmes, where a massive explosion makes you feel nothing visceral or mental, and when you look at the showering and ripples of gravel in the explosion in the hurt locker, you know which movie towers over the other. I am also very surprised by the subjectivity of judgment this movie is inducing in people. Comments are either complaining about the movie depicting soldiers as loathsome and brutal, or as overly cool and virtuous. To me, the characters were neither truly good nor evil, and very much built around the idea of an action movie (in fact, one can say that Hurt Locker is more about the idea of an action movie than it is about the Iraq war). They do not express tender emotions, and their morals are largely the morals of someone built for war and conflict: they do not shrink from fighting and killing. Sure, these are the traits of psychopaths, but they are really the hallmarks of most action movies, except most action movies also have another thing to balance out the bloodlust: the people being killed are 'evil.' Hurt Locker is not a contemplative movie, it is not uplifting, and it not the depiction of a fight between good and evil. It is a depiction of pure conflict and violence, from an arbitrary side and of a more or less arbitrary individual. My best guess is that this movie annoyed people because there was no one really to root for or comfortably identify with. Greenzone (which is a darn good movie) might be better for them, I guess.",10,3,16,18 March 2010
Prisoners," Tense and dreary thriller with some contrivances
","This was a tense and at times frightening movie. There are times throughout the film, except for the ending, where it almost seemed like a symbolic, supernatural crime mystery. The ending is satisfying, however, too neatly packaged for everything that came before it to have lasting impact.It has some truly amazing performances. Paul Dano once again delivers another eerie and uncomfortable performance. Favorites like Hugh and Jake also impressively portray stark characters. Hugh Jackman's portrayal of a stoic, independent and religious man seems to capture the spirit of the quintessential American man.The plot, although it has good effect, also has a lots of -- 'and then his eye caught that, and that solved everything!' -- moments that are a staple of average detective mysteries. There is however a thematic and symbolic undercurrent throughout the movie that really sets it apart from the average of this genre. However, this good theme is somewhat spoiled by a very literal explanation the villain gives near the end.Overall though, I was biting my nails and completely enthralled by it.",8,1,1,26 November 2013
Prometheus," A fun alien movie
","Let's see this movie for what it is: a fun, gross, beautiful alien movie.And, like its predecessors Alien and Aliens, this one is all about provoking and messing with our sense of being contained, clean and whole.Various creatures bearing remarkable resemblances to the male and female reproductive organs attempt to penetrate, strangulate and grow inside the largely unsuspecting crew, especially in places where we would definitely not want aliens to be. All of this is packaged in a light and amusing story related to the origin of human life on earth.(Some aspects of this movie's Panspermic theory, in particular how it focuses on human existence and totally ignores all other life forms on earth and their close relation to humanity, caused this biologist to giggle freely.)The visuals are gorgeous. I loved the huge, magnificent, carved walls and statues. Also really liked the atmosphere of the planet and its caves. The ship was super expensive. Nothing looked cheap or tacky. I liked how gooey and icky and obviously-organ-derived the aliens were. You could really see the money dripping.I loved the cast. I was totally rooting for them, specially Naomi Rapace's character, as she ... took care of herself... (audience members who are trained in physiology would giggle freely at those scenes, I suppose). Micheal Fassbender himself has said that he does 'creepy and weird well,' and, boy, does he ever. On one side I was awed and mesmerized by David (Fassbender), played perfectly by a robot....No, that was wrong, he played the robot perfectly -- but my error only proves how well Fassbender does it (amazing actor, by the way). David is cool, precise, highly capable, very charming, and incredibly confused. Although everyone keeps telling him that he can't feel anything, being a robot and all, we can all see that, indeed, he can definitely feel somethings.... And these somethings are what, on the other hand, kind of made me cautious and suspicious of David. Other than those two, I thought the Captain of the ship was cool, and that other woman played by Theron with aggression and crankiness was also cool.A sequel is promised at the end, which is kind of an irritating way to end, but I still found it better than the 'and then they got back to earth safe'-endings. I suppose one could find themselves ultimately mislead by the very promising, mysterious tone of the start of the movie and also possibly by the advertising, as it promises the explanation of the meaning of everything (in a sci-fi tone, of course). I think it's actually kind of cute how this particular installment in a long line of cheesy alien movies feathers up to be akin to 2001: A Space Odyssey. I think that's one of the reason it was a lot of fun.",8,0,8,15 June 2012
