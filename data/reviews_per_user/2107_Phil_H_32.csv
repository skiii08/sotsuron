The Blair Witch Project," Hardly worth waiting for.
","I wanted so much to love this movie.  After all the hype, the good press, and the other reviews available, I really wanted for this film to somehow profoundly affect me, either by scaring the living crud out of me, or to give something to me that no other film has been able to do in the past.This film, sadly, does not deliver.There is absolutely nothing that distinguishes this film from any other horror genre fare.  There's some tension, that's well produced as you hope to discover what it is that's going on, but in the end that's all there is--tension.This could have been so much better.  For all the hype, this SHOULD have been so much better.  As an avid moviegoer perhaps I'm jaded, but I just do not see what the big deal is with The Blair Witch Project.  When reviewing a movie for the IMDB, I have the duty to make an accurate assessment, sometimes I have to take a bit longer to come to my senses and resist the urge to issue forth praise that is unwarranted (in my opinion). Most of the positive feedback this film has garnered is just that: unwarranted priase.Anyone truly scared by this film has either a weak constitution or has never seen some of the truly great films of the horror genre.  To those people, I suggest (strongly) that you hit the local video store more often.  And in your renting you will find films that will make the Blair Witch Project pale in comparison.The Blair Witch Project will not withstand the test of time.",3,0,1,8 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I'll be blunt...
","sub-par plot + uninteresting characters + low-key action = inferior film. Not nearly as good as Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back, or Return of the Jedi.  Totally unworthy of being the first film in an otherwise stellar franchise.",6,1,3,19 May 1999
Ali," The point is?...
","I like (the man), Ali. I like the sport. I love what Ali did for the sport, but I could have learned just as much about him by watching old ABC Sports reruns. This was a hollow shell of a movie, there really was little here.Will Smith did an EXCELLENT job with Ali's mannerisms, voice, and look. For a while it was like looking at the Ali of old. Good job.But even with that, this film flounders. No real direction, no real insight. Too bad. I would have loved to have actually learned something about the man. Instead we get a rundown of his career up to Foreman. And that's barely half the amazing things he accomplished! I wanted more. Ali deserves more.Make no mistake, Ali is THE champ. Too bad this movie is not.",3,1,2,7 January 2002
The Ring," What's the deal with foreign cinema?
","I've seen lots (and I mean *lots*) of foreign movies, and almost without exception, they suck. Badly.Then comes (from Japan) a remake of 'Ringu,' called 'The Ring.' I've never heard of 'Ringu,' so I look some information up on it. It sounds promising, even though the basic idea is kind of silly, but with the suspension-of-belief in full-off mode I figure, why not, it is just a movie.Apparently, 'Ringu' and 'The Ring' are pretty close to one another (I'm not about to go learn Japanese so I can really find out.)If that is true, then 'Ringu' is garbage as well. Because 'The Ring' is truly worthless junk. Plot? Oh, no, can't be bothered with one that makes sense (even with my belief suspended). Acting? Lame. And where does one find kid actors with creepy eyes? Do they have a cattle-call for ugly?Shocks? Ok, one or two, but only because of the use of LOUD (and repetitive) sounds. Scary? Nope. Stupid? Yep. This movie belongs in the class of 'Jeepers Creepers' and 'Blair Witch.'Thus I can tell you, from years of experience (also called abuse) from watching foreign movies that there still are only a handful of good movies coming out of the rest of the world, whereas in the USA we beat their annual total each year, and still have time to produce drek (like 'The Ring.')Stay away from 'The Ring'. Before you die of boredom, you see 'The Ring.'",3,0,1,10 November 2002
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Stunning.
",I remember when I first saw Raiders of the Lost Ark...Over 2 dozen viewings later it's still one of my favorite films of all time. Even as a rerun on late night TV.Simply Amazing. I cannot do justice to this movie.  I love it.,8,0,0,13 September 1999
Finding Neverland," Excellent in every way.
","Although this review contains no real spoilers, I will mark this as having some to be on the safe side. But I bet you know the tale already, it is after all about 'Peter Pan.' This is a movie of loss and gain; of boys that grow up too fast, and boys that never grow old; of wonder and cynicism; happy and sad. It's all that at the same time. It's excellent, and probably Depp's best role to date.I felt sorry for what happened to the characters, I worried, and I was happy when the children 'found themselves again.' I'm not sure how truly accurate the film is, but that doesn't matter: it is a film, and some suspension of belief is needed; and they never said this was a biopic.It isn't often that a film like this comes about. They're rare, like trips to Neverland by an adult, something to be cherished.Having said all that, this is still not a 'perfect' movie, the flaw is that I don't believe this will withstand multiple viewings, but I could be wrong. Pathos aside, this is a good film, excellent even; but not worthy of too high a rating. It would be a disservice to rate this too highly, and equally so too low; so I have to give it a nice, round, '6' out of '10.' Still, you should see this. It's worth the price of admission.",6,3,6,30 December 2004
Akira," The greatest Japanese animated film ever.
","Akira stands alone at the pinacle of Japanese animation. No film that precedes it or any film that has come after has come remotely close to the style, quality, vibrance, and skill of Akira. It is just that good.My opinion: Get the subtitled version (Widescreen, if you can), you see more and get more of the underlying plot elements that way. It's superior to the English dubbed version.I doubt that any Japanese animated film will ever top Akira, or if it does, then that will be something to see!",7,0,7,19 September 1999
Monster," Mediocre Movie filled with great performances
","`Monster' is a film filled to the brim with great performances, but is handicapped by it's slow motion and lackluster cinematography. Many times I sat in the theater on the edge of bored-only to be aroused by the talent displayed. Then it was back to the same old thing. There were moments of insight and clarity, but it was too far between them.Although I cannot expect every film to blow me to the back of my seat with every shot, I was expecting something more considering the fact that the entirety of the subject matter could fill volumes about Eileen's life.Instead, she was a plain old hooker with a gun. Maybe that's how she really was, but it wasn't quite enough.Theron's OSCAR notwithstanding, there's really no meat to this film. Surely, she deserved the award; however, I find it sad that she had to win it for this particular piece of cinema.Really, I can't say that this is a bad film; only that it is not a great film, which is bad enough considering the talent arrayed.I can only give this a `5' out of `10,' making this just average.  `Monster' is indeed a film filled with great roles, but the wrapping wasn't enough for it.",5,0,2,31 May 2004
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," Formulaic yet funny
","This movie follows in exactly the way you sort of expect it will, but is still funny. There's nothing truly 'bad' here; conversely, there's nothing truly 'wonderful' here either. I would have to say this is average fare for the genre.That doesn't mean you won't enjoy it. I laughed many times at some of the antics. I also groaned a couple of times at the schlock. All in all, I could have thought of worse ways to spend my time (and money.)If you want a light-hearted romantic comedy, then this is definitely for you. If you want something new to be brought to the genre, then this is not your movie. All in all, still worth seeing. I give this a '5' out of '10', average, but not being pulled in either direction.",5,0,0,9 February 2003
The Mummy," goofy fun
","Ok, so this isn't Raiders of the Lost Ark, but it is a fun movie.  Lots of action, plenty of jumps for the easily scared, nice graphics to ogle at and a (in my opinion) genuinely fun idea (even if it is amazingly close to a short story I wrote several years ago....but that's another rant).So, I liked this film.  So did almost everyone else I know.  It's worth seeing...once.  And it fills the void until May 19th.Give it a look see and I think you'll agree.  Not gory, just Saturday morning type fun.",6,0,0,11 May 1999
Alien," a Classic of horror
","There is nothing to be said, this film is more than just a horror film, it's become a whole subsegment of our own society. Lines, characters, ideas from this film have all worked their way into our collective consciousness. This film remains as powerful and vibrant now as it was when first released.  A masterpiece of filmwork.  Worthy of being in anyone's collection.",7,1,1,11 July 1999
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Now everything *really* begins
","Never mind the fact that this is 'Episode II,' the story really begins here, as all the previous information is now coming into play (Anikin becoming Darth Vader, the birth of the Empire, where the Death Star came from, etc.)
This is an admirable *real* beginning to the whole saga. This is better than 'Episode I' but only because of the plot thickening.And, yes, Yoda is just that awesome...I know you've read that before...But even then, the next installment (Episode III) has a lot to cover. And Lucas has 3 short years to do it. We'll just have to see what happens then, but it is clear that everything that was planned to make the Empire eliminate the Republic took decades of planning. This was not a fluke, it was well orchestrated. Yet I sense there will be unplanned events (note: I'm no Jedi, but rather I can see where things are going, and I know how the tale ends...)Is this worth seeing? Sure, if you're a fan, you've probably already seen it (maybe twice!). Is it going to be the best of the series? I don't think so.As other's have reported, some of the dialog is stilted. But not to badly. Anikin's pathetic talk to Amidala is clearly written to show that he simply has no idea what to do or how to act around the woman he loves. I know how he feels. (Luckily, I don't have Jedi powers.)Ok, enough about that...what about the action?  Ahh. The action. There's lots of it. The screen is never still. The pace doesn't really relent. This is a thrill-ride for most of the movie. Pretty good stuff.I won't continue on other than to say, if you're a fan, go see. And you'll learn where things REALLY began...A good '6' out of '10.'",6,0,2,17 May 2002
"Monsters, Inc."," Superior to all previous Pixar films
","When I first saw Toy Story, I was amazed. When I saw Toy Story 2, I was stunned. Those are Pixar's 'masterpieces,' or rather were their masterpieces.Monsters, Inc. has taken the title of masterpiece easily. I have no idea how they can possibly top this. What makes it all the more impressive is the consistent internal logic the film uses, the sheer attention to detail, and the humor. It is also worth mentioning that this is rated as it is for a good reason, this film IS for everyone. It's totally wonderful. I cannot wait for this to come out on DVD home video. If you have kids, if you were a kid, if you know a kid, or if you once saw a kid go see this movie. If you are an adult, if you will be an adult, or if you once saw an adult then you need to see this movie.It is just that good. It will withstand multiple viewings. It will withstand the test of time. I predict Oscar nominations galore.Fantastic.",7,0,2,4 November 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Worth the long wait.
","I waited a lifetime, literally, for this movie to be made. Ever since the first time I read the novels, I knew that it was only a matter of time until this epic was on the screen. I had no idea that I would have to wait so long.The wait was absolutely worth it. Peter Jackson doesn't skimp at all. The elves look right, the languages feel and sound correct to me, not at all interfering with the 'mind's eye' or 'mind's ear' that has already shown you the land, the people, and allowed you in some sense to hear the ancient tongues spoken. This is truly a film worthy of the legacy that J.R.R. Tolkien left us. I do not believe that he would be upset in any important fashion. The acting was, well, spot on. The landscapes were breathtaking, and the whole vision that Jackson is bringing to life is so filled that I now know that nobody else would have done such a wonderful job.If you love the books, if you love the characters, then this is a must see for you. If you love fantasy, but simply found 'The Lord of the Rings' to be too much to consume, then this is the easiest way for you to digest its majesty. And when you get to the novels you'll see that there is more that awaits you. Nobody is disappointed in this excruciatingly faithful adaptation. Even the details, and plot points, that were left out are gone for reason: they detracted from the root of the plot. If it wasn't in the line of the main story, Jackson cut it out. Cutting out anything from Tolkien is tricky work, but the pruning was left at just the right amount. Amazing.I sincerely felt that this movie was not the length that it was. But the clocks didn't deceive. It simply moves so well that I still can't imagine how it was done. Usually, unless it is a movie of incredible stature, like 'Gandhi' or 'Shindler's List,' the length would become a detraction. But here it is not.  This is proof alone that The Fellowship is a movie of great stature.There is little that I can add to the great reviews already here, except to give my vote and to tell you this: go see this movie.But how do I rate it? Will this movie withstand multiple viewings? I believe so. Is it of such quality that it will last as a testament to Peter Jackson and engage Tolkien fans for years to come? I think so. Will all following fantasy movies be measured against this, as the novels are used as the yardstick that fantasy writing is measured with? Probably.  Is it cinematic perfection? No, it is not.And that is why I cannot, and will not, give this movie a '10' rating. But that should not dissuade you from seeing how absolutely wonderful this is.As I look at the listing of votes that I have made for various movies, the list is intact and all films are rated to near perfection. Once I leave my vote, I do not change it unless something drastically changes my perception of a film. Anything less is an insult to the film and to anyone who sees the IMDB as a valuable resource.Up until now, there has been only one movie that is at the pinnacle of the chart, only one film worthy of a '9' rating from me.  This is the question before me: is The Fellowship worthy of sharing that spot?To say 'yes' places this movie at, literally, the top of the craft; making it a film that experts will and must debate forever. It must be as good a movie as I could possibly imagine. There can be no flaws that I myself cannot justify in the name of the craft. It must be, by the very definition, the ultimate in achievement, with little room for any improvement. It must be, to me, a Tour de Force of all things cinematic.To say 'no' by no means places this movie in a league of unwelcome company. There are movies that are adored by more than me that I have given an '8'. Many movies I have given an '8' to are so good that I could not imagine being without them. Certainly, The Fellowship is in this class, at least. Indeed, once this is available on DVD I will possess it; placing this movie in a class that is by itself valuable: my collection.So now it comes down to it: '8' or '9'. <Insert a three day pause>My vote is '9'. Such a good job was done that there is little reason to not give it praise. I only wonder what I shall do if 'The Two Towers' and 'The Return of the King' are better by leaps and bounds.",9,2,3,28 December 2001
American Beauty," Kevin Spacey Rules!
","Great dialog, interesting setting, bizarre happenings, and just plain fun went into this move. Let's also not forget the shooting of the film itself was also well done.With all that, a fine outing for any adult to see.  But at this writing, reviewers here have given this a '9' rating. This movie doesn't deserve a '9,' although it is good.  Kevin Spacey is just a hoot. But even his performance doesn't deserve a rating that close to perfection.  A '7,' yes; a '9,' no way.Great fun to watch. I recommend this fully. But even with that, I don't expect this movie to remain in my area for long. It's just a wee bit out there for the average film-goer.But don't let that scare you off. This is really a good film.",7,0,1,1 October 1999
Being John Malkovich," Weird and charming, in its own sort of way.
","There is only one other film that I can compare this to: Brazil; and Being John Malkovich is clearly superior to Brazil. I suggest you see this film if for no other reason but for it being almost totally unique in the world. Comparing this movie to anything is almost a disservice to it. It's just that different. Certainly, not for everyone.",7,0,0,5 December 1999
Spider-Man," The curse of Marvel Movies has ended!
","I said to myself, 'Self, this movie better be better than any of the previous Marvel crud.''You said it,' came the reply.I wasn't long in discovering that this movie does live up to the hype, and that Spider-Man is a worthy summer blockbuster, what's more there *WILL* be sequels, you can believe that, True Believers.Is this the best it could have been? Well, no. Because the sappy ending seemed tacked-on (I bet you've read that before someplace.) And some of the action editing was a bit glaring, and I could tell when the Spider-Man was CGI and not a human...But still, the curse is indeed over. This movie rocked. If you're a Spider-Man fan, you'll love the integration; if you have no clue who Spidey is, then you'll learn and you'll love him. This is good stuff.I had misgivings that Tobey McGuire would be bad, that he wouldn't make me think he was Peter Parker. But actually, he did ok. I was concerned that he might not be animated enough to pull off the wise-cracking web-slinger. But he kind of grows into the role, as if Peter's new-found confidence is letting him take off a bit more. I see that as a positive thing.Go see Spider-Man, it's good. I give it a solid '6.'",6,0,1,4 May 2002
Spirited Away," Don't believe the hype
","I just saw `Spirited Away' (Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi), and have to tell you that this is no `Akira.' Although the animation is crisp, clear, and flawless for what it does it breaks no new ground and doesn't deliver what I would consider an Oscar-worthy performance. The plot, if one can call it that, is thin; amounting to very little. This is Japanese `Alice in Wonderland' on hallucinogens.I'm completely at odds with all the rave reviews: this doesn't deserve any of it. I suggest everyone take a deep breath, and step back from being an otaku for just one second and rethink their viewpoints. For the uninitiated, this is pure fantasy gibberish. I have no choice but to give this movie sub-par ratings because of the plot-which is practically nil. I gave it the rating I did only because it is wonderfully colored and next to Akira is as flawless as anime will ever get; but at the same time its non-existent plot breaks the whole thing apart, and what you're left with is  well  nothing. It's all style and no substance.I give this a `4' only because it shows how good Japanese anime can look. Pity it was hobbled by not having a story worth sitting through.",4,10,31,16 April 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Amazing and worthy of acclaim.
","Following my review of `The Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring' I waited a year for `The Two Towers.'It was worth the wait.  I shall not write a massive review like I did for the predecessor, but rather I will say this: Peter Jackson does it again. `The Fellowship of the Ring' was granted by me a score of `9,' making it a film worthy of the highest honors, yet it was not perfect.`The Two Towers' is in the same ranking--imperfect, yet amazing and equally worthy of acclaim. I am in the (not so) sad position of having to give this movie a `9' score as well. Marking the first time, I believe, that I have found a series to have not dwindled in value, production, or in the nebulous `fun factor.' Really, this isn't that surprising since `The Two Towers' was filmed simultaneously with `The Fellowship of the Ring.'Therefore, I say: go, get in line now. See it; take somebody who will appreciate it. Enjoy.This movie is wonderful. Score: 9 out of 10. It's a modern classic, just like `The Fellowship of the Ring.'",9,0,1,22 December 2002
Schindler's List," The best movie ever made.
","Although I didn't give Schindler's List a '10' rating for the IMDB, in fact I gave it a '9', I must say this: Schindler's List is the best movie ever made.The horror of the genocide is made clear, as well as the potential humanity of onlookers.  One powerful message--that people can make a difference. Good people can, and do, save lives everyday.There's a tag-line for the film, it's from the Talmud, 'Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire.'  If so, then Schindler just saved the world 1200 times.  He saved it for you, for me;  for all of us.I have seen many films, fiction, documentary, and otherwise that deal with the horrors of the Holocaust.  Nothing moved me as this has.  I've seen Schindler's List many times.  I love it.  It never fails to move me.We need more people like Schindler, we need more movies like Schindler's List.",9,9,13,24 August 1999
For Love of the Game," Long, overwrought, uninspired.
","First, let me get this off my chest: I hate baseball. Really. To me it's a dull thing to watch. A movie about baseball, to me, is about as exciting as getting a rigid sigmoid-colonoscopy.It's a darn good thing that this movie really isn't about baseball, rather it's about relationships, loyalty, love, and the difficulties that come along with them.I must admit that this film *almost* works.  Costner, is getting more back on track after such dismal films as 'The Postman,' and 'Waterworld,' but he's still not back to where he was with the perennial favorite 'Field Of Dreams.'  If the love interest could have been more believable; or if the film would have been more interesting to watch on the whole, it would have been superior.  This film could have become a great 'end of summer' release, sadly it falls just short of acceptible instead.  Almost as if this film 'settles' for second best.  Pity.",4,0,2,18 September 1999
The Dark Knight," Not worthy of #1
","I am about to become a pariah amongst my friends. I am a fan of movies in general, a fan of comics overall, and a big fan of comic movies. Having just returned from 'The Dark Knight,' I can now say that this movie is not worthy of the absolute obedience and hype that has surrounded it since Heath's unfortunate demise.Make no mistake, Heath's performance was brilliant and suitably creepy and zany--as the Joker ought to be. This is, in my opinion, his finest role and portrayal, and he will no doubt receive a best supporting actor Oscar (and had he lived, I'm sure he still would receive this award.) Mr. Bale's performance was....well, the same as 'Batman Begins,' that is to say: gruff and gravely while in-costume, and idle playboy when not...which a touch of golden heart. More of the same of what we have previously seen. Nothing new to report.The rest of the cast was as good as could be hoped.People are giving this movie a very high score, and to be utterly honest, this isn't worthy of such praise. Heath was absolutely wonderful, other than that this is pretty much a wash for average.I was entertained, which is great; but this isn't the be-all of cinema and most certainly does not deserve the #1 spot. There are better movies out there.I give this a '6', which isn't a bad score to give; but it isn't as high as what many have given. This means only one thing: they are deluded. They're giving the score out of remorse for the loss of Heath, not for the film as it is.In the end, 'The Dark Knight' is good, but just not great.",6,3,10,26 July 2008
Eyes Wide Shut," Kubrick's finale
","This film is being touted as 'Stanly Kubrick's final, hanuting, masterpiece...'Rubbish.Of the above, 'Eyes Wide Shut' meets only these: Kubrick made it and it's his last film.This film fails to deliver anything other than a lot of Nicole Kidman in the buff, and strange pseudo-porn wrapped in sexual dysfunction.This is not worth seeing, even if the cut 65 seconds were to be restored,
In a word, worthless.  Along with 'Summer of Sam' these are the two worst films of 1999 so far.",1,12,18,19 July 1999
The Matrix Reloaded," Not what was expected
","*****SLIGHT SPOILERS AHEAD*****I was fortunate enough to be able to view Matrix Reloaded on Wednesday at a sneak preview show here locally.After the block-buster of The Matrix, I expected Reloaded to be more than the first: more impressive, more expansive, and just plain more.What you get, in reality, is just more of the same. Not better, just an extension of the first movie (which is what was planned.) However, that's not great--and certainly not what was expected. I expected to be blown into the back of my seat--I expected there to be richer and better special effects; but what we got was the same 'bullet time' leftovers from the Matrix. I find bullet time to be boring now, and need something better than this one 'catch effect' to impress me--and sadly, Reloaded has this in so many places that it's almost like they were hinging the whole film on it. That's insulting.I loved The Matrix, as did many; Reloaded isn't the Matrix. It's 'ok' but not 'great.' Had there been more substance to this fantasy I'd be a happier man.Agent Smith returns in mass--looking for 'purpose' to his now meaningless existence. I look for him to have a pivotal role in the final installment--shades of Gollum, perhaps?The fight scenes and the chase on the freeway were nice, but that does not make a movie. I have no choice but to give The Matrix Reloaded a '5', indicating it as average film-fare. The Brothers 'W' should have known better. The fans wanted more and were left wanting. Perhaps the final installment (due later this year) can redeem this otherwise mediocre effort.",5,0,0,15 May 2003
A Beautiful Mind," Superior and not at all what you think.
","Insanity and utter genius are so closely related that it is sometimes difficult to see where one ends and the other begins. John Nash was clearly both.Nash thought he would be able to 'solve the problem,' and find a form of cure for his disorder. But clearly if he was to medicate, he'd lose his gift. I agree with Nash: the gift is better to accept with the insanity then to accept the cure and lose the gift.I truly expected this movie to be a 'spy' movie. And as one other reviewer has pointed out, this isn't, and yet in a way is a spy movie. Albeit the spooks are only in Nash's mind.I recommend this film to anyone, including those who don't like Russell Crowe. Make no mistake, I disliked Gladiator, but this is different and shows range and emotion. Now, I can say that I don't dislike Crowe, but rather had a distaste for Gladiator.If you liked this film, do yourself a favor and go rent 'Pi,' these movies compliment each other and are worthy of being seen.Out of 10, I give 'A Beautiful Mind' a 6, marking it as a superior product.",6,0,2,14 January 2002
The Emperor's New Groove," Just wonderful
","I am at a conundrum... Do I give this movie a higher rating just because I liked it that much, or do I stick to my guns and hold to my standard rating system.  This movie was such great fun to see. The kids around me were laughing, the adults too.Disney does it again. I haven't had this much fun since .... since...I don't know when.  A wonderful movie, worthy of viewing. Held my attention, had good laughs, fantastic animation.... I think David Spade latched on to his perfect role here. And it was good seeing (well, hearing from, actually) Eartha Kitt again. She's a great villain. Loved her.Wonderful. Just wonderful.  But about my conundrum?... I'll stick to my guns and give it a solid '6'. That says a lot from me. Maybe, just maybe this will end The Grinch's rule at the boxoffice.Go see this, you'll be glad you did.",6,1,2,11 December 2000
Bruce Almighty," Glad it wasn't me with the power
","Occasionally, I've been known to utter things like 'If I were in charge,' and I must admit the idea of power is appealing I will equally admit that I am not capable of handling such powers as Bruce is given in this movie. We're all very fortunate that it wasn't me.That being said, we could have done worse than have God imbue Bruce with omnipotence. Naturally, with Carrey, hilarity ensues. But there is a great, and important, message in 'Bruce Almighty,' that being: be content and nobody (even God) is out to 'get you.' The idea that God would give such power to a mortal as a 'lesson' is great, and mankind not being to worldly the sort of messed up things that happen are pretty plausible--even if it is a comedy. I don't see this as an attack on beliefs, and I don't see this as your average Jim Carrey movie either; it's a little bit more than that. And that makes it more worthy of viewing than any other Jim Carrey movie to date. Sufficiently so that I believe I can say this might be his best work (even more so than The Truman Show.)Solid '6' out of '10.' There's a good story and it's pretty funny too. Check it out.",6,0,1,25 May 2003
Signs," The ads are deceiving...
","You think this is a thriller, that's only partly right. You think this is about crop-circles and aliens; and that's only part of the tale as well.What this is really about is losing one's faith. Losing love. Losing in general.The aliens, the crop-circles, the whole thing you see in the ads is just a decoy, a ruse if you will, to mask what's really going on.The ads say 'Don't see it alone.' I did. And everyone else in the theatre with me who was with someone didn't fare any better. We all saw the same thing.What we saw was a movie that was not as good as 'The Sixth Sense' or 'Unbreakable,' but was good on it's own merits. ...Well, except for the alien... That was a guy in a rubber suit and it showed.But again, the aliens were a mere backdrop; and a not very good one at that.'Signs' is clearly better than many movies out there, but not nearly as good as what we *thought* it would be. That's what really saddens me. SO much so I have to give this the lowest rating yet for Mr. Shyamalan.'5' out of '10,' and he gets those mostly for effort. True there are some jolts here and there, but that, in the end, just isn't enough for 'Signs' to warrant anything more. I would have liked to see the movie I thought this was going to be. So did everyone else who saw it with me.",5,0,1,3 August 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The tale is full in its telling. A finale worthy of praise.
","Long has the road been, and long have we traveled it. The circle of the saga is complete, the ring of Doom is destroyed and Middle-Earth is saved from the vile clutches of the Dark Lord.It has not been an easy trek, to be sure; we've seen some very majestic scenery; we've heard the words spoken that before were only intoned in our minds. Through it all, we stood our ground with Aragorn, Boromir, Gandalf, Gimli, Legolas, Sam, Pippin, Merry, and Frodo. Truly we are also a part of the Fellowship.Having seen now the long awaited conclusion to this epic trilogy, I left the theatre somehow wanting more. The ships sailed from the Grey Havens, the last of the Elves have taken their places in the Undying Lands, the age of Men has come  yet I so still wanted to see more.I wanted as well to see the battle of Eowyn and the Witch-King played out as it was written; I wanted to see Shelob in all her majesty. I was hoping that the final installment-that we have waited so very long to see-would be more true to the tale in those important places (well, they were important to me, at least.)At least I am proud to say that I saw King Aragorn kneel before the Hobbits in tribute. At least the Many Partings were relatively well displayed. And to hear Gandalf laugh! This is what I imagined. Indeed, it was like spring after a long winter; like water to a parched land.Pity, there was no Scouring of the Shire. No Saruman. No finale to the final film. For that I am sad.How I wished to utter perfection. Only to leave wantingStill, I will not weep over the ending, nor the telling of the tale. A marvelous ride it has been. So that leaves me with the paramount question: how good is it?It's good. Better than most films; but it's not as good as I had hoped it would be. Thus it cannot obtain a `10' rating. But is it on par with the other two? If you recall, I gave both The Fellowship and The Two Towers a `9' ratinghigh praise, indeed.The Return of the King feels like a hollow victory, in a sense, because I know that next year there is no sequel to tide me. Quite lamentable. I can only hope that Peter Jackson will acquire the rights to The Hobbit after his version of King Kong is finished.  But I digress..Surely, this is a good film, the main points of the novel are covered and the quest is brought to the ending as it should.  In the end, I think, the finale is just as good as the others in the trilogy, and it is only my own sadness that we shall not see another next year that makes me hesitant.In my heart of hearts I know this tale is completed, full, and as near a vision to Tolkien's masterwork that could possibly be hoped. And it is with that feeling I shall follow. If you are a fan, or just a story completeist, then you must see this. This is the culmination of your desires and hopes. It's solid, and I give this a `9' out of `10' making this series well worth owning, well worth seeing, and well worth the price. I will be seeing this again. I bet you will, too.",9,0,0,21 December 2003
A Night at the Roxbury," What can I say?....
","It's a bad film altogether, but I was filled with a morbid curiosity about the main characters; wondering what was going on in their world...and in their vacant heads.It's interesting to see but only for Chris Kattan. Utterly forgettable otherwise...and the dance music is just plain annoying.",4,2,7,2 November 1999
The Matrix," Keanu is stupidly beleavable
","Before I begin, let me say this: I am not a fan of Keanu Reeves' acting ability.  Short of 'Bill & Ted' movies, he hasn't found a niche yet (in my opinion).  I went to see this film on the advice of several people whose opinions are valuable to me.  What I found was that Keanu's normal stupidity actually was believable here!  This film (for Keanu) works! Really.I was impressed with all the acting, the effects, and even with Keanu. This IS his best film to date.Is this film as good as the rating makes it sound? No.  I reserve an '8' rating for films like 'The Empire Strikes Back,' but this films isn't as bad as a '6'...by default I give it a '7.'  Could be a bit better, and could have been a LOT worse!See this film if:(1) you're a big Keanu fan. (2) you are a computer savy (IT professional) person (3) you like fire-fight scenes.",7,0,0,21 April 1999
The Godfather," Interesting but hardly great.
","Without a doubt, this is a good film. It's got great acting all around, a fine musical score, the cinematography is practically flawless; but it is still lacking in the most important area:It's still a movie that glorifies (or attempts to do so) the mafia.Yes, this film is *really* about family and loyalty, but in the end that becomes sort of sublimated and what you have is a story about criminals, the massive power they wield, and the destruction they cause to those around them.Hardly something worthy of praise. The Godfather is an interesting film, but it's hardly a great film.",6,6,15,23 August 1999
