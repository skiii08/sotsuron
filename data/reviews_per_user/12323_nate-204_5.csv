Skyfall," Really? Yes, a mindless, plot-less, lame action movie.
","So hard to come to terms that this was a sub-par movie at best. After Casino Royale and Qos I was expecting at least an average movie. Where to begin? (Spoilers coming) Him dying in the beginning with no explanation how he came back, spending so much time on dialog that doesn't advance the plot, a random scene with a random woman in bed for about 30 seconds, killing the next 'bond' woman without even any hint of sadness, a horribly-horribly predictable 'final bad guy battle'.... I could go on and on. Just so disappointed. I'm at a loss for how anyone could fully enjoy this movie. Honestly, you'd be much better off just watching Casino Royale again.",5,9,18,24 November 2012
Drive," The Town Meets The Straight Story
","I'm at a loss when I see the general user community rate 'Drive' with well over an 8 average rating. My summary says it best; this movie was like taking 'The Town' and slowing it down as much as possible making it seem like the 'Straight Story'. There are many scenes where at least 15 seconds (feels like 30) pass without much of any movement on the screen and no dialogue. Two hours of this and you feel like you're watching still photos instead of a real movie. I get the attempt at an artistic angle here, but staring at Ryan Gosling's face for what seemed like 45 minutes of this movie gets old fast. Plus, (spoiler) the random, gruesome murders don't fit the overall slow plodding feel of the movie. What's worse, is the plot seemed like a close sibling/rip-off to 'The Town' but with a worse ending. Actually, the movie ends worse off than it began without much of a point. The 'action' scenes were displayed to try and be intense; but left you thinking there was more that wasn't to be. Ryan Gosling had maybe 40 lines of dialogue and about two expressions, so trying to spin this as 'artistic' is purely euphemistic. Thus, my message to the general user community is - what were you thinking?",2,2,9,20 September 2011
Transformers," Great special effects; too bad Michael Bay directed it
","If you're a 15-year-old boy - this movie ROCKS! If you're in your 30's (like me) you're wondering why did he have to make this so cheesy? The special effects are worth seeing, but everything else is so 'campy'. The lead women are so good looking and done up - it's just funny, the dialog practically makes fun of themselves and the plot, well... See it for the special effects, but don't expect much else. (unless you're a teenage male)I was expecting more from Michael bay, but got what he delivers. Shooting, car chases, hot women, explosions, poor plot development and repeat.On the upside - it was great seeing transformers back in the mainstream after 20 years. :-)",5,2,6,9 July 2007
There Will Be Blood," I no longer trust the academy
","After watching this film, I'm at a loss. This film moves extremely slow, has a strange and painful 'soundtrack' and the ending left me wishing I could have my 2 1/2 hours back. There's nothing original here. Man gets greedy. Man gets nothing from it. The only redeeming quality of the movie was the stellar acting of the two lead roles. Otherwise, this film really was terrible. The film spends too much time focusing on on long, silent sequences that don't advance the plot. There's hardly any character to identify with. Again, to the academy, I'm at a loss as to why this was nominated for best picture. There are countless movies that take on this theme and do a much better job.",1,10,22,22 March 2008
Incredibles 2," Recycled 'magic' from the first movie that leaves you flat
","I'm such a big fan of the original movie and all the sequel did was try to recycle the same 'magic' from the first, but with nothing original. There's no compelling family story that's unique and the 'bad guy' is obvious. There's a lot of focus on Jack-Jack, but the original short was WAY funnier on how they handled it. Worst of all, Edna did not have one funny line. Lame writing, OK movie.",5,0,2,23 June 2018
