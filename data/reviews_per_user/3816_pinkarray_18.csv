Your Name.," Can you meet me halfway right at the borderline is where I'm gonna wait for you I'll be looking out night and day took my heart to the limit and this is where I stay
","While I was watching this movie, I kept wondering what in the world I was watching. t was so complex and fast that I couldn't follow it. I just couldn't understand what was going on in this movie. A girl and a boy is constantly switching bodies and I couldn't tell if the girl was herself or if she was the boy in her body.Now, I do not like complex, intense coming-of-age stories like this so I was worried I wouldn't like it but I decided to try it since a lot of people thought it was excellent but I didn't know it would be a coming-of-age story. It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be but I was still pretty disappointed. It was pretty iffy. It had a fairly interesting story because I like stories that focus on two characters with two different plots and I like the whole switching bodies thing but I just couldn't find myself relating to any of the characters. The characters can be rude and Mitsuha was also cloying. Taki was okay, but not great. I guess he was the only relatively interesting character out of this bunch.The movie had too much crying in it. The only solid thing about this movie was the animation and the voice acting, they were pretty lovely. Most of the music sounded good. But the writing and the directing just wasn't my cup of tea.The end was predictable, the girl and the boy cross paths and they are shown as grown-up. I did not get how they were able to cross paths.I found this movie to be highly overrated and do not get why people praise this movie so highly.",3,6,24,1 August 2017
It," Disappointing film with horrendous language and full of clichés
","After hearing about all the critical praise for it and because I like horror films, I decided to give this a try. The teaser didn't look so bad despite this being a remake. What I got was middle school kids bullying, ignorant parents, and children swearing throughout the whole film. All quite common and tiresome in fiction.Though, I'm not a fan of the violence portrayed in this film, that's not the only problem, though.I didn't care for any of the characters except possibly the villain Pennywise, he was the one who caused all the action in this film. I just couldn't root for the heroes because I didn't give a crap about them since they were constantly swearing throughout the film. I especially do not like how the language was used unnecessarily.The only fun parts were pretty much some of the action scenes. They were interesting and kept me on the edge of my seat.I missed the ending of the film because my mom forced me to leave early for a meeting that I didn't really want to go to and because she thought the movie was over. But there were a lot of previews for it.I haven't seen the original It so I don't know how this compares to it. But I know that remakes tend to not be as good as the original. So, I recommend Hollywood to stop making remakes to everything.Just skip this one and go watch Annabelle: Creation instead. Though, it's not great and even though it's grotesque, it's got a lot more likable characters, charming story and less clichés.",4,2,8,15 September 2017
Kung Fu Panda," Boring but has cute and cuddly characters
","Kung-Fu Panda is an above average film which tries to stay away from predictability and takes its time to show Po learning martial arts. The result at the end turns out not too bad, it uses Hollywood clichés in a pretty clever way, and even though some of the fight scenes don't work, it still is pretty good, though kind of boring. DreamWorks tries to regain the magic for the film that it had for Shrek but doesn't reach up to standards despite that their 7 years apart.The voice acting for Po sounds like nails-on-a-chalkboard sometimes especially in the beginning but then gets better. The animation is not the best but it still features cute and cuddly characters. It's funny.It's fast-paced but I still would try the sequels even though they may not seem necessary to me.Rating: 6.5/10",7,0,0,12 February 2016
Zootopia," Too long
","I don't get how people thought that this was so good, like I heard people saying 'This was better than Wreck it Ralph' or 'Wow, this is the best movie since Emperor's New Clothes or even 1990!'. After coming back from the theater, I didn't feel the same way as other people did. I thought that it had a nice story to it but the characters needed work.This was not better than Wreck it Ralph, though I gave both similar ratings but I thought the characters of Wreck it Ralph had more effort put into them. After seeing it the second time, I liked it more and it became my all-time favorite, although I was only 14 at the time, I thought that it was a nice break from seeing something overly intense or complex.Judy Hopps is a young bunny who was bullied as a child. Though, she still was determined and strong, she carried on with her wish on being a cop. Then, she meets a fox who had the same experience she had.Another small problem was the run time, kids may get bored off of a 108 minute run time. It's a comedy so being at 108 minutes long is too long. But it's still a nice break from something violent or really sad.",4,0,7,9 April 2016
Ready Player One," The Iron Giant? Where Hogarth at?
","Yes, I am ready to play this game.The trailers didn't do the story justice, I thought it was going to be a contrived story but it ended up better than I thought. The story is actually clever, thrilling and has an intense third act that will keep you on the edge of your seat. It will probably make video game fans wish that there was a VR Set or a theme park attraction based on the OASIS. The only problems I have with the story is that the main character is an orphan but I don't know if he is technically an orphan since he's 18, but it's a tiresome cliche to have nowadays. It's time to take a break from it, people. The other problem is that there are random, pointless random scenes in there such as at the beginning, when Wade narrates about the OASIS, the scene suddenly transitions to a 5 second scene of a hardcore little girl screaming on a bed.I thought that the whole premise of having much of the movie focus on the avatars these people are playing as was a refreshing idea. And I liked the crossovers that were in this movie, something that a lot of movies don't tend to do nowadays but I am a big fan of crossover films.One thing I am mad at is that there is no Iron Giant sequel. This is about as closest to a sequel as we can get.There are a few forced acting moments, sappy romance at the end, and the pop culture references can go overboard but problems aside, it was an alright film. I am a fan of video games and nostalgia so this was pretty much up my alley.",6,0,1,3 May 2018
Moana," The best Disney film I have seen in theaters since Frozen!
","This is probably the best movie released this year, though not the best Disney has put out in the last few years. I just hope it won't become the next Frozen because even though it wasn't as good as Frozen when it first came out, I'm worried that people might blow this up, saying, 'This is awesome!' and giddy kids will be talking about it, wanting to revisit this many times and singing the songs.The movie starts off as Moana, a brave baby goes out to the ocean, where it makes friends with her. Though, her father is suspicious about her going out there due to him thinking it's too dangerous. Moana annoyingly persists in stubborness to go out to the ocean as she grows up.Moana hears from her mother that her father doesn't want her going out there because of how wild the waves can get. And she did admit that she went a little too far out in the ocean when she is forced to seek the demigod by her dying grandmother.The minor characters are pretty mediocre. They don't stand out much from your typical animations and films. They got sensitive small children. They got the typical Disney tropes, like the relationship between Gramma Tala and Moana where Moana encounters Gramma Tala, who cheers up Moana when she thinks that she's not right for the ocean. It's forgettable.Moana's voice actor may have sounded a bit too mature, it may have been the director's fault, but I don't know.I don't usually like musicals, and while the songs may have sounded rather forced, they were still lovely songs to hear.Overall, I came out the theater feeling happy. This was such an energetic, action-packed, fun movie unlike Zootopia, which is more slow in pace and thought-provoking. I thought that it was better than Zootopia and it wasn't as dramatic/emotional as Kubo and the Two Strings (a little-known movie). I do still like the film even though the minor characters weren't particularly lovable.I thought I wouldn't like this film because from the trailer, I thought it looked a little too weird, but it was actually creative in a good way.",6,1,15,29 November 2016
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Insufferable main character
","The main character is a little aloof brat! I could not stand 10 minutes of this little brat whining and arguing and ignoring his father! He is so disrespectful. Maybe he gets better and I don't know what the original Miles was like but I don't care to watch anymore. I don't know why everyone finds him so likeable, he's so overrated. I know you two have different worldviews but be like Flint Lockwood and at least be more caring and try to respect your father, Miles.",2,4,8,8 December 2019
Monsters vs. Aliens," On the surface, it may appear clichéd but it's still very good
","Some people may not like Monsters vs. Aliens due to its references to B-movies, its corny jokes, and its simplistic characters. I was a little annoyed by B.O.B.'s idiocy and the other monsters are quite stereotypical but I wouldn't let that bring me down from enjoying the film.I thought that the character of Susan was really pretty and wasn't some sassy brat like some women are. She was sympathetic even to the alien. Though, I did have problems with her design, her nose was small and her eyes were big bug eyes.The team put in a lot of effort into the animation, making it turn out striking.The person who voiced Susan did a pretty good job with her character. She put a lot of emotion into her voice. And I also liked the person who voiced the other characters, too. They did a pretty good job of making them humorous and trying to capture their personalities.The dialogue on the other hand, is archetypal, though. Especially at the beginning. Once the story gets going, the movie gets way better and quite interesting.The movie was too short, it stopped at a cliffhanger. I wished they could've made a sequel of the movie from there. Also, there was not enough character development to Susan and her adjustment of being with the new monsters. Her finally knowing she doesn't need Derek felt a bit forced. But it had a lot of heart and action and some soul but not enough.While it's not as great as Shrek, it's still a good movie with high replay value and your kids will probably love it. The little ones might get bored but the older ones will love it. It was a very memorable experience to me and I think it would be a valuable film for the kids. It had a special place in my heart when I was a kid and words couldn't describe how much I loved the film. And Susan is still one of my favorite cartoon characters and I still really liked this movie.",7,2,3,26 January 2017
The Lego Movie," Not much special
","I found myself not engaged with the film as I was with 'The Boxtrolls', some of the CGI character design and animation for the heroes is your standard character design and animation like Disney. And it wasn't all that special, but it was more enjoyable than The Boxtrolls on many levels. But it should've been nominated for an Academy Award because it's better than 'Big Hero 6' also, that little-teen, generic movie. I found 'Mr. Peabody & Sherman' a better movie than The Boxtrolls and kept me engaged throughout despite a little brat in there. Unlike 'Big Hero 6', it actually makes you laugh throughout the film. It also makes you feel scared of the villain, pretty much the most well-thought out character I've seen in a while.I got this movie on DVD, expecting something cute and surprisingly breathtaking like 'Wreck it Ralph' but it was somewhat boring like 'Big Hero 6' with some entertaining parts. The movie is too weird like Emmet can get annoying with his talkative self and Unikitty (I don't remember much about her).The ending was an okay one, but it was just added in there as a cloying part. It was too sad, too, but then everything's okay.I don't think that many people over the age of 9 will enjoy this thoroughly.All in all, The Lego Movie is an overrated film that is not for everyone and I really recommend Wreck-it Ralph more. It was an engaging and hilarious film from start to finish that will be something to watch over and over again. Don't expect much special from it.",6,0,2,7 March 2015
Spirited Away," Spirited Away is annoying
","Spirited Away is annoying!The little girl needs to get hit with a spoon and pranked and for some reason, I want to kill her but that's not nice!The animation is gorgeous and the film is beautiful to look at.The film is probably best to watch at about 11-16.Sorry, find this film not worth watching. Watched it at a special screening and felt like running out! Chihiro cries too much, whimpers, and sobs throughout the whole movieAmy Rose and Cream are better!End of funny rant.",2,1,11,18 December 2015
Inside Out," It's no Up
","After Pete Doctor's better film, 'Up' comes this, where people were taking it that it may be Pixar's best idea ever. While the concept is enjoyable, it does have some characters that ranged from bad (Bing Bong, Riley's parents, Joy) okay (Riley, Anger) to great (Disgust, Sadness). I did like Riley as a toddler but as she grew up, she became too playful and typical for me. I also didn't think some of the emotions mirrored Riley's personality like how Fear gets scared easily because he's simply fear. And how Sadness cried over reflecting on Riley's memories.The movie was so complex that I was constantly zoning out, trying to figure out what's going on. It made me feel like I had to watch the movie again to figure out what this world that Riley had was about. I thought that it may have lingered on the emotions part a little too much, I liked how it swung back and forth from the real world to the emotions' world to show how Riley was doing.I found a lot of moments funny.The soundtrack was made by the same guy who made the music for Up. While the scenes may not have been as sad as Up, they were still making me hold back my tears.The middle act was when things got worse. The pacing was rather off and It got very sentimental, it had Riley finally crying to her parents, telling them how she missed Minnesota and Joy crying when she misses all the good times with Riley. But she had to understand that she needed sadness, too. And Riley was a bad kid for running away and taking her parents' credit card. And also, it showed Bing Bong, an annoying imaginary friend who cries candies.It also ended abruptly, where Riley is 12 and she has finally adapted to San Francisco. I wish that I could see how she adapts to San Francisco.I had to talk to my parents to try to understand the movie and I understand it's not supposed to be about Riley and that Pixar usually makes emotional movies but it was still too sentimental.Hopefully, there will be a sequel explaining all of the new islands she had and how she'll grow from a teenager, becoming an old lady to show what life is like as you struggle to grow up.The animation was pretty good except Riley's nose was too big, and the voice acting was fine while Riley's newcomer (Kaitlyn Dias) was okay.",6,3,23,7 July 2015
Coco," Interesting Pixar Film
","Coco is a nice surprise from Pixar. I have seen that they had slumped with Brave, which was a poor film but they have improved since with Inside Out and then slumped again with the mediocre Good Dinosaur. I haven't seen their recent sequels such as 'Cars 2' so I can't comment on them. Coco, I think is a pretty good film.I'm a big fan of music and that's one of the reasons why I like this film, it focuses on how a boy aspires to be a musician and he loves music. It helped me to connect with the film more because of my love for music. Though, I'm not big on Mexican culture, but this movie helped me appreciate the Day of the Dead thing. It made me want to go to Mexico on Day of the Dead to see what it's like. It has a really interesting depiction of Day of the Dead, even if it's a fantasy. It's like The Book of Life in its art and writing but it's done better.What's the problem with the film? Well, I do think it had a little too much emotion in it, it was pretty evident from the beginning. I'm not a fan of dramas so I don't like the amount of emotion this film has. Pixar is known for emotional films but they also tend to put a good amount of humor in their films, and this film didn't have much in the way of laugh-out-loud moments and it didn't have much action in it (and I also happen to like action), the action was more calmer, so that's what keeps me from rating the film very highly. I also don't like how the character of Miguel tends to lie and that he lives in a family that forbids music.This is a cute film. It's a charming Pixar film, I just could do with a little less drama and it was predictable, I also predicted in the end that the grandmother was going to die because she looked so old, like she was like 90 or 100. It's not scary or dark, I think it's appropriate for kids to watch.",6,3,18,25 November 2017
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs," Cloudy with a Chance of Tastiness
","Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs never fails to put a smile on my face. It has some clever jokes with some sweet messages about being yourself and solving world hunger. It's a very silly, over-the-top film but unlike most films like this, it actually has a lot of quiet moments like with the father-son dynamic, a few touching scenes, and a lot of development to the characters as well.While the story may start off as cliched, it has a unique concept about an inventor who uses water to create food to help his impoverished town. I also loved his relationship with his father, even if the whole 'parent doesn't want child to follow his dreams' thing is common in films, the child here is around young adult age, the age where people should be allowed to be independent and free and the relationship with his dad shows that some adults can be restricted in what they want to do. This happened with me and my mom so I found that relatable.I also didn't mind the misunderstood inventor who keeps failing story. Yes, it's cliched but it goes along with the theme about being yourself, embracing your creativity, and keep trying even if you fail. A few things I didn't like about the story were the romance and third act. I thought Flint's repetitive attempts at kissing Sam were absurdly forced and at awkward moments that came out of nowhere since they just met each other and people aren't usually that brave enough to kiss their crush without built-up romantic tension. I love the Jello House scene though, I wish that was an actual attraction. I also didn't like the third act, I thought the whole thing about getting the kill code kind of dragged and the whole third act was very anticlimatic.The voice cast from Bill Hader to Anna Faris to Mr. T really made the characters. I thought almost all of the characters were well-rounded. There were some that we enjoyed and some that we love to hate such as the mayor and Baby Brent. Flint is such a positive guy, he's altruistic, excitable, creative, intelligent, and passionate. I liked how Sam goes from being a dumb blonde to a girl who learns to embrace her intelligence and her passion for science. Earl is funny, he's serious about his job and I like how they used a more doting relationship between him and his son to contrast Flint and Tim's more estranged relationship. Even Tim, who disapproves of our protagonist's dream, means well and just cares about his son but has trouble expressing his feelings. He finds inventing harmful to Flint and I find that sympathetic. I didn't understand how people initially liked Brent being in his underwear as an adult but even if he was a hateful character, gets some major character development by the end, becomes useful to the plot, and becomes a more likeable character.The only character that I couldn't care for was Steve, I thought he was the least developed character. He's static and added very little to the plot other than to be comic relief. He, like most monkeys is an annoying little troublemaker and I'm also against monkeys being kept as pets which is a cliche as well. He likes ripping off mustaches for some reason that they never explained and he has no backstory. I don't think he has any appeal for anyone over the age of 7 considering that I watched the movie when I was 11 and didn't like him then.I didn't care for the looney tunes style animation and the ridiculous designs on Flint and Tim. It would've looked okay on a nickelodeon tv show but not on a CGI feature film.I also wasn't a fan of the end credits scene, I thought it was really weird but just listen to Raining Sunshine, it's very catchy and really shows how happy the film is.I give this movie a 7/10. I would've gave it an 8/10 if Steve hadn't overstayed his welcome. Just make sure you eat while you watch it.",7,0,0,28 November 2019
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," If you're a Marvels fan, you will enjoy this a lot
","I saw the first GOTG at a party but didn't get to finish the whole thing. So far, it looked pretty good.I've never been a big fan of Marvels movies and this movie isn't much different. It's a superhero movie with a person that looks like iron man, action, comedy, drama, and slow moments. Though, it's probably the most emotional Marvels movie I've come across, it has more sadness in it than a Marvels movie usually has. The raccoon that looks like Star Fox, I don't recall him being this annoying in the first one, but in this one, he was annoying in the beginning of the movie, but softens up once you get to see how action- oriented he is. The tiny cute tree guy, Babby Groot was annoying in the beginning, too, but he softens up too and becomes a likable, fun character. He doesn't talk much and usually only says 'Groot', so, he has a quirk to him that makes him interesting and can be funny.Then, we got the cute Asian, Mantis who decides to join the team and I found her annoying for some reason, I don't know if it's the actress or what, but she wasn't my favorite character.I don't know if it's my autism or what, but I felt this movie was confusing and there were moments that were forced such as references to video games and the sad parts.The third act was a bit predictable and the dialogue was obvious.Verdict: The movie was heart-warming and the characters change but it's very complex and very slow. It's got some funny dialogue and fun action scenes. If you're not a fan of Marvels movies, this probably wouldn't be very entertaining for you unless you're in the mood. I was tired when I watched this movie, I got up pretty early in the morning to go get my hair done.",5,2,5,5 May 2017
The Secret Life of Pets," Talking animals, clichéd-ridden
","Welcome to the world of Secret Life of Pets, where you and other owners leave their home and your pet starts to do devious things.When I saw the trailers for this film, I thought that it was going to be a silly, crazy, corny film. But after seeing this film, I was like meh, this wasn't as bad as I thought, but still wasn't wildly entertaining.The writing was somewhat inconsistent, but the directing makes up for it, creating a funny but weird adventure. The story rehashes the Toy Story plot without much heart. There was not enough emotion and development within the characters, so it felt a bit rushed but it's not like it gets boring and I'm sure it will really entertained the kids more so than the adults or teenagers over 15.None of the characters really stood out to me, none were ultimately likable but some were still pretty fun to watch, though they were sometimes too over dramatic, even some of them to the point of me not caring much for them. Also, Snowball quickly taking a shine to Molly (the annoying little 7-year-old girl) felt a bit forced.I wasn't very interested in the character animation and the scenery in this. Yes, the city looks beautiful, but some of the background and character animation is bland. Also, I was confused if Gidget was a kitty or a dog.The only thing that stood out to me was the music. There was hip-hop and old music in this and that's what I found pretty cool about this film. But there were too many big-named casts in this film.I would give this movie a 5.9, the adventure about two set of characters was up my alley. But unfortunately, I think Illumination Entertainment is gradually getting worse like Dreamworks. The short that accompanies this film had a pretty good cameo of a dog in Secret Life of Pets but it didn't make much sense. But at this point, I am a little more worried about their upcoming film, Despicable Me 3. Especially since the second one wasn't very good.Story: 4Character: 5Animation: 7",6,1,1,27 July 2016
Finding Dory," This year isn't going so well for animated movies
","Well, last year's movies weren't so good, this year's movies have improved a bit but they still aren't anything great. Zootopia and Finding Dory both have pretty long runtime (running for about an hour and 45 minutes) which is too long for a kid-friendly comedy. And they didn't have that much drama either.The story starts off with a young Dory (at about 2 or 3) and she announces that she's suffering from short-term membory loss. Then, it shows her playing with her parents, before out of curiosity, she looks at a shell or something and then gets whisks away (in the same vein as Nemo in he first film). Since then, Dory has been asking other fishes and have been looking around for her parents.Then, she gets lost and Nemo and Marlin have to consistently reunite with her as Dory tries to remember what has happened in her early years.This is the unnecessary, pointless Pixar sequel of Finding Nemo. Kids may enjoy this but don't expect much new out of this, it's pretty much the same plot of trying to find your family relative, kind of like The Good Dinosaur but done in a slightly better and more heart-warming way.I guess it's nice to see Dory, my childhood favorite character come back but even Marlin seems to have gotten more overprotective and Dory has gotten a bit more forgetful than the first one (although, that doesn't seem to be much of a problem since the film is about Dory recovering her memories)... And the voice acting isn't the best, while newcomer Sloane Murray does alright as the voice of Young Dory, Hayden Rolance tries to sound like the original voice of Nemo but ends up coming off as high-pitched.The animation was also okay but the character design was beautiful.I would put this on the same league as Monsters University. It's like a mediocre Dreamworks film. I don't understand the appeal this and Inside Out has already, even though it did have some touching and heartfelt scenes, but the only thing it's missing is some originality.",6,2,9,23 June 2016
Wonder Woman," Am I the only one who hated this film?
","My dislike of it could be understandable since I dislike superhero movies for some reason; they just bore me. I'm not the biggest fan of action but I prefer a little action in stories.This movie starts off with Diana reminiscing about her 5-year-old self. She wants to train in fighting and even recklessly jumped off a ledge.Later, the movie time-skips to a pre-teen Diana in disbelief about what she's supposed to be doing.I dislike dramas and not that big on war films so that's three things this movie has that I don't like. The action was too fast for my brain to handle (I don't know what they put in those scenes to make it hard to keep up with) This movie had too much crying and sadness from people in it for me. Even an annoying baby crying voice. The melodrama this movie had made me cringe and get nervous and this is the first film I walked out on. I don't like wasting money on movies but mommy and a therapist told me if a movie starts to make me nervous, I can leave.This is the worst movie so far that I've seen in 2017 and that's saying a lot since Snatched could be considered the worst from the general public but I don't know Amy Schummer enough, nor do I have a disdain for her to hate it like other people do. But it was also not that good of a movie anyway so I could kind of understand why people don't like it.",3,297,548,9 June 2017
Minions," I guess a movie about yellow creatures who can hardly talk is just not worth it
","This could've been better, I guess, I was really excited about this movie because I love the Minions and Despicable Me is a fun franchise but this one just lacked a bit of heart. The minions characters' unintelligible gibberish makes the movie seem boring and just not worth it.This movie shows how the minions came to be and how they lived their lives in the 1960s. I was quite disappointed that there was no Gru until the end and even then, he was a child with a voice too old for his age and even Tina's voice doesn't fit the kid very well.The characters in there are basically annoying, even Scarlett, who was pretty likable until the film's final.The film is cute and somewhat funny, but not as funny as the Despicable Me movies and is also really boring for the most part.",4,5,10,31 October 2015
