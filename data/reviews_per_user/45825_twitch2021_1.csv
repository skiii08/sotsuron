Ali," If you're looking for entertainment look elsewhere
","This movie perhaps serves to entertain those interested in Ali as a person but for those of us wanting to watch something entertaining in a general sense, this movie was a failure. I couldn't stay focused on the movie as the story didn't seem to progress in any real captivating fashion. As someone said already...it felt more like a documentary, which is not what I was looking for. My girlfriend went to see it in theatres when it came out and actually walked out in favour of The Majestic. Even the staff at the theatre didn't appear phased by our dislike of the movie which makes me wonder if we hadn't been the only ones to do that.",1,2,5,16 September 2006
