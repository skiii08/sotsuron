Hereditary," What scares you?
","I went in to seeing this movie, not having seen the trailer or really read any of the hype. This unfolds like a family drama but with dark, dread-building undertones. I didn't find it to be too slow at all- but I do realize that people have different tolerances for pacing (especially apparent if you read other reviews). It's definitely one of those movies that you'll want to pay attention to everything to piece together what is happening. 8 stars for great performances, wonderful cinematography, genuinely scary imagery and awesomely tense moments; that being said, I do agree with other reviewers that the last 5 minutes left me feeling kinda... eh. I think whether you'll like this movie boils down to what kind of movies scare you- definitely in the realm of Rosemary's Baby, The Excorcist.",8,1,4,25 June 2018
