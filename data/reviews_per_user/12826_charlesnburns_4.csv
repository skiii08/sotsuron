National Treasure: Book of Secrets," A smart, fun adventure movie for Indiana Jones and history buffs alike
","This film and its predecessor conveyed the intangible sense of adventure and exploration which has so long been lost in a sea of mindless CGI-special effects extravaganzas. While certainly the movie has its share of special effects, it also has both a fun plot, a brain, and even a message about human nature near the end. The story-telling could be more complex, as could the villain-turned-martyr, but for an action movie, I found that it left me feeling good about the two hours I'd used to experience it. While certain liberties had to be taken with regards to historical accuracy, the movie did well to subtly separate fact from fabrication, and the viewer is left knowing some incredibly interesting things that will leave you curious to learn more. As for what those things are, and what they are not, don't let a review ruin it for you. See it for yourself. If you let yourself enjoy the film, rather than getting too hung up in whatever flaws it may have, you will find this a good experience.If you are looking for another 'Ghost Rider', thankfully, this is not what you are looking for. If you liked the first film and want a similar adventure, this is it. Note you do not have to see the first film in order to understand this one.",9,0,1,20 June 2008
Ghost Rider," The worst movie experience I have had in a long time.
","There are reviews that say, 'The plot wasn't gripping and the characters didn't bring a tear to my eye', and there are those that say, 'If that is what you are after in this kind of film, you are missing the point.'To me, the point of a movie is to be entertained. To hear a story, if not a good one--at least one well told. To have fun.There are films that are bad, but still a good time because of the feeling you have when you leave the theater. Then there are bad films which are so incompetent that they make you more cautious about how you really want to spend your time.This film was bad in every way that matters, unless special effects are your reason for living.The dialog is so jarringly terrible, a viewer almost expects every line to end with a smile--to be part of some joke before they get on with their real lines. The actors seem bored and uninspired in their roles, and Nicholas Cage seems wooden even for... Well, even for Nicholas Cage.If it weren't for movies like National Treasure, I would have sworn to never see another Cage film again. I do not know how any actor's agent let them have a part in this movie without a letter of resignation, but this happens sometimes. Look up 'Gigli' and '88 Minutes' for other examples.Please do not pay money for this movie. Viewing it is like pushing rusty carpenter nails into your abdomen. It is so bad that it is a running joke among everyone I know. When a bad movie is released, we say, 'Well, it isn't Ghost rider, but it was still crap.' Avoid this movie. For the children.",1,2,5,20 June 2008
The Lion King," Disney's best animated film
","While Lion King was shamelessly ripped off from Osamu Tezuka's 'Kimba the White Lion', it is in my opinion the best animated film that Disney has ever released. It was well-paced, had excellent character development with a good mix of characters, a great plot, a believable and charming villain, and an absolutely stunning original score.Unlike many of Disney's later animated films such as Atlantis, the Lion King's plot progress did not feel rushed (nor is it slow), and does not suffer from the bizarre and difficult to describe 'caricature personality' that appears to be growing in popularity with many recent animated films and children's cartoon series.The extended version mostly includes material which Disney was wise to omit from the original release. These new additions, for example, 'Morning Report', were largely uninspired and I feel they actually detract from the movie. I would recommend that new viewers first see the original, 'unextended' edition first, and draw their own conclusions.While some disliked the movie for its use of all non-human characters, or for the use of 'inter-family felicide', I would rate this a 10/10 and call it one of the 3 or 4 Disney films which truly deserve their over-used moniker of 'masterpiece.'",10,0,0,26 February 2006
V for Vendetta," 'I promise you it will be like nothing you have ever seen.'
","The purpose of a movie review is really to offer advice on whether the reader should use 2 hours of their time to experience it. The answer is yes.The Wachowski Brothers were behind 'The Matrix.' After that, until this movie, I thought that the brothers were a one-hit-wonder.V for Vendetta is unconventional. If you are one that can appreciate subtlety, depth, and a powerful story driven by well-written, intelligently created characters, this is an amazing work.I do not know if it remains faithful to the original comic, as I have never read a comic in my life, but this is as close to a reason to begin as I've ever seen.",9,2,8,26 June 2008
