Lucky Number Slevin," Loved It!!
","Absolutely Loved this movie..What an intriguing film. I must say after a year of remakes this was just the most enjoyable movie I've seen this year. I was watching all these terrible things happen to this man but so very caught up in what happens next to even notice how much violence was in this movie. Not to mention Lucy Lius character(Lindsey)bringing so much energy and such a corky awareness of the situation. Lets not forget Josh Hartnett(slevin),Loved the way his mouth ran! He does it in this innocent way. Very upbeat Character,very up beat movie. Like I said I absolutely LOVED this movie and this CAST...So thanks guys I'm definitely recommending it to everyone I know.",8,0,2,14 November 2006
