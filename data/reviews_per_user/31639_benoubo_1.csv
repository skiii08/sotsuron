Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Not as good as Kill bill vol. 1
","I've been expected kill bill vol. 2 since I watched vol. 1. But to my surprise, the two volumes are in totally different style, though by the same director/writer. Vol. 1 concentrate on the action/brutal photography, which might bring you some inside feeling you could never articulate but at least you can you are shocked when you finished vol. 1. Vol. 2, tells us a story, comedy/philosophy/drama type. I like vol. 1 more than vol. 2, coz I appreciated the director style of vol. 1, thinking it differentiate the director from other thriller/action directors. But the vol. 2, I guess, maybe consider too much about the common psychology and needs. It can make you laugh and chuckle all through the whole movie, it has much dialogue, but it neglects the expectation most audience would have been waiting for since vol. 1. So I give vol. 2 a 8 out of 10.Anyway, if you watch the vol. 1 & 2 together, it would be a masterpiece.",8,0,1,25 April 2004
