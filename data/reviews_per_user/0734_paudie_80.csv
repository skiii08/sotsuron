The King's Speech," Well crafted historical drama
","'The King's Speech' is a very well made and acted historical drama. It is based on the true story of the Duke of York, younger brother of the heir to the British throne. His terrible stammer makes public appearances unbearable for him. Various treatments prove unsuccessful. As a last resort his wife, the future Queen Mother, brings him to Lionel Logue, an Australian speech therapist with unusual methods.In the background we see the situation within 'the firm' changing. The Prince of Wales becomes King but remains determined to marry an unsuitable American divorc√©e. This may result in his abdication and the Duke of York becoming King. The pressure is on both the Duke and Logue to improve the Duke's speech so that he can speak properly to his subjects.The relationship between the two men is shown to have been very close. Logue is determined to treat the Duke as just another patient, insisting on calling him by his first name and refusing to go to the Palace for sessions. He encourages to Duke to reveal unhappy memories from his childhood. At one stage the future King and Queen arrive at Logue's house for an informal 'chat'. This informality strikes me as unlikely for those times.However the fact that we know where the movie is taking a few liberties with the truth doesn't take away from our enjoyment of it. The acting is spot on. Firth and Rush are excellent. However I particularly enjoyed Helena Bonham Carter as the Duchess of York. While the Duke doesn't seem to mind being treated as a 'commoner' by Logue she is always at pains to be addressed in the correct way. There is a hint of steel beneath the velvet glove that probably isn't too far removed from the real Duchess' character.The locations and costumes transport us perfectly back to pre-war Britain. In particular director Tom Hooper brilliantly raises the tension as we move towards the climactic set piece as the now King delivers a radio address to the nation following the outbreak of World War II. We are rooting for him to prove that he can lead the nation at such a dark time.",8,3,6,27 January 2011
Moneyball," Excellent movie about baseball and business
","Moneyball is as much about business as baseball. It tells the story of Billy Beane, the general manager of the Major League Oakland A's. It is the early 2000's and the team have had a great season, getting to the playoffs and losing to the star studded New York Yankees. He would like to build on that success but the owner tells him he can't increase the team budget and three of his best players will be moving to bigger teams where they will get much bigger salaries.The owner is fair and doesn't expect Beane to perform miracles. He knows his GM will try his best to unearth diamonds through his scouting team. Beane himself is very unhappy. He knows that, no matter how well he scouts and how hard he bargains; the sport is weighted in favour of the big clubs with the most money and in the long run, the odd good season apart, the A's will always be one of the runts of the MLB litter.It is with this mindset that he holds the first meeting of the offseason with his scouting team. Like every other year the scouts (who are portrayed as much older than Beane, played by Brad Pitt) will try to find cheap talented players, using the tried old methods they have always used. Beane is not happy with this and tells the scouts that the old ways ware no longer good enough, as the A's can't compete with the richer teams without trying something different. He doesn't even know what this 'new way' is but he knows he must try something.By chance Beane meets Peter Brand, a young man who seems to have a lot of influence in the Cleveland Indians players selection. Beane is curious and Brand reveals that he uses a statistical method of grading players that, basically, grades players on how many runs they get, not on their style of play or their reputation. Brand is convinced that most baseball times don't look for what is really important when they are scouting for players. Beane thinks that this could be the angle he needs and hires Brand as his assistant, much to the chagrin of some of the scouting staff.Beane and Brand bring in some new players that no other team seems to want. The season starts poorly and the manager doesn't want to pick some of the new players. However they stick with the new system and it starts to pay off as the team go on a record breaking unbeaten run and end the season in the playoffs.I really enjoyed the movie. It seems to be a real underdog story but in the end baseball is shown to be a business first and last. The ending reveals the megarich Boston Red Sox won the World Series a few years later, using the system that Beane used in 2002 with the A's. It seems the richer teams just copied the new scouting system that worked and still throw a lot of money at players. So, again the smaller teams can't really compete! The acting is good. Jonah Hill is excellent in a rare non-comedy role. I thought Pitt was trying a bit too hard. Perhaps he had Oscar night in mind.There are some great scenes, especially at the start of the movie when Beane confronts his old scouts and when he visits a player he wants to sign, knowing the player has received no other offers due to injury problems. There are a few 'Hollywood' moments that jarred a bit, such as the match they broke the consecutive wins record (too much slow motion) and a few scenes with Beane's daughter (too much singing).There isn't much actual baseball shown, so don't be put off from seeing this if you aren't a fan. This movie, like most good movies is about people and how they react to changing circumstances in their lives.",8,1,2,10 February 2012
Black Swan," A front row seat for a descent into madness
","Darren Aronofsky uses the story of an emotionally fragile ballerina who is chosen to play the lead in 'Swan Lake' to take us on a gut-wrenching journey through a mind losing touch with reality.Natalie Portman plays Nina, a talented but shy ballerina. She lives at home with her slightly creepy mother (Barbara Hershey), who treats her like a child. The ballet director chooses Nina to play the lead in the 'Swan Lake'. He says she is perfect for the virginal 'White Swan' character but pushes her to convince him that she can play the wicked 'Black Swan', a part always played by the same ballerina. We see Nina struggling with her inner demons as she is forced to confront the sensual elements of her characters. she is playing and herself. It is clear that she is uncomfortable with her own sexuality.As the film goes on the images become more intense and shocking, until the final act, which leaves the viewers head spinning. No surprise there, given Aronofsky's previous movies then! Along the way he teases us with plenty of hints as to possible reasons for Nina's emotional immaturity.Overall I was slightly disappointed in the film. I felt that the director's main aim was to shock us and the narrative suffered slightly as a result. However Natalie Portman is outstanding as the fragile Nina. She is on screen practically all the time (sometimes more than once at the same time!) and brilliantly conveys the conflict between Nina's desire to be the best ballerina possible and the baggage of her upbringing",8,0,2,14 February 2011
Changeling," Doesn't quite hit the spot
","This film is good but it doesn't quite hit the spot. I suppose expectations for any Eastwood film are high given his track record but I thought he would have done better with this story based on amazing true life events.I'm not sure why I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would. The story of the child going missing and a different boy being presented to the mother by LAPD seems made for a movie, even without the even more horrific subplot of what actually happened to the boy.Jolie is good as the mother but,not her fault I know, you never forget who she is, with those amazing eyes and lips in nearly every scene. At times, especially given the main theme and some very disturbing scenes, the film strays uncomfortably into sentimentality. Such as when Jolie gets all the women illegally held in the asylum released and her 'best friend inside' gives her a grateful glance as she leaves.Definitely worth seeing but not one of the films of the year.",7,5,10,10 December 2008
Skyfall," Bravo Javier!
","I am not really a Bond fan but I decided to go this one as I hadn't seen Daniel Craig in the role and the reviews had been good. I enjoyed the film a lot but there is no doubt the highlight was the performance of Javier Bardem as the villain, Silva. He marks his first appearance in the movie with a memorable speech about rats and after that he steals every scene that he is in.Judi Dench as M has quite a big part as she and Silva have a history. Craig as Bond didn't really convince me.His acting seems one-dimensional and po-faced. Let's face it. The whole idea of the indestructible, unaging secret agent is slightly ridiculous so it should, up to a point, be played with a slight wink to the audience. Maybe I'm being patriotic Irishman but I think Pierce Brosnan did a better job of it than Craig.'Skyfall' is good Bond movie, not as groundbreaking as some reviews make it out to be. Bond fans will love its spectacular locations and dramatic action scenes. Others like myself will be giving thanks for Javier!",7,1,7,26 November 2012
The Hangover," Or How the lads got away with it
","If belly laughs are what you are after there are plenty of them in this film. The plot is simple. Four lads go to Vegas for a stag night. The following morning their room is a mess and the groom is missing. And they have no memory of the night before. They have to retrace their steps to find the groom before the wedding the following day. That sounds like a routine 'Gross Out' comedy, which in many ways it is. Most of the characters are straight out of clich√©s, the hen pecked nerd, the married guy who wants to cut loose for once and the groom who wants to have a good time but not overdo things so soon before the wedding. There are some very funny scenes and unexpected plot twists to keep your attention.Undoubtedly for me the highlight of the performance of Zach Galifianakis as the brother-in-law to be. He is subtle and very funny as the unclich√©d and downright weird Alan. He also gets the best conversation stopping one-liners.I'd recommend this to a mainly male audience. The female characters aren't developed at all and are there only to move the plot along. An alternative title might be 'How the lads got away with acting the eejit in Vegas'. A shocking waste of the lovely Heather Graham unfortunately. So it's not Shakespeare but I laughed a lot.",7,6,12,21 July 2009
Star Trek," Once more. From the beginning
","I had read the decent reviews and decided to take a chance and see this movie, despite not being a Star Trek fan. I thoroughly enjoyed it. It is a case of leaving your brain at the foyer and just going with the flow. The idea of going back to the origins of the how the Enterprise crew came together is an excellent one as it gives us, essentially, new characters. Frankly the Shatner Enterprise crew and the Next Generation troops were past their sell by date, although Leonard Nimoy has a reasonably big role as 'Old Spock' in a nod to the older fans. The effects are excellent, the action never stops and there are some good one-liners. What more could you want? Don't give yourself a headache by trying to make sense of the plot, involving time travel among other things. Just strap yourself in and get ready for another successful franchise to blast off!",7,1,6,18 June 2009
Memento," Intriguing
","Some films have an intriguing premise but don't deliver on it. Christopher Nolan's Memento delivers in spades!The story of a man searching for his wife's killer but unable to retain any short term memories is obviously intriguing. Nolan adds twists by telling the story in reverse and having our 'hero' aid his memory with tattoos and instant photos.By the end of the film the viewer's head is spinning and we don't know what to make of the previous 90 minutes. Thank God for rewind buttons on DVD remotes!The film is about memory. Nolan brilliantly plays with the viewer's own memory. At first we feel sympathy for Leonard, trying to piece together enough information from his disabled memory to get revenge on his wife's murderer. At the conclusion we realise that in the course of the film we may have played tricks on our own memories. Were the assumptions we made in following the story completely wrong? Were our sympathies misplaced?A lot of the film hangs on the performance of Guy Pearce in the main character and he is brilliant. Carrie Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano are also excellent in the main supporting roles. Quite simply, one of the best films of the last ten years. You have to watch it!",9,0,2,26 August 2008
Inglourious Basterds," A bit self indulgent, violent but very funny
","I thoroughly enjoyed this film but I don't think it ranks with Tarantino's classics like Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. The film is based around three long scenes and you could say the rest of the plot is only there to facilitate Tarantino to get to those scenes that he has obviously spent a long time in writing.The cast is very good. Chrisoph Waltz is brilliant as the SS officer without any scruples. Expect him to get an Oscar nomination. However I found Brad Pitt a bit annoying with his Southern accent and Popeye chin. The film is two and three quarter hours long but thankfully doesn't drag too much. The plot is mainly about two separate plans to kill many of the Nazi leadership in a Paris cinema. One is to be carried out by the 'Inglourious Basterds' of the title ‚Äì a group of American Jewish soldiers sent behind enemy lines in France 'to kill Nazis'. The second is organised by the cinema owner, who has very personal reasons to hate the Germans. We are introduced to her in the first of the long scenes that Tarantino directs and writes brilliantly. He ratchets up the tension minute by minute as Colonel Landa interrogates the French farmer hiding the Jewish family.The second of the long scenes sees some of the 'Basterds' meet their German contact in a cellar bar, surrounded by German soldiers celebrating the birth of a baby. Again the tension rises slowly as the scene heads to an inevitable bloody conclusion. The final main scene in the Paris cinema as the German leadership and all the surviving characters gather is also excellent, though it veers towards high farce at the end.If you like Tarantino films you will like 'Inglourious Basterds' also. As with his other films it is very violent. There is also a lot of laugh out loud humour, often in the most violent scenes. You will have to go with the flow as Tarantino the director indulges Tarantino the writer but you will almost definitely leave the cinema smiling.",8,1,9,6 October 2009
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Not Bad. Not Brilliant
","Want to see a film with some gratuitous (male) full frontal nudity? Then this is the one for you so.Overall this is pretty lightweight stuff but it does have a few good lines and scenes.The story is pretty simple. Guy is heartbroken after longterm girlfriend dumps him for rockstar. He goes on holiday and ends up in the same resort as the girlfriend. Hilarious high jinks ensue as he decides between heartbreaker and gorgeous cool receptionist at the hotel who happens to take a shine to him.Good performances from all the leads, even Russell Brand. Bell and Kunis are indeed easy on the eye.A good few laughs but it lags a bit towards the end.",6,1,4,6 February 2009
The Hunger Games," Mostly delivers on an intriguing premise
","I was curious to see 'The Hunger Games' because of the intriguing premise and a good trailer. I haven't read the book so I can't comment on any similarities and/or differences between the two versions.The story is set in the future where country is divided into 12 Districts and ruled from the 'Capitol'. Around 80 years before the Districts rose up against the rulers but were defeated after a bloody conflict. As punishment and a reminder the ruling classes started the annual 'Hunger Games' where one male and one female under 18 from each district are selected by lot and brought to the Capitol to compete in a televised survival competition which continues until only one contestant survives.The film focuses mostly on the female contestant from District 12, Katniss Everdeen. Unusually she has volunteered to compete, after her much younger sister was chosen in the lottery. She is reasonably well equipped for the contest as she is the main breadwinner for her sister and widowed mother and is skilled at hunting for food.When they get to the Capitol the contestants find that they are huge celebrities. The contrast between futuristic Capitol and the poverty we saw in District 12 is stark. Each pair of contestants is allocated a mentor to instruct them on how to prepare. The District 12 pair is lucky enough to get Woody Harrelson, (with shoulder length blond hair!). He is a former winner who is now living the good life. Initially he doesn't show much interest in the prospects for the young pair but soon he realises that Katniss, in particular, has the skills to have a good chance of survival and tells her this.Once the survival 'show' starts Katniss puts her survival skills to good use but the show producers are determined to give their viewers a good show and can manipulate conditions when they want to. The action sequences in this part of the movie are very good.I wasn't entirely convinced by the acting of Jennifer Lawrence in the main role. I thought her facial expression was almost blank a lot of the time. Woody Harrelson and Elizabeth Banks were good in the supporting roles. Donald Sutherland is suitably malevolent as the Capitol President, who recognises the spirited Katniss as a potential troublemaker.Overall I enjoyed the movie. Even though it is over two and a half hours long it didn't drag as there three distinct parts to the movie ‚Äì Introduction and the lottery ‚Äì Preparation in the Capitol ‚Äì 'The Show'. As I write this review I can think of a few weaknesses in the plot that I didn't notice as I watched the movie but maybe that is a good sign of an action movie. On the downside I thought the last half hour of the movie was disappointing as it involved a dose of teen romance and a 'neat and tidy' ending. There are also sure signs that there will be other movies in this series.",7,0,3,9 May 2012
Shaun of the Dead," Good British comedy
","I'd been meaning to watch this film for a while and was slightly disappointed in it but it is quite funny.The idea of a comedy zombie film set in suburban england is a good one and there are some very funny scenes. The film is based around typical British institutions such as the local pub, male bonding, the deferential British mammy and this leads to some good lines. Familiar faces such as Penelope Wilton and Bill Nighy appear along with newer faces such as Simon Pegg. I thought Hot Fuzz was funnier though.",7,0,2,6 February 2009
Argo," Excellent political thriller
","Ben Affleck is developing a decent track record for himself as a director. Gone Baby Gone, The Town and now Argo are all very entertaining. More than just pretty face then! Argo is based on the true story of six American Embassy employees who escaped when the Embassy in Tehran was attacked in 1979 by protesters against the US giving the Shah sanctuary following his fall from power. They find refuge in the home of the Canadian ambassador and the US authorities have to find a way to get them out of Iran before the local authorities realise they are there.Be warned though, from comments on the movie it seems clear the movie is a highly dramatized and not very accurate portrayal of what happened.Affleck plays Tony Mendez, a CIA agent specialising in these operations. He has contacts in Hollywood and comes up with the idea of setting up a fake movie to arrange a trip to Tehran to scout locations and bringing the escapees home on the way back as part of the crew.The movie is good in showing us the tension felt by the escapees in Tehran and by Mendez in the US as he tries to make his scheme workable.The tension builds as Mendez goes to Tehran and tells the plan to the trapped Americans. Some of them are understandably sceptical. However they have little choice but to go along with it and the final Tehran airport sequence is well done, though perhaps more than a little far fetched.In fairness to the makers at the start of the movie some time is given to explain the historical background to the unpopularity of the US in post revolution Iran.Definitely a political thriller I'd recommend, though maybe not for factual accuracy.",7,0,0,2 January 2013
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Funny, Smart, Movie
","This is an above average romantic comedy with an excellent cast and a few unexpected plot twists.Steve Carrell is shocked when his wife of 25 years (Julianne Moore) tells him she wants a divorce after she has a one-night stand with a work colleague After moving out of home he starts to drown his sorrows in local pick up joints. He is spotted by a younger self-confessed Lothario played by Ryan Gosling. He uses his good looks and charm to bed almost all the women he sets his eye on. He decides to take Carrell under his wing to advise him how to make the most of his newly single status. However we do see Gosling failing with one lady, played by Emma Stone.There are some laughs as Carrel's character is transformed and starts getting a bit of luck with the ladies, first off with a teacher, played by Marisa Tomei. We also see how he tries to maintain a good relationship with his kids. There are a number of story lines that you know will probably all come together at some stage of the movie.The cast members are all excellent. Stone and Carrell have done comedies before and are excellent again here. Moore, Gosling, Tomei and Kevin Bacon also put in excellent performances. Jonah Bobo is also excellent as Carrell's teenage son.The writing is excellent, makings us feel sympathy for the main characters, despite their faults.So despite a closing scene at a school graduation that is dragged out too long I really enjoyed this movie.",7,0,1,13 October 2011
Ted," Not just for Family Guy fans but the apple hasn't fallen far from the tree
","Seth McFarlane has a great idea for a story about a little boy who wishes that his teddy bear might come to life. This happens and all is well with the world.But what happens when the boy grows up and his teddy still wants to be his best friend? It turns out that 'Ted' and John (Mark Wahlberg) are still living together along with John's girlfriend Lori (Mila Kunis) and they like nothing better than drinking and getting high.Lori keeps reminding him that he has to get away from Ted and start acting like a grown up. It takes most of the movie for this to sink in with John but there are some funny scenes in the meantime.It stretches disbelief more than a little that Wahlberg's underachieving character could be going out with a Mila Kunis lookalike for four years but he is a talented comic actor so he just about gets away with it.There some funny scenes as the obnoxious Ted struggles to start a life on his own. McFarlane also throws in a lot of trademark 'edgy' one-liners, mostly spoken by Ted.However the movie does drag a lot and an unnecessary 'Ted gets kidnapped' plot line makes this even worse.Perhaps best saved for a DVD rental.",6,0,1,17 August 2012
Superbad," A step up from 'Pie'
","Comparisons with American Pie are inevitable but in my opinion Superbad is the better of the two films. That's not to say that it isn't full of male teenage obsessions, bad language and sexual references. It certainly is. However in my opinion the film's intentions are in the right place while the American Pie series went for the 'gross out' option a bit too often.The plot is familiar. Nerdy teenagers are worried about their lack of sexual experience as the end of high school approaches. An unexpected opportunity presents itself as they are invited to a 'cool girls' party. The catch is they have offered to supply the alcohol for the party. They believe obtaining the booze will almost certainly result in them reaching the 'Holy Grail'. Their attempts to get alcohol lead them into more and more outlandish situations as the evening progresses.Perhaps what sets this film apart is the genuine attempt to deal with the teenage male relationships. The two main protagonists have been best friends forever. However one of them will be going to an Ivy League college, the other won't. The underlying tension both of them feel is dealt with well in the film.One negative point for me was that I thought the incompetent cops (Seth Rogen and Bill Hader) had too big a role in the film. They are funny in the robbery scene but after that they almost become the main characters and I felt this just dragged out the film.The performances are excellent. Michael Cera and Jonah Hill strike the right note as the best friends. Christopher Mintz-Plasse is very good as the kid so nerdy even the nerds are embarrassed to be seen with him.Some of the humour is very broad and aimed at a mostly male audience but the film would be enjoyed by most people.",7,0,3,11 November 2008
500 Days of Summer," Excellent RomCom from the Male Point of View
","I really enjoyed this film. It is funny, touching, well written and very well acted. It thankfully avoids most of the romcom clich√©s that we are so familiar.The film tells of the 500 days from the first time Tom meets (and instantly falls for) Summer. In this case Tom is the hopeless romantic and Summer goes with the flow but doesn't believe in love. There is a twist by not showing the events in chronological order. So at the start of each scene we see which day of the 500 it is and therefore have a good idea of the stage the relationship is at. So we go back and forth between the good times of the early days to Tom's problems in dealing with the break up and Summer moving on.Zooey Deschanel and Joseph Gordon Levitt play the lead characters perfectly. You like them despite their faults and hope things work out well. However it becomes obvious that their relationship is not meant to be but hope they don't get too badly hurt. The supporting cast is always important in comedies and they are also great, especially Geoffrey Arend as one of Tom's workmates.A romcom that both men and women will enjoy. And hopefully some women will realise that some of us men are romantic too!",8,0,2,6 October 2009
Juno," Fast Talking But Heart Warming
","I enjoyed this film a lot. The story is relatively simple. A schoolgirl gets pregnant and decides to put the baby up for adoption. She happens to be a wisecracking smart ass, perhaps enough to be really annoying. In fact she seems such a know it all you wonder how she got herself into this trouble at all! However the film makes it clear however that Juno, despite trying to be uber mature, is still just a young girl. Have no doubt, this is a 'feelgood' film. Nearly all the characters are basically decent people and the plot is tied up perhaps too neatly. The development of Juno's relationship with her step mother would nearly bring a tear to your eye alone. The different story lines in the film are combined well together by the director, such as Juno's relationships with the prospective adoptive parents and with the father of the baby. Great performances all round really make the film. Page, Cera, Garner,Bateman, Janney and Simmons are all excellent. For a few laughs and maybe a few tears watch this film.",8,1,4,5 November 2008
Midnight in Paris," Return to form for Woody? I enjoyed it anyway
","Many of the reviews of 'Midnight in Paris' describe it as return to form for Woody Allen. We've all heard that many times before but I was still persuaded to see it as I hadn't seen one of his movies in years.I did enjoy the movie though it hardly a classic. It begins with a title sequence featuring views of Paris, often in the rain, that reminded me of the beginning of 'Manhattan'.The movie is about an American screenwriter, played by Owen Wilson, who is in Paris with his fianc√©e, played by Rachel McAdams. He is trying to write a novel, feeling he is wasting his time making easy money from writing movie scripts. He is a sentimental soul. He loves Paris but imagines it would have been ideal to live there in the 1920's with the likes of Picasso and Hemingway. His fianc√©e is only there for the pre-wedding shopping with her mother and thinks he should be delighted to have such a lucrative career.His wish comes true when, as he walks back to the hotel alone one night, he is magically transported back to 1920's Paris and finds himself socialising with his artistic heroes. He meets and falls for a French model played by Marion Cotillard and starts to return every night to see her and get advice on his novel from the likes of Gertrude Stein. Allen populates the movie with as many famous artists of the period as possible ‚Äì Dali, Bunuel, Man Ray.He is convinced that he doesn't want to return to his old life, only to find that his new love hates the 1920's and imagines that life must have been so much better in Paris during 'La Belle Epoque' when Gaugin and Lautrec were around.This leads to a conclusion where the moral is pretty clear ‚Äì Even if times were better in times past (and maybe they weren't) you still have to make the most of the times you are living in.Owen Wilson is well cast as the confused writer. The beatnik persona he has in most of movies his perfect here. McAdams is wasted a bit in the one-dimensional character of his rather unpleasant fianc√©e. Cotillard is lovely and superb as the world-weary model. As usual with Allen's movies there are plenty of cameos. Adrien Brody's over the top Dali is especially memorable.I'm sure I missed most of the literary and artistic references in the movie but this didn't stop me from enjoying this well written and beautifully filmed movie.",7,8,11,1 November 2011
Milk," Film about a great human rights advocate
","As a European I had never heard of Harvey Milk until I read about this film. Following all the excellent reviews I decided to see it and I wasn't disappointed. The film is about the struggle for human rights and the major part one man played in it in 70's America. We meet Harvey in New York as he makes the decision to go the San Francisco to do something with his life as he reaches 40. There he sees the discrimination against the gay community by the City authorities and the police. He decides the best way to fight this is by gaining elected office. He is charismatic and intelligent and gathers an enthusiastic and capable team around him. After a few defeats he is elected to the SF Board of Supervisors as the first openly gay man to be elected to a major public office in the US. Once in office he is true to his word and campaigns for the people who elected him, in particular against Proposition 6, which wanted to prevent gay teachers from working in schools. The film shows one great speech where he reminds people of the rights enshrined in the US Constiution and written on the Statue of Liberty and says that he is fighting for those rights to be protected. He is also shown to be a tough politician, always considering the best way to get his policies adopted, with all the associated horse-trading if necessary. Harvey's life was to end in tragedy at the hands of a former supervisor. I really enjoyed this film. It captured the atmosphere of 70's San Francisco really well, getting across the excitement of the time. It also shows us Milk's private life and how it affected his public life and vice versa.The performances are all excellent, especially from Sean Penn.",8,1,4,25 February 2009
Once," Modern Musical
","After watching 'Once' I read a few reviews that described it as a modern musical and that is a perfect description. I'm not a fan of the 'traditional' musical where the guys and gals break into song and dance at every opportunity. The music may be great but the placing of the songs in the story always grates a little.This film is full of songs (but no dancing) and it feels perfectly natural. The two main characters meet through music and are attracted to each other partly because of their big part music plays in both their lives. The songs are in the film as part of their story and don't feel shoehorned in.The film is only 80 minutes long and the story is simple. A Dublin busker and a Czech immigrant strike up a friendship. There is a mutual attraction but their individual circumstances mean that we know they will not end up together, however much we want that to happen. Glenn Hansard and Marketa Irglova are excellent as the couple. Each of their stories is sad in its own way but not without hope. I won't give much detail as part of the beauty of the film is how their relationship develops as they learn more about each other.From a musical point of view the Oscar winning song 'Falling Slowly' is a classic in the making. I couldn't get it out my head for days afterwards. However some of the other Glenn Hansard songs are a bit too intense and earnest for me. Anyone familiar with the albums of Hansard's band The Frames will know what I'm talking about. Irglova's songs are easier on the ear and more romantic.Even a cynic by myself couldn't help be touched by this bittersweet story that is always grounded in the real world.A beautiful that I would recommend to anyone.",9,3,5,12 October 2009
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Great thriller but were the 70's this grim?
","Firstly I don't remember the BBC TV series of the John Le Carr√© novel so I won't compare this movie to it.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie even though it portrays the rather seedy goings on behind the Cold War.George Smiley had been a senior figure in British Intelligence but he was forced to retire along with his boss when an agent is killed on an unauthorised assignment in Hungary. However rumours of a Soviet mole at the top echelons of Intelligence (known as the circus) have persisted and the Minister in charge decides to find out whether they are true once and for all. Smiley is chosen to do this as he knows the spy business and all the suspects very well but is no longer working with them.The plot is quite complex so I won't describe it in detail. Smiley has his suspicions and slowly but surely he gathers all the information he can to get to the bottom of the mystery. He is the ultimate 'low key' spy, gleaning information from subtly interviewing people. Gary Oldman is excellent as the world-weary but still determined Smiley.For me one of the best things about the movie is that it shows that despite the Cold War being apparently between two rival political philosophies the individuals involved are motivated by such basic emotions as lust, jealousy, greed and ambition. This applies even to Smiley himself.While Smiley is the main character the supporting cast including Colin Firth, Benedict Cumberbatch and Toby Jones are outstanding. Swedish director Tomas Alfredson does a great job in bringing to life the grey paranoid world of the Cold War. He distills the novel into a slow moving but very satisfying movie.",8,0,2,3 November 2011
Snatch," Too much Lock Stock
","I enjoyed Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels a lot. It was original, funny and stylishly made. Snatch is funny and stylishly made but reminded me too much of Lock Stock. It has the Guy Ritchie trademarks of colourful character names, convoluted plots, slow motion sequences and hectic editing¬Ö..and Vinnie Jones but I felt he was trying to much to copy the successful formula of Lock Stock.Ritchie obviously used the success of his previous film to attract big name stars to the cast, notably Brad Pitt and Benicio Del Toro. Pitt is excellent as the fighting traveller who can't be beaten. Jason Statham returns as the 'hero' and narrator. The plot deals with what happens how the worlds of illegal boxing and 'Pikies' (travellers) meet. Many familiar faces show up playing the inhabitants of London's underworld.Perhaps you would enjoy this film more if you have never seen Lock Stock. I'd definitely prefer the older film.",7,0,1,3 February 2010
The Way Back," Decent rather than outstanding drama
","It's a mark of the quality of Peter Weir's work to date that you expect something special when you are going to see one of his movies. Perhaps this is the reason I felt slightly disappointed with 'The Way Back'.It is a good movie that tells a inspiring story based on actual events. During World War II a group of men escape from a Siberian camp for political prisoners and trek on foot for thousands of miles to freedom. This story is told perfectly well by Weir. There is great cinematography in a varied series of landscapes and some harrowing scenes both before and after the escape. However the movie didn't stay with me for any time after seeing it.There is a high quality cast, featuring Ed Harris, Colin Farrell and Saoirse Ronan.I'd describe 'The Way Back' as a well-made drama that is worth seeing on DVD rather than arranging babysitters etc for a trip to the cinema.",7,3,7,11 January 2011
Knocked Up," Funny but thoughtful as well
","I had been meaning to watch 'Knocked Up' for a while so I was somewhat disappointed that it wasn't as good as I expected it to be. I thought that 'The 40 year old Virgin', made by the same Judd Apatow team, was hilarious in parts. They are plenty of funny moments in 'Knocked Up' but not as many laugh out loud moments as the script takes an at-times reflective look at modern relationships. The story is simple. Overweight slacker Ben (Seth Rogen) meets stunning career girl Alison (Katherine Heigl) in a club when both are on drunken nights out. They have sex but she decides in the morning that one night was plenty. When she later discovers she's pregnant she decides to keep the baby and contacts him to tell him the news. They decide to try to make their relationship succeed for the sake of the baby. The film has a lot of thoughtful moments, as the new couple work out whether the relationship has a chance. However there are plenty of moments of gross out humour to lighten the mood, mostly involving Ben's dissolute housemates. There is a secondary storyline involving Alison's sister. She is having marriage trouble and this gives the younger couple food for thought as they decide on what they want to do. Leslie Mann and Paul Rudd are good as the wife and husband. The supporting performances are also good with plenty of familiar faces such as Jonah Hill, Jason Siegl and Jay Baruchel",7,0,0,31 August 2010
The Town," If you loved 'Heat' you'll like this
","Along with the 'Hooker with the Heart of Gold' the 'Criminal who wants to turn his Life Around' is one of the most popular of clich√©d characters in movies. In fairness 'The Town' is a good example of this genre. Ben Affleck's directorial debut 'Gone Baby Gone' was a surprisingly bleak. This film is a considerably lighter in tone, even if it does deal with a gang of bank robbers.Affleck's plays the head of the gang, Doug McRay. They rob a bank but the manager (Rebecca Hall) lives near the gang in Charlestown, the Boston district that gives the film its title. The FBI, led by Jon Hamm, start to investigate the robbery. The gang decide to keep an eye on the manager to find out if she can identify them. She and McRay fall into conversation almost immediately and start going out. A bit unlikely , I know. As they get to know each other we learn the McRay's back-story. He is a good bank robber but is unhappy that he is to going down the path that led his father to be in jail for murder.He wants to call it a day but his second-in-command and best friend (Jeremy Renner) is a loose cannon and is getting a kick from the lifestyle after being in jail for 9 years. He wants to continue robbing but is determined not to go to jail again. A huge robbery at the Boston Red Sox stadium (Fenway Park) is set up even though the FBI investigation is getting closer to the gang. This leads to a dramatic set piece to climax the film.The plot isn't very original but the acting is excellent and the chase and robbery scenes are very well done. If you loved Michael Mann's 'Heat' you will like this film.",7,0,3,28 October 2010
Shutter Island," Go with the flow and enjoy it!
","I don't think I'm giving much away by saying that it shouldn't take you long to come to the conclusion that everything isn't quite as it seems.Based on the novel by Dennis Lehane, who has had a few of his novels filmed in the last few years (Gone Baby Gone and Mystic River) the film opens as US Marshalls Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo travel to the institution for the criminally insane on Shutter Island. A female inmate who murdered her children but refuses to accept it has disappeared from a locked cell. They meet the doctors and some of the prisoners. Soon however DiCaprio's character starts having strange dreams and flashbacks to his time as a soldier when he was present at the liberation of Dachau.To tell any more might spoil the ending. It's obvious that renowned film buff Scorsese had fun making this film. There are nods to a few genres ‚Äì supernatural thrillers, whodunits, prison/asylum stories.The film has an old fashioned feel to it. From the 1950's costumes to the institution with it's dungeon-like cells for the most disturbed inmates Scorsese nicely brings the story to the boil leading up to the climax.The performances are good, although DiCaprio's constant intense frown does tend to get on my nerves. Ben Kingsley and Max Von Sydow (great to see him) are excellent as the head doctors. Mark Ruffalo is good as DiCaprio's sidekick.I liked the film a lot. My advice would be not to think about the plot too much but go with the flow and enjoy one of the all time great filmmakers showing off his talents in a new genre.",7,1,3,30 March 2010
Tangled," Excellent animation- Decent story- You'll enjoy it
","I enjoyed this movie a lot. It's an 'old-fashioned' Disney animated movie, based on a traditional fairy tale. However the characters are given a more modern twist. Rapunzel is a young woman who, despite being locked in a tower for 18 years, is self-confident enough to persuade a passing thief to help her see the world.The animation is excellent with plenty of bright colours. There is plenty of humour in the script, though not too many laugh out loud lines. The plot is pretty light, though there are a few dark moments in the closing 30 minutes (I wasn't scared¬Ö.I swear!). There are also the usual Alan Menken penned songs. I'm not a great fan of putting songs in these movies, as it tends to slow down the plot but Disney sticks with their well-tried formula.The movie is probably aimed mostly at pre-teen girls but accompanying adults won't find it hard to sit through.",7,2,5,24 February 2011
21 Jump Street," Very funny in parts but didn't sustain it
",21 Jump Street is funny in parts but doesn't keep a high quality of laughs throughout.The story (based very loosely on the old TV series) is about two young cops who went to the same school but only became friends when they are in the police academy. Due to their youthful looks and poor policing skills they are assigned to an undercover operation trying to stop the supply of a new drug in a high school.Due to a mix up in their cover names the cop who was nerdy at school ends up hanging out with the 'cool kids' and vice versa. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum are well cast as the odd couple of cops who thereby end up learning a lot about friendship by the time the movie ends. They are also Executive Producers by the way.The movie is unashamedly crude in the spirit of American Pie and Superbad and that is not a criticism even if I found the bad language a bit tiresome by the end. There are a constant stream of jokes and funny situations through the movie but overall I thought that not enough of them were funny enough to justify giving it a high rating. There have been so many US high school comedies that a movie really has to be something special to stand out from the crowd.,7,1,1,4 April 2012
Burn After Reading," Lighter But Still Good
","I thoroughly enjoyed this film, which sees the Coen's get back on more comedic ground after the darkness of 'No Country For Old Men'.I think I read somewhere that a lot of movies are about ordinary people who find themselves in extraordinary situation through no fault of their own. In this film the characters seem to get themselves into trouble through their own character flaws, greed, stupidity,paranoia,and hubris to name a few. The acting is excellent. Pitt has no problem making himself look foolish. Malkovich plays the self absorbed former CIA agent brilliantly. McDormand is great as the unhappy gym worker, determined to turn her life around at almost any cost. However I find myself tiring of twitches in Clooney's performance that he seems rely on in most of his comedic performances such as in 'O Brother, Where Art Thou' and 'Intolerable Cruelty'. Pesonally I was delighted to see David Rasche, from the brilliant 'Sledge Hammer' TV show of many years ago.It is certainly miles away from 'No Country...' but the Coens still though a few curve-balls at us when we least expect them and that helps the film rise above run of the mill comedies.Treat yourself to a good laugh, go and see this.",8,2,6,29 September 2008
Kung Fu Panda 2," Enjoyable sequel
","I enjoyed 'Kung Fu Panda' and am happy to report that the sequel is nearly as funny and smart as the original.The animation is again top class, with bright colours and brilliant facial expressions bringing the characters to life.The story is about the Po's search for how he was separated from his family as a cub and is quite touching and sad at times. Shen, the evil character that broke up his family, has returned and is trying to take over China this time.As in the first film there are some spectacular action sequences to keep the kids happy. Perhaps there isn't as much smart humour for the benefit of the adults as in the first movie but this is still a great movie for all the family.Jack Black is perfect as the voice of Po and the surprisingly stellar supporting cast (Angelina Jolie/Dustin Hoffman) again do a great job.The ending leaves the viewer almost certain that there will be a third movie, so I'll look forward to that also.",7,0,1,12 July 2011
Coriolanus," An excellent modern day version by Fiennes
","I enjoyed this version a lot. I wasn't that familiar with the Coriolanus plot so it was interesting to see the story develop about a very good general who becomes a very bad politician.The film uses Shakespeare's dialogue but it is set in modern times. However it still resonated for me as we see the influence of populist politics and politicians in the affairs of state.The plot is about a general who wins a great victory and is selected to be the next consul of Rome. However he regards the ordinary people with little more than contempt and his obvious discomfort in even pretending to compromise in this belief results in his banishment. There is a great scene set in a TV studio where Coriolans confronts those opposed to him in something not far removed from the Jerry Springer show. He then unites with a former enemy of Rome in order to gain his revenge.I'm not Fiennes' biggest fan and I thought he over egged the pudding in a few of his speeches. Too much spittle and not enough subtlety perhaps, though the character of Coriolanus is not a very subtle man, either as a soldier or as a politician.I loved Vanessa Redgrave as his powerful and influential mother. Brian Cox is also excellent as the decent Senator. Gerard Butler is also good as Coriolanus' sworn enemy turned ally, Aufidius.The movie uses the familiar setting (from TV news) of modern war zones to demonstrate Coriolanus' best characteristics as a fearless soldier.An excellent version of one of Shakepeare's lesser known plays",8,6,11,5 February 2012
Hugo," Scorsese's children's movie takes an unexpected detour
","Hugo begins as a great kids movie but perhaps Scorsese gets a bit distracted and takes us on a detour involving the birth of the movie industry. Hugo is an orphan who lives in a Parisian railway station and whose job is to wind the clocks in the station. His life story is quite sad and the opening part of the movie explains how he became an orphan.In his spare time he is rebuilding a metal robot that his father was working on when he died. While looking for spare parts for the robot he has a confrontation with an elderly man who runs a toy shop in the station. The man (played by Ben Kingsley) also seems to have a sad life story that he doesn't want to share. Hugo also meets the godchild of the shop owner (Chloe Sevigny) who introduces him to world of books.Scorsese's consummate movie making skill is evident from nearly every shot as he brilliantly creates the magical world of the railway station and Hugo's life within its walls.However towards the end of the movie Scorsese decides to change the main theme of the movie and it becomes an explanation of the early days of European cinema. I think that this part of the movie may not appeal to younger viewers who will be more interested in Hugo's story, which is overshadowed for the last part of the movie.I enjoyed the movie but perhaps children won't appreciate Scorsese's homage to early cinema towards the end.",7,2,4,30 December 2011
"I, Robot"," Run of the mill action movie
","Though based on the book by Isaac Asimov this movie is definitely structured as a vehicle for Will Smith rather than a faithful version of a sci-fi classic.Set in the future where robots are a part of everyday life Smith stars as a cop investigating the apparent suicide of the scientist that did most to develop robots. Needless to say Smiths character, who is very suspicious of robots, suspects there is more to his death than meets the eye.From here the movie takes a fairly predictable course as we learn more about the cops back-story, get a huge number of wisecracks from Smith, meet a pretty scientist (Bridget Moynahan) and are treated to some admittedly spectacular action sequences.However, at the end of the movie you realise there was very little memorable about it at all.",6,1,2,3 May 2012
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," Good spoof of music biopics
","'Walk Hard' is an excellent a parody of musical biopics and in particular 'Walk The Line'. Made by the team that gave us Knocked Up and Superbad fun is poked at showbiz biopic standards like a hectic love life, multiple forms of substance abuse, numerous offspring and a glorious late-career comeback. The laughs come thick and fast. Some of the jokes are a bit lame but not to worry as another one is just around the corner. The constant stream of gags is reminiscent of the 'Airplane' and 'Naked Gun' movies. John McGinley is perfect as the clueless Dewey. Familiar faces such as Jenna Fischer and Kirsten Wiig appear and there are cameos from Frankie Muniz and Harold Ramis among many others.A perfect film with guaranteed laughs when you feel like a night in with a DVD.",7,0,0,12 July 2010
Disturbia," By the number thriller but still worth watching
",There isn't much originality in 'Disturbia' but it is pretty enjoyable for a by the numbers thriller.Shia LaBoeuf plays a troubled teen whose father was killed in a road accident when the younger man was driving. He struggles to deal with this and after hitting a teacher at school he is sentenced to house arrest for three months during the summer holidays. If he strays more than a few yards from his house the sensor on his leg will alert the police. He mopes about the house for a while as his mother is out at work but then goes into 'Rear Window' mode and starts observing what his neighbours are up to. Meanwhile on the news there are reports of a local woman gone missing.He becomes even more interested in the neighbours when the hottest girl in all of Christendom moves in next door. This gives an excuse for some pretty prurient shots of her undressing and getting in and out of the pool. It's pretty clear that the movie is aimed at viewers the same age as our protagonist.Predictably the sensor is no barrier to the hot girl becoming friends with him. Obviously she likes bad boys! She joins him in spying on the neighbours and they see the creepy man across the street moving what may be a body. He also drives the type of car mentioned in news reports about the missing woman!! You can see where this is going.As the kids begin to investigate there are a few decent frights and suspenseful scenes but the ending doesn't hold any real surprises.The best thing about the film is the performances of LaBoeuf and Sara Roemer as the main investigating kids. They have good chemistry and play their bored but cool teenage characters quite well. David Morse is suitably creepy as the neighbour acting suspiciously and Carrie-Anne Moss makes a welcome appearance as LaBoeuf's mother.An enjoyable thriller to rent on DVD if you fancy some thrills but don't want to test your brain too much.,7,2,4,12 August 2010
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Simply Very Funny
","Quite simply this is a very funny film. Given the subject matter it could have been pretty crude and one dimensional. However it is a thoughtful and interesting movie. Basically a nerdy computer store worker lets slip to his male co-workers that he is a virgin. They make fun of him at first but then vow to help him 'break his duck'. Hilarity ensues. However we gradually see that his friends have plenty of relationship issues of their own and maybe they aren't the best people to be advising him. One minus point would be that the film is maybe 15 minutes to long. The problems between Carell's and Keener's characters are dragged out just a bit. Great performances from Carrell, Keener, Rudd and Rogan and from the rest of the excellent supporting cast. My favourite bits? -The waxing scene - (of course) - Jonah Hill trying to buy the platform heeled shoes in the eBay shop - The Age of Aquarius number over the closing credits",8,0,2,7 July 2009
Shrek Forever After," Enjoyable but not much originality
","Shrek 4 is enjoyable but it is clear the franchise has reached the end of its tether. There are a few good gags and the affection we have for the main characters almost wills us to enjoy the ride but we are going over very familiar territory.Shrek becomes bored with mundane family life and does a deal with Rumplestiltskin for a day as a 'real' ogre. In return Rumplestliltskin gets to erase the day Shrek was born which means (the details aren't really important) that Mr R now rules Far Far Away. As a character Rumplestiltskin has a few amusing quirks, such as having a different wig for every occasion and having witches for henchmen. However he isn't as entertaining as the original characters.The rest of the film involves Shrek trying to get out of the deal as well as convincing Fiona (who now doesn't know him) that he is her true love. We also meet alternative reality versions of Puss and Donkey.The kids will enjoy the slapstick and funny voices but accompanying adults will realise early on that this film was really only made for the money.",7,0,1,7 July 2010
Duck You Sucker," A lesser known Leone Western but very entertaining
","The cover of this DVD gives the incorrect impression that 'A Fistful of Dynamite' is a comedy. There are comic elements in the movie but the overall it is a fine multi-layered story. Rod Steiger plays a Mexican bandit who dreams of robbing a large bank. When he meets an Irish explosives expert (James Coburn) working in Mexico he sees his chance to bring his dreams to reality. However the country is in the throes of a revolution and both their plans are changed forever by the intrusion of this conflict. The film features some typical Leone touches such as a long opening scene with a surprise twist and an Ennio Morricone score. The film is over two and a half hours long but apart from one sequence it doesn't feel too long as the plot twists and turns with plenty of action sequences as well. There some interesting themes explored such as friendship, loyalty, treachery and sacrifice. There were some parts of the movie I didn't enjoy as much. The score is a bit annoying at times (the 'Sean Sean Sean' song in particular!), Steigers Mexican (Russian?) accent is more distracting than Coburn's passable Irish one and the series of scenes where Steiger tries to persuade Coburn to help him rob the bank drags on for too long. There are some great action set pieces of battles, prison breaks and train crashes. It differs from Leone's Westerns with Clint Eastwood by painting on a broader canvas, using the revolution as a background. If you are a fan of Leone's better-known Westerns 'A Fistful of Dynamite' is definitely worth seeing.",7,0,0,2 December 2010
Tropic Thunder," Scatter Gun tactics mostly hit the target
","A few reviews of this film had said the funniest part of it was the 'mock' trailers at the beginning, used to introduce the main characters. I thought they weren't THAT funny and began to think I mightn't enjoy the film that much. Thankfully I was wrong. The first half hour is pretty slow as the completely ridiculous plot is set up but once the action gets into the jungle it rattles along. Jokes come at you at a frequency not seen since the Naked Gun movies. Obviously they aren't all funny but I thought that most of them were.I have to mention the 're-enactment' by Stiller's character's of one of his film roles at the 'request' of the Thai drug gang. I was doubled over with laughter.I really like Ben Stiller. You have to admire someone who makes himself look utterly ridiculous in nearly every film he's in. Jack Black and Robert Downey Junior follow Stiller's example by not having a problem looking silly. The supporting cast are also excellent. Tom Cruise goes so far against type as the movie executive you wonder is he in on the joke!And even if you go to see a bald Cruise in a fat suit doing 'that' dance during the closing credits you'll think it was money well spent.There are a few comments going around that the film could be seen as offensive to African Americans of people with mental disabilities. I have a family member who is mentally disabled and the film was in no way offensive to me. I'd be surprised if African American found the Downey's character offensive as that joke is aimed the acting profession.Definitely a must see!",8,1,2,17 October 2008
District 9," Alien movie that thinks outside the box
","Director/writer Neil Blomkamp and Producer Peter Jackson have come up with an interesting addition to the 'Alien v human' genre. Helpless aliens were found on a ship hovering over Johannesburg. They weren't hostile and were housed in a ghetto (District 9) for twenty years. However their numbers have now increased and relations with humans have got worse. It has been decided to move them to a purpose built ghetto, further away form the city. A multi national corporation that just happens to make weapons has been hired to ensure the move goes off smoothly. We meet the not very pleasant Wikus Van De Merwe, whose job it is to get the aliens to sign the move agreement by hook or by crook. During this chaotic process Pontus accidentally comes into contact with alien DNA. Soon he starts to notice physical changes to his body. His employers notice this too. They have been trying for years to make the powerful alien weaponry work. However it only operates when in contact with alien DNA. Having established that their employees DNA is changing to part alien this is an opportunity too good to miss. The brutal initial tests are successful and they decide to 'harvest' Van De Merwe's DNA before he dies. However he escapes and goes on the run. His metamorphosis continues and he heads to District 9 where he hopes he will be harder to find. Here he meets up with an alien and his son who he 'met' during the moving process. It turns this alien has moving plans of his own but needs Van De Merwe's help. The movie has a lot of breathless chase sequences but is also quite moving in parts as we have sympathy with the alien and his son and with Van De Merwe and his wife and their lives fall apart. The film threatened to lose momentum half way through but recovered well for an excellent closing sequence. The special effects are very good. The human/alien interaction is excellent and Van De Merwe's gradual gruesome transformation in suitably unsettling. The plot is a tad far fetched at times but this is only to be expected in a film of this kind. The fast pace of the film doesn't lend itself to great displays of acting but Sharlto Copley as Van De Merwe is very good in the main role as the man whose life and body are falling apart. This is South Africa's most successful film ever and deserves all the acclaim it has received.",8,4,8,17 November 2009
Mamma Mia!," Very Enjoyable But Meryl is a Bit Scary!
","First a short summary. This film is a musical that uses the songs of Abba as a backdrop to a story about a girl who invites 3 men, one of whom is her father, to her wedding on a Greek island. She doesn't tell her mother this so needless to say much fun ensues before the inevitable happy ending. How could it fail? Thankfully it doesn't! I hadn't seen the stage musical but that really doesn't matter as the film is very good on it's own merits. The excellent supporting including Julie Walters, Christine Baranski, Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth and Stellan Skarsgard are all obviously having a ball. Perhaps the least said about some of their singing and dancing abilities the better!The film is comedic most of the time though there are a few moving moments, especially a few dealing with the mother-daughter relationship.I'll make one point that really struck me during the film. Given the bright and breezy nature of the story I found Meryl Streep's performance very intense. It wasn't like watching her in 'Sophie's Choice' but she seemed to emphasise the regrets and sadness her character had about her life and parenting skills. I must add that this didn't take away from my enjoyment of the film, as it is never long before the next dance routine came up!So if you want to have a laugh and sing along to Abba (if only to yourself) go and see Mamma Mia.",8,3,3,22 October 2008
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Long but worth it for the great story it tells
","'The Hobbit -An Unexpected Journey' is an enjoyable movie that lives up to the high standards of director Peter Jackson's 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy.Some sequences are too long such as the feast scenes where we meet the dwarfs and the escape from the Goblins. However this doesn't take away too much from the high quality of the movie.The story of a hobbit joining the dwarf's quest to recover their gold from a fierce dragon is just that - a great story- and Jackson tells it well, with plenty of help from a rousing score, New Zealand scenery and CGI effects.The acting is good though none of the characters has a lot of depth. Martin Freeman, in particular, is good as Bilbo Baggins, who surprises himself by deciding to leave the quiet Shire to wander through Middle Earth with complete strangers. The scene where he meets Gollum, played by Andy Sirkis, s particularly memorable.",7,0,4,6 February 2013
The Princess Bride," Innovative but not hilarious
","I had been meaning to watch 'The Princess Bride' in full for ages and finally got around to it. I enjoyed it but was slightly disappointed.The movie opens with a sick young boy being visited by his grandfather, who offers to read him a story. The boy isn't very enthusiastic at first but he gradually realises that this fairy story is slightly different to those he has heard before.The script (by Hollywood royalty William Goldman)is full of comic one-liners that are mostly aimed at adults, while the basic framework stays within the fairy tale genre with a beautiful princess, a handsome hero and a nasty villain determined to get his way.While it is very watchable, I thought the film wasn't consistently funny enough for adults, though kids will probably be happy enough with the fight and chase scenes The performances are excellent, particularly Peter Falk as the grandfather, Robin Wright as Princess Buttercup and Carey Elwes as the hero. The supporting cast are also very good.",7,0,1,12 January 2012
The Chorus," Entertaining feel-good French movie
","'The Chorus' is an entertaining, rather sentimental movie. The theme of a new character coming to a school and turning the life of the children around isn't original but it is dealt with well here.A famous conductor's mother dies. He returns to France for the funeral and memories of his childhood come flooding back when an old school pal comes to visit. We then go back in time to see Clement Mathieu (G√©rard Jugnot ) starting work at a remote boarding school for troublesome boys. The headmaster thinks that harsh discipline is the only way to keep control of the school. Naturally the new employee thinks differently and through his own love of music he tries to make the kids lives a bit better.The film is beautifully shot, using the countryside and the old building that serves as the school to give us a feeling of the enclosed world of the boys. The sets and costumes are also excellent in giving us the sense of the era the film is set. The child actors are very good and the script does well to develop a lot of the boy's characters rather than just concentrating on one or two.The ending might be too sweet for some people's liking. If it were a Hollywood movie there would probably be howls of derision that it wasn't gritty enough. However it is in keeping with the sentimental theme going through the movie.",7,0,0,8 April 2010
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Thrilling reboot of the franchise
","I wasn't expecting much with this movie but I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it.It is part action thriller, part sci-fi part prison drama and by rattling along at a frenetic pace it doesn't allow you to think too much about any plot holes.The basic plot premise is that a chimp whose mother had been given an experimental drug for Alzheimers is smuggled out of the the lab. It seems the drug has given this chimp an amazing intellect (for a chimp anyway.) Eventually he comes into contact with other apes and it starts to start looking bad from here for humanity. At less than two hours the running time is perfect to keep the pace of the movie going and there is a great climactic action sequence on the Golden Gate Bridge. There is also a subtle tie back to the 60's Charlton Heston 'Planet of the Ape' movies.No doubt there will be sequels to follow and based on this franchise opener I'll be looking forward to them.",Null,0,3,17 September 2011
Drive," Excellent thriller with more than a hint of menace
","Drive is a stylishly made look at the Los Angeles criminal underworld but without the humorous quips of a Tarantino movie.Ryan Gosling plays the unnamed driver. He works as a Hollywood stunt driver but, for a price, he also is available as a top class getaway driver.He also works in a garage and his boss (Bryan Cranston) thinks he can use his talent to get on the stock car racing circuit.The driver seems to be the archetypal loner but when a young woman (Carey Mulligan) and her son move in next door he tries to help them out when he can. Her husband is to come out of jail soon but when he does he has debts to repay and his only chance to repay them is by taking part in a robbery. Because of his feelings for the ex-con's wife the driver offers to help. Inevitably the heist goes wrong and the driver finds himself on the run from some very nasty people.At this point the slow moving pace of the first half of the movie changes and it becomes extremely violent. We can only imagine the drivers past history as he proves adept at protecting himself and inflicting pain on others. We realise that he is capable of doing anything if he feels he needs to.The movie plays out to a suitably downbeat ending.Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn unashamedly sets out to make a stylish and indeed arty movie. There are plenty of awkward silences and slow motion sequences, particularly when he wants us to know that the driver and his neighbour 'FALLING IN LOVE'.There are a lot of reason why this movie shouldn't worked but it is so well written, shot and acted that I really enjoyed it.The soundtrack is also brilliant.",8,1,4,1 November 2011
Kick-Ass," Another original from Vaughn
","I was highly impressed by Matthew Vaughn's first effort at directing in 'Layer Cake', a gritty look at London's gangland. With 'Kick Ass' he has again produced a highly original take on a popular genre, this time the superhero film.For the first hour it was hard to tell where the film was going. It starts with a geeky high school student deciding to 'become' a superhero. He buys a uniform and hits the street, determined to do good. As you might expect this doesn't go as he would have hoped. From there however the film takes off into unexpected and highly entertaining territory, which I won't spoil by describing in too much detail.Unlike 'Spiderman' and other movies from that genre the violence depicted is quite graphic and this comes as a shock at first. Trailers I saw gave the impression that the film is a comedy but most of the humour is very black indeed.Young Aaron Johnson ‚Äì last seen as John Lennon in Nowhere Boy ‚Äì is spot on the gormless but well meaning teenager getting a lot more than he bargained for. Nicolas Cage nearly steals the film with his Adam West impression! Chloe Moretz is great as Cage's daughter, definitely not a young girl to judge on first impressions! It was also enjoyable to spot the many UK actors in the supporting cast that Vaughan brought across the Atlantic with him.So apart from a pretty pointless teen romance side story I really enjoyed this film",8,4,14,17 May 2010
Gran Torino," Do not go gently into the night
","Another high quality film from Clint Eastwood. When you look at his track record he is definitely one of the great living Hollywood directors. He has a great eye for a story that will grab people's attention. Gran Torino is about a lot of things, aging, family relationships, the immigrant experience amongst others. The story is quite simple. Walt (Eastwood),a widower living alone in an area of suburban Detroit now mostly inhabited by Asian immigrants. He dislikes them intensely and doesn't try to hide it word or deed. Due to an incident he (almost despite himself)becomes close to the young Asian boy living next door. He tries to pass on his beliefs on what is right and how a man should behave to the boy and they become friends. However local tensions arise again with tragic consequences and Walt has to make a decision about what is the right thing to do, knowing it will effect him, the boy and the boy's family. Eastwood is excellent, literally growling through some scenes as Walt expresses his (mostly negative)opinions about the world around him. In more than one scene he plays to good effect with the 'Man with NoName' and 'Dirty Harry' characters the audience associate with Eastwood. The middle part of the film, as Walt and his neighbour become best buddies is very funny at times, though we know somehow that violence will rear it's ugly head before the end. A moral tale then and one well worth watching.",8,3,7,28 February 2009
The Hurt Locker," It takes all sorts to make an army
","Kathryn Bigelow has made a well-crafted and interesting film about the day-to-day life of US troops in Iraq. We follow a three-man bomb disposal team. This gives the opportunity for many tense scenes as they deal with various devices left by Iraqi insurgents.Two of team want to do their job as well as possible but, having recently seen their previous leader blown up, are also anxious to avoid any unnecessary risks. However the new team leader shocks them by seeming to thrive on taking as many risks as possible. This leads to conflict. The leader(played by Jeremy Renner) is disliked by the others but they all know they have to work together in very stressful situations to stay alive. The bomb disposal scenes are very well done as the director gradually builds the tension and keeps us guessing. There are also scenes of more 'normal' army life.The message of the movie is that while most soldiers just want to survive, some depend on the adrenalin rush of being in danger and cannot replicate this in life away from the front line.The excellent cast show the fear in the soldier's eyes as potentially deadly situations take turns for the worse. I was anxious to see this film as it had won the 2009 Best Film Oscar. I was slightly disappointed with it as it is not as memorable or original as I'd hoped. Perhaps the action sequences had more of an impact in the cinema. However it is certainly a movie worth seeing.",7,1,3,25 November 2010
Brave," Mother and daughter animation movie
","This Pixar animated movie focuses on a sometimes-fraught relationship between a teenage daughter and her mothers.Set in Scotland in 'olden times' we meet Princess Merida, who loves nothing better than riding her horse and practicing her archery. However her mother, Queen Elinor, feels she should be more ladylike, especially since she intends to marry her daughter off to one of the sons of the local clan lords for political reasons. Merida is not pleased with this at all and there is a big argument. After meeting a witch Merida asks for a spell to 'change' her mother. Of course this doesn't go as she expects and the action really begins.Unlike most animation movies the plot takes a few twists I didn't expect. As with all Pixar movies the animation is of the highest quality. The makers are obviously very proud of the job they did on creating Merida's red curly hair as it literally shines out from almost every scene! There are familiar voices doing the main roles, such as Kelly MacDonald, Billy Connolly and Emma Thompson.A very enjoyable movie for both young and old",7,1,2,17 August 2012
The Hangover Part II," Sequel in 'Not as good as the Original' shock horror
","I took a bit of a flyer and decided to see The Hangover 2. I enjoyed the original as despite plenty of coarse moments it managed not to cross the line into complete tastelessness.Perhaps predictably the sequel makes the mistake of crossing this line, leaving the viewer feeling slightly dirty as they leave the cinema. The plot is very similar to the original; except that it is set in Thailand, where one of the lads is getting married.They again wake up having no idea what happened to them the night before and have to retrace their steps to find a missing brother in law to be.No point in describing the plot in any more detail. Zach Galifianikis again gets the best lines, though they are not as plentiful as in the original.And we now know Mike Tyson can't sing.",6,0,0,10 June 2011
Annie Hall," A very good comedy rather than an all time classic
","I was slightly disappointed after watching 'Annie Hall'. It is touted as one of the all time great films. While it is an enjoyable film but I don't think it quite lives up to its reputation.Diane Keaton won a Best Actress Oscar for her performance and she is the best thing in it. She plays Annie, initially as an awkward wannabe nightclub singer but later becoming a confident young woman at the expense of her relationship with Allen's character.The main characters in the movie are great. From Keaton's Annie to Allen's neurotic writer they are a bit mad but you come to like them a lot and wish the best for them. I thought Allen throws in too many 'funny' lines for his character, especially at the start of the movie. Some of these lines just aren't funny and you just want him to get on with the story.There are some great scenes in the movie. I thought the visit to Annie's family in the Mid-west was hilarious, complete with Jew-hating 'Grammy Hall' and a cameo from a young Christopher Walken.Definitely worth watching, perhaps along with 'Manhattan', a movie from the same period in Allen's career.",7,2,4,4 October 2011
Avatar," Great technical achievement - story not so good
","Avatar looks great. You can see where the millions of dollars have spent in the making of it. The forest and flying scenes are brilliantly done. The technology enabling the movement of the native people to be based on the actions of the actor playing them is flawless. However for my first 3D movie and I was a bit disappointed that there weren't more arrows flying past my shoulder. Maybe my expectations were a bit high! I prefer my films with a bit of character development and a decent story and here Avatar is a bit lacking. The story is about an ex-marine working for a company hoping to make a fortune from the 'Unobtainium' (really) found in abundance on the planet of Pandora. The cynical executives running the company pay lip service to environmentalism by building schools for the natives and employing scientists. However they also have a large army of mercenaries who will be used to remove the natives if they won't go voluntarily. They have also developed genetically modified 'avatars'. They look like the natives but are mind linked to human controllers. They hope to use them to persuade the natives that it would be in their best interest to move. Eventually our hero, through his avatar, ends up living with the natives and falls in love with their spiritual ways and closeness to nature. However he is also under orders from the mercenaries to get information on the best way to destroy the native camp if necessary. He has a moral dilemma. You know which way that will go and there is a big battle in the end.So the visuals are excellent. You will definitely enjoy the ride! The cast are very much secondary to the special effects though Stephen Lang is brilliantly over the top as the macho head of the mercenaries. However the story borrows too much from the likes of 'Lord of the Rings' and 'Transformers' to make it a truly satisfying cinema experience that will remain with you.",7,2,4,9 February 2010
The Artist," A unique treat
","I always worry when I go to movie that has received a lot of hype. I'm afraid that I will be disappointed but that certainly wasn't the case with 'The Artist'.How can a black & white silent movie work in this day and age? Perhaps it is because the most important thing in any movie is the story and the characters. In 'The Artist' both of these draw the viewer in so much that the lack of dialogue is irrelevant.The acting, especially that of Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo, also helps to sweep the viewer along in the simple tale of the contrasting fortunes of the silent movie star and the young starlet at the start of the talkies era in Hollywood. The scene where Bejo pretends to dance with her idols jacket is surely destined to become one of the all time great movie scenes. Dujardin brilliantly portrays the voyage from cocky superstar to has-been.The score in a silent movie is vital and it succeeds brilliantly in setting the mood of each scene.You can argue, and indeed you would be correct, that the lack of dialogue is a gimmick. If the same director and cast decided to make another silent movie it probably wouldn't work. However with this story it does work and it has resulted in the creation of a treat for movie fans.",8,3,6,29 February 2012
Invictus," Conventional telling of an inspiring tale
","Eastwood has made an entertaining if conventional film about the South African 1995 rugby World Cup winning team and their relationship with President Nelson Mandela. For someone reasonably familiar with the politics ‚Äìsporting and otherwise ‚Äì of South Africa the sometimes clumsy insertion of explanations grated a bit. However, given that a US audience could not be expected to be very familiar with the significance of the Springbok team as a symbol of the apartheid regime the presence of these explanations is easily forgiven.I remember the watching Mandela's release from Robben Island live on television and I am also a sports follower and for these reasons the historic nature of the events portrayed in the film did resonate with me.The story itself doesn't need to deviate much from actual events. Mandela's story itself is inspiring. Eastwood wisely picks a chapter from it that shows how he understood that he had to try to bring the white population into the new 'rainbow nation' he was trying to build. Francois Pienaar was a great leader himself. His relationship with Mandela is dealt with well in the film. We see him gradually grasping and supporting Mandela's ideas for the new South Africa as many whites must have done during this period.The game footage is well filmed and accurate. For example Andrew Mehrten's chance to win the final in normal time for New Zealand is shown.Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon are predictably excellent in the main roles. The supporting cast are also very good. The conclusion of the film takes the familiar path of most sporting underdog films. Plenty of slow motion build up and inspiring music to the decisive kick by Stransky!A very well made movie. It is not the definitive Mandela biopic that will one day be made and will show in detail his political and personal struggle. I thoroughly enjoyed it nonetheless.",7,0,0,10 March 2010
Up," Very Uplifting....(I couldn't resist!)
","Pixar and Disney have again come up with the goods with the funny and touching movie.The first ten minutes show a young Carl Fredriksen (voiced by the legendary Edward Asner), fascinated by the explorers he sees on newsreels. He meets a kindred spirit in Ellie and we see their life together until she passes away. This segment lets us see Carl's character and is very moving.Carl continues to live alone in his house until a run in with a developer sees him destined to be shipped off to a retirement home. Facing this prospect he decides to go to Paradise Falls, an almost mythical place he and Ellie had always meant to go to but never did.Here the film really takes off (see what I did there?) as Carl opts to travel via his balloon-fuelled house. Only when he is in the air does he find that a boy scout in search of a last merit badge for helping the aged has become an unwitting stowaway.Our odd couple eventually land near their destination but trouble awaits as they cross swords with an unexpected jungle resident.I didn't see the 3D version but the animation is still brilliant with the colours of the jungle amazingly vibrant. The story is also excellent. We empathise with Carl and his young friend as they reveal their stories and come to rely on each other. The chase sequences are straight out Indiana Jones and breathtaking (even in non-3D). While there is a 'message' it isn't rammed home at the expense of making the film enjoyable.One small complaint would be the film is perhaps too long at over 90 minutes and dragged a bit towards the end. So, while it is not as good as the peerless 'Toy Story' it is a very enjoyable film for all ages and well worthy of being listed with the other Pixar classics.",8,0,0,21 October 2009
Zombieland," A Zombie movie with a heart
","Zombieland is full of zombies but left me feeling good about humanity. The plot is thin but the characters are very likable and the fact that I wanted them to be okay kept me interested in the film until the end. Describing the plot won't take long. After a zombie plague very few humans have survived. Four of them decide to travel together to LA where there may be a Zombie free area and/or Twinkies. The four are: uber geek Jesse Eisenberg, redneck Woody Harrelson and grifter sisters, Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin.Eisenberg has a long list of rules for survival in a zombie filled world and we see in flashback why he came up with some of them.Most of the film consists of our four heroes having gory/funny encounters with zombies. The dialogue is funny and the acting is good. Abigail Breslin is growing up at an alarming rate but is perhaps wasted in the smallest role as the younger sister. Eisenberg and Stone have good chemistry in their roles and look set to gave decent Hollywood careers. Harrelson is perfect as the wisecracking NASCAR fan who loves nothing better than killing zombies.A comparison with 'Shaun of the Dead' is inevitable. The English film had a stronger plot line so perhaps I would give it the edge. Although Zombieland has Bill Murray as himself pretending to be a zombie so he can play golf in peace! That must count for something.This is a funny film with its heart in the right place. The films message, or at least the one I gleaned from it, is that people need to help each other to make the best out of life. I enjoyed it in the cinema but it would also be a perfect DVD for a night in.",7,2,4,18 November 2009
All Quiet on the Western Front," Ground Breaking anti war movie
","While most movies made these days almost automatically take an anti war slant (eg Jarhead) back in the 1930's most war films had a Boys Own feel to them, emphasising only the glory and honour of battle. In it's day then, All Quiet on the Western Front really broke new ground by overtly criticising the pro-war rhetoric that was common on all sides in the First World War. It also shows in grim the detail the appalling conditions the soldiers lived in on the front and the inadequacy of the training the young volunteers received. There are some good scenes showing the soldiers coping as best they can with food shortages. The varied reaction to the soldiers to non stop artillery bombardment is also great , though tough to watch. Even though the famous final scene is familiar even to people who haven't seen the film it still has a great impact. The same goes for the replaying of the young friends first march to the front before the end titles. The scene showing the machine gunners slaughtering the soldiers in a frontal assault is also harrowing as first the French and then the German infantry die in their droves.To a modern eye some aspects of the film jar slightly, such as the over the top acting (eg Lew Ayers in the main role) and a few melodramatic scenes.Overrall, though it really is an excellent movie and has stood the test of time.",8,2,3,27 March 2009
Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist," We didn't miss it. This is it
","This is a nice feel good movie. The plot is far fetched at times and the characters aren't always well drawn but I found myself liking most of them.Musician Nick is heartbroken after splitting up with high school student Tris. She goes to his band's gig in New York City with two of her schoolmates, one of whom is Norah, who is cool but not very confident. After the gig Nick and Norah meet when she asks him to pretend to be her boyfriend (don't ask why!). They discover they both like the same music so they search in his decrepit Yugo for ubercool band, 'Where's Fluffy?' who are playing a secret gig somewhere in the city. Meanwhile Nick's gay band mates agree to take Norah's very drunk other friend ‚Äì Caroline- home in their van.So we follow these characters around NYC as the night turns into morning. Nick and Norah like each other but then fall out. Tris gets jealous of Norah and decides she wants Nick back. You can see where this is going, right?So nothing wildly original but the movie does have a few things going for it. The cast seem to get on really well and appear to have enjoyed making the movie. Michael Cera plays the same character he played in Juno and Scott Pilgrim (and indeed Superbad). You have to admit he is good at playing the likable nerdy guy. He and Kat Dennings, who plays Norah, have good chemistry as the erstwhile couple and you want them to end up together. Ari Graynor is particularly funny as Caroline, who is drunk for 90% of the movie.There are a few negatives to the movie. The plot stretches your disbelief to the limit at times. On street parking seems to be no problem in New York City. Towards the end of the movie a plot line about Norah's lack of sexual experience is raised rather needlessly in my opinion. However it is resolved reasonably well in a scene at the climax of the movie. (That line is funnier if you've seen the movie!). Nick's ex-girlfriend Tris is a character with no redeeming features. She is the complete opposite of 'good girl' Norah, which jarred a bit for me.'Nick and Norah's¬Ö¬Ö.' is partly romcom, partly teen comedy and partly farce and it will keep a smile on your face for most of it's running time.It also gets an extra star from me for a couple of brilliant romantic lines at the end of the movie, after Nick and Norah leave the 'Where's Fluffy' concert early.Norah - Are you sad that we missed it? Nick - We didn't miss it. This is it.",7,0,1,8 March 2011
There Will Be Blood," No change here
","I read somewhere that in nearly every film the main character changes in a profound way and the story is about how and why that change occurs.Well that doesn't happen in this film. Daniel Plainview remains the same from when he prospects alone for silver to when he lives alone in the mansion paid for with the oil he has found.He is unable to interact with others in any meaningful way and decides therefore to have as little to do with them as possible. What makes it sadder is that he is aware of this trait and would like it to be otherwise. Why else would he adopt a strangers child or open up his heart to someone claiming to be his long lost brother?These attempts at human contact fail however and he always returns to what he is good at - business and making money and makes his most important decisions based on purely commercial grounds, for example sending his son away to deaf school.However in the back of his mind he knows there is something missing in his life and starts to rely on drink to ease the pain. He shouts 'Bastard in a basket' after his deaf son, who he knows cannot hear him. Obviously trying to convince himself that he has no love for the child. He seems to consider his son going into the same business, even at a small level as the ultimate betrayal.Lewis' performance is outstanding. However I found the darkness of the story tough going.",7,3,7,27 March 2008
To Kill a Mockingbird," An enjoyable film but some interesting scenes omitted from the book
","To Kill a Mockingbird is a very enjoyable movie with great acting though if you have read the book before seeing it you will probably, like me, be disappointed that some of the scenes in the book are changed or omitted.For that reason I would recommend seeing the movie before reading the book, if possible. It is filmed in black and white, which is perfect for giving a sense of the time the film is set in.The story is about two young children in small town 1930's Alabama, learning about life mainly from their widowed father. Their widowed father, Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck), is the hero of the film. He is a quietly spoken lawyer but is determined to set a good example by how he deals with people. The plot comes to a head when he is appointed to defend an innocent black man from an accusation of rape from a local white girl. The racial prejudices that were always just beneath the surface in the town come to the fore. The trial scene takes up a good portion of the film. This makes sense, as it is a perfect cinematic set piece and has some great acting from Peck and the supporting cast.A great bonus on the DVD I purchased is an excellent 90 minute documentary titled 'Fearful Symmetry'. Made in 1999 it has interviews with Gregory Peck, the director Robert Mulligan, writer Horton Foote and producer Alan J. Pakula. There also interviews with other cast members such as Robert Duvall, who played the crucial character of Boo Radley, Brock Peters, Collin Wilcox Paxton and the now grown up child actors. There are some great insights and anecdotes about the filming. This film is also a documentary about Monroeville, the hometown of the author Harper Lee. In the book she used Monroeville as a basis for the town of Maycomb and there are interviews with residents who lived in the town in the period the film was set in. These have plenty of examples of the famous laid back Southern way of life we hear so much about. There also interviews that discuss the significance of the book and the film in highlighting the racial discrimination of the time. At times the narration becomes quite wordy but overall the documentary is well worth watching.",7,0,0,4 November 2010
Ice Age: Continental Drift," Run of the mill story- excellent animation
","Run of the mill story ‚Äì Excellent animation Top class animation doesn't make up for a weak storyline in the latest Ice Age movie but it probably won't matter to the makers. After all it's the fourth movie in the series so they must be doing something right.There are big names doing the voices, Denis Leary, Ray Romano, Queen Latifah, Sean William Scott and even J-Lo! So the budget must have been pretty big and the producers must be confident of still making a profit.The story involves the characters we are familiar from for the previous movies being separated, as the tectonic plates start shifting suddenly. Will they all be reunited? You'll never guess! One part of the gang meets a band of pirates on their travels and this makes it harder for them to reunite with the others. That's about it really.Wanda Sykes has all the best lines as Sid's long lost Granny.",6,0,0,11 July 2012
The Wrestler," Old Fashioned Theme but Very Good
","This film is old fashioned in many ways but nonetheless very enjoyable. How many films have we seen where a down on his luck character does his best to get his live back together by reconciling with family and having a last try for true love? This is the story of 'The Wrestler' in a nutshell but what makes it stand out are the performances of Rourke and Tomei in particular and the uncompromising detail of the wrestling sequences. There is no doubt that Mickey Rourke's real life fall from grace was in my mind as I watched him play Randy The Ram Robinson. You can't help but wonder how much of his own life he sees in the character. Randy realises in the film that the only part of his life that he can be successful in is wrestling. We see how his attempts at family relationships and holding down a job are doomed to failure. He hates being called by his real name, even while working in a deli. In the end he admits that in front of his adoring fans is the only place that he can feel comfortable and happy. He thinks he sees a kindred spirit in exotic dancer Cassidy. She, however, is very careful to separate her 'real life', raising a son, saving to buy a condo, from her life as a performer. She has a rule of no contact with customers outside the bar. She is tempted to break it with Randy but in the end they both realise (at different times) that it won't work. Even an ending that can be seen coming from a long way out doesn't take away from this excellent movie. The wrestling scenes are excellent, getting across the performance aspect of the 'show' as well as the down at heel air of wrestling at a lower level. Recommended viewing.",8,1,1,23 January 2009
Inception," Great idea but does too much detail take from the story?
","First the things about this film I loved: - Brilliant original idea about dream manipulation - Amazing special effects - Great cast and acting ‚Äì especially the gorgeous Marion CotillardHowever there were some things I wasn't so keen about: - Too many characters competing for the viewers attention - Too many details and 'rules' about dreams invasion are thrown at the viewer in a very short space of time. I gave up trying to take it all in after a while - The film is about 30 minutes too long, much of that taken up with boring James Bond type shoot outs and chasesThe story revolves around an expert dream invader (DiCaprio) who is recruited by a businessman to plant an idea into the head of a rival. As he plans the job and recruits his team we learn about his own troubled past. Giving any more details would reveal too much of the plot.I certainly enjoyed this movie. Maybe I would enjoy it even more on a second viewing when my head is not spinning as I try to follow who is who and what is what. However given Nolan's track record with Memento I was a little disappointed that the story seemed to be sacrificed somewhat in order to squeeze in as much detail as possible.",7,1,3,4 August 2010
Sherlock Holmes," Guy Ritchie's Version an enjoyable ride
","Guy Ritchie has directed a Sherlock Holmes film. And it's turned out as you'd expect a Guy Ritchie directed Sherlock Holmes film to be like. Perhaps better than you'd expect.This Holmes is not traditional in any sense. He engages in bare knuckle boxing, has a distinctly Mid Atlantic accent and makes clear his disapproval of Dr. Watson moving out of Baker Street to live with his fianc√©e. The plot is as much action thriller as whodunit with a couple of epic chase sequences that Arthur Conan Doyle must have left out of his books in error.It is a highly enjoyable film though. The plot is suitably far fetched, involving the take over the British government through Black Magic. The cast are excellent. Robert Downey Junior obviously has a ball as a charming and cynical Holmes. Jude Law is nicely understated as the resourceful doctor. Mark Strong is an excellent villain. Rachel McAdams seems a bit young as Irene Adler, who supposedly has a long history with Holmes but I'll forgive her as she lights up the screen in her scenes.So it's not quite Sherlock Holmes for the 'Loaded' generation but it's style is certainly taken more from Ritchie's previous hits like 'Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' than the original stories. Sit back and enjoy the ride and wait for the sequel that is heavily hinted at the end.",7,0,0,10 February 2010
Prometheus," Well made sci-fi movie but no classic
","It is inevitable that this movie is going to be compared to Ridley Scott's Alien, even though they were made more than thirty years apart. Unfortunately and probably inevitably Prometheus falls short of the deserved 'all-time classic' rating that Alien has.Prometheus is very well made. In particular the special effects excellent. However the plot is needlessly complicated and there are too many characters. There are definitely too many annoying scientists who 'have to find out the truth' about man's origins no matter what the consequences.The acting is fine. Michael Fassbender is very good as the efficient yet sinister android David. The action scenes are good but some of the dialogue is dodgy and the end shamelessly prepares the audience for a sequel.So erase all traces of 'Alien' from your mind and you will probably enjoy this movie and then forget it not long after leaving the cinema.",7,3,8,11 July 2012
Despicable Me," Good animation but not an outstanding movie
","'Despicable Me'had the potential be very funny but a weak script stops it from being as funny as it could have been.The animation is excellent, with bold bright colours very prominent all through. Steve Carrell does well as the voice of the anti-hero who has family issues.He plays Gru, a villain who is determined to beat the efforts of his main rival, who has just stolen the Pyramids. For reasons too complicated to explain here his plan involves adopting three small girls. Needless to say living with the girls helps him to get a different perspective on his life.There are a few laugh-out-loud moments (the Minions are pretty funny) and some good action/chase scenes but not enough to keep the audience engaged. I left the cinema thinking that the film could have been a lot better with a more original story",6,1,3,25 November 2010
Toy Story 3," Impossible not to enjoy it
","It's been a while since I watched the other two Toy Story movies so I wasn't expecting much from this one. For the first hour I was thinking that the third instalment was a bit of let down but the last 45 minutes really make up for that.The toys owner, Andy, is going to college and doesn't seem interested in his collection of toys anymore. Most of them end up in a daycare centre for wild kids but with some persuasion by Woody they decide the best thing is to make it back to their old house to be there for Andy is he ever needs them.This is where the movie really gets going, with escapes, near misses and a really bad 'baddy'. The pace of the movie is frenetic at this point but this makes it all the more enjoyable.There is a sentimental but satisfying ending that causes one to reflect on the importance of friendship.As with the other movies the animation is superb. There are some great lines and movie references and the voices are brilliant.Movie fans of all ages will love it.",8,0,0,18 November 2011
La Vie En Rose," Well made but somewhat disappointing
","Edith Piaf's life was so dramatic and tragic that you would think that a French made biopic of her would have to be brilliant. However I was somewhat disappointed with 'La Vie En Rose'. It is a good film but when it is obvious how much work and money has been put into its making the result appears to be less than the sum of it's parts.There are many excellent aspects to the film such as the acting, costumes, set design and make up. Marion Cotillard is brilliant as Piaf from her early twenties to her very aged fifties. Piaf comes across as incredibly talented but self-destructive and incapable of dealing with the trappings of her success. Some critics have said that this isn't an accurate portrait. Cotillard's Oscar win for a non English speaking role was as deserved as it was unexpected. The supporting cast are also excellent. There are some great scenes in the movie. The slightly seedy atmosphere of the Paris music halls where Piaf started performing publicly is very well portrayed. The scene where she hears of the tragic death of her lover Marcel Cerdan is also memorable.At the start of movie a lot of time is given to describing Piaf's very sad upbringing after being abandoned in one way or the other by both her parents. These scenes were touching but melodramatic. I thought they took up too much of the film as the most interesting part of her life was after she started performing. The film switches back and forth in time and this means that we see dramatic episodes from Piaf's life but it isn't always clear why she acted in that way.A film that is worth seeing but I was left with the feeling that it wasn't as satisfying as it could have been.",7,0,1,19 August 2010
Identity," Not what it appears to be

One by one they are killed off in increasingly gory ways by an unknown killer who or may not be one of them. The director gradually reveals what what is really happening and the film turns into something I didn't expect.The excellent cast including John Cusack, Amanda Peet John C.

You are guaranteed numerous smiles and maybe even a few tears.,9,2,7,2 January 2009
Pitch Perfect," Has enough quirky bits to be enjoyable
","'Pitch Perfect' is an enjoyable comedy that will appeal to a wide audience. Anna Kendrick plays Beca, a girl starting college. She wants to go to LA to get involved in the music industry but as her father is a professor at the college she is getting free tuition. Initially she has no interest in mixing as she intends leaving as soon as she can but her father insists that she participate in college life so she joins an all girl 'A Cappella' singing group in the college, because wouldn't you know it, she has a terrific voice.The group came close to winning the National title the previous year but one of its leaders (Anna Camp) had an unfortunate nausea caused event on stage in the final, ruining their chances. Therefore the group's leaders are even more determined to do well this year. However they aren't interested in trying out new styles of performances that Beca suggests. Even more importantly members are not allowed to fraternise with members of the all male group in the college. You can see where this going.There are rehearsals to find new members and a varied bunch of girls (including a black lesbian, and a whispering Asian) is recruited. This part of the movie has some good laughs in it. Of course Beca REALLY likes one of the members of the male group but as she finds herself taking her participation in the group more seriously she decides to avoid temptation by avoiding him.There is nothing very original in the movie but it doesn't take itself too seriously and there are enough quirky characters and dialogue to stop it becoming too bland. The cast also seem to be enjoying themselves. Rebel Wilson has a lot of the best lines as 'Fat Amy'. The singing sequences are good and don't last long enough to bore viewers who aren't 'Glee' fans.Elizabeth Banks is a producer of the movie so I presume it was her own idea to play half of a commentating double act we see at each competition, along with John Michael Higgins. I think they are trying to something similar to what was done to good effect in 'Dodgeball', with Gary Cole and Jason Bateman as the ESPN 8 commentators. However here the lines just aren't funny enough.An undemanding but enjoyable comedy.",6,0,2,15 January 2013
Looper," Entertaining Time travel thriller
","If you don't think about the science too much (as Bruce Willis recommends during the movie) you will probably enjoy Looper as much as I did.It is set in the near future. Further into the future again Time Travel has been invented and is used by criminals there to send people they want to 'dispose of' back in time to be summarily executed by 'Loopers'. Our 'hero' is Joe, a Looper played by Joseph Gordon Levitt. They are well paid for this work but know that is highly likely that they themselves, if they live long enough will be tracked down by their former employers and sent back in time to be killed by their younger selves before they know who their latest victim is, hence closing the 'loop'.Suffice it to say, Joseph Gordon Levitt changes into Bruce Willis as the years go by and is sent back in time. I'm not giving much away by revealing that this particular loop closure doesn't go as planned. Both versions of Joe go on the run from the criminals that wanted him dead. Along the way they cross paths with single mother, Sara and her rather peculiar son, Cid. They have an interesting part to play in the plot also.The movie is a satisfying mix of action, sci-fi and even a bit of romance.",7,1,3,2 January 2013
Easy A," Better than the average High School comedy
","This is an enjoyable comedy marked by excellent performances and a slightly dark take on at the problems of High School life.Emma Stone is an unremarkable student who, by accident, gets the reputation for being a slut (She isn't). In some ways she is glad of the attention and plays along with the reputation. However this only leads to bigger problems.I've liked Stone in films such as 'Zombieland' and 'Superbad' and here again she plays her smart and sarcastic character well so that we have sympathy for her, even though we may not agree with all her decisions. There good performances from Thomas Haden Church and Lisa Kudrow as teachers. However Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson almost steal the show as Stone's laid back parents. It looks like they had a ball playing their parts.A small quibble is the casting of obviously twenty something actors such as Stone and Penn Badgley as High School students.As expected there is a share of hugging and learning towards the end of the film but that is only to be expected in this genre. It is a well-written and acted comedy that doesn't shove its message at the viewer too hard.",7,2,4,19 November 2010
Moon," Slow burning but excellent psychological thriller
","'Moon' isn't really a sci-fi movie at all. It's more a study of humanity that happens to take place in space. At the start of the movie we see Sam (Sam Rockwell) working alone on the dark side of the moon. He is the sole human present, in charge of a mining operation. He is helped by Gerty, a computer voiced by Kevin Spacey.He is coming towards the end of his three-year contract and can't wait to get home to see his wife and child. His loneliness has been worsened due to a problem with communications from Earth to the base, meaning that he can only receive and send recorded video messages. Then he starts seeing mysterious figures inside and outside of the base. It's obvious that all is not as it seems.Revealing any more would give away the plot. Suffice it to say 'Moon' is an excellent slow-burn psychological thriller that has plenty of twists and turns in its ninety minutes. Rockwell is very good as the bewildered worker.Definitely worth a viewing.",7,2,9,7 March 2011
Slumdog Millionaire," Feelgood movie But still packs a few tough punches
","I thoroughly enjoyed this film. It's premise, that the various events in the tough life of a kid from the slums of Mumbai enable him to know all the answers on 'Who wants to be a Millionaire?' is brilliant and Danny Boyle translates this idea to the screen very well.Although overrall this is unashamedly a feelgood movie and the ending is fairly predictable this doesn't mean that it doesn't pack a few tough punches as it depicts life of the poor in India. Boyle has said that once he arrived in India he went the flow and surrendered to the hectic pace of life in Mumbai. This is shown in a number of excellent scenes in the shanty towns of the city.The performances are all excellent particularly from the child actors in the first half of the film and from Amil Kapoor as the quiz show host. I'd definitely recommend this film to anyone.",8,2,4,17 January 2009
The Social Network," Highly entertaining -and you don't have to be on Facebook to enjoy it!
","I really enjoyed this movie. It was written by 'West Wing' creator Aaron Sorkin so don't be surprised that the the plot quickly and an amazing amount happens on screen even though the movie is less than two hours long.Of course Mark Zuckerberg has strongly disputed the truth of what is in the movie. However it is certainly based on indisputable facts. The phenomenon that is Facebook was created by Zuckerberg and some friends at Harvard and subsequently there was a lot of legal wrangling and compensation was paid by the company. However I think most viewers are probably aware that this is the most entertaining possible version of what actually happened.The acting is also top class. Eisenberg nicely underplays it as Zuckerberg. As those around him get upset about various things Zuckerberg gives nothing away and leaves all his 'friends' guessing as to what he really thinks, while getting on with what he is best at - nerdy computery type stuff. Justin Timberlake also impresses as Sean Parker, the one man who seems to be able to influence Zuckerberg.Don't worry. You don't have to be on Facebook or even own a computer to 'get' this movie. Zuckerberg might just as well be called Guttenberg and be inventing the printing press. The movie is about people, what makes them tick, why they pick their friends and discard them and what happens when someone invents something amazingly successful. It deals with a particular type of person - male Harvard undergraduates- but they have the same hang ups (ego, status, petty jealousies between friends, how to succeed with the opposite sex) as we do. Zuckerberg himself realises that Facebook will be more successful the more he understands what people want it to do for them.Zuckerberg is richer than entire nations and there is undoubtedly an element of 'schadenfreude' as we observe that super intelligence and vast wealth doesn't bring him happiness. Not in this version of his life anyway.A funny, sad, self confident movie that is brilliantly written, acted and directed.",Null,0,0,17 September 2011
The Proposal," Yeah, whatever
","When going to romcoms my expectations are usually low. However there are usually a few funny scenes or unusual characters that make you glad you went to see the movie. With The Proposal I'm pretty indifferent about the whole experience. It wasn't unpleasant but there were definitely better things I could have done with those 2 hours of my life. It's hard to put a finger on why I didn't enjoy it. The premise is good. The main stars are fine though there isn't great chemistry apparent. The supporting cast are excellent, especially Betty White. There are a couple of amusing scenes but nothing to make me laugh out loud. The scene with Sandra Bullock dancing in the woods to gangsta rap was the funniest scene. So nothing to make this movie stand out really.",6,0,2,7 September 2009
The Fighter," The fighter and his family
","There have been plenty of movies about professional boxing, both biographical and fictional. The Fighter is a very worthwhile addition to that list. It is based on the life of Micky Ward(Mark Wahlberg), a boxer from Massachusetts. He is a gutsy fighter with some potential but fears he may have missed his chance at the big time. He is trained by his half-brother, Dicky Eklund (Christian Bale), who still tries to live off the fame of knocking down Sugar Ray Leonard over ten years before. His mother (Melissa Leo) manages Ward rather poorly; signing him for fights he cannot win. She is a larger than life figure who treats Eklund as her favourite son. She ignores that Eklund is a drug addict and this is reducing Ward's chance of success. Eventually Eklund's lifestyle causes him to end up in jail.However Ward, an easygoing man, is slow to rock the boat until he starts going out with a local barmaid (Amy Adams). She sees both his potential and the way he is being badly treated by his family. With her support he confronts them and tells them he is getting a new manager. Suffice it to say his mother does not take this too well.The rest of the movie charts Ward's increasing success and what happens when Eklund is released from prison.The performances are generally excellent. Christian Bale has rightly received plaudits for playing Eklund. A youtube search shows that his portrayal of him as a rather annoying non-stop talker is pretty accurate! Wahlberg is highly impressive in the less flashy role of Ward. He accurately portrays his frustration at the way his career is fading as well as his love for his family members who are causing that to happen. I thought Melissa Leo played the mother as an almost cartoonish character and this grated slightly with me. If she is as she comes across in the film in real life she must be impossible to live with! Her brood of daughters are similarly portrayed as being intimidating to say the least.The boxing scenes are shown as if they are appearing on a TV screen and I found this, as well as the excellent fight choreography, made the scenes very authentic",Null,2,3,24 February 2011
