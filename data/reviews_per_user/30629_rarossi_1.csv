Captain Phillips," Based on facts... Loosely based on facts
","This is a pretty good movie, but if you are looking for a documentary of what really happened move along. There is a whole lot of Hollywood taking liberties with the story. Half the crew of the ship is currently in lawsuits with the shipping line because they say the captain put them in danger in his quest to maximize profits. There is no question that this whole saga was a political showcase for the United States and this movie maintains this showcase. It could be used as a recruiting tool. In summary, I found the movie entertaining and interesting, but I was annoyed with how much it veered from the truth. It would be much better if it were more factual.",6,2,3,4 March 2016
