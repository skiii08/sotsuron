Gremlins," Puts You In The Christmas Spirit!
","'Gremlins' seemed to be marketed as a fun family comedy about little muppet - type creatures that invade a small town. I'm sure the parents who brought their kids to see this thought it would be a fun family night out. That's when angry parents started walking out of test screenings... 'Gremlins' features Gremlin blending, Gremlin microwaving, blood, guts, dog hanging by tree lights, weird bubbles on the Gremlin's backs with baby Gremlins hatching in them, fathers getting stuck in the family chimney and dying, a few somewhat grizzly human deaths and, oh, of course, the cutest creature on the Earth... being tortured. Yes, 'Gremlins' is not your average Christmas movie but for the sickest of minds, it's a must see! Mr. Peltzer (Hoyt Axton) is a scientist who creates less than perfect inventions. When away from home, he gets his son Billy (Zach Galligan) an early Christmas present: A cute furry creature named Gizmo (Voice of Howie Mandel) who seems to be the perfect pet but he has three important rules not to break: Don't expose him to bright light or sunlight which would kill him, don't get him wet in which case he would multiply and, most importantly, don't let him eat after midnight or else all hell will break loose. Yes, before we know it, slimy green creatures are invading the cosy town of Kingston Falls with their eyes set on Billy and Gizmo. It's up to Billy to stop the creatures, save the town and get the girl he loves (Phoebe Cates). I remember my sister subjected me to watching Gremlins when I was about 5 and I had nightmares all night but now it's high on my list of favorite films. It has a cast at it's best including Dick Miller and Judge Reinhold, a very dark humoured and mean yet hilarious script by Chris Columbus and expert fantasy directing by Joe Dante which sets you right in the mood from the opening credits then about 30 minutes into the film he throws it all in your film. Yes, 'Gremlins' is an almost flawless film let down by only a few over long sequences (The Gremlin Bar scene starts out great but descends into boredom) but that's all made up for with the hilariously dark Christmas Story from Phoebe Cates about her father's Christmas Eve surprise that didn't turn out as planned. The scene really caused a lot of controversy as did the now infamous kitchen scene which features Gremlins meeting their demise by butcher's knife, blender and, of course, microwave. Ladies and Gentleman, if this happened in 'Wonderful Life', the suicide would have been inevitable. Get ready for a different kind of Christmas movie!!!",Null,0,1,3 January 2003
Meet the Parents," The Best Film of 2000
","I saw this on Christmas Eve of 2000 and it was the perfect start toChristmas. Not only is this one of the best scripts of the lastdecade, but it contains brilliant directing by Jay Roach(AustinPowers 1, 2 and 3) and excellent acting performances by BenStiller(There's Something About Mary, Zoolander) and Robert DeNiro(The Godfather 2, The Untouchables). The film follows GregFocker(Ben Stiller), a male nurse who wants to propose to hisgirlfriend Pam(Teri Pole) but finds out that he needs to meet herfather(Robert DeNiro) and ask for his permission beforeproposing. That's when everything starts to go wrong... One of thethings that's brilliant about this film is that it takes a real-lifeconcept(Meeting your future In-Laws for the first time) andmultiplies it by ten. The father is a former CIA guy who is spying onyou at any moment which is enough for anyone but then theydiscover the last name(Focker), the middle name(Gay-Lord) andyou also happen to be a clumsy fool.I can safely say that'll neverregret seeing Meet the Parents and i'm highly excited to see theupcoming 'Meet the Fockers'(Written by Chris and Paul Weitz,directors of American Pie and About A Boy)",Null,0,0,10 May 2002
The Evil Dead," The Ultimate Horror Movie
","Released twenty years ago, 'The Evil Dead' is still a film that holdsup today. An unusual mix of grim horror and laugh out loud blackcomedy, this first film of a trilogy has got more cult followers thanyou could imagine. Girls, women, men, boys and children flock tosee this movie. While some moments aren't as shockingly originalas they were back then, most of it is still scary and holds up well.The film opens with our hopeless hero Ash, his girlfriend Linda,his sister Cheryl and their friends Scott and Shelly heading off to adeserted cabin in the woods supposedely for a weekend of funand games. However, what starts off as fun turns into terror withthe discovery of the 'Book of the Dead' in the cellar and the treerape attack of Cheryl (an amazing scene, by the way). With hisfriends possessed, all Ash can do is kill them without mercybeforeb he becomes the evil dead's next victim. Many people overthe years have complained about the violence but upon watching ittoday, it seems surprisingly tame for an 80's horror picture. Andyes, I AM watching the UNCUT version. To me it doesn't seem asshocking as it would have been twenty years ago. Bruce Campbellis genius in his role as Ash. In this film, he plays Ash as a witty,intelligent, good looking college student who likes to hang aroundwith his pals but in the next two, he would be a bumbling idiot whogets hit on the head a lot. Here, Ash is a normal guy who findshimself surrounded by dead incarnations of his friends and thereis a great look on his face around the middle of the film that saysperfectly 'I'm all alone and surrounded by the living dead'. A lot ofthese character traits are thanks to Sam Raimi, writer and director,who has wrote a genius script and directed it like a pro. He's evencreated his own type of shot! For me, 'Evil Dead' is my least favoriteof the 'Evil Dead' trilogy with 'Army of Darkness' being my favoritebut that doesn't mean to say it's a bad film. It's a grim, disturbing,humorous and violent look into the ultimate holiday gone wrong.An absolute must see!",Null,0,1,20 January 2003

First time i sawit at Xmas, i actually skipped the whole last part of the moviebecause i thought it was too boring but when i revisited it lately, it'squite a good film. It's hardly as funny as people say, i didn't evenchuckle at the 'This one goes to 11' scene but the movie is still agood film which makes for a good fun viewing on a boring day.",Null,0,1,23 May 2002
Reservoir Dogs," The Best Film of the Early Nineties
","Some time, probably around 1990, young video store clerk Quentin Tarantino had his third screenplay noticed by big-shot Harvey Keitel who subsequently gave him money to make the film and even starred in it. The result was this masterpiece of modern filmmaking. Gangster Joe Cabot(the late, great Lawrence Tierney) and his son Nice Guy Eddie(Chris Penn) are planning a diamond heist in downtown LA. They recruit a team of criminals who work under code names: Mr. White(Harvey Keitel), Mr. Blonde(Michael Madsen), Mr. Pink(Steve Buscemi), Mr. Blue(Eddie Bunker, a real life criminal), Mr. Brown(Writer/Director Quentin Tarantino) and Mr. Orange(Tim Roth) but the heist goes wrong and the gang end up dead, wounded or some of them managed to escape. Back at their central, an abonded warehouse(Filled with coffins, if you look close enough), they try to figure out what went wrong and who the undercover cop in their gang is through a series of flashbacks.This is a film that you either love or hate. Some people love it and some people hate this film, Quentin Tarantino and especialy Pulp Fiction with a vengeance. The people who like it, though, have to agree that it's one of the most brilliant and smart movies of the nineties. Funny, violent, and complicated(But not as complicated as Tarantino's second film, Pulp Fiction), Reservoir Dogs gives the viewer the best glimpse since the film noirs of the fifties, into the criminal underworld. After seeing this film, a lot of things will stick for a while. You will never forget Mr. Brown's definition of 'Like a Virgin, Mr. Pink's thoughts on waitresses or the stylish violence that comes with it. The performances are something that can't be missed either. You won't be forgetting Harvey Keitel's hard, yet sensitive, criminal or Steve Buscemi neurotically babbling on about the cops or Tim Roth bleeding to death on the floor for most of the film. The real stand-out performance of the film is Michael Madsen as crazy cop killer Mr. Blonde. I would also like to take this moment to comment on the 'infamous torture scene': It's not that big as it's cracked up to be. It mostly takes place off camera and you only see the aftermath which didn't disturb me at all. The upcoming special feature packed tenth anniversary DVD promises two alternate angles(One is a close-up) so we might see more violence out of that scene too. Back to actors, i was dissapointed that Eddie Bunker, who plays Mr. Blue, didn't get much screen time. In fact, playing the movie over in my head, i can't remember him saying one line. I would have loved to hear some of his redneck rambling. Another excellent feature of this film is the radio which blares in the background duriing the film with the 'Super Sounds of the Seventies Weekend'. You're bound to get one song in there that you love and it especially adds to the atmosphere of the film. Overall, this film may not be as brilliant or as long as Pulp Fiction but it's a very brilliant first film by a very brilliant first director. 8/10. Don't forget, Tarantino's next movie, 'Kill Bill' is coming out next year.",Null,0,1,1 July 2002
Halloween," Halloween: The Ultimate Terror Film Creation
","Today, some may look down on it as a horrible slasher film piece of shlock made in the seventies oozing with teenage sex and violence. They couldn't be more wrong. 'Halloween' (1978) did begin countless slasher films dripping with countless teenage sex scenes and even more violent scenes involving horrible dialogue with one dimensional cardboard cut out stock characters. In every slasher film, it was the same: The big breasted bimbo, the jock, the joker, the stoned out character, the easy-to-kill black character the obvious virginal heroine and her suave sophistichated boyfriend (Although not all had one) who would also be killed off quick. The original thing about this film is that it had all these characters before they became the norm. Back then, it was truly suspensful. Of course, 'Halloween' still rises above the imitators either way, mainly because this one is a truly scary piece of psychological terror that gets even better with multiple viewings, as I discovered recently when I bought it in the 'Halloween: Ultimate Collection' DVD box set. The film begins with a different kind of opening credits. It features an evil, smiling pumpkin which the camera closes up to as the ever so memorable 'Halloween' theme tune runs on. After these credits quickly finish, we find ourselves in the POV of an unkown character outside a house. It's 1963 and we move around the house, eventually killing a young girl called Judith Myers who screams 'Michael!' at us. At the end of this long shot the mask is pulled off us by Michael Myer's parents. Michael is 6 years old and has just killed his sister. Cut to 15 years later, Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) is travelling to MIchael Myer's trial with his assistant Marion (Nancy Stephens) when Michael breaks out of his asylum and steals their car. His mission is to travel to his hometown of Haddonfield to kill a small town babysitter Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis, in her first role). The story is simple, I could give more plot points and character names but there is no point to that. The plot and characters are simple. 'Halloween' is meant as a very scary piece of fun and it succeeds on those counts. It's harmless fun yet it will have you jumping miles out of your seat but director John Carpenter does not rely on jump scares all the time. Most of the time, he builds suspense usually with his own haunting score. The film will have you on the edge of your seat more times than jumping out of it. The film's killer, Michael Myers' walks around slowly and patiently wearing a chalk white human face mask with sticky out hair. Michael is a one of a kind villain. Expertly written by Carpenter and Debra Hill and directed by Carpenter, his stalking scenes go up there with famous scenes like the shower scene in 'Psycho' or the any part of 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'. But the person you have to thank most for those scares is Michael Myers himself, Nick Castle. An all-round nice guy who was cast as the killer because Carpenter saw a 'dark side', Castle manages to play Michael in the right frame of mind with the right mood, building some of the best scares in the movies. It is he you have to truly thank for the role. For people who may not know this, an interesting fact is that during the unmasking scene of Michael, it is not Castle's face behind the mask but that of Tony Moran. The rest of the cast also deserve some sort of medal for their roles. Jamie Lee Curtis, Nancy Loomis and PJ Soles are all excellent as the trio of giggling girls. Donald Pleasance is absolutely brilliant (and completely essential) in his role as Sam Loomis, he really excells in the role. A nice thing to see. Charles Cyphers is pretty impressive in his role as the disbelieving sherrif of Haddonfield, not happy that Loomis is spreading his small happy town with horrible rumours. The camerawork and overall style of the movie is nicely done by Carpenter and makes it essential for repeat viewings, so you can see stuff you missed. I could rave on and on about this movie but I'll finish up by saying that 'Halloween' is essential viewing. It is the father of all horror films and Myers is the father of all serial killers. Go see it.",Null,0,0,14 November 2002
Evil Dead II," The Sequel to The Ultimate Experience in Grueling Terror
","Horror sequels aren't always what you want them to be. Mostly,they are just in need of desperate cash so the idea of a sequelcomes to them but with Evil Dead 2, they made a difference... 'TheEvil Dead' was a dark, disturbing and plain horrific horror moviethat had you jumping out of your seat but 'Evil Dead 2: Dead byDawn' is a hilarious comedy. Funny, weird and 'Groovy'! This filmhas it all: A man mutilating himself (funny, of course), swallowedeyeballs, A severed hand killing people (the inspiration for 1999's'Idle Hands') and, of course, a decapitated dancing corpse. Yes,it's a horror movie with a difference alright and while some fans ofthe original 'Evil Dead' will be dissapointed that this is less horror,more looney tunes, others will be delighted at this film's strangeand original premise: Of taking the original film and totally flippingit on it's head, simaliar to what 'Gremlins 2' did a few years later.Unlike that film however, this film picks up right where the originalleft off right at the very second. Ash, after a long demon filled night,is once again attacked by the evil force in the morning and fallsunconscious. Later on when he wakes up, it is almost night andthe horror is starting again. This time, the evil is almost mockinghim to the point where they possess his hand and start killing himwith it. But Ash is soon to be joined by four others, who are alsoseemingly doomed mainly by the strange demon down in thecellar by the name of Henrietta. It's up to Ash to kick some demonbutt. For me, 'Evil Dead 2' just improves on the original but isn'tanywhere near as good as 'Army of Darkness'. Still, the film isentertaining right up to the twist ending and for many this is theultimate in horror comedy. A film that has spawned endlesscopycats, some excellent and some just doing it for cash, 'EvilDead2' is THE original.",Null,0,0,20 January 2003
