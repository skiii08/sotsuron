Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Good film but missing a little bit of atmosphere.
","I watched this film yesterday after a great deal of expectation and found myself laughing at a lot of the jokes because I felt I had to. I was slightly disappointed and the film just seemed a bit of an extension to an existing formula. A bit of slapstick and a bit of humour and several embarrassing situations for Borat and the people who he involves in his visit to the 'U S and A!' I felt that the cause of this was probably because I had this expectation from watching the trailers and seeing Borat on TV a lot it would be a film that I would be constantly laughing as many of the reviews stated.However, this was not the case for me. It was a quiet cinema which lacked a lot of atmosphere, so it might have to do with the people you watch the film with. But overall I expected a bit more from the film.I would recommend that people go and watch this film, as it may just be the case that it is dependent on your mood and of those people around you!",6,0,3,7 November 2006
