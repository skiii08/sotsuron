Blade Runner 2049," Boring and pretentious
",This is another sequel that is a waste of time and lacks good editing. I'm assuming that the director is trying to build mood by not moving the story forward very quickly but the characters lack depth so the effort is wasted. Each character's motivation is not well explained so the conclusion makes very little sense. As other reviewers have indicated this is another example of a movie that is ridiculously overrated on IMDb so the only reviews I read now are the ones that hate a movie because at least they seem to be honest.,1,9,17,15 October 2017
