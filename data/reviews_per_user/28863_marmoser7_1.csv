The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Teenage Melodrama with Little Substance
",Very shallow and trivialized storyline with no depth to the acting. The pace was slow and the content thin. Moviegoers are tired of being gouged by greedy studios. The splitting of the movie into 2 parts with a 1 year intermission just does not work well. The split ending was very abrupt as well with no real incentivized cliff-hanger. In my opinion one of the worst teenage disasters of 2014 by far. Shameful character development and a huge waste of money and manpower. Many will be disappointed with this poor effort at depicting what could have been a great story and potentially captivated audiences. My friend woke me up twice and caught me snoring in the middle.... Hunger Shames :(,3,26,39,22 November 2014
