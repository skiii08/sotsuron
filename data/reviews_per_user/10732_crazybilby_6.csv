Sucker Punch," Visual masterpiece but intellectually lacking
","It started off with an incredible stylistic opening that was a feast for the eyes. Zack Snyder was busy showing him being brilliant visually and dramatically. Ah that was a great opening scene...Then there's a little bit of plot and then BAM! Time for some quick hallucinating a whole new world. We're introduced to our pretty uninteresting and simple characters, none of which have any depth to them. What they do have is massive sex appeal, which distracted me momentarily for a while as I patiently waited for the plot to happen.Though eventually oggling Emily Browning was insufficient for my film student self to passively enjoy the film. No, it just kept going. Action sequences were broken up with the calmer scenes. The pretense was really just an excuse to have completely unrealistic violence in various artist landscapes. The problem was that there wasn't much of a challenge, or progression in plot... it was 'I need to do something. Cue fight scene. Fight scene means something is achieved. Dialogue saying we need to do another thing. Cue bizarre fight scene.' Where's the challenges? Where's the progression? Things just happen... because.Though there was a little bit of an attempt to give depth to Sweet Pea and Rocket by giving them a little bit of a backstory which then FINALLY became a bit of a center for the 'plot' to revolve around besides Baby doll.It was a steady downhill descent into mindless pointless plot less violence. I started off being wowed by it, then got bored, then it brought it back to the plot at the end (almost as if there wasn't any gap between the start and the end, like the middle and all the violence was pointless filler - which it was) and I thought that was good... Then the absolute end attempted to be some kind of trippy mind-messing twist which came off poorly.It is the worst Zack Snyder film I have ever seen, mindless drivel. though not without some redemption. It was a very stylistically well done mindless drivel.",Null,0,3,28 April 2011
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," So BAD I find it funny
","I've read all the books. I know what happens. This never ruins a film for me.I didn't want to see this film because the previous one was lacking in... well... everything. But girlfriend wanted to see it. I went in and was instantly surprised to see the demographic had widened past 12-16 year old girls who instantly swoon at any even remotely hot guy so that was interesting. It's not relevant to how good the film was- it just reaffirmed to me (and should to all of you) that hating a series on principle or having preconceived notions of how bad something will be is unfair on it.Not in this case. It was still bad. BUT worth the money I payed to see it because though it most definitely not intended to be entertaining in the way I found it. It was full of melodramatic dialogue and bad acting which, if you take ANY Drama classes at school- Which Robert DIDN'T- you'll notice certain things about how people deliver lines. You notice how they're SAYING lines they have memorised with unnatural and stylised emphasis on the key words in the sentences without giving the (cheesy) dialogue depth or realism. Quite simply, it was so terrible I found myself resisting the urge to burst out laughing in a room full of fans who were probably misinterpreting the melodrama as 'Good, emotional drama.' No. This film is ridiculous.As it goes further on it gets less tightly stitched together and I had to become reliant on my knowledge of the books to fill in and pick up the slight gaps in dialogue and plot. They would say things that are based on something that didn't happen on screen (probably deleted scene for time) or their dialogue would just be terrible unrealistic lines that are work as standalone ones for a trailer but in conversation it seems like they're jumping slightly just to get to say something that is dramatic without it actually making too much sense.BUT! It does have SOME redeeming qualities! The melodrama wasn't nonstop hilarity so thankfully something else held my attention. There was actual effort put into this film. The fight scenes actually used REAL special effects (something the first film was a bit cheap on) which actually looked kinda impressive. Any action was short lived unfortunately but what little there was, they did a reasonable job with.I was impressed at the presence of transition. The previous film jumped and skipped and the next plot point just WAS without having been caused. This film (until near the end, of course) actually had a pace and a coherency to it that allows you to understand it without reading the books. This is a bonus. Certain things you'd think would drag on as the director tries to give you time to let the 'emotion' 'sink in' thankfully didn't take forever and the entire movie fit almost snuggly into its 2 hour length. Too bad it fell apart more and more it went along.The film also shares the semi-awkward character interactions that create the same humour as the first one. Not as deliberately funny as the first one (though, as I said, it was pretty hilarious when it wasn't meant to be) though.Though it was many failings with only a few things to back it up as being a reasonable film it will definitely make all you little teenage girls out there desperate to see Jacob's hell tanked up body very happy. You can HEAR the audience's reaction the first time Jacob takes his shirt off. He's got all you need: Pecs, biceps, ABS OF STEEL and minimal clothing. Too bad he lacks depth and real character. (Girls love obsessively devoted Zombies, they don't think enough to complain) It is NO WAY even NEAR one of the best films of 2009. NO ONE should say this ridiculous claim.Really tossing up between 3 and 4 stars. Mmm. I guess a movie's highlight shouldn't be how low it sinks. 3.",3,1016,1554,19 November 2009
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," One of the Best Star Wars Films - EVER.
","The hate this movie gets for not being like Star Wars or doing disappointing things with its leads is misguided desire for depthless action. The criticism that this isn't a Star Wars movie is a willing denial of what Star Wars has embodied for the past 40 years.This movie takes a lot of elements of the other two trilogies are spins them together into what isn't just a visually stunning sequence of action/adventure but a deeply nuanced look at grief, loss, and desire - all central themes we've seen explored to varying degrees before. We all see that Kylo is a more nuanced version of how Anakin SHOULD have been. We can see the struggle and conflict within him far more realistically and nuanced than Anakin's whingey emo tantrums and that's expanded so well in this movie. Kylo and Rey's conflict goes into shades of grey instead of polar black and white like the prequels.Now I've seen a lot of issues with how Luke is portrayed. When we last see him in the end of The Force Awakens he's banished himself to an island to mope and be hidden from everyone. You may have heard the criticism that his character is misused, not interesting enough, blah blah blah. No. That's like if you watched Star Wars in numerical order, got really impressed by Yoda's badass lightsaber flips in 2 and 3 then in 5 and 6 when we see him again you revolt at this swamp frog that makes jokes and doesn't do anything interesting (though without getting into detail: Luke is actually shown as being very powerful so where's the issue?). When we see Obi Wan in #4 he seems to be relatively unhaunted by how he went against the will of the jedi and demanded to train Anakin, thus leading to the downfall of the jedi. Yet he's banished himself. Yoda and Obi are Luke's rolemodels. What were people expecting? We find out more about why Luke has banished himself and it's haunting. It's terrifying and saddening. It's more realistically tormented than Obi Wan. We see angst and loss in a far more real and nuanced way than we've ever seen in the previous shoot-em-up action of the previous Star Wars.And then there's more. This movie is brilliantly introspective. It takes a critical eye to the universe it exists in and the tropes it has contributed to in the genre and popular culture at large. The director hasn't only taken all the themes of Star Wars and revisited them in more depth, but he's put Star Wars under a microscope and demanded to know what makes it tick. What do we expect? Perhaps the criticism is that it turns a few tropes on its head. But that's good! We got annoyed that TFA was too much of a rehash of A New Hope. This movie still retains a lot of what we know and love about Star Wars but mixes around the pieces, plays around with the jigsaw puzzle of audience expectation, and creates a fluid yet coherent series of surprises, trope reversals, and important character growth for all of our central characters. We break down the sexism of male heroism (a reason for misogynistic fan boys to hate it but not a real fan), we break down the illusion of a distinct black and white world of morality, and it's just amazing. I love it. I love how it challenges the form yet is still familiar enough to not feel completely different. It what was Star Wars needs to be to survive a new generation of viewers with new codes and social contexts.Now let's talk about action. Oh boy. Can I pin down my favourite action sequence? No. Not even close. This is perhaps the most visually stunning Star Wars I've ever seen. No. It definitely is. From (redacted) to (redacted) to (redacted) you'll have rewarding after rewarding moment of either just plain epic action to a deeply satisfying conclusion to a metaphor about good vs evil. If you have seen it you'll understand.Admittedly there are a flew flaws in this movie but rarely do we get a perfect movie. Still, it's such a thrilling movie I cannot help but give it 9 out of 10. Hot damn! This movie will be one that our children will watch over and over. It's finally a trilogy for a new generation to grow up watching and fall in love with. And that's the most important thing to me. It proves that Star Wars is for everyone.So see it again and again and again until every layer rubs off onto you and you can fully appreciate its brilliant.",9,1,2,14 January 2018
Paranormal Activity," Freaky
","I don't really believe that it counts as this generations 'The Exorcist' but that doesn't matter, it's still quite good. It's not a series of screeching heads popping up to get cheap shocks out of the audience. The audience is in the dark and the screen is dark. You sit, and wait, and wonder what's going to happen next, and sometimes it's just really bizarre. It was incredibly suspenseful and the pauses are larger than some other movies which would've made it boring if it didn't capture your attention so simply and effectively. At first it seems like the entity is a serious lightweight with such spooky tricks as moving someones keys to the middle of the room at night and only making one thing go thud in the night but it manages to escalate to the point where it's not so subtle, but not so grand and amazing, but still really freaky. It's pretty clever n that respect and just goes to prove that budget isn't needed to make a film good.When Katie screeches it's really kind chilling. It's not got the whole generic teenager in slasher film sort of screaming. It was awfully chilling and freaky. As for Mika, he was an idiot. He was an absolute idiot who kept saying that he could handle it, he was in control and that he was making progress when really he just made things a lot worse. Thankfully his tool-like nature was not so extreme to be apparent instantly or ruin the movie.The relationship breakdown between the two as the movie progresses was very realistic and that part of the story was actually filmed more believably than in Cloverfield. In Cloverfield the 'OMG A MONSTER LETS FILM IT!' aspect made sense but the 'hey just ignore the camera I'm holding to the side as I film your reactions to me flirting with you' was just there because it needed to be for the story. The bits between the nights when it's filmed are realistic. It's believable that Mika would film some of it because it doesn't appear to be propped up as a reality TV show.So it's pretty freaky. It didn't leave me cautious to open doors or make me a little tense as I turned the lights off and went to sleep but it certainly spooked me while I was watching it. The person next to me was covering their eyes and freaking out though!",7,1,6,29 December 2009
Alice in Wonderland," Not a Disappointment Burton's Best or most Imaginative
","I liked the character of Alice. She was a very interesting character and did really seem more like Alice when watching the film than she did when viewing the trailer. The red Queen also seemed very much queen like.Other characters felt either empty or not as interesting or right to me. Something about the Cheshire cat just didn't seem quite right, and it was weird as they all ended up having names. Also, characters (such as the white queen) seem to appear to have some form of personality, but just don't seem real or full which wouldn't be a problem if it was the original story of Alice in Wonderland but Burton tries to turn everyone into more believable characters and it didn't work too well in some cases. Not a total disaster, the Mad Hatter turned into more than just a raving lunatic obsessed with tea.Burton almost seems to give a sense of order and logic to wonderland. It's weird seeing a Tim Burton film that seems to be trying to be NORMAL instead of weird! Wonderland becomes a linear and ordered place where you can go from one spot to another with no trouble of things changing dramatically or getting lost if you turn around. It lacks the imagination and surrealist absurdity of Alice in Wonderland that it should. It starts off the same as the original and then diverges quite drastically.But it's not a failure of a film. It still had an interesting plot, a few laughs and some imagination. It's still entertaining to watch and visually was quite vivid and interesting. The CGI was not groundbreaking, but it had style. I liked the specific look that they went for and it didn't look camp or unrealistic (well yes, unrealistic as it's wonderland, but you don't go 'that's just stupid'). The ending was happy. It was good. But Burton really didn't hit the mark on this one like his previous films.",6,2,4,3 April 2010
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," What you would expect
","Unlike the first movie, this one takes very little time to establish the plot over time. It gets into the fighting very quickly, and it's exciting and there's all these explosions that we of course paid to see. The problem is that it fails to pace itself or work on anything more than minor plot points (most of which don't make sense, seriously ghost robots?) to progress to the next fight and eventually it becomes tedious having little change. It can't rise and have a dramatic climax because the entire film is one long sequence of action and so it's overall effect is diminished.Watch it if you feel like switching your brain off for over 2 hours so you can get past the uninteresting characters and plot. It really is as you would expect: constant robot fights.",4,0,7,27 February 2011
