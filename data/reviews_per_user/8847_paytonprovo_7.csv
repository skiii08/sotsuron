The Ring," What is with this garbage, not even scary
","I can't even fathom how dumb this is. I read reviews on here and thought it would be good if other people say it is. They made a second one? Oh please I don't want it even in my brain. I got the movie for 2 dollars so I got lucky there but it is still awful. The horrible plot is about a video tape, that if you watch you end up dying 7 days later. I don't even know why the movie is even called The Ring. I don't know what the ring has anything about it. The movie isn't even scary. There is one good pop-up and that is at the start of the movie when the girls face turn ugly but that wasn't even scary for me. Then they do stupid investigation stuff and I end up getting bored and pull out my computer. Then they get to this island and find the well this dead girl (that the movie is about) and the main character goes down the well and thinks she solved it. I thought OMG,is this the end to this madness. Unfortunately it wasn't, I kinda was happy that the possessed girl or whatever she is killed the guy because I thought hay maybe this isn't a complete bust. Then 5 minutes later the movie ends with nothing answered and nothing explained. This movie is terrible and I recommend that nobody sees it.",1,0,2,23 April 2012
21 Jump Street," Very Funny
","21 Jump Street is the funniest movie since Bridemaids and I recommend it to anybody besides little kids because this is a rated R movie. It is so funny and found myself laughing without me realizing I'm laughing. Jonah Hill is funny as always and lost weight, I respect that. Channing Tatum was a good a comedy guy and this is the first comedy I have seen him in. Not was the movie really funny, the story was good and made sense. There was action too. All I'm going to tell is that Jonah and Channing are young cops that screw up and become part of a special group of young cops who go undercover in high school for drug busts and things of that nature. Ice cube is the leader of this group and is very funny and is a good supporting role. This movie is funny and I don't know why some people do not and will not like this movie. It's fun for everyone.",9,0,3,23 April 2012
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Fenominal
","Where do I start, the movie was amazing. Daniel Craig was great and Rooney Mara put on one of the best performances I've seen in a while. The plot was great, David Fincher is my favorite directors. There were many subplots that made the characters what they were and who they were. It definitely was a detective movie that showed how they found information. I think that how they had the family made a comical touch. I believe this is a best motion picture and it should win. There was good suspense and action and I love the part where the serial killer is revealed. I'm not going to spoil the movie for anyone because this is worth going to the movies and then buying it on DVD. I want to see David Fincher make the other 2 movies because this was fenominal.",7,2,6,15 January 2012
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Good plot, characters, action and everything else.
","Today I went to see Mission Impossible in theaters. I wasn't expecting nothing more than a terrorist threatening the world plot. That's what I got, but the thing is that it is a good plot. Ethan Hunt(Cruise) is back in action with a whole new team(Renner, Pegg, Patton)and a new terrorist with a bomb. I loved the creativity of the weapons and items that were used in the movie. There was technology from the older movies and new technology in this one. There definitely was a lot of good comedy lines and phrases. At times I forgot it was Mission Impossible, it had a different feel from the other ones. I thought it was a good enough add on to the series and hopefully they make more in the future.",8,2,5,22 December 2011
28 Days Later...," History In the Making
","Now when their is a good movie people say it is good and more people see it. I hope by the end of time(2012,JK), everybody has seen this movie. This is by far the best zombie movie in the world and maybe of all time, besides George Romero's Night of the Living Dead. This movie is a British movie that is very scary and is very real. I thought that this could actually happen. The acting is phenomenal and the music is the best music I've heard in a movie. Like the start when Jim(Cillian Murphy),who did his best acting in his career in my opinion,wakes up in the hospital and walks in the streets of London alone.The music starts slow and then goes fast and at the end when Jim is fighting the soldiers. The zombies are scary and fast and I love how you have around 10 seconds until you turn into a zombie. This a very good scary zombie that any zombie horror fan would love.",10,1,3,23 April 2012
The Dark Knight," A true masterpiece
","When I went to theater expecting something similar to Batman Begins, an average good all around action movie. What I got from the Dark Knight is a perfect beautiful masterpiece with very little flaws if any. Heath ledger is a master at his role. He is the best villain in any movie I have ever seen. It is a shame he died because he is a very good actor. Christain Bale had another good performance and the rest of the cast had great showings. The plot was great and I have to say that Heath ledger is a great great joker and no one can match him. Heath ledger is another new edition to the cast and is a good prosecutor. Batman learns more about himself fighting joker then he ever imagined.",10,1,2,20 July 2012
Prometheus," A great movie with a few adaptable weak points
","Prometheus is a great sci-fi movie, not an action or horror movie. Going in to it I thought it would be a horror movie like alien, but it is not. I also thought it would be a prequel which in a way it was, but it was also its own movie. Like some examples of it being a prequel is at the end, they Show how the xenomorphs or 'aliens' (as they were called in the alien movies) were created. Also the ship in the original Alien movie was rounded like the alien ships in Prometheus, and there is an alien in that ship that has its stomach exploded. That alien is the same as the engineer aliens in Prometheus. The crew is the dumbest crew I have ever seen in a movie, at one point they open the ship to a crew member who has been missing . The guy comes in and kills 3 guys and then the crew members kill him. That was a pointless action scene. Afterwards the crew doesn't even talk about it. Stuff like that happens but that still doesn't stop the movie from being great. I think the morale of the story is that the scientist did not find there answers, so we didn't get our answers. What I mean is that a lot of the story was not explained about the engineer aliens because the scientist did not find out a lot about them. All in all this is a great sci-fi movie and I recommend it to sci-fi fans and fans a of the alien movies.",3,5,12,10 June 2012
