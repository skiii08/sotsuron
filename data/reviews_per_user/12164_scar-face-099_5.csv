Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Borat is a nice, I LIKE!
","OK, so Sacha Bara Cohen's Borat came from the small show, 'DA ALI GI SHOW.' Lets just say that this movie was so funny. It has Pamela Anderson in a cameo, has Borat come and make havoc in America, and gives us a good Mr.Bean type comedy movie. I loved it. I couldn't stop laughing at his antics. Some were visually disturbing and some were hilarious to see. I really liked how he learned how to drive a car. This was the best comedy film of the year. No doubt about it. I hope there will be a sequel. Sacha is our generations Rowan Atkinson. If only they cut out that 'hotel' scene. I won't talk about that now. It will just creep people out.",10,1,11,8 March 2007
Zodiac," ZODIAC will be the thriller of the year...!
","First of all, Jake Gyllenhall has picked an excellent film to start this year. ZODIAC is based on the events in the 70's. The killer was named, 'ZODIAC.' NO REALLY! But what he did had astonished the nation. More than 20 murders,and the mysterious corruption's he sent. It is quite scary to see the events. Besides, the guy wasn't caught by the police. Maybe he's still out there. Jake's character is supposed to be the only person who knew the identity of the killer. Then why don't you tell the world who it is. Then you can put that case to rest. This is a film to watch out. It's other stars Robert Downey Jr., Mark Ruffalo and Anthony Edwards. This film comes to theatres on MARCH 2nd.",10,4,12,28 February 2007
I Am Legend," I AM LEGEND is 2007's best film!
","First of all, to the IMDb public, this film is the number 1 movie of 2007. Will Smith has no other big star along side him in this movie. This movie has a running time of 100 minutes (pretty short for a Smith film). But by the end of the film, you just can't believe! First of all (SPOILER ALERT!!!!!) the lady comes to a safe zone in Vermont!! Why didn't these people listen to Smith's character Neville's outcry on FM transmissions!! Second, how can they just end the movie like that! It was such an excellent movie, how could you just end it with the line 'light the darkness!!' But this film is great after all. Smith does an excellent job as the 'last man' on earth. This is the reason the movie is this good! The direction by Francis Lawrence is amazing! He's showing signs of Spielberg and Jackson special effects wizardry! He makes the New York City look so empty, and that is really hard to do, because I have been to NYC and it ain't empty! Akiva Goldsman should of made a better ending, but otherwise great story. This would of been a horrible film if Arnold Schwarzzeneger and Ridley Scott had actually to the film seriously.10/10 best film of 2007!",10,1,6,21 December 2007
World Trade Center," World Trade Center is the best Sept. 11 film in history.
","In the day of Sept. 11, Oliver Stone could be the only director who could display such an astonishing film. No one else could direct a film at this magnitude. If you have not seen this film, go see it. You have to. New York City will never be the same. Or go watch Untied 93. But I recommend WTC. It is so better than Greengrass'es United 93. I liked it. Probably you would to. No one has said to me, yet, that this film was super horrible, or a piece of trash. But no one has told me it was bad either. Even Steven Spielberg would do a terrible job at directing a film like this. Trust me, this is Oliver Stone at his best, or to quite a few, his worst.",10,2,5,17 December 2006
The Hangover Part II," More disgusting, but still worth the watch
","Spoilers ahead...OK folks just to warn u befo u go watch this movie, dun go in thinking that it will be just almost clean comedy. Nope. This movies takes it another level, which is pretty much necessary in terms of keeping the movie funny. Part 2 is actually quite funny, and if u go in thinking this is gonna be some all time classic u must be kidding. The first part is by far one of the best comedies in recent history. This sequel also shows that comedies could have good sequels as well. Though I was quite scared at the beginning where almost the whole opening sequence was shot by shot so similar, after those opening credits were finished, the movie just got better and better.So for anyone who just keeps whining that this movie is similar in total to the first, just keep in my mind this film IS different. I repeat, different. It has some running gags that I think could help it go for a 3rd movie, but I highly doubt a third, even with the huge numbers it took in the box office. But yes, the WOLFPACK IS BACK, and they take us to Bangkok which, when you see this movie, it literally takes the name of the city a bit to far:|",10,3,8,29 May 2011
