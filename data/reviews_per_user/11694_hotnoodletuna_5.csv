Requiem for a Dream," pure genius
","This is undoubtedly one of the finest films of the year.  Aranofsky has managed to make a film even more technically interesting than 'Pi', guaranteeing that he is ad industry force to be reckoned with.  Ellen Burstyn's heart wrenching performance is her finest since 'Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore'.  That she was denied the Oscar is a travesty.Sure the film is thematically a 'Just say no' cautionary fable, but the editing and pacing fill this film with a life and vitality that belies the simplicity of the narrative.  The performances are brilliant, particularly Leto and Burstyn (The mother/ son dynamic between them is just heartwrenching) and Marlon Wayans proves that he has dramatic range as an actor.  This is not a film for the squeamish or the generic 'Scary Movie' crowd, but if you're prepared t be challenged and engaged by the films you watch, this is one of the finest films in recent years",10,0,1,3 December 2001
The Godfather: Part II," best film ever made
","this is the finest film ever made.  The Shakespearian elements of the family tragedy are beautifully portrayed.  The juxtaposition of De Niro's Vito to Pacino's Michael is wonderful, and the scene the young Vito Corleone sitting on the bed at Ellis Island alone is perhaps the most moving single image in film history.",10,0,1,5 March 2002
A Clockwork Orange," Sheer brilliance in cinema
","Stanley Kubrick explores both the nature of the artist as well as the society that he inhabits in this demented and fascinating film.  For, Alex is not simply a hoodlum, he is an artist that works in the medium of pain. Kubrick's film examines the sanitization of his art through societal impositions upon it.Kubrick's masterstroke is to shoot the actions of Alex and his 'droogs' without any sort of object removed moralizing whatsoever.  The actions are simply depicted, and it is the viewer who must process the sequences and produce a genuine and unmanipulated response.Equally important, however, is Kubrick's extreme moralizing when depicting the actions of the state.  The actions taken to 'help' young Alex come across as little more than a shocking brand of neo-fascism.  It is the very fact that we find Alex's behavior distasteful without any manipulation that serves to make Kubrick's point.  We must preserve our right to free expression and trust in the people to make the appropriate determination as to the legitimacy of the work.  As this film shows, the alternative to such freedoms is far more heinous and brutal than anything that one individual could possibly produce",10,1,2,4 December 2001
Mr. Holland's Opus," a thinking man's picture
","Clearly, Mr.  Holland's Opus is a film that intends to document the changes that occur throughout the life of a remarkable man.  In doing so, the film does rely heavily on improbable and schmaltzy plot devices (particularly the ending).  That said, this film is so well written and staged that only the most jaded viewer could avoid being swept along with the drama.Both the intentional use of real historical events, and the theme accidental and unintentional heroism beg a comparison to 'Forrest Gump'.  This film is infinitely superior to Gump, however, because it deals with success in terms of great moral acchievment.  'Gump', for all of its overrated praise, merely shows Gump gaining material wealth.  Moreover, 'Holland's' bitter sweet ending is not merely tacked on, but is the logical result of the educational policies of this country.  This film celebrates the great American sense of community by elevating a teacher to heroic status.  This film is truly a wonderful acknowledegment of the hard work put forth every day on on behalf of our children by teachers.  This film is about real Americans, and needn't stray into the utterly fantastic to fill us with a se4nse of wonderment at the life led by Glen Holland.  This is 'Forrest Gump' for thinking people. A nearly perfect film.",8,2,4,6 December 2001
The Godfather," second best film ever
","This is the second best film ever made.  Only 'The Godfather part 2' is better.  Nothing else need be said, but since I ave to get four lines I will point out that Pacino's transformation in this film is one of the most moving performances in history",10,0,1,5 March 2002
