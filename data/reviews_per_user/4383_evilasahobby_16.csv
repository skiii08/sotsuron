Minority Report," Try not to see the holes
","Knowing the pedigree of this film (original concept by Phillip K. Dick and directed by Steven Spielburg) I had some pretty high hopes for it. Sure, I could see that it was an action vehicle for Tom Cruise, but Minority Report followed a recent Hollywood trend of hiring supporting good actors for action movies, so I knew that everything wasn't going to rest on Cruise's acting shoulders. The previews also showed an interesting set-up, so I had some high hopes for this film. Having seen it, my opinion of Minority Report is this:It is a good film providing you don't think about it.Once you start to think about it, you start uncovering plot holes of varying sizes. And every plot hole niggles away at the premise of the film. The pacing of Minority Report is such that you probably won't have time to think about the plot holes as the scenes flash by and you are distracted by the gadgets and narrative twists. Once you leave the cinema, you'll start to go, 'Hey, what about...?' and the credibility of Minority Report will drop.I can appreciate that adapting a short story for a feature film is hard and that social metaphysics often don't translate well in action films. But for every review that mentions Bladerunner in the same breath as Minority Report, consider that this appears to be Spielburg's Bladerunner, where even the dark and dingy areas of the District of Colombia (the film's setting) appear sanitised.  Where Bladerunner contained a number of metaphysical issues about the nature of humanity, Minority Report adds in a cool looking gadget. The issue of Precrime (stopping murder before it happens) is brushed over with no discussion of substance - it exists, just accept it.Minority Report does require a huge suspension of disbelief on behalf of the audience to maintain its credibility. This suspension is aided by the fast pacing of the narrative and by very good acting performances (Samantha Morton as Agatha and Max Von Sydow are great to watch). But as soon as you start to think about it...",7,1,1,21 June 2002
Unbreakable," Another great film from M. Night S.
","Unbreakable is a film you will either love or hate. People who love it point to the great acting, the strong characterisation, the original plot (among others) to prove its superiority. Critics will talk about how slow the film is, how stupid the plot, how it makes very little sense (among others) in discussing the film's flaws. As someone who loved this film, I find it hard to reconcile the two viewpoints, but can see where the opposition is coming from.***Possible Spoiler***It all comes down to one point: can you accept a superhero theme in a serious film? It has been my experience a lot of people can't. It seems that people will accept ghosts (as in M. Night S.'s other film, The Sixth Sense) without hesitation, but unless a superhero has their underwear on the outside, it makes no sense, or is stupid. Unbreakable (like The Sixth Sense) places the extraordinary right in the middle of the ordinary, and asks us to accept it.I could, and found this a great, slow burn kind of film. It builds over time, working in time with Bruce Willis' working joe as he brings himself to maybe believe that Samuel L. Jackson's character may be telling the truth. Yes, I saw the ending coming, but couldn't pick the 'how' or 'why'. It isn't a crushing twist like The Sixth Sense, but when it hits, a new light is shed on the film and its events.Overall, this film is much stronger than The Sixth Sense, but it asks a greater suspension of belief. If anything, it cements M. Night S. as a director to watch.",9,0,0,25 February 2002
Memento," Modern noir at its best
","Memento is a film that draws strength by its differences. It starts at the end, and works its way back. As the viewer, you are led through a maze of actions and reactions, drawing together slowly, until it is only in the last few minutes the threads are drawn together and the narrative is revealed in all its glory. The hero, far from being the capable man used in almost every other film, appears directionless, and each cut has him questioning what is going on, and how he should react.Solidly acted, with a theme that gets under your skin, Memento is a great film.",9,0,1,13 February 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Better than Ep. 1, but...
","Although it's been said many times before, it's worth repeating: Ep.2 is better than Ep. 1. The story is a bit more adult, something actually happens in this film, and Lucas relies a bit more on the actors than the computer generated images (CGI) to keep you watching. But being better than Ep. 1 isn't that great a stretch, and Ep. 2 still has a number of holes that needed patching to make it a great film.The good points of AOTC include the design, solid acting (mostly) and lots of action towards the end. There were moments that filled me with geekish glee, and the city / weapon / ship design all looked good and suitably impressive. But at almost two and a half hours in length, the eye candy can only distract you for so long.AOTC suffers on a number of fronts. The love story seems stuffed into the film, slowing the film to a drag in places. Dialogue between Anakin and Padme seems forced and unbelievable. Maybe Padme likes whiny, petulant young men, but with the amount of whinging Anakin does you'd think she would get sick of it.There is also a number of unnecessary scenes in AOTC, seemingly placed to either pad the story, or because it would look cool. There are solid chunks of this film that could be cut out of the film with minimal impact to either the film's story or the overall narrative.The 'looks cool' factor also comes into play quite a bit, which isn't a bad thing in itself, but also adds an unnecessary layer to AOTC. A huge number of creatures, weapons and vehicles can be seen througout the movie, and while I went 'whoa, cool!' at a number of them (eg the seismic charges) they were just there to make Lucas look clever and to give toy makers things to sell.My biggest complaint of the film is that it completely lacks any form of subtlty or deeper meaning, no matter how hard it tries. Every time the characters come close to some realisation or a point the audience would have to think about, AOTC telegraphs it so every four-year-old in the audience can follow it. The conspiracy involving the Dark Lords of the Sith is so open and easy to follow you have to wonder why the Jedi still haven't gotten it. It strikes me as odd that in a film where a decapitation occurs centre screen that the narrative caters for children.I hold the Empire Strikes Back as the best of the Star Wars series because it suprises you - AOTC holds no suprises, just a number of sequences where things look really, really good. It is a great build up for Ep. 3, which I can't wait to see, but I am hoping for a bit more depth than AOTC provides.",7,0,0,26 May 2002
The Italian Job," Caper by numbers
","'The Italian Job' is a caper movie done by the numbers. Riding on the back of every caper cliche, it rises to no particular heights and will be a movie footnote by about the end of the month.The biggest problem is that 'The Italian Job' possesses no imagination at all. I've seen it all before and done better then. The acting is fine  the cinematography is completely acceptable, but this film breaks absolutely no new ground.Let's tick off the cliches: - 'old-school' criminal father figure and his protege - another gang member jealous of protege - a double-cross - only bad guys use guns while good-guy criminals don't have to - good criminals always outwit the bad guysAnd that's about the first fifteen minutes. Everything is so predictable. Even the heist and car chase scenes, supposedly the highlight of the movie, seem pretty ordinary. This is especially true since they appeared in the trailers for the film so I already knew what to look for.For me, a caper film works only if it has an element of realism - that maybe, just maybe, it could be pulled off without relying on a deux ex machina or 'just because' moments. Parts of 'The Italian Job' just throws that out the window, with computers doing things that computers can't do, the good guys not hitting anyone with their driving (especially going down the stairs) and not one single police car responding to street explosions, recklessly driven minis or even a low flying helicopter. Must be a heck of a city for these things not to rate a response.The acting is passable, with the crew (Seth Green, Jason Stratham and Mos Def) being at least fun to watch. Mark Wahlberg is just too smarmy as the 'nice guy' hero while Charlize Theron is about the only actor called on to display some kind of range. Donald Sutherland is a class act as always and shows up Wahlberg's deficiencies every moment they are together.Overall this is a pretty uninteresting film. Given the IMDb ratings, it's the girls that really love this film, which I can understand to some extent, but there are such better caper films out there - even the vapidness of the recent 'Ocean's Eleven' outshines the non-event that is 'The Italian Job'.
***SPOILER***At the conclusion, take a moment to think about what is going to happen to Norton's character. Are we meant to be cheering the good guys for causing his demise, especially since it would appear to be long and painful? He didn't deserve that, simpering creep that he was.***END SPOILER***",3,19,32,15 August 2003
The Thing," A horror film that stands the test of time
","Less than successful on release, 'The Thing' is a horror film that really stands the test of time. Its special effects (which are key to the atmosphere of the film) haven't dated that badly at all and don't distract the watcher from the film with too much obvious 'fakeness'. That's not to say everything looks ultra-real, but given that two decades has passed since the original release, this movie has done pretty well.The major attraction to this film is its atmosphere. Stuck on an ice base with an alien that can impersonate anyone, a type of claustrophobic paranoia starts to take shape. This is aided that characters will disappear for long times only to reappear later and not all the action is shown - the audience is never quite sure who hasn't been contaminated.'They Thing' is a seminal horror film that relies on tension rather than gore to draw the audience in. It's a pity that not more horror directors haven't learned from this film (and what's even worse is that Carpenter himself seems to have forgotten too!).",7,1,2,7 March 2003
Resident Evil," A good zombie film, but not a good film
","Resident Evil isn't a bad film, just nothing exceptional. As a zombie film, it hits its marks, but doesn't do anything to distinguish itself from the pack. Day of the Dead is a much better film if you want to see the walking dead in action.As a video game adaption, it does what any good adaption does: keep only the bare bones of the material and build new flesh over them. The original story contained in the game has thrown out. Unlike some game adaptions (Double Dragon, for instance) it works in this case, but mainly because the original story was a generic zombie / mad science plot. The Resident Evil movie has just taken one version of zombies / mad science and replaced it with another. In fact, the links to the game are so tenuous (apart from the theme and some stylistic factors) you wonder if the license was bought to attract a greater audience.The big problem with the film is that the narrative gets weaker as the film progresses. Starting with the stealing of the T-virus (the zombie making agent) and the smashing of a T-virus tube in the lab (because the thief was evil, as far as I can tell), the computer security system known as the Red Queen locks down the facility and kills all the employees. It's a great start, and the use of security cameras as a view point for the audience is a great effect because you get to see the Red Queen's abilities and depersonalised status. From here on it's downhill in regards to the narrative - some flashbacks, a weak backstory surrounding attempted corporate espionage and characters making stupid / evil decisions against all common sense. You got bitten by a zombie for which there is no cure? Hey, hang around us, please! A top secret bio-warfare facility went into lockdown? First thing we should do is open it up!There are some great moments, such as the appearance of the skinless dogs. But there are so many holes in the story the movie suffers. That said, the ending does leave a huge gaping hole for a sequel, and if one is made I'll go and see and pick it apart too!",7,0,0,10 May 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," An action packed middle to the LOTR saga
","Lord of the Ring: The Two Towers hits almost all the right notes in its adaption of JRR Tolkein's work to the screen. Starting with a fantastic scene straight off the bat, there is little doubt that this movie will be action packed and full throttle.This is a great middle section to the LOTR saga. Arguments can be made about how true it stayed to sections of the book and how the changes influenced the story, but given that the movie stayed internally consistent, these gripes are possibly misfired. In adapting a book for the screen changes are always going to be made - the important thing is for those changes to be consistent to the overall narrative as it appears on screen. In TTT's case, Peter Jackson has made changes that have arguably added to the picture.TTT has some of the greatest battle scenes shown on film thus far. Although shying away from the visceral reality of Saving Private Ryan, these battles are epic in scope and brutal to watch. These battles also avoid skewing into the 'hero beats all' stereotypes that so many fantasy films enter into - each battle sees both sides take casualties, which sometimes include more than just the nameless rabble.The flaws in TTT are almost unavoidable given the adapted material. Firstly, it is sometimes disrupting to move from one of the story arcs (say Aragon, Legolas and Gimli's) to another (Frodo and Samwise's). Unfortunately the most important journey to the narrative in Frodo's and Samwise's journey to Mt Doom is also the least interesting to watch which also disrupts the enjoyment of TTT. The final problem is that none of the characters really seem to develop to the same capacity of FOTR; the exception here is Golum, who is the most memorable character contained within this sequel.That said, these are minor points. TTT continues the LOTR's epic scope and vision. With the Return of the King due out on Boxing Day 2003, TTT has set up the audience for an exciting and dynamic conclusion to this epic fantasy saga.",9,0,0,19 January 2003
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Enjoy the ride!
","'Kill Bill' is an interesting film in that it's in a genre I consider a guilty pleasure yet many other people consider incredibly stupid or without merit... until a name writer / director does it, then it is valid to enjoy. If QT wasn't attached to this project, there would not be the cry of 'ART!' that seems to surround 'Kill Bill'.Incredibly brutal in parts, sometimes tinged with black humour, 'Kill Bill' is an experience I enjoyed very much, but will need to see the conclusion before being able to decide exactly what to think of this movie. At the moment, it is certainly not a masterpiece. Personally, it is more like a rollercoaster - thrilling, shocking, enjoyable - but hardly high art.
For all its fans, this movie is just another blockbuster albeit done with style. QT's talents at framing scenes is working perfectly and there are some very memorable moments, but it's a martial arts film. For all the talk of homages and referencing, there isn't any real soul to this movie. You get on, enjoy the ride and get off, not once stopping to think about the greater ramifications of it.I am certainly looking forward to seeing Volume 2; let's hope it is worth the noise that has surrounded the decision to split it.",8,0,1,20 October 2003
From Hell," Stylistic and empty
","Let me start off by saying _From Hell_ is not a bad film. It is stylistically very striking, and the Hughes Brothers have done a great job in getting London dirty in recreating Victorian times. The atmosphere, the characters (with the exception of the luminous Heather Graham, the cleanest whore in all of London!) are all consistent with a dank, dirty city. The murders are well shot, all the actors are hit their marks, and the film doesn't sensationalise the violence to a great extent.But... having read the graphic novel the movie is based on, I was disappointed. Alan Moore's tale sought to humanize a group of people preyed upon by the Ripper while bringing some motivation to the Ripper murders. The murderer is known from the outset, and it is the character interplay and the metaphysics of the story that provide the fiction's flavour.The Hughes Brothers have instead chose to make a whodunnit of the tale, and have cut out a lot of the story away. I could see the trails of the original narrative trailing throughout the movie, but that only left me disappointed when I saw other bits left out. Mr Moore's narrative would I have been very difficult to film, and would have lasted for hours. Even so, I felt more could have been done. In chaptering the style of _From Hell_, I feel the Hughes Brothers have left out the heart.And I feel for those confused by the end of the movie. It makes some sense in the graphic novel, but really seems dropped out of nowhere in the film.Overall, not a bad film, but it was unable to live up to the source material.",5,3,6,25 February 2002
Enemy at the Gates," A great war film that doesn't involve the US.
","I've scanned several comments placed on the imdb board about Enemy at the Gates, and felt a need to respond. I really enjoyed this film, with a few exceptions, and feel some of the posts are a bit over the top in negativity.My theory is that this film is so overlooked because it doesn't involve the US, rather two 'enemy' nations - the USSR and Nazi Germany. If the US was involved, more things would have been forgiven in this film. Enemy at the Gates attempts to move the audience's attention away from the uniforms and towards the people involved in the battle. Yes, it is framed in a hero-versus-villain narrative, where we all cheer for the underdog, but it is done more intelligently than (for instance) Saving Private Ryan with its 'USA all the way' sentimentality.The complaints about the use of accents are totally misplaced. Did anyone else notice that the Russians spoke with english accents while the Nazis spoke in american accents? Does anyone else think this is deliberate? I certainly do. Arguing that the accents takes the attention away from the film because they were different to what they should be ('Ze germans! Ze germans!') are rather short-sighted. The accents were used to differentiate the conflicting sides to the audience, nothing more.I also found the romance a little tacked on to the movie, but it isn't that distracting. It does contain a realistic element or two, and serves to give the characters something to loose and / or fight over.The real thrill is the battle between the two snipers. Leaving behind huge explosions at the films climax, it all comes down to a battle of skill and patience. Good war films reduce the conflict of thousands into a conflict of just a few people (in this case two) that the movie follows. Enemy at the Gates does this successfully.Parts of this film are flawed. It does seem to follow the dramatic structure of Saving Private Ryan in dropping us straight into a horrific battle where one in every two Russian soldiers is given a rifle and the other is told to pick it up when the holder dies. Still, the technique works and does grab you. Parts of the film also feel a bit cliched (eg the love triangle) but a solid cast does manage to lift above this. Ed Harris is fantastic and Jude Law does a very solid job.Finally, for all those people who went 'there was no gate and no enemy standing at it', well... sheesh. I'll explain it for you, since you obviously missed the film's explanation. Stalingrad was seen as a key city for the Nazis to overtake if they were to conquer the USSR. If Stalingrad fell, it was a) a slap in the face to Stalin who oh-so-modestly named it, and b) it was then a short trip to the capital (St Petersberg? Leningrad? I forget!) and victory. The Nazis were the enemies at the gate of the USSR's capital. Easy.",8,0,2,31 May 2002
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," A very literal translation of the book
","_Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets_ is a very enjoyable film to watch. Each scene moves along smoothly, making the near 3hr running time seem much shorter. Each actor falls solidly into the character they are playing, with Jason Isaacs solidly nailing the villainous Lucias Malfoy - every scene he has is fantastic.There have been some complaints about the CGI, but it works within the film. Certainly, not all the special effects are photo-realistic, but they are close enough and certainly don't ruin the audience's involvement in the film. The mixture of CGI and animatronics works very well and brings the concept of a 'magic school' to life._Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets_' major failing is that it sticks too closely to the book. This has been a common complaint about the film because it causes what appears to be deus ex machina after deus ex machina to save Harry from the situation he is in. The book may have the room to explain why (for example) the Weasly's flying car suddenly appears out of nowhere to save our heroes, whereas the film ignores the reason. Character motivations are also not examined, an example being Harry having the opportunity several times to unburden his problems to one of his teachers, yet always choosing to go it alone. In ignoring the deeper aspects of the book the movie tends to only reflect the superficial which can be frustrating to the viewer.Despite this setback, this _Harry Potter_ film is very enjoyable. The ending climatic scenes may not be enjoyed by younger children due to its violence, but this is a small point. Whether it will stand up to the other great fantasy adaption of this period (_The Two Towers_), well, we'll just have to wait and see...",7,0,0,7 December 2002
Blow," A human tale about a drug dealer
","'Blow' is one of those interesting films that takes a fairly objective look at an unusual life; in this case, George Jung (Johnny Depp), a major drug dealer in the 70's / 80's. Instead of taking a moralistic view of what George does, it simply focuses on what happened in a semi-realistic manner (well, as real as celluloid can be, anyway). George sold drugs - lots of them at that - and is at least partially responsible for introducing cocaine to the US.It would be very easy to show George as either a 'hero' or 'villain' in this film. Instead, 'Blow' takes the more interesting route of simply seeing things through George's eyes both on the way up and then on the way down. It's a very human narrative; you may not agree with what George does, but it is very easy to see why he does it.Of most interest to me is the relationship between George and his father (expertly played by Ray Liotta). Instead of chewing his son out for his choices, George's father only wants to see George happy. Although not necessarily agreeing with George's life choices, as a father he is willing to stand aside and let his child live his own life. It is nice to see such a relationship on screen rather than the traditional Hollywood father / son depiction.'Blow' is well acted with Depp, Liotta and Rachel Griffiths (as George's mother) giving very realistic and measured performances. Although the film does drag at times, it is none-the-less compelling to see the rise and almost inevitable fall of someone in a less than legitimate profession.As a final note, I have to give special credit to Depp for wearing possibly the worst clothing and hairstyles this side of 90's film-making. Almost without exception each new outfit is worse than the last! It really does add to the realism of the film though - George looks consistent in fashion choices as he ages and it makes sense to the character (ie his fashion taste developed as a stoner in the 70's and stayed there!).",7,0,1,17 June 2003
Signs," Excellent spiritual brother to 'Independence Day'
","M. Night Shyamalan's films always impress me and have gotten better as time goes on. 'The Sixth Sense' was good, but relied heavily on the ending to raise it above the normal supernatural thriller. 'Unbreakable' was superb with an ending that justifies the events of the movie. 'Signs' follows this trend, this time using space aliens and UFOs as the vehicle to deliver the film's message.*Some spoilers below*As with all Shyamalan's films, in order to accept the film the audience must accept the world view (typically a supernatural theme in a real world environment) that the narrative is putting across. Don't believe in ghosts? 'The Sixth Sense' was probably a waste of time for you. Think comic books are stupid? 'Unbreakable' probably won't rock your world. If you can't accept the concept of aliens arriving on Earth and making crop circles, then you probably won't enjoy 'Signs'.'Signs' really reminded me of 'Independence Day', shrunk to the personal level. For the ordinary man, taking on the alien hordes in a Raptor while building a computer virus on an Apple computer is inconceivable. Hiding in your basement isn't. The Hess family react in an understandable fashion when confronted with the unknown - they hide in their house. Everything is kept on the small and personal level, which makes the audience become so much more involved. Forget saving the world - Mel Gibson's character is just trying to save his family.'Signs' also contains an atmosphere of creepy tension that is uncommon and hugely effective. Shyamalan obeys the golden rule of creature suspense - don't let the audience see the creature until the last moment. The unknown is much more fear-inducing than anything that CGI can cook up, with 'Signs'' use of the unknown and half-seen being among the best I have seen on film. Revealing the alien at the end is a bit of a let down, but does give the film it's climax.At it's heart 'Signs' does contain a message about faith that is delivered in a reasonably un-preachy way. I hate having feel-good messages rammed down my throat, but 'Signs' doesn't do that; the faith message is important to the characters' motivations in the film rather than a message for all of us to live by. The audience can take away what it wants.As can be seen by other comments, 'Signs' has a lot of detractors. Personally it was great to see an alien film where the US doesn't have all the answers and kicks the aliens off the planet just in time for the romantic leads to get together. Imagine - a film where some other country other than the US finds a way to repel the aliens first.
In regards to what the aliens can and can't do, or what they should or shouldn't have thought - we don't know. That's a huge part of the film - the aliens remain alien, unknown and inhuman. Who knows why they did what they did or what they could do?'Signs' is a worthy film to the Shyamalan film catalogue - I can't wait to see what his next release is, supernatural thriller or not.",8,0,2,17 March 2003
Gangs of New York," American Folklore
","'Gangs of New York' is a great film, dominated by Scorsese's style and contains an in-your-face quality that few other films have. A huge influencing factor in this movie is the ability of Daniel Day-Lewis to make his character, Bill Cutting, one of the great villains - full of menace at every turn, yet intelligent, determined and strangely rational. Bill 'The Butcher' Cutting could have easily been a vaudevillian bad guy, moustache twirling and all, but Mr Day-Lewis gives him qualities that make him the true character center of this film.Jim Broadbent as Boss Tweed is also worth mentioning. Tweed's political manipulations are entertaining to watch and provide an extra dimension to 'Gangs...'. Of the main actors, DiCaprio and Diaz are sufficient in what they do, but 'Gangs...' suffers from their unneeded relationship scenes. The true focus of this film is the city of New York itself and its impact on those who lived in its boundries during its formation - Scorsese's love of NYC comes clearly across on the big screen, along with his willingness to look at the bad sections along with the good.Another reviewer compared the fight scenes in this movie to those from 'LOTR: The Two Towers'. I found I was much more involved in the brutal gang fights of 'Gangs...' than I ever was in the massed battles of 'LOTR:TTT'. Those who have a low tolerance for violence may find 'Gangs...' a bit graphic, but what did you expect from a Scorsese film?It should be said that 'Gangs...' is more american folklore than american history. Certainly the major events in the film occurred, with many of the attitudes of the film reflecting the attitudes and lifestyle of the time, but 'Gangs...' certainly isn't a history lesson. Even the book it draws so much material from is considered a suspect historical source, written by a journalist who recorded the exaggerations of urban tales. That said, it doesn't diminish 'Gangs...' impact at all. Scorsese always loves doing things that are larger than life on the big screen and 'Gangs...' is no different.'Gangs...' major failing is it's ending. I felt a bit dismayed that such an epic film resorted to a fairly unsatisfactory conclusion that was almost completely separate to what had been driving the rest of the narrative. All in all, this is a small point - 'Gangs of New York' is a powerful film that overcomes a few flaws in its portrayal of some great american folklore.",8,0,0,3 March 2003
Donnie Darko," A very different film that just misses being cliched
","Having seen Donnie Darko (DD), I know why it draws such different views and widespread discussion. DD doesn't give the audience any easy answers while raising questions for the audience. Although there is aspects of time travel, mental illness, teenage confusion, a misguided community and yes, a large evil-looking talking rabbit, this film is greater than the sum of its parts. DD is possibly the 80's teen film to end all retrospective 80's teen films while managing to avoid most of the cliches that surround this genre.Much like a David Lynch film, DD draws the extraordinary and the corrupt from the shadows of American suburbia and makes for fascinating watching. Unlike David Lynch however, this movie has no real loose ends or events that seem to occur randomly. You may ask why this event occurred (especially with the climax) but everything is internally consistent - the real questions arise about the motivation of the characters who revolve around DD.At times this movie can seem to move a little slow, but everything has the feel of measured and deliberate pacing in retrospect. Not knowing what is coming up next is fantastic. Even normal events can often skew far beyond expectations and the sense of 'where is this going?' really adds to the atmosphere.As said before, DD still hits some cliches - the bad kid, the teacher who doesn't understand, the parents who try but just can't be there, the misunderstood teen in Donnie himself. No doubt some audiences have mistaken the lack of a definite answer(s) to be a sign of great cinematic depth, whereas other audiences will simply see the film's resolution to be lazy and borderline cheating in using the oldest cliche of all. For me, the enjoyment of Donnie Darko comes not from the destination but the journey the characters take. A very different film that is unlikely to be matched for quite a while.",8,0,0,4 February 2003
