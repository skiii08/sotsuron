The Blair Witch Project," A 'screw with your head' not a 'hack and slash' movie.
","I really enjoyed the whole concept of this movie. If you're hoping for a slasher film, give it up. If you're hoping for an eerie 'screw with your head' type of movie, then you might enjoy this. This definitely isn't everyone's cup of tea, but it has stayed on my mind all day. I'll certainly have to rethink my camping plans... (I go next week... I hope I return! ;-) )",9,1,2,18 July 1999
X-Men," COOL!
","This movie rocks! Patrick Stewart was made for the part he played! The script is great! There are only a couple people in the movie (Maybe in a sequel) like Beast, Nightcrawler, and Collossus. I also think that sentinals would have been good in the movie. - Ryan Vals son, age 10",Null,0,0,21 July 2000
Eyes Wide Shut," Disappointed
","This movie was very disappointing. The first thing that bothered me was the script. I expected quality writing, but it wasn't there. Then there was the acting. There were scenes where the audience was on the edge of their seats alright, but it was because we wanted them to hurry up and say the next word! An overheard comment when the movie was over summed it up nicely, 'It was as if the director said 'Count to three between each word!''
Then there was the annoying single-note piano playing. Piano soundtracks have worked with other Cruise films, but in this one, it was just plain irritating.We get to see a lot of Nicole Kidman in the nude, but there is really very little sex. Yes, there's an orgy scene, but they've edited the film to place other people in strategic spots so you can't see anything. Some people want to see 'Tom and Nicole together.' Forget it. The one 'teaser' scene you see in the previews is all you're going to get. You see them with their tops off, and he starts to kiss her neck. Then she gets p***ed off and that's the end of that. You never see Tom have sex with *anyone*.Another irritating point is when Nicole is smoking pot. She (the actress) must have never smoked, because her reaction is totally wrong. She seems to talk even slower than she did before, and then starts getting angry. 'Tom' comments 'It's just the pot making you aggressive.'  What is this, an ad from the PDFA? *Alcohol* makes you aggressive, not pot.
All in all it was extremely disappointing and LONG. Way too long.",1,15,26,18 July 1999
