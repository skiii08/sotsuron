Angels & Demons," The writers, actors, and producers deserve to have the word 'Illuminati' branded on their chest!!!
","I just finished reading the book 'Angels and Demons' less than a week ago and I thought it was incredible. In fact one of the best books I have ever read. It had such an awesome story and had a powerful message behind it. However, I was anxious to see what the movie would be like because I was not impressed at all with the Da Vinci code. I thought how could they possible make the movie any worse than the last one, but boy was I wrong! They changed everything in the movie and completely destroyed the plot and meaning behind the book. Also the acting was horrific. None of the characters had any chemistry and never developed unlike the book. I highly recommend reading Angels and Demons, but I beg you not to waste your time and money on this piece of crap!!!",1,33,77,15 May 2009
