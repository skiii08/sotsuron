The Equalizer," The Equalizer
","I've got to say, I want to see more of Robert McCall, the main protagonist of Equalizer. This guy is a realistic badass, using his skill and perfect timing to even the odds in a one-man-war against the Russian mob, who have taken over his city.At first, I didn't buy this movie (figuratively speaking). First maybe 30 minutes were a snore, but once it got into it's odd groove, the movie is pretty cool. Some little bugs, like an overuse of slow-motion (in an attempt to make it 'cooler') and some other stuff, but the overall product isn't bad.The musical score is awesome. The only time I remember a better one is in Transformers (you can hate on the movie series, but the musical score is one of the best I've heard). The acting from Washington is believable.The overall believability in this movie help it gain it's own footing in the individuality.One of the things I wished they focused more on is his past. It's so murky, that it leaves you scratching your head.The movie is gritty, dark, and again, realistic.The preview was promising, the style was cool, but in the end, most of the movie until the end is boring. No immature boob shots, so hurray!",7,0,1,29 January 2015
Lone Survivor," Purely disgusting
","There are movies that are called 'based on a true story' that are so fantasized that calling them a true story becomes incredibly illogical. This movie disgusts me because it thinks that if you show a bunch of clips of marines and call it a true story that it must be hailed as 'inspiring' and 'a story of true courage', when there are obvious moments that it's impossible for the single survivor to have known that they happened. So I can fairly criticize this as a film without any qualms. You can't just fly a banner that says 'war movie' and evade criticism... well, you can avoid the critics at the idiotic aggregators and the idiots who see 'based on true acts of courage' and automatically call it the greatest film of the year.This movie is comically bad. It barely shows any of the humanity of the soldiers, making their deaths lack impact. And you know that everybody's going to die from the get-go because of the title, meaning it needed to have impact. And it doesn't. It has horrible pacing, terrible camera, and the portrayal of the Muslim characters is laughable at best. Like American Sniper, this film is Jingoistic, portraying all Muslim characters as either stupid terrorists or just stupid.The musical score is bad too. The action sequences are like American Sniper; a scope lines up with a terrorist, and then it jump cuts to the person dying. Wow, that's intense. Great action really, because there totally aren't sniper movies that do more. Totally. The movie completely overuses slow motion with multiple sequences where nothing happens except soldiers falling down the mountainsides. Wow, riveting.The dialogue is poorly written; never does anybody feel heroic or humane. Quite the opposite. And that's the worst part about it. It feels disrespectful, because that's what it is. You can't take a story of a group of heroes, turn it into just another Hollywood garbage film, plaster 'true story' on it, play a sad song at the end with pictures of the real soldiers, and then get massive dough and avoid any and all criticism. Sorry Hollywood, I won't fall for this bullshit. Lone Survivor gets a 3/10. ï»¿",3,1,3,22 July 2015
Blade," Not a great comic book adaptation (this is coming from a comic fan), but it's a great movie
","A few months ago, I watched Blade 2 and I've been told it's the best in the trilogy. I also watched the end of Blade: Trinity (it was on TV so there was no reason not to). A few days ago, I finally watched the first movie of the trilogy.Blade is a Marvel character, half human, half vampire; all of their strengths and none of their weaknesses. The films aren't very accurate; one of the main characters in the films (Whistler) originated in the 90's Spider-Man series and not the comics. There were three major films, and also a TV series.Anyways, this film is good, but not stunning. The action sequences are great. Especially when Blade's kicking some vampire butt, slashing them as they turn to dust. Wesley Snipes does a great job as Blade. He definitely acts like the badass Blade is. The story is okay. Nothing special.Special effects actually aren't that bad for the most part. They don't seem dated or anything. The musical score is good but the soundtrack isn't. The costumes are all well done.Acting is okay besides Wesley. There's some star power in the cast. The dialogue is well written. The tone is dark but it avoids the kinky vampire blood stuff of say, Vampire Diaries, for the most part. It does only as much world building as it needs to, and nothing extra. You could argue that the later installments into the franchise do it better, but I disagree.Blade is a great film but not as good as Blade 2, which is just an improved version of this one. Blade gets an 8/10. It's not phenomenal but it's still pretty awesome. Check it out if you haven't already.﻿",8,0,1,22 July 2015
Big Hero 6," Far from a good adaptation, but also far from a shameless cash-in
","When I first heard about this movie, I dismissed it as a bad Disney cash-in on Marvel.I just watched the movie on Vudu, and I have to say, I'm glad I watched it.There's a lot of padding and things that would put little kids in tears, but the actual movie is really good.First of all, amazing special effects/art. Whoever was in charge of that deserves a raise. They did a fantastic job.Second, the voice acting was awesome. These guys did their jobs perfectly as well.Third, it had amazing characters (which aren't actually pulled from the comics as Silver Samurai and Sunfire are owned by Fox, I believe). Props go to Baymax, as he is an obvious fan favorite and the rest of the props go to Wasabi. Even the ones from the comics were turned into totally different characters, but this was pulled off.While it tries to feel 'Asiatic', it fails and feels like that was thrown in as an after thought.The plot is predictable, but then again, it's a kid's movie. Anything more and kids would be confused and dismiss the movie immediately.And props on the innuendo in two specific scenes involving Baymax and Hiro.The movie was pretty funny, reaching it's high points in the beginning of the movie, and kind of losing it's comedy towards the end, where it gets a bit darker. The best parts were in the trailer, but they're still hilarious when you get to them.The movie scores a 9/10. While not doing justice to the comics, the movie makes these characters its own, and distinguishes itself from other recent Disney movies (like the one trick pony, Frozen), not in originality, but in style and in execution. To only care about how well it did the source is cynical (because, while doing the source justice is very admirable, adapting the source to work with a different audience and making it work is even more so), as I shall point out, now legions of eight and nine year old's will go out and read the comics for more Hiro and Baymax.﻿",9,0,2,22 July 2015
Clash of the Titans," Some flaws, but it's an epic mythology-based action flick.
","I have previously stated that I'm a myth buff, so I might be slightly biased to this movie from the get-go. It also has Sam Worthington from the new Terminator and Man On A Ledge. It also has Gemma Arterton, from Prince Of Persia and some other movies.This movie has it down to the lore for the most part. It's ironclad with epic battles and awesome special effects. It's got awesome characters and great acting. It also has a great cast. The story is interesting, though kind of cliché.And they use Perseus, one of the most ignored myth figures (more on him later).'RELEASE THE KRAKEN!'Can't ignore one of the greatest lines in history.This movie is one of the best, entertainment wise. The fight scenes were fast-paced and awesome, the special effects and musical scores were epic. It's pretty fantastic for a popcorn film with some humor mixed in some parts.However, it's one of those 'clusterfuck of death' movies. Which are annoying go say the least. Like 3.5 soldiers live including Perseus. Yeah, there's a point five in there for a reason, I didn't just randomly throw it in there.Plenty of people rip on the plot and premise, though I gotta say I don't see what they're getting at. Yes, there's your predictable messiah complex, and yeah, the deaths of most of the characters lack impact, but in terms of the world and such, it's actually pretty interesting (though not much is really done with it). The people of Earth begin shunning the Gods, no longer praying towards them, so Hades comes to Olympus and talks Zeus into chastising the humans. And by chastising, I mean brutally murdering and then giving an ultimatum to those still alive: sacrifice the princess of their region or suffer a tentacle-y death (from the Kraken obviously). So Perseus who had been taken into 'custody' and a legion of soldiers go off to find the Moirai, or the Fates, and hopefully find a way to kill the Kraken. The city is taken over by civilians who just want to live, while Perseus and his troupe of soldiers go on their mighty adventure.One big thing I want to criticize from a mythological standpoint is that while Poseidon is portrayed quite well (a psychopathic rapist), Zeus and Hades aren't. Both Zeus and Poseidon had sex with so many creatures before humanity was even a thing, yet Zeus genuinely wants Perseus (his son; a demigod) to survive/not be killed by the Kraken. Dude, Zeus would want to eat Perseus if anything to prevent his own death, which is something he did A LOT in the mythology, because he was paranoid. Hades, as usual in Hollywood fashion, is portrayed as your usual bad guy. And just so everybody who isn't a myth buff knows, Hades wasn't actually a bad guy. He kinda got screwed over and thrown into the Underworld, but he was actually a good guy; his brothers were asses, but I digress. The worst thing he did was kidnap Persephone and force her into marriage, and while it's no defense for what he did, here's why he did it: he didn't know any better. He lived in his father's stomach for years, only to be sent to the Underworld after the war against the Titans where there was no time for love. He kinda was just stuck there and never really learned a good way to romance, so when he saw this beautiful and nice girl, he practically hopped on a chariot, went into the overworld, picked her up and drove her back down with him. He was lonely and again, not an excuse, but that's the reason. And you can tell he was a good guy because he still let her go to the overworld one day every year (which is when spring begins). So he suffers the same fate of Magneto: misused as the token villain. It gets a 10/10. It's epic. Don't listen to the critics, this is an awesome movie. One of my favorites. Definitely better than 'Wrath'. I hope Rage can return this franchise to its roots of badassery.﻿ While it does a good job of respecting the mythos, it still does its own thing. For example, the Perseus of myth, like most heroes, had no real personality. Instead here, he does some (thin) depth.I haven't seen the original Titans film (I own it, I just haven't gotten around to it yet), but I'm pretty sure most people hate this because 'Aaaargh! Reboot!'. But my family (who has seen it) explained to me where this film deviated from the original, so I can tell you that this film does its own thing; but on the other hand, it does respect the original with some Easter eggs (which I found out via wiki lol)",10,2,3,29 July 2015
Looper," Looper: one of the worst movies of all time
","When you have an all star cast and a great trailer and you still buzz under the radar, it's worrying to some consumers.I didn't expect Looper to be a massive cluster**** like it was.The trailer looked interesting, the guns looked cool, the cast had J Gordon Levitt and Bruce Willis, the plot seemed nice, but once you watch this movie, you wonder what the hell just happened.First things first, nothing went right with this movie except for maybe should'ves.The movie is painstaking to watch, immature, nonsensical, stupid, lazy, boring, and just feels disconnected. Like, what you're watching has nothing to do with you. Not the kind of movie I want to watch. I want to be dragged into the atmosphere.The plot is so convoluted that it leaves you out of the LOOP about twenty thousand times.I'm done with this movie. There is nothing to like about this movie except for when it ends. And when it ends, it feels like somebody threw you in lava, dragged you out, and did everything to make you feel better than ever. Know why? You've just began your life after watching this garbage. Now you realize how better life is. And it might seem like I'm exaggerating, but I'm not kidding. This movie is awful. I want to give it a zero. If there was ever a movie that deserved a zero, it's this garbage. One of the worst movies ever, and if you've watched it, you probably agree. And if you're one of the people who helped it get a 7, shame on you, sadist.",1,0,1,29 January 2015
Kingsman: The Secret Service," In the runnings for film of the year
","Kingsman is the movie adaptation of Mark Millar's comic of the same name. I've never even heard of it for some reason (I am something of a 'comic aficionado' and me not hearing about a comic notable and popular enough to be adapted is practically unprecedented), but I'll definitely be on the lookout for it.This is a fun movie through and through, taking the spy genre and absolutely flipping it on its head. It basically does what it wants in the name of style.It has a fantastic musical score, the best of the year, thus far. The special effects are a mixed bag; some are fugly and others look nice.There's plenty of comedy to be had and even the action sequences reflect that. Dialogue is well-crafted and snappy.Acting is well-done and it has an all-star cast, including Michael Caine and Samuel L. Jackson. Characters all seem pretty different and we'll brought together.Action sequences would be very good if it weren't for CGI and too much slow-motion, but this problem is fixed for the most part towards the end of the film.Kingsman is a fun movie that wears its uniqueness on its sleeve. This movie is definitely worth a 9/10, at least for me. It's fun and has no major pacing problems, but I feel action sequences are a bit weak for a movie that should rely on it. Best movie I've seen this year, so far.﻿",9,2,7,22 July 2015
