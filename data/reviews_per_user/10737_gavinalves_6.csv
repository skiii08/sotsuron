It," A Wonderful Renewal of an Amazing Book
","It (2017) is a great addition to the long list of Stephen King adaptations. The child acting was good, not amazing, but not bad. The scene in which Georgie gets his arm taken off was a bit under-acted, but it is understandable. The portrayal of Pennywise, the dancing clown, by Bill Skarsg√•rd was outstanding. He gave an entirely new and refreshing take on the clown and definitely added to the overall well-being of the movie. The movie was not particularly scary, but it was very entertaining. The movie had some flaws, including a few scenes that did not sit well with the flow of the movie, but the cinematography, acting, and script was overall really good.",8,0,0,19 January 2018
American History X," A Touching and Impactful Movie
","While scrolling through IMDb, I stumbled across American History X. Intrigued by the plot summary, I decided to watch the movie with high expectations. Those high expectations were shattered with the incredible acting, heart wrenching, and soul churning scenes that unfold. This movie is extraordinary in every aspect. I enjoyed every aspect of the movie and would watch it again. The ending takes a stab into the viewers emotions, showing us the untimely death of our would-be protagonist. The scene only worsens when Derek rushes to the school and finds his younger brother lying dead in the urinal. The screams, shrieks, and cries from Derek nearly brought me to tears. The journey he had undergone, though revolutionary, was not enough to save his younger brother from the fate that was already sealed from following in his path of being a Neo-Nazi.The journey that is shown throughout the movie, switching from black and white to color, beautifully shows the outlook on life which Derek abides by, separating those who are not White Protestants from anyone else. The color change is extraordinary to convey his character transformation.The ending, as stated before, is one of the best scenes in the movie, pulling at the heart strings of the reader. Danny's fate is sealed once he blows the puff of smoke into the face of the African American student. This fate was carried out by Danny by worshiping the actions and ideology in which his older brother, Derek, dominated.The opening scene of the car robbery set the mood for the rest of the movie, not pulling back any punches when it came to brutality. The opening scene, however, also showed the contempt that Danny has for the final actions of Derek. Derek's murder of two African American men attempting to break into his car changed Danny forever. This change, however, is suppressed by Danny in order to be more like his brother. When Danny discovers the massive change in Derek, his frustration is let out by pushing him against a garage many times. This anger seems to be coming from the confusion Danny now faces on whether to follow his brother again or stick to what he made himself believe.All in all, this is an amazing movie and I would recommend this to any friend.",10,1,2,26 April 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," A Decent but Lacking Film
","Star Wars: The Last Jedi is an okay film, but it is not a great film. It has scenes that are amazing, boring, and terrible. The entire story with Rose and Finn is worthless. It adds NOTHING! This was such a terrible waste of time that made many of the fans angry with the entire franchise. The death of snoke was a disgrace. He was brought up to be powerful and mighty and dies in such a boring way. Luke's death was dignified. I liked his death, but his character ark throughout the entire movie was not what he was remembered as in the original series. The opening scenes that starts with a prank call ruined the mood. The lightspeed death scene was awesome and beautifully shot. Leia's mary poppins act was awful. The acting was decent. Rose was a terrible character. Kylo Ren was given more backstory and Adam Driver did well as him. The shirtless scene was worthless, though. Rey was alright in the movie, but it seems as if they want to leave her best performance for the last movie.",6,1,2,19 January 2018
The Dark Knight," The Greatest Superhero Movie of All Time
","Batman: The Dark Knight is the greatest superhero movie of all time. Its cinematography, pacing, and acting are unmatched by any other movie of the genre. However, it is also one of the greatest movies ever created. It is a masterpiece in its craft. The portrayal of The Joker by Heath Ledger is outstanding and he deserved the Oscar he received posthumously for the role. The tension and the set pieces are amazing. Nolan's use of practical effects is what makes the movie so visually appealing, unlike a movie such as Avengers: Age of Ultron with the massive use of CGI. Bale's second portrayal as the caped crusader is one that puts him down as one of the greatest Batmans of all time. Harvey Dent's transformation is also done with perfect pacing as the audience slowly see the character's attitude and morale change throughout the movie up until his transformation from the explosion. Also, the editing is done so intricately and perfectly to a point where the viewer never wants to look away from the screen. This movie is a MUST SEE!",10,0,1,7 June 2018
A Beautiful Mind," Exceptional and Tear-jerking Movie
","'A Beautiful Mind' is a great example of amazing direction to an interesting story. The work of John Nash may not seem all that interesting when told by a normal person, BUT, the direction makes the story pop. The performance from Russel Crowe was superb. Overall, this movie nearly brought tears to my eyes in multiple scenes. The success of Nash in the beginning of the movie set it up to be happy-feel good movie, but devolving into mental illness turned the film on its head and gave more life than what I originally expected. The ending brings tears to my eyes. Sadly, the only thing I was frustrated with was that I only discovered the movie now, instead of years prior. Amazing movie, would definitely recommend.",10,1,2,2 September 2018
The Conjuring," Chilling Movie
","The Conjuring is a movie that many people would see with their friends as a joke, but end up curled up in a ball by the end of it. The chilling and suspenseful scenes that plague the movie only add to the overall horrific tone that is present in the movie. The sound design and lack there of it for some scenes adds to the suspense tenfold, causing the hairs to stick up on the back of the necks of viewers. The acting is good, including a mix of alright and solid child actors. The story and background is very interesting, but it sets up for the creation of the first Annabelle movie; this turned out to be a terrible idea. However, The Conjuring by itself is a great horror movie and one of the best from the 21st Century.",8,1,1,19 January 2018
