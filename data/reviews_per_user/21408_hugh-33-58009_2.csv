The Lobster," Pretentious and dull when it's not being disturbing or disgusting
","We went into this movie with high hopes for some sort of absurdist black comedy, as it's being billed - and as many reviewers have described it. Instead, we were treated to an overlong, pretentious art project that felt more like an undergraduate student film created by an emotionally stunted sophomore. All the actor's lines are delivered deadpan, with no emotion, regardless of the situation. There is are a few (very minor) chuckles to be sure, but they hardly compensate for the overall deadly serious tone. It's dreary, poorly edited, and contains some revolting scenes involving violent death and extreme animal cruelty. Truly terrible and a waste of a great cast.Spoiler: The ending is.",1,78,136,28 June 2016
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Overrated tour through Tarantino's memory of the 60's
","Extremely well crafted and acted. Brad Pitt is excellent in the lead. Not much of a story. More like an overlong rummage through Quentin's hazy memories and favorite TV shows and movies of the era. An incredible achievement in terms of art direction, set design, and costuming, but it all adds up to something that would have made a great short film.",4,3,7,2 September 2019
