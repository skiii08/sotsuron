Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," As empty as space itself.
","I have been a fan of the Star Wars movies since the original trilogy. Both Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back are among my all-time favorite movies, and like others, I had anxiously awaited the fourth movie....But time -- and other movies (The Matrix, Batman [1989], Independence Day, Titanic, The Shawshank Redemption, Pulp Fiction, Fargo, etc.) tempered my interest. I only had a minor interest in seeing this movie, but now I have, and unfortunately, it is not only worst than the long and loud Return of the Jedi, but is one of the most pathetic movies I've seen in a long time. This is a sad example of what happens when you have too much money and spfx on your hands -- and not a clue to what makes a decent plot. Lucas has had nearly 20 years to develop a story, and instead fell way short. The screenplay is more serious than a Biblical epic, and with fewer laughs. The story did not keep my attention, and left me empty and feeling nothing. These characters - unlike their predecessors - were so distant, I didn't care what happened to any of them. I felt no emotion when Anakin and his mother part; or none when the Neeson character is killed. I wanted to know more about Darth Maul, but was told nothing. And the pod race (which went on and on and on....) was practically lifted from Ben-Hur. The fabulous Samuel L. Jackson was quite wasted, as was Neeson. The least said about Jake Lloyd the better; as a movie buff, I've seen dozens of more talented child actors. Jar-Jar Binks was annoying, but not overly objectionable, for his human counterparts performed - for the most part - worst than the puppet did. I had hoped for more from McGregor and Portman, but after over 2 hours, no longer cared. The final scene - reminiscent of the celebration at the end of the first SW movie - was more pitiful than happy. It is regrettable that this is what Lucas has offered after all these years, and I can only feel sad in thinking that his next 2 movies will likely be more of the same. He'll just slap Star Wars in the title -- and they will come. But not me.",1,1,4,17 May 2000
The Birth of a Nation," Artistic value maybe--top 100 definitely not!!
","As a movie buff, I had always intended to see this film, but as a biracial woman, I also had mixed feelings due to the nature of the movie. But since Gone with the Wind is one of my all-time favorites, I thought I would finally give Griffith's classic a chance and see. Well, I love movies, and I love silents although I'm only in my thirties, but this movie made my eyes water from the pain it was putting me through. I'll toss political correctness to the winds...this movie, despite the few moments of artistic breakthroughs by Kentucky's own D.W. Griffith, the movie was so painfully bad in its' post-Civil War scenes that I was eventually doing my own version of Mystery Science Theater 3000, creating my own dialogue to match the hideous storyline. The sight of seeing Caucasians masquerading as blacks, the spectacle of Klansman riding to the rescue like the Knights of the Round Table...the historical inaccuracies, it made me physically ill until all I could do was laugh at the ridiculousness of it all. How the AFI thought this movie worthy of the top 100 I don't know. Yes, Griffith was a gifted moviemaker, but give credit to his better Orphans of the Storm or even Intolerance or Broken Blossoms. This film shouldn't be banned however. Let it be seen as the racist piece of vitriolic garbage it is. I'll give him minor credit for his Civil War battle scenes, but that is it.",2,7,15,25 May 1999
Elizabeth," Brilliant--a movie worthy of a great woman!
","As a history buff who has been studying Elizabeth I since I was in elementary school, it was such a thrill to learn that a movie on her life--or even part of it was being made. And although this movie has compressed numerous events of her life into a few short years, and some liberties have been taken, this film is more akin to 'The Godfather' saga than an episode of 'Masterpiece Theater'. Cate Blanchett-who should have won the Best Actress Oscar-is incredible as the woman I consider the Woman of the Millennium: intelligent, brilliant, sometimes uncertain, and offering herself as sacrifice to her nation. Geoffrey Rush is outstanding as Francis Walsingham, one of her ministers, who will offer life and limb to protect his Queen. And the underrated Joseph Fiennes again wins us over as Elizabeth's lover, Robert Dudley, who loves her in his own peculiar way, but nearly does a Judas on her. If you didn't love English history before, you will after seeing this. It's only hoped that one day, Elizabeth's great father, Henry VIII, will receive a movie as deserving.",10,0,1,9 May 1999
