Captain Phillips," Salute this Captain!
","WOW! just WOW! I knew going in that this movie was going to be good. Who doesn't like Tom Hanks? He's certainly far away from Forrest Gump here! The plot gets going real quick and after two plus hours, you can't believe it's over. It's one of those movies where you know the ending, but can't wait to get there. All parties involved, from actors, director, cinematographer, were spot on. A thoroughly entertaining watch.The drama, excitement and acting are all top-notch. The action sequences are top of the line and Mr. Greengrass scores again. A must see for any Tom Hanks fan.",10,0,1,1 February 2014
A Star Is Born," A Raw Look into Stardom
","Well, since stealing a satellite feed, I am able to watch movies that are in between the theaters and DVD outlets. Looking at all the ratings for this movie, I tried it on for a spin. The movie doesn't disappoint. Cooper and Gaga really bring their characters out to the front and allow us into their world. The movie hums along well, with supporting cast members doing their jobs. It's a simple enough plot, but Gaga's and Cooper's performance will really stand with you for awhile, as they are that good. If you are looking for a feelgood story? Look elsewhere because this one's a real corker and will leave your head spinning. Great movie, check it out if only for possible Oscar-worthy performances.",10,4,7,18 November 2018
Gravity," Fantastic movie!
","Wow...reading all these comments from people who were asleep during the movie, I was hesitant to watch Gravity. Lessons learned. Don't read amateurish comments. This movie is amazing. I swear I was dizzy the whole movie and am upset I didn't catch it in the theater. You don't know what way is up and when you watch you feel weightless. It's a simple plot that apparently was lost on some who watched it. There are no murders, no subplots to make you think...but absolutely stunning special effects that put YOU into space with Sandy. The movie deserves all the Oscars it received. It didn't win for best picture for a reason...the special effects are the star of the movie and you WILL be talking about it the next day.",10,3,7,29 March 2014
Lone Survivor," Hollywood Fluff
","Going into the movie, I had high hopes, with ratings on this website, word of mouth, box office receipts. I must have missed the memo because I was thoroughly disappointed with the overall message the movie was trying to get across.Why was this movie made? What was the point? How many more movies do we need to exploit our brave Navy Seals? It doesn't put them in a very good light, as many mistakes (according to Hollywood) were made during their fateful mission.Overall, I can see the allure of the movie to those Patriotic Americans who need to validate their belief that we belong in Afghanistan. For the rest of us who have been against this atrocity before we even went there, it's another reason to shake my head.Also, people who claim they are Seals here? I have to call them out...what 'real' Team member would want you to run out and watch them fail?",2,14,28,1 February 2014
Star Trek," OUTSTANDING...this isn't your father's Star Trek
","What an amazing movie...you don't have to be a Trekkie to see that this is an outstanding stand alone movie...great plot, acting, special effects, and a whole bunch of paying homage to the original series...only problem, if there is a sequel, how in the world can they top this one? I agree with a lot of posts...have to see this in the theater...money well spent...The movie starts up right away and sucks you in immediately...easy enough plot to follow and the action is quick and very fast paced...A definite summer blockbuster and should do very well by word of mouth...cannot see any other way to describe this movie...hope there is more...",Null,1,8,23 May 2009
Passengers," Could Have Been Better
","Watched 'Passengers' last night and well, I give it a 6 out of 10. The premise is easy enough and the visuals and the acting is spot on. However, the storyline lacks depth. Without give anything away, the story had the potential to really dig into our humanity, and the choices we make and why, but it wasn't to be. To be clear, the movie does make you think a little about love and what we would do for it, but dang if the director left me hanging with a 'huh?' I was into the movie and you will be also...I am on the fence with this review...I can't give it my highest praise and will not bash it, but it's one of those movies that could have been amazing, if only the people in charge would have dug deeper into us.",6,0,1,16 July 2017
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," You want to laugh for 2 hours? See this one
","Wow...Went to see this yesterday and laughed for 2 hours! A movie that doesn't dumb you down and yes, the humor is crude and the visuals aren't child appropriate, but it doesn't go out of its way to be funny. Every character in the movie is a CHARACTER, in other words, each have their own way to say 'look at me'...and if you are reading this, you will understand if you watch the movie. I really am reluctant to go to comedies, but this is in line with his other movies...this guy is definitely on a roll...enjoy your 2 hours!!Excellent job all around, 7 dollars well spent.",9,4,11,18 May 2008
Orphan," Well done movie...ending???
","A very satisfying movie, but it took way too long to get the story started...I love how the character development took place, and all the characters were well placed, and well acted, but something about the movie wasn't quite right, only because we have seen this genre before...I will not give away the ending but it was too neatly tied up for my taste...up to that? A well done movie with an absolute evil Esther doing things that are very unnerving, and you want to knock her around for awhile. There are a couple of holes that didn't get filled, but overall I would say go see it...It was a very entertaining movie, with some no named actors(not for long) and a good twist/plot. Also good to see CCH after the Shield!",8,2,4,27 July 2009
Spotlight," Fantastic Movie Filled with Sadness
","Going into the theater to see Spotlight, I had read the rave reviews and knew I was in for something special. This movie did not disappoint! Being from Boston, this movie really made me think about my life growing up, as a lot of 'what ifs' came to mind. 'What if' I went to church every Sunday...'what if' I was gullible enough to have a priest lure me into his lair. Spotlight goes straight to the heart of this amazingly sad (and apparently never-ending) saga of the Catholic church and the amount of abuse priests have inflicted on hundreds of victims. The acting is all-around fantastic, from Mr. Keaton to some actors that I am not familiar with, which is an aspect of this fine movie that makes it so profound. Tense throughout, I was saddened to hear that this abuse is an epidemic and probably will never be stopped. The exclamation point was when a member of the audience stood up and told the rest of us '...I am a survivor...' WOW...",10,86,106,28 November 2015
"I, Tonya"," Tonya, we owe you an apology
","Besides being a really good movie, meaning the acting was strong, the plot moves to a kicking soundtrack and I laughed out loud, I was genuinely surprised to learn the heartache that Tonya Harding had to endure growing up. 'I Tonya' is a great depiction of a woman who, unbeknownst to America, didn't have the 'typical' life of what we all think is the clean, happy life of an Olympic skater. Why? Our beloved media of course! Look at all of our skating representatives: oh so pretty and so innocent! So says the media.
 When the 'incident' happened back in the early 90's, us onlookers of course, well, looked. We didn't have the internet back then, which clearly sets this story apart than other true stories. We didn't have Nancy Kerrigan or anyone else tweeting 24/7. We had 'Hard Copy.' Oh wait...we had the major networks too! They controlled the narrative and my goodness did they dig for dirt at every turn. We relied on their stories to frame our perspective. Why was Tonya vilified? Was this the start of our tabloid television? Why yes...if you look closely at the television set near the end...there is a peculiar figure on it...
 These issues are at the heart of 'I Tonya' and are relevant. I owe Tonya a huge apology...I had no idea Mrs. Harding. I hope the rest of your life is a happy one and I will forgive you if you want to give us all the bird. 
P.S. Hand the Best Actress Award to Ms. Janney...hands down the best character she has ever played. Hats off to Margot too!",10,2,3,20 January 2018
Shutter Island," Scorsese's best maybe ever
","Well, just walked out of the theater, not really sure how to sum up the movie I just experienced. Yes, I say 'experienced.' That's what it was, an experience. Too bad it's not included in this year's Oscars; the rest of the year had better be good or it's all over. Why gush over this movie? The story took me places I haven't been before, and DiCaprio is already on next year's best actor list. Disturbing, thought provoking and smart to say the least, I didn't see what was coming. The acting, every shot, classic MS. He gets you in the mood from the start and keeps you where he wants you...you aren't allowed but a small chuckle from time to time, but it quickly subsides and you are back into creep mode. A different story from what we are used to with Scorcese, but he has to be put up there with the best ever. Go watch before someone spoils the ending for you.",10,1,12,20 February 2010
American Hustle," American Hustle...Who's Hustling Who?
","Just watched AH last night and I really enjoyed it. I can see why it was up for so many Oscars because it doesn't allow you to breathe. If you miss something, forget it...it's gone and then you have to rewind your DVD to watch it. There's a lot going on, but I thought Mr. Russell gave us characters that we care about, and that's an important part of any movie. The soundtrack was awesome and mixed with the movie a la Boogie Nights. I laughed a lot at Louis CK's character, and the ending was satisfying. Overall a great watch, even if you really had to pay attention to what Mr.Bale was mumbling for the 2 hours. A great 2 hour ride!",10,0,2,23 March 2014
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Mind Blowing
","Hearing the positive reviews for this latest installment of the Spidey series, I went out on a limb and watched it when it came up on my satellite channel. This movie rocks. Plain and simple. I have never seen animation like this before ever. Clearly the people behind this amazing movie are geniuses. Before the movie even starts we are introduced to the characters and get to know their story. How many movies with real characters fail to do this? A LOT!
The movie hums along like a fine-tuned sports car and after some sequences I had to pick my jaw off the floor.
What an incredible movie and why it's not up for best picture is beyond words. The sheer amount of people involved (ending credits) clearly shows this movie was made with love and Stan (not sure if he saw it before he passed) would be super proud. 2 hours of mayhem I will gladly repeat soon.",10,2,5,24 February 2019
Dunkirk," Mr. Nolan? Thank You!
","Dunkirk. I have never heard of the events of those fateful days during WWII. Thank you Mr. Nolan for bringing this incredible human story to life. And you pulled it off by peeling back the fluff most movies have nowadays to keep us focused. No obvious special effects (if there were, I didn't catch them), no over-the-top explosions or a silly love story to pull our heart strings. No, you managed to keep me enthralled for 106 minutes by keeping things simple, and transporting me to the Port of Dunkirk. In your typical style, you did get me to the edge of my seat. I genuinely, on an emotional level, felt what our protagonists were going through. I was cold, thirsty and feared for my life every time I heard those engines. Thank you Mr. Nolan, for showing me that heroes have always existed, there is hope for humanity, and good will always conquer evil.",10,6,13,7 August 2017
The Lego Movie," Lego of Your Preconceptions
","Just watched The Lego Movie last night...wow...I haven't laughed this hard OUT LOUD at a movie in so long! As a Lego fan growing up, I was eager to see it after the great reviews, and it surely didn't disappoint. All the characters are alive and downright hilarious...from Batman to Green Lantern and Kitty and Abe Lincoln. I can't give away the plot, but it is clear the producers and directors also have an affinity with Legos. The underlying message comes across as fresh; a message everyone can relate to. I enjoyed the ending, although when it came I was exhausted from laughing and giggling for an hour and a half. This movie earns the high marks due to the attention to detail, the humor, and the funny story. A definite 10.",10,6,11,20 July 2014
District 9," Fantastic, original and funny movie
","Saw this today...obviously seeing trailer after trailer and great reviews, I couldn't stand it anymore, so here goes it. A well directed thriller sprinkled with genuine and perfectly timed humor. The movie doesn't take itself seriously, and at point will remind you of robocop...but what a movie! The story line, acting, and the amazing effects will have to glued to your seat. A very simple story with some great plot twists and memorable characters. It's a special movie that doesn't dumb the audience but maintains a creep factor of 10. A well done movie that is unique in so many ways and has a quality about it that seeing it more than once will be the same as seeing it for the first time. Go see it!",10,2,5,16 August 2009
Wreck-It Ralph," Big disappointment
","I am sorry, this film wasn't all that. The fact that I have never heard of any of the video games in the movie made it less appealing to me. The laughs were few and far between, and the ones they tried to do? Juvenile potty humor. It could have been so much better if they would have incorporated more popular video games. Great concept but fell short. Even with all the kids in the audience, there wasn't a lot of laughing going on. The movie tried too hard to be funny. Most of the attempted try at humor was in the trailer. I would recommend taking your child but definitely not an adult themed movie. A very big disappointment.",4,9,35,11 November 2012
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," 2 hours of mad fun!
","Just got back from watching MI..GP...and it was a great 2 hours and some change watching a great action flick! Tom C is great as usual as Ethan, but the movie doesn't work without his team especially Benji (Simon Pegg.) The plot is pretty easy to follow and the action starts from the get go. Director Bird did a great job leaving his mark on the film with several small comedic details. The Dubai part of the movie was amazing...I have no idea why Tom would want to hang around the outside of the Burj Khalifa, but I appreciate him taking us with him, making for something I have never seen on film before. Well done on all fronts...there isn't an 'action movie' award at the Oscars, but if there were? Hands down, MI/GP is the clear winner.",10,3,7,11 January 2012
Get Out," Oh no...no no no...
","OK...rented this online last night...paid 6 dollars to stream in HD...had to see what all the fuss was about...200 million earned world-wide? Has to be great right? Oh no...no no no...this movie has nothing to offer! The movie has a creep factor of 5, but loses its credibility very quickly, as there is no plot, you don't care about the actors, and the ending? Whatever...a typical 'tied up nice and neat' ending. I'm sorry for the horrendous review...I call it like I see it...Get Out? Yeah, get out while you can before you spend any money watching this train wreck...no entertainment value at all. I love Jordan Peete but this one was a miss. I usually don't go out of my way to rip a movie, but this time I am left with no choice. Get OUT!",1,13,24,28 May 2017
Kick-Ass," Excellent Film
","Watched Kick Ass today...wow what an amazing film. A very unique plot and many laugh out loud moments keep you in your seat. The director puts you right there where the action is and keeps the movie flowing. All the characters did a fantastic job!A well done movie all together! There is the high school experience and the family life. Expect the unexpected, and the movie doesn't dumb you down. Superbad meets Kill Bill is an excellent analogy for this movie. It pays homage to every super hero ever and guess what? I have my new superhero! Kick ass definitely can spawn a lot of other movies in the same genre...what genre that is? I am not sure. Go see it...you won't be disappointed.",10,7,21,25 April 2010
The Dark Knight," Watch NOW
","This is just another awesome review of probably the best movie I might have EVER seen! From the incredible action, acting and a really tight plot, this is the movie that well exceeds the hype. You don't even have to like Batman to enjoy this movie. Heath Ledger stole every scene he was in, with an Oscar winning performance...His portrayal of the Joker was absolutely SICK!! You find yourself staring at him during his scenes and wondering how he is doing this!! The Action sequences are absolutely unbelievable...Everyone loves an action flick, and we have all seen the best of them, but the action in this movie tops all others I have seen, (die hard comes to mind)...A deep plot and twists and turns in this movie...Two Face's face!! It's hard to look at! Go see it...it will probably be the highest grossing film EVER...late",10,2,6,27 July 2008
Up," Another Pixar Grand Slam
","Just went to see UP today...was anticipating a Pixar homerun, and yes, they delivered again. Of course there is an obligatory short before the feature, and like all other Pixar movies, the story starts immediately and never stops..All of the characters are impossible to forget, and the story line is pretty good...but the only thing I didn't really like is the corny ending...The pack of dogs steal the show...very original and laugh out loud funny...I didn't see it in 3D, but wish I did. I would highly recommend watching this...",10,2,6,30 May 2009
Mudbound," Slow Burner For a Reason
","Just watched Mudbound last night and I have to say it is a really good movie if you enjoy character development before plot development. In addition, it's always a good idea if directors take the time to dumb movies down for our UK viewers (see above) but us real movie watchers have to suffer. The director here does this masterfully, but unfortunately our UK watcher missed the point of this gem, so please ignore that ridiculous review.During the movie I found myself on IMDb, looking up the characters and had plenty of 'where have I seen this person before?' moments. The movie is a slow burn...just like Mississippi...nobody in a hurry to do anything, anywhere, anytime. Movies with character actors in the lead are always, always going to give you more bang for their buck, because they act their butts off! Rural Mississippi surely is a place I won't be visiting soon. It looks like time stopped down there. Could it be this movie was filmed this year? The way we treat(ed) people of color is truly horrifying. Watch Mr. Banks for an unreal performance as the racist father. Thumbs up to Mudbound.",10,8,21,19 November 2017
There Will Be Blood," Great film making!!!
","Mr. Anderson has scored again! The first 15 minutes is free of any dialog but this funny noise sets up the movie brilliantly!(sounds like a swarm of bees) The opening scene sets up the character and starts us on a journey of greed and tragedy...Mr.Lewis's performance will win the Oscar (if there are any awards this season) hands down. It's not a hard story to follow, and if you are into smash 'em up, shoot 'em up movies, then don't see it...it is a masterpiece of a film, and it follows along with Mr. Anderson's previous work in that the scenes are long, the cinematography is amazing, and he puts you there with his easy going film style. Go see it!",9,0,3,4 February 2008
Inception," To complex to watch once
","There are not too many movies I will pump up like Inception. I have read the reviews here but they still didn't prepare me for an absolutely thrilling film. If you are a fan of Mr. Nolan, which I am, I figured another twisted film, where you have no idea where it's going, but Inception is on another level.I had to watch it twice to figure out the movie. Layers upon layers of plots are in play here and if you miss a SYLLABLE in this movie, you will miss a plot line. The special effects are visionary, and LEO is the ONLY actor I can think of who can hold this movie together. Mr. Nolan, Thank you. I have never seen a movie where you have NO idea if it's a dream or reality. My only question...how in the world can you top this?",10,0,4,5 January 2011
Finding Dory," Laughed Until I Cried
","OK here goes. Saw Dory last night and I have to say it was better than Nemo. Going in, one should know the basic plot, hence the title. Without giving anything away, let me say that Pixar has a way with supplemental characters stealing scenes, and Finding Dory is no exception. The story starts innocently enough, giving us a bit more background on Dory and why she is why she is. The movie moves at a frenetic pace, and while Dory is the main character, her supporting cast is really what steals the show. There are plenty of scenes only Pixar could pull off, and do they ever! The ending scene made me laugh so hard I cried. I have seen every Pixar movie, and never have I laughed until my belly hurt. Dory is hilarious; kudos Pixar!",10,7,31,19 June 2016
The Dark Knight Rises," Breathtaking..Batman satisfies
","Just came back from the theater. I will say from the opening credits to the FANTASTIC ending, Batman is a wild ride! Mr. Nolan delivers an absolutely sizzling finish to his amazing trilogy. The plot isn't as thick as the second installment, so it's very easy to follow, but there are so many characters so you have to pretty much filter through them to pay attention to the relevant ones. It wouldn't hurt also to read up on the story before going in. Having the background story on the bad guy might have helped. Mr. Nolan doesn't let us get away with just sitting there eating popcorn. The movie theater patrons were so quiet...two hours forty minutes flew by. Don't wait for the DVD. This IS why we go to the movies!",10,3,8,21 July 2012
Toy Story 3," Pixar does it again
","I am a 42 year old father of 2 and have seen the last 2 TS movies(and loving them)and knew that the 3rd installment was going to be just as good. This movie exceeded my expectations, and the 3D version was amazing because Pixar didn't present it in the typical '3D poke you in the face to lean back way,' but in a way that made sense and was easy on the eyes. All of our favorites are back, and combined with a variety of new ones who have prominent roles in the plot, make for an excellent story which makes sense if you have seen the last two movies. It's like Woody, Buzz, Rex and Potato head never left, but have been inside a locked toy box and are older(Two characters in particular) and wiser.The lady at the theater ticket counter asked me if the ticket was for me...now I have gray hair and look 42, and I didn't get her point at first, but I can only surmise it's because she wasn't around for the last two and can't appreciate the brilliance of Pixar. In summary,round up the kids, neighbors, and even Grandma and go watch 100 minutes of pure entertainment, with several LAUGH OUT LOUD moments. Even at my age?This movie is AWESOME.",10,3,6,18 June 2010
Godzilla," Muto Love
","Saw MOTU LOVE today and it was amazing. First of all, it had all the classic love story elements to it, but not without some serious flaws. MOTU meets MOTU...they see each other across the ocean. MOTU 1 sends out a FB post for his long lost girlfriend, MOTU 2. MOTU 2 loves the courting period and runs through some serious landscape trying to hook up with her BFF, MOTU 1. When they finally meet, there's a touching moment between the two that will leave you breathless and moist-eyed. In the midst of a MOTU moment, there's this Godzilla character who interjects it's own brand of nonsense into the love triangle. We never get to see Godzilla's character develop, and he comes and goes after ruining MOTU LOVE for good. Go see MOTU love and see if you can find the SUBWAY promo.",8,9,18,17 May 2014
Green Book," Put Your Seatbelt On
","Just watched this gem last night and I was pleasantly surprised at how much I laughed throughout the movie. Viggo and Mahershala provide them in this wonderful movie based on the true life of Tony Vallelonga and Dr. Don Shirley. I wasn't sure what all the hype was about, but I gave it a try and I was absolutely mesmerized by both characters and the way they interacted. Both play off each other brilliantly and again I laughed out loud several times. Viggo should win the Oscar, but wouldn't you know it Mr. Bale is standing in his way. The movie hums along at a nice pace and I couldn't wait for the next scene to unfold. Director Farrelly does it again, this time with two of the most brilliant actors of our time. Green Book is a winner in my book.",10,6,14,13 January 2019
Pineapple Express," Not even close as Apatow's and Rogen's earlier work
","People going to see this movie under the pretense that it will be a laugh a minute ride, will be disappointed. I love all of Apatow's movies and Rogen kicks butt, but besides playing a great stoner by James Franco, this movie doesn't add up to huge laughs... The plot is sticky, way too much overacting by Rogen, and although the very beginning is hilarious, the story strays away from anything solid...hope this helpsIt went on way too long and the ending, well, um, too Hollywoodish and not really a Apatow staple...Wait to the video at Redbox...",4,7,18,3 September 2008
