The King's Speech," A very well-made, well-written, and well-acted historical film
","'The King's Speech' is one of the front-runners in this year's awards races, and now that I have finally watched it, I would say that it certainly deserves that place. It is a movie with epic scope, detailing the transition of the British monarchy in the turbulent second quarter of the past century. Yet it is also a very personal tale of the king- to-be Albert who suffered from a serious stammer, an impediment that would compromise his ability to communicate with his future subjects.At its basic core, The Kings' Speech is the story of the relationship between Albert and his speech therapist Lionel Logue. Logue is not a certified specialist, but only learned his skill through the school of experience. Yet between them, a close (initially testy) bond is forged, which later grew into a true friendship between royalty and commoner.Colin Firth acted perfectly as the beleaguered monarch, with his tics and mannerisms as expected. His role goes from the quiet to the very loud and profane, using Logue's unusual techniques. Geoffrey Rush's acting is more subtle (and likable) here than in his Oscar-winner turn in 'Shine.' He is understated acting as the royal mentor, yet firm and resolute in following his own rules, despite his VIP patient. Both of them deserve their awards consideration. In fact, this may well already be Colin's year to snag that Oscar. Helena Bonham Carter as the King's wife Elizabeth is also getting awards notice, by playing it nice and supportive. I should also mention Jennifer Ehle as Logue's wife Myrtle, especially in my most favorite scene, when she meets the King and Queen for the first time.My one minor quibble is that the actor who played Edward VII (Guy Pearce) looked much younger than Colin. I got confused about their ages for a while during their scenes together, and had to look it up afterwards. I also felt that director Tom Hooper made the grave content of the climactic final speech look and feel secondary to the King's style and success of delivery. Of course, overcoming his stammer is the point of the movie, but hey, he was also delivering his first radio broadcast about the start World War II! There should have been as much emphasis on the sincerity of the message as was given the speech technique.On the surface, it might sound confined and boring, but it is anything but. It is a heartfelt, humorous and very interesting look behind the scenes in a critical transition period in the history of British monarchy. And it is also a very instructive movie for speech therapists and other people who work with patients with disabilities. Do not miss this well-made, well-written, and well-acted historical film.",9,2,4,20 January 2011
Despicable Me 2," Just as Lovable and Funny as Before, But ...
","The first 'Despicable Me' back in 2010 was an unexpected heartwarming surprise for me. I did not think I would like that film because of the strange-looking artwork of the unorthodox characters. But the main story of the film, about how a super-villain named Gru, who wanted to steal the Moon, reformed to become a dedicated family man to three orphaned girls Margo, Edith and Agnes, was its best feature.This story of this sequel is about the reformed Gru (still voiced by Steve Carell) being recruited by the Anti-Villain League to be their secret agent. His mission was to discover and apprehend the evil criminal who had developed a toxin which can turn any being into destructive purple hairy monsters upon injection. While this mission was going on, Gru was also having difficulty admitting his romantic feelings for kooky partner Lucy (Kristen Wiig), as well as trying to break up another romance budding between his eldest daughter Margo (Miranda Cosgrove) and her dashing Latino admirer, who was the son of the man Gru suspects to be the diabolical El Macho.Unfortunately, the story is not really much to be excited too much about this time, unlike the first one which was totally original and endearing. The first film was already perfect as it was as a stand-alone film. I actually thought and even hoped back then that there would be no more sequels to that one. But you know Hollywood, they will try and squeeze out whatever they can from a successful franchise like this one.The star of this film is the colorful and vibrant artwork. We watched this film in 3D and it was awesome and worth the money it cost. The face of Gru himself alone, with that pointy nose of his, is made for 3D. The 3D animation was breath-taking in so many scenes, especially those where there was a speeding submarine underwater, the car hurtling out of the mall window, a jelly fight of epic proportions, an exploding volcano, up to the Minions antics during the final credits. I liked the first film better than this one. This sequel, while still enjoyable, focused more on the relationship between Gru and Lucy. It had little of those delightful encounters between Gru and his daughters which made the first film uniquely appealing. I wanted to see more of cute little Agnes most of all. While she had her little touching moment at the end, it was just too short to make too much of an impact. But definitely, this is one very funny and entertaining film for the whole family. Fans of those naughty little yellow Minions will rejoice as they have practically half of the movie running time dedicated to them, and there are so many more of them here. Fans of good 3D effects will really find this film so cool. I just missed some of the heart that made the first installment more than special.",7,0,1,5 July 2013
Insidious: Chapter 2," MUST Watch Part 1 First To Better Appreciate This Sequel
","This is one of those sequels that really require you to watch the first one in order to enjoy it adequately. I watched the first 'Insidious' when it was released three years ago, and honestly I do not recall much about it. In fact, I did not really like the film that much back then. I read a lot of bad reviews about 'Insidious 2'. I did not feel compelled to watch it. However I noted that three weeks after its local release, there are still a lot of theaters showing 'Insidious 2'. I felt I must have misjudged it since there are still a lot of people watching it up to now.So I decided to watch the first 'Insidious' again before watching 'Insidious 2'. I must say, on second watching I thought the first 'Insidious' was actually the excellent horror movie that it was touted to be back then. I must have watched it when I was not in the mood or something, hence my lukewarm reaction at first. I liked it a lot better this time on re-watching. Then, I went on to watch 'Insidious 2' right away. Lo and behold, I now think this second chapter is actually a very good sequel after all. And this franchise is actually worth all the hype it has.'Insidious 2' actually starts with a flashback to when young Lorraine was consulting young Elise about young Josh's bad dreams. We already know this fact from Part 1. Then after the creepy opening credits, the story picks up from how the story ended in 1, the aftermath of Elise's murder and the possession of Josh by the Bride in Black. Now that Elise is dead, how can the Lambert family get rid of this pesky and increasingly malevolent spirit from tormenting their family?The story will go as you may probably predict already, but there are several twists and turns that will still keep you at the edge of your seats and make you jump. I particularly like the fact that spirits in The Further could do time travel and affect events from the past. Of course, like all time travel devices, there will be plot questions that may arise. However, in this case, I thought this gave it a unique aspect that was very interesting. Ghost hunters Specs and Tucker are still here in Part 2 to provide welcome comic relief, and that was good.Overall, 'Insidious 2,' though now lacking the freshness of ideas from the first 'Insidious,' still manages to give us the jumps and scares we crave for in watching films like this. It will also give us a lot of haunting and disturbing images and moments. Patrick Wilson, Rose Byrne, Barbara Hershey, Lin Shaye and Ty Simpkins all reprise their roles creditably, with additional richer dimensions. James Wan, just fresh from his success with 'The Conjuring' earlier this year, comes up with another winner horror film. Now I understand why 'Insidious 2' has a longer-than-expected shelf life in theaters. I am recommending this for horror film fans, but definitely re-familiarize yourself with the first 'Insidious' film first.",7,0,1,15 October 2013
Moneyball," Baseball + Statistics = ?
","'Moneyball' is about the very American sport of baseball and the objective science of statistics. It recounts how in 2001, ex-ball player Billy Beane, then general manager of the bottom-dwelling and budget-strapped Oakland A's, turned the fortunes of the whole team around by hiring lower-value but talented players based solely on their game statistics. It certainly took a lot of time getting to that main part of the story, but when it got there, you will be rewarded for your patience.Brad Pitt is admittedly too 'movie-starrish' to really disappear into the role of Billy Beane. Put him in a room full of grumpy grizzled old baseball curmudgeons, and he would really stand out like, well, a movie star. While I understand why he is gaining awards recognition for this role, I feel the role may be too understated and underplayed by him. Pitt was effective, yes, but may be too low-key for the big Oscar prize. Beane's 'side-kick' here was Peter Brand (played by pudgy comedian Jonah Hill), a nerdy Yale graduate of Economics who introduced how statistics can be of use to Beane in scouting for players under a limited budget. Hill plays it like he was always in awe of Pitt. On the other side, Philip Seymour Hoffman plays team manager Art Howe, who was disdainful of Beane's radically new scouting style. If he was supposed to be annoying, then Hoffman surely played it that way.I watched 'Moneyball' only because star Brad Pitt has been gaining awards buzz from it, and in fact had won a number of critics awards already. I had absolutely no idea what it was all about before I watched. Even as I was already watching, I had a difficult time getting into the story because it tells about something I am not very familiar with. But give this movie a chance to tell you its story like I did, and you will really get into its spirit and you will like it.",7,0,0,26 December 2011
The Avengers," Finally, a Film that Lives Up to Its Hype and High Expectations!
","The anticipation for this film has been building up so many months since the showing of the solo movies about each of the heroes that comprise this superstar group -- Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, and finally, Captain America. These individual films were all very good on their own, so very expectations are foisted on this special film that would unite all of them in one big adventure. Even though I am out of town now, that did not stop me from catching this film with some Marvel comics geeks. And for once, a film has come that fulfills it's advanced hype, and then some!The film follows how these heroes were called together and assembled by Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D. to retrieve a blue high-energy cube called the Tesseract stolen by the Asgard god Loki. It was fun how the film depicted the clash of their individual big egos of the heroes, and they did not really get along with each other right away, as would be expected. There is humor along with the high-intensity action. I felt though that some 'funny' scenes involving Tony Stark were too self- indulgent for comfort in a 'team' film like this.It was great to see all of these heroes get their fair share of screen time, even the lesser known ones, like the super-archer Hawkeye (the very busy Jeremy Renner) and the amazing fighter Black Widow (stunningly portrayed by the beautiful Scarlett Johansson). The others played their characters as they did in their solo movies, and amazingly, they all worked so well together here: the imperious Thor by Chris Hemsworth, the patriotic Captain America by Chris Evans and the haughty Tony Stark / Iron Man by Robert Downey Jr. People doubted if Marc Ruffalo could take Ed Norton's place as Dr. Bruce Banner and the Hulk, but Ruffalo actually imbued this character with a unique charm previously unseen in other incarnations. The Hulk received the loudest cheers from the crowd! Even the ever-loyal Agent Coulsen (Clark Gregg) gets his moment to shine.This film is a definite must-see not only for all fans of Marvel comics, but for fans of action/fantasy films in general. This is real triumph for director Josh Whedon.  Don't miss the extra scene included in the middle of the final credits for it will surely get you excited.",9,6,13,27 April 2012
Angels & Demons," It Will Make You Want To Read More About It
","'Angels and Demons' is actually my favorite Dan Brown book, more than the more popular 'The Da Vinci Code.' Even when I was just reading A&D, you already get a sense of how cinematic the entire story was. Apart from the obvious travelogue interest in the Rome and Vatican locales where the action takes place, we also get a closer look into the inner workings of the Vatican and the fabled history of the Illuminati.'Angels and Demons' the movie stayed quite loyal to the main storyline of the book. The Pope just died and the Cardinals are in conclave to elect a new Pope. Before that could happen however, a terrorist kidnapped four favored Cardinals and starts to kill them ceremonially in various locations, invoking the Church's historical dispute with the Illuminati. This terrorist does all this while holding the entire Vatican City under threat of annihilation with a powerful anti-matter explosive. The plot, especially the ending, is admittedly very unlikely and highly over-the-top but it makes for a perfect summer blockbuster.For me, the most interesting character in A&D is the enigmatic Camerlengo. He is the priest who is the dead Pope's closest aide and confidante, and who temporarily holds the Papal powers while the new Pope has yet to be elected. I remember I was very fascinated with this character because I have never heard of such a position in the Vatican, even after years of Catholic education. I learned afterward that Dan Brown fictionalized this part as a real Camerlengo should be a Cardinal, an elector and possible candidate for Pope, unlike what was written in the book. The movie makes major changes in the character of this Camerlengo. In the book, his name is Carlo Ventresca, a young Italian priest. In the movie, he becomes Patrick McKenna, a young Irish priest who used to fly military missions against the IRA. I do not know if these modifications were made to fit the actor who played him, Ewan McGregor, or vice versa.Unfortunately, the main debit of the movie for me is still the actor playing the main character, Robert Langdon. Tom Hanks is completely wrong as Robert Langdon. It did not work in DVC, nor did it work here in A&D. The other members of the cast did very well in their roles. Israeli stunner Ayelet Zurer made a very good Vittoria Vetra. She is much better than Audrey Tatou was in DVC. Stellan Skargaard and Armin Muller Stahl were solid and imposing as Commander Richter and Cardinal Strauss respectively. It was a bit of a stretch to imagine Ewan MacGregor as a priest, much less the Camerlengo, but he was not bad at all.So overall, this is a very good and exciting summer movie. Ron Howard did much better in this one than DVC. As before, do not take everything seriously as this is fiction. For those who have not read the book, read it! And later, you will be enticed to research more about Vatican lore, the Papacy, and the Illuminati, as I was, to distinguish what is fact from the fiction.",8,2,4,18 May 2009
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Should Have Just Made One Big Film
","With the first two parts of the Hunger Games films doing so well critically and in the box office, anticipation for the concluding installment was very high. Following the path previously set by the Harry Potter and Twilight Saga franchises, the producers also decided to divide the last book in the series, Mockingjay, into two parts. Now that I have seen the first part, I thought this decision may have been misguided.This film begins right where the previous one stopped where Katniss wakes up in District 13 where she was taken by rebels after she destroyed the Quarter Quell arena with her arrow. Katniss becomes the symbol of the rebellion by appearing in incendiary promotional advertisements, but Katniss was angry with them because they left her partner Peeta behind at the Capitol. Backed with the technical knowhow of Beetee, President Coin of District 13 sends a covert mission led by Gale to rescue Peeta and the other Victors from their captivity. Jennifer Lawrence is far and away the best performer in this film. Her face is really rich in unspoken emotions. Josh Hutcherson gets to flex some of his acting muscles more in this one as the brainwashed Peeta Mellark. It was good to see old characters played by Woody Harrelson, the late Philip Seymour Hoffman, Donald Sutherland, Elizabeth Banks, Liam Hemsworth, Jeffrey Wright and Sam Claflin, though their roles were very limited here. New to the cast, acclaimed actress Julianne Moore is rather one-note in her performance as President Coin. The best moments of this film for me actually had to do with music. The first would be that sublime moment where Katniss sang the haunting tune called 'The Hanging Tree.' The next one would already be during the closing credits when the incredible new song of Lorde 'Yellow Flicker Beat' was played. Overall though, I felt disappointed that this film cannot stand on its own. Unlike the action-packed first two films, this one was just a lot of slow talky scenes which the talented actors cannot do much about to make them any more exciting. That one awesome scene where Katniss shot down a plane with an arrow was even already shown in trailers. No other action sequence matched that one. This whole film clearly served nothing but to just set-up for the big concluding episode to be shown next year. There were a lot of scenes which were unnecessarily prolonged just to pad up the running time. The scenes showing the destruction of District 12 were actually shown twice. The escape to the underground bomb shelter scenes were extended too long. I thought judicious editing could have made these scenes tighter, so that the whole story could have been told in one big spectacular film. Judging from what happened to this one, dividing the last book into two parts may have just succeeded to make the last two films two incomplete films.Anyway as US box office receipts come in making 'Mockingjay Part 1' earn the biggest domestic opening weekend this year ($123M!), I'm sure fans will still all watch this whatever critics and other people say. And definitely, we will all be hanging on for one more year for that explosive Part 2 to come along and blow us away. 5/10.",5,22,36,23 November 2014
Black Swan," Beautiful and Scary at the Same Time
","I am not really a fan of ballet. Ordinarily I would not really catch a film with this setting. However in this case, the Oscar buzz surrounding 'Black Swan' made me want to watch it. So I watched, and I was enthralled by its artistry and repelled by its subject matter at the same time.'Black Swan' tells of Nina, a promising young ballet dancer, who led a very sheltered life shuttling on trains between her ballet and her home with a domineering mother. When she wins the lead role of Swan Queen in an upcoming production of 'Swan Lake,' she begins to mentally unravel in the most disturbing emotional, psychological, and physical (?) breakdown captured on screen. Can she successfully pull off the dance she had dreamed off all her life, or will her demons turn her dreams into a nightmare?We see Natalie Portman like we have never seen her before. She is both very fragile and very daring in her tour de force performance as the rigid and repressed girl obsessed with perfection. Her ballet sequences were very realistic. She was truly a prima ballerina in this production. Not even a hot lesbian love scene could deter her. Her Oscar for Best Actress is clearly within her grasp. Mila Kunis plays Lily, a rival dancer with a contrasting carefree and natural dance style, with so much vitality in contrast with Portman's frigidity. Barbara Hershey plays Nina's mother, whom we could not immediately see as good or bad for her.It is impossible to describe in words this very visual film experience. I would not want to spoil things for you. You will not know which things are real and not. This is NOT just a ballet movie. Amidst the beauty, there is a persistently disturbing and downright scary tone as the movie reaches its climax. You will be hypnotized, but several times you would also want to stop watching the film. The disturbing images will stay with you. Like ballet, this film is also not for everyone, but for me, director Darren Aronofsky has created himself a classic psychological thriller.",8,5,12,2 January 2011
Changeling," Good, But Did Not Know When To Stop!
","A 'changeling' in European folklore is an elf or other enchanted entity that is secretly left in the stead of an abducted child. Director Clint Eastwood takes this legend and applies the name to the 1928 case of Los Angeles woman whose boy went missing one day and another boy was returned to her. Incredible as it may sound, this is supposed to be a true story.Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie) is a single mom working as a supervisor in a telephone service. One day in March 1928 she came home from work to discover her son Walter missing. A few months later, the L.A. police return another boy to her who is clearly not her son. Despite her repeated protests (and I mean REPEATED), the police, specifically Capt. J.J. Jones (sinisterly played by Jeffrey Donovan) do not believe her and even put her in a mental institution! While this was going on, Detective Lester Ybarra (Michael Kelly) stumbles upon a house where grisly murders of boys have been committed. This child murderer Gordon Northcutt (disturbingly played by Jason Butler Harner)would randomly pick up boys on the street, keep them in a chicken coop and mercilessly hacks them to death. An unwilling accomplice confessed to the crimes and identified Walter Collins as among the kids they had abducted.Now for me everything else after this point, I felt the movie lost its focus. Instead of ending it right there, it still went on to depict in detail the murderer's escape to Canada, his capture there, the extensive trials (two simultaneous cases vs. Northcutt, AND vs. the LAPD), his fruitless audience with Christine before his execution and his hanging (complete with his spooky singing of 'Silent Night')! Not being satisfied with that, the movie even fast forwarded to five more years ahead, when a boy suddenly returned and revealed that he was among the kids abducted by Northcutt. He said that he remembered Walter, and that Walter was also able to escape. However, the movie ended with Christine still not being reunited with Walter at all.As a result, the movie really felt very long. There were so many scenes that felt repetitive and unnecessary in the telling of the story. And I have not even mentioned the part of John Malkovich! I felt that Eastwood tried to milk everything out of this story, much to the detriment of the story telling.Fortunately, the acting performance of star Angelina Jolie, upon whom the entire movie hinged, was sincere. She was very good in conveying subtleties of emotions required of her persecuted character. Her very heavy eye and lip make-up may be a bit too distracting at times to the drama, but otherwise, she was spot on. She deserves her Oscar nomination, along with the Academy citations for Art Direction and Cinematography that this film has earned.",6,7,12,29 January 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Pirates Lite
","With 'On Stranger Tides,' the Pirates franchise gets to concentrate more on the character of Capt. Jack Sparrow. Johnny Depp really has this character down pat, and obviously has fun with it. Old characters are still there, such as Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), Gibbs and Jack's father, who are as we know them. But we also get to meet a woman from his past in the person of Angelica, who may or may not be Blackbeard's daughter. Honestly, I thought Penelope Cruz could not possibly be convincing as a pirate, but I was glad to be wrong. She could swashbuckle with the rest of them pirates. While the relationship between Sparrow and Angelica was more on the comedy level, a new romantic pair was also introduced in the characters of the compassionate missionary Philip (Sam Claflin) and the mysterious Syrena (Astrid Berges-Frisbey). While I read a lot of criticism about how useless this angle was to the film, I actually felt the scenes of these new characters were well-executed by new director Rob Marshall. I do not think they bog the storyline down at all.'On Stranger Tides' features a race to the Fountain of Youth which was a great concept. We watched in 3D and I was glad to see that these were not mere post-production effects, and they lasted the whole movie. The 3D was certainly not a rip-off in this one! Those fight and chase scenes in the palace of the mad King George were amazingly shot. The special effects of the pirates encounter with mermaids contribute well to the eerie and menace of those scenes. This was the first Pirates movie that my two boys watched with me. After watching, I felt that indeed this film was the best way to introduce the Pirates to kids. It is shorter, lighter and faster-paced than the first three more 'serious' films, which are more adult in orientation. This is not to mean that 'Tides' is a lesser film quality though. I would think it could launch a trilogy of its own for its new fans.",7,6,8,24 May 2011
Men in Black 3," Josh Brolin Played a Perfect Tommy Lee Jones
","I am not exactly a Will Smith fan. I think the last Will Smith film I watched and liked was the first 'Men in Black' film back in 1997. I was surprised to learn that there will be another installment of 'Men in Black' this year, the third of the series. The second MiB was shown in 2002, and I did not even care to finish that one. Will the ten years between the last episode and this one make a difference? I needed to see that.In this film, a vicious alien villain known as Boris the Animal escapes from his prison on the moon, where he had been locked up since being arrested by Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) back in 1969. One day, Agent K disappears from the present day. His partner Agent J (Will Smith) realizes that K had been assassinated by Boris forty years ago, which caused a major change of events, allowing Boris' alien race to overrun the Earth. J had to find a way to travel back in time to 1969 in order to save K and rectify the tragic consequences of his death. Can J save K and in turn save the Earth from the clutches of Boris?The odd couple was just as they were before in the first films. Will Smith is still his old loudmouth Agent J as Tommy Lee Jones was his tight-lipped Agent K. As J goes back to the past, he will interact with the young 29-year old K, perfectly played by Josh Brolin. Brolin amazingly captures the laconic persona, and even the distinct voice, of Jones so well that they seemed to have been one and the same actor. It was also good to see Emma Thompson again in a major film as she portrayed Agent O, another senior agent with a soft spot for K. The younger Agent O was played by a cutie named Alice Eve, but she certainly did not convince us that she would look or act like Emma Thompson when she grows older.I must say that this film was really a most entertaining one. Well, maybe more for me than for my kids. Younger audiences may find the jokes about 1969 cultural references, such as the hippies, the racial tension, etc., to be a bit difficult to grasp. But the fun action sequences with some exciting futuristic vehicles and weaponry, the imaginative and repulsive aliens made by no less than the master monster-maker Rick Baker, the thrilling integration of the historic Apollo 11 lift-off, and the touching revelation of K's big secret made this a very good and enjoyable movie to watch. 3D did not seem necessary. Director Barry Sonnenfeld got it right this time, and this segment certainly gave perfect closure to the story arc of the whole series.",8,145,183,26 May 2012
Frost_Nixon," Limited Plot but Vibrant Interpretation
","This is the 5th and final Oscar Best Picture nominee that I watched. Honestly, this is the prime reason why I watched this. But, I am glad I watched it because the movie really peaked my interest, and I actually enjoyed it. I totally think 'Frost/Nixon' is worthy of its slot on the Best Picture shortlist.This movie recounts an event in the history of American television broadcast, which was totally unknown to me before I watched this film. This was a celebrated interview of the infamous resigned US President Richard M. Nixon by British talk show host David Frost in 1977. However from this rather limited and shallow plot, British playwright Peter Morgan was able to develop a hit play, and from that this very vibrant screenplay.This is another very potent acting showcase. All of the actors did so well. The two lead stars were the same two who originated these roles in the West End (2006) and on Broadway (2007), and their familiarity with their respective roles shows. All the awards attention is being showered on Frank Langella in his performance as the disgraced Nixon. In fact, he has the lone acting nomination of this film. However, the entire cast should really be recognized as an ensemble.The supporting actors provide a very lively background for which the principal actors perform. I have to give special mention to Oliver Platt and Sam Rockwell for playing Zelnick and Reston, the research staff of David Frost. I enjoyed ALL of their lines. So funny in their sarcasm. Pretty newcomer Rebecca Hall is the only female member of the cast, and she holds her own in her relatively decorative role as Frost's girlfriend Caroline. And who can forget fierce loyalty of Nixon aide Jack Brennan as played by none other than Kevin Bacon.My favorite actor in all this was actually Michael Sheen who played the shallow show-biz oriented British talk show host, David Frost. Sheen, whom I only knew previously as Tony Blair in 'The Queen,' played it light, charismatic and likable as Frost was. He very effectively provided the sharp contrast to the serious and manipulative Nixon, as the script needed to succeed. He should have also been nominated for Best Actor.Frank Langella worked under the disadvantage that he doesn't look like the very recognizable Richard Nixon. He needed to focus our attention on the inner persona and sharp intellect that Nixon is also known for. Mr. Langella slowly won me over from my initial hesitation of accept him at first, and he had me believing in him in the end. The script had emphasized Nixon's apparent greed for money, his sharp strategic mind and also his monumental pride. Yet at the end, he was unexpectedly still able to project humility (something which may not sit well with a lot of anti-Nixon people).Unlike 'Doubt', 'Frost/Nixon' does not betray its theater origin. It was as if it was originally written for the screen. The language of Peter Morgan's script is so alive, evoking both tragedy and humor. This extraordinary writing especially shone in scenes showcasing the British wit of Frost, the mind games of Nixon, and the sarcasm of Frost's advisers. I think the vitality of the script helped the potentially static nature of the plot along and made the directorial job of Ron Howard quite easy.",9,2,5,9 February 2009
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Strange Humor, but poor Kazakhstan!
","This is a very strange, shocking, graphic, offensive movie. Yet, there are various parts that are really very funny. I should not tell you very specific parts because they lose their shock value (which is what this movie is about).My favorite funny parts are in the first half, such as those of Borat's interviews with the humor coach, feminists, the African-American congressman (who made Borat realize what kind of experience he just had with those men he invited into his room), and the dinner with proper Southern family.The most squirmy uncomfortable parts occur in the second half, such as that when he sang the 'Kazakh' national anthem in a Texas rodeo, the antique shop scene, the Christian prayer rally with the politicians, and RV scene with drunk frat boys.If we are to believe that all of these are actual reactions of real people, then the picture painted is really an eye-opener and a mirror for Americans. All I can say is poor Kazakhstan! How was it possible for an American production able to malign a country's name like this???",5,0,3,5 December 2006
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Sherlock Holmes Should Be Treated With More Respect!
","The first 'Sherlock Holmes' movie was an unexpectedly great one. Before I watched that film, I did not think Robert Downey, Jr. could ever be acceptable as Sherlock Holmes. However, after watching that one, I admit that I was mistaken. Therefore, despite the unpromising trailer for this second installment of this franchise, I still went on to watch it, expecting this to exceed the action and humor of the first.However, things did not really go very well in this sequel for me. The process of Holmes anticipating the next moves of his enemies in fights which was so innovative in the first, felt tedious in this one. I felt Guy Richie delved too much into close-ups and slow mo effects, fight scenes and explosions to hide the material deficiency of the script. This movie had more flourish than there was substance. For the actors, only Jude Law for me played his character Dr. Watson as I would expect. Robert Downey, Jr. was NOT Sherlock in most of his scenes! Sherlock would never go drag and almost flirt with Watson the way it was played out here. I did not like it. The gypsy character of Noomi Rapace was quite unnecessary it seemed, just an excuse to have a new female character. The eccentric character of Sherlock's brother Mycroft as played by Stephen Fry was teetering on annoying. The very laid back way Jared Harris played Holmes' arch-enemy Professor Moriarty lacked palpable passion and life opposite Downey's hyper-acting. Overall, except for a well-written cerebral confrontation scene between Holmes and Moriarty towards the end where they verbalized their moves as it be in a chess game, the rest of this sequel was a big disappointment for me. Hints of charm like the first movie were still evident in certain scenes, but the whole was not very satisfying, especially for traditional fans of the Sherlock Holmes books. Making Sherlock overly buffoonish is definitely NOT the way to make him click for this new generation. I think Richie and Downey have got to reassess the way they bring Sherlock to life, if they are thinking of a third installment.",6,1,4,2 January 2012
The Incredible Hulk," Good but I Think It Was Just a Stepping Stone
","I think I am one of the minority who did like the first major Hulk movie by director Ang Lee, starring Eric Bana and Jennifer Connely. Maybe that is why, I did not really think this movie was actually necessary to begin with. I thought Ed Norton did not fit the Bruce Banner role very much. When I watched this, I did not really snap out of my preconceived opinion of the movie. It is not a bad movie, but I still think that this new Hulk movie was not a necessary movie since there was already another good one before.The start is very unusual. The whole origins story is compressed into the opening credits, as if this was already the sequel. If you enter the movie house five minutes after the movie began, you would feel disoriented. What was Bruce Banner doing in the slums of Brazil (man, those are really squalid living conditions there!) and working in a soft drink factory? The actors I felt did not fit their roles. Not only Ed Norton, but also and especially Liv Tyler . She looked awkward in her role as a cell biologist Betty Ross. I also thought they did not have chemistry together. I am biased with the Eric Bana and Jennifer Connelly team-up in the first 'Hulk'.Of course, the CG effects of this new movie was much better than the first. Including the overall scarier and rougher look of the Hulk himself (compared to the smooth green creature in the Ang Lee version). That outdoor scene on the university grounds in broad daylight was very well executed in terms of the details! Congratulations to my cousin Marc, whose name I saw in the final credits as systems coordinator of the Rhythm and Hues crew that created the special effects of this film.There were surprises in the way of cameo appearances. Stan Lee again, this time as the old guy who drinks the gamma contaminated drink. Bill Bixby (TV's Bruce Banner) on an old TV show. And TV Hulk himself Lou Ferrigno as a security guard.Now the very end was another pleasant surprise indeed. However, it also made me feel that this movie was just a stepping stone to the next bigger Marvel project in line. I think that is why this version was done in the first place, so that the Hulk gets a new look and treatment in preparation for the bigger things to come.",5,3,6,8 July 2008
The Monuments Men," Saving the Legacy of Art
","'The Monuments Men' gathers together such a stellar cast, it was definitely hard to ignore. George Clooney directs, writes and plays the lead role in a film that somehow echoes his Danny Ocean films. It was also about gathering a bunch of experts together for a common mission. But this time the mission was not a criminal heist, but something altogether noble and altruistic.In the heat of World War 2, Frank Stokes (George Clooney) wanted to save the precious artwork that the Nazis are spiriting away from various European cities they are attacking. When his mission was approved, he gathered a group of seven experts in the arts together to help him recover these treasures from the clutches of Hitler. These men were not mere bystanders when they went to Europe for their mission. They were actually in the middle of all the risks and dangers of war. George Clooney basically plays himself here, a charming man with a sense of humor and a noble mission in life. It is difficult to disengage him with this Danny Ocean persona, especially since Matt Damon is also on board the team here as James Granger, the curator of the Metropolitan Museum in New York. The chemistry between these two guys was undeniably effortless. The relationship of Damon's Granger with that of Cate Blanchett's Claire (who was the curator of a French museum) though, was rather awkwardly portrayed.Bill Murray plays his usual deadpan droll self as architect Richard Campbell. His mission partner was theater director Preston Savitz, played by Bob Balaban. John Goodman was his usual good guy self as sculpture expert Walter Garfield. His mission partner was French painter Jean Claude Clermont, played by Jean Dujardin. Too bad that we do not really know much more about each of their individual backgrounds and expertise. It would have made us care about them more.For a movie that deals with such an importantly serious topic, George Clooney decides to treat his material with a sense of humor. There would be plenty of funny little one-liners peppered throughout the script, many times diffusing the tension in very intense scenes. I could not help but imagine how it would have been if they had played this film in complete seriousness. This material had the potential to be another war classic and Oscar winner if treated as a drama. That said, the light comedic treatment makes the issue more accessible for younger viewers. There is still pathos that still shine through in many scenes.There were several scenes that may feel extraneous, like Goodman and Dujardin's encounter with an unseen sniper, Damon's unfortunate dilemma when he accidentally stepped on a landmine, or even Murray's scene in the shower while a recording of his daughter singing a Christmas carol was played. These were not necessarily about saving art from the war. But they do complete the picture that these people, despite being there for a special non-military mission, were really still in the thick of the war experience.The message of the film is important. Are works of art worth the cost of human life to preserve them? People who believe that the cultural achievements of humanity should be protected from the destruction of war at all cost, this film will definitely strike a positive chord. Those who believe that art is a mere triviality may think this film is much ado about nothing. I believe they are, and that is why I enjoyed this film very much despite its flaws. 7/10.",7,6,12,12 February 2014
Captain Phillips," On Board With Modern-Day Pirates!
","'Captain Phillips' is the Hollywood retelling of the true-to-life 2009 harrowing story of an American container vessel Maersk Alabama (with Captain Richard Phillips at the helm) being held hostage by Somali pirates. The screenplay by Billy Ray was based on the novel 'A Captain's Duty: Somali Pirates, Navy SEALs, and Dangerous Days at Sea' written by Captain Richard Phillips himself.Playing the titular character, Tom Hanks is what this film is all about. He starts off simply, playing Capt. Phillips as a family man and seasoned seaman on a routine delivery. However when the pirates came, you see him transform into a cool-under-pressure leader and shrewd tactician, matching wits with these desperate aggressors. In the last five minutes, Hanks would give us an unexpected display of emotion which may well deliver him another Oscar for Best Actor.The four Somali-American first-time actors playing the pirates are a very realistic bunch. They play with wild-eyed and feral intensity, really scary. Barkhad Abdi plays their skinny foolhardy leader Muse, engaging Phillips in a deadly chess game, toe-to-toe. Faysal Ahmed plays the hot-headed Najee, who was the loose cannon of the group. Barkhad Abdirahman plays the young recruit Bilal, getting himself a baptism of fire on his first time out. When I saw the name director Paul Greengrass in the credits, I understood why the sense of tension and urgency were so well-conveyed. This was that familiar sense of excitement we felt in his previous films, like the last two Jason Bourne films or that suspenseful 9/11 drama 'United 93'. He really knows how to make military operations exciting on screen, as he did for the Army in 'Green Zone' and the Navy SEALS in this film.I have to admit I was on the verge of getting seasick with the shakiness of the camera, but luckily I held on despite the two-hour length of the film set at sea.Overall, this is a different sort of adventure drama, with a topic not too commonly tackled in a mainstream film. We hear of these events on the news, but this film brings us right in the middle of one. We will feel the tension building as the pirates were approaching. We will feel the fear when the pirates were on board. We will feel the desperation and the frustration of being trapped in the middle of the open ocean with no help immediately forthcoming. If you are up for such a realistic experience, then this film is for you.",7,78,121,14 October 2013
Sucker Punch," I Don't Why People Hated This Film-- It's Good!
","I am glad I did not simply fall for the bad reviews against this film 'Sucker Punch.' Actually there was unbelievable hype going for this Zach Snyder film building up to its theater debut. However, as the movie opened, bad reviews unexpectedly started to pour in about how bad it was! I almost was not able to watch at all in the movie house, until this week. And I am glad that I did catch it. While it may seem that the target may be the young male audiences because of its cool look, sexy girls, big weapons and violent scenes, the deeper message of the entire movie would seem to target the young females. The film exhorts young women to stand their ground and fight for their rights. However, it also sends the not-so-subtle message to these young ladies that this would not be an easy task in this world, as our heroines needed to escape into their dreams in order to escape their harsh realities in a world of bad men.This type of movie has to be seen in the big screen to appreciate its full effect. The CGI is awesomely executed in that cool anime style to bring us to diverse locales, from asylum to brothel to Oriental temples to WWI trenches. There is even a fire-breathing dragon in there somewhere. While the female leads are young, pretty and sexy, although acting may not really be their top suits. The plot is very intricate where there are multiple layers of reality and fantasy which involve many characters, so much so that the ending is very open for interpretation. I do not know exactly why people hated this film. I think it does its job very well. It is actually quite entertaining and delivered in a very artistic cinematic style.",7,4,11,8 April 2011
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Unnecessarily Prolonged, Hilariously Cheesy
","I stopped reading the Twilight books after 'Eclipse.' That book bored me to death and terminated any interest of reading the last book, 'Breaking Dawn.' We went to watch 'Breaking Dawn, Part 1' just tonight because my wife really looking forward to it. I was grateful that I had not read the book, because curiosity about how the story would turn out was the only thing that kept me watching.The entire sequence from their wedding in the woods to their honeymoon in Brazil was maybe 45 minutes too long. They could have cut and compressed all of that hilariously cheesy stuff and maybe 'Breaking Dawn' could have only been one movie, instead of two parts. As with the first three books, Bella continues to row her boat between the two rivers. Yes, even after her wedding to Edward, she continues to flirt with Jacob! Yet these two guys remain incredibly and illogically loyal to her. Anyhow, that was what Stephenie Meyer wrote, so fans of the book will be expecting that.The part about Bella's baby and how it was born was at least suspenseful. But this part only started maybe in the last 30 minutes of the whole film. The fight scenes with the wolves and vampires were too close-up to be clearly exciting. The medical aspects of the C-section were not to be taken seriously. The artificially white faces of the vampires especially on Carlisle and Emmett were awfully distracting. However, the make-up and special visual effects on Bella's look during the pregnancy were realistically eerie. Jacob's imprinting scene was also well-executed.Kristin Stewart was as bland as ever as Bella. Robert Pattinson was as cheesy as ever as Edward. Taylor Lautner does a bit better as Jacob, maybe because of how nobly his character had been written. Most of the other supporting characters, human, vampire and werewolf get a line or two. Memorable one-liners from Billy Burke as Bella's dad Charlie, and Anna Kendrick as Bella's friend Jessica before and during the wedding, made me laugh out loud.This movie is strictly for the entertainment of Twilight fans who will love it. It is up to par and keeps the spirit well with the rest of the other Twilight films. For non-Twilight fans who haven't read the book though, at least this installment does manage to keep your interest. I have no idea what else is left for Part 2 to tell. It felt like they could have ended the franchise with this one already since the love story seems to have been settled, if not only for financial considerations. My wife will see this whole film differently though. Hehe.",5,8,14,19 November 2011
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," People Will Identify With This Film At Many Levels
","'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' brings us back to the early 1990s, telling us the story of a smart but problematic high school freshman, Charlie (Logan Lerman). His spends his days simply avoiding everyone else, until he was accepted by seniors/half-siblings, Patrick (Ezra Miller) and Sam (Emma Watson) into their circle of oddball friends.With them, Charlie is drawn into the teen experience and actually gets to do things which up to then he had only been a viewer from the sidelines. With Sam, Charlie experiences his first love, but of course, as films like this go, it will not be as simple as that.Logan Lerman does a redux of his role as Percy Jackson, a troubled teenager. However, this time he is a normal human being, not a son of Poseidon. This guy can really turn on the angst. He reminded me of a young John Cusack of the 80s or Paul Rudd of the 90s. In fact, since Paul Rudd plays Charlie's favorite teacher, their conversations looked like Paul talking to his younger self. Being some sort of a teenage wallflower myself back in the day, I can feel his pain. This is one very sensitive actor, and I look forward to more movies of this guy.Emma Watson, we were all excited to see graduate from her days as Hermione Granger. And she certainly does here, playing a girl who had been taken advantage of by men and boys with she had relationships in the past and even the present. You can really feel why Charlie got attracted to her free spirit, yet unable to express how he really feels for her. Emma fulfills the promise she had as an actress who grew up in front of all of us. She will be a force to reckon with in awards seasons to come.Watching this as an adult and a parent now, I wonder how the experience will be for my kids growing up into their own teen years. Watching Dylan McDermott and Kate Walsh play Charlie's parents, not knowing why their precious son behaved that way he did. It gives us pause to know our own kids more, and hope that they do not keep major life-altering secrets from us. More than the scenes at school, I enjoyed the scenes about their togetherness as a family. I liked the scenes where siblings took time to talk and relate to each other, knowing when one needed help. There are many tiny lessons here and there in this film which viewers can get life lessons from. I can imagine so many people identify with this movie on various levels.",8,4,9,2 October 2012
The Equalizer," Good, But More of the Same
","This film is based so loosely from the 1980s TV series starring Edward Woodward as Robert McCall, an ex-agent who helped poor individuals who have no one else to turn to in their crime-related problems. But the McCall (Denzel Washington) is here no dapper English gentleman, but he is a genial quiet employee of a Home Depot-type warehouse store who kept pretty much to himself. One day, he meets and befriends a teenage prostitute Alina (Chloe Grace Moretz) at his usual dining place. When she had been beaten up by the Russian mobsters who handled her, McCall gets shaken out of his neat little routines, and an unparalleled killer of immeasurable means gets unleashed to champion the cause of the helpless masses.This is another oft-told tale in Hollywood these days, an ex-CIA agent with superhuman abilities saving the day for some damsel in distress. This year alone, we have seen it in 'A Walk Among the Gravestones' with Liam Neeson, and 'November Man' with Pierce Brosnan. With 'The Equalizer' though, we are given Denzel Washington in the lead role, by the same man who directed him to his Best Actor Oscar, Antonio Fuqua.The action sequences are well-planned and orchestrated, but I can't really say they are all that original. They are of extraordinary violence and gore, I'd give them that, hence the local R-16 rating. The whole 'seeing small details around him while planning an attack' routine has been done before, and with much more logic, in the Sherlock Holmes films. The whole climactic 'walking away from a series of big fiery explosions behind the hero' gimmick is practically a staple in countless A, B or C level action films before this one.The best scene in the whole film was probably the one where McCall talks face-to-face with the vicious Russian gang leader, Teddy (Marton Csokas). That scene was one big mind game where McCall exposes the weaknesses of his enemy using mere words. That was an exciting psy battle of wits at its best, better than all the shootouts and explosions in the film. For me, Denzel Washington did not look like he had the right physical look to realistically convince me that he could do the stunts McCall was doing. However, in these intense face-to-face confrontation scenes, you know he is the type who could psych you out crazy even with his penetrating stare alone. This is what gives 'The Equalizer' an edge over all the other run-of-the-mill action thrillers with the same basic story. 6/10.",6,6,11,6 October 2014
Source Code," 8 Minutes to Save the World
","Capt. Colter Stevens (Jake Gylenhaal) wakes up in a Chicago train, not knowing anyone around him, even the pretty girl (Michelle Monaghan) in front of him who seems to know him. After a few minutes, we are all shocked when this train blows up into flames! Cut to the next scene where we see Capt. Stevens in a cramped little capsule speaking to a controller (Vera Farmiga) on a TV monitor. Then we see the incredible mission that Capt. Stevens was actually on, and from there, we the audience gets a smart, thrilling, dramatic and romantic ride all the way to the end.OK, at the start, the film was very repetitive (ala 'Groundhog Day'). However when the film hits its drift, it doesn't let up. The science fiction aspect is unbelievable, but they make it actually sound plausible. Jake Gylenhaal does it again in creating a character you will definitely root for to complete his unprecedented mission. Stevens' touching phone call towards the end is an acting highlight. The final ten minutes still manages to spin the film around, which can be good or bad depending on the person watching. Thinking about the fate of Vera Farmiga's character can give rise to a lot of plot questions.When I first saw the poster of 'Source Code,' it did not make me want to see it. It looked like just another generic explosive summer action film. The title sounded very lame as well. However, when it debuted in theaters last week, the reviews were consistently very good. I am glad that I gave it chance. It was a very good movie indeed.",8,1,4,6 April 2011
Skyfall," Simple Revenge Plot Improved by Cinematography and Acting
","'Casino Royale' established a new kind of James Bond in Daniel Craig and his gruff and rough portrayal of the usual suave and cool Bond. 'Skyfall' continues to mine this new James Bond persona, as we actually see a James Bond emotional enough to shed tears. I am getting ahead of myself.The title 'Skyfall' refers to the old Bond estate in the Scottish highlands where James' parents Andrew and Monique Bond were buried. This estate was the site where the climactic booby trap and shotgun battle between Bond and the bad guys took place.The plot of this movie started from a stolen list of MI6 agents which devolved into a story of revenge of Silva (Javier Bardem in another crazy eccentric character reminiscent of his 'No Country for Old Men' performance), also a former MI6 agent, who wants to kill M (Judi Dench) for betraying him. Ever loyal Bond, of course, does all he can to save his boss, despite being betrayed himself.Despite the very basic plot, the good thing about this Bond movie is the breathtaking cinematography by Roger Deakins. I echo other critics in finding this probably the best shot of all the James Bond films. Having Oscar winning director Sam Mendes at the helm, the dramatic trajectory of the story is built up perfectly. As the 50th anniversary presentation of this spy franchise, homages to Bond lore abound throughout the film, from the classic theme song to the classic Aston Martin.I felt the simple revenge story line was stretched too long for comfort maybe by an hour. The entire Macau scenes, including the Komodo dragons and Bond girl Severine, could all have been excised without really affecting the basic story. However, the amazing cinematography highlighting the best of the exotic locales, the editing of the fantastic action sequences involving trains and the evocative dramatic performances of Daniel Craig and Judi Dench make this still a compelling Bond movie overall. That said, I still say Craig's Bond is NOT the Bond we knew 50 years ago.",7,1,12,13 November 2012
The Young Victoria," Beautiful Film, but Could Have Spent More Time to Flesh Out the Characters
","As I had always written in previous reviews, I am very fond of watching historical films. When I saw this on the list of Qantas flight home from Sydney yesterday, this was the very first one I watched.This film tells the story of Victoria from the days prior to and during the early days of her being a queen. Apart from the political intrigues surrounding her ascendancy to the throne, the film also shows us her love story with Prince Albert. As the film covered a lot of time, I felt that the story-telling was rushed through. You just get the main story, but not enough development of characters and exposition of their motivations.Some characters are clearly villainous like Victoria's mother, the Duchess of Kent (Miranda Richardson), and her nasty adviser Sir John Conroy (Mark Strong). However, the character of Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany) was of nebulous motivations. The character of King William was very well played by the unrecognizable Jim Broadbent, but I had never actually seen a king address his enemy so scandalously on a banquet table! As expected, there was beautiful cinematography, as well as very colorful period costumes and elaborate set designs. The acting of Emily Blunt (whom I only knew from 'The Devil Wears Prada')as the young Victoria and of Rupert Friend (whom I never saw before) as her consort are very lively and strong. Their scenes together were the best parts of the movie. But again, the hastily edited final sequences and the abrupt ending left me unsatisfied. I was expecting more. (However, I did sit through the beautifully haunting song sung over the closing credits.)",6,3,6,19 October 2009
The Hangover," Madcap Zany Fun Movie
","I did not really plan to watch this movie because I am not the type of guy who enjoys drinking alcohol. The poster was strange and the stars were unknowns. First impression was: Not Interested. However, the news came that this flick actually topped the summer box office Stateside. I heard a couple of radio DJs talk about how funny and cleverly plotted it was. I had some time to kill, so I was able to watch it.'The Hangover' is about a stag party in Vegas which goes totally haywire. When they wake up wasted the next morning, their suite was thrashed, one finds that he has lost a tooth, there's a tiger in the bathroom, there's a baby in the closet, and worst of all, the groom is nowhere to be found. The three groomsmen needed to retrace the obviously wild night they had to find their friend and get him to the wedding on time.It was very funny how the director went on to steer the audience into realizing what happened together with the characters, as we follow them through their madcap misadventures. As this is a movie, realism is thrown out of the window and our IQ should be checked at the door. You simply know those situations are out of this world, but it grabs our attention as we too want to know exactly what happened. There were potentially offensive subjects like police brutality and Asian racism, but we know these were done tongue-in-cheek, so we go along with the fun ride.I have not seen these actors before. They are really the unlikeliest of gangs. I do not think people like them would flock together in real life. Bradley Cooper plays the mean alpha male. Ed Helms plays the nerdy straight-laced dentist. Zach Galifianakis plays the weirdo brother of the bride. Justin Bartha plays the groom. Their chemistry with each other and willingness to make fun of themselves adds to the success of this film.",7,4,8,14 August 2009
Iron Man 3," Too Much Hype Can Disappoint You
","First comment, the rating. In our country, this film is rated G. However, a scene that suggests a man's head was shot and the drugged prostitutes in a Miami mansion are hardly general patronage. This is PG-13 at best. Anyway, back to the movie. The hype and anticipation for this movie was incredible. The biggest chain of malls in this country had every single one of its movie theaters showing this film! Admittedly this made expectations for this movie to be as high as 'The Avengers' last year. 'The Avengers' made good on that hype, but 'Iron Man 3' did not.The plot centers around Iron Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and his conflict with a mad scientist named Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce), who has developed a powerful virus called Extremis who can give fiery powers to those who can withstand its painful incubation. At the same time, the President of the United States was abducted by a mad international terrorist who calls himself 'Mandarin' (Ben Kingsley). When the Stark cliffside mansion was destroyed, his love Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow) was abducted and his Iron Man suit severely damaged, Stark has to rely on his own cunning, his good friend Rhodes (Don Cheadle) and geeky boy from Tennessee (Ty Simpkins), to control his panic attacks, get his armor fixed and flying, in order to save the President and save Pepper too.The action sequences were all very masterfully executed. I enjoyed the unbelievable 'Barrel of Monkeys' sequence in the sky among people sucked out of Air Force One. Of course, the explosive and fiery finale on the waterfront was really awesome, with all those powerful incandescent Extremis soldiers and all those Iron Man suits we see in the commercials. I just felt though that the talky sequences between these action scenes are too prolonged and could be boring even. I even felt that Ben Kingsley was undeservedly wasted in the role given him. The comedic one-liners were not too funny, but the physical comedy parts by Downey were much better and funnier.I thought this film was 70% Stark, only 30% Iron Man. I felt this film was too long and could be edited to tighten the suspense and streamline the storytelling more. The ending sequence was nicely ambiguous. The extra scene after the very long closing credits was funny with a surprising cameo appearance, but it was not so exciting to suggest what the next Marvel film was all about. (Or does it?) Overall, 'Iron Man 3' was just alright, but not really worth all the hype given it. Temper your expectations.",6,23,50,25 April 2013
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," A Very ORIGINAL Film!
","This movie's poster came out quite early on this year, and I was really very intrigued by it. The title and concept are really so far-out-of- this-world original, I can't wait to see how this story would unfold. After a long wait, how timely was it that a movie about a great American president(albeit an action-horror-fantasy one) would be shown right on the 4th of July where I am? Cool, huh?The film opens with Abraham Lincoln on a voice-over talking about how History prefers legends to men, then flashes back to his childhood when young Abe witnesses his mother being killed by what seemed to be a vampire. The desire to seek vengeance on the ghoulish murderer would carry him over the next years as the child grew up. After a botched attempt, he meets a vampire-killer named Henry Sturgess (Dominic Cooper) who trains him in the killing craft using his weapon of choice, the axe. From there, this fantastic back story would then intertwine with more historically-familiar events we knew about Abe Lincoln, like his marriage to Mary Todd, his rise to the Presidency, the Emancipation Proclamation, the Civil War, the Gettysburg Address and his fateful date at the theater. This is practically everything the layman knows about Abe Lincoln. Even viewers with only a passing knowledge of American history can readily relate. You simply have to watch to see how they dovetail the fantasy parts into the history parts.I must say that this movie more than lives up to the high expectations I had of it. OK, the stylized violence may not sit well with all audiences, but for me everything just fit in so well. The writing by the book's author himself, Seth Grahame-Smith, was excellent. I really congratulate him for his awesomely radical idea. It was so crazy it just had to work!The story treatment by the director (whose name I have never heard of before), Timur Bekmambetov, had just the right touch of tongue-in-cheek humor to balance out the gore and make the whole thing work without being overly cheesy (like the 'Twilight' films). I have never seen scenes like that fight atop the stampeding horses, or those sieges at Gettysburg, among so many other visionary scenes executions throughout the film. Those were really amazingly triumphant visual effects! They have succeeded to make a bona-fide American hero even larger-than-life and more noble than he was already known for. As far as the actors are concerned, there were no really big stars here. Only Dominic Cooper was the familiar face, and he did really well as Abe's mentor Henry. At the start I had a small problem with the lead star Benjamin Walker as I did not really believe him to be Abraham Lincoln as a young man. He simply did not seem correct as the young Abe the way he looked and acted. This situation was of course corrected when the wonders of make-up came in when he was already President. I really believe the Make-up of this movie deserves an Oscar nomination at least as it really transformed Walker into the Abraham Lincoln we all expected. This was my one minor gripe about the film although later in my overall appreciation of the movie, Walker's seeming physical disconnect as Lincoln did not really matter after all in the end.I highly recommend this movie to true vampire fans and history fans alike. As odd as that combination is, I am sure there are plenty of us out there.",9,4,8,5 July 2012
If I Stay," A Cello Runs Through It
","The cello is my favorite musical instrument. One of my favorite movies of all time is the Japanese Oscar Best Foreign Language film winner 'Departures' and a cello played a prominent part in that one. 'If I Stay' is another film in which a cello takes center stage, and I would not miss it even for that reason alone.'If I Stay' is a dramatic film about a shy cello-playing teenager named Mia Hall. She has cool supportive parents, who were once in the punk scene. Her boyfriend Adam is the front man of an up-and-coming rock band. Everything seemed to be going swimmingly with her. She is awaiting for her acceptance letter from the Julliard School. Then one beautiful winter day, a tragic car accident happens.I was looking forward to good cello music, and it did not disappoint. Those music in those scenes showing Mia auditioning for Julliard were breathtaking. As it turns out though, the cello music is not the only thing good about this film.This film is a tearjerker of the highest order. The script was written in very emotional language by Shauna Cross based on a best-selling novel by Gayle Forman. Thankfully, the cast, though mostly unknown except for the lead actress, does very well in bringing this script to life.Chloe Grace Moretz is really a phenomenal young actress. She gained attention as the ultra-violent It Girl, the best part of the 'Kick Ass' films. Now a little more grown-up as Mia, Moretz provides this role the grace and elegance. A lesser actress may have made those death scenes mawkish and those romance scenes cheesy. Those cello-playing scenes were killer scenes.Jamie Blackley was fine as Mia's boyfriend Adam. He seemed uncomfortable at times, and his chemistry with Moretz was not entirely convincing. I like the actors who played Mia's parents Denny and Kat better, Joshua Leonard and Mireille Enos. That New Year's Day scene where Kat was drying the dishes while Mia washed was especially well-written and well- acted out. I had seen Liana Liberato in her devastating film debut as a victim of child rape in 'Truth.' She also did well her as Mia's loyal friend Kim. I think this is the first time I have seen perennial bad guy Stacy Keach in a role that made him so emotionally raw as Mia's grandfather.The storytelling, with its weaving in and out of past and present events, was very well-edited. However, the pace taken by Director RJ Custer can feel very slow and repetitive at certain times in the middle, which made me look at my watch a few times. Overall though, it was effective in its intention as a tear-jerking romance. Your handkerchief or tissue paper will definitely get wet with this film with its many touching scenes.",7,23,38,4 September 2014
In Bruges," It's an Excellent Drama with Some Funny Lines
","Thank God for awards seasons or else low profile yet note-worthy films like 'In Bruges' would never have made my list of movies to watch. I first read about it as one of the Top 10 films of 2008 in about.com, together with all five eventual Oscar Best Picture nominees. Then in the Golden Globes, both lead actors Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson netted nominations for Best Actor in a Comedy. Colin Farrell won his first Globe here. From then on, I knew I had to watch this.You may wonder why I put 'Drama' as the Genre above, instead of Comedy like the Golden Globes did. Well, it is simply because I did not think this was a comedy AT ALL! The plot follows two hit men sent to the medieval town of Bruges in Belgium to hide out after a messy assignment. The main conflicts and resolution of the story are hardly a laughing matter. Very serious issues of guilt and death are tackled here, with some very violent scenes.Certainly, there are some really funny episodes and witty lines of dialogue interspersed within that main storyline. But for me, these ironic scenes and words do not a comedy make, even if that were the intention of the writer and director Martin McDonagh. Of course, this, I would not really know.The interaction of Farrell and Gleeson was flawless. They both deserved to be nominated, yet the victory of one over the other is debatable. Farrell played the younger guy Ray who carries with him the weight of a tragic miscalculation. Gleeson is his jaded senior Ken who has already learned to find the good in bad situations. Ralph Fiennes adds to the mix with a startling performance as their malevolent boss Harry, who has a weird misplaced sense of honor.More interesting color is added to the film by the various flawed characters the two meet in Bruges. Despite the number of these people in the sidelines, each one plays an important role in the story and film never loses its focus. I have to mention here the very pretty love interest Chloe (Clemence Poesy) and the midget actor Jimmy (Jordan Prentice) for putting in some memorable quality screen time and dialogue.Although excellent, this may not be a film for everyone. The violent scenes can be quite bloody. There are several lines that may offend midgets, blacks and Belgians, but I guess that is where most of the black humor lay. In addition, I appreciated the fact that I watched a copy with good subtitles since the Irish brogue can get difficult to understand. And, like Ken, I do like the look, history and ambiance of Bruges, and I would like to visit that place sometime in the future.",8,1,3,11 April 2009
John Wick," Keanu's Back with a Vengeance
","The career of Keanu Reeves seemed to have taken a nosedive after the success of the Matrix films. We would be hard put to name even one film after that. Last year, he directed a martial arts film called Man of Tai Chi, where he played antagonist to a less than charismatic leading man. That did not fly too high, except perhaps for some hardcore action fans. For this year though, the buzz for this film 'John Wick' was simply too high to ignore. The plot is ripped off the plots of many other old-fashioned action films, especially those from the 1980s. JOhn Wick is a retired hit man. He is still very depressed about his wife's death. One day, a group of thugs break into John's house and destroy his wife's one most precious gift to him. John finds out the perpetrator Iosef is the crazy spoiled son of his old boss, Viggo. John then goes on a deadly revenge rampage until no one is left alive.Yes, there is not much about that script to be excited about. However, for their first directorial effort, David Leitch and Chad Stahelski, the stunt coordinators for Keanu Reeves in 'Matrix', make a spectacular debut. Their action sequences were fast-clipped, very exciting and relentlessly brutal. Be it gunplay, knife-play or martial arts, Keanu Reeves made a perfect action hero.A lot of this film's success also comes because of Reeves' excellence in dramatic acting. Okay, so there only few of those moments. We will remember fondly his devotion to his wife, which Reeves was able to project very well without words. He was sincerely in those touching scenes.",7,6,17,4 November 2014
Kung Fu Panda," The Best Animated Feature in the Past 2 Years !!!
","I LOVED this movie!!!! I even daresay that this is the best animated motion picture I have seen since 'Cars' two years ago. Although the whole story of an underdog turned champion is admittedly an oft-told retread, the treatment is original and amazing and very engaging, and not corny (unlike a lot of the recent animated films). I cannot stop singing praises to this one. The artwork of the whole movie is fantastically rendered, no exquisite detail was spared in the scenery, the architecture and of course, the lead animal characters.The action and fight scenes are very well done and memorable. I enjoyed watching the fight scene between Po and Shifu for the last dumpling, the fight of the Five vs. Tai Lung at the Bridge, and the climactic fight scene of Tai Lung with Shifu, and then with Po. Very exciting. My daughter even spontaneously applauded after that last fight sequence.There were also a number of beautifully-crafted emotional moments throughout. I loved the inspirational talk of Master Oogwei and Po (loved those words of wisdom), the talk of Master Oogwei and Shifu with the peach blossom petals, and of course the touching moment of Po and Shifu after the battle, and even in that small extra scene after the credits.The voice acting was also very good. Jack Black as Po, so natural the comedian, wow. Dustin Hoffman as Shifu, really great. I did not expect it to be him. If was fun to discover after the movie that is was Angelina Jolie who voiced the Tigress, Lucy Liu, the Viper, and Jackie Chan, the Monkey, among others. And even more minor characters like the menacing head of prison security rhino Commander Vachir voiced by Michael Clarke Duncan, all very good.Overall, a fantastic movie experience that I would not mind watching over and over. There is something for everyone -- action, drama, and comedy. It is an animated classic in my book. Very highly recommended indeed!",10,11,13,8 June 2008
Gravity," One Incredible Lost-in-Space Adventure
","'Gravity' tells of the unenviable situation experienced by medical researcher Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) and her astronaut mission leader Matt Kowalski )George Clooney) when an accidental disaster caused by a shower of satellite debris destroys their space station and leaves them floating in deep space.Director Alfonso Cuaron has created a masterpiece that knows when to move for excitement and when to stop for meditation. We enjoy the breathtaking ride through the dangerous outer frontiers. We also get to look inwards to the essence of our own minuscule humanity in stark contrast to the vastness of the universe. We will feel agoraphobia and claustrophobia at the same time while Stone and Kowalski struggle to keep themselves alive.'Gravity' is not much of a story to be told by mere words, but a story that needs to be experienced best via the medium of film, and all its modern abilities. This film employs the best of cinematographic technique (Emmanuel Lubezki), editing efficiency (Cuaron himself and Mark Sanger), top-of-the-line 3D visual and eerie sound effects to re-create the harshness of outer space. The musical score by Stephen Price can be both soaring and quiet when the scene called for it. I truly see ALL the technical Oscars going to this fantastic technical team.There maybe some scientific principles amiss as some incredible coincidences arise to move the story forward. However, we so care so much for our two characters that these minor details done in the name of artistic license can be overlooked with no big deal. The film successfully makes us feel emotionally connected with them. We are out there with them and we want to escape this scary and hopeless situation with them.Sandra Bullock comes up with a precious performance of a lonely person desperately confronting the biggest fears of her life in the bleakest of situations ever. Her range of emotions ran the gamut from fearful despair to hopeful determination. She is front, center and everything this movie is about. She did not lose her sense of humor when we also needed it. This has got to be a Best Actress performance of the highest merit. Supporting Bullock is George Clooney as that believable voice of calm and reassurance we all need. With him there, Ryan felt she can overcome any adversity she faced. His wit and charm carried Ryan through her ordeal, and this was palpable enough to carry the whole audience along the ride with her.'Gravity' might as well be declared the Best Picture of this award season already. As of now, it can already be considered a lock for the big prize because of its audacity of scope, its technical excellence, its memorable performances, and above all, its images full of artistry and symbolism. 10/10.",10,5,11,5 October 2013
Lone Survivor," Patriotism and Pashtunwali
","The operation of Navy Seals in Taliban country in the mountains of Afghanistan go awry. And as the title already tells us quite obviously, there is only one lone survivor. However, before it reaches that inevitable conclusion, we will be brought right in the middle of the action where bullets fly and bombs explode. You will definitely flinch as director Peter Berg does not shirk from showing in stark graphic close-ups how bullets and shrapnel hit their targets, drawing blood and ultimately death. We will also bear witness to a 2000 year old code of honor among Afghan villagers called Pashtunwali where undertake the responsibility of protecting an individual at all costs. This is something new I have never known before and is heartening to learn about.Honor and valor comes in different forms from different people. We see a lot of it here in 'Lone Survivor.' The Seals (played by Mark Wahlberg, Taylor Kitsch, Ben Foster, Emile Hirsch) show it. The Afghan villagers (played by Ali Suliman and Rohan Chand) show it even better.You will really get into the horrific experience of being in the battle zone. This will make you admire and appreciate these brave men who do their unenviable duties in the face of death out of sheer patriotism. This is brutally frank war movie, not for the faint at heart. 8/10.",8,5,16,4 January 2014
Star Trek," Superlative Movie - And That's No Hyperbole!
","I am definitely giving this movie a ten star rating. I'd give it more if I could. This is the best movie I have seen so far this year! I am not a serious Trekkie by any means. I know the members of the crew of the Original Series, but not with too much familiarity. But for a casual Star Trek fan like me, this prequel is really excellent! Excellent story. Excellent casting. Excellent technicals. Excellent execution.The film begins with the birth of James Tiberius Kirk and it never lets up on the drama, the action, the science fiction, no holds barred. There is heavy drama even before the credits. (My wife already was teary-eyed by the end of that sequence!) Even when the story grapples with time travel, warps and black holes, you never get lost with the flow. The logic is always there. None of the usual plot holes that beset stories that deal with time.I really have to complement the casting director. The new cast is amazing in its portrayal of the crew which millions of fans know and loved over the years. They have collectively succeeded in recapturing the spirit and character of the individual Enterprise crew members as young cadets. Kudos to Chris Pine as J.T. Kirk and Zachary Quinto as Mr. Spock. They really possess the essence of the characters, and the evolution of their friendship is very believable as portrayed. Apart from John Cho (as Sulu), the other actors are not really known to me, and this is an additional plus. The guy who played the young Dr. McCoy (Karl Urban) also did very well, as with the guy who played Scotty (Simon Pegg).I congratulate the director J. J. Abrams for this bold visual spectacle that went well beyond my expectations. I went in the movie house with very high expectations due to the very positive word of mouth. I was definitely NOT disappointed. I exhort all of you to watch this movie on the big screen as it deserves to be watched. I think this movie would be a classic the appeal of which will never fade even after repeated viewings.",10,4,14,12 May 2009
Train to Busan," More Than Just a Zombie Film
","This new Korean film 'Train to Busan' is certainly earning a lot of positive word of mouth and box office success since its debut in the Midnight Screenings section of this year's Cannes Film Festival.The central character is Seok-woo, a man stressed out with problems about his investments business and his divorce. His 9-year old daughter Su-an, feeling neglected, requests her father to bring her to Busan the next day to see her estranged mother. Seok-woo could not say no.On the same train to Busan as Seok-woo and Su-an, a lady passenger with a bite wound on her legs, collapses and turns into a zombie. As she bites another person, that next person would also turn into a zombie and so on. Panic ensues on the train, and as everyone eventually discover along the way that the same zombie frenzy was true for the rest of the country. The fight to survive is now on.This film was one exhilarating roller-coaster ride from beginning to end. The zombies and their attack scenes were very well-executed with a combination of practical and computer-generated effects. These monsters were very fast-moving and relentless in their quest for human flesh. We hear people around us gasp and shriek with shock as we see these zombies pile up in droves and hordes, crash out of windows and barrel through doors. We breathlessly hang on to the edge of our seats the whole ride.Of course, what Korean film does not have a good dose of melodrama? The father-daughter dynamic between Seok-woo and Su-an is front and center. But aside from them, we also meet a cast of supporting characters on the train whose fates we will be following for the rest of the film. These include a burly man with his pregnant wife, a teenager with his girlfriend and his baseball team, a haughty businessman, two elderly sisters and a homeless man, among others. We get just enough introduction about who they are for us to care about what happens to them.Gong Woo played the flawed lead character Seok-woo very well. He was able to convincingly portray the development of this uncaring apathetic guy into a hero we could all root for to get through this crisis alive. He was as good in the weepy dramatic scenes as he was in the swashbuckling action scenes. This actor has come a long way since his breakout role as lead star of the TV romantic comedy series 'The Coffee Prince' back in 2007.Kim Su-an is only 10 years old but she had already been acting in films for five years now. She is the dramatic core of this film as the daughter desperately reaching out to her jaded father. As a child actress, she held her own impressively among this cast of veterans with her heartfelt portrayal. Who would have thought that the sad little song she wanted to sing for her father would resonate so much?Ma Dong-seok is charismatic as Sang-hwa, a devoted husband and selfless fighter. We see him first as some sort of comic relief only, which made the audience warm up to him. Later, we would discover how much more his character was able to do and give for others, and loved him more. His pregnant wife Seong-kyeong was played by acclaimed Korean indie film actress Jung Yu-mi, conveying strength in her delicate condition. Another actor of note is Kim Eui-sung, who was totally hateful in his role as the selfish Yong-suk. In total contrast to Sang-hwa, Yong- suk was a man only thought of himself alone, not caring that he actually put a lot of other characters directly into harm's way.Ahn So-hee (as Jin-hee) and Choi Woo-shik (as Young-guk) were in there to inject some teenage romantic angst into the film. They were relatively lightweight performers who were probably included just because they looked cool. That scene when Young-guk encounters his baseball teammates-turned-zombies was very well-conceived by the writers. People may dismiss as 'just' being a zombie film, but it is the drama of human relationships and interactions that rises above the horrific and thrilling carnage. Director Yeon Sang-ho's first two feature- length films ('The King of Pigs' and 'The Fake') were both animated films exploring the bleak side of human nature. With his first live action directorial effort, Yeon has created a complete film masterpiece with 'Train to Busan.' Highly recommended! 10/10.",10,250,448,5 September 2016
The Maze Runner," Another YA Dyspotian Novel-Film Too Many
","Again as is the present trend derived from 'Hunger Games', 'Divergent', 'The Giver' and many more, 'The Maze Runner' yet another young-adult post-apocalyptic science fiction novel of the same name by James Dashner, published in October 2007. It has two sequels in its trilogy: 'The Scorch Trials' and 'The Death Cure'. I haven't read the books yet, so I will just be judging the film as it is.The film starts with a boy who wakes up in a rapidly-rising elevator, which opened in a camp of teenage boys called the Glade. The boy eventually recalls that his name was Thomas, but nothing else from his past. being the main character, Thomas, of course, differed from the other boys. He was more curious about what lies beyond the Glade, and more determined to regain his freedom. The Glade was surrounded by a giant maze which the other boys had been trying to figure out for the three years that they have been there. However, the maze changes its configuration every night. Furthermore, there lives in the maze unseen deadly creatures called 'Grievers'. Why are these boys in the Glade? Will they ever get out of there? What does the arrival of a girl named Teresa in the Glade signify?The situation of the teenage boys trying to survive with each other in the Glade without any adult supervision is very much reminiscent of a much earlier young adult classic 'Lord of the Flies.' We also see here the usual ingredients in this genre: the enclosed arena, the stringent rules, the unknown outer limits, rebelling against establishment. This is one of those rare summer blockbuster films for which I did not know ANY of the actors by name. There may be familiar faces but they were not household names. The lead actor Dylan O'Brien does well in his role but it was really outstanding in any remarkable way. I was glad to see an Asian actor Ki Hong Lee in a major role as the original runner Minho. I just don't know if his book character was as non-proactive as it was portrayed on screen. I have to say though that the action sequences were done quite well. The running within the maze scenes were quite exciting and very entertaining to watch. For all the tension built up in the film though, the hanging ending could be quite a disappointment. Nothing really gets explained clearly. While this one will feel like an incomplete film, it makes the sequels must-sees for those who are interested enough to see the story through. However, honestly, after the excellence of the film version of 'The Hunger Games', with a big star Jennifer Lawrence in the lead, all of these similar genre films that followed its lead already pale in comparison. For me, 'The Maze Runner' just felt like another young adult dystopian film too many.",6,8,17,18 September 2014
Inglourious Basterds," Spaghetti Western Set in WW2 France
","As with any Quentin Tarantino film, it is either you like it or you don't. This guy really goes to extremes with his films, so audience reactions are also in extremes. When I first saw the trailer, with its references to '100 Nazi scalps,' I didn't think I would watch it. However, with all of these accolades coming in from various critics groups in the past weeks, I felt I had to watch this looming awards front-runner.The very first scene in the dairy farm of Perrier LaPadite (Denis was so tense. We get a first glimpse of the brilliant and much lauded performance of Christoph Waltz as SS Col. Hans Landa. His presence in subsequent scenes would then always strike a fearful chord. Waltz seems to be a lock for the Best Supporting Actor Oscar as early as now.The scene in the tavern with German actress Brigid von Hammersmark (Diane Kruger), Lt. Archie Hicox (Michael Fassbender) and SS Maj. Dieter Hellstrom (August Diehl) was another highlight of tension and mayhem.And of course that last slam-bang scene set in La Gamaar, the movie house of Shosanna Dreyfus (Melanie Laurent). I concede that it was too impossible (like, how could there be no security in the theater lobby???) but the indulgent wish-fulfillment is too irresistible to deny.Every scene Lt. Aldo Raine was in was darkly hilarious, even in the most gory ones. Brad Pitt plays the character tongue-in-cheek, seemingly always sticking out, out of place in the gravity of the wartime situation. But I was thoroughly entertained by this guy, as his presence lightens and loosens things up a bit, and that is good in a film like this.QT's love for movies is obvious here. As I wrote earlier, the climactic scene happens in a movie house. There are bits and pieces of movie discussions in various scenes involving Pvt. Fredrick Zoller (Daniel Bruhl) who was a German soldier who became a war hero, and later starred in a film about his military exploits made by no less than Joseph Goebbels. There are typical QT trademarks like gaudy character intros and rough annotations. Your guess is as good as mine why his title is spelled that way, another QT quirk and conceit, most probably.So, as with all QT films, watch 'Inglourious Basterds' at your own risk. Ignoring all the ultra-violence (what QT film doesn't have these scenes?), I think it is a pretty good film. But this is definitely not for all tastes, but it is one hell of a ride -- a shoot-em-up spaghetti western set in World War 2.",8,1,5,23 December 2009
Coraline," Mature Story and Disturbing Imagery: Not for Young Kids
","I have been curious to watch this animated film since I saw the trailer since late last year. I do not think it was ever shown locally in the theaters though. Anyway, I was finally able to watch it this Christmas Day.Coraline is a feisty pre-teen girl who is exasperated by her parents' apparent lack of concern and attention for her. She was thus easily enamored and tempted by the seemingly ideal 'Other mom' and 'Other dad' whom she met when she crawled into a small door in their house. That is, until she knew what this would cost her. Will Coraline be able to rescue herself and her family from the clutches of the evil witch? From the trailer, I kind of knew this was not really for kids. The shapes and the colors indicate a dark and sinister plot. And watching it just confirms this suspicion. What drew me to watch this was the amazing artwork and animation work. I did not know before I watched that the story was based on a work by Neil Gaiman, and the director was also the one who directed 'Tim Burton's A Nightmare Before Christmas.' So you can sort of get the drift of what I am saying. The story is mature and the imagery is disturbing. The technical aspects of this film are undeniably exceptional, and the main drawing point.The primary lesson I picked up is not necessarily targeted for kids though, but for busy parents. Parents should get their priorities straight first, and give their kids the time they need. I must admit I was uncomfortable watching these scenes of parental insouciance and neglect. I shudder at the thought that my kids would see these scenes and, God forbid, identify with poor Coraline. The lesson kids will get that they should love the parents they have may be a belated realization.",7,1,2,25 December 2009
This Is the End," A Totally Polarizing Film!
","'This is the End' is a fantasy pipe dream about what will happen if the end of the world happens in LA just when a party is happening at actor James Franco's house. This movie gathers James and his real-life gang of friends Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill, Jay Baruchel, Craig Robinson and the most raucous, brashest and biggest a**hole of them all, Danny McBride. There were several cameos from several stars, like Michael Cera, Rihanna, Paul Rudd, Emma Watson, and Channing Tatum in scenes you simply have to see to believe it. They all look like they had a lot of fun as the script (if there was one) took them for a grand ride from one movie genre to another. There is disaster, horror, action, sci-fi, and, heaven forbid, even religious! Of course, above all, there's the comedy. Comedy, of course, is in the eye of the beholder. This movie has some of the most insulting, crass, green, off-color, dirty, sacrilegious, drugged, misogynistic, offensive spoken and physical jokes of all time thrown at you mile a minute. If you are the sensitive type, you might even walk out of this rambunctious mayhem even before the half way point. However, if you are of the majority of their young fans, you will be laughing out loud all throughout its running time!I am finding it very hard to rate this movie. I admit I was laughing at a lot of the outrageously hilarious stupidity being shown on screen. However, I have to admit some of those jokes were really low blows. I just blame it all on Hollywood crudeness. This is a polarizing film you will either really enjoy or totally hate.",6,2,5,5 September 2013
Iron Man 2," Excellent Action Scenes With a Lot of Talky Scenes
","Iron Man 2 is not too easy to describe. When there are explosive action sequences, it was very very good. The first appearance of Whiplash at the Monaco race track, the confrontation of the two Iron Men at Stark's birthday, and of course the spectacular finale fight sequence at the Expo. However, the rest of the film was beset with a lot of talk! This actually surprised and disappointed me.Robert Downey Jr.' Tony Stark goes from a very haughty showoff to a depressed man wallowing in self-pity. No one plays cocky like Downey. No one plays drunk like Downey. While this may be a good acting vehicle for Downey, unfortunately, it also dragged down the middle portion of the movie quite a bit. I felt this part was quite prolonged for a cartoon-based action movie, and may be boring for young audiences. The time could have been used to develop the new characters some more.Mickey Rourke as Whiplash seemed to be an extension of his Oscar-nominated role in 'The Wrestler.' His character has an arresting presence, such that the simplistic way he was neutralized was a major letdown for me. Sam Rockwell was appropriately annoying as Hammer, the business arch-nemesis of Stark. Scarlett Johannsson was smart and sexy in her role as the Black Widow. Her scene infiltrating the Hammer compound was truly great kick-ass action.Overall, it was a very entertaining film, a good second installment in this franchise. The script can be very funny (anything with Pepper Potts), as it can also be quite serious (anything with Stark's dad). Enough hints are dropped about the coming Avengers sequel, including a funny scene with Captain America's shield. There was a scene at the end of the credits (which I failed to see because my kids wanted to go already). This was supposed to have involved Thor's hammer. The next film in this trilogy promises to be a bigger action blockbuster.",7,5,13,30 April 2010
World War Z," Nothing to Do With the Book, Except for the Zombies
","The trailer for this film was very exciting. It did not show anything really about what the film was about, except for some big unknown event that was turning the city into sudden chaos one morning.I found out that there was a book that inspired this film, so I sought it out to read it. I was surprised to discover that this book, and I guess likewise the film, is about ZOMBIES! The trailers (wisely, I thought) did NOT show zombies at all. The book by Max Brooks was a compilation of short man vs. zombie stories which were happening all over the world. More than 50% into the book, I did not read any scene that remotely resembled the scenes shown in the trailer. I was ready at that point to concede that this Brad Pitt film will have nothing to do with the book except for the main fighting a worldwide zombie infestation premise. And I turned out to be right.'World War Z', the film, is about Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt), a UN special operations agent, who had retired from that job to be with his family. (This character Gerry Lane was NOT even in the book.) We follow Gerry's adventures as it starts in his home town of Philadelphia, PA, as we saw in the trailer, when he gets his family to safety, and was then assigned to play a vital role in the zombie fight. The rest of the film brings Gerry to Korea, Israel, and Wales as he was able to observe and hypothesize a possible weakness in these zombies. The latter third of the film happens in a WHO facility where he was able to actually conduct the experiment he needed to prove his theory. Can Gerry discover the key to turn the tide of the war to the human's favor or will the zombies continue to spread their plague?The zombie scenes were NOT unnecessarily gory. There were NO scenes of exploding heads or trailing guts or gushing body fluids which are commonly seen in other zombie movies, even as these were very graphically described in the book. While horror purists would call this lame, the way it was done in this film was not any less exciting, yet makes this movie more accessible to more people. This could have been a spectacular gore fest, but obviously the filmmakers had a different vision in mind.The scenes of the mass zombie attacks were very well-executed by the computer-generated visual effects. The Jerusalem scenes were especially disturbing and heart-racing. The scenes on the Belarus Airlines jet plane were also exciting as they were unbelievable. They try their best to give credible scientific approach to the problem, and I would give them props for that. This is even if the plan was on the simplistic side, and shaky in the medical sense. Opportunistic infections, anyone? However, they did prepare us for that solution by the statement a character makes at the beginning of the mission.Brad Pitt did well as the lead actor. He was practically the only known name in the cast, and he dominates the screen with this star presence. Yet, we can still empathize with his character Gerry and the difficult situations he got into, no matter how incredibly lucky or superhuman he may have become. He had a 'sort-of' commercial for a particular soft- drink brand towards the end, which was amusing, yet still well- integrated in the action of the scene.Even if the film had almost nothing to do with the book, I found this movie quite absorbing and intense, and ultimately entertaining and satisfying. Maybe they should have just changed the title.",7,12,31,20 June 2013
The Hunger Games," Practically How I Envisioned the Book (Except Probably Cinna and the Cornucopia)
","Just came home from watching 'The Hunger Games.' I have read all three books by Suzanne Collins several months before, so I know what will happen already. Despite this knowledge, I remained excited and riveted by how the details of the story had been translated on screen by writer- director Gary Ross.The first hour was dedicated to the events preceding the games, as the last hour and a half depicted the games themselves. This movie was the story of a future world, in a country with 12 districts controlled a central Capitol. Every year, they would commemorate the revolution by staging a 'Hunger Games', where two tributes from each district would fight to the death until only one remains the victor. On this the 74th Games, the tributes of outlying District 12 would be Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutchinson) and the central heroine of the series, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence).I could say really that this movie was practically how I imagined the book while I was reading it. I guess you can also say that Suzanne Collins' description of this non-existent world was so vividly cinematic to begin with. First rate special effects were used to bring essential highlights of the book, such as the 'girl on fire' costume and the control room of game-master, Seneca Crane (Wes Bentley). However, credit should also be given the intimate scenes that did not rely on any special effect, but the sensitivity of the actors themselves. These were also well-executed, albeit sometimes bordering on cheesy (although that was how they really were described in the book!). Overall, I would say this movie achieved that rare balance between book and film interpretation. Fans of the book and those who never read the books both would appreciate the characters, story-telling, the set design, art direction and visual effects. This is a must-see, and sets up the upcoming sequels as there is no doubt they will also produce the next two books, 'Catching Fire' and 'Mockingjay'. Well-recommended!",8,9,28,21 March 2012
The Impossible," Young Tom Holland Carries This Film!
","'The Impossible' was about the disastrous 2004 tsunami in Thailand. It was heart-pounding to see the devastating wave rise up so unexpectedly and heart-wrenching to see it completely destroy an entire unsuspecting town. The director did not spare us from the gory things that happen under the rampaging waters, where the humans (particularly, Naomi Watts) get seriously wounded with the various debris that hit them underwater.We follow a family of five who miraculously survives the disaster. At first we only see the mom Maria (Naomi Watts), then her eldest son Lucas (Tom Holland). As Maria was taken to the hospital to treat her serious leg injury and Lucas looks after her, we see that her husband Henry and two younger sons also survive with minor injuries. Following a suspenseful series of near misses in the hospital, the family, and the audience, were rewarded with a gloriously touching, inevitably tear-jerking reunion scene.I do not really understand why Naomi Watts is getting the lions' share of the awards buzz, even getting an Oscar nomination for Best Actress. In fact, young Tom Holland deserves it more with numerous difficult scenes he had to do when Naomi was already rendered bedridden by her severe injuries. Ewan McGregor was no slouch as well, but he had limited screen time compared to Naomi and Tom.I thought that this film was too long, despite the fact that the tidal wave already struck within the first 10 minutes of the running time. We do not really know the central family that well. There were several scenes that seemed repetitive and just added on to prolong the basic story, or to heighten drama, like Naomi's slow-motion surfacing from the water scene. Apart from a few winning scenes, as a whole the film is, unfortunately, also water-logged.",6,1,6,10 January 2013
Argo," It's Supposed to Be Real Events, But Still Unbelievable!
","When I saw the trailer of 'Argo,' I already felt like the whole story was already shown. I did not feel like I wanted to watch it. The story of rescuing hostages in Iran by pretending they were shooting a movie is simply unbelievable. The star and director was one of my least favorite Hollywood actors, Ben Affleck. However, curiosity still got the better of me when nothing but stellar reviews came out when it was shown. There was even talk of Oscar nominations! This I had to see.Ben Affleck plays Tony Mendez who came up with this wild idea. He plays it smartly low key in the whole movie. But in that key scene where he announces his idea in the first place, I still feel that Ben was deficient as the lead actor. I would not have been sold the way he delivered the critical line about his suggestion to film a fake movie. It is great though that the rest of the supporting cast succeeded very well in their respective roles. Alan Arkin and John Goodman were very funny as the Hollywood people who help Ben hatch the fake absurd sci-fi project which they dubbed 'Argo.'The story is still as unbelievable as I thought. The whole scheme felt so shallow and lame, something only a B-movie producer would greenlight. We are talking about rescuing Americans trapped in Iran in the 70s under the Ayatollah Khoemeini here, and all they can come with was something as ridiculous and far-fetched as this one. But I guess what they say is true, that truth is stranger than fiction. Fortunately, Ben Affleck the director was able to sell the whole movie to us in a very tight, tense and assured way. The climactic sequence of the escape proper was done in a rather clichéd Hollywood-y manner, but you can't help but hang on to the edge of your seats. The film editing, the very late 70s style cinematography, the realistic set and costume design all contribute to the success of story telling.This is a very good suspense thriller yes, but to call it the next Oscar Best Picture I think is over reaching a bit. Like 'The Town' before this, Ben Affleck has improved as a director, but the Oscar for Best Director for 'Argo' may also be too much of an ambition. Nominations for both categories though are real possibilities, but are more certain in the Supporting Actor and the technical categories.",7,2,4,16 November 2012
Star Trek Into Darkness," Excellent Action, Excellent Sci-Fi, Excellent Human Drama!
","I am very happy to report that 'Star Trek Into Darkness' more than lives up to the previous movie, the franchise reboot 'Star Trek' (2009). In this their second film, the new cast portraying the crew of the Starship Enterprise all really got well and cozy into the skins of their iconic characters. Director JJ Abrams has come up with a movie that will satisfy both old and new fans of this revered franchise. The action and sci-fi sequences are excellent with awesome CGI whatever the setting of the scene, be it in outer space or on land in any planet. The initial sequence alone set in the background of an impending volcanic eruption on a planet with red trees was already breathtaking. And this high level of visual and visceral excellence and excitement would be repeated and maintained throughout the film. The human dimension of the story is also truly executed with excellence. The key scenes between Kirk and Spock were essayed so well by Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto. I enjoyed the interaction and the cooperation among the crew, each with their own talents. Simon Pegg (as Scotty) and Karl Urban (as Dr. Bones) particularly stand out. The antagonist is a super- soldier first known as Harrison, who turns out to be another big character in the Star Trek canon (a name who is in the title of what was arguably the best of the original Star Trek movies). Upcoming actor Benjamin Cumberbatch portrays this super-villain with amazing screen presence. This is a very entertaining, very satisfying movie I heartily recommend to everyone, Star Trek nerd or not. It covers all aspects of the Star Trek that makes it a lasting popular favorite: the team, the adventure, the action, the drama, and yes, the humor, all are still definitely there. The reverence to classic 'Star Trek' is intact, with cameo appearances by Klingons, Leonard Nimoy and even a Tribble. Yet, there is no stuffy feeling anywhere here, everything is fresh and jumping.I was very surprised that this film did not receive the huge hype that 'Iron Man 3' did. This excellent film deserves and should make more than just good box office. Anyway, I am glad that it would be steady positive word of mouth that would bring this film its immense success, and not overblown undeserved hype. Highly highly recommended, 10/10!",10,9,35,16 May 2013
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," The Plot and the Characters are Unbelievable
","There had been a lot of good words about this comedy called 'Crazy Stupid Love.' Although I am not really a guy who would go and watch a romantic comedy, I watched this one for Steve Carrell, whom I believe is one of the funniest guys in Hollywood now. This movie starts with Emily (Julianne Moore) telling her husband of 25 years Cal (Steve Carrell) that she wants a divorce while they were dining in a restaurant. OK, so now I know that I have a black comedy ahead of me. The movie follows Cal who was 'helped' by playboy Jacob (Ryan Gosling) to get him ready to meet other women. One of the women he hooks up with is Kate (the hilarious Marisa Tomei). Emily on the other hand, takes up with David (the ever smarmy Kevin Bacon). Side stories include Jacob hooking up with young lawyer Hannah (Emma Stone), who in turn was hoping her colleague (Josh Groban) would propose to her. Meanwhile, Cal and Emily's 13-year old son Robbie is sure that his 17-year old babysitter Jessica (America's Next Top Model finalist Analeigh Tipton) is his soul mate. But she is in love with a much older married man. Such is the complicated web that this movie weaves.Steve Carrell again does very well with this sad-sack character that he seems to know so well. His deadpan delivery in some pretty funny situations that Cal gets himself into was spot on. The character of Ryan Gosling though, I find preposterous. I agree with Cal's belated realization that this guy is one big creep. The women basically play straight men to the male characters, with Marisa Tomei shining in the laughs department despite her short role.While I liked the surprises in the climax and the touching scene at Robbie's graduation, the rest of the film did not really appeal to me too much. Yes, there were funny parts but a lot fall flat for me. I must say that for conservatives, there can be a lot of uncomfortable situations that may be hard to watch in this film. I know women may disagree with me about Ryan Gosling's part though.",5,24,36,11 August 2011
Public Enemies," Nothing Much Apart from its Stars
","I was disappointed with 'Public Enemies.' A lot of expectations were developed for this film because of the star combination that it features -- Johnny Depp, Christian Bale and Marion Cotillard. It also has an interesting central character, John Dillinger. I have read about the gangster Dillinger in various books in the past, but don't really know much about him, so I was curious to find out more about him.Unfortunately, I did not really like this movie. The direction seemed to be rambling. The running time was too long. The scenes were confusing. I could not recognize the other characters during those many heists and gun fights. There was no excitement that develops despite the subject matter. I found several parts of the movie actually sleep-inducing. There was no build-up on the character of Dillinger at all, which I found the most disappointing. We meet him at the height of his career, but we do not know how he really got there.Johnny Depp does not really disappear into his role as Dillinger. I can clearly recognize his acting tics, like how he wears his shades. I do not think Dillinger ever wore shades that way. Despite that, he is still the best part of this movie. He is charismatic and likable, like how Dillinger supposedly was. His scenes with Marion Cotillard (as his moll Billie Frechette) were the most involving parts of the whole film.On the other hand, Christian Bale is simply turning out to be one boring actor for me. His scenes are very uninteresting. His acting is dull. His line delivery is quite monotone. The way he was eating his words was reminiscent of his Batman character, if you can imagine that. During his scene with Johnny Depp, Bale could not hold a candle to the incandescence of Depp's star appeal.Overall, this was a waste of time for me. I expected too much, and got short-changed in a major way. Director Michael Mann was not able to deliver the best product out of the promising subject matter it had. I think another better film about John Dillinger can still be made in the future, as this one is not a definitive biography.",4,2,3,25 July 2009
The Babadook," Unexpected Horror Gem
","At first I was not thinking of watching 'The Babadook.' The title sounded corny. There were no known actors. The trailer was dull and unpromising. Everything about it screamed bad B-movie. Surprisingly though, when initial reviews were coming out, they were all very positive. In fact, there were even respected critics who rated it a 5/5, very rare in the horror genre. With these excellent endorsements, I was compelled to go watch it in order to see what the fuss is all about.Amelia is a young widow with a seven year-old son, Samuel. Her husband Oskar died violently while he was taking her to the hospital to give birth. The sweet and kind Amelia, who works as a caretaker in a nursing home, is not really moving on well from her traumatic experience, and her special child Samuel's excessive hyperactivity and monster phobia is aggravating her woes.One day, Samuel picks out a new book off his shelf called 'Mr. Babbadook'. As Amelia began to read this hard-bound pop-up book, she realizes that this had disturbing images and even more disturbing words. From that moment on, 'Mr. Babadook' with his top hat, overcoat, shadowy form and long sharp fingers, would insidiously insinuate itself into the lives of mother and child, until all hell literally breaks loose in their household.Writer/director Jennifer Kent was lucky that the two actors who played mother and child, Essie Davis as Amelia and Noah Wiseman as Samuel, captured her vision perfectly. Davis was subtle and convincing in her dramatic transformation from mild-mannered nurse to a raving virago. Despite his gentle age, Wiseman was able to portray Samuel's difficult behavioral condition and his efforts to protect his mother at all costs. I totally see what the critics loved about this film, It was a throwback to simpler times when there were limited special effects and effective scares were dependent on the skill of the director to create these creepy moments. Whoever designed the Babadook pop-up book deserves praise because it really looked so unnerving, especially in its second incarnation. More than just the technical matters of film-making though, the director succeeds in setting up and elaborating the problematic relationship between mother and child and that was essential to make the whole film work.During the parts when the Babadook was already exerting his negative influence on the family, the tension developed was very thick and the suspense can be unbearably uncomfortable. It was not really about scaring the audience scream silly, This film will make you reflect about the true nature of the sinister Babadook and what it represents. While it does not totally shake off its B-movie feel, especially with the awkwardly puzzling ending with the bowl of worms, but this humble Australian film definitely achieves its objectives as horror-drama with sterling results. 7/10.",7,7,16,23 September 2014
The Other Boleyn Girl," Period Piece on a Dysfunctional Family
","I like historical fiction in general. I like films that deal with historical events. So I really made time out of this very busy week to see this film. The star power of course helped a lot to convince me to catch this. Imagine a movie that combines Natalie Portman AND Scarlett Johannsen. It is certainly a must-see for that combination alone.These two stars played the Boleyn sisters at the time of Henry VIII. Natalie is the more familiar Boleyn girl Anne, while Scarlett plays the unknown sister Mary. While their ambitious family is trying to push Anne to interest the King (played by the lucky Eric Bana), he actually falls for younger and married Mary first. Because of this, the family is brought to live in the King's court. Mary gets pregnant and gives birth to a son. But by then, the King has turned his eyes to Anne.The rest of the story, we are more familiar with already -- how Anne teases the King with her wiles so much that he breaks with the Catholic Church in order to divorce his wife Catherine of Aragon. However, when the King finally gains Anne's body (in an unexpectedly violent manner in this film), he is at the same time racked with severe guilt feelings about what he had done.This situation was not helped when Anne first born was a daughter. When Anne suffered a miscarriage next, she was already on the brink of madness on how to hang on to her position in court, especially since the king has already begun to show interest in Jane Seymour.We all know what happens to Anne in the end, so there is really no suspense there. But the family dynamics in the Boleyn family is really very interesting, albeit disturbing, to watch. The side stories and fates of Mary and brother George, as with those of their parents (particularly the mother so well-played by Kristin Scott Thomas) are so well integrated in the known history. I am not really sure where fiction separates from facts in these auxiliary stories.It was melodramatic, that is for sure. There were so many key omissions, such as the role of Thomas More, who was not even mentioned. Nevertheless, I was entertained. Got me interested to reading the book by Philippa Gregory soon. Good enough just to see Natalie and Scarlett together, most definitely.",6,0,3,21 April 2008
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Very Entertaining Summer Blockbuster Film!
","I was looking forward to this film because of the hype, and I was afraid to be disappointed. But as the film unfolded, I most definitely enjoyed this adventure from beginning to end.Jake Gyllenhaal plays the titular Prince of Persia, Dastan, who was an urchin picked by the King from the marketplace to be his third son. He and his brothers get caught in a web of political high jinx that cross their paths with Princess Tamina of Alamut (played by Gemma Arterton), and the fabled powers of the Sands of Time.This is Jake Gyllenhaal's most accessible film so far, and he goes to town with it. OK, granted he does not look the least bit Persian, or of that particular time period, but somehow his charisma was able to carry us on this fantastic ride. I also enjoyed his interaction with the beautiful Arterton, which sparks with humor and romance. She was my favorite part of 'Clash of the Titans (2010),' and same here.I highly recommend this film for a good old-fashioned, action-adventure film set in ancient times. The parkour sequences are definitely of the highest order and very well-edited and photographed. The sets and visual effects are excellent. Best of all, the story is intelligent and well-constructed. Producer Jerry Bruckheimer has again delivered a very entertaining summer blockbuster. A very well-executed film of its genre. A must watch!",8,114,163,30 May 2010
The Secret in Their Eyes," Multi-Layered Oscar Winner
","I never would have even heard of this movie, if not for its unexpected Oscar win in the category of Best Foreign Language Film.This is a Foreign Language film which could have been set anywhere in the world. There was nothing really uniquely Argentinean about its characters and situation. A retired investigator wants to write a novel about a 25-year old unresolved brutal rape-murder case that affected him the most. He reconnects with the people associated with the case to get insights about his writings. In the process, he discovers more about this cold case, as well as about his own self and his relationships.The film works as a crime mystery-thriller. It also works as a romance drama. There are also scenes of fine comedy. These multiple layers were well-combined and well-executed into one fine film. The camera work is very good with its focus on the eyes of the characters, as the title would suggest. There were also very exciting action shots during the soccer stadium scenes.Unfortunately, there were some flaws in the plot development, with incredible jumps of deduction and coincidences which may strain credulity and logic. Something totally trivial and incidental turned out to be the most revelatory clue, more than once in the story. The ending is something which may impress some, and disappoint others. I personally liked the eerie way it was done despite the melodramatic manner.Overall, there is nothing so spectacular about this film that makes it truly outstanding. Of the nominated Foreign Language films this year, I definitely liked 'The Secret of Their Eyes' more than 'The White Ribbon' and 'A Prophet.' However, when you compare this to the nominees of last year's Oscar for Foreign Language Film, I liked 'Departures,' 'The Class,' 'Waltz With Bashir' and 'Revenge' more than this one.",6,3,39,16 March 2010
127 Hours," James Franco's One Man Show
","In '127 Hours', James Franco plays Aron Ralston, an alpha male rock- climber who got trapped in a crevice in Utah Canyonwoods Park back in April 2003 when a big rock pinned his right hand. I was curious at how director Danny Boyle was able to expound on this limited premise and get awards buzz, so I watched despite my initial lack of interest. The trapping incident occurs only 15 minutes into the film. From there and the next hour, we get to see Aron talking to himself and to his camera, philosophizing, hallucinating about past and future, as he struggles to survive and extricate himself from this trap. All this, up to the harrowing last 20 minutes when he does escape, all graphically and painfully captured on screen.The spectacular achievement in this film is the beautiful cinematography. The camera work, the composition, lighting and the angles were fantastic. The scenery of the vast canyons, the rolling clouds, the flash flood, the creeping sunbeam, even the water bottle, -- all awesome photography. James Franco has certainly progressed from his Harry Osborne days. He carries this movie all by himself, as there are practically no other supporting characters. This is his one-man show. That scene capturing the moment when Aron first realizes that he is trapped was so naturally done -- a great acting moment for Franco.As I said, initially I did not like to watch this. In all the press releases, we know he will cut off his arm in order to save himself, so there was even no surprise on how the movie will end. You can imagining how singular this incident is, in such an enclosed space, with a particularly gruesome climax. This movie is clearly not for everybody. It shows a man's struggle to survive at all costs. You know the message is positive, but are you willing to watch it? Now, that is another question.",6,10,16,13 January 2011
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," A Series of Great Imaginative Action Scenes!
","I do not really read the original comics, so I went into this as a fan of the X-Men movies and TV cartoon series. So I am not really sure if this movie was faithful to the story. But having said that, based on its own merits, I think this movie is really awesome. Despite being leaked on the net, this is the sort of film that deserves to be seen on the big screen.I think they were correct in choosing Wolverine as the subject of the first movie about the origins of the X-Men. The character has that combination of coolness and mystery that makes for an interesting back story. Where did all his pent-up anger come from?The movie starts way way back in 1840's when Jimmy (Logan) and his brother Victor (Creed) were still children.These two special invincible children grow up and go through different wars in a great opening sequence montage. Because of their fighting skills and invincibility, the two brothers (now played by Hugh Jackman and Liev Schrieber respectively) were recruited by Stryker to join a special military force.Logan realized that that life is not right for him so he decided to desert the group. He went on to hook up with a pretty school teacher Kayla (Lynn Collins) as his girlfriend to lead an idyllic life as a lumberjack in Canada, or so he thought. One day, his brother Victor comes back and kills the girlfriend. From there, the whole story of Logan's revenge and retribution, and the actual origin of the Adamantium skeleton of Wolverine will further unfold.Of course, a movie like this will have to feature special effects. And certainly, the effects here surpass those of the previous X-Men movies. There was that very exciting fight of Logan and Agent Zero (Daniel Henney) involving a motorcycle versus a helicopter. Amazing action choreography there. And the same is true in the scene of Logan, Victor and Weapon XI on one of the towers of Three Mile Island was fantastically rendered. This was because Weapon XI was a swordsman mutant who had been artificially imbued with other mutant powers like those of John Wraith and Cyclops, making for an breathtaking fight. The sound effects and the film editing were fantastic in these scenes and more.I think all fans of the X-Men movies will like this excellent prequel of sorts to the entire X-Men saga. Gambit finally made an appearance in an X-Men movie, played by Taylor Kitsch. There were already scenes which showed how the young mutants of the earth have gathered together, along with a cameo by a certain bald headed mentor. There was also very nice dramatic touches with the relationship of the two brothers, and the relationship of Logan and his girlfriend Kayla. Script is simple to follow despite the number of stories intertwined. Overall, a very good, thrilling and thoroughly satisfying movie.**** By the way, there is a scene about Col. Stryker in the middle of the first part of the credits, then another one about Logan at the very end of the credits. You may want to wait up for them, but don't expect too much though.",8,8,19,30 April 2009
About Time," As Much About Family As It Was About Romance
","On New Year's Day of his 21st year, Tim Lake (Domhall Gleeson) learns from his Dad (Bill Nighy) that the men in their family can travel back in time to specific moments in their lives. There will be rules that cannot be violated lest past events altered will give rise to completely different outcomes. Naturally kind-hearted Tim uses this power to get himself a girlfriend, among other good-intentioned deeds in conscious 'Groundhog Day' scenarios. Domhnall Gleeson (whom we will recognize as one of the elder Weasley brothers in the Harry Potter series) felt really sincere as dorky Tim, and his relationship with insecure Mary, sweetly played by Rachel McAdams (already the heroine of love stories like 'The Notebook' and 'The Time Traveller's Wife'), was very disarming indeed. They were an ideal couple here. The scenes on how he successfully got Mary to be his girlfriend and their very different wedding and the reception were their best scenes together. OK, Gleeson may look a bit younger than McAdams, but you still can't deny that their positive chemistry was truly palpable.However despite this being marketed as a romantic love story, I felt more emotionally-connected with the scenes played between Tim and his quirky family, especially Tim and his Dad. There may have been scenes which violate the very rules upon which their time-traveling is based, but the sentiment was so poignant I decided to just overlook them.The cinematography of the Cornwall coastal panorama and the streets of London were very charming. The perfectly-timed entrance of selected pop oldies and ethereal new songs adds to the emotional atmosphere created by the situations.Some scenes that I felt went a little too long, contributing to a running time of more than two hours. The whole side plot about beautiful Charlotte (Margot Robbie) could have been shortened, as well as that endless scene where Mary was choosing a dress to wear to an event. Overall though, this is a very pleasant British love story by Richard Curtis, who wrote and directed classics like 'Four Weddings and a Funeral,' 'Notting Hill' and 'Love Actually.' Again like his other films, 'About Time' is also about love and family, but this one had an actual fantasy element in play, and that unique magical touch adds to the fun and the romance of the story.",7,4,8,10 September 2013
Juno," Juno's Parents are the Best Part of the Movie
","This is the fifth and last Best Picture nominee that I have seen. Just in the nick of time for the Oscar ceremony on Monday morning, which I won't be able to watch! Isn't that ironic? Anyway, of all the nominees, 'Juno' is the most accessible to the casual movie fan. It is understandable why this is the only one of the five nominees to be a box office hit, grossing more than $100M.The situations and the dialogues are so much closer to reality than the others. The plot is simple and direct, but the treatment is unique. It was interesting to note that the writer (Oscar nominated and likely winner of Best Original Screenplay) Diablo Cody used to be a stripper. I guess that would account for the avant garde yet frank treatment of the sensitive subject matter of teenage sex and pregnancy. The script has a decidedly feminine bent, showing the strengths of the women characters.The musical score was very unusual. I cannot even define the genre of that music and those quirky jangly songs! Very interesting soundtrack.The actors are really very good here, led of course by Ellen Page playing Juno. She is very believable in her portrayal of a strong sensible, smart-alecky high school girl whose unexpected pregnancy expectedly shakes up her life. I can't believe she is actually already 20 years old! Jennifer Garner is very remarkable as well playing the childless woman who wanted to adopt Juno's baby. She has very touching moments, and she was really effective in them. Especially that scene where she was talking to Juno's bulging tummy in the mall. There was also those tense scenes that dealt with complicated marital issues she had with her husband Mark (Jason Bateman).My favorite couple in this movie are J.K. Simmons and Allison Janney as Juno's dad and stepmom. If this movie was set in the Philippines, all hell would have broken loose in that scene where Juno confesses her pregnancy to her parents. There was none of that here, in a rather sharp contrast of cultures. They had very witty and snappy lines. Great scene of Allison giving the holier-than-thou ultrasound technician a piece of her mind.Overall, it was admittedly better than I expected. However, I do not really think this is really Best Picture material. It won't go home empty-handed I would bet. I do think its main chance for an Oscar is for its Original Screenplay. That said, the morality issue will always be with this movie. What message exactly does it say and deliver to teens of today about teen pregnancy?",6,3,9,23 February 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Saved by the last 2/3!!!
","The first hour, for me, went by so slowly and unexcitingly. The scenes of multiple Johnny Depps were too stagy, hammy and self-indulgent, not to mention too weird. (Sorry, Jess and Helene!) I thought that Chow Yun Fat was under-used (even 'mis'used) in his role. However, once that Council Meeting of the Pirates got underway, I got the Pirates movie I was waiting very eagerly for!The last 2/3's contained the swashbuckling action, drama, comedy and romance of the high level we have come to expect from this franchise. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley look good together and do very well in their action scenes, as well as their 'wedding' scene. There was no scene here that was as distinctive as the 'Fighting on the Rolling Wheel' scene in Pirates 2, but there were several well-choreographed fight scenes here as well.I was not too happy with the Calypso scenes, nor how that was resolved. They way it was built up, I was expecting a bigger revenge disaster, than the rain and whirlpool we got.",7,3,6,11 June 2007
Spider-Man 3," Overall, not bad... Yet, not very satisfying!
","Got to squeeze some time yesterday to catch Spiderman 3. Well, what is my verdict? Let me put it this way. Don't expect too much. All the hype and excitement might make you expect something you might not get. Among the 3 Spiderman movies, I personally still liked Spiderman 2 the best. This third installment tries too much to squeeze so many characters and plot lines into an almost 3 hour movie. Either the Sandman story alone or the Alien Symbiote/Venom story alone should have been chosen to intermix with the love story sequences. Having all of them together felt too much, yet you also feel short-shrifted on how these stories were resolved. The action sequences are exciting, for sure. The Sandman sequences are breathtaking CG. The 'hip bad-boy' Peter Parker sequences were funny, yet also very prolonged and repetitive. Overall, not bad, yet not very satisfying.****Spoiler Alert**** I don't read the spider-man comics. So some details are unclear to me.What really is the role of Gwen Stacy in the life of Peter and MJ? Her name comes up with fondness when comics fanboys write about Spidey, but her storyline was so wasted in this overloaded film.Is is really possible that Harry makes a turnaround so the New Green Goblin was able to help Spiderman in that final battle? Why didn't the butler reveal to Harry what he knew earlier? It was so vital.Was Flynt Marko really responsible for Uncle Ben's death??? Or was this only for the movie?",6,1,2,5 May 2007
Midnight in Paris," A Classic Nostalgic Woody Allen Charmer
","When I first heard the lead character of 'Midnight in Paris' talk, I thought it was Woody Allen talking. But when I looked at the screen, I saw Owen Wilson! I do not know if Owen was purposely doing it, but he was channeling Woody Allen perfectly in intonation and diction. Maybe it was the characteristic style Woody Allen wrote his script, I don't know but it was so uncanny and this added to my enjoyment of this film.'Midnight in Paris' is about a movie scriptwriter and struggling novelist Gil (Owen Wilson) who was trapped in a stifling relationship with his snooty fiancée Inez (Rachel Mc Adams). This becomes more evident during their supposedly romantic vacation in Paris, when Inez spending more time with her snobbish parents and her 'pseudo- intellectual pedantic' male friend Paul (Michael Sheen). To escape, Gil takes a midnight walk in the side streets of Paris, and was magically transported to the 1920s where he encounters his literary heroes like Ernest Hemingway (Corey Stoll), and Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates). He also meets and falls in love with Pablo Picasso's muse Adriana (Marion Cotillard). How Gil faces and resolves this unusual situation is the unique premise of this delightful little Woody Allen masterpiece.'Midnight in Paris' is a very charming movie. It is about yearning for something much better than what you have now. It had me from the get- go, very interesting right away. The initial five minutes of beautiful Parisian scenes and music will put you in the proper mood right away and never let you go. People who loves literature and the arts will certainly share Gil's excitement and fascination about actually meeting these authors in the flesh. Cameos by Dali (a funny turn by Adrien Brody), Fitzgerald, Bunuel, Matisse, and even Toulouse-Lautrec, Degas and Gauguin further add to the nostalgia. I have some quibbles only about Gil finding Adriana's book, but that is minor. Only Woody Allen can make an off-the-wall movie like this and get away with it! A definite must-watch!",8,1,3,4 January 2012
Zodiac," Darkly comic tale of obsession
","I saw Zodiac today. I was deciding between Bordertown and this one, but decided on Zodiac because of the director David Fincher, whose Seven is a classic. I was not disappointed. The atmosphere is really creepy. Just like what jess said, the murders were just the backdrop of the story. The main plot and 2/3's of the film revolves around the men investigating this case, whose lives were drawn into a tangled net by their obsession about solving the case.Jake Gyllenhaal was very good in his role, as a dorkish naive cartoonist, whose family life was rent apart by his obsession with Zodiac. My favorite sequence was when Jake's character visited the cinema owner's eerie house and basement. It was darkly comic, yet without losing its creepy edge and chilling atmosphere. Jake was so effective in that scene!Marc Ruffalo had to deal with a very difficult voice quality and accent, but he was believable. Chloe Sevigny was also quietly effective in her unexpectedly limited role, same with Dermot Mulroney (even dared to show his paunch!).Much praise had been heaped on the performance of Robert Downey, Jr. But honestly, I don't get the love. I felt he actually ruined my appreciation any scene which contained him in with his ambiguous alcoholic character, which he played in a very annoying and hammy manner. Sorry for the Downey fans out there.The ending was a bit abrupt and disjointed. But overall, this movie is definitely worth its screening time.",7,1,2,12 June 2007
Milk," Sorry, I Simply Did Not Care About It
","This is the 4th Best Picture nominee I have seen. Honestly, I do not think I would even watch it if it were not nominated. I do not really like Sean Penn. Even his Oscar-winning role in 'Mystic River' did not really work for me as I found it to be overacting.Sean Penn already won the SAG Best Actor award for this performance and he is the front runner in the Oscar race. I do not know the real Harvey Milk, so this is just Sean Penn acting gay for me. He was good in giving powerful political speeches, but nothing really spectacular. I do not get the love, sorry. The nominated role of Josh Brolin as Milk's political nemesis Dan White lacks something in the way the role was written and executed. His motivations are not clearly rationalized. And his acting was quite leaden, especially in the 'drunk' scene.As for the ensemble acting, OK, I would agree that they were good in portraying homosexuals. However, Diego Luna is too over the top as the unstable Latino toyboy. Emile Hirsch's character Cleve came out of nowhere, I do not know why he was there. High School Musical's Lucas Grabeel surprisingly appears here in a very un-Disney role, but very minor though.However, the revelation here is James Franco. He is actually very good as the loyal boyfriend Scott. He showed a different dimension in his acting range. He should have been nominated for Supporting Actor instead of Brolin, in my opinion.'Milk' has a good documentary feel to it, and that is thanks to the directorial talent of Guy Van Sant. I like the mix of historical clips and the recreated scenes. I guess it is just that the subject matter that I do not really care for, so the whole movie did not matter to me.",4,12,28,3 February 2009
The Prestige," Don't Expect Too Much or it may be Disappointing
","This is one of those movies where the story is the main attraction. It is a very sad and disturbing movie about intense and violent rivalry, this time in the field of magic, at the turn of the century.The set and art direction, as well as the costumes are also very good. Interesting thing also to inject a real character, Nikola Tesla (played by David Bowie!), in there. Did not know that Tesla had a bad conflict with Thomas Edison and it was that severe! (Should read up on that....)I felt that the acting styles of the two leads were one of the disappointing points of the movie. Hugh Jackman tends to be too over the top, as if he were in a stage production. Christian Bale is severely underplaying his part, his face seemed to be in a perpetual scowl. Of course, the fact that they were playing two dislikable characters probably contributed to this.The direction of the movie by Christopher Nolan is typical of him. Jumping back and forth in time, it was OK but I felt it made the movie a bit hard to follow at the beginning. But once you get the drift, it was very interesting.****Spolier Alert****Maybe it was just me, but one major thing that confused me was Julia, the wife of Angier (Hugh Jackman). She looked like Scarlett Johanssen. Then later after the wife dies in a tragic stage accident, Angier's assistant, Olivia, was again Scarlett Johanssen. Admittedly, I had to stop the DVD right at that point and run to the computer to check IMDb because it was affecting my appreciation of the movie. Turns out that the wife Julia was played by a different actress, Piper Perabo. Olivia is really Scarlett. OK then, these two girls were just fixed up in too much the same way. Once that was settled, I was able to follow the flow of the story much better.The ending is another problem for me. After all the revenge and the deaths, I felt the happy ending for one of them was completely undeserved.",5,3,6,11 March 2007
Ready Player One," Virtual Virtuosity
","'Ready Player One' was first a sci-fi novel written by Ernest Cline, published in 2011. Warner Bros. saw so much potential in this novel, they bought the rights for its film version a full year before it was even published. Cline adapted his own book into a script, with the assistance of veteran screenwriter Zak Penn. With Steven Spielberg signing on to direct in 2015, this film had all the ingredients for a blockbuster film.It is 2045. Wade Watt was an orphaned young man who lived in the 'Stacks,' a dystopian slum neighborhood in Columbus, Ohio. Like everyone else at that time, Wade spent his days going inside the OASIS, a virtual world where people can do anything they desire. As his avatar Parzival, Wade wanted to win the game challenge left by the late OASIS inventor James Halliday -- where anyone who can win three keys leading to an Easter Egg hidden somewhere in the OASIS will inherit full ownership of the Halliday's invention. I first saw lead actor Tye Sheridan in 2015 in two thematically diverse films like 'Scout's Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse' (MY REVIEW) and 'Dark Places' (MY REVIEW). He then made a strong impression as the young Cyclops in 'X-Men: Apocalypse' (2016). His role here as Wade Watts is bound to launch this young 21-year old actor into super-stardom. Although half of the time, we see him as his avatar Parzival, Sheridan ably carried the whole film on his shoulders in both the action and drama components of his role. His group of friends in the OASIS were a diverse bunch of very skilled video game geeks. Lena Waithe played Helen Harris, whose OASIS identity Aech was a musclebound male techie and Wade's best friend. Win Morisaki and Philip Zhao play Japanese gamers Toshiro and Akihide whose avatars were samurai Daito and ninja Shoto respectively. Olivia Cooke played Samantha Cook, a rebel activist in real life and Wade's cyber crush Art3mis virtually. Although the book does not have a follow-up, it does not seem impossible if we see this group again in a future sequel for further adventures of The High Five.Mark Rylance was not easily recognized in his unkempt long-haired geek make-up as the eccentric James Halliday, the timid genius who developed a virtual world to escape the loneliness of the real world. Simon Pegg played Halliday's only friend and business partner Ogden Morrow, who later became estranged due to their divergent philosophies. Veteran character actor Ben Mendehlson played the main antagonist character Nolan Sorrento, CEO of the Innovative Online Industries or IOI, manufacturers of virtual reality hardware. He hired an entire army of virtual warriors in order to win Halliday's Easter Egg in order for IOI to gain control of the whole OASIS. There was so much subtle tongue-in-cheek humor in his portrayal of a ruthless character. T.J. Miller stole scenes as virtual mercenary i-R0k whom Sorrento hired to do his virtual mayhem. This film was so much fun to watch with all the pop culture references that abound in it. You'd need repeated watching of this film to catch all those little juicy details hidden in the scenes and the dialogue. You will see King Kong, Mecha-Godzilla, Gundam, the Iron Giant in all their glory, and catch glimpses of the Batmobile, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Tony Manero's disco moves and many more. The musical soundtrack was steeped in 1980s pop songs, beginning with Van Halen's 'Jump' from the opening scene, and citations of a-ha and Duran Duran. There were rich references to 1980s movies with mentions of names like John Hughes, Ferris Bueller and Buckaroo Banzai. Parzival's car is a DeLorean from 'Back to the Future.' There was entire elaborate segment dedicated to a tribute to the horror classic 'The Shining' (Stanley Kubrick, 1980), in what is probably the most fun part of the whole film. Watching a film like this in 3D IMAX is very much worth the additional ticket expense. The computer-generated world of OASIS really came alive three-dimensionally for the audience as they are drawn in and immersed into what is practically what the characters were virtually seeing and experiencing in their heads. From the 1970s all the way to the 1990s, Steven Spielberg had given us some of the most engaging adventure films of all time both by young film fans and old -- 'Jaws' (1974), 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' (1977), 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' (1981), 'E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial' (1982), 'Jurassic Park' (1993). It is only now that Spielberg had again handled material that showed that he still had that magic touch when it comes to directing these types of films, making them connect with audiences of all generations. 10/10.",10,132,282,24 March 2018
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," I Think I May Have to Watch This One Again
","Can you really say that you liked a movie even if you do not fully understand the story it just told? After watching this latest film incarnation of John le Carre's 'Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy', I fully agree with several reviewers who said that they know they have seen a cinematic masterpiece, yet cannot grasp the complicated story that just unfolded on the screen. I caught this film mainly because of Gary Oldman's Oscar nomination for Best Actor. He is very subdued, but very good in his characterization of retired agent George Smiley, who was called out of retirement to flush out a Russian mole within their spy organization. The way Oldman really disappears into his roles, I am not really sure what he looks like in real life! In my opinion though, this movie was more of a ensemble cast acting, rather than a showcase for a single actor. Colin Firth, Mark Strong and especially Tom Hardy all shine in their respective roles, which I cannot really label as merely 'supporting.' The film was beautiful to watch, with those imaginative camera angles, the energetic editing (but an slam-bang action film this is NOT), the stark colors of the 1970's set design. Is it the director's fault then that I, who had not read the novel nor seen the Sir Alec Guinness TV- mini-series, did not get the whole detailed story right away? I am reserving my right to judge this film with finality on my second watching.",6,0,1,24 February 2012
The Adventures of Tintin," Great Snakes! This Tintin Adventure was Awesome!
","Ever since I was a kid, I had been aware of this series of adventure- type cartoon books featuring this pale young boy with his short red hair flipped up in front named Tintin. But unusually though, unlike many in my generation, I have to confess that I have never read even one of them. When I heard that Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson had teamed up to create an animated version of Tintin, I knew this was the perfect time for me (and my family) to finally get to know this famous guy.The story follows intrepid young reporter Tintin (Jamie Bell) when a model ship he bought for a pound from a street seller was being relentlessly pursued by a mysterious man named Sakharine (Daniel Craig). Along the way, Tintin crosses paths with the alcoholic Captain Haddock (the versatile Andy Serkis) who was apparently the heir of a huge fortune of gold lost at sea, the very fortune also being sought by Sakharine. This race for the treasure leads Tintin and the Captain in an unexpected adventure of the highest order that spans land, sea and air! This action-packed contest of wills was also laced with most biting and slyly funny Continental humor, mostly care of the bumbling Inspectors Thomson and Thompson.This was simply one of the most visually stunning movies I have EVER seen. The colorful and entertaining title sequence itself already draws you in. The motion capture animation is stepped up 100% from past incarnations as 'Polar Express' and 'Christmas Carol.' This movie is beautiful and exciting at the same time, with just the right hint of nostalgia. The artwork is flawless. The colors were vibrant. The action sequences were exhilarating. The realism of this animated film (Spielberg's first as director) was astounding. You will be impressed by the scenes showing Snowy (Tintin's cute dog), sunsets, the ocean, galleon ships, the airplane, the desert, the falcon, the shattering glass, the battling cranes, all rendered with palpable texture. And we only watched in 2D! Definitely a must-watch for the big screen! 10 stars!",10,0,4,30 November 2011
Fast & Furious 6," My First F&F Film and I Liked It!
","I have not seen a single installment of the 'Fast and Furious' franchise, one of only a few, I am sure. I never got around to watching the first one at all, consequently I never did get to watch the second, nor any of the five. There was very big buzz about the last one 'Fast Five,' but unfortunately I was not able to catch it. Now, this time, since Vin Diesel and Michelle Rodriguez made the effort to come over to our country and grace this film's Premiere here last week (the first Hollywood premiere in Manila). I made it a point to watch 'F&F 6', and I'm glad I did.Now I see what the fuss was all about, and why this franchise has lasted this long and still goes strong. The car chase scenes, on which this franchise's fame lay, were amazingly planned, executed, shot and edited. There was that chase scene on the freeway with a tank, ending with a superhuman midair rescue you simply have got to see. As if that is not enough, the entire last sequence was about cars trying to get a Russian cargo plane from taking off, all the while fighting off the enemies mostly mano a mano. I commend director Justin Lin for these ace pieces of action direction.In between these big action sequences, there are the scenes of the team led by Dom (Vin Diesel) and Brian (Paul Walker) talk about about being a family and never leaving anybody out. Among the members of the gang, Tyrese Gibson stood out as the loquacious Roman, the film's main source of comic relief. His funny one-liners also came fast and furiously hilarious. Matching big and beefy Vin Diesel is big and beefy Dwayne Johnson. The Rock plays a cop, Agent Hobbs, who sought help from Dom's and his team in apprehending another team of mercenary drivers doing terrorist errands led by Owen Shaw (played by Luke Evans). In return for their help, they asked Hobbs to work for their amnesty so they can all go back to the States, instead of hiding in countries without extradition as they are now. The unexpected return of Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), who was apparently thought to have been killed in a previous episode but now was working with the enemy, provides dramatic focus for the characters, particularly Dom. Overall this is one very entertaining and exhilarating film, which I understood and appreciated well even if I have not seen any of the previous films. Well, I am sure fans who have seen all the movies will love it even more than I did since they have known and loved all these characters already. The top-notch action sequences left nothing to be desired, really breath-taking. These heart-stopping stunts are all admittedly downright ridiculous and impossible, but that was why they were all so awesome to watch.",8,1,4,24 May 2013
The Expendables," Slam Bang Action and Nothing More
","This is a movie that does not hide what it was all about. This is most definitely a MAN's movie. The first poster shows an array of firearms and knives surrounding a skull, no doubt this would be a violent action extravaganza. The list of the actors in this project confirm just the same: Stallone, Statham, Li, Lundgren, Couture, Austin, with a couple more superstars: Rourke and Willis.The story is threadbare and overused. A ragtag bunch of American mercenaries were assigned to overthrow a dictator in a South American island country. That sounds like 'The A-Team', I know, but that is the plot as it is. As can be expected, having a multiple big name cast would mean that not everyone would get a fair exposure.Since he is the star, director and writer, Sylvester Stallone got the meatiest part as the leader of the group. He was mumbling his lines as usual, which was fine since it is probably non-essential anyway. His face looks like it is about to melt though. Jason Statham was quite good as the knife expert. He was cool and relaxed in all his fight scenes. Jet Li I felt was wasted, as you cannot see his martial arts moves very well the way his scenes were shot. And unfortunately he was treated as the comic relief! The rest were basically cameos. Dolph Ludgren had an exciting car chase scene which ended in fights with Li and Stallone. Randy Couture and Steve Austin had a great fight scene towards the end. Stallone, Willis and another (uncredited) superstar Arnold Schwarzenegger had a short scene together, which too bad is not really key to the plot. Mickey Rourke's part is not really necessary and had no action whatsoever.You certainly get what you expect here with 'The Expendables.' This movie is alive and kicking when there are action scenes. These are very well-choreographed, exciting, and very highly explosive, be it a car chase, assault, rescue mission. My only beef about the fight scenes is that they were shot too close-up and edited so fast. You do not know who is fighting who in a lot of scenes with many people. You cannot appreciate more the fighting technique employed. However, whenever there would be talk scenes, these were boring and inconsequential, fast-forward material.Action fans will enjoy the action scenes very much. They are excitingly filmed, most the time. You could overlook that these are too incredible really. That final rescue sequence was non-stop slam bang action, as big flames and loud gunshots and explosions were continually in the face and ears of the audience. People who watch this film should not expect anything more intellectual or fancy with this film. They go in for the action alone, and they would definitely not be disappointed.",7,3,8,28 August 2010
The Flowers of War," Heroism Borne Out of Brutality
","I am not really familiar with the details of the Rape of Nanking in the late 1930s. However, people from this side of the globe are very familiar with the suffering brought about by the brutal Japanese Imperial Army throughout Asia. In our country, many movies have shown Japanese brutality during the World War II. I thought I would be ready for this movie.'The Flowers of War' tells the story of a roguish American mortician John Miller (Christian Bale) who was sent to a Catholic church/convent in Nanking to prepare the body of the priest for burial, who was then under siege by the Japanese. When he gets there, he found he also needed to take care of a group of convent girls led by the spirited Shu, a young caretaker boy George, and later, a gaggle of exotic prostitutes led by the classy beauty Yu Mo (Ni Ni). Everyone will go through a touching life-changing story arc that will show how even the most unlikely of people can become heroes in extreme adversity.Director Zhang Jimou returns to form in this movie. He was relentless in the first half we are taken through a continuous barbaric carnage perpetrated by the Japanese soldiers. These parts are reminiscent of the frankly violent blood-spurting 'Saving Private Ryan' beach scene. The terror is very palpable. While the scenes of soldiers being shot and killed were hard to watch, the several minutes of violence to children was even harder to bear! The second half is more dramatic with a some contrived cheesy moments. The character of the kind-hearted Japanese officer Hasegawa was a nice counter-balance to their other heinous acts of atrocity. I also felt the long sequence when a couple of prostitutes sneaking out to retrieve trivial things in their brothel was a rather unnecessary long detour. There will even be a scene that will remind you of Gwyneth Paltrow's body wrap scene in 'Shakespeare in Love.' However, when the film reaches its climax, everything falls back into place and the noble message is delivered on point. This movie may be difficult to watch because of the scenes of violence, but this is worth watching because the story of heroism and redemption was very good, well-told and well-executed.",8,14,17,12 January 2012
Begin Again," Musical Serendipity
","Dan used to be an maverick indie record producer and family man. However, time and luck turn against him in both aspects of his life. Greta is an idealistic singer-songwriter whose musician boyfriend Dave went astray when he gets entangled with the glare and trappings of commercial fame. Dan and Greta meet each other at the very depth of their depression. But this fortuitous meeting would bring about a chain of events which may lead to a mutual reversal of fortunes for these two free-spirited individuals. Will these lost stars align once again with their collaboration? These backgrounds of the lead characters are reminiscent of writer- director John Carney's breakthrough 2006 indie film, the delicate 'Once.' The story was also about musicians who led sad lives until they meet and click musically. The storytelling was propelled by the beautiful songs they sing. In 'Begin Again' though, Carney's first Hollywood film, the setting is upgraded from suburban Ireland to New York City, and the cast is upgraded to A-list stars.Mark Ruffalo perfectly captures the broken character of Dan, gruff exterior and deep-set cynicism. However, he has this goofy charm that makes you actually root for him to dig himself out of his hole. He seems to have genuine chemistry with all his co-stars, a rare quality.Keira Knightley started so well in her career, but lately her talent has not been given the right roles to shine. Greta is such an awesome character for Keira, who I am sure no one even thought could sing so well. Everything she sings here I liked and I would like to hear over and over. Beautiful songs all.Adam Levine plays the erring boyfriend Dave well considering this is his first major movie role. His singing was of course flawless in very catchy songs like the centerpiece tune 'Lost Stars', which is this film's answer to 'Falling Slowly' from 'Once', certainly a contender for Oscar Best Song as well.James Corden plays Greta's best friend in New York Steve. He provides the comic relief very subtly, a very nice guy. Catherine Keener plays Dan's ex-wife Miriam, who made the most of her little screen time. Hailee Steinfeld plays Dan's confused daughter Violet. Cee-Lo also has a marked cameo as one of Dan's former successful talents.Like 'Once', 'Begin Again' is a film that is simply so refreshing and delightful midst all the big and noisy summer blockbusters. The story does not seem so original, that is true. However again, the unbelievably effective cast and the beautiful musical soundtrack both uplift the common story into a much higher level. If the songs speak to you, then you will love this movie. I definitely did. 9/10.",9,4,10,9 July 2014
Megamind," Brad Pitt's Voice Work Excellent, but Overall Just Satisfactory
","The posters and previews did not really attract me to watch this movie. However my sons made me see it with them, so I did. I am wary about Dreamworks animation projects. I was just hoping that it would be a pleasant surprise, like 'How to Train Your Dragon' or 'Kung Fu Panda' were before this.It all starts with a Superman scenario when two babies were sent via rockets to Earth, when their planets were destroyed. One was raised in the lap of luxury and grew up to be the superhero, Metro Man. The other was raised in a prison, ostracized all his life for his big head and blue color, and grew up to be the super-villain, Megamind. As fate would have it, they became arch-nemeses. One day, one of Megamind's hare-brained schemes to destroy Metro Man actually succeeds. However, after he experiences his 'success,' he finds his life empty without someone to fight against.Regarding the artwork, the characters (with no exception) were really very unattractive and unappealing, as they were drawn. I see this as a problem with all Dreamworks projects like 'Dragon', 'Monsters Vs. Aliens', and 'Shark's Tale'. The character Hal/Titan is the worst and most annoying of all. Their Metro City backdrops and special animated effects though were very well-done.As for the voices, the best one belonged to Brad Pitt as Metro Man. It was noble yet cheesy, very on point. Will Ferrell sounded like he had a good time with Megamind, but it was just OK. Tina Fey's voice as the feisty reporter Roxanne did not really reflect her funny personality. These two could have been done just as good by any other voice talent.Overall, this movie was satisfactory, not spectacular. As you can deduce from the short synopsis, this movie is not exactly for kids. There were stretches in the middle when my kids were restless. The success of the jokes were erratic. The script was surprisingly quite adult in its analysis of good and evil, even contemplative at times. I appreciated this and I liked the twists and turns that the story took. I am not sure though if the kids actually got what the movie was really all about behind the silly action sequences.",6,2,8,7 November 2010
The Book Thief," Practically Perfect Book Adaptation
","I read the novel 'The Book Thief' by Markus Zusak because this was required reading for one of my kids in her English class, and I would like to be able to help in case she needed it. For very young readers, it may not be the easiest book to start reading as the beginning chapters were rather mysteriously written, and the experience of any war may not be familiar. Despite a difficult beginning, the book eventually absorbed me in its tale of life in Germany during World War II. The story was innovatively narrated by Death himself. The language used by the author was poetic, rather than straightforward. The author's use of descriptive metaphors was very original and evocative. This made the book an exercise in imagination as you picture the movie in your mind as the less than pleasant story unfolded with the beautiful prose. When the movie came out, we went to watch it to see if our movie in our heads matched the one envisioned by the filmmakers.It is 1939 in Nazi Germany. Liesel Meminger loses her mother and brother, and was brought to foster parents Hans and Rosa Hubermann on Himmel Street. From her beloved foster father Hans, Liesel develops a life-long love affair with the written word. This beautiful obsession happened as she struggled through the difficulties of war, the air raids, and the deaths; even if she had to steal the books she reads. For me, the actors cast did not really exactly match with the way I imagined Liesel, the Hubermanns and the other characters in my head, but they did very well in their assigned roles. Sophie Nelisse, the pretty child actress who played Liesel, did creditably well in her difficult role. She had won an acting award already in her native Canada with her very first film role at age 10. Now 12 years old, with her riveting lead performance here, it looks like she has a promising international career ahead of her as well.Award-winning actors like Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson definitely brought on the acting gravitas required for a serious piece like this. Both of them were so effective in being able to convey their emotions with only their facial expressions, even without a word being said.Special mention has to be given to young Nico Liersch who played Liesel's best friend, Rudy Steiner. He plays his rascal role so naturally and charismatically. Fortunately, Liersch also had excellent chemistry with Nelisse, so we will also cherish the relationship between Rudy and Liesel.On the other hand, Ben Schnetzer, the actor who played Max Vandenburg, I felt was a bit lacking in his performance. Max is a heavier and more dramatically-loaded role than Rudy, yet he failed to connect with me the way Schnetzer portrayed him.The script is actually almost a perfect adaptation of the book by Michael Petroni, which is a good thing for the book's fans. The script shares the same love for words as the book does. The film touches on all the important parts of the book. As directed by Brian Percival, the film unfolds more literally than the book. However, we will care about what happens to Liesel's foster parents, her best friend Rudy, her secret Jew friend in the basement Max, her book benefactress Ilsa Herrmann, and of course, Liesel herself. The horrors of war were still there, but these were shown very sensitively in full consideration of the young audience it targets. Although as in most adaptations, due to the constraints of a reasonable running time, the film skips through many details. In particular, the ending felt rushed as it was shown as a montage of only wordless scenes and dramatic music (by John Williams), with the story told via a voice- over narration. The words used were very eloquent, and can still evoke deep emotion. But those who read the book know that the missing details could have made a more dramatic impact that what was shown.",8,4,7,18 February 2014
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Sheer Irony: A Melodic Bloodbath
","I have heard the soundtrack album of this musical since probably 20 years ago. This was the first I have heard of Stephen Sondheim and his music. After all that time, I have never had the chance of watching Sweeney Todd on stage. So when I heard that Tim Burton is going to have a go at this musical, I just had to go see it. I haven't heard the music for such a long time already, that I was afraid I would have already totally forgotten it.Anyway, my schedule was very tight, so I think I was a little late for the beginning of the movie, however when I entered and heard Anthony sing:'I have sailed the world beheld its wonders from the Dardanells, to the mountains of Peru, But there's no place like London!...'Everything came rushing back. The music was indeed very familiar to me still. Now what is left is to put the music with the visuals...Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham-Carter take on the roles made immortal by Len Cariou and the legendary Angela Lansbury. Honestly, their makeup looked very familiar, as if Edward Scissorhands meets Beatrix Lestrange (of the Harry Potter 5 movie). Talking about Harry Potter, the antagonist roles of the evil Judge Turpin and his Beadle were played by Alan Rickman and Timothy Spall (who both played bad guys Prof. Snape and Pettigrew in HP movies). No doubt everyone in the main cast played their role with relish and gusto. This would include Sacha Baron Cohen as Signor Pirelli, Todd's rival barber. The younger secondary characters Anthony and Joanna (Todd's daughter) were played by newcomers and this fact is quite sorrily evident.This is the story of Benjamin Barker, a gentle and naive barber, who lost his wife, child and his freedom because of the jealous lusty desires of a decrepit Judge Turpin. After 15 years in prison, he sails back to London. He joins up with Mrs. Lovett, who now occupies his old house, baking the 'worst pies in London.' Together, Barker, now going under the name of Sweeney Todd, begins his plans to exact violent revenge on his enemy Judge.When I saw how the story unfolded, and all the bloody details, I wondered about how Stephen Sondheim can use this type of scenario and still manage to give us such melodious and beautiful songs, such as 'Joanna' and 'Pretty Women' which were ironically sung to accompany throat-slashing scenes. This musical is also the original source of the the famous ballad 'Not While I'm Around'. Its place in the story is quite haunting, considering the big effect of this song's message on the ending of the whole movie.Tim Burton is really in his element here. We know him for his visions of the Gothic and the macabre, and this play is so rich of this type of imagery. He was born to make this film as it is right up his alley. He handles the witty and naughty 'A Little Priest' and the humorous yet sad 'By the Sea' masterfully as well.This is definitely not a film for the faint of heart. No wonder it is a rated R-18 film. Even if it were to be expected by someone familiar with the play's storyline, the sheer volume of the blood shed and the manner in which it was shed can still churn the stomach of the weak-livered. This is most certainly one of the bloodiest movies I have seen, matching the bloodbaths in 'Saving Private Ryan' or 'Braveheart.'",8,1,3,17 January 2008
Horrible Bosses," This is Jennifer Aniston's Best Work!
","After 'The Hangover' hit it big two years ago. There had been a lot of similar Rated-R, crude and naughty comedies that have ridden the same successful wave. This year alone, in particular, I feel there had actually been a glut. There was 'Hangover 2', 'Bridesmaids', 'Bad Teacher', and as if a summer could need another one, here comes 'Horrible Bosses.'The film tells the story of three miserable guys stuck with three 'horrible' bosses. So one day, they decide to just go ahead and kill them. And from that premise, the black comedy arises. To cut the long story short, the three guys undergo several adventures and misadventures in order to exact their revenge on these bosses. The script is downright mean, nasty and raunchy.I did not really know the three actors who played the down-and-out guys, except Jason Bateman (vaguely). But the bosses are all-star: a pompous Kevin Spacey, a balding mousy Colin Farrell and a very sexually aggressive Jennifer Aniston. The scenarios with Spacey and Farrell are sort of familiar already and not really too funny. The most hilarious parts for me however are those that involve the lady dentist Dr. Julia Harris (Aniston) and her sexually-harassed assistant Dale (Charlie Day). her performance here is so unlike anything I have seen Jennifer in and she nails this character cold.So if you are not yet tired with this raunchy comedy trend, you can still try to catch 'Horrible Bosses.' For me though, I felt I am already a little bit too full for this type of movie in same season. Maybe next year again.",5,1,3,13 September 2011
The Town," Jeremy Renner Personifies Tension
","The Town' is directed, written and starred in by Ben Affleck. I do not particularly like Ben Affleck. I did not really think I would watch this film. However, when I found out that Jeremy Renner was in it, and with its positive word of mouth, I thought why not check it out.'The Town' is a crime drama set in the Charlestown area of Boston. The story though is not about the crimes per se, but about Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck), the leader of this group of bank robbers. MacRay is tired of the life of crime he is in and wants to get out, but circumstances would not allow him to. When he develops an intimate relationship with Claire (Rebecca Hall), a bank manager of a bank they robbed, he gains further resolve to really get out of it all.While Ben Affleck is still generally dull as the lead actor, he gets his cast to perform very well. Jeremy Renner, excellent as the loose cannon gang member Jem, commands the screen whenever he is in it. Even Gossip Girl Blake Lively unexpectedly turns in a gritty realistic performance as Jem's white trash sister.The action sequences were topnotch. From the first bank robbery scene, then the breathtaking car chase following the second armored car hijack, to the final grand heist in old Fenway Park itself, all of these scenes were executed expertly with excitement and suspense. The best scene overall though was a quiet one, when Jem walks in on Doug and Claire having lunch is a masterpiece of tension. You can really sense the danger as Jem talks to Claire while Doug squirms in his seat.Ben Affleck does better as director than actor in this. He gets the various elements of the film to cohere into a crisp and exciting final product. I did feel though that certain parts went a bit too long. Oscar nominations are already being predicted for this movie, but I think it is still too early to tell. However, Jeremy Renner seem to be a shoo-in for Best Supporting Actor, at least as nominee. He personified that the tension essential to make this film work.",7,1,4,14 October 2010
Shutter Island," Have We Already Seen The Best Picture of 2010?
","'Shutter Island' is an excellent film! From the opening scene, it had me interested. With each scene that unfolded on the screen, that interest does not let up. Something new comes up to confound, to confuse and to obfuscate. The film follows US Marshall Edward Daniels as he investigates the disappearance of one prisoner/patient in the island prison complex for the criminally-insane called Shutter Island. I cannot really say anything more without spoiling it for you. This film needs to be experienced first-hand! This is classic film-making by Director Martin Scorsese. His visuals are just riveting and disturbing. His approach to story-telling is impeccable. Your brain keeps on working while you watch it. I want to watch it again to get all those small details I may have missed, and I know there are many. I think I may have already watched the Best Picture of 2010, and it is only February! Leonardo di Caprio, what can I say? He is such an intense actor. Since his recent series of serious films, from 'The Departed', then 'Blood Diamond', then 'Revolutionary Road', now this, he just keeps on improving his craft. I was sold about how he tackled this most challenging role of Edward Daniels. I think he is on track to finally winning his Academy Award for Best Actor.The supporting cast composed of Mark Ruffalo, Ben Kingsley and the venerable Max von Sydow was very effective. Michelle Williams was haunting and creepy. I cannot even say what their roles are without risking to spoil things. It is that good that way. The film is very original. It is mentally-stimulating. Just the way I like my films.",9,2,7,24 February 2010
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," The Bar is Raised Even Higher
","I do not know what it is about films in the Marvel franchise, but more than often, they can manage to exceed our already high expectations of their films. Just when you thought that 'The Avengers' was already a pinnacle of superhero action film perfection, along comes another one that challenges that position.'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' is more than just an excellent action-packed superhero film. Aside from those big fist fights, gun fights, car chases, it also has piracy on the high seas and gigantic aircraft of mass destruction to add to the mayhem. All of these action scenes were executed perfectly - the stunts, the CG effects, the editing, the set-ups -- no loose ends. Those who found the sound levels of 'The Avengers' too much would find the quality of sound here just right. The directors Anthony and Joe hit all the right notes in their execution of a complex film. We do not feel the two-hour plus running time pass us by.The screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely was able to smoothly tell us about the Cap and the people he loved, along with the history of SHIELD, the history of HYDRA, the history of Black Widow, the history of the Falcon, all on top of a solid politically-charged thriller of a main story. Again, all these multi-layered details were all tucked in neatly, with no significant plot holes to ponder. Chris Evans gets more and more comfortable in playing this good-natured All-American hero. His physical aptitude is of no question in all those high-energy action scenes. More than just his chiseled face and physique though, he also proves he has the acting chops for those unexpectedly emotional dramatic scenes in the film. There was a charming one set in a museum, and another one in a hospital bedside, featuring a surprise guest cameo.Scarlett Johansson is bad-ass and kick-ass as the Black Widow, Natasha Romanoff. She had a lot more complex stunts to do here over those that wowed us in The Avengers. We also get to know Natasha a little better - - her background, her work ethic, her skills -- but just enough to whet our interest even more about her mysterious character.Samuel L Jackson reprises his recurrent role as Nick Fury. Again we get to see Nick Fury more in action here as ever. There was a particularly exciting sequence where Nick's car was ambushed in the middle of city traffic that was jaw-dropping in its execution.It was really good to see Robert Redford back in a big role in a mainstream film. He plays Secretary Alexander Price who oversaw SHIELD for the US government, the man who picked Nick Fury to head SHIELD. Redford still had that cool and collected touch of class that made him a big box-office star in the early 1970s.There will be new characters introduced. Anthony Mackie gets to be introduced as ex-soldier Sam Wilson, who will later don those awesome metal wings as Falcon. The beautiful Emily VanCamp is first introduced to us as Steve's next door neighbor, the shy nurse Sharon Carter, but she will also have surprises up her sleeve later. I am not really sure if there is still any surprise about the identity of The Winter Soldier, but I will just leave that for you to find out when you watch this film. You should really do so.",10,5,15,27 March 2014
Life of Pi," Sanitized Version of the Book with Melodramatic Touches
","I have just finished reading the book the other day, and today I got to watch the film version. With the book still so fresh in my head, I went into the cinema with very high expectations. This is specially so after reading and hearing reviews which call Ang Lee's cinematic masterpiece visually comparable to 'Avatar' or emotionally comparable to 'The Little Prince,' as well as all of the awards buzz.The book for me was a pleasant though slow read because of the lengthy wordy, even flowery, descriptions Yann Martel uses for his languid reflection on zoo life, his comparative study of Hindu, Christian and Moslem philosophy, and of course, his survival tale at sea by a teenager and a Bengal tiger sharing one lifeboat. It waxes philosophical in the beginning, then waxes fantastical in the middle, before settling for dry reality at the end. While a movie could probably improve on the imagery for each scene, there are several key parts of the novel that would entail a lot of narration. On the big screen, too much narration cannot be too good.My first assumption turned out to be true. The cinematography and visual effects were expectedly first rate and excellent. Those camera angles were breathtaking. The colors were very vibrant. The special effects regarding animals were realistic for the most part, especially the land mammals, particularly Richard Parker. Though I have to say that the water creatures were too obviously computer-generated, not too good. A most triumphant sequence in the film for me were the scenes on the floating green island of algae and meerkats. I thought that was ideally visualized and executed, so much better than that chapter of the book.My second assumptions also turned out true. A lot of the story needed to be narrated by an adult Pi Patel as he was being interviewed by a novelist researching for his next book. These bookending present day scenes were pretty dry for me. The whole last chapter of the book when Pi was interviewed by the Japanese shipping officials was all one long narration only without supporting imagery. All of this talky narration may be boring for some people. In order to make the film appeal to more people, Ang Lee spares us from gory details which the book was not averse to describing in graphic detail. In the film, the screen time of the zebra, orangutan and hyena was very short. For all the brutality that was supposed to have happened on board, Ang's lifeboat remains almost pristine white. I thought that was quite merciful of Ang. I wish I could also say the same for some sappy melodramatic scenes, like Richard Parker laying his head on Pi's lap, which were not in the book.Overall, this film version of 'Life of Pi' is very good, but it can be disappointing for people who have read the book. It was a loyal albeit sanitized version of the book, which is not really a bad thing. The book was not exactly inspirational to me, more educational actually. For this film, Ang Lee seemingly aspired to make this movie inspirational, and these obvious efforts may prove to backfire for some audiences.",7,16,24,9 January 2013
Ocean's Thirteen," Fun romp
","I watched this, even though I have not seen Ocean's 11 nor 12. I only know a bit about the basic plots, but nothing specific. But truth to tell, I enjoyed this movie. It is fun. Even though, you really need to check your disbelief at the door. Don't take it seriously. I know the casino tricks they did were not possible in the real world, but it was fun to see Al Pacino's character get his comeuppance. It was great to see all these stars together, and I feel they all got to be exposed with seemingly equal screen time. I liked Matt Damon's and Carl Reiner's characters the best. I felt they could have chosen a more appropriate actress than Ellen Barkin.I don't really know the personalities of each member of the gang, nor their talents. I think was where I missed out, on some of the small stuff and inside jokes. But I guess, the whole story was still there for me, so I hope I did not really miss that much.",6,1,2,21 June 2007
Tangled," Exciting Action and Magical Poignant Scenes as Disney Goes CGI
","'Tangled' is Disney's latest film, but unusually it is not a highly hyped as previous Disney films, at least where I live. I did not really like the nondescript generic title, which does not say anything much about the movie at all or even hint at its creator, Disney. Upon watching the movie, we see a spin on the fairy tale of Rapunzel. Rapunzel becomes a princess here, in the Disney tradition. The male protagonist is played by a charming (again in the Disney tradition) outlaw Flynn Ryder. The elements of the Rapunzel story are all there: the long hair, the locking up in the tower, the teardrop at the end... But Disney gives these things a very interesting magical back story (again in true Disney form). To make the boys come and see the movie, they include an exciting and funny action story with Flynn Ryder character, complete with thugs and chases.I personally like the non-speaking animal characters a lot -- the cute little chameleon Pascal and the mighty royal steed Maximus. I never did like those other noisy annoying sidekicks in previous films too much. The songs are not too memorable unfortunately. They tend to sound alike already, don't they? The action can tend to be a little graphic here, meaning there are lacerations and stabbing with blood, and you actually see what happens to the witch when she falls out of the tower -- unprecedented stuff. It is in fact the first Disney princess film to get a PG rating.It is a marked improvement over 'Princess and the Frog', Disney's last film. It is not to the level of 'Beauty and the Beast', 'Little Mermaid' and 'Mulan', but 'Tangled' is a landmark film in Disney history, as they finally enter into 3D CG animation territory. The effect of this animation vastly improves the quality of action scenes (like the breaking of the dam) and the magical effect of the poignant scenes (like the floating paper lanterns). This film is well worth its price of admission. It is fun, funny, exciting, romantic and touching, everything you will be looking for in a Disney animated feature film.",7,2,4,19 January 2011
Interstellar," Sci-Fi with a Big Heart
","The Earth in the near future is a shell of what it used to be. The plant life is dying. The very soil that used to sustain it is destroying it. There are some underground efforts headed by Prof. Brand (Michael Caine) called Lazarus to find an alternative world to settle in somewhere out there in the vast reaches of space. Three such potential worlds have been found beyond a black hole near Saturn.Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) is a retired NASA engineer who had been chosen to pilot this effort to seek out and investigate these alternative planets. Despite the stiff objections of his 10-year old daughter Murphy (Mackenzie Foy), he accepts the mission and lifted off together with his crew of three scientists, Amelia (Anne Hathaway), Doyle (Wes Bentley) and Romilly (David Gyasi). From there, we are brought on an unparalleled adventure of space, time and humanity by a master who is probably the most mentally-challenging writer and director in the film industry today, Christopher Nolan. Front and center in this spectacular sci-fi film is the timeless bond between a father and his daughter. The poetic story he has written is multi- layered and emotional, despite its scientific jargon and bleak settings.As with his other projects, Nolan works with some of the best technical talents, many of whom are award-winners in their fields. Everyone on this team are guaranteed at least Oscar nominations for their work in this film, and they may in fact all actually win.Film editor Lee Smith, sound engineers Gregg Landaker and Gary Rizzo and musical scorer Hans Zimmer together effectively create excitement and drama. The cinematography of Hoyte van Hoytema is breathtaking especially in those wide landscape shots, both on earth and on those other planets. The visual effects are innovative as ever, particularly in the third act where a whole new dimension was created. Production designer Nathan Crowley had some nifty ideas for his futuristic props. The circular design of the mother ship Endurance was beautiful in its symmetry. The designs of the robotic sidekicks TARS and CASE are in no way similar those in Star Wars. Matthew McConaughey continues his streak of acting excellence which was just capped by an Oscar earlier this year. Michael Caine was as good as he could be expected to be. However, I found his final speech too garbled to be understood well, and it contained an important plot point. Anne Hathaway's role is a bit of a puzzle for me. While she was actually managed to be credible as a scientist, she had a rather cheesy monologue that seemed out of place when it was delivered.Three talented actresses portray the character of Murphy Cooper at different ages: Mackenzie Foy, Jessica Chastain and Ellen Burstyn. Foy goes way beyond what she was required to do in her two previous hit films the 'Breaking Dawn' films and 'The Conjuring'. Chastain is such a riveting presence as ever, and it was good to see her again after her long break after 'Zero Dark Thirty' and 'Mama.'. Oscar winner Burstyn's singular big scene made me tear up.In the second hour, I was surprised to see a special, heretofore uncredited, big name guest star portray one of the pioneer Lazarus astronauts, Dr. Mann. This was more than a mere cameo appearance, as his character had a critical role to play in one of the many twisting episodes of this story.From 'Memento', then 'The Prestige' to 'Inception', Nolan had gone for the extremes in terms of plot development. His work is not always easily comprehended on first watch. They are thought-provoking and demanding in terms of a viewer's patience and concentration. 'Interstellar' joins this stellar list, and we are brought to yet another dimension of time and space. 10/10.",10,40,77,6 November 2014
Pacific Rim," Maybe Clunky in Parts, But Great as a Whole
","I was so ready not to like 'Pacific Rim'. It seemed just like another one of those 'giant robot movies that are just all noise and nothing else. Fortunately though, it was a good thing that it was the only movie beginning when I got to the mall this morning. This is so much better than the 'Transformers' clone I was afraid it would be.'Pacific Rim' takes place in the year 2020 (not really in the very far future, isn't it?) and the world is under attack from gigantic monsters coming from ocean depths called Kaiju. As the tag line tells us, 'to fight the monsters, we created monsters of our own.' These are in the form of so-called giant mechanical fighting soldiers called Jaegers, controlled by the skills of human controllers. The human team dedicated to fighting these destructive creatures are based in Hong Kong. The soldiers were all hot-headed and macho heroic types, led by Stacker (Idris Elba). The scientists were portrayed as nerdy and caricature-ish comic relief, led by Dr. Newton (Charlie Day). The central character is Raleigh Becket, who previously retired from the Jaegers when his brother and partner died in battle. He was portrayed by Charlie Hunnam, who was not too familiar to me, just another generic blonde Hollywood hunk. The face could have been interchangeable with any of the other Caucasian fighters in there. The lead female character is Mako Mori, an aspiring Jaeger fighter, with a painful past. She is portrayed by Japanese actress Rinko Kikuchi, who we should remember was nominated for Best Supporting Actress back in 2006 for her role in 'Babel'. Here, she appeared to be confused on how to properly portray her role, so she did not come across too strongly as her character should have beenDespite these casting and characterization flaws though, the movie as a whole still turned out very well. Director Guillermo del Toro faced such a challenge to execute a script that dangerously flirted with disaster, deriving obvious comparisons with, not only 'Transformers,' but also 'Godzilla', 'Real Steel', 'Armageddon'. He succeeded to create within this borrowed material enough heart to make audiences root for the good guys and care if they save the day or not. When I was watching as the movie went along, it did matter too much anymore that the acting was not too good, or that the scenes looked familiar, or that the lines get corny. The movie was actually engrossing and entertaining. The special effects were of epic proportions. The whole thing worked as a whole, and that is what matters in the end.",7,14,34,11 July 2013
American Sniper," Debilitated by Desensitization
","In recent years, there is at least one war movie set in the Middle East that catches Oscars' attention. There was 'The Hurt Locker,' 'Zero Dark Thirty,' and 'Lone Survivor.' This year, it is 'American Sniper,' which is nominated for six Oscars, including Best Picture.The title refers to Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper), a real-life Navy Seal who served during the war against Iraq from 2003-2009. He was a Texan cowboy who decided he wanted to do more for his country as a soldier. During his training, it is discovered that he has a particular talent for being a sniper. He subsequently had four tours of duty in six years, notoriously credited with a record 160 confirmed kills (probably even more in reality). On the other end, he was neglecting his young family Stateside -- his wife Taya (Sienna Miller) and his kids. An injury in his last mission led to his forced retirement. He realizes he cannot get back to living a normal life anymore.Director Clint Eastwood had directed introspective war films before, the lyrical 'Letters from Iwo Jima' (2006) being a personal favorite. Being a Eastwood movie, the story of 'American Sniper' (based on Chris Kyle's own memoirs) was told in a very straight-forward manner, not too much cinematic excess. The war scenes in this film are very well-shot, with excellent editing and sound mixing. It does not shirk from the violence, but there was no overkill on the gore. The climactic sniper scene (a spectacular 2,100 yard kill) and its dusty aftermath is really a memorable one, very exciting and exhilarating in execution. The last thirty minutes or so dealing with Kyle's post-traumatic stress disorder were very touching. This is where Bradley Cooper best displays the acting chops which earned him his nominations for Best Actor from various award-giving bodies, Oscar included. This is already Cooper's third Oscar nomination in a row after 'Silver Lining Playbook' and 'American Hustle'. Aside from the fact that Cooper absolutely dominates this film with his nuanced performance, the patriotic fervor inspired by this film may also work in his favor.With the title alone, expect to watch a very American film -- a movie clearly made for its flag, country and ideals. While it has been accused of being pro-war propaganda, you will actually pick up Clint Eastwood's anti-war sentiments along the way. (Oh, you will notice something odd about Chris and Taya's baby, but don't let it bother you too much.) 8/10.",8,7,24,21 January 2015
The Devil Wears Prada," Great Camera Work
","I had some lag time yesterday, so I snuck over to the movie house to watch 'The Devil Wears Prada.' It must be its third week already here and the theater was not empty that afternoon, to its credit. It has some innovative camera-work. The opening sequence of Anne Hathaway and other girls preparing to go to work looked great. The sequence of Anne Hathway wearing all these different designer clothes while weaving in and out of pedestrian traffic on the way to her office was also very nicely shot. Using Anne Hathaway for this film made it feel like another Princess Diaries sequel at times, admittedly.Meryl Streep, what can I say, another good performance, as usual. This character, she has done something like this before, hasn't she? It feels familiar...or have we simply watched her so many times?Overall, not a waste of time. Obviously geared more for a female audience, who I am sure would love to have those dresses, bags and accessories for themselves.",6,1,3,12 September 2006
Southpaw," Gyllenhaal the Great
","Billy Hope is the light heavyweight champion of the world with a 43-0 record. One day, as a result of his uncontrollable violent temper, tragedy after tragedy hits him and his family until he is left with nothing -- not his fortune, not his career, not his family. Despondent and desperate to get his life back, Billy swallows his pride and seeks the assistance of trainer Tick Wills to train him back to fighting form.'Southpaw' is an acting showcase for its lead actor Jake Gyllenhaal. Last year in the film 'Nightcrawler', Gyllenhaal gave us all the creeps with his very realistic portrayal of sociopathic pseudo-video journalist Louis Bloom. He was overlooked at the Oscars of the Best Actor nomination he clearly deserved. With this meaty role, Gyllenhaal set out to prove that that his transformative performance last year was not a fluke at all.His performance here as Billy Hope is another triumph of his very serious and committed method acting style. Here, Gyllenhaal again undergoes a total physical transformation into a grizzled prizefighter with a buff hardened physique, scarred face and swollen eye. We feel every ache of his weary body as he shuffles in his gait. His speech is already slurred with probable nerve damage. We see and sense the ravages of his vicious sport on him.He captured the character of an impulsive man who was not too savvy in life, and easily driven to violently angry tendencies. As Billy's world collapses around him, Gyllenhaal brings us all down to his hell with him. We totally see the unraveling of a man until a mere shadow of him remained. Then we would witness how he humbles himself as he tries to bring the shattered pieces of his life back together again. This was in addition to all the pounding he had in the boxing ring itself. This was truly an acting tour de force by Gyllenhaal which simply cannot be ignored.The actors in supporting roles all share in Gyllenhaal's shine. Despite her name being so prominent in the poster, Rachel McAdams appeared on screen only for a very short time. In that limited time, we clearly see the effect of her strong character Maureen on her husband Billy. Bespectacled little Oona Laurence plays their spirited daughter Leila. Gyllenhaal and Laurence share some pretty intensely emotional scenes together.Forest Whitaker plays Tick Wills, the tough disciplinarian of a trainer whom Billy chose to bring him back on track. I thought it was clever how they even include Whitaker's left eye into the story. Curtis '50 Cent' Smith plays Billy's fair-weather manager Jordan Mains. He really has this sleazy vibe about him with his flashy smile and shiny suits.Director Antoine Fuqua effectively wrung all the right emotions out of this story. The storytelling is well-paced and the camera work is compelling. The fight scenes were well-choreographed and executed on screen -- very brutal, bloody, all with high tension. The first person point of view during the fights puts you right in the midst of all the action.The musical score contributes so much to the drama of this film. This is also the last film James Horner scored before his untimely demise in a plane crash recently. We also hear Eminem rap in the soundtrack. It is interesting to note that Eminem was actually the original choice to play Billy Hope.Boxing is a common sport tackled in movies because of its inherent drama. 'Rocky', 'Raging Bull', 'Million Dollar Baby' and 'The Fighter' easily come to mind as among the best of them ever made. This is why we may feel we have seen this story In 'Southpaw' told in another way before. However, the grippingly honest acting of Jake Gyllenhaal definitely set this film apart from others. He made 'Southpaw' a most extraordinary boxing film to watch. 8/10.",8,98,135,23 July 2015
Ant-Man," Size Does Not Matter
","I was not really aware of a Marvel character named Ant-Man until recently when articles and trailers about this film began coming out. I was not really that excited until I learned that he was actually one of the original Avengers, then that really got my interest piqued to go watch this one and learn about this previously unfamiliar superhero.Hank Pym was a noted scientist who discovered how to reduce the distance between atoms, enabling objects to be shrunk. Pym suppressed his discovery because of its dangers, which led to the death of his wife. Obsessed, his protégé Darren Cross eventually develops his own shrinking technology but with less than noble purposes in mind. In order to prevent potential disaster, Pym decided to recruit Scott Lang, an electronics engineer turned petty burglar, to steal Cross' Yellowjacket project. To be able to achieve this mission, Pym, along with his daughter Hope van Dyne, trained Lang to become a micro- superhero who can communicate and command ants to do his bidding -- the Ant-Man.I did not know anything about the Ant-Man, his origin and abilities going in, but this film made me a new fan of this cool superhero. Director Peyton Reed only had mostly comedies like 'Bring It On' (2000), 'Down with Love' (2003) and 'The Break-Up' (2006) in his resume. But with his first foray into the superhero genre, he totally made 'Ant-Man' an exciting and riveting film that holds your attention from beginning to end with its excellent action and crackling humor. Reed took over from original director/scriptwriter Edward Wright, who dropped out of the project citing creative differences with Disney. For me, the casting of 46 year old Paul Rudd in the lead role came totally from left field. Since his breakthrough role as Josh in 'Clueless' (1995), Rudd was only relegated playing mainly supporting roles in small unmemorable comedies. However, like his 'Parks and Recreation' co-star Chris Pratt's success as Peter Quill/Star Lord before him, Rudd actually fit right into character as Scott Lang. Rudd had that good-boy charm which was able to make us sympathetic to this small-time crook desperately wanting to do good for the sake of his daughter Cassie (played by Abby Ryder Fortson). Evangeline Lilly proved that the action skills she showed as the elf Tauriel in the last two Hobbit films were no fluke. Her Hope van Dyne is fierce with attitude, with toned arms and shoulders to boot. I do take exception to her annoying hairstyle that was reminiscent of that worn by Dallas Bryce Howard on 'Jurassic World'. What's up with that 'Dora'-do with the bangs and Hollywood nowadays?The role of Hank Pym could have been dry and didactic in the hands of another actor, but Michael Douglas really made this character vital and interesting. His sense of humor was on point. His was the character that was connected with everyone else being the original Ant-Man, and he had excellent working chemistry with everyone: Scott, Hope and villain Darren Cross (played by Corey Stoll).Michael Peña, David Dastmalchian and rapper T.I. played a comical trio of petty crooks with whom Scott hung around. They provide additional humor to the proceedings, especially when things get serious towards the climax. Bobby Cannavale played a clueless cop Paxton who is now the new husband of Scott's ex-wife Maggie (Judy Greer), and step father to Cassie. His character made Scott's life considerably more complicated.The technical aspects of this film were top rate, particularly the amazing visual effects. I really liked the scenes of Ant-Man interacting with the different types of ants. The fight scene of Ant-Man vs. a special guest Avenger was also very well-executed. Those scenes in little Cassie's room where there was a carpeted play area with a toy Thomas train running on its tracks was way better than how it looked in the trailer. The expert film editing was seamless even as scenes (and the sizes of the characters) were shifting so quickly. Aside from mentions of Stark, S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Avengers, there were also two scenes in the end credits (one mid-credit, and another one at the very end) which reveal how Ant-Man will fit into the current Marvel Cinematic Universe situation. Unlike the rather disappointing, heavy- handed 'Avengers: Age of Ultron' right before it, 'Ant-Man' was entertaining beyond my expectations. Marvel does it again! 9/10.",9,13,29,16 July 2015
21 Jump Street," Unexpectedly Funny Remake, Not Bad At All
","After the uneven, not-so-good results of other remakes of 80s TV series like 'Charlie's Angels,' 'Miami Vice,' or 'The A-Team,' I was not really expecting to like this remake of '21 Jump Street.' This is especially since it was going to be a comedy, which usually mocks the original, instead of pay tribute to it. However, with critics fawning all over it with rave reviews, I was compelled to give it a chance.Like the original TV series that inspired it, a couple of young-looking cops -- fat nerd Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and dimwit jock Jenko (Channing Tatum) -- are given the assignment to go undercover in a high school to investigate the proliferation of designer drugs. The film follows their misadventures as the case also challenges them individually and tests their friendship. After raunchy comedies had their heyday last year (with 'Hangover 2,' 'Bridesmaids,' 'Horrible Bosses'), the gross-out gags here were tame in comparison. I did not enjoy seeing high school kids being bullies or drug addicts or foul-mouths. However, the chemistry between the two leads, and the heart of the storyline about their friendship did make a difference. The surprise climactic cameo guest appearances were very welcome indeed, though I was disappointed about how that ended.I have not seen 'Superbad' which launched Jonah Hill into comic superstardom. I only knew him from his more serious Oscar-nominated turn in 'Moneyball.' He is quite funny as Schmidt. He was not afraid to make fun of himself. Anyone who would not be embarrassed about running around in a dorky green Peter Pan costume while chasing criminals should be given top props. Channing Tatum is more known as a romantic lead ('Step Up') or action hero ('GI Joe'), so he was the unknown quantity in this movie. While his straight man act is quite unexpectedly okay, he still looked a bit uncomfortable in a lot of scenes.Overall, this film was OK. It was a hilarious and fun ride in general, and it had a heart amidst all that. Warning though that you would have to go through rough patches of obscenities and drug scenes involving high school kids which may not really sit well with all audiences.",6,2,5,1 May 2012
Captain America: The First Avenger," The Trailer Showed Us Too Much!
","Captain America is probably the cheesiest of all the Marvel superheroes, with his red-white and blue costume and all. Maybe that was why this was the last solo Avenger movie to be released before the big Unified movie next summer. This hero was really very dated, so they had to go 'period' on him and tackle his origin in World War II era. I do not think there can be a second solo Captain America film after this. I think it will really be difficult to create cool solo movie about the Captain in the modern time.Although the face looked a bit awkward, the computer-edited scrawny body of pre-serum Steve Rogers was the most impressive visual effect in the movie for me. It looked very realistic and Chris Evans effectively captured that character's good heart and gallantry. The rest of the special effects in the movie were merely variations of effects we have seen before in all of these super hero films we have been seeing lately.Don't get me wrong. This is not really a bad movie. In fact, if you like old-fashioned style movie-making, this one was quite a spectacle in set and costume design for the 1940s. The camera work and the color palette was also very well done to bring us back to those war years. Behind Chris Evans, the supporting cast led by Tommy Lee Jones, Dominic Cooper, Hugo Weaving and Stanley Tucci was also very good. Leading lady Hayley Atwell was a little like a young Geena Davis. Their acting with a sense of humor effectively keeps Chris Evans' heroic posturings from becoming completely corny.The main limitation of this film is the very limited story. I felt it was just prolonged by repeatedly redundant war scenes pitting men (led by CA) vs. the robo- cop-looking, laser-gun toting army of the Red Skull. There also seems to be very limited things that Captain America was capable of doing, well, aside from miraculously escaping everything the enemy shot or hurled at him using his mighty shield. Ultimately however, I felt disappointed because I think the trailer already showed us too much. There was nothing much else in the movie that wasn't already seen in the trailer. There was only that exciting ending in Times Square and the Avengers clip at the end of the credits that buoyed up the day.",6,2,8,28 July 2011
American Hustle," Now This is Great Camp!
","Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale)is a con artist who, together with his partner-in-crime sexy Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams), was conscripted by over-eager FBI agent Richie diMaso (Bradley Cooper) to hatch a complicated con to trap crooked politicians, including New Jersey mayor Carmel Polito (Jeremy Renner). In the meantime, Irving has to keep his incendiary wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) on a leash or else his plot will be blown wide open.Everything about this movie is overblown and over the top, so downright entertaining. I enjoyed watching this film about con artists out- conning each other. There was so much fun watching the out-of-this- world hairstyles and over-acting of each of the main cast (all Oscar pedigreed), so unlike anything we have seen them in. Christian Bale had gotten so much out of his Batman shape for this role as the Jewish conman with the elaborate comb-over hairdo. Amy Adams was no Princess Giselle in her constantly cleavage-revealing dresses. It was quite a hoot seeing Bradley Cooper in hair curlers, going more bananas than his role in The Hangover. Too bad there was too little of Jeremy Renner in his teased-up bouffant hairstyle.The best performer here is Jennifer Lawrence in a supporting role that is not directly within the main plot, yet she does so well to steal the thunder from her other co-stars by being so audacious and wild. This girl is really so versatile. It is no wonder that she is already being touted by critics to be the 'next Meryl Streep'! This is another quirky masterpiece from the director of 'The Silver Linings Playbook', David O. Russel. If you like great camp, this is the film to catch.",8,2,6,2 January 2014
Incendies," Excellent Story Told the Best Possible Way
","I knew about this movie because it was one of the nominees for Best Foreign Language Film at this year's Oscar Awards. 'Incendies' (or 'Scorched' in English) is from Canada, with the dialog mainly in French and several Middle Eastern languages. I am thankful that this movie got that Oscar nomination, or else I would have missed a very well-plotted and executed dramatic film.This movie starts very slowly with the reading of a very strange will. Upon her death, a mother instructs her twin children to deliver mysterious two mysterious letters to their father and a brother they never knew. Only upon accomplishment of this request will she allow a tombstone with her name engraved to be placed on top of her grave. This quest brings the twins Jeanne and Simon out of the comforts of Montreal, Canada into the harsher world of Lebanon as they discover the intricately tragic life their mother had.Despite the slow pace, the story is very compelling as the story shifts from the present into the past and back following the life of Nawal Marwan, and her children's quest. You will intently follow the progression of the story as facts unfold piece by piece until the jaw- dropping major revelations towards the end. The Director handles the story with much control such that the audience's interest and attention are held to the very end. This story was told in the best possible way.An excellent film! Compared to the eventual Oscar winner 'In A Better World,' I would say that this film 'Incendies' was a better film.",8,2,10,21 April 2011
The Bourne Ultimatum," Action-PACKED!!!
","This is one of those rare third episodes that really lives up to the first two. Very very good indeed! The action begins even before the beginning credits. Then, throughout the movie, this action is relentless. Those motorcycle and foot chase scenes in streets and houses of Tangiers and the car chase scenes on the streets of New York City are really editing masterpieces. Very exciting! The direction of Paul Greengrass does not disappoint. It was breathtaking. All the scenes are important. There is no wasted time.As with the first two installments, there is very little downtime in this. In fact, the downtime is very similar to the first two, where Bourne is in the company of a female, and washes up.Honestly, during the first Bourne movie, 'The Bourne Identity', I did not think that Matt Damon would be a good action star. In fact, I believe I did not watch that one until I watched and was very impressed with the second installment 'The Bourne Supremacy'. Matt is really very good and convincing as Bourne, in all three. In this one, the drama was more intense as Bourne comes into information that leads him from Moscow, Paris, London, Madrid, Tangiers, and New York, back to the very facility where his new violent life began. Matt's talents as a dramatic actor balances perfectly with his physical prowess in the amazing stunts.I think this is really a great action and espionage trilogy I would probably watch all over again, together, one day. While the trajectory of Bourne's character arc is clear to me, I would like to note more the other characters, like those of Joan Allen and Julia Stiles, who played important roles and character development in all three movies.",9,1,2,7 August 2007
Rush," A Winning Film About Winning
","I almost passed on watching 'Rush' because I am not really a fan of F1 car racing. However, very positive word of mouth egged me to squeeze it into my schedule. The buzz proved true -- this is one excellent film.Austrian Niki Lauda is a straight-laced, super-serious and introverted man, already a world champion the year before. British James Hunt is a happy-go-lucky, smoking and drinking, and gregarious ladies man, looking for his first major title. During the 1976 F1 season, Niki Lauda was leading all the way on total points until a devastating event threatened not only his crown, but his life. Can he summon enough will to fight the mortal odds and recover in order to race to the finish, or will James Hunt just be handed the championship cup of his dreams on a silver platter?Even if we only see Chris Hemsworth's face in the posters as James Hunt, this film was more about Niki Lauda, played with devastating realism by Daniel Bruhl. The conflict between two racing arch-nemeses with contrasting personalities seemed to be too ideal a story to be true, but amazingly this film indeed was inspired by a real events. We would witness their relationship evolve from jealousy, enmity, challenge, admiration to respect.Their relationships with the women in their lives were so well-executed in order to further delineate our two main characters off the track. James and his whirlwind marriage to New York-based model Suzy (Olivia Wilde) again contrasted perfectly with Niki and his calculated marriage to the elegant Marlene (Alexandra Maria Lara). The racing scenes were very intense, so well-shot. Those scenes when you see the track in the point of view of the driver. You can smell not only the gas and the fumes, but the adrenaline rush in the air. You can feel the real danger as past accidents were shown in ominous graphic detail. These scenes will definitely be showered technical Oscar nominations for cinematography, editing, sound and sound effects mixing. Director Ron Howard takes full advantage of the inherent drama in these events to create a very tense film, not only on the race tracks, but also in their personal lives and their philosophies about winning. Even if I did not know Lauda and Hunt, I was drawn into their story complete with all the ingredients of epic action, drama, and romance. Howard does not lose control of his material as everything fell in its right place in the gripping final cut of the film.",9,2,4,23 September 2013
Oblivion," The Year's First Real Contender for Oscar Consideration
","I knew nothing about the story of 'Oblivion' when I went in the theater, but when I came out I was completely awed by this movie. This is the first film this year that I feel is a real contender for Oscar nominee consideration. The story is intelligent without being too 'Inception'-like in its telling and development. The setting is the future after aliens have destroyed the Earth. Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) is a technician who fixes drones or 'Wall- E'-like flying robot police gofers of that time. He works with with his partner Vika (Andrea Riseborough) and they report to a talking head on their computer named Sally (Melissa Leo). He keeps having flashbacks of going around the observation deck of the Empire State Building with a woman. One day, he rescues a female crew member of a pod that crash-landed named Julia (Olga Kurylenko), who could be connected with his past. A band of human rebels (led by Morgan Freeman and Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) gives Jack an insight on his real nature. I could not divulge anymore details so as not to spoil your enjoyment of this must-see film.The technical aspects of this film were flawless. The cinematography by Claudio Miranda was breathtaking, and the director really takes time with these beautiful imagery. The art direction for this futuristic setting, from the stylish tech towers to the ruins of Manhattan, were all very well done. That transparent flying machine they use is radical in design and movement. The visual effects, so integral for science fiction films like this, were very subtle, not obtrusive at all. The atmospheric musical score was awesome, from the big orchestral sweeping ones for grandeur to those small quiet rhythmic ones for suspense.Tom Cruise does very well in this movie as the central character Jack. He does not overact this time. On the contrary, he was quite unusually reserved in his approach, underplaying, which was perfect for his character. I am not exactly thinking of an acting nomination or anything though but he is so right for the role. Freeman and the exotic Bond girl also do well in their smaller supporting roles. OK, there are some derivative scenes which may remind you of 'Star Wars' or 'Planet of the Apes.' But more important than those observations, writer-director Joseph Kosinski really had a good story and he tells it very well indeed. He knows how to maximize the talents of his crew to create this unassuming but excellent sci-fi masterpiece. Highly recommended! .",9,5,20,11 April 2013
Watchmen," From Someone Who Has Not Read the Book
","'Watchmen' is an obviously ambitious movie. They are gathering of superheroes in the fictional modern world where Richard Nixon was still US President well into the 1980s. Director Zach Snyder (who burst into the scene in a big way with '300') ups his ante with more violence, gore, bloodshed and a considerably more complex inter-weaving multiple story lines.It is really overwhelming for someone who has not read the so-called 'best graphic novel in the world,' and thus have no idea who these characters are at the start. But you know what, the innovative title credits sets the mood right off. And later on, you do learn about each character very well enough to care about them towards the middle and end.I am still not really clear on what the superpowers of the mysterious Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) and innate good guy Nite Owl II (Patrick Wilson)up to now, but I would know what kind of person they are by the way these topnotch actors have essayed these complex characters. Mr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup) is a buff and unabashedly naked blue CG image almost throughout the whole film, yet it was still very effective in conveying this super-being's thought processes, despite his blank eyes. The raw physicality and conflicted character of The Comedian was very well limned by actor Jeffrey Dean Morgan.The main antagonist Ozymandias I felt was the weak link in the cast. As played by Matthew Goode, he did not really look like a menacing super-villain nor did he even look like 'the smartest man' on earth that he supposedly was. Malin Akerman had a lot riding on her as the main female character Silk Spectre II. She is quite sexy and all, but somehow her performance as a superhero was not too convincing.Overall, it was a good enough introduction to the ultra-violent world of the Watchmen for the uninitiated. But this movie is not really for everybody. The younger male demographic is definitely the target audience, despite the overt frontal exposures of Mr. Manhattan. As far as graphic novels go, I still prefer 'Sin City' and '300'. I have to confess that the violence content of 'Watchmen' went a bit beyond my comfort limit.",6,4,14,5 March 2009
Man of Steel," Excellent Reboot, but Too Reminiscent of 'Superman II'
","'Man of Steel' gives us a twist in the usual way the story of Superman has been told. We see a number of scenes of Clark as a bullied child struggling to cope with and control his special powers. We see young Clark as some anonymous worker, hitchhiking from odd job to odd job. We see Lois Lane meet Clark in one of his odd jobs in the Arctic, not as a mild-mannered reporter at the Daily Planet. We do not hear Perry White say 'Great Caesar's Ghost!', nor did we meet Jimmy Olsen.It was very heartening how we get to meet more of Superman's real and adoptive parents more in this film. We see that Jonathan Kent (Kevin Costner) lived up to 1997, and he did not die from a heart attack. We see Martha Kent (Diane Lane) still alive when Superman begin his career as a hero. We still see Jor-el (Russell Crowe) in many other parts of the film guiding Clark (and Lois!) even as we see him die at the beginning. The relationships of Kal-el/Clark with his fathers and how these shaped him as a hero is a central theme of this film, and I liked that a lot.The whole movie is essentially a remake of 'Superman II', which was generally adjudged to be the best of the Christopher Reeve series. In that film, as with this one, Superman faces General Zod and his minions, who was able to escape his fate in the Phantom Zone and found his way to Earth to create havoc here. General Zod in this film (Michael Shannon) had different motivations for attacking Earth from the first one, which was generally for revenge. Of course, with today's computer generated technology, the special effects were much bigger and better than before. Gone was the simplistic shiny white spiked space pod which brought Kal-El to Earth or the flat rectangular mirror prison of Zod et al. in the Phantom Zone. The fight scenes were so much more explosive, ala Michael Bay style, since both Supes and Zod had matching superpowers crashing through practically all the buildings in the area where they were fighting. Both Smallville and Metropolis were practically demolished to ruins after the big scale martial combat of the Kryptonians. Henry Cavill cut a very dashing figure as the new 'Man of Steel.' His was a brawny, hirsute Clark. His acting style was serious and intense, but never shallow, unlike the last Routh version. Cavill was a fiercer, more macho Superman. I must admit though that it was a little funny how he suddenly became clean-shaven with neat shiny hair once he donned the new Superman costume for the first time. Amy Adams was a strong no-nonsense Lois Lane. Although of course she too had a scene where Superman made her knees weak, but this romance angle was gradually introduced. The dynamics of their relationship was changed quite a bit in this version. There was of course that scene where they fly together, but the situation was totally different and there was no soaring romantic music and poetry reading in the background like the Reeve-Kidder version. I am sure this relationship will be explored more in sequels to come.Overall, this is a very satisfying reboot of the Superman series by Zach Snyder. I liked that they took this one seriously, not devoid of humor but without the slapstick that made previous versions corny. The technical aspects of the film were excellent, especially the rich cinematography, the fast-paced editing, as well as the visual and sound effects of the battle scenes. I looking forward to seeing them reinterpret the evil genius of Lex Luthor in a future installment. This film has a charm distinct enough form the Reeve version and will be a successful franchise of its own.",8,37,76,12 June 2013
21," Math Genius Gone Awry
","It is not so common that we come across a movie about a math genius. Of course, there was 'A Beautiful Mind' and 'Good Will Hunting,' now comes another one. '21' is the story of Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess), an MIT math nerd who wanted to go into Harvard Medical School. However, being poor, he needed to come up with $300,000 for him to get through med school. Opportunity presented itself when his math professor Mickey Rosa (Kevin Spacey) noted his skills and recruited him to join their blackjack card counting group. This group would go to Vegas in the weekends, make a killing at the blackjack tables by employing pre-arranged signals, code words and card counts, and go back to school on Monday as if nothing happened. Of course, you know that with schemes like this, happy days will not be forever.I liked the movie very interesting. I did have to gloss over the fact that I honestly did not understand any of the card counting techniques they were using. What on earth does is mean if the card count is '+17' or '+15'? In any case, I liked the character arc of Ben Campbell and the predicaments he was in. I knewthere would be retribution at the end, and I liked the fact that this part of the movie was not cut and dry. There was still a lot of suspense and unexpected developments.Jim Sturgess, though I have never seen him before, played his role very well, as the shy intellectual turned blackjack high bidder. Kate Bosworth, while gorgeous, looked too old to be his love interest. She did not look like her Lois Lane character here, but she also does not look credible as an MIT rocket science student. Kevin Spacey played his role quite efficiently as always. It was a bit of a stretch to believe how an MIT professor can run this 'business' while having a record in Vegas back in his heyday as a card hustler as well, and still keep using his real name.Overall, I found this very interesting and a movie worth watching. It is even more interesting to find out that this was actually based loosely on a true story!",7,1,2,30 May 2008
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Just Part 1, Yet Excellent Enough on its Own Merits
","The last book in the Harry Potter saga has been split into two parts. At first, maybe people would think it is to squeeze some more financial mileage out of the series. On the other hand, having watched this installment, there is simply too much complex storytelling involved in this book to cram it into only one two and half hour movie.This Part 1 is already a very full two and half hours. The drama begins even before the opening credits roll. The special effects have reached a new high point with the trick of using polyjuice potion to create multiple Harry's. The frenetic escape of Harry in Hagrid's motor sidecar is an achievement in action editing. The trio's penetration of the Ministry of Magic to get the locket horcrux is very exciting and tension-filled.Momentum dips a bit in the midsection as our trio scour the English wilderness for a way to destroy the horcrux. This prolonged section, which some may find boring, dealt more with the personal relationships loyalty of the three friends as challenges are thrown their way. The segment is marked by the hard-to-watch bloodlust of Bellatrix Lestrange and the nobility of Dobby. Watch out too for a most unexpected dance scene which will surely make you smile, if not actually chuckle!In the third section, we learn what the 'deathly hallows' are referred to in the title as our trio learns it from Xenophilius Lovegood. But the main highlight here is a most amazing animated short featurette called 'The Tale of Three Brothers' as narrated by Hermione. This Part 1 ends very well with a sky-splitting final cliffhanger sequence.Its been repeatedly mentioned how the main actors Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson have all grown up in front of our eyes as this movie series unfolded. Rupert and Emma are both taller than Daniel already! Acting-wise, everyone had likewise improved very much. They all even show some skin here. Yes, even Hermione! The support from the esteemed gallery of British actors and actresses serve the film very well indeed. We saw everyone from all the previous films it seems, except for Maggie Smith.The direction of David Yates is excellent as he did in the last two films. Yates and screenwriter Steve Kloves got just the proper mix of action, drama and humor needed to make the saga work on screen. This may just be a set-up installment, however, it stands very strong on its own merits. As the last scene faded to black, the audience will definitely develop the resolve to watch out for the concluding part to be released next summer, and witness the epic Battle of Hogwarts.",9,80,138,18 November 2010
Kung Fu Panda 2," Disappointed: Not as Good as the First
","Just got home from watching the first showing of Kung Fu Panda 4 in local cinema with my kids. We were all very excited about it because we loved the first film very much because of the excellent animation, the snappy dialogues and above all, its heart.However as the movie was starting, for the first few minutes, I was underwhelmed and even bored with the very slow pace of things. The story dealt with Po discovering that he was adopted by his goose father. This is no spoiler because we all obviously know it. We will eventually learn what happened to his parents and how he ended up in a box of radishes outside the noodle shop. From here to there though, the rest of story was very transparent. There was no thrill of discovery for me. The drama seemed forced. I wanted so much to like it, but there was something missing.The voice acting of Jack Black is most distinct and identifiable. He gives Po a most lovable personality. The rest of the voice acting felt generic, such that those big name stars lending their voices were not really necessary. Yes, including Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, Dustin Hoffman. Gary Oldman voices the main antagonist Lord Shen, a misguided peacock. While having a peacock as the vicious enemy was original, it was not executed too well, I felt.On the more positive end, the artwork and animation was definitely still top-notch. The color and computer effects were astounding. The dialogs were similarly snappy. Too bad, the story was not substantial enough to satisfy me. As much as I liked the individual technical aspects, the product as a whole was ultimately unmemorable. The heart of the film was still there though, but by the time you feel it, you may have already been too disappointed to actually appreciate it.",6,6,16,26 May 2011
Hugo," This Movie Never Came Alive For Me!
","By this time I had already watched 6 out of the 9 nominees for Oscar Best Picture announced yesterday. 'Hugo' earned 11 nominations. It has also been named Best Picture of the year by several critics. Martin Scorsese won Best Director in the Golden Globe and other critics awards. When I saw the robot boy in the trailer, I must admit I already had a bad feeling about this film. However, how could all of these awards and critics be wrong? I should have trusted my instincts! Despite all the awards hype and the promise of 'magic' by the trailer, this movie never really came alive for me. From the overlong introduction of the orphan Hugo and his life inside the clockworks of the train station to the Scrooge-like character of Ben Kingsley and the annoying station guard character of Sasha Baron Cohen, I found it all a desperate exercise in tedium disguised by 'beautiful' images and 'special' effects. All this 'beauty' were merely of technical or mechanical nature only. For me, there was nothing really heart-warming or inspirational worth identifying with here.When it came to the climax when the 'fabulous' secret was revealed, it is of a nature that would appeal and mean something only to a very limited segment of the audience. It is not by any degree magical to me, as this whole film would build it up to be. And I would consider myself a film lover! It was simply a very big disappointment because of the big build-up it had and the expectations it came with. I do not really know how a meandering script like this could even be nominated for Best Writing. I do not think Martin Scorsese is really cut out to make films like this one. His first foray into a film for children is not really interesting for children. I do not expect you to take my word for it, but I do not really recommend this film, despite the accolades it carries with it. It is the worst of the 7 Oscar Best Pic-nominated films I have seen.",3,3,14,25 January 2012
Warrior," A sad and brutal masterpiece.
","'Warrior' is about two 'Rocky's in one movie set in the rough world of Mixed Martial Arts. Tommy Reardon (Tom Hardy) is a guilt-ridden war hero who wants to help the widow of a dear friend who died in battle. Brendan Conlon (Joel Edgerton) is a high school physics teacher who is about to be evicted from his house. The movie follows their training and winning matches en route to the inevitable finale at the big-time Sparta Tournament. We also get a peek into their troubled family lives which paints a more dramatic background to the main sports story.I am sucker for movies about brothers. There was 'A River Runs Through It,' 'The Mambo Kings,' 'The Fighter,' and now 'Warrior' is another one. Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton don't really look like brothers, but both look credible in their roles as mixed martial artists. Hardy has that brooding aggressiveness on him. Edgerton has the more underdog role. Nick Nolte shines as the absentee drunkard father who is trying his best to reform, but is still facing rejection. The story takes its time in the beginning, but you will be hooked once the competitions begin. You will definitely want to know who wins in the end and how. The action in this movie is very realistic. Choreography is not evident as everything seems to be happening in actuality. We are brought to ringside seats to see this extremely strenuous sport up close. A sad and brutal masterpiece, you will be moved to tears.",9,0,3,7 January 2012
Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa," Very Funny! (But Obviously Dervative)
","To start with, the first 'Madagascar' was not really an instant favorite of mine. The characters were a tad too shrill and neurotic for me. Over repeated viewings though, it grew tolerable for me. I was not really planning on watching this sequel, but the kids were insistent when we saw it showing in the mall last Sunday, so we watched it.It had the advantage of characters whom viewers have grown familiar with. Somehow they were able to intertwine a rather blatant 'Lion King' storyline with a romantic side story to create this new movie. The feisty little old lady in the train station in the last movie has more than a mere cameo in this installment.I'm guilty to say I actually liked it. It is very funny. I was laughing out loud at certain parts. For all its derivative-ness, the way they tied around together into another cohesive whole was entertaining. Just go watch this for the laughs. The snappy repartee in the dialogue are hilarious! However, there is nothing really original about this. You have heard all its other messages before.",6,2,5,24 November 2008
Salt," Jason Bourne Turns Into a Russian Female
","This is what 'Salt' is all about really. It is essentially Jason Bourne who was transformed into a Russian female. The same super-human double-agent story! The same relentless slam-bang action scenes! The same set-up for a sequel or two! Although the death-defying action scenes in 'Salt' comes across as more difficult to swallow, somehow Angelina Jolie makes it all so believable despite her lean frame. It is really to Ms. Jolie's credit that she is the only credible female action star nowadays. It picks up where she left off in the Lara Croft films, 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith' and more recently, 'Wanted.' She is tough and kick-ass, yet maintaining her cool, collected and sexy aura about her.The intricate plot which is woven around Evelyn Salt, her shadowy origins and her present predicament as she was accused of plotting to kill the Russian president. Like the Bourne films, it is one big chase scene after the other, and many people being killed like flies, while our heroine comes out generally unscathed. Don't think too much and over-analyze the preposterous storyline. Just take it for what it is and enjoy the ride. Incredible yes, but it was very entertaining for me.Good thing, Tom Cruise did not push through with this project, so they turned the lead character into a female and got Angelina Jolie to play her. She gives it that extra spice that gives this movie that something extra to elevate it above the generic action flicks of its kind.",7,3,8,29 July 2010
Disturbia," Thriller Plus Teenage Angst
","The prologue scene before the opening credits really gave me quite a jolt! Turns out that that smashing scene sort of just sets up the personality of the lead character Kale played by Shia LaBeouf. He socks his Spanish teacher one day and gets put under house arrest. I am the type who might even enjoy this type of confinement. But apparently Kale most definitely isn't. He gets very restless on the very first day since his X-Box and Online activities were curtailed. In addition, he gets sassy with his mom, who gets even by cutting off the plug of his TV. Bereft of things to do, he starts looking out his windows, into the lives of his next-door neighbors. He gets very excited with pretty and tone Ashley, who just so happened to just move in with her family. However, the suspense comes in when he notices very strange goings-on with his other neighbor Mr. Turner. Is he involved with a series of missing women? As far as the actors, I see Shia as a young John Cusack, with a sad-sack charm about him. I just have to say that this guy is lucky to be able to romance gorgeous Megan Fox in 'Transformers', and now the beautiful and sexy Sarah Roemer in this movie. I just felt his room was too over-the-top messy. I couldn't be THAT bad! I totally failed to recognize Carrie Anne Moss as Kale's mom! David Morse, on the other hand, is really getting the hang of playing these creepy characters. I certainly have seen him in other movies with characters like Mr. Turner. For the Asian best friend Ronnie, he just had to totally be geeky. What a stereotype! For his credit, actor Aaron Woo did quite well in this obnoxious role.This is teen angst meets 'Rear Window.' There were really scenes that bring you to the edge of your seats. The scene of Mr. Turner and Ashley in the car is classic creepy. Same with the 'Blair Witch'-style camera work when Ronnie breaks into Mr. Turner's garage and house. Exciting! The angst scenes however did not really sit well with me. I think they are way overblown.Just OK with me overall. I would not call it a waste of time. Some tense and exciting suspense scenes that make it worthwhile to catch in theaters.",6,0,0,13 September 2007
Silver Linings Playbook," More Mature Than the Book
","I have recently read the book by Matthew Quick, admittedly in preparation for watching this movie. While the book had a decidedly child-like tone being told in Pat's mentally-disturbed point of view, this movie is a lot more dramatic and serious in tone. The romantic comedy is still in there, but this film is more mature than the book. From the onset, you already knew that this was not going to be an exact depiction of the book. A lot of changes were noted in the transition from book to film. For some reason, the surname of Pat's family was changed from Peoples to Solitano for some reason. The tune Pat hates was changed from the really cheesy 'Songbird' by Kenny G to the less cheesy 'My Cherie Amour' by Stevie Wonder. All the football stories in the book were summarized into one tailgate party scene in the parking lot of the Philadelphia Eagles' stadium.The story progression and development and the climax is totally different from the book but decidedly more effective cinematically. These changes made were in no way insulting or disappointing to the fans of the book. It did lead to an ending we have seen so many times before in several a romantic comedy in a scene not even in the book. But for the sake of the goodwill built up by the very effective chemistry of the two charismatic lead stars, audiences will love it and cheer.It is truly remarkable that a romantic comedy could garner nominations in the top 5 Oscar categories and then some. Aside from Best Picture, Director, Screenplay (adapted), this film had the rare distinction of having a nominee in ALL 4 ACTING categories! While I read the book, I already had Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence in my mind in their respective roles as Pat and Tiffany. While I can fully imagine Cooper as Pat, I simply cannot imagine Jennifer as Tiffany. However, while watching the film, Jennifer could not have been a more apt choice. She pulls off this very mature role convincingly with a ferocity and sexiness heretofore only hinted at in 'X-Men First Class.' Bradley Cooper so far we remember only for his stupid 'Hangover' movies. He gave us a glimpse of his acting versatility in 'Limitless' in 2011. But this role as Pat seemed to have been written with him in mind. He had embodied this role of the troubled bipolar guy to a perfect T. He remains likable despite his condition, as Pat was in the book. As portrayed by Cooper, audiences will root for this guy. While the book had a more dominant role of Pat's Mom, Jacki Weaver had to take a backseat to Robert de Niro in the meatier role of Pat's Dad. Ms. Weaver can count herself lucky to be nominated for the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress as her role had been considerably edited in the final screen version. Glad to see De Niro back in good comic form as Pat's supportive Dad. As originally written, Pat's Dad hardly had any dialog nor much to do. I guess this role was rewritten to deserve the talent of the actor they signed for it. As for its quest to be the first contemporary romantic comedy since 'Annie Hall' (1977) to win best picture, I do not think that is completely impossible. However, win or no, this movie will be a favorite of many audiences, even for guys only forced by their significant others to watch with them. It will make you feel good and smile when you leave the theater, and that is what we all like.",9,2,6,12 January 2013
Divergent," Practically Perfect Interpretation of a Less Than Perfect Book
","Just finished reading the book 'Divergent' before the movie opened today. It was a quick easy read. There was obvious inspiration from various other futuristic young adult books I have read, like 'The Giver', 'Ender's Game' and the 'Hunger Games' books. Like the others, the treatment of the story was cold, But its descriptions of the initiation rites were very much more violent. The setting is the walled city of Chicago after a great war. Their society is divided into five distinct Factions based on personality traits: Dauntless (brave), Amity (friendly), Candor (honest), Erudite (intelligent) and Abnegation (selfless). At the age of 16, a child takes an examination to help him choose which one will be his faction for the rest of his life. He may follow the suggestion of the exam results, or he may decide on his own. Those who fail to be accepted into a faction becomes factionless, as they become hopelessly poor and destitute for life. Our heroine Beatrice Prior has been born to the Abnegation faction with their grey clothes and disdain for any form of vanity. However, her examination results are revealed to be inconclusive, so she has to make her own decision. Meanwhile, an uprising is brewing in Erudite against the government run by Abnegation. I had some problem with the book and the way they try to make the Factions distinct from each other, when it is easy to see that overlapping does happen. These traits simply cannot be mutually exclusive from each other. It is also disturbing the way the author describes the Dauntless. Does being brave mean jumping off running trains, having piercings and tattoos, beating each other up mercilessly, or even killing yourself? This may give immature readers the wrong ideas about courage. <ul><li>o - o - o -</li></ul>The film was a perfectly conceived interpretation of the book. In the first few scenes where they show the color-coded clothes distinguishing each faction was quite clear. How director Neil Burger showed us most of the memorable scenes in the book, like the choosing ceremony, the jumping on and off the trains, the fear landscapes of Tris and Four, and the invasion of Abnegation were all very well done.There were some parts which were reinterpreted in the film. Most did not really affect the story-telling, like changing how Tris meets her Mom during Visiting Day, or glossing over a particularly violent episode where Peter stabs a fellow initiate in the eye. There was one big change towards the end about how a climactic surprise rescue transpired. I thought the version in the book was so much more better set-up and executed than the less-dramatic altered version we saw on screen.As I suspected, the tall and beautiful Shailene Woodley is definitely not the small and mousy Tris we imagine while reading the book. However, I thought Shailene gave an excellent portrayal of Tris' character, how she developed from a shy dependent girl to a confident fearless warrior. For people who have not read the books, they will not be aware of any discrepancy at all. Theo James had very good romantic chemistry with Shailene, so his Four never really felt like a threat to Tris, unlike the initial parts in the book. The director gave James a lot of lingering close-ups for the benefit of the teenage fan girls. Ansel Elgort, who played Tommy Ross in 'Carrie' recently, now plays Tris' brother Caleb. His Caleb is less dynamic than I imagined him in the book. Coincidentally, Elgort has an upcoming movie with Shailene Woodley later this year called 'The Fault in Our Stars' where they play boyfriend-girlfriend.More up and coming actors play other more minor characters. Zoe Kravitz, who was in 'After Earth' last year, is not exactly how I envisioned Tris' best friend, but she won me over as the film went along. Miles Teller, who was recently in 'That Awkward Moment', plays bad boy Peter, whose role in the film is much diminished compared to the book. Jai Courtney, who played Bruce Willis' son in 'A Good Day to Die Hard' last year, brutally plays Tris' tormentor in the training camp. Among the senior stars, Ashley Judd makes a nice comeback of sorts playing Tris' mother, who had major secrets of her own. Maggie Q played Tris' examiner and tattoo artist Tori with the requisite compassion. Kate Winslet plays the cool and calculating Erudite uprising leader Jeanine with icy perfection.Overall, I thought this film was a practically perfect interpretation of a book that was less than perfect in itself. So, whatever things the film might show us which we might not like, like the slow pace of action progression, and the questionable motives of the characters, are actually because the book told it that way. Fans of the 'Divergent' books will find this film version faithful. While it cannot compare to the high standard set by the Hunger Games film series in terms of cinematic quality and character casting, 'Divergent' definitely has its own entertaining appeal going for it. 7/10.",7,12,29,20 March 2014
Ender's Game," Twisted Training
","'Ender's Game' is a science-fiction film about kids being recruited to be soldiers to fight aliens who threaten to destroy humanity. Andrew Wiggin (nicknamed Ender) was the youngest of three siblings, an elder brother Peter who hates him and a sister Valentine who is very devoted to him. Ender was recruited by Coronel Graff when he was observed to have the requisite temperament and leadership potential. He defied all the odds stacked against him by his wits and cunning, and finally being able to successfully destroy his targets in the ultimate simulation test. But he finds out that he has done more than the game he thought he was playing.Lead star Asa Butterfield has grown up taller since his role two years ago in the Oscar-nominated film Hugo under Martin Scorsese. It is impressive that he has these two big films in a row, both with him playing the title role. He is obviously older than the book Ender (by 10 years!), but he was still able to show the vulnerability of this character underneath his military tactical genius. The rest of the cast are an impressive mix of Academy-Award winning or nominated actors. Harrison Ford (nominated for Witness in 1986) energetically plays gruff Coronel Graff. Viola Davis (nominated for The Help in 2011) plays Graff's assistant Maj. Gwen Anderson. Hailee Steinfeld (nominated for True Grit in 2010) plays Ender's training pal Petra. Abigail Breslin (nominated for Little Miss Sunshine in 2006) plays Ender's loving sister Valentine. And finally Ben Kingsley (won for Gandhi in 1982) plays Mazer Rackham, savior of the human race in the second alien attack, who also became Ender's mentor.This film is based on the first novel of what would be a series of five books by Orson Scott Card, aimed for the teenage-young adult crowd. The book contained a lot of psychological analysis of children and violence that underlie the action, which the movie cannot possibly completely convey. The book also had much younger characters than what was shown on screen, like Ender was supposed to have been six years old only. The film nevertheless was a faithful enough adaptation, albeit rushed in parts in the name of cinematic license. It was able to bring to life the action in the training hall and the zero-gravity simulation rooms that would of course rely on the reader's imagination in the book.The film's casting of short and hook-nosed Moises Arias as Bonzo Madrid is also puzzling, since the book describes Ender's tormentor in Battle School to be 'a strikingly beautiful boy of aristocratic Spanish lineage.' Arias is nothing like that physically at all, but the contrast of his Bonzo with Asa's Ender was strikingly ironic.I found it strange that a movie about a devastating alien race never actually shows anything scary about these monsters or what they were supposed to have destroyed on Earth in the past. Instead we see a seemingly gentle and graceful leaf-like insect creature, so as the audience, we are not completely convinced about Ender's mission or Graff's true intentions. So, 'Ender's Game' is good enough as a sci-fi movie with young adult characters in the lead. For me though, the whole film, even with its spectacular special effects, feels strangely generic, and an amalgam of various similar movies in the past. Maybe I am just not its proper target demographic. 6/10.",6,1,2,8 December 2013
The White Ribbon," Unsettling, Unnerving, Unsatisfying
","This is a most widely-praised film, having won the Cannes Palm D'Or and the Golden Globes. I was attracted by its stark black-and-white photography seen in its previews and clips. I had to watch it.This film starts off well enough, feeling like a suspense-mystery, as it relates the strange series of accidents and deaths in a small rural town in pre-WWI Germany. However, as it lumbers on, we get the feeling that this is going absolutely nowhere. It seems to be just a jumble of weird, even evil, events that involved the children of this town. This is definitely unsettling, unnerving and very difficult to watch and follow.It was like a throwback to very old European films. Indeed it did not feel like a contemporary film at all. The acting was wooden. The editing was choppy. Scenes do not seem to lead logically to the next. I would understand leaving the ending open for the audience's interpretation. However, this film had crammed too many inexplicable and unrealistic occurrences that demand a resolution. To be left hanging at the end is quite a distressing disappointment after investing over two hours.",4,10,30,25 January 2010
Monsters vs. Aliens," So-So, If Not For the 3D Effects
","They were already showing trailers of upcoming movies when we came in. I was very surprised to discover that all three of the movies previewed all had 3D trailers! These were 'Coraline', 'Up!' and 'Meatballs'. The studios really have to go the extra mile to ensure people will still be watching in theaters.As for 'Monsters vs. Aliens,' I frankly did not like the movie too much. The Monster characters who are supposed to be the good guys are not too memorable or cute. Even my 7-year old son found the character of Link and Insektosaurus to be 'corny'. The character of Susan/Ginormica is rather 'meh', with a predictable character arc.On the other hand, there were also positives. The main bad guy Alien Gallaxhar, a sinister squid with 4 eyes, was more interesting. The artwork of the alien spaceship interior were also more interesting. The character of the US President was the only thing that is really funny, especially the scene where he makes first contact with the Alien probe, and that stupid scene at the end of the credits.But of course, the best thing about this movie is the 3D. I think I would have dozed off if not for these special 3D effects. But then as the trailers have shown with all these upcoming 3D animated features, this trend may not be something extra special anymore in the future.",4,8,18,6 April 2009
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," Renner and Arterton: Killer Combination!
","I couldn't believe my eyes when I first saw the poster for 'Hansel and Gretel Witch Hunters' because it actually puts together my two favorite current movie stars, Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton! I liked Gothic interpretations of fairy tales like 'Snow White and the Huntsman'. And I also liked the 'supernaturalization' of historical figures like 'Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter' a lot. This film seems to be a cross of those two types, and so is one film I made sure I would watch this once it opened.Hansel and Gretel starts as we all know them from the fairy tale, children left by their parents in the woods. They were lured by a house made of candy, and was captured by the wicked witch who lived inside. We all know how the tale ends, when Hansel and Gretel push the witch into the oven. But that was just the beginning of the movie, for that was when this brother-sister team launch their career as mercenary witch hunters. When a mysterious series of missing children terrorizes a small town, its mayor hires Hansel and Gretel to look for the witches responsible and kill them.That was one shallow story line I know, but I really enjoyed myself while watching this movie. Yes, the gore factor was really high, but everything appeared to be done with tongue strictly in cheek. The actors Renner and Arteron are unquestionable bad-ass! They fit the titular roles very well. You will meet a new, more interesting 'Edward' here. The CG and production design were quite good and imaginative. It was fun to spot traditional witch lore in the scenes, even as they took liberties to invent their own lore.As I mentioned, the film does not shy from bloody violence, as the envelope is pushed to graphically show various mechanisms of death, from crushing to exploding - close-up! There was a brief scene of a nude village beauty Mina (Pihla Viitala) as she seduces Hansel. There were even unexpected modern-day swear words during the witch battles. With all of these scenes, I do not really know how it got a PG-13 rating in this country! Anyway, despite and maybe because of all these surprises, I found the whole film a lot of grown-up fun, a very entertaining one and half hours.After the movie, I found out that the director was Tommy Wirkola, the same guy who directed the Norwegian Nazi zombies in the snow movie 'Dead Snow.' So that is why his strange Tarantino-esque sense of humor is all over this film. I am a fan! I will be awaiting his next project. However, for all the fun I had watching this film though, I think they should be happy with what they have now. I think a H&G sequel would already be pushing their luck.",8,112,191,24 January 2013
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," I Don't Really Think This Movie Had to be Done
","I have read the Steig Larssen book and also saw the 2009 Swedish film 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.' That 2009 movie was already a very good film adaptation of the best-selling novel. That movie also featured an iconic performance by Swedish actress Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth Salander, the titular character. I do not really know why this American version even had to be made, especially during these days of globalization. However, with big names such as director David Fincher and star Daniel Craig attached to this project, and now with its 5 Oscar nominations, I felt compelled to watch this version as well.The story is already well-known. Journalist Mikhael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) was commissioned by industrialist Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer) to solve the mystery behind the 30-year disappearance of his beloved grand-daughter Harriet. Blomkvist sought the help of an unlikely investigator Lisbeth Salander, a strange-looking Goth girl with a shady past herself. Together Blomkvist and Salander unearth the dark and demented secret that had haunted the Vanger family all these years.Granted, this American version had superior technical aspects, most probably because of its bigger production budget. It deserves the nominations it got for its breath-taking cinematography, tight film editing, and excellent sound work. Rooney Mara, whom I first saw in 'The Social Network,' undergoes a total change of look to portray Salander here. It must have been tough for her to create a different Salander performance distinct from that of the already acclaimed Noomi Rapace performance just two years before. Mara's Salander was quieter, more aloof, but more sexually aggressive. I cannot say though that it surpassed or was more memorable than Rapace's Salander.Therefore, if this will be the first film of 'Dragon Tattoo' that you will watch, you are in for a very stylish and exciting ride by David Fincher. However, if you had already seen the Swedish original version, you will really wonder why this version had to be done at all. There was nothing really very wrong with the first film to deserve this immediate remake.",7,0,4,31 January 2012
Dreamgirls," Practically 'The Effie White Story'
","Maybe because of this heightened hype and expectation, the movie turned out to be a disappointment of sorts. I was able to hear the movie soundtrack way before the movie was shown. I was surprised that all the big songs ('And I Am Telling You', 'I Am Changing' and 'One Night Only') are by one singer only, Jennifer Hudson. And she was nominated and won for Bet Supporting Actress! Upon watching the movie, Jennifer Hudson's Effie White is practically the lead character in Dreamgirls in terms of her story arc. She could have won based solely on her powerful 'And I Am Telling You' number.The actual Dreams songs were forgettable and bland, nothing like the classic songs of the Supremes (the supposed inspiration for this musical). When you watch the movie, you will understand that this was indeed the intention of their manager Curtis Taylor, Jr. (underplayed by Jamie Foxx) to have cute pop confections that could cross over to the white audience. In fact, Deena Jones (Beyonce) was chosen as lead singer because of the commonplace quality of her voice, as well as her beauty (showcased to the hilt with close-ups).",6,0,0,18 March 2007
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Crazy Good Cruise Crushes It!
","After four years, Tom Cruise and his crew comes up with yet another episode in the 'Mission:Impossible' film saga. I thought it would be tough to come up with something to top 'M:I Ghost Protocol' (My Review). That 2011 film directed by Brad Bird was simply too awesome, and so far my favorite of the whole series. This new one may have just matched that awesomeness.Ethan Hunt and his IMF team come face to face with the Syndicate, a rogue terrorist operation led by the chillingly ruthless Solomon Lane. Equal to IMF in talent and resources, the Syndicate sends the mysterious female agent Ilsa Faust to obtain highly secure computer files from a highly secure location. The IMF team though gets caught right in the thick of this complex web that again brings them around the world from the US to Cuba, Austria, Morocco and England. Meanwhile, they also grapple with CIA head Alan Hunley who would like nothing but to see IMF dissolved. Tom Cruise is visibly older now, but he can still pull this Ethan Hunt character off so well. He has got his strong action star charisma going on with the bravado he displayed in those death-defying stunts he did reportedly without a double for this film. His crazy plane-hanging stunt that we see in the trailer happens before the opening credits, so do not come in late. His car and motorcycle driving skills were so fantastic in those breathtaking chase scenes. He was said to have had training to hold his breath for up to six minutes to be able to do that long thrilling underwater sequence.As the lead female in the cast, Rebecca Ferguson nailed the role of Ilsa Faust. (Her name was obviously a reference to Ingrid Bergman's character Ilsa Lund in 'Casablanca', a major setting in this film.) She was the one character who had that subtle air of duplicity that makes you doubt whether you'd trust her or not. Her character was the key game changer in the story of this film, and Ms. Ferguson does not disappoint in this pivotal role. She had us on the edge of our seats in those spectacular action scenes of hers, especially that that incredibly vicious knife fight at the end. The ensemble work of the cast behind Cruise and Ferguson was impeccable. Simon Pegg was perfectly droll as tech whiz Benji Dunn. This guy's comic timing was so daft, I loved it. Sean Harris was positively creepy as the villain Lane, so sinister without the excessive hysterics. Jeremy Renner (as Brandt), Ving Rhames (as Stickell), Alec Baldwin (as Hunley) and Simon McBurney (as British agent Attlee) were all on point in their portrayals of spies of various abilities and affiliations. All those complex action sequences were executed faultlessly. The brilliant cinematography, fast-paced editing and the driving musical score (which had elements of the iconic M:I theme mixed with strains from 'Nessun Dorma' from Puccini's 'Turandot') all contributed to the success of these scenes. Among the memorable sequences this film will be remembered for are the opera house assassination attempt scene, the underwater data card-switching scene, the car chase scene through the narrow streets with Cruise driving a 2016 BMW, and the very exciting multiple motorcycle chase scene on a zigzagging road.Perhaps having a new director for every film in this series has kept this franchise from becoming stale. After illustrious names like Brian De Palma, John Woo, J.J. Abrams and Brad Bird at the helm previously, Christopher McQuarrie (who first gained fame as the Oscar-winning writer of 'The Usual Suspects') writes and confidently directs 'M:I Rogue Nation' as excellent cinematic entertainment with just the perfect mix of non-stop action, political intrigue, technological savvy and witty humor. 9/10.",9,7,13,30 July 2015
Shrek Forever After," A More Mature Shrek - A Worthy Last Installment
","Our favorite ogre Shrek is back for its final installment, and this was presented in 3D. 3D is getting to be norm nowadays, it seemed already ordinary. There are only few scenes in this movie that the 3D actually inspired awe. Maybe watching in 2D would be enough, in retrospect.In Shrek Forever After, Shrek is getting bored with his routine family life and misses his terrorizing ogre days terribly. After his emotional breakdown during his triplet's birthday party, Shrek signs a deal with the devious and cunning Rumpelstiltskin to experience to become real ogre again for a day. However, in return, the contract makes Shrek lose more than he bargained for -- everyone he loves. To break the spell, Shrek to make Fiona fall in love with him all over again.The theme is definitely more mature. The scenes where Shrek was trying to reconnect with the warrior Fiona were actually heartwarming and charming. The lines towards the end about love and family were very nice and touching. Shrek's very last words were a most meaningful parting message to the dads and moms in the audience.Donkey and Puss were there to provide effective comic relief, as always. I did not really like the look of the main villain, Rumpelstiltskin, so that detracted from my total enjoyment. I thought their interpretation of the Pied Piper, however, was quite smart.I thought the Shrek franchise went the wrong direction with its insipid third movie. The first two were really animation classics in terms of comedy and action. This fourth one fortunately went back on track in the correct path. While not in the same caliber as the first two, this was certainly a very good last episode of the franchise.",7,3,10,21 May 2010
Bad Teacher," Cameron Diaz Makes This Movie Work!
","I really have to give all the credit to Ms. Cameron Diaz. For her to be playing a crass, bitter, lazy and cruel middle school teacher whose shallow aim for teaching was to get herself a breast implant and snag a rich man to marry, Cameron still manages to make the character absolutely funny, delightful and actually worth rooting for. I really do not know how she does it, but she manages to do so. She has that certain unique indescribable quality that could make such an unpleasant character appear cute.Cameron may be so much older now from her debut in 'The Mask' with Jim Carrey, but she still slinked in that car wash scene like the best of them. Her long legs and lithe body still serve her very well in this scene as if she were just half her present age. I thought her comic timing was on point in most of her scenes. This girl is really very funny! I cannot imagine any other actress who can run with this Elizabeth Halsey and make her likable.Being raunchy and naughty, this certainly is not a movie to watch with your parents. Cameron and her ex-lover Justin Timberlake figure in a most unusual and awkward sex scene. Scenes with cuss words, drug use, and hurting children are in liberal supply here. I generally would not like a movie with scenes like this, but thanks to Cameron Diaz and her inexplicable x-factor charm, I found it really funny and generally had a good time watching it.",6,1,4,1 September 2011
The Amazing Spider-Man," We Can See Why It Should NOT Have Been Rebooted So Soon
","There were so many reasons why I was ready NOT to like this movie. First of all, the original Sam Raimi-Tobey Maguire trilogy was so recent, and were done very well and did so well also box-office-wise. I did not really feel the need to make this reboot at all, much less, too soon after the 'Spider Man 3.' I was also very leery about the choice of Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker/Spider Man. Watching the trailers, I do not know what it was about Garfield's face and body build that did not seem right to be Peter Parker. Anyway, the hype was still really building up, as evidenced by the grand first day showing today in almost 100% of cinemas all over the country. Of course, it was inevitable that my whole family will still go and watch!As it began by telling Peter Parker's high school life, you see that Director Marc Webb was trying so hard to make it different from the first Tobey Maguire movie, and this can be noticed as the movie went along. The story of how Peter was bitten by the super-spider was so far- fetched and unbelievable. The story of how Gwen and Peter became a couple was so rushed. The story of Peter's parents which was what I thought would be a main theme in this movie was hardly tackled in detail at all. Andrew Garfield painted a different Peter Parker than Tobey Maguire. Garfield made the role his own by amp-ing up the angst. I have to grant that Andrew was a better dramatic actor than Tobey. His scenes with veteran actors Martin Sheen and Sally Field (as Uncle Ben and Aunt May) were heartfelt and sincere, as with his romantic scenes with Emma Stone (as Gwen Stacy). However, he seems to become schizophrenic when he dons his Spider Man costume, as he becomes all too cocky for comfort. Emma Stone acted very well as Gwen Stacy. She was a much better love interest than Kirsten Dunst was as MJ in the first movie. I guess it was because Gwen was written to be smart and courageous, unlike MJ who was nothing more than a mere damsel in distress. Rhys Ifans does an effective departure from his usual comedy roles to play the tragic Dr. Curt Connors. It was just too bad that the story of his descent into Lizard madness was too sudden to be affecting or logical. Admittedly, there were so awesome-looking visual effects in this movie. The cartoony multi-color palette of the Tobey version was replaced by a darker and more serious mood in this one, more fitting into the Marvel canons. Overall though, while the effort was there but the final impact of this film could eventually be forgettable. Even the extra scene in the end credits hinting a second installment was predictable. After watching, all my three kids declared that they liked the Tobey version than this. Ultimately, we still remember the Tobey Maguire films too much for this film to take any serious roots into our memory. Let's see if the next installments will make a difference.",6,6,16,29 June 2012
The Lego Movie," Extraordinary Imagination
","'The Lego Movie' is an animated film that uses Lego characters and sets to tell a story of how an ordinary guy can actually be extraordinary.Emmett is just an ordinary construction worker who always waited for instructions to follow, never having an original thought by himself. Falling into a hole one day, he found a mysterious red block, which attached itself to Emmett's back. This turned out to be the legendary 'Piece of Resistance'. This item can only be possessed by a hero called the 'Special' destined to save Lego Land from the nefarious President Business, who threatens everything with 'Kragle'. Threatened, Business sics Bad Cop on Emmett to capture him.Emmett and his friends, the purple-haired Wyldstyle, the old sage Vitruvius and the gruff superhero Batman, escape into Cloud Cuckoo Land to gather up other 'Master Builders'. Who these Master Builders are and how the story goes after this is very complicated to describe in words. It is simply better seen on screen. Just when you think the story is at the limit of its absurdity, a twist happens which grounds everything back to reality.It was fun to hear the voices of Chris Platt, Will Farrell, Elizabeth Banks, Will Arnett, Liam Neeson and Morgan Freeman bring life to the main character. It was fun to see all those cameo appearances of an array of Lego characters from various special Lego sets in the past. Later, it was fun to find out who voiced them (like Channing Tatum, Jonah Hill, Charlie Day or Billy Dee Williams). I felt this was a very imaginative way to tell a relatively common story. The twist at the final act gave it an additional dimension. There is something about Lego that evokes a special kind of nostalgia in older viewers like me. The 3D was also done very well, and was really appropriate for a animated concept like this one. I will not be surprised if this one lands among the Best Animated Feature Films of this year. 8/10.",Null,1,6,11 February 2014
Dallas Buyers Club," Matthew McConaughey Has Arrived
","As a movie star, Matthew McConaughey is more known for his shirtless torso than his talent as an actor. However, in the past two years, he had been taking in roles that have been attracting Oscar talk. The association of McConaughey and Oscar was previously unthinkable. Now this year, he may just finally snag that Oscar nomination, if not the award itself.Set in the 1980s, 'Dallas Buyers Club' is the name of a club whose membership allows patients of AIDS to acquire bootleg medications not yet approved by the FDA. This was established by the most unlikely person, the womanizing, boozing, homophobic, rodeo-loving, redneck drug- addict Ron Woodroof (McConaughey). When AZT was not working well for him, Woodroof sought out a maverick doctor in Mexico supplying these experimental drugs, and smuggled them back to the States. Together with Rayon (Jared Leto), a flamboyant transsexual also with HIV, as his unlikely business partner, Woodroof fought the establishment on behalf of AIDS victims and their access to medications.Jared Leto was unrecognizable both physically and behaviorally as Rayon. This lead singer of the rock band 30 Seconds to Mars had completely transformed into a different person. Leto was very active in films from the late 1990s to the early 2000s. He was in notable films like 'Requiem of a Dream' and 'Fight Club.' His last memorable role was in the infamous 'Alexander' in 2004, which sort of presages this present role of his. He has come back to film a big way this year in this darkly comic role, and may even be up for an Oscar nomination of his own as Supporting Actor.Matthew Mc Conaughey had been stereotyped into shallow rom-coms throughout the 2000s in films like 'The Wedding Planner,' 'Failure to Launch,' and 'Ghosts of Girlfriends Past.' The awards buzz started in 2012 with his roles in 'Bernie,' 'Killer Joe,' 'The Paperboy,' and especially 'Magic Mike' all flirting with Oscar talk. Early this year, he continued his streak with 'Mud' and finally this one in 'Dallas Buyers Club.' His physical transformation from his well-known buff surfer body to that of an emaciated AIDS patient was impressive, but more importantly it was his total commitment to the complicated role that may finally give him the big prize.The film itself is well-made by director Jean Marc Vallee, with disturbing images of Woodroof's raunchy lifestyle contrasting with his crusading work later in life. But this film is really all about Matthew McConaughey and his growth as an actor. His performance as Ron Woodroof is the main attraction of this film.",7,0,3,6 January 2014
Now You See Me," A Fun Magical Ride That Will Keep You Thinking
","This opened as a very low key movie release locally. However, I kept reading praises about it from social media, I resolved to give it a try and see for myself. I had a lot of fun watching, and I believe, so will you.The fascinating premise of the film begins even before the opening credits. We meet four talented magicians who had been summoned by a mysterious hooded stranger who left them each a invitation card marked by an eye design at the backs. A year later, they were the toast of Vegas, calling themselves the Four Horsemen, staging big elaborate magic shows. One performance, they picked a Frenchman 'randomly' from the audience to create the illusion that he had robbed a bank in Paris. Police and Interpol get involved when money really disappeared from that bank! That incredibly staged heist is only the beginning of a puzzling roller coaster ride of a film that will keep you wondering to the very end. Director Louis Leterrier (whose debut was 'Transporter' in 2002) has executed a very energetic, intelligent and most importantly, entertaining film. The actors were all so eager, smart and funny in their roles. Jesse Eisenberg is believable as a control freak street illusionist. Woody Harrelson was a down-on-his-luck mentalist is outstandingly hilarious. Isla Fisher has gone a long way from her awkward debut in that Scooby Doo film. Just when you thought Dave Franco is just a minor player, he will surprise us with an exciting fight scene and car chase. And on the other side, Mark Ruffalo is just so right as the harassed police officer who always seemed to be two steps behind the magicians. Veterans Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman add their cool credibility to the mix, as they always do to any film they are associated with.While it is a pity that we do not get to meet the four magicians more in depth, and some of the illusions and action stunts were too impossible (and too CG), I think we can overlook and forgive those little quibbles. Do not think too hard and over-analyze about the twists and turns this film takes you on (especially in the final minutes), just sit back and enjoy the fun ride while it lasts. It is, after all, all about magic.",8,4,12,4 June 2013
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Starting All Over Again
","Powerful Sentinels from Trask Industries were decimating all the mutants, leaving only a handful of the hardiest ones alive. Logan is sent back twenty years into the past during the inception of the Sentinel program, to stop this project before it destroys the mutant race anymore.Young Charles Xavier was up and about but without his powers. Young Eric was incarcerated in a subterranean cell within the Pentagon because on his implication in the JFK assassination. Young Raven/Mystique was intent to kill Trask himself before he kills more mutants. Logan must make them all see how their actions now will impact on the very existence of mutants on Earth in the future.Because this is already the fifth X-Men film, we know each mutant individually and are invested in their collective mythology. This installment gives us further details into the past of each of the main mutants and we see how each one evolves into how we know them in the present time.The visual effects are expectedly awesome. My favorite scene would be the sequence where Charles and Logan attempt to break Eric out if his prison with the help of the super- speed powers of Peter/Quicksilver. The stop-motion, sense of humor and the song 'Time in a Bottle' in the background makes it very memorable. The other epic sequence was that when an entire sports arena was lifted from its foundations and used to corral the White House itself.The actors we know and loved from all the previous films: Hugh Jackman (as Logan/Wolverine), Patrick Stewart and James McAvoy (as Charles Xavier, old and young), Ian McKellen and Michael Fassbender (as Eric/Magneto, old and young), Jennifer Lawrence (as Raven/Mystique) -- all do excellently in their respective characters. Nicholas Hoult reprises his role as young Hank McCoy/Beast. There will be shorter and shocking appearances by Halle Berry and Anna Paquin as Storm and Rogue, respectively. Towards the end, there will be surprising cameos by Mutants who had taken already their leave in previous episodesFor the new cast members, Evan Peters shines in his outstanding performance as Quicksilver, a character who was both quick in action and in wit. Ellen Page appears as Kitty Foyle, whose power made it possible for Logan to travel back in time. Newly-featured mutants Bishop (Omar Sy) and Blink (Bingbing Fan) get prominent action sequences in the climactic battle sequence.I thought it was an inspired idea to cast Peter Dinklage as the genius scientist Trask. He brings his 'Games of Thrones' acting intensity into this film in this dark character. It was also interesting to see how Stryker got his sinister character into the X-Men canons. Josh Helman portrays him with the necessary antagonistic swagger.As with the other Marvel films, do wait up for a breathtaking short extra clip of a robed figure in and the Pyramids. This bonus scene teasing the next X-Men film Apocalypse (2016) is seen only after all the credits roll up.This film had so many characters (even former US President Nixon plays a key part) and so many events shuttling from present to past and back. Despite all the potential plot holes a time-travel storyline can present, Director Bryan Singer still manages to tell his story in one cohesive whole. This is yet another excellent proof that the X-Men film franchise is indeed the best among the Marvel collection. 9/10.",9,3,8,21 May 2014
Quantum of Solace," Fantastic Action Scenes! But there seems to be something missing?
","'Quantum of Solace' has all the trappings of a typical James Bond film. This is a very exciting action film. It is action-packed from the very beginning. It starts with a very rough car chase. How the Aston Martin can still move smoothly after all of those heavy hits and how James gets through practically unscathed is the stuff of Bond legend.The film explodes a basic revenge plot into overwhelming proportions. It also brings us from one exotic location to another as Bond follows Dominic Green of the Green Planet company for some issue involving the Casino Royale Bond girl Vesper Lind. Action takes us from Siena, Italy to London, to Haiti, to Austria, back to Italy, then off to Bolivia, then finally to Russia.There were chases and encounters on foot, and involving all forms of transportation, by land, by water, and by air! The editing of the scenes during the staging of 'Tosca' in Austria, and the fiery explosions in the Perlas de las Dunas in Bolivia are definitely award-worthy. The parkour scenes were reminiscent of 'Casino Royale,' however it was topped by the amazing fight scene on the scaffolding with all the falling glass shards.Overall, it was a good action movie. 'Casino Royale' was better though, in my opinion. Rough-hewn Daniel Craig was really very cool in his demeanor and stance. His Bond is practically superhuman, yet still realistic (in some inexplicable contradiction of adjectives). Olga Kurylenko as Camille, the Bond girl, does not immediately strike as a typical beauty, though she did grow on me as the movie progressed. I guess there is a little bit something lacking amidst all that fantastic action, and I think it may have been the weakness of the storyline.",7,3,4,12 November 2008
No Country for Old Men," Overrated and Disoganized Disappointment
","I watched this movie because it was the pick to win the Oscar for Best Picture this year. I don't get it. I did not like it. It was very long and episodic. While there well-shot individual scenes, yet with no coherence in its totality. It seemed to be about this guy Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) who stumbled into a bag containing two million dollars, and how this money turns his life topsy-turvy (I know, we've seen that before). But somewhere down the line, it lost me as to what it was really all about.The violence is too brash and in-your-face, yet numbing and gratuitous. These scenes are largely due to one man, Anton, played by Javier Bardem, who really very creepy in his crazed killer role. He went to town with it, and is considered a lock for the Best Supporting Actor prize. While I was very distracted with his weird hairstyle, he was successful in developing tension in every scene he was in. He was especially effective in the quiet scenes like that with the gas station owner, the wife of Moss, and even that with a miscast Woody Harrelson. The question always comes up in your head--will he shoot them or not?The Texas accents are too thick for me to understand the dialogues clearly, and that further reduced my full understanding. That entire mumbling monologue of Tommy Lee Jones at the end was such a major anti-climactic let-down for me.I liked the Coen brothers' work with 'Fargo,' that actually succeeds despite its unusual premise. But this one is very disorganized in its direction. This was exemplified was that strange decision was having a main character die off-camera. Why? It felt like you just wasted your time following his actions and decisions, just to have his character snuffed out so suddenly and anonymously.In general, I was very disappointed with this one. Maybe too much high expectations led to my reduced appreciation. Definitely, this was not how I felt after watching 'The Departed' the other year. I knew right away that film was a winner. This one, I don't think I would even have the patience to watch again.",4,3,6,1 February 2008
District 9," An Expanded Indie Sci Fi Film
","When I first saw the trailer, I did not think I will like this movie. Ugly mechanical-looking aliens coexisting with humans did not really appeal to me that much. When I saw the name of Peter Jackson (of 'Lord of the Rings' fame) above the title in the poster, then I got interested. However, as the credits came up at the end of the movie, I discovered that Peter Jackson did not actually direct this film, but is just one of the producers. I guess they had to highlight Jackson's name since the director and actors in this project are all unknown.The whole film for me felt like an extended independent film with a budget for CG special effects. The aliens (derogatorily called 'prawns') were housed in a slum township in Johannesburg called District 9. The aliens here are left to fend for themselves among greedy and deceitful humans. They lead bleak and violent lives, scavenging for food in garbage dumps and victimized by abusive human gangs. (How is that for a social allegory?) After 20 years of such tension-filled co-habitation, humans decided to move the aliens 200 km away from the city. And this is where the main story begins.I liked the documentary feel of the whole movie. The scenes were taken from the lenses of a television cameras, hand-held cameras or even security cameras. I liked the fact that there were no name actors in this film. In fact, the lead role was amazingly played by a first-time film actor named Sharlto Copley. His ordeal as Wikus van de Merwe, from the over-eager officer in charge of evicting the aliens from District 9 to his exposure and infection with an alien fluid was very well-portrayed. His performance was very natural, as if he was ad-libbing the whole time . This also added to the indie film feel of the film.Because of the indie film vibe of this film, I am ready to just overlook the obvious plot holes. The main holes dealt with the nature of the Prawns themselves. Why have they arrived all those years ago? Why have a seemingly advanced alien life form allow themselves to turn into savages? Why was the effort to return to the mother ship only undertaken by a single alien entity named Christopher (and his son)? And what is the exact nature of that mysterious alien fluid? Unfortunately, the film expects us to just accept these things as a given and gives us no explanations. Ignore them as I would, these glaring unanswered questions detract from the overall quality of the whole movie.",7,2,5,1 September 2009
Mamma Mia!," A Very Summer-y Musical
","What can I say about this movie? I grew up on that ABBA music and I really enjoyed watching these songs actually fit into the situations in the lives of single mom Donna (veteran Meryl Streep) and her daughter Sophie (a very charming Amanda Seyfried), who live in their own villa-inn on a Greek island.Sophie is now 20 years old and getting married to a guy named Sky. She never knew who her real father was. A few days before the wedding, she was able to get hold of her mom's old diary and got three names of possible candidates. How she was able to find the current addresses of an American architect Sam (a very enthusiastic Pierce Brosnan), a British banker Harry (a typical Colin Firth) and a Swedish writer Bill (a bit out of place Stellan Skarsgard), we will never know. But she was able to send invitations to them, and they all accept! As I said, I was amazed how the Abba songs seem to fit right into specific situations. Like when Donna's best friends Tanya (Christine Baransky) and Rosie (Julie Walters) try to get a crying Donna to open up with 'Chiquitita', as in 'Chiquitita tell me what's wrong...') Later, they try to cheer her up with a rousing version of 'Dancing Queen' that gets all the womenfolk on the island dancing.Another part which made you feel as if the music was written for the story was 'Slipping Through My Fingers', sung by Donna when she was bonding with Sophie for the last time before her wedding ceremony. This part was so beautifully touching (and yes, tear-jerking). I have not yet heard this song before, but I think I could sing this song at my own daughter's wedding.The next song was the hit 'The Winner Takes It All.' Sam wanted to talk to Donna before Sophie's wedding, but Donna replies, 'I don't wanna talk about things we've gone through...' Slipped in like a Cinderella's glass slipper, PERFECT! And Meryl Streep's singing was show-stopping. Vocally not perfect, but it was raw and convincing -- a bravura performance! Everyone had a highlight. My favorite Pierce Brosnan song was 'S.O.S.' His rather gruff voice sounded quite unusual singing, but he kept on key. Julie Walters had her solo moment towards the end with 'Take A Chance On Me', when she was trying to seduce Bill who was reluctant to give up his bachelorhood (imagine the scene ...'If you change your mind, I'm the first in line...take a chance on me' -- so appropriate!).The story is simple, but engaging with surprises at the end. The look of the film may appear very rough around the edges due to the set design, make up and photography, but this was really like how Donna and Sophie lived their lives on that island. Cinematography was great looking with the breathtaking Greek scenery, but for some reason, it was very unflattering to the senior stars, including Ms. Streep and Mr. Brosnan. Ms. Streep's costumes do not really look very good on her.But in general, it was very enjoyable and fun to watch. It was really the music that people loved, and the very capable cast more than succeeds to bring these beloved ABBA songs to life!",8,2,3,17 July 2008
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," How to Fight a Dragon
","I'm glad I was able to watch the first Hobbit film before watching this film. This film did not really go into much detail in explaining who the characters were and what they were up to for those who missed the first film. Though you may eventually pick the story up if you were very attentive, those with less concentration may get lost. Desolation of Smaug picks up from the first film where our hobbit Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) and the 13 Dwarfs led by Thorin (Richard Armitage) continue on their way to the Lonely Mountain to reclaim the lost Dwarf kingdom of Erebor, as Gandalf (Ian Mc Kellen) went looking for the Necromancer in Dor Guldur. Along the way, they encounter deadly Orcs, Giant Spiders and Elves who throw wrenches into their quest. With the help of Bard, a human from Laketown, they reach their destination and encounter Smaug, the fire-breathing dragon that had taken over the Dwarfs' old realm.Again like the first film, there are several memorable action sequences that make this a film to enjoy and remember. That scene with the vicious Giant Spiders will chill your spine. Then there was that entertaining and breathtaking sequence where the Dwarfs were escaping on wooden barrels down a river while being attacked by Orcs, then the elegant Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and she-elf Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly) come to their aid with their awesome bow and arrow skills.Most of all though, this film will be most remembered for Smaug himself. The special visual effect was very convincing that this was a living breathing beast. Its voice, lent by the versatile Mr. Benjamin Cumberbatch, is tauntingly sinister and evil. That entire last hour with Smaug as the Dwarfs were doing all they can within their ingenuity and ability to kill him was worth the price of admission in itself. The story telling of Peter Jackson dragged or stretched on a lot of occasions during the film, but you will eventually get your bearings straight when the next scene comes on. Editing could have been more judicious. A romance angle was introduced by Jackson where there was none in the book, which though not really necessary, was not distracting at all from the main story. The cinematography was as usual top-notch all throughout, though the CGI was overwhelming. The production design was hiked up another full level from the first film with such spectacular sets as the Elves lair and dungeons, the Lake town and the lost glory that was Erebor. The sound and the music were all very effective in establishing mood and atmosphere.",8,5,11,14 December 2013
The Fault in Our Stars," Young Love in Numbered Days
","I read the book by John Green in one morning. It was a quick read, but it was uncomfortable to read in its sadness. This novel was about the love story between two cancer-stricken teenagers. I am surprised it was a bestseller given the book's topic seemed so morose and upsetting for the young adults that it targets. While it had its effective moments, the book had a language that tended to be rather indulgent and unrealistic given the age of its teen protagonists.The film is a very faithful adaptation of its source novel. It is so faithful that the faults of the book also become its faults. The film is two hours and ten minutes long. It felt too long, sometimes wallowing too much in its own misery. Luckily, the dialog in the film's script were more believably teenage. I enjoyed the delightful animation used to show us the text messages between the two lovers. The wonderful soundtrack consisted of cool songs by Ed Sheeran and several other indie-type musicians. This type of music highly complemented the film's youthful angst.Also, the film benefits from the earnest performances from its main cast. Shailene Woodley has a malleable face, not too perfectly pretty or distinct, just right for portraying a wide array of characters. She was really very effective as Hazel Grace, given that this was such a difficult part to play, demanding both physically and emotionally. Ansel Elgort had the charisma required to play her ideal boyfriend, Augustus. The unbelievable perfection of his character as written becomes his limitation as actor. Ironically, for me the best parts of the book did not materialize that well on screen. These were their Dutch-motif picnic in the park and their heart-to-heart talk about the new PET scan result. The way Ansel Elgort delivered his lines in these two important scenes were not clear enough to create the welling dramatic impact they did in the book. The script did not even include that highly-emotional moment towards the end when there was dead silence after a recording of a beloved voice invited to leave a voice mail.Overall, I think this film is good to watch depending on your mood. It can give you a good cry if you let it, though I thought the book might be more effective a tearjerker than the film. The best thing about this film is seeing Woodley and Elgort together as Hazel and Gus. The both of them had captured so well the essential chemistry of these two star- crossed lovers as described in the book, and this saves the film from being too depressing.",7,3,7,5 June 2014
Twilight," Not bad, but compromised by very high expectations
","I have read the book. And today I watched the movie. So what do I think? They got the atmosphere of rainy and gloomy Forks, Washington right. They got the actors right, most of the time. My personal favorite actor was the guy who played Bella's dad Charlie, because he was so natural in his strained interactions with Bella. But I will complain about the ghastly overly white make-up for the vampires being too obviously make-up (especially for Dr. Carlisle Cullen).As the leads, Kirsten Stewart (as Bella) and Robert Pattinson (as Edward) have a lot of big expectations to live up too. They have got the right look, but I think the exquisite descriptions in the book made their job very difficult to pull off for the big screen. The readers have made their imaginations run wild with the vivid narrations of Ms. Meyer in her novel, so it would be difficult to satisfy everyone's own interpretation. Their interpretations may never be enough for true Twilight fans.Poor Robert Pattinson certainly has more pressure since Edward is a veritable demigod in the novel The fans have their own individual ideas on how Edward should look, talk, run, fight, glisten in the sunlight, etc. I personally felt he was too stiff in his interpretation of Edward. This maybe more of a problem with the director's vision though, rather than the actor's call. There were very awkwardly filmed scenes, like their first class together, and their first kiss.My wife watched this without reading the book yet and she generally likes it as a romance movie. It was enough to make her overlook the vampire aspect which she does not really relish. I personally felt more time could have been spent to establish the depth of their love for each other. The director chose to spend more time to establish the presence of James' group, where Laurent was unexpectedly played by a black actor. In fact, this film really takes an effort to create a multiracial casting, for which it can be commended.It is not a bad movie. It is just compromised by too much high expectations from readers of the novel who have eagerly anticipated this film treatment.",6,2,6,27 November 2008
Wreck-It Ralph," 'Monsters Inc.' Set In a Video Game World
","I did not really plan to watch 'Wreck It Ralph' at all because I do not really like the recent Disney output. I am unfamiliar with the characters and the title and poster did not look attractive to me. However, with consistently good word-of-mouth reviews, I felt I had to give it a shot. And yes, 'Wreck It Ralph' deserves its good reputation, and I am glad I got to see it.'Wreck It Ralph' is the brutish gorilla-of-a-man villain of a arcade video game called 'Fix It Felix'. After thirty years of being thrown off the side of the building, Ralph feels he wanted to be the hero for a change. So he ventures outside his game to neighboring combat game 'Hero's Duty' to earn his very own medal (as he sees Felix get a medal after each game). When he does get his medal, Ralph accidentally triggers a virus which attacks him and brings him into the Technicolor world of the racing game 'Sugar Rush'. There he meets the cute little glitch Vanellope who earnestly wants to join and win a race, but is not allowed to because of her imperfections. Can Ralph help Vanellope achieve her dream, save his video arcade world from viral destruction and be a real hero?While everything in 'Wreck It Ralph' seemed new and original, I could not help but feel the spirit of 'Monsters Inc.' all throughout the film. It had the same basic story of a lonely but despised 'bad' guy who does good and becomes a hero for a change. Even the interconnected world behind the video arcade (where all the characters had a life after the arcade closes for the night) is reminiscent of the labyrinthine world behind the closet doors in 'Monsters Inc.' Overall though, 'Wreck It Ralph' remains to be fun and happy, with just the right dose of drama and action here and there to entertain viewers of all ages. The artwork of the characters and the settings is very colorful and visually arresting. This is definitely a contender for best animated feature film of the year.",7,5,5,17 December 2012
To Rome With Love," A Very Disappointing Buffet of Nothing Much
","After the critical and commercial successes of 'Vicky Cristina Barcelona' and 'Midnight in Paris,' Woody Allen follows these city- tributes up with another one, this time for the Italian capital of Rome. In my opinion though, unlike the previous two films mentioned, 'To Rome with Love' had honestly nothing to love about it.The whole film is a string of four different strange stories with apparently nothing to do with each other. Jack (Jesse Eisenberg) is an American student living in Rome with his fiancée. When his fiancée's best friend Monica (Ellen Page) comes to visit, Jack gets attracted to her. His friend John (Alec Baldwin) advises Jack accordingly. While Eisenberg and Page have great chemistry together, the seemingly imaginary nature of Baldwin's character makes this episode strange.Leopoldo (Roberto Benigni)is a man who suddenly becomes an overnight celebrity for no apparent reason. This story is downright senseless and lame-brained. I cannot imagine how Woody finds this story funny in any way. Benigni seemed to just being himself, stupidly.Antonio and Milly are a newly wed couple from a small town who are in Rome to meet some relatives. Milly loses her way when she was looking for a hairdresser and gets caught up in a tryst with movie 'sex symbol' Luca Salta. Meanwhile, Antonio was hooking up with prostitute Anna who entered their hotel room by mistake. This episode was also pretty annoying as well as silly, with only the luminous Penelope Cruz, who played Anna, as the saving grace.Woody Allen himself returns in front of the camera as Jerry a music producer who visits Italy to meet his daughter's fiancé and his family. He was so taken by the great operatic voice of Giancarlo, the fiancé's father played by real-life tenor Fabio Armiliato, that Jerry wants to promote him. But alas, it turns out Giancarlo can only sing well when he is in the shower! Again this becomes another disappointingly preposterous episode.Ultimately, you will feel like this film is an absolute waste of time. You do not get anything out of it, not even a good feeling. This is a big disappointing letdown from Mr. Allen especially as he is coming off a series of film successes. 'To Rome with Love' will definitely NOT be one of those successes.",4,4,9,9 December 2012
Bridesmaids," Drama Parts Actually Outshine the Funny Parts in this Comedy
","I am not really used to watching a comedy where all the main actors were women. This is especially if the comedy is Rated R, raunchy, and vulgar which we are more used to seeing with male actors. I do not even know any of the cast members in this movie very well. I just watched this because of its reputation as a sleeper comedy hit in the US. In a very short summary, 'Bridesmaids' could roughly be compared to a female version of 'The Hangover' as all the character's misadventures lead up to a climactic wedding at the end. Basically it is about Annie (Kristen Wiig) whose best friend since childhood Lilian (Maya Rudolph) is about to get married. However, with all the unfortunate things (lost business, bad boyfriend, bad housemates) that were happening in Annie's life at that moment, even her friendship with Lilian was being strained by the pushiness of Lilian's new friend Helen (Rose Byrne) in one-upping Annie in the preparation for the wedding.The funniest scene for me was when Annie was trying her darnedest to catch the attention of a cop to get him to help her look for Lilian. This scene really made Wiig shine in her physical comedy, really hilarious. Too bad though that lot of the other gags were quite awkward and uncomfortable to watch, especially the one in the bridal shop, that one of the plane to Vegas, or anything with Annie's jerk of a sex partner. Unfortunately these rather unfunny scenes took a very prolonged time. Ironically for a movie that was supposed to be a raunchy comedy, the dramatic scenes were actually quite good. You can see in my summary of the story line that there is actually a very real conflict here that can try friendships. Everything after the funny scene I described above leading up to the charming ending was very good. I also sort of liked the surprise guest appearance during the wedding, a very nice touch.",5,1,3,21 July 2011
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Exists Just to Get Us Ready for Part II
","I did not watch this film when it was first shown last year. Honestly, the Hobbits were not exactly my favorite among the characters of the original Lord of the Rings trilogy of films. So why was I going to watch a long three-hour movie all about a Hobbit?! However, now that there is buzz about the second film being shown in cinemas this week, I have decided to watch this first film finally in order to watch its well-reviewed sequel.It turns out 'The Hobbit' is about only ONE Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins. Aside from the Grey Wizard Gandalf, the rest of the characters going on the titular 'Unexpected Journey' are actually Dwarfs. The journey was made to help the Dwarf warrior Thorin recover the lost Dwarf Kingdom from under the control of the dragon Smaug (that is the name in the sequel's title). On this journey, they will encounter Goblins and Orcs who will imperil them in various spectacular elaborately-executed, yet obviously computer generated battles scenarios. Every member of the quest group seemed to have charmed lives the way they escape even the most precarious and deadly situations. These action scenes were fun to watch in their video-game-like presentations, though they went on a tad too long.There will also be quiet scenes, and these were actually more effective. Gandalf will have an audience of Lady Galadriel in Riverdell. And in the best part of the film, Bilbo will encounter Gollum, and we will witness how the Hobbit gains possession of Gollum's 'preciousssss' Ring. This was THE big moment of the whole film though it only comes after the second hour already, when you may already be zoned off since nothing of any big significance happened before this iconic scene.This first film really just prepared us for this second film when they will actually encounter Smaug. OK, now I am ready to watch Part II.",7,0,2,12 December 2013
Before Sunset," The Riveting Conversation Goes On and Grows Up
","I just finished watching 'Before Sunrise' and I am glad I do not have to wait nine years to find out what happened to the love story of Celine and Jesse in 'Before Sunset'.Jesse is now a successful author after he wrote a novel about his very special encounter with Celine we all watched in 'Before Sunrise.' He was doing a book tour in Europe and the last stop happened to be Paris. It just so happened that the book signing was a bookshop which was also Celine's favorite. Of course they meet, and then went around Paris the rest of the afternoon until Jesse's plane will be leaving at sunset. As with the first film, we see them talking about how their lives went since that fateful day in Vienna years back. Julie Delpy (as Celine) did not age too much, but Ethan Hawke (as Jesse) looked significantly older. But the years did not diminish their chemistry with each other. The script by Richard Linklater this time was shorter, more sober, with deeper issues and mature emotion now, compared to the first one which was generally lighter, whimsical, with palpable youthful vibrancy. The transition over the years was perfectly reflected in the words they spoke. Again, we are drawn into their conversation, until that open and puzzling final scene.OK that is it. I will definitely go watch 'Before Midnight' when it opens in local theaters next week.",7,0,0,8 July 2013
Non-Stop," Ticking Time Bomb on a Plane
","Beginning with 'Taken' in 2008, Liam Neeson has really been going to town with his yearly action films which really hit the spot among movie fans. There had been no more projects of 'Schindler's List' level, but his latest movies had been more shallow fun and excitement for the audiences to enjoy than for the critics. With the title alone, this latest film of his, 'Non-Stop' follows that same successful trend.This action-thriller is set in the claustrophobic confines of a passenger airplane in a trans-Atlantic flight. Bill Marks is a US Marshall. Mid-flight he begins to receive text messages in a secure line, demanding that he should get $150M deposited in a certain bank account, or else a passenger will be killed every twenty minutes until the demand is met. Because of Marks' gruff demeanor and rough ways, everyone thinks he is the hijacker! This inaccurate impression of Marks is likewise spreading beyond the confines of the plane in the news media. But Marks still had to keep his wits about him as he tries to figures out who among his co- passengers is the real culprit as the timer of a ticking time bomb is quickly running out.Liam Neeson really has flawed hero characters like Bill Marks down pat. He has the dramatic skills and the action skills to pull this off creditably and believably. This guy is really on a roll. He is incredibly busy for an actor his age (he turns 62 this year), having six more films in the works for this year and the next, including 'Taken 3'.Playing his gallery of suspects among the passengers are Julianne Moore (a lady who wanted to take the window seat beside Marks), Nate Parker (a military guy), Scoot McNairy (a school teacher), Corey Stoll (a NYC cop), Omar Metwally (a Muslim neuro-scientist). The two stewardesses were played by Michelle Dockery and surprisingly, Lupita Nyong'o (who just won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for '12 Years a Slave'). You may need to suspend disbelief and not think too hard about the events as they transpire. You are bound to find a plot hole or two if you look too hard. Some behaviors of the passengers, and even of Marks himself, felt very unrealistic, given the situation. Actually, hearing the entire motivation behind the whole complex plot verbalized may be a downer for some people. Overall though, the situation presented was very exciting. The suspense kept you at the edge of your seats. That is the most important in a film like this, and 'Non-Stop' achieves just that. 7/10.",7,1,5,4 March 2014
How to Train Your Dragon 2," An Exhilarating and Emotional Roller-Coaster Ride
","How To Train Your Dragon 1 is one of the most delightful surprises I had in cinema. I went in expecting to hate the film because of its 'unattractive' human and dragon animation. However, as the film unfolded, this story of how a boy Hiccup and his new pet dragon Toothless totally changed the history of human-dragon relationships turned out to be outstanding and endearing. Catching this sequel is a no-brainer. We all wanted to see the next chapter in the lives of the two inseparable friends.Part 2 happens five years after the events of the first installment. Hiccup is now a young man of 20, already being primed by his father to be the new chief of their village Berk. However, Hiccup discovers a plot of a scarred renegade named Drago to form a dragon army to control the world. While his father Stoick prepares for war, Hiccup decides to seek Drago out in order to settle the matter peacefully. In his quest though, Hiccup chances upon the secret icy lair of the legendary Dragon Rider, who turns out to be Hiccup's long-lost mother Valka.The artwork is so much more improved than the first one. The play of the artists on texture is impeccable. The leathery black skin of Toothless, the stubble on Hiccup's chin, the thick hair and beard of Stoick, each idiosyncratic little feature of each of the countless dragons, the flames, the ice, the oceans -- the artists have outdone themselves. The acrobatic flying sequences and battle scenes are very imaginatively executed. The way the artist make us feel the wind currents as the dragons are in flight was unbelievable. The musical score by John Powell is very effective in evoking both the exhilaration of the action scenes, as well as the drama of the intimate scenes.The voice acting of the actors behind each of the lead characters add so much to their personalities. Jay Barruchel's voice perfectly captures Hiccup as a fun-loving, earnest but lost young man, uncertain of where his future really lies. Cate Blanchett's characteristically cool voice lends a lot of credibility to Valka, torn between her commitment to her dragons and to her reunited human family. Gerald Butler's commanding voice as Stoick as warrior can convincingly turn loving and gentle as the situation warrants. Butler will also surprise us again with his singing voice, which we have missed since his stint as the Phantom of the Opera years back.Writer and director Dean DeBlois successfully tells us a story that is mature with a generally dark mood, with very serious themes of family, loyalty, selflessness and heroism. There will be tears, so get ready for that. For the very young kids, count on Dreamworks to spice things up with some comic moments with foolish kiddie pranks and cute dragon babies though. Overall this is one big emotional roller-coaster ride -- so fun and entertaining, yet complete with important lessons in life for all ages. 9/10.",9,2,7,9 June 2014
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Charming Delightful
","'The Grand Budapest Hotel' is the latest quirky masterpiece of young acclaimed writer-director Wes Anderson. Since his breakthrough writing and directing 'Rushmore' in 1998, his every output had been highly anticipated, admired and discussed. 'The Royal Tenenbaums' (2001), 'the Fantastic Mr. Fox' (2010) and 'Moonrise Kingdom' (2013) have all been nominated for Oscar honors. His films are all marked with wry humor and out-of-the-box imagery, making them delightful and memorable.His latest film 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' brings us to quaint and exotic Eastern Europe in the 1930s. The hotel was in its heyday as the hangout of the rich and famous, under the efficient management of its charming concierge, M. Gustave H. When one of his favorite guests, Madame D. was suddenly murdered, Gustave becomes implicated when the Madame bequeaths a precious painting to him, to the dismay of her family. What follows is a merry and witty romp as Gustave sought to prove his innocence with the help of his loyal protégé, the young lobby boy named Zero.This fanciful story was told as a story written by an old author in the 1980s talking about his youth when spent one night interviewing the elderly Zero Moustafa, the owner of the hotel, way past its prime in the late 1960s. I thought this layered story-telling style of a tale within a tale within a tale is totally delightful and inspired.Old European charm and gentility is stamped all over this film. The production design should be commended for those beautiful sets. The hotel and the mansion of Madame Z. especially were both so deliciously grand and ornate. The period costumes were amazing in their detail and sense of humor. The actions sequences were done like silent movies from the 1920s -- totally fun.The main actor is Ralph Fiennes as M. Gustave. This multi-faceted actor can really do no wrong. Now, you can even add comedy to his list of talents. His comedic timing was flawless. The rest of the cast was a merry mix of Oscar-caliber actors, winners and nominees alike. The elder Zero was played by F. Murray Abraham, who had not been seen in a mainstream movie since he won the Oscar Best Actor in 'Amadeus' (1984). We also see Adrian Brody, Tilda Swinton, Soarsie Ronan, Harvey Keitel, Willem Dafoe, Bill Murray, Jude Law, Tom Wilkinson, Edward Norton, Jeff Goldblum, Owen Wilson. This all-star cast were all on point in their portrayals in their small but marked roles.I thoroughly enjoyed watching this film. It is delightful. It is charming. It is the most fun I have had watching a Wes Anderson film since 'The Fantastic Mr. Fox.'",9,0,7,26 April 2014
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," The Mission Impossible Franchise is Alive Once Again For Me!
","The first Mission Impossible film disappointed me very much. I was a fan of the original MI TV series. I thought the first MI film stripped everything good about the TV series and made it a one-man show for its star, Tom Cruise. So much was my disappointment that I did not even care to watch the second and third installments. However, the trailers for this fourth installment, with its exploding Kremlin and the hi-jinx in the Dubai glass skyscraper captured my attention. Also, the presence of Jeremy Renner as a new co-star also added to my interest to see this one. And I am sure glad I did.All the action promised in the trailer were delivered in high style, and more! Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his team were accused of blowing up the Kremlin, and were thus left high and dry by the US government. As they move on their own to prove their innocence, at the same time they had to avert a nuclear catastrophe that would bring about another world war. This plot took the audience from Budapest to Moscow to Dubai and to Mumbai as Hunt and his team (Simon Pegg, Paula Patton and Jeremy Renner) follow the trail of mad nuclear terrorist Kurt Hendricks (Michael Nyqvist). Tom Cruise does show signs of age here already, but he is as invincible as ever. Simon Pegg is entertaining as the computer nerd, and comic relief. Paula Patton I have never seen before, but she is an exotic beauty and realistic Amazon. Jeremy Renner adds another feather to his impressive acting cap since 'The Hurt Locker.' Aside from the Kremlin and Burj Khalifa scenes I have mentioned, there were also exciting foot and car chases throughout the film, particularly impressive were those shot in a huge sandstorm. There were also old- fashioned fist-fights thrown in to balance out the hi-tech computer stuff. Of course, I had to suspend disbelief for a lot of the seemingly physically-impossible stunts pulled off, especially on the Burj. But they looked very good on screen! Director Brad Bird was able to achieve his animated-style vision into startlingly-convincing live action. This will surely satisfy any action movie fan, as it did me. The teamwork required to achieve their mission was showcased front and center. That renewed my faith in the franchise and I look forward to their next adventure.",9,12,29,16 December 2011
Revolutionary Road," Why Was Leo Shut Out of Awards???
","The moment I heard that Leonardo di Caprio and Kate Winslet had another movie together last year, I was stoked to watch it. When it earned both of them Golden Globe nominations and Kate won Best Actress, the more I wanted to watch this. So was it worth all the expectations? It turns out that this is a movie that is very uncomfortable to watch, especially as a couple. I watched this by myself, and I was thinking how it would be if my wife watched it with me. It portrays the story of Frank and April Wheeler, an idealistic young couple in the 1950s who live in a nice suburban house along Revolutionary Road. It traces their gradual emotional deterioration as a couple until it reaches an inevitable conclusion.'Revolutionary Road' was written by males, both the book and the script. I do not know about the book, but this movie was clearly written from the male point of view. I may sound sexist, but the character of April is so maddeningly irrational! I do not fully understand what she really wants. Though Frank is no saint himself, I empathize with the frustration of Frank as he tries to put up with the inexplicable moods of his wife.Kate Winslet was predictably good in this role, which is very much reminiscent of her turn in another suburban housewife in 'Little Children' last year. But for me, it was Leonardo di Caprio who totally succeeded in inhabiting his role of Frank. He was very good in delineating the exasperation Frank must be feeling being caught in such a depressing situation. I personally think Leo's portrayal of Frank had much more depth than Brad Pitt's Benjamin Button.Kate Winslet had been quoted to say that she felt Leo di Caprio is her second husband (after director Sam Mendes) and they do look like a real married couple on screen. They really look good together there, so this makes the twisted storyline more heartbreaking to witness. I cannot believe that both of them were shut out of Oscar nominations.The surprise Oscar nominee that seemingly came out of nowhere was Michael Shannon as Best Supporting Actor. Shannon played John Givings, a psychiatrically-ill math genius (and son of their landlady) who seemed to be the only person who could read the true thoughts of the embattled couple. He was only in two scenes, but he made his mark despite the limited screen time.Sam Mendes gives us another tragic view of suburban America as he did in his Oscar-winning 'American Beauty.' As with 'Beauty,' someone from my background would feel that everything seems over the top and unrealistic. Is it? People do not really talk or behave that way, do they?",8,0,2,24 January 2009
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," The Trailer Basically Tells Us the Story, But the Film was still Very Good
","At first, I did not plan to watch 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes.' I actually felt that the preview trailer already pretty much tells us the whole story already. This is a movie that will give us the explanation how a race of super-intelligent apes had over-run the Earth and replaced humans as the dominant species which was the scenario in the 1968 classic film 'The Planet of the Apes' (with Charlton Heston and Roddy McDowall).While I was watching, I found that yes, my fears about the trailer telling us too much were not unfounded. However, in the movie itself, we see the human back story of the Rodmans and their relationship with the mutant ape Caesar so much better. We see how the worsening dementia of his Dad (John Lithgow) drives scientist Will Rodman (James Franco) to develop a virus-based anti-Alzheimer's medication. Very interesting and intelligent. This story line covers the origin of the super-IQ and super-abilities of the apes, as well as sows the seeds of the virus that will eventually eradicate the human race. We also get to see and hear Tom Felton (sans his Slytherin robes) deliver a classic movie line in tribute to the first Apes movie.Watching the whole film also makes us admire the talent of one Andy Serkis even more as he was able to convey the emotion of the central ape Caesar with nary a word for majority of the film. His eyes, that stare, his body language, say it all. Caesar's final moment with Will was amazing and can send chills down anyone's spine, a real screen moment. If there is justice, Andy Serkis should at least be nominated for a Best Actor Oscar even though we do not really see his real face and body on screen. Being on screen for almost the whole film, Serkis has even surpassed his acclaimed motion-capture performance as Gollum in 'The Lord of the Rings' films.",8,2,4,9 August 2011
Gone Girl," Rosamund Pike's Breakthrough: She Was Fearless and Fearsome
","Five years ago, laidback Missourian Nick Dunne married gorgeous and smart New Yorker Amy. On their fifth wedding anniversary, Nick comes home to find their living room a big mess and his wife missing. Media hype hounds and persecutes him as police detectives turn up evidence that indicating that Nick killed Amy. Nick denies these allegations, but there seems to be no more way out for him.I was not a fan of Ben Affleck as an actor. I thought his best role was that of the ham actor in 'Shakespeare in Love' because he was basically playing himself. In this film though, Ben Affleck actually does a great job essaying this role of Nick. His character needed to teeter between guilt and innocence, and Affleck effectively handled this tricky balance. We should not know how we should feel for him in the first act. But by the last act, the audience, especially the men, would feel his helplessness.I was also not a fan of Rosamund Pike. I thought she was just a pretty face but rather dull, icy and without passion when she acts. All that totally changed with her riveting performance as Amy. It is difficult to describe her performance without dropping a spoiler, so I have to stop right there. Suffice it to say, this performance is her breakthrough as a serious actress. It was fearless, and fearsome.David Fincher is an amazing director. I have been a fan since 'Se7en'. He had an amazing filmography since directing iconic videos of Madonna ('Express Yourself') and Paula Abdul ('Straight Up') back in the 1980s, including films like 'Fight Club', 'Zodiac','The Social Network', 'Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' and now this one. This guy just keep on improving in his aesthetics. I have not yet read the book by Gillian Flynn , who also wrote the screenplay, but the storytelling skills of Fincher were flawless in this film. It kept on surprising the audience up to the very end. His fluid style makes us look beyond certain plot details which may seem questionable or even absurd. He raises serious issues about the intricacies of a married relationship and sensationalization of crime by the media.'Gone Girl' is the first film of the year that is seriously in contention for the major Oscar awards of this year. In fact, nominations for the top 5 awards: Picture, Director, Actor, Actress and Screenplay (Adapted) are all sure things as early as now, with the statuettes themselves a reasonable reality. 10/10.",10,3,18,9 October 2014
Django Unchained," How Tarantino Would Tell a Love Story
","I have learned to take Quentin Tarantino films with a sense of fun. They may have so many offensive things about them, especially the gratuitous bloody violence and the excessively foul language. But they, this is what people want out of a Quentin Tarantino film! It would not be a Quentin Tarantino film without these mercenary things! And indeed, 'Django Unchained' is a trove of them, 2 hours and 45 minutes of it!Django (Jamie Foxx) is a slave sometime before the Civil War broke out. He was rescued from his new owners by dentist/bounty hunter named Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz). As Schultz gives Django his freedom and makes him his partner, Django expressed his desire to find, rescue and reunite with his beautiful, German-speaking wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), who was now owned by the sadistic Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). All hell breaks loose in Candieland when Django unleashes all his suppressed anger to get his wife back!People who are not used to Quentin Tarantino style (or maybe even those who are) would shirk their eyes away from the screen many times for every cracking whiplash across a slave's back, every explosive shotgun shot going through a body and every bloody punch in that graphic Mandingo fight. Eventually, in the final Grand Guignol scenes, maybe everyone in the audience will already be desensitized despite the interminable fountains of blood that will shoot out of countless bodies in what seemed to be thirty minutes of continuous gunfire. That is classic Tarantino for you!The actors all attack their roles with outrageous glee. Well all, except probably the lead star Jamie Foxx, who plays it 'cool' in stark contrast with the rest of the hyper cast. Christoph Waltz already won the Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor for his role of Schultz, but honestly for me, this is practically the same type of acting I saw from him in both 'Inglorious Basterds' and 'Water for Elephants.' Now, Leonardo DiCaprio, I think he was robbed of a nomination here. He was evil incarnate here, such a different Leo from what we are used to seeing him in. Special mention would have to go to Samuel L. Jackson, whom I did not immediately recognize as the conniving Stephen, the sinister head manservant of Candieland. Those piercing eyes of his baleful glare were something else!It was a great idea to bring the spaghetti Western genre to the deep South. The music was so 70s with those jangly guitars, except for the occasional anachronistic incursion of rap music. The sense of dark humor was all over it, under all that bloodshed and gore. There was a scene with cameos of Jonah Hill, Don Johnson and their KKK masks which was outright hilarious. Funny but I realized that THIS is how Tarantino would tell a love story!But if you ask me if this will win the Oscar for Best Picture, my answer would probably be NO. I do not see this type of film appeal to generally conservative Academy voters. But the fact that it even made it to the final 9 nominees is already recognition enough for QT.",7,8,17,15 January 2013
Insidious," You may enjoy it more if you have zero expectations
","I am a horror movie fan and I try to catch horror movies that get a good word-of-mouth. This movie 'Insidious' is one such movie, with some critics giving it an A rating, very rare in the horror genre.'Insidious' involves a child, and that is usually a positive thing among horror classics, like 'The Exorcist,' 'The Omen' and 'Poltergeist' to 'The Sixth Sense' and 'The Others.' Little Dalton Lambert suddenly falls into an unexplained coma one day, with no plausible medical explanation. From then on, their house began to manifest various ghostly goings-on that scares the living hell out of his parents Josh (Patrick Wilson) and Renai (Rose Byrne). Pushed to the wall, they consult paranormal 'experts' to solve their supernatural problems. Can Dalton still be saved?The device used to explain what happened to Dalton and what can be done to deal with the situation was quite ingeniously conceived by the writer Leigh Whannell. However, the execution though by the director James Wan is a tad disappointing in several parts. This movie pulls out all of the traditional horror tricks to make this movie scary. The shadowy darkness, the loud startling music, all to bring about a creepy atmosphere and jolting surprises and screams from the audience. The images of the ghostly tormentors while disturbing and unsettling are more weird than really scary. I believe that I may have been affected by expecting too much from this film. I was expecting an A-rated horror movie, but ended up rating it as merely an average one for the genre.",6,1,5,23 April 2011
Frozen," An Icy Tale of Two Sisters
","The latest Disney opus 'Frozen' is based on the Hans Christian Andersen's complex tale entitled 'The Snow Queen.' In this story, two close friends named Kai and Gerda were separated when splinters of an enchanted mirror enters Kai's eyes and heart and makes him hate everything he loved. The Snow Queen kisses the boy, making him forget Gerda and his family, and takes him to her frozen palace. Gerda risks all odds to locate Kai and when she finds him, her warm tears of love melts the shards of mirror from Kai's heart and eyes, and releases him from the Snow Queen's spell.'Frozen' is nothing like this story at all. Instead we only get the ice palace, someone's heart getting frozen and needing true love to be saved. The story spun around this basic story was a wholly original tale about two royal sisters. One, Elsa, had a wonderful but dangerous power to create ice and wintry weather. The other one, Anna, being normal, had been kept in the dark about her sister's power following a near-tragic accident, so the two had been estranged since childhood. When Elsa's powers were unceremoniously revealed at her own coronation as Queen, she flees and builds her own icy Winter Palace up a high mountain. Anna goes out to search for her sister, meeting a kind icemaker Kristoff, his hardy reindeer Sven, magical Trolls and a talking snowman named Olaf who join her on her quest. Can Anna mend her relationship with her sister, discover love in time, and save their kingdom from the eternal winter that envelops it?The visuals of the wintry wonderland where this animated film is set were fantastically rendered. That part where Elsa was building her palace of ice was a most wondrous scene that will inspire awe. Cute as his character may have been written, I did not like the way they drew the face of Olaf the snowman. Truth to tell, when I first saw Olaf in the trailer, I almost did not want to watch the whole film. The song that accompanied Elsa's emancipation entitled 'Let It Go' was breathtaking as sung by the incomparable voice of Idina Menzel. This was easily the best and most memorable song of the film. Many of the songs, especially by Anna, were Broadway-esque, sweeping and melodic. The Trolls and Olaf have featured quirky songs of their own. Though cute, these songs both sounded out of place from the rest of the songs.The story line of sisterly love and devotion is also a novel approach that makes this production stand out. Elsa had a unique and interesting predicament because of the powers she possessed. It would have been better I think if the film centered more on her than on Anna. The fact that this film had two female heroines will make this appeal more to the young female demographic.",8,0,2,9 December 2013
2012," Wasted Opportunity for a More Powerful Message
","2012 is just barely 3 years away, and this movie reminds us that Mayan, Chinese and Biblical sources all are telling us that year would bring with it the end of days as we know it.The movie is big stuff. It looks expensive from the trailers alone. Watching the film itself though is another matter. This is already the third disaster movie by director Ronald Emmerich, after 'Independence Day' and 'The Day After Tomorrow' (unless you count 'Eight Legged Freaks'). I do not really know how a film of this immense magnitude can give the feeling of being so shallow. There was a great potential for this movie to deliver a powerful message here. But unfortunately, we get a cartoon-like movie with the most corny and downright cheesy scenes and dialog.Don't get me wrong, there are several edifying and unprecedented images like that of the White House being destroyed by an runaway aircraft carrier, or that of flooding in the Himalayas. But scenes like those when John Cusack was driving his limo through falling buildings from Pasadena to Sta. Monica Airport, or his getting out alive from a camper swallowed up by the gaping earth at Yellowstone are too ridiculously over-the-top to be any good. Definitely one close call too many.As for the characters, they are too one-dimensional and too unbelievably super-human to care about. The wild character of Woody Harrelson was too nutty to be likable. In truth, I only liked the geologist Adrian Helmsley (played by Chiwetel Ejiofor), his Indian geologist friend and the family of the Tibetan monk. They had scenes of genuine pathos amidst the chaos.",6,0,3,19 November 2009
The Number 23," A letdown in general
","Jim Carrey surprises us here by appearing in a serious mystery suspense movie. In the beginning, we can still recognize his smart-alecky sense of humor, but this disappears as the movie follows the paranoid obsession experienced by the protagonist, Walter Sparrow.I like the fact that his whole family is involved in the development of his problem. I like the father-son relationship displayed, as Walter interacts with his son from beginning to end. His wife is played very well by Virginia Madsen. I was about to say 'played very smartly', however, I remembered that it was her critical yet inexplicable action in the beginning of the movie that triggered the whole tragic chain reaction Walter had to undergo.Bottomline, I expected something more. The weak set-up made the ensuing problem situation was too contrived. Despite majority opinion, I was satisfied with the ending. It is just that the route that director Joel Schumacher took towards that ending was unsatisfying.",5,5,23,23 February 2007
The Lives of Others," Simple, Direct and Triumphant
","I watched this movie because it won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language film of 2006. This film won over the more high profile 'Pan's Labyrinth' which recently topped a list of best foreign language films of this decade. Naturally I was very curious to check it out.The story is set in Communist East Germany in the 80s. It was about the notorious surveillance of the dreaded Stasi on suspected 'enemies of the state.' In this case, Agent Wiesler (Ulrich Muhe) was tasked by his superior Grubitz (chillingly portrayed Ulrich Tukur)to spy on the goings-on in the house of prominent playwright Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch)and his girlfriend and lead actress Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck).However, despite the veteran that he was, Wiesler becomes sympathetically involved in the lives of the people he is supposed to observe. This is especially when it was revealed that the surveillance had been ordered by Cultural Minister Bruno Hempf (a very greasy Thomas Thieme), not for national security reasons, but only because he selfishly wanted to get rid of Dreyman in order to have Sieland for himself.The situation is very claustrophobic and may become boring, but it doesn't. This is a testament to the success of its solid direction by then newcomer Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck. It also holds the audience's interest because of the very effective acting of the lead actors. The main actor is not Koch nor Gedeck, instead the focus of the movie is on Wiesler, the character played by Muhe. We clearly see his character develop from a heartless government agent and inquisitor into a man who followed his heart rather than his head, and fully accepted the consequences of his actions.Overall, this movie is very good as a study of the political situation in East Germany back then, as well as an excellent character study of the people caught up in this situation. It is worth the time invested to watch it.Now whether it deserved to win the Oscar over 'Pan's Labyrinth,' that is a bigger question. Definitely the delivery of the message in 'The Lives of Others' is simple and direct, while the approach in 'Pan's Labyrinth' is allegorical and metaphorical. Comparing apples and oranges, It boils down to a matter of taste among the jurors who voted. Both films are excellent in their own ways.",8,0,0,26 July 2009
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Ben Stiller's Labor of Love
","'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty' is a short story written by James Thurber way back in 1939. It was about a henpecked man who escapes into a fantasy world of danger and heroics to compensate for the depressingly dull real life he leads.Screen writer Steve Conrad adapts the title and the name and over-active imagination of the main character and tells his own original story. Ben Stiller directs and stars in this obvious 'labour of love' of a movie project.Walter Mitty is a timid guy who tends to 'space out' and enter into a world of his own where he is able to do wondrously heroic exploits. He would rather join an online dating service than to meet this girl Cheryl at work that he fancies. One day, he misplaced the precious negative of the photograph meant to be the cover of the last issue of Life Magazine. As his job is on the line, Walter needs to look for Sean, the globe-trotter photographer who took that missing photo. Upon deducing that Sean was in Greenland, Mitty suddenly decides to throw all caution to the wind and just go on a difficult quest, which will be the biggest adventure of his lifetime.Visually, this film is perfect with its breathtaking cinematography and unobtrusive special effects. Many scenes, particularly those showing Walter skateboarding in Iceland, or climbing the Himalayas, were very memorably shot with unique camera range and angles. The script does fall into melodrama, but I did not mind this. Ben Stiller was very good as Walter, capturing his shyness and cluelessness so sensitively. I liked Walter's moments with his mother, played by Shirley McLaine in a subdued likable manner. I also liked Walter's awkward romance with Cheryl played by Kristen Wiig, in only the second role I have seen her since 'Bridesmaids.' She was also very relaxed and natural here in a straight role. Too bad we do not see the full strength of her comic skills.I cannot deny that I was disappointed with how the story went. Once we reach the second half of the film when Walter actually stops having fantasies and does things for real already. I know of course that this was the point of the film, that dreams were there to be fulfilled. I just felt it somehow lost the spirit of the source short story.Overall though, this was an entertaining feel-good film that will bring us to places we rarely see on screen. The spectacular photography of the exotic settings demand that you see this film on the big screen. Despite lofty comparisons with Forrest Gump, Walter Mitty admittedly does not exactly reach those heights. However, upon watching this film, you will wonder how something so beautiful-looking could have been totally shut-out from Oscar or any other award consideration.",8,14,20,21 January 2014
The Mist," An All-Genre Modern Horror Classic
","After suffering though a bad horror movie ('One Missed Call'), finally I get to watch a great one. The pedigree is there as this is derived from a Stephen King novella, and directed by Frank Darabont. One of my favorite movies of all time is 'The Shawshank Redemption', which came with similar credentials.A severe storm causes a mist to form around a Maine township. The main characters are trapped in a supermarket as this mist carries with it abominable monsters that seek to devour the populace. I know what you are thinking, that sounds like the plot a lame B-movie. However, in the hands of the director, writers and actors, this was translated into a chilling and disturbing morality play that transcends the baseness of the plot.The movie follows main character David Drayton (played by Thomas Jane) as he brings his young son to the local supermarket to buy supplies after the storm. While they were inside, strange mist envelopes everything in town around them. Later it becomes obvious that the mist is not as innocent as it seems. There are blood-thirsty monsters that dwell in it, so no one could get out.As expected, the longer they stayed trapped inside the supermarket, tensions began to rise as Drayton begins to have conflicts among the other townspeople with strong personalities . There was a lawyer Mr. Norton (Andre Braugher) who did not believe the monsters exist. And above all, there was Mrs. Carmody (sinisterly played by Marcia Gay Harden, in full camp), an unstable fire-and-brimstone religious fanatic. The tumultuous and violent interactions of these characters are so realistically palpable, that the audience is drawn into their difficult situation, fantastic as it maybe.The tension is held throughout the two hours of screen time until the unbelievable climax. The ending is one that will disturb and haunt you. You will never forget it. (Not that I necessarily agree with what they decided to do...)'This Mist' is an all-genre film. Aside from the blood and gore, there were scenes of heart-pounding action, drama, sci-fi, and even philosophical discussions, as well as religious ranting and persecution. This certainly lifts it beyond the run of the mill horror flick, and I would consider this a modern classic of the genre, together with 'The Sixth Sense' and 'The Others'. Well recommended for lovers of horror films, like me.",7,0,2,7 February 2008
The Bourne Legacy," It Did Not Really Matter That It Was Shot in Manila...
","'The Bourne Legacy' has so much hype in my country not only because it rides on the coattails of the amazing Bourne Trilogy starring Matt Damon. Even more significantly, it is due to the fact that a considerable number of scenes had been shot right here locally, in such places as the San Andres Market, the Pasay Rotonda, the Navotas Fishport and Palawan. The shooting of the movie was front page news and was on the daily evening news shows. When the trailer showing the Manila scenes was released, it trended massively on online social networking sites. Everything pointed to a widely successful August 8, 2012 opening date. Unfortunately though, Mother Nature had other ideas, as one of the metropolis' worst monsoon flooding which inundated many parts of the city happened before and right on that day. All of a sudden, 'The Bourne Legacy' did not seem that important anymore.I personally felt that this movie, while very exciting at parts, did not really live up to the quality of the first three Bourne movies. The lead actors Jeremy Renner (as Treadstone Agent Aaron Cross) and Rachel Weiss (as geneticist-virologist Dr. Marta Shearer) did very well in the acting department to keep the scenes vital. However, the story (for a Bourne movie) was uncharacteristically sketchy and really, barely there.This film follows the aftermath of the third Bourne film when his agency Treadstone was already being investigated and threatened with exposure. All remaining Treadstone agents were being systematically eradicated. Cross and Shearer have to evade the government counter forces led by Eric Byer (Edward Norton), who did not really feel like a real danger for our heroes. We learn the 'scientific' reason why Treadstone agents have super-human abilities, which was too incredible. The Manila connection was weak and unbelievable. The street chase scenes in Manila were a big blur, and basically what we already saw in the trailer. The ending felt rushed and too convenient. If you knew Philippine geography, the final scenes would be funny.I don't know, but I think I simply expected too much from this movie. It has all the Bourne elements there, but it felt lacking. It was only the charisma and talent of the stars that carried the film. I was disappointed that it did not really show anything iconically Filipino to represent the country. I don't think the 'jeepney' really counts. The slums used could have been any slum in the world. Nothing really positive about the Manila or its people was shown, which was a letdown. If ever there is a sequel though, I would still watch if only for Renner and Weisz, and maybe to find out what else can be done to liven up this series. I would not really count on that sequel too soon though.",6,4,15,9 August 2012
22 Jump Street," Isn't It Bromantic?
","'21 Jump Street' was a pleasant surprise when it was released two years ago. Instead of the lame comedy rip-off of a classic 80s TV series that it was expected to be, it turned out to be a rip-roaring action comedy delight. The comedic chemistry between Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum was sizzling and carried the film through its absurd premise of adult cops undercover as high school students.In this sequel '22 Jump Street', Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) were sent undercover to college this time with the mission of uncovering the truth about the death of a coed involved with a new party drug called 'Whyphy'. As the investigation of the case got underway, Jenko meets a kindred spirit in Zook (Wyatt Russell), a frat boy and football jock, who thought and acted exactly like Jenko did. Schmidt hooks up with a pretty art major named Maya (Amber Stevens), but he is majorly distressed that Jenko is getting more and more into fraternity life and football and was steadily drifting away from their partnership. Action peaks in a wild spring break party on the beach where 'Whyphy' gang threatens to spread the drug big time to more college students. Schimdt and Jenko have to get their acts together in time to prevent that from happening.Again, Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum throw all shame to the wind and go all out in going for the laughs. Their chemistry together works as well now as it worked back then. The squirmy scene where Schmidt and Jenko are in session with a shrink is particularly hilarious.Hill acts as he usually acts as the dorky misfit. He really can't go wrong with that face of his. He really has a natural talent for physical comedy. But it was Tatum who steps up more in this sequel as he fearlessly makes fun of his him-bo image. Tatum's athletic skills are also highlighted in many exciting scenes. Ice Cube steals his scenes as their ill-tempered foul- mouthed boss, Captain Dickon. He would figure in what I thought was the most jaw-droppingly awkward and outright LOL scene of the film.The humor of this film is very shallow and can even offensive for some people, but truth to tell, it is really very funny. If you don't mind the mile-a-minute profanity-laden script with heavy sexual or drug- themes, you will be laughing from start to finish with the misfortunes and misadventures of Schmidt and Jenko. The laughs carry on all the way up to the closing credits where they mock their own possible future sequels in a montage that is a must-see in itself.",8,3,8,19 June 2014
Cars 2," Mater may be a good Sidekick, but a good Lead he is not!
","'Cars 2' is an unusual case of a highly anticipated film that was not simultaneously released here locally as in the States. I wonder why? Anyway after I watched this film, I think I know why. For all the positive goodwill that the first Cars film had, this film was a relative disappointment.I will not knock the artwork. This definitely maintains the high standards that elevate all Pixar films with regards to quality of animation. The racing and hi-jinx spy sequences done in familiar landmark locales all over the world were all very excellently rendered. There was action in the roads, underwater and the skies. This time we get to see talking boats and planes, aside from just the titular cars. For me the problem was with the story. I think the complex spy story that underlies this installment, and the highfalutin spy lingo it uses, flies over the comprehension of the young kiddie audience it caters to. I do not think kids would fully understand about the issues on alternative fuels or on 'lemon' cars. These 'adult' issues that motivate the villains' violent actions will make it hard for kids to really get the story without parental explanation. I think it was not too cool to see cars being 'killed' in some very violent scenes. I do not think it was a good idea to kids to see their gentle favorite Mater with rocket boosters and machine guns.Contrary to most expectations, Lightning McQueen is NOT the hero of Cars 2. The central character in this one is Mater, whom we knew as the loyal sidekick. Unfortunately, for me at least, Mater did not cut it as leading man. His awkward country bumpkin demeanor and hick-town country drawl were only funny from the side, but was rather hard to take when it was front and center most of the time. After Mater, the cars with more screen time than McQueen were British spy cars Finn McMissile and Holley Shiftwell. While they were both quintessentially cool British secret agents, they also blow the beloved 'heart and soul' of the first Cars movie out of this film's focus. You hardly even see Sally and the rest of the Radiator Springs gang. It was also that the focus of the whole film was more the 'James Bond'-like spy story, while the races were merely incidental.",6,11,17,24 July 2011
Kick-Ass," Be Ready for Graphic Violence from an 11-Year Old Girl!
","I never got to watch 'Kick Ass' when it was first released in 2010. Now with the sequel in local theaters this week, several people recommend that I should probably watch this first installment first before I watch Part 2. So I did.I did not know exactly what this film was about so I was surprised when this film and its sequel had posters of what looked like kid superheroes, yet the rating is R-16! Now that I have finished watching Part 1, the answer is very clear.'Kick Ass' tells the story of Dave Lizewsky, a nerdy guy who decide that he wanted to be a real superhero like those in the comic books he loves to read. He buys himself a dorky green uniform and tries to fight petty criminals around town as Kick Ass. Unfortunately he had absolutely no fighting skills. However, his exploits apparently inspired a ultra-war-freak father- daughter team to don superhero uniforms themselves as Big Daddy and Hit Girl. Can these new superheroes stand up to the very real threat of the evil crime boss Frank D'Amico, his son Chris (who also took on a superhero persona Red Mist) and their entire gangster organization?While Aaron Johnson does well as the titular character Dave/Kick Ass, the more memorable actor and character in this whole film is Chloe Moretz as Hit Girl. It was disconcerting to see a real 11-year old girl do all the killing Hit Girl did because this film did NOT sugarcoat any violence. THIS IS GRAPHIC STUFF! OK, it is CG but still very bloody graphic. However for some perverse underlying reason, Hit Girl was great movie character! This movie sets up Part 2 very well, and yes, I am now quite excited to watch it as well. Now I know exactly what I am getting into. I am eager to see how the lessons Kick Ass and Hit Girl learned about being heroes here in Part 1 will affect their characters in Part 2. I am also itching to see how Red Mist steps up his game to be a worthy adversary.",7,3,4,20 August 2013

","'Unknown' has Liam Neeson as botanist Dr. Martin Harris who was to be presenting at a biotechnology conference in Berlin. He figured in a bad car accident which put him into a four-day coma. When he woke up, he had no ID on him. No one knows him, not even his own wife! Some random guy has taken his identity, his life and wife.

He has to quickly figure out what was going on, as an assassination plot is afoot and he seems to be involved in it!Liam Neeson is one of those actors, like Nicolas Cage, who have a long thriving career in much smaller films after their splashy debuts in Oscar-caliber movies. Two years ago, he came out with a sleeper hit called 'Taken.' You will definitely think of 'Taken' when you watch 'Unknown'. Both of them have Liam Neeson in a European country with fights and car chases. With the success of 'Unknown,' I won't be surprised if he turns up in another European capital with another caper.The set-up of the situation Neeson gets into happens within the first 15 minutes or so. You will really feel Neeson's frustration as he desperately tries to prove his identity, with everything and everyone else going against him. You really have to suspend your disbelief as you watch. There were too many coincidences. There were too many unrealistic stunts. There were scenes that seemed inconsistent with the harsh Berlin winter setting. This movie would also have us believe that Neeson's character was born in 1966, which I felt was its biggest stretch. Anyway, don't think too hard. Just sit back and enjoy the non- stop action.",6,1,3,3 March 2011
Shrek the Third," Not Enough to be at level of first 2!
","The movie did not really hold the attention of my two younger kids. Even for me, the funny experience of watching both Shrek 1 and 2 was not really very evident with this installment. I remember in Shrek 2, I was laughing out loud with each passing pop culture reference and innuendo being bantered around. However, that was not so here.I was not too amused with the Disney princesses characters. Shrek's 'baby nightmare scene' was well-executed. Justin Timberlake did well in voicing his 'grovelling at Merlin's feet' scene. Overall, this movie was not that bad, but it needed to be much better to be worthy to stand on the same level as the first two Shrek films.",6,161,225,19 May 2007
The Hurt Locker," Gritty and Realistic
","I got interested in this movie because of rave reviews I read in the Internet. It is a story of an American bomb disposal unit on tour of duty in Iraq. The film just follows their day to day activities and missions there. You see the squalor and violence of life in Iraq after the American occupation. You see the thanklessness and the uselessness of this war for the citizens of Iraq and the American troops stationed over there. You see everything as if it was real thing, as if this was a documentary. Everything was very gritty and realistic.There were many suspenseful situations of bomb disposal. You do not know which ones will be successful and which one won't, leading to very intense moments. The soundtrack music and the rough camera work contribute immensely to the tension and drama. We the audience are transported there with the soldiers in Iraq, it seems to be.The unknown lead actors contribute to the realism. They looked and acted like real soldiers. This is most specially true with Jeremy Renner (whom I have never seen before), who played the bomb specialist James with so much immersion you would think he is the real thing. I do not really know why they decided to interrupt the realism with occasional star cameos (from Ralph Fiennes and Evangeline Lilly). I do not really know what a 'hurt locker' is, and I still do not exactly. But I guess it means how the hurtful experiences of war will forever be locked into the very beings of the people caught up in it. A final surprise for me came at the end as I found out that this very macho film was assuredly directed by a woman, Kathryn Bigelow. Fans of war movies will definitely want to watch this film.",6,3,9,24 June 2009
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," An Climax That Makes You Forget the Rest of the Film
","'The Amazing Spider-Man 2' is a very long movie, lasting for two hours and a half. But as you go out of the theater, you will only remember and talk about one thing -- an ending that is so numbing that it just about overshadows everything else that happens in the film. But that is getting ahead of me.In this sequel of the Mark Webb reboot of Spider-Man with Andrew Garfield as the web-slinger, we follow the story of Peter and Gwen (Emma Stone) as they graduate from college and their relationship gets complicated by Peter's sideline as Spider-Man. Meanwhile, a nerdy engineer in Oscorp, Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx), gains super electrical powers when he falls into a tank of electric eels, later terrorizing the city as glowing blue Electro. Peter finally learns the truth about his dad's (Dougray Scott) disappearance via a recorded message he found in an abandoned station. Harry Osborne (Dane DeHaan) returns to take over Oscorp when his father died, and reconnects with his old friend Peter. But as he desperately seeks out a cure for a deadly familial disease he has inherited from his father, he winds up as the Green Goblin. After all of that, we still get to see the Rhino terrorize the city before the film ends.The chick-flick parts of the film really work out very well, thanks to the excellent screen chemistry between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone. They had so many zippy one-liners between it was fun to watch. The action parts were excellent with all the wondrous computer-generated special effects about Spider-Man's fancy web-swinging skills, to Electro's dazzling pyrotechnics which take up most of the film. DeHaan's Green Goblin appearance was just in a single short fight sequence towards the end. And Paul Giamatti's turn as the mechanized Rhino was only a glorified cameo at best in the epilogue.The whole angle about Peter's dad Richard, while undoubtedly of great dramatic importance, I felt was out of place in the whole film in terms of story-telling, unnecessarily making the film feel too long and over- stuffed. Whatever Peter found out about his dad did not seem to matter at all when it comes to the events in this film.Overall though, I felt that while this was a good film, it just tried to tell a lot of stories, getting carried away with too many ongoing story lines. Ultimately, it was buoyed up by the wonderful central performances of Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone as Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy, which sets it apart as more than just a mere CG- effects- extravaganza. Their effective portrayals of these two lovers gave this film a lot of depth and heart.",7,0,9,30 April 2014
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," The Movie Fulfills the Cinematic Promise of the Book
","Just came home from watching probably the most hyped and anticipated movie of the year. It had an unwieldy title 'The Twilight Saga: New Moon' for those who lived under a rock and did not know that this was the sequel to 'Twilight.' I have read the book before, and expected this to be a better movie than 'Twilight.' 'New Moon' the book had the best cinematic promise of the first three books, and the movie fulfills that promise very well. The parts about the wolves, the cliff jumping and of course, the Volturi in Italy were as exciting as I imagined them. The quality of the special effects during the wolf scenes and the fight scenes with Volturi were excellent.After the movie, my wife was on Team Jacob. The character of Jacob Black is the best written main character in the Twilight Saga books, and it reflects here also in the movie. It is easiest to empathize with Jacob's situation, than with the distantly cold Edward or the confusingly conflicted Bella. The young teenage actor Taylor Lautner portrayed him very well, both physically and emotionally. A loud collective gasp was heard when Taylor removed his t-shirt (gratuitously) to reveal his body for the first time(among many). I found that hilarious. Of course, this could not be the Twilight Saga without the classically cheesy scenes and lines, especially those that involved Edward. The ultimate in cheese would be that laughable 'Edward and Bella running in the woods' scene. It was so awkward I do not know why Robert Pattinson allowed it to appear on screen.Overall, 'New Moon' is a better movie than the first 'Twilight' film. I am not really looking forward to the next one (due out in the summer of 2010) because I found 'Eclipse' to be the worst of the three books I had read. But I'm sure we will also be watching it. The ending scene and final line is probably one of the best cliffhangers in recent memory.",7,5,23,20 November 2009
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Fun and Entertaining Comic Book Fare!
","I went into this movie with no high expectations. And yes, I was thoroughly entertained by it. It was a good comic book movie. For me it was just the right mix of action, humor (naughty at that), and drama (not too much Spiderman-like angst), rolled into one fine exciting package. All four heroes had their moments to shine action-wise and character-wise.As in the first film, Chris Evans stole his scenes, both as Johnny Storm and as The Human Torch. This time, there was even some dramatic character development for that character. They just had to include one gratuitous scene of Johnny clad in only a towel for his female fans.I don't know why, but Jessica Alba still did not look like the correct choice for Invisible Woman. I also don't know why her hair style looks very fake in a lot of scene, particularly the one set in a Japanese garden, where it was truly fixed up horrendously.The Silver Surfer was truly a star in this film. His cool appearance and action sequences are great to watch. I was surprised to note in the credits that the voice was given by Lawrence Fishburne. Great choice, as he delivered the few lines of the Surfer with just the right mix of sinisterness and dignity.",7,2,5,3 July 2007
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," What DID Benjamin Learn in his Life?
","This is the first movie I have seen this year, and it is a fine David Fincher masterpiece. But here in 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button', Fincher tackles a story furthest from his previous masterpieces, 'Se7en' and 'Zodiac.' This movie is based loosely from a short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald, with the main idea of being born old and growing younger with the passing of years . The story can fit into a single web page, but this movie takes this plot point and stretches it to nearly three hours of cinematic time.This film has been compared to 'Forrest Gump' because of several parallelisms between the two movies. They are both long films that depict the passage of time with a series of episodes in the lead character's life. Maybe because they both happen to share one scriptwriter, Mr. Eric Roth? But while Forrest Gump is an active participant in the events (like in Vietnam or the pingpong), Benjamin Button was more of a passive observer of the people and events around him.This is my main reservation about the movie in general. I felt it would have been better if they had spent more time in the part where Benjamin is an wise old man with youthful looks. Ironically, at the time when he is older and already supposed to have all the experiences behind him, he looked younger but without any apparent wisdom. In fact, it seems he became more reckless and irresponsible as he grew older. This sort of limits the performance of Brad Pitt as well. When Benjamin looked like he was 12 years old, he already had dementia, so we never really learn what this type of living backwards in time has achieved in him.As for Cate Blanchett's character Daisy, we see her development more clearly as this was described in detail by Benjamin in his diary. I really like that sequence of scenes depicting how a series of small events led to a most unfortunate accident. I liked that montage of touching scenes showing how old Daisy took care of the demented child Benjamin. My main issue with her character was her attraction to the old child Benjamin. When and why did it happen? This was not clearly explained.The movie is long, yes, but it is engaging and you will want to know what happens next. The photography is luminous, both intimate and panoramic. Being a story that spans practically the entire 20th century, the costumes, set design and make-up are meticulous. Since Benjamin was born old, there are special effects to execute what happens to his body as he gains in years. While the effects to make Brad Pitt look old may be easier to imagine, how they make him regain the fresh youthful face we saw in 'Thelma and Louise' at a certain point is really amazing.",8,4,7,8 January 2009
Transformers," No need to be a fan of the cartoon to enjoy this movie!!!
","When the movie began it felt like a serious modern war movie here, not unlike Black Hawk Down or Jarhead or something of that sort. But then when that the Scorpion robot showed up, there was no mistaking this movie at all. What can you expect from Michael Bay but the best action sequences. He is really a master of action movies ('The Rock', 'Armageddon'). All very close-up with bone-crushing detail. Very impressive robot effects, whether the small Frenzy (who turned into a CD player on Air Force One) or the gigantic Optimus Prime, all are very realistic! Great looking vehicles all around. A great man's movie overall. Add to that the palpable sentiments of loyalty and heroism.Interesting back story about an explorer in the Arctic Circle at the turn of the 20th century to connect to present hero Sam (Shia LaBeouf) and the very presence of the Transformers here on Earth. There's also humor in a lot of scenes. Notably the scenes where Bumblebee helps Sam score with Mikaela with some well-timed cheesy 70s and 80s love songs on the radio. Also the scenes when Sam's parents barge into Sam's room while the Autobots are impatiently waiting in the garden.One of the most entertaining movies overall this season. And you certainly need not be a fan of the old cartoon series to enjoy this.",8,0,6,1 July 2007
Lincoln," More About Emancipation of Slaves Than About Lincoln Himself
","Ever since I saw the first poster of Steven Spielberg's 'Lincoln', with the intense Daniel Day-Lewis in excellent Lincoln make-up, I immediately knew this would already be seriously in the running during the Oscar Awards. And this was confirmed recently when this film garnered Oscar nominations in 12 categories. This is really a must-see film.This film was only about the political (and some personal) travails Lincoln experienced as he was trying to pass the 13th Amendment or the Emancipation Proclamation through Congress. This is not a biographical film at all as I was expecting. There were no scenes of his birth, childhood, education, rise in politics, etc. I felt this movie was deceptively titled. The technical aspects of this film were excellent as the cinematography, production design, costumes and make-up (not nominated!) were flawless. The color palette was muted to give it an authentic historical feel. Spielberg's obsessive attention to details and sentimentality, known from all his former films, was in full display here.The acting was so perfectly attuned to the time period the actors were set in. Daniel Day Lewis IS Abraham Lincoln! He was amazingly real, I did not see him as acting as much as he was being Lincoln. I initially felt Sally Field was miscast, but she eventually redeemed herself in her effective portrayal of troubled Mary Todd Lincoln. Tommy Lee Jones as abolitionist Thaddeus Stevens had his big moment when he delivered a fiery speech against those opposing the amendment.I think the main problem with this film was that it dealt with events which entailed showing people merely involved in a lot of long-winded conversations. The whole film was about 2 and a half hours long, and more than half of that time was just showing politicians talking about their pro or con views about the proposed Amendment. Admittedly for non- Americans (and maybe some Americans too as I can read on some reviews here), these scenes will seem very dry, tedious and meaningless. I was disappointed that this was not exactly the biography of Abraham Lincoln as I had been expecting. So gone was the opportunity of comparing the real way Lincoln grew up from the version I learned from another Lincoln film released in 2012 where the good President was a Vampire Hunter. Ironic too that we also did not also see the assassination we all knew would happen. Spielberg decided to present that event in another way, which I'm sure disappointed many people, including me.",6,1,6,13 January 2013
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Good Film Verison of the Hit Novel
","Usually I like to read the book first before watching the movie. In this case, reading the book first made watching the movie easier, but also made the experience a bit disappointing.I liked the way the screenplay adapted the book onto the big screen. This movie ran for over two hours, so that most of the important events in the novel are all accounted for. There were some details which were altered for cinematic purposes, but that was also OK, since it fits right into the story without altering major plot points.In the book, more pages were spent on journalist Mikael Blomkvist, the movie, on the other hand, gives practically equal, or even more, time to Lisbeth Salander, the pale thin Gothic female computer hacker with a disturbed past, facial piercings and the dragon tattoo, who helps Blomkvist solve the mystery of Harriet Vanger, who disappeared more than 20 years ago. Actress Noomi Rapace portrays the titular character Lisbeth bravely and with conviction.I say I was also disappointed in a way that having read the book cannot make me a fair judge whether the movie was able to effectively build up the suspense into the revelation of what really happened. The movie, though not exactly how I imagined some things, is a very faithful retelling of the book's events, no surprises. I am thinking maybe I should watch the 2nd movie first before reading the 2nd book, and see how that goes.",7,2,4,13 November 2010
Big Hero 6," Baymax Saves the Day (and the Film Too!)
","The city is San Fransokyo, a hybrid between San Francisco and Tokyo. Hiro Tadashi is a bored child prodigy who graduated high school at 13, and whiles his time making fighter robots. His brother Tadashi is in college under esteemed pioneer Robert Callaghan, working on his own project -- a big white inflatable robot nurse named Baymax.After Hiro develops a highly original, versatile and powerful mind- controlled microbot technology, Callaghan invites him into his program as well. However, that same fateful night, a big explosive fire breaks out at the school building with a highly tragic aftermath which would flip Hiro's world over. With Baymax as his invaluable robot sidekick, Hiro would discover that there was something more behind that fire. Hiro uses his techy genius to upgrade the abilities of Baymax, along with four of his brothers' inventor friends -- Gogo, Honey Lemon, Wasabi and Fred -- to from a group of six superheroes who sought to get to the bottom of the mystery of the man in the Kabuki mask behind the whole thing.It was only after the film that I found out that Big Hero 6 was actually a group of superheroes from Marvel Comics back in the late 1990s. This is the first Disney animated film that featured Marvel comic characters since the former acquired the latter in 2009. Disney was given license to change the appearances of the characters for the film version, Disney-fying them so to speak.While watching the film, I got the vibe of Pixar's 'The Incredibles', and even the rival company Dreamworks' 'How to Train Your Dragon.' But this film had its own memorable moments, mostly thanks to that adorable giant marshmallow of a robot, Baymax.Baymax is really a wonder to watch. His face is nothing more than a two black dots connected by a line. However he can convey so much emotion with those. A lot of the credit I guess would fall on his animators who were successful to create a genuinely cute character who is not annoying (Olaf anyone?) The voice acting of Scott Adsit also gave Baymax his kind and compassionate character. If not for Baymax, this whole film would be a generic superhero cartoon with little to remember it by. We did not really know the other four members of the team except that they were friends and classmates of Tadashi who had invented some awesome stuff. Hiro is the usual spirited Disney boy hero, but for a change this hero was no fool or weakling. His supreme intellect and engineering skills set him apart.However, these may all be just nitpicking because as a whole the film was very entertaining and enjoyable for the whole family. The animated special effects were fantastically conceived, executed and great to watch. As a sucker for films featuring brothers, I loved that the story between Hiro and Tadashi was so touchingly told. Since this is technically a Disney-Marvel film, do wait for an extra scene after ALL the end credits. The credits rolled for an interminable ten minutes before the extra scene, but these scene is a must-see and worth the long wait. This short scene features a cameo from a guy we see in cameos from most all Marvel films.",8,18,41,7 November 2014
Brave," Derivative Artwork and Naughty Heroine
","'Brave' is the story of another feisty Disney princess, given the PIXAR treatment. Her name is Merida, a Scottish princess. She is a headstrong tomboyish teenage who cannot accept the tradition espoused by her strict mother that she is to be betrothed for marriage. Therefore she resorts to witchcraft to change her fate. She really got more than what she bargained for, a shocking development of ursine proportions. She later learns that she has only a couple of days to reverse the terrible spell. Could she?'Brave' is just okay for me overall. It is still better than the last Pixar movie, 'Cars 2.' While on the surface everything looks good and glossy, especially the archery scenes, there are several things that I did NOT like about 'Brave.' Art-wise, while Merida and her fiery red hair looked great, the caricature-ish look of the Scotsmen were drawn so much like the Vikings in Dreamworks' 'How to Train Your Dragon.' The brutish barbaric culture they exhibited likewise shows very little difference from that in 'How to Train', aside from the kilts the characters wore in this movie and their Scottish accents.Screenplay-wise, 'Brave' goes a little darker and violent, and thus may be too scary or disturbing for young kids. More than that, I did not like how Merida did not immediately take responsibility for the horrible effects of the witch's spell. While many of the other Disney princesses also disobey their parents and get into trouble, those princesses themselves directly suffered the consequences of their disobedience. Here, Merida's insolence put another person in peril. Merida actually did something akin to what the Wicked Witch did in Snow White! Frankly, it is this particularly negative aspect of the story that badly affected my appreciation of this movie as a whole.",6,0,4,6 August 2012
Guardians of the Galaxy," Marvel Laughs!
","'Guardians of the Galaxy' must be the perfect summer blockbuster film! Coming from Marvel, home of the angry and angst-ridden superheroes, 'Guardians' breaks tradition and was a breath of fresh air with its super-entertaining fun all-out comedy. Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) was abducted by a spaceship led by the blue- skinned gang lord Yondu (Michael Rooker) when he was a small boy. 26 years later he is an inter-galactic outlaw self-dubbed as 'Starlord'. When he steals a mysterious metallic orb, he attracts the attention of an evil lord named Ronin (Lee Pace). Quill gets together with fellow inmates a smart-ass raccoon named Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper), a tree creature with a 3-word vocabulary named Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel), a musclebound simpleton Drax (Dave Bautista) and a sexy green-skinned warrior Gamora (Zoe Saldana) to protect the orb, which contains a powerful destructive material called the Infinity Stone and turn it over to Nova Prime (Glenn Close). I have not seen Chris Pratt act before but he is very good in both his comedy and action scenes. I thought he was able to pull off being the lead of this song. It is interesting to note that he Pratt also voice the lead character Emmet of 'The Lego Movie' one of the best movies this year so far.Save for the dramatic opening scene, the rest of this film is riotously funny. I really enjoyed the infectious soundtrack with huge and catchy 1970s hits like from 'Come and Get My Love' and 'Hooked on a Feeling' to 'Ooh Child' and 'I Want You Back.' This was so much fun. Worthy to watch again, even in IMax.",9,1,10,1 August 2014
Evil Dead," NOT Exactly What Its Hyperbolic Poster Would Have Us Believe
","I have not seen the original 1981 'Evil Dead' by Sam Raimi, so I am judging this film on its own merit, not on how loyal it was to the original. Horror film that I am, I must say I do not like blood and gore type horror films. So the fact that this film had gallons of blood and gore splattering, gushing and dripping all over the place certainly did not make me like it more.The premise was rather shallow. Five people are gathered in one lonely cabin in the woods supposedly to help one of them, Mia, get over heroin addiction. However, when one of them finds a chain-bound book in the basement and started reading the mysterious words it warned him NOT to read, then the demon awakens and the bloody mayhem begins, killing them one by one, until the inevitable last man (or woman) standing.Nothing was spared to make each member of the cast all bloodied up. There just happened to be an electric knife, a nail gun, a chainsaw, anything and everything to slice, to stab, to dismember, to maim, everything to make a gory film gory. So if you hate blood, you should not watch this at all. Gallons and gallons of blood-like liquid were used in shooting this film.As I have mentioned, I do not particularly like blood and gore type horror films. I went into this movie not knowing that this would be like 'Halloween,' 'Texas Chainsaw' or similar massacre type films. I confess I cringed and averted my eyes alright, as there were truly disgusting scenes. But I have to say that this definitely was NOT the 'astonishing,' 'astounding,' 'awesome,' and 'near perfect experience' that its hyperbolic poster would have us believe.",4,19,36,23 April 2013
Ip Man," Martial Arts Film With Breathtaking Action Yet Effectively Dramatic
","This is a biographical film following the real life story of Ip Man, who was a legendary martial arts master of the Wing Chun form, and eventual mentor to the equally legendary Bruce Lee. The story follows the story of Ip Man from a well-respected rich businessman who excelled in martial arts. Their prosperous village of Fo-Shan was occupied by Japanese troops in the late 1930s. Ip Man lost his fortune and had to work for meager wages with the rest of his townspeople. The highest Japanese officer in their area was arranging violent Japanese vs. Chinese martial arts tournaments for his perverse sense of entertainment, and Ip Man's skills caught his attention. Can Ip Man's formidable skills serve to rally the Chinese cause in the midst of their current sorry state of wartime persecution? Director Wilson Yip, along with action director Sammo Hung and choreographer Leung Siu-hung, have created a seamless series of breathtakingly memorable action sequences of awesome martial arts prowess, neatly integrated into this dramatic story of personal and national pride. In the center of all this is the fantastic portrayal of lead actor Donnie Yen. His humility and generosity as a family man and friend is counterbalanced with his graceful yet deadly skills as a martial artist. Mr. Yen effectively captures this unique spirit for all of us to cheer for and admire. This is indeed a must see for all fans of Chinese martial arts movies.",8,1,2,25 May 2009
Clash of the Titans," An Emotionally Hollow Remake
","I confess I watched the original 1981 film again recently in preparation for watching this remake. There was not any way for me to watch this new movie without making comparisons with the earlier movie. By the way, I only watched the 2D version.I can safely say that this new movie did not really make a significant improvement on the original film. Yes, the two movies are both have Perseus as the main hero. Some details from the first movie still appear, like Pegasus, the Stygian witches, Medusa and the Kraken. Even the wretched mechanical owl Bubo makes an appearance, thankfully in only a short cameo.Harry Hamlin is not really that much of an actor. But vis-a vis Sam Worthington, Hamlin is an Oscar winner! First of all, Worthington looks terribly out of place there, having not a shred of Greek appearance in him at all. And more importantly, he had very weak charisma as the hero of this epic. And with him, the whole enterprise simply collapses.It did not help that Perseus' all-important love affair with Andromeda is NOT even part of this new film! This gave the whole movie the totally different direction and perspective, opposite from what was originally in the myths which were supposed to have inspired it. The origins of Calibos and the scorpions were also changed, though not necessarily for the better. And, where on earth did the character of Perseus' guardian angel Io come from? That said, the actress who played Io (the beautiful Gemma Arterton) is, for me, the best part of the new movie.Now how about the special effects? Yes, Ray Harryhausen's stop motion animation in the first movie already looks dated. But still, the Medusa sequence in the first movie remains superior than the very artificial, CG version here. The very palpable suspense, tension and scare factor of the original was NOT present in this new version. I must say though that the Pegasus special effects of this new movie, especially the flying scenes, were beautifully done. Too bad its role was lazily shoehorned in so conveniently and illogically.Overall, I am disappointed in the way the script was written and the way the whole thing was acted out and executed by the director. For an action movie, yes, it was OK. However, there are expectations when it is an epic mythical story that is being told. There had been too much concentration on the special effects extravaganza, such that a lot of the all-important story was lost in the adrenaline rush. The whole film did not really work too well for me.",4,3,8,13 April 2010
Jurassic World," Badass Chris Pratt and Dinos!
","In 1993, we were all awed by the first 'Jurassic Park' film by Steven Spielberg. We remember that moment when our jaws dropped when we saw that first Brachiosaurus appear on screen. We definitely felt the fearsome terror of the T-Rex and the Velociraptors as they went on their rampages. Everything looked and felt so real, fully deserving of all the technical awards it won. Now, 22 years later, 'Jurassic World' brings us back to Isla Nublar where it all began. John Hammond's vision is now a very popular theme park, with interactive rides and activities with the dinosaurs. Claire Dearing is the park's uptight all-business operations manager. She is having a particularly hectic day when her nephews Zach (Nick Robinson) and Gray (Ty Simpkins) arrive for a visit. Serious problems arise concerning the park's latest, largest and most vicious hybrid creation, the Indominus Rex. Claire calls on Owen Grady, the park's onsite Velociraptor trainer, to save the day.Despite the existence of 'sequels' 'Jurassic Park: The Lost World' (1997) and 'Jurassic Park III' (2001), 'Jurassic World' is THE true sequel to the first 'Jurassic Park.' It is set in the same Costa Rican island where the first film was set. We see numerous references about the first film here as characters stumble into the ruins of the original resort in this film. We still see Dr. Henry Wu (B.D.Wong), the park's chief geneticist, the only human character from the first film in this one. And of course, there is the T-Rex.Now under the ownership of Simon Masrani (Irrfan Khan), the dinosaurs of the park have become mere commercial assets of a big business. The initial scenes show us the shallowness of what the park has become: kids riding baby Triceratops in a petting farm, boating and safariing among the plant-eaters, watching the gigantic Mosasaurus performs like a dolphin in a pool. The stuffy Claire, in her stiff hairdo, designer outfit and stilettos, represents this cold corporate philosophy. It is this philosophy of wanting to be constantly ahead that led to the ill-advised splicing of the DNA of various dinosaurs and other species creating the ultimate high-IQ killing monster, which would later be the park's own undoing. Practically all the adult human characters in this film are unlikable: greedy, petty, heartless.Lead star Chris Pratt plays probably the only likable character in this film. His Owen is the only one we all rooted for as he badass-ly led his posse of Velociraptors on a motorbike. He basically plays his charming 'Guardians of the Galaxy' character, but a smarter, less goofy, no- nonsense version. That her high heels get more attention than her acting does not speak too well of Bryce Dallas Howard's annoying performance as Claire. I guess her character was really supposed to be annoying so she is probably doing it right, yet she was blandly uncharismatic as a leading lady. The original timeless theme music by John Williams effectively evokes a sense of nostalgia as it gets played. The story telling by Steven Spielberg in the 1993 original though, remained superior over this one by newcomer Colin Trevorrow, riddled with some illogical close calls and questionable dinosaur psychology. The brotherly bonding between Zach and Grey was used as an emotional core, but it did get a bit too unrealistically sweet in the end (predictably so). Owen and Claire's love affair did not really seem to be necessary, yet they also put that in for some romance angle. The ethical and political issues about genetic bioengineering are touched on once again, just as the first did, with a bit less sting this time.Overall, the main highlight are still the dinosaurs. The awe we felt during the first film cannot be replicated, but the thrill is still there. Every time a giant meat-eater approaches a human character, the fearful tension created is heart-pounding, as it was before. The visual effects are first rate as ever, made even more realistic by updated technology, as are the sound effects that accompany the action. We all felt we were those kids riding that cool glass gyrosphere gazing up in wonder as the vestiges of a lost world roamed around us. 7/10.",7,3,10,10 June 2015
Paranormal Activity," Ruined by the Hype
","This is the typical example of a movie wherein too much hype actually ruins the watcher's movie experience. So much fuss had been raised about the excellent word of mouth, and how it propelled this movie to top the US movie charts during the Halloween season. Some reviews even called it the best horror movie out there. Of course, with all these in mind, we go in with very high expectations, hoping to be scared out our seats.Unfortunately, I have to disagree with the hype given this movie. There was no real horror in this very roughly-made film. The concept was like 'The Blair Witch Project.' Boyfriend Micah uses a hand-held camera to track the ghost that is haunting his live-in girlfriend Katie as they sleep. Good thing was it wasn't as dizzying than 'Blair Witch' (a movie that I could not keep my eyes on in its last half hour to vertigo from trying to watch it). But bad thing is, like 'Blair Witch,' it was much ado about nothing at all.All those daytime scenes only show the couple discussing or arguing about what happened the night before. In short, definitely fast-forward-able. In those night scenes, you literally watch the clock tick while waiting something scary to happen. These may give an uneasy feeling but not all those waiting times were so rewarded with something substantial. Several events (some actually quite interesting) do not really lead to anything.I think this movie would be best watched alone, in the house, in the dark, unhurried (the best conditions). Only then can this movie effectively deliver its goods. It is all about proper atmosphere and attitude while watching which will make this movie work.",2,6,11,23 November 2009
The Adjustment Bureau," A Film that Goes Beyond Shallow Entertainment
","This was a movie that I watched without any preconceived notions about it. I thought at first that it was a political film as Congressman David Norris (Matt Damon) was on his campaign to be the youngest Senator of New York. Then I thought it was a romantic film when Norris meets a charming mysterious girl in a men's restroom (Emily Blunt), and gets hit with love at first sight. However, the script makes another turn and introduces us to the agents of the Adjustment Bureau, whose job is to make sure the lives of each person goes according to the Chairman's plans. Whoa, there is a supernatural dimension to this movie, as well! I felt the movie was very interesting. You will get into the flow of the story and be very entertained. A big part of its connection with the audience are the very appealing performances of both Matt Damon and Emily Blunt as the star-crossed lovers, David and Elise. Their chemistry was charming and electric! Despite how the story was going, you will want to root for the two of them. I must admit you will have an inkling how everything would end up, but still you will want to follow the story up to the very end to see how it goes. The special effects of the case books and the opening doors add to the thrill of watching.At the end of the movie though, you will be thinking about your own life, religion and fate. The 'Chairman' is a none-too-subtle reference to God. There is God's will and Man's will. The movie suggests that man can get around God's will when he intently wants to make it happen. As Catholics, we believe we should leave our life all up to God's will. 'Your will be done, not mine.' Therefore, when personal religious beliefs come in, a film like this can go beyond shallow entertainment. I enjoyed watching 'The Adjustment Bureau' as a suspenseful love story, although I may not necessarily subscribe to its inherent philosophical premise.",7,1,2,14 March 2011
The Hangover Part II," Essentially an Unsatisfactory Remake of the First Movie
","I really enjoyed the first Hangover when it brought some fresh and frank elements into movie comedies two years ago. I was really excited to see this Part 2 as well. Somehow though, there was something missing in this strangely lifeless sequel.It is basically a remake of the first movie. This time it is Stu's wedding. Instead of Vegas, they are in Bangkok. But similarly, they get seriously drunk a couple of days before the wedding and wake up with unexplained consequences of what happened the night before. They have to figure out what happened to Teddy, Stu's prodigious teenage brother- in-law to be, before they can go back to the wedding. Can they find Teddy and make it back?If you have seen the first Hangover, you would know the answer to that question. The story structure is EXACTLY the same. However, I did not find the story too funny this time. Even the wisecracks of Alan (Zach Galfianakis) which were hilarious in the first movie, felt forced and even annoying in this one. The repeated cursing and the graphic naked scenes did not really help breathe life to the struggling comedy. By the time an off-key surprise cameo appearance comes out at the end, you don't really care. I don't think there should be a third one anymore.",5,2,4,10 June 2011
Prisoners," Wolverine in a Domestic Crime Drama
","The less you know about the story of this film, the better. I went into the theater not knowing anything about 'Prisoners' except for the names of its lead actors. I will not give you a synopsis so you can still watch the film without knowing the full story.'Prisoners' attempts to transform a story about a neighborhood kidnapping into something more than just a crime film. When a member of your family becomes a victim of a crime, you will be imprisoned in your own sense of justice. It becomes a thought-provoking film which makes you question your own sense of morality.The atmosphere created by Director Denis Villeneuve is dark and heavy from the first frame, as Hugh Jackman intones the Lord's Prayer. The cold November rainy weather sets the mood very well. However, two and half hours of a relentlessly downcast mood can take its toll on the audiences. I did feel that the film lost its bearings somehow when scalding showers and snakes entered the scene.Whatever missteps of the story and direction is made up for by the talented actors who try their best to bring this turgid story to life. It becomes a compelling drama, better than what it may have appeared on paper. The stellar Oscar-caliber stars bring their A-game to this.Hugh Jackman is explosive here as Keller Dover, the parent with the more extreme reaction to the crime against his family. He is clearly in Wolverine mode here as he gets caught up in his own warped vigilantism. He goes over-the-top in a lot of disturbing scenes, but it was that quiet moment when he recognizes a bloody item of clothing that was his best scene.Jake Gyllenhaal does very well as the dedicated officer in charge of the case, with a name as unlikely as Detective Loki. His best scene is when he was driving through the freeway in the pouring rain with a bleeding wound on his head further distorting his vision, rushing to bring a dying person to the hospital.Maria Bello plays Keller's unstable wife, trapped by her own addiction to sleeping pills. I do not like her past work, but here she was actually good despite her irritating character. Terrence Howard and Viola Davis play the Birches, close friends of the Dovers. They are generally calm people but circumstances force them to turn a blind eye and even become accomplices to another crime.Paul Dano plays a mentally-challenged guy named Alex Jones. He somehow gets us to feel for his creepy character. Melissa Leo plays his adoptive mother Holly. Their behavior will keep you guessing as to their involvement in the case on hand.Overall, this can be a very compelling film that will keep you guessing. However, this is a lengthy, deliberately slow paced film. Despite its good intentions, I feel that it could have been edited into something less meandering and repetitive. A film like this dragged too long is bound to give rise to questionable plot devices and bad red herrings, and this one unfortunately has both.",6,2,4,26 September 2013
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Superhero Saturation?
","The first Avengers film was an awesome film. It lived up to all expectations, and fans filed out of the cinema generally very happy and excited about the superhero extravaganza they had just seen. This sequel therefore had a much bigger fan expectations to fulfill. Now that the novelty of having all these heroes together has already passed, it now depends on a great story to pull this second installment through. My verdict is that while it is still a larger-than-life, visually- impressive action film, it did not exactly inspire the same level of adulation that the first one so handily developed. The adventure starts in a fictional European country of Sokovia where the Avengers were attacking the Hydra lair to retrieve Loki's scepter. The blue stone in that scepter contain powerful artificial intelligence technology which Tony Stark and Bruce Banner uses to create Ultron, the ultimate peace-keeper for the world. Ironically however, Ultron believes that humanity needs to be eradicated in order to achieve peace. Ultron recruits the powerful Maximoff twins, super-speedy Pietro and telepathic Wanda, who have an axe to grind against Tony Stark. The action reaches a peak back in Sokovia where Ultron develops a machine to lift a huge segment of the city up to the sky with the intent of dropping it down to cause global annihilation. Together with new allies they pick up along the way, the Avengers have to regroup and gather their forces together in order to foil Ultron's twisted quest for human extinction.While the requisite bad-ass fight scenes and humorous zingers are still there, but there was something I can't exactly put my finger on that affected my enjoyment of the film overall. Maybe it was the sheer number of characters we need to focus on so the storytelling can be messy at points. Every character had their own personal issues to address, such that some parts of the film tended to lag down. Maybe it was how Thor seemingly became the unexpected comic relief for the film. Maybe it was how I was not used to seeing Natasha as a hopeless romantic or as a damsel in distress. I don't know, I enjoyed the film for sure, but there was just something amiss somewhere.I did like the part where we see Clint Barton's home and meet his family. We get to see the super-archer in a much different light and these scenes gave Jeremy Renner his moment to shine after being underused in the first film. Strangely for a film with so many characters, Hawkeye is the ONLY one in whom you can connect emotionally.I liked the new characters this film introduced to us. The Scarlet Witch (played by Elizabeth Olsen) is a very powerful heroine with awesome abilities. It should be interesting how her character will develop future films. The scenes building up to the birth of Vision are positively sublime -- so well done! Paul Bettany transitioned from being the voice of JARVIS to his personification as Vision very fluidly. The main antagonist Ultron was voiced with buttery calm by James Spader. I admit I felt there was some disconnect between the coolness of the voice with the expectation of pure nefariousness for this villain. There was a short extra scene in the middle of the end credits featuring an Infinity Gauntlet and one character whom we last saw in 'Guardians of the Galaxy'. I thought I would see more though. And no, to the disappointment of fans who patiently waited, there was no second extra scene at the very end of the credits. There was only the promise that 'The Avengers will return'. That return is reportedly going to be in May 2018.Overall, this is still one big bang of a film. Those dynamically blocked and executed sequences where all the Avengers were fighting side-by-side were a joy to watch. Writer-director Joss Whedon tried his best to weave together a fan-friendly, action-filled film with more than 10 superheroes, yet still managing to maintain some sort of story coherence, while connecting to past and future Marvel films revolving around this universe. But I think the decision to relinquish the directorial reins of the next Avengers films to the Russo Brothers (who did an excellent job in 'Captain America:The Winter Soldier') may be a good idea in order to inject some fresher ideas before more signs of franchise fatigue start to show. 8/10.",8,5,14,24 April 2015
The Dark Knight," Very vital, arresting and award-worthy
","This is a very serious movie. The audience forgets that story is based on classic comic book characters, DC Comics at that. I felt the same vibe as when I saw 'The Departed' before. This is a classic gangster movie at its very core.The director Christopher Nolan was obviously aiming for so much more than the run of the mill hero flick. The epic length of this latest Batman film is proof of his lofty ambitions. The main actors felt that passion, and all gave inspired performances.Overall, this is so far the most accomplished film is wide release this year. The exciting and violent action begin right off with a bold bank heist to assassinations until the final face-off between Batman and his arch-enemy. (Those scenes on the Bat-Cycle were all so adrenalized and extreme!) The script, the camera-work, the editing and the music all fell in to the right synch to create an action masterpiece destined to be a classic in its genre.Compared with the previous 'Batman Begins', Christian Bale gave way to his co-stars in this one. The acting of Gary Oldman (as Commissioner Gordon) Aaron Eckhart (as Harvey Dent) and the late Heath Ledger (as The Joker) are all very vital, arresting and award-worthy. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine attack their respective roles with their usual efficiency.Of course, The Joker IS the more eye-catching role. Heath plays him as a seriously demented psychopathic sociopath, as The Joker had never been portrayed before. He exudes menace and dread every time he is on screen. The creepy smudged make up completes a most unforgettably evil movie villain, much like Anton Chigurh (from 'No Country For Old Men') the year before.PS: Minor squibble: They could have done better in the casting of Rachel Dawes. The last time, Katie Holmes was a certainly prettier but rather frivolous choice. Maggie Gyllenhall in this one I felt was miscast. A better actress for sure, but the look did not fit for me.",9,2,6,24 July 2008
Everest," A Glorious and Grim Adventure
","This film tells the true story of a group of men who dared to climb to the peak, braving a harsh environment physiologically-incompatible with human life. Bob Cotter ran Adventures Consultants, a service to guide climbers willing to shell out $75,000 up to the Everest summit. His support staff includes base camp manager Helen Wilton, medic Dr. Caroline Mackenzie, along with a number of expert climbers and native sherpas for guides. For the fateful climb on May 10, 1976, we follow expedition group leader Rob Hall and his group composed of doctor Beck Weathers, mailman Doug Hansen, journalist Jon Krakauer (who eventually wrote the book about this climb), female Japanese veteran climber Yasuko Namba and others. Before their big climb on May 10, they first had a month-long training camp on the lower levels of the mountain in order to acclimatize their bodies to the inhospitable conditions. While the group was up the mountain though, a deadly blizzard descends upon the mountain, placing all the men on the mountain in extreme peril.Jason Clarke radiated a lot of warmth as compassionate New Zealander expedition group leader Rob Hall. His conversations with his pregnant wife Jan (played by Keira Knightley in a brief yet remarkable supporting performance) were touching and heartbreaking. Josh Brolin was loud and arrogant as the wealthy Texan climber Beck. John Hawkes was perfectly self-effacing as Doug, a poor working man whose climb was partially sponsored by school children. Despite his prominent billing, Jake Gyllenhaal plays only a small role as an unconventional surfer-type rival guide. As in his previous films, Sam Worthington was not really very memorable as Bob Cotter. Emily Watson was motherly as the distressed manager Helen. I am partial to mountain adventures more than the beach. Based on my limited number of hikes up mountains like Pinatubo or Diamondhead, reaching the peak gives such a victorious feeling of exhilaration and accomplishment. Knowing my limitations as a climber, I know that climbing even a segment of Everest is but an impossible pipe dream. That is why I liked this movie a lot. With its spectacular cinematography, this film brought me up to the summit of Everest in such a realistic, involving way. The places on the majestic mountain which I never would have even dreamed of seeing, like the Base Camp (17,000 ft), the Balcony (27,390 ft) or the Hillary Step (28,740 ft), were right there in front of my eyes! We see everything along their snowy way -- those elegant yaks, those serene Buddhist monks, all the way up to the legendary peak with the little flags summiteers have planted their as a sign of their successful conquest. We will also see the various faces of the human spirit when challenged by the elements -- from triumph, valor and brotherhood to despair, defeat and resignation. Thankfully, the very real dangers of the climb, like the wide crevasses to be crossed on rickety ladders, the icy wind burning the skin off your face, the nasty frostbite that could cost you to lose frozen body parts, or the avalanches that can rumble down on you at anytime, are to be experienced from the safety of your theater seats. The parts of the film when the characters were just making their way up the mountain and training for the big climb may be slow for certain audience members. You will learn a lot about the medical aspect of climbing up to an oxygen-poor altitude such as that of Everest. For me, I vicariously immersed myself in that literally breathtaking climbing experience which for certain I will never have myself. Man, in his quest to prove that he the master of this world, has this unquenchable desire to conquer the earth's highest peak -- Mt. Everest. However in climbing Everest, the last word, as the film tells us, always belonged to the mountain. 8/10.",8,3,6,17 September 2015
Friends with Benefits," Fornication is NOT cool
","I was very intrigued with Mila Kunis since I saw her in 'Black Swan.' Her portrayal of the new ballet dancer that threatened Natalie Portman was spot-on and riveting. I knew I would like to see her again in other films. And so, even as romantic comedies are not exactly my cup of tea, I watched 'Friends with Benefits.'The movie started very well with Jamie (Mila Kunis) and Dylan (Justin Timberlake) breaking up with their respective SO's. That paved the way for big-time blogger Dylan to meet professional head-hunter Jamie in New York City so she can convince him to accept a job as an editor in GQ Magazine. The situation devolves from a nice smart friendship into an unconscionable purely sexual relationship. Of course, the rest of the film goes as the typical rom-com formula goes: boy meets girl, they fight and separate, then they get back together.While Mila Kunis is so attractive and bubbly in her portrayal of Jamie, I was disappointed to see her in this kind of loose character. Still, Mia Kunis is the best part of this movie. I am a fan of this girl. On the other hand, Justin Timberlake seems to be playing the same type of guy in all his films. The Justin here seems to be the same cocky, fast- talking, sleazy Justin in the Facebook movie!This film has got some remarkable supporting characters which divert our attention. Richard Jenkins as Dylan's dad with Alzheimer's was good, but seems out of place in this story. Jenna Elfman as Dylan's understanding sister was sweet. Patricia Clarkson as Jamie's hippy liberated mother was funny. Woody Harrelson as GQ's Sports Editor was hilarious in his few scenes.For me, only the snappy dialogs and the perkiness of Mila Kunis save this movie. While I know that this type of 'sex-only' arrangement exists in these hedonistic times, I do not particularly like to see this immoral situation 'glamorized' on screen. Fornication is NOT cool.",4,1,2,3 October 2011
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Way Better than the Book!!!
","I watched this IMAX version this morning and it was well worth the expense. This is one of those rare times where the movie is WAY BETTER than the book! The Order of the Phoenix is my least favorite of the six published books so far. The adventures were repetitive of previous books. I felt that nothing original was introduced. I also felt that it was not well-written since the action is not clearly described. When I finished the book, I did not feel any sense of awe that I felt especially with the fantastic 4th (Goblet of Fire) and 6th (Half Blood Prince) books! But this film was the total opposite. After sitting through disappointing film interpretations of the 3rd (Prisoner of Azkaban) and 4th books, this movie is a vast improvement over the book. I guess I have to credit the writer for distilling the ponderous text into this coherent and action-packed adventure script. And the director, David Yates, who is relative newcomer, who created an amazing vision from the lackluster printed words. The story is easy to follow, and logically sequenced. The action scenes are very well choreographed and executed on the big screen.The IMAX version features 3D rendition of the last 20 minutes of this 2 hour 20 minute film. This was from the scene where the gang flies off to London to fight Voldemort on flying beasts, through their dangerous magical adventures in the Ministry of Magic. The 3D effects of the flying around, the perspectives of the doorways and corridors within the building, the destruction made by the violent spells being thrown around were nothing short of amazing and impressive.The three main kids have really grown up. Daniel Radcliffe really turned out to be the perfect actor for Harry. He grew up well with the series, and can indeed carry off the heroics and angst of the title character. Emma Watson (Hermione) and Rupert Grint (Ron)have less screen time here, but they also did their job well. The chose well for the actress (Evanna Lynch) to play Luna Lovegood, who is quite annoying in the book, but very well portrayed in this movie. Those small clues regarding Ginny Weasley were also excellently hinted in many scenes, and very well underplayed by Bonnie Wright.The esteemed senior members of the class do their best with their limited screen time, such as Gary Oldman, Robbie Coltrane, Emma Thompson (so good as Sibyl Trelawney!) and Maggie Smith. I still miss Richard Harris as Dumbledore. There is something amiss in Michael Gambon's performance in my opinion.Their nemesis in this installment is Dolores Umbridge played so sinisterly by Imelda Staunton. I have only heard of this actress from 'Vera Drake.' She is so good at being so hateful! She interpreted this villain as I imagined as she was described in the book. With a shorter villain role is Helena Bonham Carter as the mad Deatheater, Bellatrix Lestrange.Overall, an excellent film!!!",9,1,4,12 July 2007
Puss in Boots," Weird Mishmash of Fairy Tales but Very Funny in Spots
","When we first saw the trailer for Puss in Boots, I can't say I was really excited to see it. But of course, the kids wanted to see it so we did (in 2D only). I must say, we all had a mighty good time! No regrets at all in watching this animated fantasy-Western adventure.We see Puss' humble origins as a kitten growing up in an orphanage in the Mexican town of San Ricardo. He develops an unlikely friend in one odd egg named Humpty Alexander Dumpty. Circumstances eventually break up the two friends. After several years, Humpty seeks out Puss (with the help of sultry seductress Kitty Softpaws) to convince him to help get Jack's magic beans from Jack and Jill. I know this sounds like a messy mishmash of fairy tale characters, and it was. The artists also take liberties in their visual interpretation of these characters, including the Golden Goose (which I personally found corny).Thanks to the Shrek films, we already know Puss in Boots and what to expect from him. His Zorro-like swashbuckling exploits, his charm with the ladies and his cute wide-eyed pleading look are all here, and Antonio Banderas too! Selma Hayek voices Kitty delightfully. This new character is quite likable, and you would like to see more adventures of the two cats. As for Humpty (voiced by Zach Galifianakis of 'Hangover' fame) though, here lies the prickly problem. You may or may not like him, both his look and his character. Humpty can really be annoying!There are so many hilarious isolated situations that could make you laugh out loud. I certainly did at several points. My favorite funny moment was that when Humpty changed into his Golden Egg costume. I'm sure you can get an absurd image just by reading that last sentence. Haha! His line when he was running and commented that he needed powder to prevent friction in his pants (he was apparently not wearing underwear) really made me guffaw! You have to hear it to believe that a line like that made it into a children's cartoon flick.The artwork was of course flawless. The textures are palpable. The action sequences are exciting and funny at the same time. The fight scenes mixed with dance moves were quite interesting to watch as well. The 2D version looked adequate enough to enjoy the adventure. Overall this is a fun movie to watch with the whole family.",6,4,8,31 October 2011
Elysium," The Gap Between Rich and Poor
","In the world of 'Elysium' set a century hence, the ever-widening gap between rich and poor has reached its ultimate level. The rich are now floating above the earth in a utopia set-up in space. The poor remain to suffer on the squalid wasteland that remains on Earth.Max Da Costa (Matt Damon) is a laborer who was stricken with severe radiation illness in a work accident. His only chance to recover is via the healing facilities located up there in Elysium, exclusive for the use of Elysium citizens. Max seeks help from renegade hacker Spider (Wagner Moura) to smuggle him across. Max was provided with an android- like exoskeleton (which gave him superhuman strength) and a cerebral link (to steal vital Elysium information). However, the powers-that-be represented by the fanatical Secretary of Defense Jessica Delacourt (Jodie Foster) makes sure the impossible immigration laws are strictly enforced and their floating space station remains pure. She has her sociopathic enforcer Kruger (a frequently unintelligible Sharlto Copley) on Earth to make sure no 'undesirables' ever crosses over the line, and that includes Max. The social message is very clear in this film, criticizing the great financial divide and its diabolical implications, especially with regards to health care. Director Neil Blomkamp previously tackled racial discrimination in his acclaimed previous film 'District 9' which made it all the way to the Oscar Best Picture shortlist a few years back.Despite the presence of bigger stars, 'Elysium' is not exactly better than 'District 9'. While intentions of the story are obviously noble, the execution of this story was rather roughshod, as rough as the dizzying shaky camera technique employed (unnecessarily, I thought) in most of this film. The best part of the film was Matt Damon, who managed to remain believable as the flawed hero Max, even if the circumstances of his story became unbelievable. On the other hand, the usually cerebral Ms. Jodie Foster actually comes up with an over-the-top one-dimensional performance here, which did not fit her well. Being a science fiction film, we expect to be regaled with special effects, but here, we were shown nothing we have not seen before. Of all the futuristic equipment shown, it was the powerful healing machine Med-Bay which was the most impressive. It was able to perform a total face reconstruction in minutes complete with nicely trimmed beard! One really head-scratching moment was the 'surgery' of the sick Max in the hands of rebels to receive sophisticated technical gadgets attached not only to his body (through his t-shirt, mind you) but also his brain. You really need to suspend your disbelief big time how that could have been done, given the crude conditions Max and his 'neurosurgeons' were in. Overall, I would just rate this film a little above average. The ending scenario though was very good despite the rocky road the film took to get there. The initial premise was very promising, more could have been done with it. For instance, we don't see enough of what life on Elysium was really about. It was not a bad film, but just a bit disappointing given its potential.",6,0,1,3 September 2013
Taken," The Most Straight to the Point Movie I've Ever Seen
","Stranded in the office because of storm-related flooding, I watched this movie to pass the time. And my, that time went by so fast with this film! Liam Neeson plays Bryan, a divorced, down-and-out retired spy who hankers to get closer with his daughter, Kim. Daughter goes to Paris one day but gets abducted by a white slavery gang on her first day there. But fortunately, she just so happened to be on the phone with her dad when she got abducted. So super-spy dad figures everything out from the little he had recorded on his phone, goes to Paris, infiltrates the Albanian gang and rescues his daughter after she has been sold off at a flesh auction. This was all told within an hour and a half of exciting movie story-telling.Director Pierre Morel does very well in his first English language feature, after being more well known as a cinematographer in France. It is written by prominent French writer/director Luc Besson. They don't waste time on unnecessary details. Of course, you need to suspend your disbelief as Bryan methodically executes his perfect plans with nary a hitch, and the impossible became a reality.It was a good action thriller. The family drama interspersed with the action does not fail to give it some heart. This film goes straight to the point. There is not a moment of screen time or your time wasted.",7,1,2,29 September 2009
Avatar," Welcome Back the King of the World (and Other Worlds)
","James Cameron had not directed any movie since being the 'King of the World' after 'Titanic' in 1998. This big movie 'Avatar' is certainly more than an worthy comeback project to again re-launch Mr. Cameron back into filmdom's firmament.When I first saw the trailer some months ago, I admit that I was not entirely enticed to catch this film. Lately though, the film had been garnering nominations and wins for Best Picture in some year-end award giving bodies, including the Golden Globes. And finally, I was lucky enough to win two free tickets to a special invitational 3D screening tonight, so there was no question that I would watch this. And wow, I am sure glad that I did.Truth to tell, the basic story is not entirely new as we have seen it in various incarnations in so many previous movies. However, the grand imaginative vision of Mr. James Cameron is what elevated this piece into the masterpiece that it is. We are effectively transported to a whole new time (in the 22nd century) and planet (called Pandora), with plant and animal life the likes of which we have never seen before.The magical effect of 3D was put to good effect in the whole movie. From the amazingly big battle scenes to quiet scenes, the 3D drew us into this alien place as more than a mere spectator. I found it hard to imagine watching this film in regular 2D. The extra money you would pay to enjoy the 3D is very much worth it.The acting of the humans and the aliens were all very good. Clearly standing out are the good guys led by Sam Worthington (very convincing as both the crippled Marine Jake Sully and his alien Avatar) and Sigourney Weaver (as his mentor and leader of the Avatar project, Dr. Grace Augustine). On the alien side, female characters like Zoe Saldana's Neytiri and CCH Pounder's Moat stand out. The bad guys were a bit on the cardboard side, one dimensional in their wanton greed and evil machinations.This film is definitely a front-runner in the award season in the next few months. It is clearly the leader in the field of Visual Effects. Cameron reportedly conceived this project back in 1994, but only pushed through now when the technology to realize his vision had been developed, and how! We the audience are also effectively drawn into the heart that beats within the story, and get caught up in the adrenaline rush of the action along the way. This is told as only James Cameron can. Indeed, he is back!",10,40,66,17 December 2009
Drag Me to Hell," Perfect Blend of Horror and Comedy
","'Drag Me To Hell' is the latest opus of Spiderman director Sam Raimi. He also wrote this screenplay. I know that Sam Raimi is a skilled horror director by reputation, but I admit that I have not yet seen his Evil Dead series. We get glimpses of this talent particularly in Spiderman 2 where there is an overextended scene in the operating room with chainsaws. I made sure that I saw this film on the big screen.The story is about a mousy loan officer of a small town bank named Christine Brown. In her desperate effort to impress her boss to gain a promotion, she decided to stand firm and reject an extension to the loan of an old Gypsy woman named Mrs. Ganush. Of course, you know she made a big mistake in crossing and shaming this woman in public. From that day on, we witness her world turn into a veritable living hell. Furthermore, the curse inflicted on her also included the threat that her soul will be dragged into the fires of actual Hell within three days.This whole film was a very wild ride. It was done with tongue fully in cheek. It is preposterous and over-the-top, but you know it was done on purpose. The first fight encounter between Christine and Mrs. Ganush in the car sets the incredulous pace for the scares to come. Just sit back and enjoy the relentless tension, the jump-out-of-your-seat scares, the loud yet effectively scary cacophony of the musical score and sound effects, the disgusting overflow of bodily fluids, etc...The main reason for the success of this film lies on the antagonist, rather than the protagonist. Mrs. Ganush is certainly one of the most memorable cinematic ghouls since Sadako! Her decayed teeth (actually dentures), her sharp fingernails, her damaged eyes and her wizened face will surely haunt many a viewer's nightmares. Lorna Raver should be commended for her gruesome performance! My main beef was I do not really like Alison Lohman who played Christine Brown. I did not think she was a very good actress. In fact, her small-girl voice in those lame radio ads almost dissuaded me to watch this. I felt she actually dragged my rating down a bit due to her dismal acting in the lead role, no less.Overall, I will recommend this film to lovers of horror flicks. This is a notch above the run of the mill screamfests. You will get jumpy. You will cover your eyes. You will cringe. You will cower. You will laugh nervously. Don't take this film experience too seriously because this movie isn't really supposed to be that way. You will be captivated up to (literally) the very last scene.",8,0,3,4 June 2009
The Artist," Very Charming Stars, but Don't Expect Too Much from the Story
","'The Artist' is the odds on favorite now to get the Oscar Best Picture crown, since it had just won the Producers' Guild nod. Everything about it will make you think twice before watching it. It is a SILENT film, in BLACK AND WHITE, with unknown FRENCH actors. Thanks to the awards hype it is getting though, audiences will search this out, as did I.The story is not the biggest selling point of the film. It is silent, so there can only be so much that can be told by facial expressions, big actions and the occasional dialog card. The story line is very simple, and very familiar, and can be summarized in one sentence: It is about a silent film star who will eventually be surpassed in the industry by the girl he helped get into films, just as silents gave way to talkies in the 1930s. If this same story was told in the current way, it would have been panned. So the novelty gimmick of director/writer Michel Hazanavicius worked in this case, but I do not think it will revive a trend for black & white silent films.The lead character George Valentin is played by Jean Dujandin. The starlet he helped launch Peppy Miller is played by Berenice Bejo. The lead actors were both very charming. They possess the facial qualities which convince us that they were indeed from that era of film. The debonair Dujardin, in particular, goes through the gamut of emotion without a word uttered until the very end. This will make him a prime candidate for Oscar's Best Actor, a prize he already won in Cannes. Much have been said about the character of Valentin's dog, played by Jack Russell terrier Uggie. He's cute alright, but to push him for Best Supporting Actor is a stretch.",8,3,7,24 January 2012
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," The Saga Ends As Cheesy As It Started
","I have just come home from watching this last installment of the Twilight Saga, Breaking Dawn Part 2 with my wife. I don't know what is with these Twilight movies that we look forward to watching them, simply to see how bad they are. Haha! The poster showing the three main characters running did not hold much promise of a better film.This film starts where the last film left off. Bella has just given birth to her daughter Renesmee. This supernatural birth brings Bella close to death, so Edward saves her by making her a vampire. Now, when the Volturri find out about Renesmee, they consider her a threat to their existence and hence seek to kill her. Will the Cullen family be able to protect Renesmee and themselves from ultimate destruction?The beginning of this movie are filled with the same clunky scenes and corny dialog that we have all seen and cringed to in all the previous movies. The very long scene showing Bella's reaction to Jacob's imprinting is particularly hilarious. There was also the requisite Jacob striptease scene strictly for Team Jacob fanatics.The climactic battle scenes between the Cullens and the Volturri were another matter though. Sure it was pure computer generated mayhem and violence. But for those who have not read the books and just followed the films, there was some imaginative storytelling at work here for a change. I am actually curious how this part of the story was written in the book. I will give this movie an extra point for this part.In the closing scenes set in the familiar field of purple flowers we have seen before, the whole Twilight saga ends with an incredibly thick serving of cheese. I am not surprised. It ends as it started: cheesy. It never really aspired to be more, so let the Twi-hard fans enjoy this last film while it lasts. So now that it all ends, I'm pretty sure the rest of the world will also be missing Bella and her two other-worldly consorts. We won't have a next film to look forward to nitpick anymore.",6,29,71,15 November 2012
Invictus," That Rousing Second Half is Well Worth the Long Wait
","Running for over two hours, this film really felt long especially at the beginning. You really need patience to watch this movie. The first 45 minutes about various political meetings was so boring I almost gave up! Not even Morgan Freeman's uncanny portrayal of Pres. Nelson Mandela was enough. Then came that scene where Mandela met up with Springboks Captain Francois Pienaar (played by Matt Damon) to encourage them to win the Rugby World Cup in order to promote unity for the newly united South Africa. Thankfully, after that scene, the movie finally woke up and picked up the pace, and became an entertaining film.As with any inspirational sports film like 'Mighty Ducks' or 'Rocky', you know how this would end. Yet I found the rugby scenes engrossing, even if I did not really understand all the mechanics of the game. I wish they had included more information about the game or had play-by-play of the matches for better appreciation of the action. That last match of the Springboks vs the New Zealand All Blacks was very exciting. I liked the details, like the plane that mysteriously flew above the stadium, and the Maori Haka dance of the All Blacks before the match began.As director, again Clint Eastwood had his excesses, as he did in his other flawed films like 'Flag of our Fathers' or 'Changeling'. He should have decided which film he wanted to make. The second half of the film could have stood on its own as a very good focused sports film. Too bad, Eastwood also delve lengthily on political issues in the beginning. Honestly, this movie succeeds more as an inspirational sports movie, than an inspirational political film. I must emphasize though, that rousing second half is well worth the wait.",6,1,3,9 January 2010
Mama," Visually Stunning and Emotionally Charged!
","'Mama' is the first big horror film release of the year, so as a horror movie fan, I really wanted to watch this. It has the name of Guillermo del Toro, not as director as I first thought, but as a producer, so we expected fantastic visuals. I was pleasantly surprised to see Jessica Chastain there too, looking like I have not seen her before, sporting a short dark Joan Jett-hairstyle. This film really had a lot going for it.'Mama' is a malevolent female spirit who jealously hounds the couple Annabelle (Jessica Chastain) and Luke (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) who adopts a couple of young girls who had been found living wildly in an abandoned cabin in the woods. Throughout this movie, in the way of disturbing dreams and jarring apparitions, we join Annabelle try to discover what exactly 'Mama' wants that she cannot seem to get. First-time feature film director Andrés Muschietti succeeds to create a horror film that was visually stunning as it was emotionally charged. The stylish look may have been influenced by the producer, Guillermo del Toro. The emotional ride was largely due to the restrained yet effective performance of Jessica Chastain as a single rocker-chick who was suddenly given the unexpected and unwelcome responsibility of being a step-mother to two very disturbed girls.The one drawback for me was 'Mama' herself, particularly how she looked. I admit I did not really like how she reminded me so much of Sadako (of the 'Ring' films) in all its obvious computer-generated glory. However, the camera angles used to show 'Mama' and her point of view were quite innovative. There were gaping plot holes when you think the story through and try to give explanations to 'Mama''s illogical behavior. But hey, she is a crazy ghost after all! Just sit back, imbibe the creepy atmosphere and feel the emotion in the story.",7,26,41,29 January 2013
Super 8," Perfectly Spielbergian
","'Super 8' is a very hyped-up movie. The trailer does not tell us much, just a train crash that a group of middle school kids witness. But truth to tell, the name of Steven Spielberg attached to this project still did a lot to bring the audience in. I was one of them. J.J. Abrams as the director also gives the film some pedigree.'Super 8' brings us back to the summer of1979. We follow a gang of kids who are finishing a zombie film for a short film competition. While shooting a scene at a train station one midnight, they witness a massive train crash. Following this event, strange goings-on like missing appliances and disappearing pets then people pervade their small town of Lilian, Ohio. Before they know it, the US Air Force comes in and evacuates the whole town. These events are seen in the eyes of these young teens.The central character is Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney). We share his excitement over his shared film project with his friends, where his role is make-up and models. We share his sadness over his mom's death and his alienation from his busy policeman father (Kyle Chandler). We share his puppy love with Alice (a very pretty and mature-looking Elle Fanning). His personal story was intertwined with the terrorization of his town by an unknown menace.This is not really a perfect film. The ending (which I found cheesy, overly sentimental but ultimately senseless, especially that locket scene)could in fact have been done much better. However, it is a perfectly Spielbergian film. We see him in the precocious children who play the lead characters. We see him in the passionate hobby of the kids. We see him in the alien monster. So many elements of 80's Spielberg can be seen in 'Super 8', now for a new generation of kids to identify with. As the main film faded out, I was thinking they should have shown the film that the kids were working on. Happily, they did! Stay on through the first half of the credits as you see the kids' ouevre, entitled 'The Case.'",7,3,8,12 June 2011
Sinister," It Is As It Is Entitled.
","I am usually disappointed when I see a film which came with very high expectations. However, I must make an exception to 'Sinister.' I had heard very good things about this film making it a must-see for a horror movie fan like me. However, I had to be out of the country during the days it was shown in the theaters locally last month, so I only got to watch it now. And these high expectations were fulfilled. 'Sinister' is indeed a very good horror film. In fact, I will go on to say that it was one of the best American horror films ever made.Ellison (Ethan Hawke in his first appearance in a horror film) is an author of true crime novels who is seeking to follow up his one hit book. He moves his family into the very home where a gruesome family massacre had previously taken place. When he discovers a box of film reels which turned out to be video footage documenting the deaths of several families, his research turns into a real life horror for him and his family.The eerie and tense atmosphere is set up from the very first scene where we see four people hanging from a tree. It never let up from there up to the bloody end. OK, there are horror clichés here like the house in seemingly perpetual darkness, or the sudden scares that lead nowhere, creepy children drawing on walls, and so on, but in this movie, these things actually work well to work up the audience's heart rates and goosebumps. The music is pulsating as it is unsettling, very effective to work you up some more with every step that Ellison takes in the house. I liked the way that the gore was suggested instead of blatant. I liked the subtlety of many of its scare moments. I liked the way that Ethan Hawke realistically portrayed the tormented but desperate Ellison. A male protagonist is not always as easy to play in a horror film than a female one. I like the ending, how it may seem that you can figure out what is going to happen in the end, but the way it played out was pretty out-of-the-box disturbing and ultimately, shocking. I highly recommend horror film fans to watch 'Sinister.' It is as it is entitled.",9,3,5,14 November 2012
3 Idiots," My Intro to Bollywood: Comedy, Musical, Melodrama in One
","I watched '3 Idiots' upon the recommendation of my cousin. I believe this is the first complete Bollywood film I have seen. '3 Idiots' is a film that goes from the present time, to flashbacks of the lead characters' college days in engineering school. Pals Raju (Sharman Joshi) and Fahran (Madhavan) are looking for their best friend Rancho (Aamir Khan) with whom they have lost contact since graduation. Amidst the juvenile school jokes and musical scenes in bathrooms, the story is sending a serious message that learning is more than just rote memorization. Life is about following your own dreams. It also tells us not to face life with fear, overly relying on religion and charms.There are so many over-the-top scenes in this film which runs more than 2 and a half hours! There was a long scene about a speech where the word 'served' was switched with something considerably more vulgar. Funny but went on too long. This may be funnier for people who speak Hindi than those of us who rely on translation. There was a very long scene about a storm, a brownout and someone giving birth. Dramatic but again overstretched and unbelievable. There was also an unexpected sequence about suicide that did not sit well with me in this supposed comedy.I personally liked the simpler poignant scenes that deliver a bigger punch, like the scene with the Prof. Virus and the pen, the scene with Fahran and his dad, the final revelation scene at the end. There were also some nice scenes with Rancho and the young doctor Pia about her fiancé who seemed to be more concerned about how expensive things were, than about her. '3 Idiots' is generally fun to watch, except when the jokes became too toilet or too mean for comfort. There was a lot of suspension of disbelief at the time sequences of a lot of what happened, sometimes not too logical. I could not believe that the actor who played Rancho, Aamir Khan, was actually already in his mid-40s, and yet there he was still credibly playing a college student. Overall though, I did enjoy this, my introduction to Bollywood film. Time to discover more about movies from this part of the world.",8,4,8,14 August 2011
Up," Excellent and Very Heartfelt Animated Film for All Ages
","When I saw the preview months ago, I knew this latest Pixar offering should really be seen in 3D for the best effect. However, upon watching, I feel that the best feature of this 5-star film is not really the 3D animation, it is the heart upon which the heartwarming story of Carl and Ellie Frederickson is so firmly based.From the trailer, I already knew this would not be the typical Disney-Pixar film. First of all, the lead character is a cantankerous elderly guy! I was really curious how this story would flow. And true to Pixar's amazing record of film-making, 'Up' belongs up there with the best of them.That wordless montage on the evolution of the relationship between Carl and his wife Ellie from childhood to old age was beautiful and very touching. Maybe kids will not get affected, but certainly adults will be hard-pressed to hold back their tears in these few minutes that start of the film.The 'spirit of adventure' upon which the love affair of Carl and Ellie was founded was finally realized when Carl was pushed to the wall by modern developments around their house. Carl had no other recourse but to go for broke and bring their house to the edge of Paradise Falls in Venezuela, as Ellie always dreamed since her childhood. He did this in the most original way, only possible in an animated film like this.The relationships Carl builds with his unwitting stowaway boy scout Russell, and later the strange bird Kevin and talking dog Doug, were slow to build up. But again, in true Pixar fashion, the power of true friendships shines through adversities encountered. Great story-telling indeed. This is a movie truly for all ages to enjoy. Do not miss it! The 3D is not essential for you to fall in love with it.",10,1,3,30 August 2009
How to Train Your Dragon," Do Not Let the Trailer Discourage You. This is Very Good!
","The trailer of this movie was so unpromising and unattractive. It did not make me want to watch this, in 3D no less. However, my kids all wanted to watch it, so of course, my wife and I had to go with them.The first one-fourth of the movie was very static and slow for me, all talk. I felt very sleepy and was in fact, drifting off. I did not really immediately like the appearance of the kids, which I found generally annoying. However, when time came that our hero (with the improbable name of Hiccup) met his cute dragon pal (with the equally improbable name of Toothless), the movie picked up pace and from there, it never looked back.The next three fourths of the film was alive with beautiful 3D animation and very heartfelt and touching writing. I know we have all seen flying dragons before (like in 'Shrek'), but the additional animated depth and the fantastic background scenery gave this one a breath-taking quality that made it distinct. The very meticulous and larger-than life scenes of the Viking armada at sea, the Vikings running from the exploding mountain, and especially the final climactic battle, were truly in a class of their own. That is saying a lot in these times when 3D animation seems to be the standard already, and not the exception.The story of the rough tough father and his weakling son has been played in out in various ways in so many various movies before. But somehow, the way it is played out here still managed to be effective in drawing out genuine emotions. The straightforward storyline and familiar conflicts were successfully brought to a higher level by the original vision and masterful direction of Dean de Blois and Chris Sanders (of 'Lilo and Stitch'). This is a shoo-in for one of the nominee slots in the Best Animated Feature Oscar for the coming year.",10,10,22,21 March 2010
Limitless," Fascinating Premise, Unsatisfactory Ending
","Eddie Morro is a down-and-out writer. He can't write a single word to start his book. His girlfriend has left him. One day, his drug-dealing ex-brother-in-law lets him in on a clear little tablet he called NZT. When Eddie takes this tablet, his mind miraculously starts to work at a level he had never known before. Finishing his book in no time is just the tip of the iceberg. As his mind's capacity is limitless, so was his personal and financial success. But of course, there is no such thing as a perfect drug. As his body experiences the physical side effects, his life seemed like it was also careening into a violent crash. Can Eddie stop the vortex into his own self-destruction? Or can there be something good that comes out of all this?Bradley Cooper, with all his alpha-male screen presence, was not really convincing as Unsuccessful Eddie. But when he transforms into Successful Eddie, he really goes to town with his confident portrayal. This movie was practically a one-man show for Cooper. Abbie Cornish (as Eddie's girlfriend Lindy) and Robert De Niro (as Eddie's boss Van Loon) were not really that material to the plot. The movie had a fascinating premise as NZT was supposed to open up all the corners of our mind. The director had a very imaginative way of executing this idea for the big screen. The special effects done for this were very good. However, because the drug was supposed to make your mind work one hundred percent, sometimes you will wonder why Eddie still gets himself into all these stupid problematic situations. You would think he would have foreseen all possible scenarios before he decides to do something.Ironically then, you need to tell your own mind not to over-think when watching this movie. It is practically a morality tale about drug addiction and its evils. I did not really like the way it ended. There were so many ways the movie could have gone at the end, but the one they chose did not satisfy me at all.",6,0,1,26 March 2011
Departures," Absolutely Beautiful and Sublime
","Fortunately for me, this film had won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film. If not, I may not have even known about this masterpiece of modern Japanese cinema. I have seen two of the other nominees, 'The Class' and 'Waltz with Bashir' both of whom are excellent as well. But 'Departures' definitely deserves the honor of winning.Kobayashi Daigo is a young cellist who just lost his job as the his orchestra in Tokyo was disbanded. He decides to leave city life behind and bring his wife back to his hometown. There he answers a want ad which he thought was for a travel agency. But it turns out, the 'journeys' handled by this firm is of the eternal kind. Despite his initial aversion to the job, Daigo learns to love and be very good with the Japanese rite of 'encoffining', or preparing the dead body for the casket.With this rather moribund premise, the director Yojiro Takita was able to weave a most interesting and touching film experience to enthrall us all. It is both funny and sad. It is both entertaining and informative. It is a movie that proudly exhibits the uniquely Japanese rites of enconffining (nokanshi). Yet it is also universal in its celebration of the spirit of reconciliation between family members.The cinematography is masterful, managing to be both majestic and intimate in the appropriate scenes. The music soundtrack, especially the cello playing, is excellent and evocative. The lead actor (Masahiro Motoki) is very effective in showing the maturation of Daigo in his craft and in his life. Daigo and his wife Mika make quite a (excuse the word) 'cute' couple (looking like a typical young Asian telenovela love team), who also mature in their relationship. The climactic scenes of Daigo and his father are heart-wrenching yet uplifting, and handled with utmost love and respect. This is most definitely a most beautiful and sublime movie, not to be missed.",10,1,2,19 June 2009
Les Misérables," A Perfect Cinematic Version of a Broadway Musical
","This film faithfully follows the story flow of the musical theater hit by Claude-Michel Schonberg and Alain Boublil. This musical had so many well-loved songs and they were all here. Director Tom Hooper employed a very striking close-up shots of most of these very dramatic, heart- rending musical performances. It is well-publicized that Hooper also required his stars to be actually singing live during the take, and this fact makes the performances all the more amazing. It was also very good that they had added certain details from the original novel by Victor Hugo (like Fantine selling her teeth or meeting Marius' grandfather) to further enhance this version.The trailer already showed us the haunting rendition of Anne Hathaway of Fantine's 'I Dreamed a Dream.' But what we see in the actual film, is Anne singing it in stark close-up, in one long single take, while tears were flowing down her cheeks. This was perfection! Her Golden Globe win, Oscar nomination and likely win is absolutely deserved.Hugh Jackman had a larger than life screen presence. I cannot imagine any other Hollywood star who has the physical and vocal attributes appropriate for the demanding role of Jean Valjean, an ex-convict who spends his lifetime trying to make up for the sins of his past. Hugh is already an Tony-award winning musical theater star so his singing credentials cannot be questioned. His Golden Globe win and Oscar nomination for this film is also well-deserved. I would even go out on a limb and say that Hugh's performance as Valjean is more emotionally- stirring than Daniel Day-Lewis' was in 'Lincoln.' I want him to win that Oscar.The third member of the cast that I was most impressed with was Eddie Redmayne who played Marius. After watching and hearing him perform the shows most romantic and stirring songs like 'A Heart Full of Love', 'A Little Fall of Rain' and most especially, 'Empty Chairs and Empty Tables,' I was really surprised that he did not receive any awards consideration at all. He was really very good as the young romantic lead. He had good chemistry with both the fair Cossette (Amanda Siefried) and the tragic Eponine (Samantha Barks).Many critics have been hard on Russell Crowe and his singing. It was not really that bad though, though his versions of 'Stars' and 'Javert's Suicide' were not exactly what we expect from stage performances. It is of course not fair to judge it this way since acting style would be different in stage and screen. The vibrant cinematography, the production design, the costumes all effectively capture the squalor and turmoil of Paris during the French Revolution, all fully deserving of awards as well. OK, being a theater geek, and I may be biased. But now that I have seen all nine nominees, in all fairness I can declare that 'Les Miserables' is the most deserving movie for that Oscar Best Picture grand prize!",10,7,12,17 January 2013
In Time," Great Look, Interesting Concept
","When I first heard about this movie entitled 'In Time' and its sci-fi concept of humans live to the age of 25, I sort of imagined a story sort of like 'Logan's Run.'. This made me want to catch it. After watching the film, that it wasn't really quite the 'Logan's Run' scenario that I expected it to be. I was amazed at how innovatively the writer and director Andrew Niccol (he of 'Gattaca' and 'The Truman Show') presented his highly original concept of how our future may be. 'In Time' presents a very interesting world of the future where human aging stops at 25 years old. After that, you can survive only with the amount of extra time you have earned and saved from your daily livelihood and other activities. Time is therefore their currency, and one's remaining time is marked on a glowing digital clock on one's forearm. When you are very rich in time, you can certainly live forever. When you run out of time, you die that very instant. Ingenious!Will Salas is a guy from the poor side of town. His mom (played by younger actress Olivia Wilde) dies out because her clock ran out before she and Will were able to get together on the night of her birthday. Will resolves to avenge her death by fighting the very system that their society runs on. Taking with him the daughter of a rich banker named Sylvia Weis (Amanda Seyfried) as his lover and partner-in-crime, the pair goes on a spree to steal deposited time in banks and in turn give it away to those poor in time. The Time Police led by dedicated officer Raymond Leon (Cillian Murphy) and a gang of time extortionists led by Fortis (Alex Pettyfer) provide the exciting conflicts and consequent cat-and-mouse chases that propel the story forward.The movie looks very slick and polished in terms of its overall look, camera work and colors. As the cast members are ALL young, it was certainly a very handsome-looking world indeed that they have created. It was obvious that Niccol had fun in showing people from different generations all portrayed by actors in their twenties, such that you really could not guess how one character was related to the other. In my opinion though, Justin Timberlake looked miscast as the hero Will Salas. I was thinking that maybe it could have been better if JT and Alex Pettyfer traded roles. JT could probably have played the antagonist role more credibly. Cillian Murphy though was perfect in his role, especially with his characteristically intense face. Amanda Seyfried has really gone a long way from 'Mamma Mia.'Save for some quibbles about how easy it seemed to take time away from a person and how careless some characters are about their time, I was nonetheless thoroughly entertained by this stylish Bonnie and Clyde meet Robin Hood story in a futuristic Logan's Run setting. The imaginative creativity of Andrew Niccol is very commendable. His incisive social commentary about the gap between rich and poor in the script would also not be lost on the audience.",7,2,6,7 November 2011
Thor," Those who did not know Thor now know him
","Marvel does it again with another A-quality screen interpretation of the comic book hero The Mighty Thor. The heart-stopping action, the dark family drama and the well-placed humor were all perfectly realized on screen by Shakespearian director Kenneth Branagh. I wonder why the DC people could not do the same with their similarly iconic superheroes. (Really, Ryan Reynolds as Green Lantern,? Please! But I digress.)It is amazing that the two main characters Thor and Loki were played by new actors who were unknown to me. Chris Hemsworth is perfectly cast as the cocky Nordic thunder god. Not only does he look the part physically, the way he acted out his character's arc is well-done and worthy of audience empathy. It was not forced nor corny. Tom Hiddleston also convincingly plays out his character Loki with the unpredictability this god was known for. Anthony Hopkins plays Odin by ear, as he is well-known for. Natalie Portman, fresh from her Oscar for Best Actress, looks as beautiful as her character requires. It was also exciting to see a cameo by Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton ('Hawkeye') with his bow and arrow!The story is solid. Those of us who did not know Thor now know him and care what happens to him. The fight scenes were very exciting. The special effects were very good for the most part. For negatives, I did not really like how fake Asgard looked and I did not like the metallic robot used to attack the earth. The costumes on Asgard also reminded me too much of various Bozanian bad guys from the old Voltes V cartoons. There were some inconsistencies about how Bifrost tele-porter works. Overall though, this was excellent and the first real big action blockbuster of this summer. I did not even watch the 3D version.",8,4,9,1 May 2011
The Happening," It 's All About the Incredibly Tense Atmosphere
","I purposely went into this movie knowing nothing about it. We learned from his debut film and hit 'The Sixth Sense', that you should not try to find out about his movies' plots before you go see it. After the success of 'The Sixth Sense', the reviews had been mixed. However, I still consider his movies must-sees on the big screen. While I liked 'The Village', 'Signs' was just so-so. But I positively hated 'The Lady in the Water' to the point that I almost walked out on it. After that, I have learned not to expect too much anymore.Now in this latest one 'The Happening,' the concept is very interesting. People in the Northeast United States are suddenly stricken with an inexplicable urge to kill themselves. You can imagine the tension built around people trying to figure out and escape this unknown entity that seems to be coming from the wind and the plants around them. As I wrote that last sentence, it seems to be an absurd storyline. But on screen as directed by the suspense master M. Night, it was not bad at all. The way it was rendered made me empathize with the plight of these hapless people.The lead star is Marky Mark Walberg was like I have never seen him before. He plays a high school science teacher in Philadelphia in this one. He struggles with his own problems with his wife (played by the very cute Zooey Deschamel) as he tries to escape the unknown scourge of nature. The train they were riding to get out of town had to make a forced stop in small town Filbert, Pennsylvania as transportation systems also go haywire. From there it was a process of figuring out how on earth they could keep alive.Maybe it will take an open attitude to like this film. Skeptics and nit-pickers will find a lot of things to criticize. For me, I liked this movie as a whole. The corny parts were there all right, but I felt they can just be glossed over without affecting the overall feel. Just be there to 'enjoy' the tension and the atmosphere of the whole (hopefully unreal) human experience unfolding on the screen. It is most definitely there for all of us to feel and be enveloped in.P.S. As a bonus, they finally showed the trailer of the very hush-hush upcoming 'X-Files' Movie!!! That is definitely my most anticipated movie event in the coming month.",7,1,5,18 June 2008
Zombieland," More Funny Than Horror
","Have we been so jaded already by the preponderance of these types of films? I do not even think we even flinch anymore when we watch 'Zombieland' or similar types. Zombie films are the perfect excuse to do mindless violence to human bodies without them being objectionable to watch. Zombieland is another one of such blood and gore extravaganza.You have to inject something new into the formula to make it stand out among its sub-genre. 'Dead Snow' was unique in its snowy locale and Nazi zombies. 'Zombieland' will have to thank Woody Harrelson's reckless performance as Tallahassee as its trump card. Woody is known for crazy roles before, but he is quite the star in this movie because of his natural and effective devil-may-care performance. 'Zombieland' also has a hidden gem in its middle section with a surprise star cameo by a celebrity whose gates carry the initials of 'BM'. That part of the film is also really hilarious and quite memorable.Overall it is a funny zombie movie. It lists some interesting rules about how to survive zombies. It has a romance in there somewhere. Best of all, it is short and direct to the point. Zombie movie fans will surely enjoy it.",6,0,0,12 March 2010
The Departed," Great Action!
","This must be the first Oscar worthy movie I have seen this year. Wow, the actors are all top-notch. Leonardo is very good here. Jack Nicholson is his sinister self, as always. The story and pacing of the movie was very exciting. Excellent and must-see. Violence and blood abound, so queasy ones beware. The actress who played the love interest seems inadequate in her role, being the only unknown in the cast (to me, at least). In fact, the fact that these three do not intersect at any one point in the movie is one of my minor peeves in the storytelling, as it is quite unlikely given the situation the lady doctor is in.",9,2,6,5 October 2006
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Exciting Yes. But Also Disappointing
","Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is as exciting as summer blockbusters go. The signature Michael Bay explosions are definitely there. The machinery and the cars were all a great sight to see, as well as Megan Fox. The robot transformations scenes, the chase scenes, the fight scenes, all very excellently staged and executed as far as visual effects are concerned.However, for this particular blockbuster, I think the main problem is story-telling. When we understand what the Fallen meant, it seemed insignificant already. Focus is seriously lacking. It seems that story telling fell secondary to the explosive special effects and occasionally lame comedy schticks (particularly from Sam's mom and his roommate Leo).Part of this problem is time management. Everything in the script took too long to tell on screen. One example of a particularly over-long sequence is the climactic run of Sam to deliver the Matrix to Optimus Prime. It was one very extended series of indistinguishable gun battles interrupted by seemingly endless scenes of our two heroes running. Of course, these running scenes had to be in slow motion in order to emphasize Megan's jiggling anatomy for the boys in the audience (haha!)As a whole, it is OK for a lazy afternoon with the kids, as we did so today. The kids found it awesome and extreme, as could be predicted. However, we know there could have been better story-telling by its director, who seemed to be more concerned with the superficial embellishments rather than the core spirit of the story.",6,1,5,25 June 2009
Jersey Boys," The Music Uplifts the Story
","'The Jersey Boys' brings us all back to the early 1960s, young Francis Castelluccio, a hairdresser's apprentice with a unique high falsetto singing voice, takes on the name Frankie Valli. Together with a couple of petty criminals named Tommy DeVito and Nick Massi, they would sing in small gigs around town, going nowhere, except in jail when caught. When they meet a hot singer-songwriter named Bob Gaudio, they called themselves the Four Seasons and started a hot streak of Number One hits on the radio. However, their connections to the mob and loan sharks lead to strains within the group and their families.It is the timeless music of the Four Seasons that keep this rather heavy-handed biopic afloat. It was hard to imagine that this film gets its origins from a successful original Broadway musical. Director Clint Eastwood takes things a little too seriously. It actually lacked excitement, humor and joy until they break into those unforgettable hit songs such as 'Sherry', 'Big Girls Don't Cry' and 'Walk Like a Man'. It was strange that they play 'My Eyes Adored You' (a solo Number One hit for Valli in 1975) before we see Valli perform his first solo hit, the Number 2 song 'Can't Take My Eyes Off You.' It was also odd to hear that the producers at that time considered the very catchy 'Can't' to be an experimental song that was unlikely to be a hit.The four lead actors were unknown to me. They were supposed to have sung these songs themselves which is very impressive. The actor who played Frankie Valli is John Lloyd Young, who actually won a Tony for this same role in Broadway. His singing voice is unmistakably similar in quality to Valli's, and his singing scenes were glorious. However, he did look a bit old to play a 16-year old at the start. Also, in the non-singing parts, his theatrical style of acting was too dour and mannered for the big screen.Doing better were the other three guys in the group. I liked the way Eastwood made them relate the story to the audience while they were still in the scene, like breaking the fourth wall. Vincent Piazza did not originate from the stage version, but he really shone as the rouge Tommy. Michael Lomenda had his musical and serio-comic moments as the deep-voiced Nick. However, the most potent screen charisma was from Erich Bergen as the clean-cut Bob.I was surprised that the local Film Classification Board rated this film as PG when there are a lot of profanity, suggestions of drug abuse and scenes of sexual nature. These will be a bit awkward for parents who bring their kids in to watch. However, it is the music that will remain to be the most memorable aspect of this film. Their final performance at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990 was electric (despite the bad aging make-up). I wanted to stand up and cheer. I positively loved the scene at the end credits set to the tune of 'Oh What a Night', which looked like an actual stage curtain call. These final moments certainly buoyed up the whole film and left a good lasting impression and last song syndrome.",7,1,3,17 July 2014
Zero Dark Thirty," Only the Last 30 Minutes Mattered
","I expected a lot from 'Zero Dark Thirty' because of all the awards buzz it is receiving lately, the latest being nominated for Oscar Best Picture. It was the next project of Kathryn Bigelow who impressed me with her direction of 'The Hurt Locker.' It was supposed to show us what really happened behind what it calls the 'greatest manhunt in history'-- that of Usama Bin Laden (who the movie called UBL).We follow a character named Maya (Jessica Chastain) whom we know or learn nothing about, except that her whole career after college was devoted to the search for UBL. Too bad we never really knew anything more about her background for us to root for her obsession. She was not really the 'cool' person we expect these CIA operatives to be. There were several scenes where Maya seemed very unprofessional in her behavior. Maya discussed confidential matters publicly in a restaurant. She screamed and threatened her superior in a corridor. She writes numbers on the glass pane of her boss' office to countdown the days of inaction. They may be good for cinematic drama, but these were very unrealistic for a film that was supposedly factual. Watching this film could be an ordeal as the story was told in a VERY slow burn. This is a 2 and a half hour film, mind you, for a story with an ending we already know. The first hour we see how CIA torture suspects from 911, and witness various suicide bombings. The second hour we see Maya act on a random tip about a courier who could be working for UBL. We then wait 130 days with her for the higher-ups to approve a raid on a compound in Pakistan where she was 100% sure UBL was located based on circumstantial evidence, with no direct visualization. It was only in the last 30 minutes that we finally see the raid on the UBL compound we had been waiting for. This was a riveting sequence of masterful film editing and night vision cinematography. It was only these last 30 minutes that really mattered to me, and maybe also to you.",5,5,33,11 January 2013
Crazy Heart," Story is Old Hat, But Jeff Bridges Shines
","Back in 1983, Robert Duvall played an alcoholic country singer whose life was changed by a loving woman in 'Tender Mercies'. He won an Oscar for Best Actor for that performance. Tess Harper who played his love interest got nominated for Best Supporting Actress. Now, 16 years later, Jeff Bridges is poised to win the same Oscar for playing a similar character in a basically similar story. And Maggie Gyllenhaal who plays the love interest also earns a Best Supporting Actress nod.While watching this film, everything about it felt old and predictable. You simply know you had seen it all before. (In fact, just last year, Mickey Rourke just did the same washed-up star turn but in a more exciting arena in 'The Wrestler'. Coincidentally, Marisa Tomei who played his love interest also got nominated for Best Supporting Actress.) The long running time of two hours with repetitive sequences did not help at all. The storytelling was slow and tedious. I am not really a fan of country music, but the good catchy songs in this movie kept the movie afloat.The real reason to watch 'Crazy Heart' though is to see Jeff Bridges live his role of 'Bad' Blake. It seemed so real. I also admire his country singing voice -- very energetic, heartfelt and on-tune, even when he was singing drunk. Jeff Bridges had been Oscar nominated four times before: 'The Last Picture Show' (supporting, 1971), 'Thunderbolt and Lightfoot' (supporting, 1974), 'Starman' (1984), and 'The Contender' (2000). While his competition this year is also tight, as Morgan Freeman ('Invictus') and Jeremy Renner ('The Hurt Locker') also successfully inhabited their respective roles, all signs point that the Oscar for Best Actor is Jeff Bridges' to lose.The standout in the supporting cast for me is not really Maggie Gyllenhaal, who did not really do anything different or innovative. But Colin Farrell is a revelation in his portrayal of Bad Blake's protégé turned current star Tommy Sweet. His thick Irish accent all but disappeared in his effective Southern drawl. His country singing style is also very good. It is also notable that Robert Duvall also appears here as Bad Blake's loyal fan and friend.",6,2,5,19 February 2010
12 Years a Slave," The Oscar Hype May Give Unrealistic Expectatations
","Slavery is indeed a heinous crime against humanity that existed in the United States in the past. I had seen this crime brought to life in numerous films from the 'Roots' mini-series in my youth up to 'Django Unchained' last year.'12 Years a Slave' is yet another film that brings back those sordid days of suffering indignities and torture while forced to work in those cotton fields in the American South. Truth to tell, I felt the scenes depicting these horrific events were not really different from what we have seen in the past. Maybe, the level of violence may have been amped up by available technology, but the painful message remains the same.The interesting details which were new to me were those that depicted the abduction of free Northern Afro-Americans to be forced into slavery. It was also terrible to see the slave selling scenes featuring a sinister cameo by Paul Giamatti. But these happen within the first hour of the film. The rest of the film already felt squeamishly familiar, but harder to watch because the floggings approach (though thankfully not exceed) 'Passion of the Christ' levels. The acclaim and awards-buzz that precedes the performance of lead actor Chiwetel Ejiofor is much-deserved. His Solomon Northup maintains his dignity even under the yoke of slavery. Michael Fassbender (a favorite star of director Steve McQueen) is very effective as evil incarnated as slave owner, the cruel Edwin Epps. But, sad to say, I felt he did not bring anything we have not seen before to this type of role.First-time film actress Lupita Nyong'o had a heart-rending debut as Patsey, the young female slave who was the unfortunate apple of the leering eyes of Master Epps, which makes the blood of jealous Mistress Epps (a cold Sarah Paulsen) boil. The technical aspect of the film were all first-rate, from the cinematography, to the production design, to the costumes, to the music. Maybe the Oscar hype around this film may have given me unrealistic expectations. It was not bad by any measure, but just not as excellent as I was expecting it to be.",7,3,6,4 January 2014
There Will Be Blood," Overcooked Masterpiece
","This movie is almost a one-man show. And that one man is Daniel Day-Lewis.At first I thought I was watching a silent movie. The background story of Daniel Plainsview's humble beginning as a silver miner who got lucky hitting an oil deposit and how he adopted the infant son of a worker who got killed in the mine (whom he named HW), was all told in images and music, no dialogue. You knew you were in for a different type of movie. The first words were said only thirty minutes or so into the movie.This is one of those epic (2 hrs. and 40 minutes, but it certainly felt longer than that) movies about oil. 'Giant' with James Dean immediately comes to mind, but this movie did not have the gentility of Rock Hudson and Elizabeth Taylor. This movie is as dirty and grimy, and ruthless as it gets.Essentially it depicted how Daniel (with HW in tow) sweet-talks his way with the simple backward folk in order to cheaply get their oil-blessed property. Then, problems arose when Daniel did not want his oil well blessed by the young preacher Eli. From there, misfortunes started to happen, worst of which was when HW suffered total deafness because of an oil rig explosion. Daniel's life was never the same after that. Towards the end, he was a broken drunk rich man, with plenty of unresolved conflict within him, that results in tragic consequences.I have liked DDL ever since he played the genteel Cecil in 'A Room With A View'. Now, more than 20 years later, DDL is really in an acting tour-de-force in 'There Will Be Blood'. However, I must say that this acting was also flawed in a way. It started out really well, DDL was really very good in those early scenes as an oil speculator. But when religion came into the picture, I felt his acting went over the top, as if it was for a stage play. There was a scene when he had to submit himself to joining the church of Eli, subjecting himself to a 'throwing out the demons' ceremony in order to get access to a piece of land. And then there was that scene in the end where he used milkshakes as a metaphor for how he had been able to get oil was a case of too much self-conscious acting. The over-acting in these scenes, not only by DDL, but also Paul Dano (who played preacher Eli), was almost humorous in its excess.I liked this one better than 'No Country For Old Men' as it had more substance and structure by its writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson (of 'Magnolia' fame). The cinematography was very impressive. The camera work and editing of that big scene of the fateful oil rig explosion that made HW deaf was also very good. The musical score was something else. There was no sweeping music as you would expect from epics like that of 'Dances With Wolves'. Instead there were these seemingly unrelated pieces of music, that do not seem to be appropriate to the scene. It felt experimental in a way. It was interesting though. This movie was clearly trying to be a cinematic masterpiece, but I think its efforts are too obvious and obtrusive. Not bad by any measure, but I think it went a little overboard.",6,3,8,3 February 2008
Burlesque," A Series of Burlesque Number Strung Together by a Very Thin Plot
","We have all seen this story before. Small town girl goes into the big city to seek better fortune. She also meets the man of her dreams. She gets a good job in this small business. The business is about to be lost due to a real estate developer. But our heroine saves the day, and gets her man! 'Burlesque' follows this routine cliché to the T! Ali (Christina Aguilera in her film debut) is from Iowa. She goes to LA and gets entranced by a Burlesque joint owned by Tess (Cher). Tess is problematic because she owes money to her ex-husband (Peter Gallagher) and a real estate developer (Eric Dane) wants her to sell her place to him. Meanwhile, Ali graduates from waitress to back-up dancer to star because of her awesome singing talent. Her friendship with bartender Jack (Cam Gigandet) also graduates from friendship to love. All so predictable! Nothing really to spoil, all the way up to the happy ending.This thin story gets stretched to two hours because of numerous burlesque song and dance numbers. I am not really fond of this type of entertainment. Christina Aguilera can really sing though. I have seen a concert of hers once, and she had done the same burlesque type numbers already before. Her acting was too shrill and unrealistic. I was not really rooting for her because she came across as cocky and annoying. I did not find any of her songs memorable.I have to admit that I admire Cher and her voice. My favorite song number from the movie was by Cher, a breathtaking 'You Have Not Seen The Last of Me Yet.' The way it was introduced was a bit forced, but the song is very good. It won the Golden Globe for Best Song, but I wonder why it was not even nominated for an Oscar. She sort of plays herself here, as Tess is an aging star, like her. She did not really need to do any acting.This is not as bad as 'Glitter' by any measure. But I suspect it would not really appeal too much to the general public, except for fans of Cher and Christina Aguilera. I simply felt like a series of burlesque song and dance numbers strung together by the thinnest of plot lines.",5,0,1,8 February 2011
Edge of Tomorrow," Tom Cruise At His Best!
","'Edge of Tomorrow' shows us a different Tom Cruise. In contrast with his past heroic characters, all valiant and unafraid, his character here Major William Cage is a big coward, trying to weasel his way out of an order to be in the front line of battle against the Mimics, an unstoppable alien race about to take over the whole world.However, as Cage kills and gets killed by another sort of alien creature called the Alpha, he wakes up to relive this day of battle and die over and over again, only to live another day. However, with every return engagement, Cage would meet and work together with war heroine Rita Vrataski, gaining more and more combat skills and cunning, to seek out and destroy the main alien creature called the Omega.Tom Cruise gets to flex his comedic charms which we do not see often enough. His playing a coward at first was so unlikely of him, it was fresh and funny. Of course, his action and fight sequences were naturally looked good for him, even though these scenes did come later on in the film. This was a very good performance from him, so natural and charming. Cruise has still got that movie star charisma and he certainly knows how to choose these projects which would ensure his career longevity in the A-list.This is the first time I have seen Emily Blunt in an action film, and she surprised me. She is both sexy and formidable as Rita. She has a palpable chemistry with Cruise, which was entertaining. This girl can really stand her own with the best of them.This film comes right at the heels of last year's excellent 'Oblivion', also a futuristic sci-fi film starring Tom Cruise and a British leading lady. Both are entertaining in their own way, but the story and the treatment are from being the same. Where 'Oblivion' is all white and sterile-looking with a very serious style of story-telling, 'Edge of Tomorrow' is dirty, gritty and fun, with a sharp sense of humor.",8,4,9,2 June 2014
Pitch Perfect 2," Punch-Packing Pitches
","I was late on the first 'Pitch Perfect' bandwagon when it was first shown back in 2012 and became a sleeper hit. I did not rate it too highly when I wrote my review about it, giving it only a 6/10. I cited that I did not like the lead character of Beca as played by Anna Kendrick. I thought the singing scenes were hit and miss, with the climactic final number ruined by a pitchy solo by Kendrick. However, with repeated viewings with my kids, I confess that I eventually warmed up to the movie, and the Bellas. The whole family was very excited to watch this sequel the first chance we had.In Part 2, we see the Barden Bellas on a roll after winning the Nationals three years in a row. However during a fateful command performance in front of the President of the USA at Lincoln Center, Fat Amy had a wild wardrobe malfunction disaster which plunged the Bellas into major shame and competition suspension. In order to redeem themselves, they enlist to join the formidable World Acapella Competitions, which no US team has ever won. This film shows how they try to recover the group harmony they lost, as they face graduation and welcome a talented new Bella in their midst. Since we all know these girls very well already, it was really great to see them all again. Anna Kendrick's Beca Mitchell is again her dour self, but she is more tolerable now than in the first film. She secretly enters an internship in a recording company in pursuit of her dream to become a record producer. This gave her a chance to interact with a very funny Keegan-Michael Key as her boss. I liked the guesting stint of Snoop Dogg in the scene where Beca got to show her boss her mixing skills. Rebel Wilson's Fat Amy is wilder than ever, even getting herself a big solo number and an official boyfriend in this one. Brittany Snow's obsessed Chloe is still my personal favorite, deliberately flunking a required subject just to remain a Bella. The rest of the girls, butch Cynthia-Rose (Ester Dean), sexy Stacie (Alexis Knapp) and mysterious Lilly (Hana Mae Lee), are all still there, though not as much as the first film. We meet a new Bella in the person of Emily (Hailee Steinfeld), who has a knack for writing original songs. I was more excited to see 'Married with Children' Katey Sagal as Emily's mother, but too bad her part was too short.Their rival boy group the Treblemakers, including Jesse (Skylar Astin) and Benji (Ben Platt), were pretty much in the background only this time. Annoying former Treblemaker leader Bumper (Adam DeVine) returns to Bardem as a security guard, and gets a bigger part here as Fat Amy's love interest. The main antagonist in this film are the ruthless and joyless German team, Das Sound Machine, led by two towering Aryan bullies Pieter Krämer (Flula Borg) and Kommissar (Birgitte Hjort Sørensen). Getting much more exposure and more grating and potentially offensive racist and misogynistic remarks are the competition commentator duo of Gail Abernathy-McKadden-Feinberg (Elizabeth Banks) and John Smith (John Michael Higgins). Higgins in particular was really given very sharp and controversial lines to deliver, which could be very funny -- but only if you are not in the demographic he is dissing. The best singing scenes in this sequel was still the Riff-Off part, just as this was my favorite part in the first film. The mash-ups were seamless and the singing was dope. The first such sing-off with the category of songs about butts was made even more hilarious by the guest appearance of buff and burly football players, the Green Bay Packers, singing 'Bootilicious' of all songs! You have to see and hear it to believe it. In the international competition at the end, we see Pentatonix representing Canada and Fil-am group Filharmonic representing the Philippines, which were nice surprises.If you liked the first Pitch Perfect film, I think you will like this one more. I thought the acapella song numbers were much better arranged and executed here than the first. I liked the throwback reference to 'When You're Gone', the 'Cups Song' which was a top 10 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 for Anna Kendrick long after the film had left the cinemas. The original song featured in this one, 'Flashlight,' is promising potential hit as well. The story had the right balance of comedy and drama to delight and touch fans, told pretty well by first time director Elizabeth Banks, on triple duty here as producer and star as well. In spite the occasional shallow senseless jokes or race- and gender-insensitive comments, I'd call 'Pitch Perfect 2' THE feel-good good-time film for this summer of 2015. 7/10.",7,7,14,15 May 2015
Whiplash," Good Job
","Andrew Nieman is a shy freshman in the Schaefer Conservatory of Music in New York City. He does not have friends as he is always obsessively practicing on his drums. He catches the attention of a notoriously hard- driving teacher Terence Fletcher. Fletcher recruits Andrew to join his studio jazz band. There, Fletcher pushes Nieman to perfect playing of his instrument with an abrasive instruction style that teeters on military drill sergeant abuse, both physically and emotionally. Will Andrew make it through or will he snap under the pressure?Miles Teller is a young star on the rise. He was in three other films this year alone, 'That Awkward Moment', 'Divergent' and 'Two Night Stand.' He is set to be seen as Mr. Fantastic in the reboot of The Fantastic Four next year, along with four other films. 'Whiplash' proves that he is also a serious actor to reckon with. As the drums prodigy Andrew, Teller looks like he mastered playing that drum set for real for this difficult role. Unlike the piano, it is hard to fake playing the drums. His passion in playing is palpable from across the screen.J.K. Simmons, whom many of us only know as J. Jonah Jameson, Peter Parker's boss, in the Tobey Maguire Spider-Man films, plays the irascible Mr. Fletcher, a teacher who is never satisfied with only good enough. He plays a hateful character who tended to exceed his boundaries as a mentor, but Simmons imbues Fletcher with other layers so we do not only see him as just the villain. Be it in his expletive-laden tirades or with just one penetrating stare, Simmons drips a malevolence we all feel.'Whiplash' features some glorious jazz performances since this is about a jazz band. I personally do not like jazz so much, but the precision of the playing and the richness of the music is hard to resist. The perfectly-edited scenes showing the band as they played the most formidable-looking sheets of music had the vigor and energy of a sports match. That super-intense final scene alone will literally keep you at the edge of your seat. The audience in the theater where I watched erupted into spontaneous applause when it ended.This is certainly not just another 'Mr. Holland's Opus' or 'Music of the Heart'. Writer and director Damien Chazelle gives us the same basic student-teacher drama and beautiful music, but presented his story in a most unexpectedly disturbing, suspenseful, violent and even horrific way.",9,2,11,20 October 2014
The Wolf of Wall Street," Excessive Excess
","'The Wolf of Wall Street' is about the rise and fall of one Jordan Belfort, a fast-talking con man selling penny stocks to unsuspecting clients to earn that whopping 50% commission, until he built up a financial empire with simply too much money than they know what to do with. Jordan and his cohorts, led by the loud and obnoxious Donnie Azoff, lead a life of unbridled debauchery, until the arms of the law finally catch up with them.While this film seemed like it was celebrating the crime Belfort was perpetrating, director Martin Scorsese told it in a very frenetic and entertaining way. The structure of the film was odd though, as the first two hours plus was about the wild lifestyle Belfort had in the lap of luxury, but only the last 40 minutes or so was about his inevitable fall and retribution. Leonardo DiCaprio summons again his inimitable charm and charisma we saw before in 'Catch Me If You Can' to higher stakes criminal activity as Belfort. Leonardo amped up his millionaire characters in 'The Aviator' and 'The Great Gatsby', giving everything he had for this role and his burning passion that oozes through the screen. He has this hilarious sequence when he had a catatonic fit after taking a strong drug, never knew Leo was capable of such physical comedy.Jonah Hill playing Belfort's reckless partner Donnie with rabid perversity, like 'This Is The End' goes to New York high society. He has excellent chemistry with DiCaprio. The classy, beautiful and sexy Margot Robbie plays Naomi, the hot socialite who swept Belfort off his feet. In smaller but still notable roles were Matthew McConaughey with a very short stint as Belfort's first Wall Street mentor, Rob Reiner as Belfort's prudent father, Jean Dujardin as Belfort's European contact and Kyle Chandler as the FBI agent who wanted to bring Belfort down at all costs.After the first one and half hours of the over-the-top excessively obscene lifestyle Jordan and pals live, you will feel that all of this depiction of debauchery is kind of getting too repetitive and long for comfort. There will be scenes of sexual orgies of all kinds to the point of misogyny. There will be multiple scenes of almost everybody taking drugs and all the wild effects. Your ears will feel numbed with all the foul language that was integrated in seemingly every one of their sentences. However, the pedigree of the people behind this film, Scorsese and DiCaprio, the brilliant cinematography and opulent production design, all remind us that this is still an A-list project, not some raunchy blue movie drowning in kilos of cocaine and naked prostitutes. I just think the first two hours felt like they could have been shortened without significantly affecting the plot. It could have lost some of the excessive scenes of excess. We got the point already. 7/10.",7,9,15,14 January 2014
The Last King of Scotland," Great Acting! and Gillian Anderson!
","I like movies based on real people in history. Because of the Oscar buzz surrounding Forest Whitaker now, I knew this movie is about Idi Amin. This is of course a familiar name in my childhood (asked in General Information contests), but I don't really know much about him, except that he was a dictator.This film has a documentary feel to it. It is really very realistic, even if upon reading background info that the Dr. Garrigan character is fictional. Even though granted that the Idi Amin regime was compressed into a coherent Hollywood storyline, it does not feel contrived. The final sequence of events at the Entebbe Airport was very suspenseful indeed.Idi Amin was not really the lead character in this movie. It is actually Dr. Nicholas Garrigan. Being a physician, I could not help but be able to identify with his situation and dilemmas. Would you accept to be the personal physician of a country's president upon his personal request? It seems to be an offer and career opportunity you could not refuse.There is sex and violence in this movie. I could not agree though with Dr. Garrigan's rashness regarding his love affairs, particularly his morals of hooking up with wives of his supposed friends. But considering that this movie is set in the 1970s, that was a totally different world pre-HIV. The violence, what can I say? After watching one violent film after the other, you get sort of anesthetized already. That said, the scene with hooks at the airport was still something else! The acting is very good. Forest Whitaker has channeled the Idi Amin persona very effectively. I could feel the scary and suffocating craziness whenever he is on screen. There's something about this performance being based on a real character though. I think it would be harder to essay a totally fictional character since you have to create this new character from scratch. And I feel James McAvoy (who was actually Mr. Tumnus in 'Narnia'!) did so very well as Dr. Garrigan. You dislike him, yet you can empathize the stickiness of his situation.Before I end this review, I have to mention that I was very happy to see the luminous Ms. Gillian Anderson again. I totally did not know she was in this film and it was a welcome surprise. She handled her few scenes as the wife of a volunteer doctor very well indeed. I hope she gets meatier movie roles in the future.",9,61,84,24 February 2007
American Gangster," Not Bad...But Needs Streamlining
","This is a very long movie. I must admit that I felt every minute of it. It is not that it is a bad movie. The story of Frank Lucas (played very well by Denzel Washington) and his rise from aide to top drug honcho during the turbulent and decadent late 60s to early 70s is very interesting. I thought this story alone would have made a pretty good movie in itself. His devotion to his boss, his commitment to his mother (Ruby Dee), his relationship with his wife, his violent streak, his business acumen, all make excellent However, this interesting storyline is interrupted by so many seemingly interfering events that were given too much time. The entire story involving the life of Russell Crowe felt like an entirely different movie altogether. But since he is Russell Crowe, the story of this policeman-lawyer, needed to be extended more than it really should. The character of Josh Brolin of the corrupt cop Trupo is also given too much time. That one episode involving Cuba Gooding Jr. was also quite incidental, not really material to the flow of the story.So overall, this is not a bad movie. I feel it needed streamlining. It felt like it was trying to tackle too much, thus diluting the total effect.",6,0,4,24 January 2008
The Reader," A Very Morally Polarizing Movie
","This is another one of those difficult to watch movies. Unfortunately, there is nothing neutral about this movie. Anything I mention about it can spoil another person's appreciation of it. I think it would be safe to say that this is a very polarizing movie. It plays two very emotionally charged cards which are bound to upset viewers -- one is about pedophilia, and the other one is about the Holocaust.Yet here it is, a nominee for Best Picture in the upcoming Oscar Awards. Being the most unexpected of the five nominees, this is the film most blamed for kicking out the popular choice 'The Dark Knight'. So, does 'The Reader' measure up? **************** Spoilers ahead! The first third of the movie is of a very sexual nature. The female party Hanna Schmitz is 36, but the male Michael Berg is only 15! OK, granted that even if the female party looks like Kate Winslet, this would still be disturbing for some. Though admittedly not so much than if the sexes were reversed, would it? Aside from this detail, those very frank execution of these sex scenes were really unexpected especially since one party is supposed to be a minor. There was even uninhibited frontal nudity by both Winslet (she's not the Rose of 'Titanic' as we remember it anymore) and the 17 year-old promising (and daring) new actor David Kross. And I thought they did not really resort to such gratuitous exposure anymore these days, but I guess this is the proverbial 'for art's sake' in its truest sense. However, as an unusual fetish, Hanna would request Michael to read books to her before they would make love, thus giving their affair another dimension; and this movie its title.Hanna and Michael's affair occurred in the summer of 1958, abruptly ending when Hanna left the city. The setting then fast forwards to 1966 when Michael was attending law school. As his seminar class sat in on a case involving atrocities of Holocaust guards, he was shocked to hear his beloved Hanna's voice on the witness stand as one of the accused guards. In the trial, Hanna withholds a vital secret that could have spared her from a life sentence. Should Michael reveal himself and this secret he also realized in order to save Hanna? Fast forward again to the 1970s when Michael (now played by a very cold Ralph Fiennes) gets divorced and visits his old home. There he finds his collection of novels, so he suddenly decides to record himself reading these novels aloud as he did before, and send these tapes to Hanna in prison. Of course, these recordings succeeded to buoy and encourage Hanna's spirits and gave her a renewed sense of purpose in life. However, in 1988, the story of Hanna and Michael ends unexpectedly for a reason I am not entirely clear on.The best part of this movie is really Kate Winslet, who is so bold as to accept and tackle such a thanklessly negative role like Hanna, and yet still come out as someone that audiences can somehow sympathize with. This audacity of Ms. Winslet is perhaps why the Academy correctly elevated this role to Lead (not the Supporting that the Golden Globe recognized). However, this is not to downplay Kate's effort in 'Revolutionary Road' which is no walk in the park either. Her roles were both offbeat, irrational and miserable, yet she was able to portray them with sensitivity and dignity. She is ripe for an Oscar win this February.The script loses points with me not really because of the emotional buttons it pushes, but because it fails to clarify character motivations that drive critical moments of the story. The great mystery that the movie's tag-line invites to unlock almost seems too trivial in the greater scheme of the events. That meeting of Berg and the Holocaust survivor at the end was not very well written and fails to evoke its planned dramatic purpose.The treatment by Director Stephen Daldry may be a little too bleak. Although, it has the same feel and look of the other Daldry masterpiece 'The Hours.' But I guess there may have been no other way to portraying the emotionally-charged material, but straightforwardly and frankly, as this movie certainly did.",6,2,5,2 February 2009
The Wrestler," Everything Looks So Real, No Obvious Acting
","'The Wrestler' follows the life of Randy 'The Ram' Robinson, a legendary pro wrestler who was well-liked and famous as he has his own action figure and video game. However, he is now past his prime, almost over his hill, and dealing with big problems about his personal life and his health.This film is almost a documentary. A lot of times it just shows Randy doing a lot of daily stuff around his camper, his gym, his wrestling arenas, his favorite strip joint, his meat counter in the supermarket, etc. Yet in all this realism, there is something riveting and touching about the whole thing.The story is actually very predictable and simple. You can foresee the inevitable plot development and even the ending. It seems like you have seen it all before, but set somewhere else. But somehow it does not matter. Plot is secondary to character study in this movie. I liked how Randy's speech at the end wrapped up what the movie was all about. I also liked how the whole movie ended.This film also shows the world behind the noisy show that is Professional Wrestling -- the surprising camaraderie and good will among the wrestlers, the drugs, the techniques to make the 'performance' realistic, the groupies, etc. Very interesting even for non-wrestling fans. However, some wrestling sequences really go over the top bloody, especially the one with the staple gun.Technically, the whole film is as rough as the world it depicts. The sets, the costumes, the language of the script are all so unpolished, cheap and even trashy. The cinematography is gritty, grainy and shaky, as to lend a very realistic feel to the whole project. You can see 'indie' written all over it.One of the women in The Ram's life is his estranged daughter Stephanie (played by Evan Rachel Wood). This character is sort of the weak link in this movie for me. We understand she is all so angry with her father for abandoning her in the past. But one time, she gave her dad a chance, and they had a good bonding time. Yet when he shows up late for their dinner date, I felt her reaction was a bit extreme! (Of course, we don't really know how deep the previous wounds had been.) All fathers in the audience must have felt a pang in their hearts during that sharply-worded scene.The other woman in his life is Cassidy, Randy's favorite stripper. Marisa Tomei goes all out daring for this electric performance. No conservative camera angles or strategic objects hiding anything. She looks great in this movie, and so does her body! I do not remember any previous film that featured her body so generously before. Her acting is understated and very sensitive. It looked very natural for a role that is so far from how I knew her to be. For this, she was rewarded with a well-deserved Best Supporting Actress nomination by the Academy.But the main man Mickey Rourke IS The Ram. The line between actor and character is definitely blurry here. There seems to be no distinction at all. The actor does not look a thing like his '9 1/2 Weeks' heyday anymore. You cannot recognize this man to be an actor playing a role. He is clearly living this part. It is as if no obvious acting being done. He was repulsive, disgusting and pathetic, yet he can still manage to evoke sympathy and project dignity. Rourke's amazingly real portrayal of 'The Ram' is certainly the centerpiece around which the whole film hinges its Awards credibility.",6,0,1,7 February 2009
Dark Shadows," A Beautiful and Charming Gothic Film Despite the Derivative Script
","I admit I am a bit wary about Tim Burton and his quirky dark films, some of which I did not really like too much. However with so much advanced hype about this particular collaboration with Johnny Depp, I felt compelled to watch it. I am happy I did. It was certainly one of the most visually-stimulating fantasy-black comedies I have seen, since maybe 'Death Becomes Her.' The story of 'Dark Shadows' begins in the 18th century when the Collins family crossed the Atlantic to begin their fishing business in Maine. Love-struck maid Angelique (Eva Green) took a fancy to the Collins scion Barnabas (Johnny Depp). Her love remained unrequited though because Barnaby became enamored with sweet Josette (Bella Heathcote). With the traditional fury expected from a woman scorned, Angelique resorted to powerful black magic to kill Josette and turn Barnaby into a vampire. The main story picks up 200 years later in 1972, when Barnabas was released from his grave by a road crew. He not only meets the very dysfunctional current generation of Collins, he also meets Angelique again! It seems that this witch also survived the centuries past, and is now the CEO of the competitor fishing company, Angel Bay. So, will Angelique finally possess Barnabas' love? Or will the pretty doe-eyed governess Victoria (also Heathcote) succeed to win him back, where her look-alike Josette failed 200 years ago?A lot of the charm came from the cast who played their characters in this dark comedy so tongue-in-cheek, it was delightful. Johnny Depp, playing an undead character from 200 years ago waking up again in 1972, so funny as he encounters recent inventions. Eva Green, I have never seen her attack a role with this much ooomph and passion before. I have seen her before drably playing characters before in films like 'The Dreamers,' 'Kingdom of Heaven' and 'Casino Royale.' This turn as Angieis a high point in her acting career. I had never seen Bella Heathcote act in anything before, but I understand how Barnabas could be so mesmerized by her beauty. Of course it won't be a Tim Burton without Helena Bonham-Carter, and here she plays a trippy redhead psychiatrist. I do not always like her characters before, but here she is also so funny! The other supporting characters played by Michelle Pfeiffer, Jackie Earl Haley and the kids were not so remarkable. The character twist that involves the daughter Carolyn was so sudden and out-of-the-blue that it does not really contribute much to the improvement of the story.For me, the best feature of this film is its amazing look. The visual effects, costumes and set design were all top-notch. They set the mood and the period of the story very effectively. And the soundtrack of early 70s songs, beginning with 'Nights in White Satin' over the opening credits, wow! The song choices were unexpected, surprising and nostalgic at the same time. Despite my raves, I know this film will not really appeal to all sectors. I found out during the credits that this was based on a TV show. I had not see this since the series was from the late 60s so I would not know how faithful this film was to its inspiration. I enjoyed it a lot. I found it very well-conceptualized and well-executed, despite the shortcomings of the script. I must admit the derivative script is not really the highlight of this film. It seems it contains various elements which had been bits and pieces of several ghost and vampire films we have seen before. Much to my chagrin, the violent make- out scene and the final conversation on the cliff edge came straight out of the 'Twilight' films! However, the film as a whole was just very beautiful to watch, in a Gothic and eerie sort of way. Just don't expect too much, sit back and enjoy it!",7,15,37,10 May 2012
12 Strong," That Final Charge on Horseback Saved It All
","About a month after the NYC attacks of 9/11/2001, a 12-member US Army Green Berets code-named Operational Detachment Alpha 595 (ODA 595) were chosen to be sent on a covert mission to Afghanistan. As part of Task Force Dagger, they joined forces with General Abdul Rashid Dostum (Navid Negahban) of the Northern Alliance to reclaim key Taliban-held cities there.The members of ODA 595 all had to ride horses because of the inhospitable terrain and distance they needed to cover. This was no problem for their charismatic leader Capt. Mitch Nelson (Chris Hemsworth), who grew up on a ranch, but this was his first time in actual combat. The other members, like Cal Spencer (Michael Shannon), Sam Diller (Michael Pena), Ben Milo (Trevante Rhodes), Vern Michaels (Thad Luckinbill), etc, had to master their horse-riding skills overnight on top of their combat skills in order to keep up with their dangerously harrowing mission.When they get to Afghanistan, it took some time for the war action to get going, as our heroes still needed to acquaint themselves with their unfamiliar allies. While the intense battle scenes took us in the middle of the gunfire and explosions, there was point when the action actually became repetitive as we would see the same strategy of attack (get coordinates of the camp, launch airstrike to decimate the enemy, engage the remained on the ground) for all the Taliban encampments, with just a little dramatic variation here and there for the sake of distinction.The centerpiece battle scene however was only upon us by the final thirty minutes or so of the film. This was the grand charge of Nelson's ragtag troop ON HORSEBACK to attack the superior numbers and firepower of the Taliban troops. That was an elaborate but very well-executed battle sequence for which this film would be remembered for. It was certainly unique, exciting and exhilarating to watch, worth the whole price of admission in itself. This was a good war film even if the 12 Americans all seemed to lead charmed lives despite the overwhelming odds stacked against them. On the other hand, the Taliban were all portrayed as cruel religious fanatics, as there were scenes commenting on their inhumane beliefs and practices particular about women. A strong all-American patriotic sentiment swelled at the end, fully expected in a true to life story of modern heroism as this. 6/10.",6,11,31,18 January 2018
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Not the Spectacular Finale We Expected
","December 16, 2014Even for the past two installments of this film franchise, I have been wondering why the title is 'The Hobbit', when the main story had really been more about Dwarfs. In this film, the chief Dwarf Thorin Oakenshield and his internal conflict was the central plot around which the other stories revolved. Even the Elves Legolas and Tauriel had more scenes than our solitary hobbit, Bilbo Baggins. The only scenes Bilbo totally owned for himself were those in the last five minutes.Within the first 10 minutes, Smaug, the dragon who attacked Laketown at the end of Part 2, was already down and out of the story. For the rest of the 134 minutes running time of this film, we will be watching battle after battle among various armies trying to gain control of the massive trove of gold that Smaug left behind in his old lair in Erebor. Because Thorin was overcome with madness from 'dragon sickness', he refused to peacefully negotiate with the Humans (led by the Bard) and the Elves (led by Thranduil). This eventually leads to war -- a five-way battle along with two groups of vicious evil Orcs (led by Azog) and finally, the Great Eagles (with Radagast and Beorn). After the conclusion of the battle, Bilbo finally returns back to his home in Bag End after 11 years.If you have seen the past two episodes, the level of acting of the cast is basically the same. Nothing so spectacular, nothing so bad. Richard Armitage does very well in the lead role of Thorin. He imbues the character with dignity and honor, despite his initial turn to the dark side. Other actors who stood out were Aidan Turner as the lovestruck dwarf Kili, and Luke Evans as the Dragonslayer Bard. Aside from seeing Ian McKellen again, it was also good to see a lot of cameos from the original LOTR series, like Cate Blanchett, Hugo Weaving, Christopher Lee and Ian Holm.For a film that is basically all computer-generated effects, the quality of these effects in a lot of key scenes were rather disappointing. There was a scene of Dwarfs riding goats up a rocky mountain that really looked fake. The scene where Legolas hitched a ride on a bat in flight was snicker-inducing. The worst was the scene where Legolas was climbing up rocks as they were falling down from a crumbling bridge. The CG was so bad, it looked like Legolas was running up in thin air.Speaking from the point of view of a non-LOTR fanatic, this whole Hobbit film franchise could have been just one big film or maybe two. Even if it was interesting and engaging, the story felt too overstretched when director Peter Jackson decided to make it into a three film series. The expectations for a truly spectacular finale in this film was not really met fully because this had been marred by some poor visual effects. Despite this lengthy storytelling, this film felt a bit incomplete. There was no scene telling us the aftermath of the battle, nor the fate of the gold, which was the main cause of the war.I felt that the second film, 'The Desolation of Smaug' was the best of the trilogy. It had the best part of the story, the best action sequences and the best special effects of the three. Anyhow, the tying- in of certain details in this film to the first LOTR film though makes me want to watch that first series all over again. 6/10.",6,6,13,16 December 2014
Shooter," Good for Adrenaline Rush
","I had no idea what this film was about before I entered. It stars Marc Wahlberg playing a Marines sharpshooter veteran incredulously named Bob Lee Swagger. He was abandoned in the Ethiopia war zone by his superiors, so when he made his way back in the States, he becomes a loner. Sounds familiar??? Yes! This film could be the rehash of Rambo or any Chuck Norris movie of the 80s! There was definitely an 80s feel to it in the first few scenes.In this film, Swagger was recruited to help analyze and prevent an assassination attempt on the US President. However, it turns out he would be framed for the crime. Of course, he escapes this tight set-up and, despite two gunshot wounds, was able to tackle an FBI agent, steal his car, drive the car into the river, escape along the shore, hot-wire an abandoned car and make his way from Philadelphia to Kentucky! Of course this is just the start of a series of superhuman artillery exploits in the forests, in the fields, in the snow! It is very exciting for an action film. Big explosions everywhere. Characters are either one of two: 1. Too superhuman, as was Swagger, but also Sarah (Kate Mara) as the widow of Swagger's best friend, who was amazingly able to do bullet extraction surgery in her bedroom! Or 2. Too caricature, as were the over-the-top evil characters of Danny Glover, Elias Koteas and Ned Beatty. Of course, we don't expect Wahlberg (or anyone else for that matter) to earn his next Oscar nomination from this film.Finally, we only watch these kinds of films for the adrenaline rush, and for that, 'Shooter' still gets an average score.",6,1,4,8 May 2007
Inception," A Mutli-Layered Dream World
","What drew me to watch this film on the very first day of theatrical showing was the cast, which was an incredible array of some of the most intense actors in Hollywood today. We have Ken Watanabe, Cilian Murphy, Marion Cotillard, Michael Caine, Tom Berenger, Pete Postlethwait, and in the lead, none other than Leonardo di Caprio. The director and writer Christopher Nolan also comes with a very impressive oeuvre behind him, with 'Memento,' 'The Prestige,' and most recently, 'The Dark Knight.'This film is one of the most complicated films I have seen. A fair summary is almost impossible to put into words. It is challenging to follow all the jumping into and out of dreams, in dreams within dreams. I won't be surprised if you do not completely understand everything that was going on by the end. However, the visual experience of being in this multi-layered dream world is unmatchable in any recent films.I thought of 'The Matrix,' and even Leo's latest (excellent) work 'Shutter Island,' as this film proceeds to disorient you about what is and is not reality. However, 'Inception' goes several levels higher in the hierarchy of convolutions in film. There are at least four levels of simultaneous dream upon dream happening at one time at one point. Amazing film editing work!Then there are technical aspects which were mind-boggling indeed, as Nolan's bizarre script required. The audience is brought inside buildings, rooms, elevators, even entire cities where you lose the sense of space, time, gravity and logic. It is a dream world--you need to see it to fully appreciate what I just wrote. The musical score of Hans Zimmer was strong and dramatic. These are definitely contenders by Oscar time.This film is not for everyone. There are those who would dismiss this as impossibly pretentious and pointless. But for me, 'Inception' was very stimulating and challenging -- a film well-worthy to spend two and a half hours of our valuable time. Be ready to face this challenge when you go watch it. I won't be surprised if you feel you need to watch it all over again.",8,11,25,15 July 2010
Defiance," Potentially Good Story But Unfocused Execution
","This movie tells the story of a lesser known aspect of World War 2 in Eastern Europe, about the Bielski brothers, Tuvia, Zus, Asael and Aron. They were Belarussian Jews who were forced to hide out in the forests because Germans destroyed their village and massacred their families. There they end up leading more than a thousand other Jewish survivors to freedom. Their flight inevitably drew parallelisms to no less than the book of Exodus.I did not like the storytelling too much as it was too disjointed and episodic. The drama was not told in an emotionally involving way. There were scenes that show the Bielski group rob and kill German sympathizers. There was a scene where the Jews beat a captured German officer to death. There was scene where Tuvia led his band of Jews to cross a river. Then there was the climactic (bur unrealistic) scene where the Jews fight and win over a group of fully-armed Germans with a tank. Yet there seems to be no fluidity that bind these scenes together.The actors who played the Bielski brothers do not look like brothers at all. Daniel Craig, who played the idealistic eldest brother Tuvia, looked miscast to me in particular. He did not look like he belonged with the rest of the Jews he led. Liev Schrieber (as the more aggressive Zus) and Jamie Bell (as the young Asael) were more realistic and successful in their portrayal.Technically, the movie looked average and unrealistic. The art direction and make-up looked haphazard. The editing of the gun battles was erratic. Even the Oscar-nominated musical score was not really memorable. And the overall direction by Edward Zwick seemed without a unifying focus, wasting a potentially good storyline.",4,16,23,21 February 2009
Sherlock Holmes," Great Movie, Though It Isn't the Sherlock I Imagined
","From the trailer alone, I knew that Guy Ritchie's take on Arthur Conan Doyle's classic character Sherlock Holmes was a departure from what I had imagined this ace detective to be as I read his books. Of course, the keen eye for detail and the amazing powers of deduction Holmes is well-known for is there. But seeing Holmes shirtless, bare-knuckle boxing for money, and looking like Robert Downey Jr., was certainly not the image of Sherlock I had in mind.The lead cast is instrumental in bringing this film to vivid life. Robert Downey Jr. recreates the role of Sherlock Holmes and made it his own. His delivery of those witty one-liners are too funny. Jude Law is very good in his portrayal of the fastidious Dr. Watson. He also isn't exactly what I imagined Watson to be, but is close enough. Their chemistry together is impeccable, very effective in driving this film forward.However, I did not really like the main supporting cast. Rachel Mc Adams, I do not really like this actress since 'The Notebook', and I think she wasted the Irene Adler character. Mark Strong as the main villain Lord Blackwood, had a strong and sinister face on close-ups, but his overall appearance and bearing in full body shots were not imposing enough to conjure fear in the audience.Nonetheless, this was a very good movie. The script was interesting, humorous and intelligent. The action sequences were exciting and well-executed. They made good use of computer imagery to recreate Victorian London and the diabolical mysteries afoot. Overall, this was a very good mainstream effort by Guy Ritchie. He had succeeded to transform the cerebral Sherlock of old into a brawny blockbuster hero fit for these hyperactive times.",7,0,0,21 January 2010
WALL·E," A Space Odyssey Animated Adaptation
","This will just be a quickie review since I only watched this film during a plane ride (but I was seated rather far from the screen). In the beginning, there were long stretches without dialogue when Wall-E was still on the barren earth. The action and my attention only picked up when the human form was finally seen on screen. And when we see the humans of that time, we see lazy obese creatures who could not even get up from their automatic car beds. This was really a funny yet disturbing view of a future where the computer all but takes over human thoughts and actions. I can clearly see the homage to '2001: A Space Odyssey,' with the Master Computer and all. The message in the end to take care of our planet is universal and encouraging. The excellent quality of the film is very apparent despite the less than ideal way I was watching it. The romance between Wall-E and Eve, while obviously there, I must admit I did not really get all the nuances in this viewing. After all the plaudits I have read about Wall-E on this site, I really should get a DVD and watch this more carefully soon.",7,0,2,27 November 2008
The Good Shepherd," An interminable complex dirge
","I know that this is a well-reviewed movie, but sad to say, I did not like it. It simply tried to cover so many things. There were so many supporting characters (Robert de Niro, Alec Baldwin, Michael Gambon, Joe Pesci, etc) who seem to indistinctively blend into each other. There were too many subplots going on, and they were not shown in sequence. I know I should get used to this film technique by now. However, since the main character Edward Sr. (Matt Damon) did not age physically throughout the movie, it was more confusing. You know that more than 20 years have passed since Damon's son Edward Jr. was shown from his childhood to his wedding day. But when the son was an adult (played by Eddie Redmayne) already, Damon still looked like an elder brother. Angelina Jolie looked hopelessly miscast and uncomfortable as the wife.The film was very slow-paced, it felt like it was never going to end. It just went on and on, jumping from the 40s to the 60s featuring Edward Sr. and various characters in his life. There were only sporadic interesting subplots that catch your attention, but they were few and far between. The only likable character it seems is hearing-impaired girlfriend Laura (played by Tammy Blanchard). There was that very original scene on an airplane with Edward Jr.'s fiancÃ©e. And the interesting CSI-like investigation of a piece of film, done with period technology.But as a whole, for me, this whole movie felt like an interminable complex dirge--very draining to watch and not worth the long 167 minutes of time spent on it.",4,1,6,24 February 2007
The Blind Side," 'Precious' in a More Positive Light
","One of my favorite actresses finally gets a Golden Globe Best Actress award, and most likely an Oscar nomination will follow, with a role in this movie. So with that incentive, I went and sought out to watch Sandra Bullock in 'The Blind Side.' This movie is a true story about an abandoned black gentle-giant teenager Michael Oher adopted by a wealthy white Southern family, the Tuohys. It is a story that is pushing the boundaries of racial relations. It is amazing in that this unlikely story actually happened in real life. A fictional story like this could potentially be offensive. However, with genial storytelling and the general good will of the stars, a warm feel-good message is sent across to the audience. I personally felt that this movie is like 'Precious', in an infinitely more positive and watchable, albeit somewhat sugar-coated, light.Sandra Bullock is very much herself here in the role of Leigh Anne Tuohy. I do not really see anything special that she did to merit awards consideration. She is her reliable good-natured persona that made her star since 'Speed'. But that said, I am glad that she is recognized for her fine work. The other members of the cast were also very good. I did not recognize country star Tim McGraw without his hat, but he held his own against Sandra. The youngest Touhy kid is scene-stealing cute without verging into annoying. The actor who played Michael is well-cast, a charming embodiment of the meek yet tough character.For the general local audience unfamiliar with American football, these scenes may be lost on most of us. They did try to explain in layman's terms what the left offensive tackle (Michael's position on the football team) does. The actual cameo appearances of real American college football coaches will certainly be lost to us as well. However, the very heart and soul message of the movie, that of helping out the less fortunate among us despite social repercussions, will surely reverberate.",8,1,2,19 January 2010
Rango," Not for Kids, Not Exactly A Good Time
","'Rango' tells about a lonely pet chameleon with an active imagination who was one day suddenly thrown off his owner's car, and into the real world. His tall tales of deadly exploits make him the sheriff of a lawless rundown town of Dust in the Mojave Desert, which was having a water crisis. When the bad guys steal their last five days supply of water, Rango must now walk his talk and apprehend the bandits.This was a very strange animated movie. I do not think this was for kids at all. The theme and story were very mature, even the language (with minor cuss words). The drawings are not at all what we would traditionally call 'nice.' The characters were all not exactly pleasant little critters of the desert. There were scenes of hard drinking, cigar smoking, gun violence, morbid hangings and even a rather raunchy scene with a naked Barbie torso. I don't know if they thought the image of a armadillo gored in the midriff still talking was supposed to be funny.Rango himself is written and illustrated in a very irritating way. It was uncomfortable to look at him or those stupid things he was doing. It was as if Mr. Bean became a lizard. I don't know if knowing that it was Johnny Depp voicing Rango would really help. The lead female character Beans (voiced by Isla Fisher) looked like a creature from 'Avatar,' but I have no idea what animal she was supposed to have been. Those momentary spells where she would blank out were more disturbing than funny. There were some good points too in this Gore Verbinski film. The cameo tributes to Westerns were good, like Morricone's music and Clint Eastwood. The villains were seriously well-written, especially the oily Mayor (Ned Beatty) and the scary Jake (Bill Nighy). There were some pretty witty one-liners throughout the script. While ugly, the details in the animal characters is admittedly intricate and shows a lot of hard work by the animators. Still overall though, I would not exactly call watching 'Rango' a good time.",5,3,8,19 March 2011
The Conjuring," Intense Malevolence!
","'The Conjuring' had its sneak preview in local theaters today, opening with a lot of hype. I am happy to report that all the hype about this film being one of the scariest horror films in recent years is totally true. And that assessment comes from a horror film fan like myself.This movie was set in 1971, when the Perron family composed of Roger, Carolyn and their five daughters, moved into a rundown country house in an isolated area in Rhode Island. Almost immediately, strange events begin to happen to them. The ghostly manifestations started benignly, with creaky opening doors to unexplained bruising. As days passed, the attacks become increasingly violent and physical.Carolyn desperately sought the help of noted supernatural investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren. What they discover in the Perron home is a dark spirit more hateful than anything they have encountered before. They need to work against time before deadly events that had previously occurred in the house could happen again. In this extraordinary case, the Warrens needed to resort to the most extreme measures they know in order to save the tormented familyUnlike other film boasting about being based on a true story, this one actually convinces you that the horrific events shown in it happened in real life. A lot of this was due to the very authentic production design bringing us back to the early 1970s. The musical choices were atmospherically apt and creepy.There was also the topnotch acting from the cast, which is unusual for a horror movie. The expertise and compassion of Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga, who played the Warrens, felt very realistic. The chemistry between them is incredibly palpable. Ron Livingston, Lili Palmer and the five young actresses who play the Perron daughters all played well as the victimized family. I would not be surprised if Vera Farmiga and Lili Palmer pick up acting nominations for their performances.Director James Wan throws every horror gimmick at us here but still makes everything felt remarkably fresh and original. There was some welcome humor to lighten some of the intense dread and tension that builds up within the film which will make you squirm in your seats. The deliberately slow pace felt interminably long in some eerie scenes which can definitely creep most people out. The editing of the film was very effective in this regard.There were some questionable aspects though. The poster and even the pre-credits scene will make you expect something, but the rest of the movie was totally about something else. There was a subplot about Ed and Lorraine's daughter which was very well-executed with some of the film's scariest scenes, but this ultimately led nowhere, except maybe a possible sequel, which is something I would look forward to.",8,0,1,12 August 2013
Prometheus," A Very Unscientific Science-Fiction Movie
","In the year 2089, a couple of archaeologists(?) Holloway (Logan Marshall Green) and Shaw (Noomi Rapace) find pictograms in various caves and ancient temples that suggested alien origins of human life in a faraway star system. They earn the sponsorship of old trillionaire Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce in atrocious old-age make-up) to launch a 2-year expedition with more scientists to travel to that planet in a vessel called 'Prometheus' to study it and search for these 'engineers' of the human race. They get more than what they bargained for as the crew members, as well as the very existence of Earth itself, were threatened by the aliens they encounter there. Can the crew of the Prometheus escape this alien threat that they have unleashed upon themselves?The set decoration, cinematography, editing, sound and visual effects are by all means top-notch under the direction of veteran Ridley Scott. This is certainly a beautiful film to watch. However, the utter disregard for any scientific principles of research investigation and medicine is really very distracting. These scientists in this crew do not follow very basic scientific procedures. Would you really remove your helmet in an unknown atmosphere just because your equipment says it is safe? Would you do an autopsy of an alien head with your face mask hanging around your neck? Could you get up and run right after a bloody do-it-yourself Caesarean operation? Would the DNA of the ancient 'engineers' still EXACTLY MATCH with human DNA after all these years without any mutation? There simply too many mind-boggling questions. Was that breath-taking opening shot of a volcanic lake supposed to be Earth? When that white alien drank the black stuff, his DNA was seen mutating in the water, what then? Could an android (Michael Fassbender) really be deceitful, and why would he be? What is the point of Charlize Theron's icy character Vickers? Even the epilogue puzzles with even more questions. The way that last alien looked with the big horn on its head felt totally forced, and obviously shoehorned to coincide with the original 'Alien' movie, also created and directed by Ridley Scott. So overall, this movie is just OK. It is indeed a visual spectacle, but the story development leaves so much to be desired. Some movies you could enter and leave your brain checked at the door, but not this one. In this type of movie, you will expect some scientific credibility in order for it to work. Unfortunately, 'Prometheus' fails in that regard.",6,6,14,7 June 2012
Despicable Me," Loved the Touching Parts More
","I watched the 2D version of 'Despicable Me' with my kids this afternoon. The trailers were not really very good or enticing for me to be excited about it. It was honestly quite a mixed bag for me.The story involved a super villain named Gru whose status was threatened by a nerdy upstart named Vector, who upped the evil ante by stealing the Great Pyramid of Egypt. (Is it my imagination or is Vector a dig at Bill Gates?) Anyway, to top that heist, Gru plots on stealing the Moon itself. To do that, Gru saw the need to adopt three orphan girls, named Margo, Edith and Agnes, in order to infiltrate Vector's lair. Initially, harsh and compassion-less towards the children, Gru eventually warms up and ends up actually caring for the kids. But can his love for the kids triumph over his obsession to be the top villain in the world? The initial scenes building up the story was too slow for me. In fact my wife and I both confessed to have dozed off in these parts. However, for me the fun and action begins when Gru went to adopt the girls. I liked the movie the most when it showed heart, and the developing love and sense of fatherhood of Gru towards the kids. Those two bedtime story reading scenes were the highlights of the whole film for me. The whole rivalry thing with Vector was not too good for me, mostly owing to the 'blah' way Vector was rendered and written.The comedy could be too rude (like how Gru acted during his interview with Ms. Hattie of the orphanage), or even gruesome (like red stuff coming out of a spiked box when a girl gets caught inside). However, when the movie tones down its hyperactivity and cranks up the human drama, I can't help but be very much touched by these scenes. Gru's scenes with Little Agnes (who positively loved fluffy unicorns!) were all executed to tear-jerking perfection.The voice acting by Steve Carrell was also instrumental for us to actually root for Gru despite his initial villainy. I was very surprised to see at the end that it was no less than Ms. Julie Andrews who voiced the funny character of Gru's mother. The voices of the three girls, especially the very cute Agnes, were very well rendered. The yellow blob-like Minions of Gru were also portrayed very cutely (but what are they, really?).Compared to the excellent animated films so far seen this year, which included 'Toy Story 3' and 'How to Train Your Dragon,' 'Despicable Me' falls behind in my opinion. The start may be quite annoying and uninteresting, however investing more time to watch will make this rather brash comedy prove to be a most heart-warming adventure instead.",7,4,8,10 September 2010
1408," A Perplexing Torturous Trip!
","This is as close to a one-man show as we can get. John Cusack really goes through the gamut of human attitudes and emotions in this one film. For me, it is a convincing tour-de-force acting performance. He really gets into the skin of his character and rides the storyline all the way through the roller coaster from hell, from its benign beginning to its heart-stopping twists and turns, up to its fiery end. He plays Mike Enslin, a writer who debunks popular haunted places. He gets challenged to stay at Rm. 1408 of the Dolphin Hotel in New York City by an anonymous postcard. He couldn't resist the dare, so he thwarted all efforts to stop him from staying for a night. Needless to say, his life turns 360 degrees after the manager leaves him in the fated room. The evil spirit of the room, along with ghosts of the room's past victims, as well as Enslin's own personal ghosts regarding his daughter who died of cancer, all join forces to torment him and torture him both physically, mentally and emotionally.After this movie, you will never hear 'We've Only Just Begun' by the Carpenters the same way again. This sweet song actually became creepy! The movie never loses focus. Very exciting. Tight, very well-edited. There's a strange bit at the end with Samuel L. Jackson's hotel manager character in a perplexing scene. But then the whole movie is one big perplexing trip, you don't really notice.",7,0,0,26 September 2007
Step Up," Great Dance Scenes!
","'Step Up' is not really a movie you watch for the story. It's totally predictable and definitely you've seen all these scenes and situations in many other movies before. It is not even about the actors (I did not know any names of the leads, nor do I recall them right now). It is something you watch because of the great dance sequences. I especially enjoyed watching 2 scenes: the romantically shot dance sequence on the rooftop, bathed in afternoon sunlight; and that climactic dance sequence in the 'showdown', very well choreographed and executed. There was a scene with the male lead danced with his foster siblings, which I found charming. The hiphop soundtrack is also very good. That song in the final credits 'Get Up' by Ciara is very infectious, I'm having last song syndrome up to now.",6,0,2,5 October 2006
The Woman in Black," Thankful for a Good Horror Film!
","I am a fan of the horror genre. However lately, American horror films have really deteriorated in quality, either they are rip-offs of Asian horror films or more of violent and gory 'Saw' or 'Final Destination'- type films. As the poster and stills of this film promises a return to the old fashioned Gothic horror film, I made sure I watched this.Set in Victorian England, 'The Woman in Black' is about a young lawyer Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe) who had been assigned to a remote village to fix the papers regarding a certain estate. However, Kipps notes that many children are dying mysterious deaths, and the people seem to blame him for it. Are the deaths of the children related to the mysterious abandoned estate he is working on or the 'woman in black' he sees lurking in its shadows?From the ominous first scenes, we know this film would be special. I am pretty sure that a word that many reviewers will use to this describe this film is 'ATMOSPHERIC.' The creepy atmosphere that director James Watkins successfully achieves for this film is excellent. It will completely absorb you and bring you into that haunted village and house right along with Arthur Kipps. Yes, there were the usual jump scare techniques, but they were used to great effect. You will gasp in spite of yourself. The use of porcelain-faced dolls and wind-up toys may be old, but still very effectively used to further enhance the scariness of the scenes. Daniel Radcliffe does very well here. I did have a hard time accepting him as a young father at first, as his Harry Potter persona is still very fresh in our memories. Overall, I liked this film very much. I thought I was already jaded after all those horror films I had seen before. This film still succeeded to give me genuine chills and jumps. The gloomy weather, desolate marshy location and antique set design were on point for creating the perfect atmosphere for dread. Okay, this is not at the level of 'Sixth Sense' or 'The Others', but it is definitely a step in the right direction as far as the horror genre is concerned. Despite a few illogical scenes (what ghost story film isn't without them?), I will whole-heartedly recommend this film for horror movie fans.",8,1,4,9 February 2012
X-Men: First Class," An Excellent Must-Watch Prequel to the X-Men Saga
","Another Marvel X-Men film, another excellent summer blockbuster! Of all the characters in the Marvel universe, I find the X-Men to be the most interesting of all. This story which explores the beginnings of not just one, but the two most powerful senior X-Men can certainly do no wrong. At first, I was worried about this film being a teenage movie with a lot of teenage angst going on. Wrong. This film is a very mature treatment of the close friendship that developed between the brainy privileged Charles Xavier and the troubled angry Erik Lensherr, and how they forged the beginning of the mutant organization on Earth. We are brought into the Cold War and the Cuban missile crisis as the historical backdrop of this story. The main antagonist is the mad and greedy Dr. Sebastian Shaw who also has his own army of mutants. The acting of the cast was also faultless, led by James McAvoy (as Charles) and Michael Fassbender (as Erik). As can be predicted, the turn of Erik to the Dark Side was the more intense character arc, but the Charles angle was not left weak. There was a touching subplot featuring Raven (Mystique) and Hank (Beast) about mutant appearances, which actors Jennifer Lawrence and Nicholas Hoult also portrayed very well. Veteran Kevin Bacon does his slimy best as maniacal Dr. Shaw, with the help of the sexy January Jones as the icy Emma Frost.This type of movie, being a prequel, is the type where the beginning and middle are more interesting than the end, which we already know what happens beforehand. I loved how they tied everything up very neatly in the details about each character we all know very well. Director Matthew Vaughn navigates the main story and its subplots into one coherent, entertaining and exciting whole. Bryan Singer, director of the first two (and best two) X-Men movies, is also on board here as one of the writing team. Awesome special effects complete this overall excellent package. A must watch, most certainly!",9,3,7,9 June 2011
Fifty Shades of Grey," Dubious Domination
","'Fifty Shades of Grey' is a very popular 2011 erotic novel that dealt with a sexual relationship marked by domination and submission. It started as 'Twilight' fanfiction written by British author E.L. James on her website. It later gained viral status as an e-book, leading to a best-selling print publication and worldwide notoriety as 'mommy porn.' Now, it had gone one step further and has been brought to life on the silver screen. Of course, controversy continued to hound this film production, starting from the casting choices for the lead roles, which were never popular with the fans. Locally there was a lot of talk about censorship with 'blurs and blocks', despite the fact that it had already been rated R-18. (While in France, I saw that this film had been incredibly rated as R-12.) Of course, all this media hullabaloo resulted in more audience curiosity. Despite scathingly bad reviews when it opened on Valentine's Day, this film pulled in a startling box-office haul of $95M in its first weekend alone. Against my better judgement, I simply had to see what the fuss was all about.Anastasia Steele is a college student majoring in English Literature. When she met young business tycoon Christian Grey, she was attracted to his strength of character and the mystery of his person. Mr. Grey, likewise taken by Ana's charm and innocence, pursued her with gifts, from first editions of Thomas Hardy novels to rides on the company helicopter. However, when the virginal Ana was falling in love with Grey, she would discover that he was not into the traditional romantic affair she was expecting. His 'thing' was sexual domination and submission, as proved by the array of whips, chains and cuffs he had in his 'playroom.' Will Ana willingly submit to this man's perverse idea of a relationship?The topic of sexual domination and submission in itself is not palatable to most tastes, including mine. To be fair, the film had been careful in showing that there was consent as far as Ana's concerned when it came to sexual activities. The screenplay is based on the book, so the shortcomings of the book are the same shortcomings of the film, when it comes to cheesy situations and lines. As far the sex scenes were concerned, this film paled in comparison with 'Basic Instinct' or '9 1/2 Weeks' when it comes to erotic danger and urgency. To add further damper, the 'blocks' the local distributors employed to protect the eyes Filipino audience from prurience were so ugly. Sometimes these black blocks would occupy an entire half of the wide screen! Anyway, these unsightly 'blocks' aside, I think the boring depiction of sex in this film was because the actors playing Ana and Christian did not have any chemistry between them. I thought Jamie Dornan was woefully miscast as Christian Grey. Physically, he was not tall and imposing enough. Attitudinally, he did not look dominant or confident enough. In fact, he looked awkward in a lot of scenes. He did not look like he was having any pleasure at all with what he was doing. Stripped down to basics, this main conflict of this film was Christian fighting the romantic love he was feeling for Ana in order to fulfill his domination fetish. Dornan could not effectively get this across. With all the staring that Grey had to do, I also get distracted with Dornan's right eye, which bulged bigger than the left.In contrast, Dakota Johnson (daughter of Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith) was able to convey the conflicts in her character quite well, I thought. She was in love and at the same time intimidated by Grey. She had more nude scenes than Dornan, which was ironic for a film targeted for a female audience. I guess this was done for the benefit of the husbands and boyfriends who will be 'forced' by their wives and girlfriends to watch this with them. She did show acting talent here, so I hope doing this film will not stagnate her career.With its slick-looking production design and a killer pop soundtrack, this film is not the total bore it was made out to be. Ironically for a major Valentine release however, the relationship we see in this film is romance-less, thrill-less and loveless. Even if audiences knew what the film was going to be about when they go in to watch this, many will still be repelled, disturbed or disgusted by the aberrant and abusive sexual behavior they see on screen.",4,0,3,18 February 2015
The Wolverine," A Movie With So Much Angst
","'The Wolverine' begins with a scene at the end of World War II with the bombing of Nagasaki. Under such harsh circumstances, Logan (Hugh Jackman) strikes a friendship with a Japanese soldier, Yashida (Ken Yamamura). Fast forward to the present time, Yashida (now played by Haruhito Yamanouchi), now the taipan of a big business enterprise (on his amazing futuristic deathbed), summons Logan to Japan to say his parting words before he dies. When he gets there though, Logan got more than what he bargained for, as his very immortality lay on the line.Hugh Jackman is the perfect Wolverine. By now, we all know looks the part and acts the part from previous X-Men films, and this film is no different. Logan will experience something new from this film that challenges him like never before, and Jackman was more than able to project that challenge. We will feel his pain. He carried this heavy film like no other actor could.Logan will have two Japanese ladies behind him. First is Mariko (the beautiful Tao Okamoto), the statuesque granddaughter and future heir of the Yashida fortune. Second is Yukio (the anime-cute Rila Fukushima), a quirky red-haired ward of Yashida who was also a very able fighter. Both ladies performed very well in their respective roles.This film is a very heavy drama with occasional bursts of exciting action. Some fans looking forward to nonstop slash fights may be disappointed. The best fight scene was that one on the roof of the bullet train, and that happens in the first hour. I also enjoyed all the well-orchestrated Japanese-style sword fights and archery scenes, but these were fewer than I expected.Save for a brief scene about a bath near the start, there was absolutely no relief from the overwhelming angst that pervades this movie. Everybody was frowning or angry almost the whole time. And this film lasts for more than two hours. Some viewers may find all this rage too much to bear.I found this a very well-made film by Director James Mangold. I liked the intense Wolverine it painted. I liked the Japanese setting and cultural references. I liked the artsy scenes featuring Famke Janssen as Jean Grey. I really like the extra scene during the final credits, now that is really exciting. However, as a whole the tone may have been too turgid or intense to be considered entertaining. Fans should go watch it as it is a very good film, but do not expect it to be as commercial as the other X-Men films for the average moviegoers. 7/10.",7,6,19,25 July 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," A True EPIC!
","'The Dark Knight Rises' is an EPIC superhero movie. This in fact could potentially be an unprecedented award-winning superhero movie. The two and a half hours that was needed to tell this huge story were wisely used. The film was absorbing and the details were all vital. The photography, the visual effects, the crowd scenes, the stunts, the Bat vehicles were all AWESOME to watch, and that was only on Digital 2D. It is a practically an impossible task to compress the span of the complicated screenplay into a single paragraph. The story basically picks up eight years after revered Gotham City District Attorney Harvey Dent was assumed to have been murdered by the Batman. Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) had been leading a hermit existence since then, and the Batman had been unheard of. The arrival of a revolutionary respirator-masked super-villain named Bane (a massive and unrecognizable Tom Hardy) that shattered peace in Gotham City knocks sense into Bruce Wayne/Batman to come out of his retirement. Question is, does he still have what it takes to defeat Bane and save Gotham?Interwoven into this saga are other very loyal old characters like the Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman), Alfred (Michael Caine), Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), and very interesting new characters like idealistic policeman John Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), the enigmatic Miranda Tate (Marion Cotillard) and the complicated Selina Kyle/Catwoman (an unexpectedly perfect portrayal by Anne Hathaway). Each of these characters are integral to the main story. In fact, all of these other characters practically spend the same amount of screen time as the main Bat. Yet, no one felt superfluous at all. Even the cameo of Liam Neeson as Ra's Al Ghul was important.This is indeed the BEST movie I have seen so far in 2012! It would be an injustice if this movie and its visionary director Christopher Nolan would not be nominated come Oscar time. This was worth the wait, the hype and the excitement. Despite the closure, the hint of a sequel makes the already perfect ending that additional punch. This is one helluva kick-ass action film, yet it does not lose the angst, the drama and the heart. The Batman is still the best DC character out there, and this film certainly shows us why!",10,7,22,19 July 2012
The Croods," A Touching Ode to Fatherhood
","I honestly did not want to watch 'The Croods.' The ugly title and the crude way the characters were drawn did not really appeal to me. I kept trying to defer it when my kids were asking to watch it. Well, for a lazy Sunday afternoon at the mall like today with nothing specific to do, there was no more excuse or escape for this dad to delay the inevitable.'The Croods' was about the last Neanderthal caveman family on Earth who were forced to get out of the cave that had kept them safe all these years when the mountains around them began to crumble down. With the help of a young inventive caveman named Guy, they follow the sun and venture into the big wide unknown, seeking to escape the destruction of the world they knew. On this journey, the Crood patriarch Grug faces his biggest dilemma as a father when his established way of keeping his family together and safe is challenged by the 'modern' ideas of Guy, as well as the shifting continental land masses.It took time for me to get into the groove of the story. The superhuman abilities of the Croods as well as the incredibly strange flora and fauna around them were simply too unbelievable and weird. Once I got that initial resistance out of the way, I not only had a very good time laughing at their hilarious antics, I was also very personally touched by the situation experienced by Grug as head of his family, now facing the ultimate threat for their very existence.The technical excellence of this film is unquestionable. OK, I did not really like how the Croods looked, but hey they ARE cavemen anyhow. However the artwork and cinematography of the world around them was breathtaking. The visual effects, grand or minute, dealing with water, or dust, or tar were so realistic. The voice work by Nicolas Cage for Grug is so good, gruff but sincere. Emma Stone as the rebellious daughter Eep, Ryan Reynolds as Guy and Ms. Cloris Leachman as the grandmother also turn in remarkable work. Like several Dreamworks animated films before this one, namely 'Shrek', 'How to Train Your Dragon' and 'Megamind', I was initially turned off by the non-traditional, OK non-Disney, looks of the artwork. But after hearing much positive word of mouth, I gave them a chance and watched them. Of course, I appreciate them as the excellent films that they are. I now add 'The Croods' to that list. I should really learn my lesson and stop judging them by the way they look in the trailer.",8,0,0,7 April 2013
Iron Man," Very Long Back Story Here.... But I'm Excited for the Sequel!
","I knew the old comic book character of Iron Man, but I was not at all that familiar with the back story. This movie is a complete history of the origins of Iron Man. All you need to know about Tony Stark the man in the first few minutes. Then they went into extensive details on how he developed and perfected Iron Man. It was this part that dragged a bit for me. I just felt this went on a little too long. This protracted phase of the movie makes it NOT kid-friendly.The production design was excellent. It was great to see the prototypes of the Iron Man costume before he decided on the final sleek look with the red metal. Stark's cliff-side house and sports cars looked great, and of course, his assistant Pepper Potts (an uncharacteristic yet memorable comeback by Gwyneth Paltrow) and his other girlfriends also looked great.I was a skeptic when I first found out that Robert Downey Jr. would be playing Tony Stark, aka Iron Man. He just did not fit the superhero type, nor the millionaire genius playboy type of Stark. Contrary to popular sentiment, even after I watched, I still found it hard to accept Downey in this character in most of the film. The last scene, though, in the press conference, was a scene that somehow seems only a character like Robert Downey Jr. can pull off. I loved that scene and made me optimistic about the sequel.As for Jeff Bridges, it was great to see him back in great form and looking so different. Debit is that you can see right through him from the start even if you did not have any background of the storyline in the comics. His character Obadiah Stane was very transparent and shallowly written.Nevertheless, the flying and fighting action sequences were breathtakingly shot and very exciting to watch. They were all fast-paced and realistic. The CGI was not obviously evident. I felt though, that the finale battle with his rival giant robot Iron Monger seemed so anti-climactic. His final victory was quite unconvincing because Iron Man even had to ask for Pepper's help. Huh??? Overall it is a good enough movie, especially for a first in an apparently planned series. They had to spend a lot of time establish the character first in this installment, OK understood. Hopefully the sequel can give us more of the action we seek, since the back story is out of the way. Can't wait for the next one!",6,1,4,15 May 2008
Monsters University," 'Revenge of the Nerds' Animated Version
","Pixar's latest offering 'Monsters University' is a prequel to their 2000 smash hit 'Monsters Inc.' In this installment, we are brought back in time, when our favorite monster heroes: Mike (the green walking ball with one Cyclops eye, voiced by Billy Crystal) and Sully (the blue shaggy giant with the polka dotted arms, voiced by John Goodman) were just freshmen students at Monsters U, where they were enrolled in the 'Scaring' program. We see how they first met, their classes, their professors, Randy the lizard, their fraternity. As a bonus, we also see Monsters Inc., linking this with the first film.Mainly, the film will showcase the 'Greek Scare Games', an annual scaring competition where Greek societies battle to be the 'most fearsome monsters on campus'. This competition will forge as well as challenge Mike and Sully's friendship, as our heroes discover more about each other and about themselves while going through the various events.Beautiful may not really be the correct word to describe the artwork here, but let's just say that the artists were given their free hand to make the most imaginative and colorful monsters they can come up with. All the scenes in the monster world were bursting with bright colors and wacky designs, it was just lively to behold. The sprawling University campus itself looked like it was inspired by Harvard and its hallowed halls. In contrast, the scenes in the human world were drab and harsh, emphasizing the danger faced by the monsters in our world.The story of 'Monsters University' though is very reminiscent of so many other films chronicling the battle of the 'losers' versus the 'cool kids' in college. Oozma Kappa, their fraternity of odd geeks and outsiders, reminded me of Lambda Lambda from 'Revenge of the Nerds'. The two emcees of the Scare Games reminded me of 'Pitch Perfect' and its acapella singing competition. Their terrifying dragon-formed Dean Hardscrabble reminded me a lot about Harry Potter's Professor Snape. However, what this film did keep intact is the heart that the original 'Monsters Inc.' was known for, extolling friendship, cooperation, loyalty and fair play.Overall, this is another solid animated feature by Pixar. Like other Pixar films, this was funny, with just the right amount of emotion and moral lesson in it. The movie is very entertaining for the whole family, but maybe more for the kids and the kids at heart. However, the story line is too familiar and derivative to be really distinct, much unlike the innovative first film, which had a very original and mature story. You will definitely have a good time while watching the monsters and their shenanigans, but you may not even really remember it too well anymore after a while.After the lackluster 'Cars 2,' I was a bit disappointed that 'Monsters University' turned out to be another rather lightweight entry, relative to all the other illustrious Pixar films, that is. With reports of a 'Finding Nemo' sequel in the works, I do hope Pixar can soon come up with another ground-breaking ORIGINAL story to bring back them back to their glory days. 6/10.",6,0,2,25 June 2013
Casino Royale," James Bond is Back!
","Vesper Lynd: Am I going to have a problem with you, Bond? James Bond: No, don't worry. You're not my type. Vesper Lynd: Smart? James Bond: Single.This is just one of the many smart and naughty verbal exchanges in this fantastic Bond film! I heartily recommend Casino Royale for all of you to watch and enjoy! There are so many unique scenes that were shot with great technique. Those early scenes in Madagascar construction site are a grade of their own. The very exciting sequence at the Miami airport is heart-stopping. The super-sensitive shower scene is previously unseen in other Bond films. The poker games were very exciting even when they were just seated around a table. James Bond is truly back! Daniel Craig has recreated this icon. Very rough and tumble and vicious. Very realistic! Surely Pierce Brosnan cannot do this particular Bond.",9,4,8,23 November 2006
Toy Story 3," As much now as it was then, Toy Story 3 is a masterpiece!
","We say it Pixar film after Pixar film, and here it is again: 'Pixar does it again!' 'Toy Story 3' successfully continues the Pixar tradition of excellence in animation and film story-telling that began 15 years ago with the first 'Toy Story.' I don't know how they do it but the excellent screenwriters was able to shake up the old 'Toy Story' themes of abandonment, friendship and loyalty into this wonderful script bursting with fresh humor, exciting action and above all, rich and heart-warming emotion. Never mind that we were watching toys on screen, but these characters were as real as people we hold dear. We are drawn into their dilemmas and we root for them to find their salvation.That hyper-exciting nail-biting scene in the garbage-disposal facility is a masterpiece in suspense. I was in awe at the vivid and highly complex sequence of animation on screen. When I looked at my 8 year old son beside me, he too was in total awe. It was amazing.If the last Pixar film 'Up' made us cry in the first 10 minutes, I think there was no dry eye in the theater (especially adults) in the last 10 minutes of 'Toy Story 3'. The sincerity of the dialogue and the highly charged execution was beautiful. Even that final catch in Andy's breath as he finally drove off to college was so intense with emotion.The voice acting was pitch perfect, especially Tom Hanks and Tim Allen who got Woody and Buzz down pat. The new duo of Ken (voiced by Michael 'Batman' Keaton) and Barbie (voiced by Jodi 'Little Mermaid' Benson) was very funny.What more superlatives can I write to convince you to watch this special film? It is a contender for the top spot in many a fan's Pixar favorite lists. It will surely be in contention for the Oscar (even for Best Picture) at year's end. DO NOT MISS THIS PIXAR MASTERPIECE!",10,2,4,20 June 2010
Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs," Cute Journey to the Land of the Lost
","My boys and I saw this movie in 2D. I did not really see any scene that I felt would have looked better in 3D. While I'm sure it would look better in 3D, but I suspect not by much.In this third installment, Manny the Mammoth and his gang make a journey to the center of the earth where they discover a lost world where dinosaurs still rule. We have seen this story many times before. The only thing that carries this story forward are the cute characters and their staunch friendship with each other. The dialogues are quite funny. The art work is commendable with its sense of depth and texture, as before. The action scenes (especially that one with Sid sledding in the snow grappling with three dinosaur eggs) were very well-executed.The new character, a swashbuckling weasel named Buck was cutely heroic, but I felt I have seen this character many times before in other animated films. Not very original again, including his eye patch. There were a lot of mushy love scenes of Scrat and his female partner. However, treating this situation as a love triangle with the Acorn was comedic genius for me ('Alone Again Naturally, haha!) Some scenes would seem very scary for kids like the meat-eating dinosaurs coughing out entire animals they had eaten, small raptors attacking Ellie while she was in labor or any scene with the giant white dinosaur named Rudy.",6,0,3,5 July 2009
La Vie En Rose," Comparing this Film about Piaf to a Play about Piaf
","I have long heard of this film, since it had won the Oscar Best Actress prize for lead actress Marion Cotillard for her total embodiment of the central character, French singer Edith Piaf. Oddly though, I never really got to watch this movie until now. It was only because I had just seen an amazing stage production called 'Piaf,' a play written by Pam Gems in 1978. This play introduced me to Piaf as a most dramatic and tragic character. I felt compelled to finally watch this movie 'La Vie en Rose' and compare notes.Thankfully for the play, I was able to get the flow of the whole story, despite the technique employed by the film director Olivier Dahan of telling her story non-linearly, in erratic flashbacks. Some of the flashbacks would inexplicably merge into main story which may confuse a lot of viewers who have no knowledge of Piaf's life story. If you knew how the story goes in the first place though, his story telling style choices may actually come across as artistic. Unlike the play, this movie tells a lot about Edith's sad and eventful childhood. This part of her life would include interesting tidbits about being in the circus, as well as going blind with her sight restored by what seemed to be a miracle by her patroness Therese of the Child Jesus. These details of course was beyond the scope of the play. The play though spent significant time to tell about Piaf's activities during World War II, as well as about her second and last husband, Theo Sarapo. The latter was mentioned in passing by Piaf on her deathbed. On the other hand, the film totally skipped these two important episodes of Piaf's checkered life.But both in the movie and play, the music of Piaf is front and center. In the film, while Marion Cotillard perfected the stance, facial expression and gestures of Piaf, she only lip-synched to the original recordings or recordings done by a sound-alike. The stage Piaf though had to sing LIVE with bravura with every performance. The final song 'Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien' was a truly a spectacular showstopper in both film and play as sung in French. However the film thankfully had English subtitles to tell me what the song really meant, and I saw how much meaning the song had to Piaf's life as whole at that point.The eventful life of Madame Edith Piaf is truly a winning acting piece for any actress. With the film and the play, I witnessed both actresses transform into Piaf. Lucky for Cotillard that she just needed to do this once right to be printed on film, the actress in the play had the additional challenge and difficulty to do repeated performances of this very physically and vocally draining role. In any case, both this biopic and the play will have you interested to listen more to the music of Piaf. Fortunately for us in the age of Youtube, we can also check out video recordings of the real Piaf in action, and we will marvel more about how these talented actresses portrayed her so convincingly.",6,1,1,13 March 2013
Before Sunrise," A Rare Film of Riveting Conversation
","I have heard about this movie for a very long time, and I know it has a multitude of devoted fans. I do not exactly like watching romance movies so I did not really feel the need to watch this. However, with the coming release of the third installment this month, and all the fervid anticipation for it, I finally relented and watched this cult classic, 'Before Sunrise.'An American guy Jesse meets a French girl Celine on a train from Budapest to Paris, and hit if off, having a great conversation going between them. When Jesse had to get off at Vienna to catch a plane to the States early next morning, he suddenly asks Celine if she would join him in his last night in Europe so they can continue their talking. Celine impulsively agrees, and the two talk about life and love all night long, meeting some odd characters along the way, until the sunrise broke and they had to go their own ways, vowing to meet up again in that same train station after six months.I have to admit it was not too easy for me to get into it at the start. However, maybe the charm of Celine and Jesse, thanks to the very realistic performances of Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke, drew me in and got me listening to their endless stream of conversation. The refreshing spontaneity of Celine as portrayed by Delpy had me beguiled. She is completely believable as a girl Jesse fell completely in love at first sight with.Kudos to the script by Director Richard Linklater for the natural flow and glow of words and ideas that people can relate to, succeeding to rivet the attention of even the most jaded of viewers to a movie that is nothing else but conversation between two people. The final scene of goodbye at the train station was very effective as a cliffhanger of sorts. Now I know why people were so excited when 'Before Sunset' was released in 2004, nine years after the first film.",8,0,0,8 July 2013
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Provokes Thoughts About Love Relationships
","I have not seen a Woody Allen movie for a very long time. In fact I do not even remember the last one. Watching 'Vicky Cristina Barcelona' brought it all back -- the incisive and thought-provoking ideas elucidated in the very smart dialogue. Vintage Woody, back to form. Nobody can write with so much neuroses in its varied forms like Woody Allen.That said, I think the screenplay, while very witty, also had its flaws in its very unexpected plot turns. First, who was the Narrator? He surely helped the story along, but who was he in the first place? However, my main qualm was the way the problem of Vicky got resolved which I found contrived. I did not like it. It seems to be the easy way out.As for the main actor, I'm sure all the men in the audience would agree what a lucky guy Javier Bardem is, sharing the screen bed with three gorgeous women -- Scarlett Johannson, Rebecca Hall and Penelope Cruz. He is just laid back here and clearly enjoying his fantasy role of a woman-magnet artist.Scarlett Johannson is very natural and carefree as the free-spirited Cristina. Her character makes a key yet sudden decision midway in the film that upsets the status quo. This is another one of my problems with the script. She has certainly come a long way from the girl in 'Horse Whisperer.' My favorite Scarlett role remains to be Griet in 'Girl with a Pearl Earring.' Rebecca Hall looks and acts very different from her confident character in 'Frost/Nixon,' playing the mousy and conflicted bride Vicky. As the more conservative and rigid character, she had to convey her emotions in less words and less body language. Yet she gets her character's conflicts across.However, it is Penelope Cruz who is the only member of the cast nominated for an Oscar (for Best Supporting Actress). Her character Maria Elena is far and away the most showy role and she goes to town with it. I did not like the way the character was written, but Ms. Cruz did very well in it, if not a little overdone.I should mention one more actress, Patricia Clarkson. She has a short role, yet instrumental in the development of Vicky's character. Ms. Patricia does very well in her few minutes on screen.I'm not really sure why this was nominated (and won) for Best Musical/Comedy in the Golden Globes. While the cinematography, set design, music and Barcelona are all fantastic, the topics tackled are quite serious and controversial. Especially for Asian sensitivities. Overall though, 'Vicky Cristina Barcelona' is not entirely a Valentine sort of romantic movie. The script provides difficult questions that challenges the audience to think and discuss afterward.",6,1,3,13 February 2009
Saving Mr. Banks," Good Old-Fashioned Tear-Jerker
","This film recounts the story of how the 1964 Disney classic film 'Mary Poppins' came to be. Author P.L. Travers was adamant in keeping her precious character Mary away from Hollywood until rough financial times force her to concede. But, she would not make it easy for the man who wants the movie made, even if he was Walt Disney himself.Emma Thompson plays the bitter curmudgeon P.L. Travers so well, like it was second nature. We see her literally giving Mr. Disney a hard time (like, how can you make a film without the color red?), yet we completely see where she is coming from. She plays someone so unpleasant, yet we will still be charmed. Tom Hanks is too much a superstar with a distinct look to completely disappear into another iconic Hollywood figure Walt Disney. However, if you see beyond the actor, Hanks captured the essence of the man Disney - - his joie de vivre, his passion, his optimism.Colin Farrell plays the flawed father of Travers whose life and death haunted his daughter her whole life. Farrell comes up with a rare, deep and sensitive performance that we have never seen from him before.Fans of 'Mary Poppins' will surely enjoy this look back at the process of how the movie and those wonderful songs were made. This is an good, old-fashioned film that will truly move even the hardest of hearts.",8,3,6,2 January 2014
Beowulf," Technology is the Star Here
","I watched this spectacular movie completely in mind-blowing 3D and IMAX! I think this is the only way to watch this movie, and I do not regret the money I paid for it.This is one of those movies where the technology is the star, not the story, the script nor the actors. The movie is completely computer generated. The artwork was excellent in the architecture, the landscape and the male characters, especially Beowulf himself. The 3D effect multiplies the grandiosity and excitement of everything in the film several-fold. The action sequences were really top notch in 3D, most especially the climactic battle of Beowulf and the Dragon. I certainly cannot imagine how this movie would look and feel in 2D.Ray Winstone's Beowulf looks every inch a hero, but the story makes him flawed, thus more realistic. I did not know who Winstone was before this movie. He has a grand time looking heroic, with his stances, poses and braggadocio. He was totally naked during his battle with Grendel, and the way his manhood was hidden by various other props can be quite amusing, which distracts from the great action somewhat.I was a bit off-put by the strange over-the-top rendering of Grendel's monstrosity. I did not expect such extremely grotesque interpretation, with a mishmash of deformed human features. The script did imbue Grendel with much drama and tragedy, much enhanced courtesy of Crispin Glover's acting.Angelina Jolie was depicted in gorgeous elaborate artwork as Grendel's mother. All the scenes involving Jolie were really very well done. She does well in looking both beautiful and sinister at the same time. Her costume is very remarkable as well. Unfortunately, aside from her, the other female characters were not very well rendered, particularly Robin Wright Penn's Queen.Overall I would really recommend watching 'Beowulf'. But please watch it in 3D. I cannot avoid comparing this movie with a similarly-themed movie shown earlier this year, '300'. I liked '300' much better because of the live actors involved. (I read that 300 was also available in 3D IMAX format, but I am not sure if they showed this locally. I don't think so.) I gave '300' a 5-star rating despite seeing it only in 2D. 'Beowulf' could have been an average movie, but it gets an extra star because I saw it in 3D.",7,1,3,6 December 2007
Fantastic Mr. Fox," I Liked It, But This Isn't For Kids
","'Fantastic Mr. Fox' is the story of the titular Mr. Fox, his family, his stealing shenanigans and his rivalry with the three notorious farmers from whom he stole. This film is an adult version of a children's story by Roald Dahl, as interpreted by American director/writer Wes Anderson. It was interpreted in rather old-fashioned-looking, almost monochromatic (orange-yellow-brown) stop-motion animation. The attention of my sons were not held by the slow beginning and by all the talking. My daughter was not even interested to watch it at all.I, on the other hand, quite enjoyed it. The dialogue is funny and witty, and very adult. There is even a hilarious attempt to hide all profanity with the word 'cuss'. I do not really like stop-animation movies (like 'Gumby' or 'Wallace and Grommit'), but their pain-stakingly detailed efforts are appreciated.George Clooney definitely inhabits the character of Mr. Fox. He appropriately channeled Danny Ocean, especially in light of the heists that Mr. Fox was pulling, complete with smug attitude. Meryl Streep portrays Mrs. Felicity Fox. I felt there was nothing really special about it. Any actress could have done it just as well. Apparently the supporting cast is composed of actors who are staples of Wes Anderson films like Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Jason Schwartzman, etc. I particularly liked how Murray voiced Attorney Badger.I read an excerpt of 'Fantastic Mr. Fox' from the Roald Dahl book that we had. It turns out while the main characters and the stealing capers are similar, the rest of the movie (like the cousin rivalry, among others) is entirely Wes Anderson. I had never seen a Wes Anderson movie before, although I had long heard of his work like 'Rushmore' or 'The Royal Tenenbaums'. But after watching 'Mr. Fox,' I think I will check them out.",6,0,1,30 January 2010
Live Free or Die Hard," Non-Stop Action Extravanganza!
","Finally I got to see this film, and boy was it worth the wait! The action sequences hearken back to the slam-bang first three Die Hard movies. The original 'Die Hard' deservedly was named the best action movie of all time, and this installment successfully carries the tradition of excellence on.While 'The Bourne Ultimatum', was sleek and smart, this one is pure brawn, muscular and explosive, all care of its star, Bruce Willis. I have been a fan of this guy since his Moonlighting days as David Addsion. While he surely looked grizzled in this one, only Bruce Willis can play John McClane. He faithfully stuck to the character we all admire for being cool and collected, tough as nails, yet inexplicably melodramatic when it came to his family (his daughter Lucy, in this case). Of course, it's no Bruce Willis film without the smart-ass humor and attitude, and he puts it on thick in this one! The story is so current and so close to what can actually happen in reality. It dealt with a 'fire sale' cooked up by a disgraced CIA man, Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant). A 'fire sale' is when someone hacks into and causes major snafus in the transport, financial and telecommunications and finally in basic utilities, in so doing, holding the entire USA in his hands.John McClane gets dragged into the action when he was assigned to protect one computer hack Matthew Farrell (Justin Long) who had been targeted for execution by Gabriel. And wow, their adventures and close calls are as slam-bang as they can ever get. Ingenious action scenes include that inside a tunnel culminating in a car blowing up a helicopter (!) and that where a jet and truck battle on the freeways. The martial arts action between McClane and Mai (played by the fantastic Maggie Q) is breathtakingly exciting.I'm not discounting a 5th installment, as Bruce Willis is looking still fit and capable as any of the upcoming young guns. A must-watch for action movie fans!",9,1,3,16 August 2007
Thor: The Dark World," Its Sense of Humor Is The Spark!
","In the beginning, there was a all powerful dark force called The Aether. The powers on Asgaard contain this force and keep it hidden for thousands of years, only to be found by none other than astrophysicist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman). When The Aether takes possession of Jane, of course, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) comes to her rescue. However, as Asgaard and the Nine Realms face the resurgence of the Dark Elves led by the diabolical Malakeith (Christopher Eccleston), a catastrophic planetary alignment threatens to end the existence of the whole world. Thor was forced to solicit his incarcerated renegade brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) to help him with his elaborate rescue plan. Can the two estranged brothers actually work for one common goal?Honestly the first hour of this new Thor film was so dark it was almost dull. The computer-generated special effects looked so fake and unimpressive, very obviously cartoonish mayhem. The acting can be so hokey and corny, so serious and heavy-handed despite the emptiness of the story. The plot itself is very familiar, and reminiscent of many other superhero films. The romantic scenes of Natalie Portman wearing a gown felt like scenes in a 'Star Wars' prequel.But there was that sudden turn around midway in the film when Thor and Loki joined up that the film snapped into place and never looked back up to the very end. The second half came alive because of its quirky sense of humor. These boisterous moments were largely due to the characters of the eccentric Dr. Eric Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård), Jane's cute intern Darcy (Kat Dennings), and Darcy's own dorky intern Ian (Jonathan Howard). I feel these funny moments saved this film from wallowing in self-seriousness. They may seem so out of place, yet they were still so laugh-out-loud hilarious.However, are these funny scenes really what director Alan Taylor wants us to remember this movie for? The brotherly interaction between Thor and Loki should have been the main focus, but this can be buried under so many other less-important computer-generated details that tend to overwhelm this production. In any case, overall, this film turned out very entertaining superhero action film that audiences will enjoy. You may not really be able to fully understand how the fight action went from realm to realm in the climactic battle but these were exhilarating to see. The artwork in stark red and black with broad brush strokes over the final credits were awesome to look at. Don't leave right away as you know there will be extra scenes to whet your appetite for more adventures to come. 7/10.",7,14,29,30 October 2013
Moonrise Kingdom," The Uncomfortable Scenes of Sex and Violence Ruined This For Me
","I only came across the title of this movie when the list of nominees for the Golden Globes came out. 'Moonrise Kingdom' is among the nominees for Best Motion Picture - Comedy or Musical. I decided I would watch it, and maybe, since the initial scenes involved kids, maybe get my kids interested to see it too.Not so. Even if the lead characters were young tween kids, there were several scenes that were very uncomfortable even for someone my age with kids that age. It is not because the film dealt about two kids running away from lonely homes. However, with scenes involving violence with scissors and arrows with an actual victim killed, or worse, French kissing and inappropriate touching while dressed only in underwear, clearly this is NOT for kids at all.The film had the old-time feel of 'The Fantastic Mr. Fox' which I liked, innocent, nostalgic. No wonder, since this film was also directed by Wes Anderson. The setting of rural America in 1965 is recreated so well with the amazingly detailed production design. The scouting scenes were also very charming, mostly that is. The veterans in the supporting cast which included Bruce Willis, Bill Murray, Edward Norton, Frances McDormand and Tilda Swinton all did very well.For me, I was disappointed that Wes Anderson had to go too far with his depiction of teenage aggression and sexual experimentation. While I know these things do happen in real life, this film could have been a more precious piece without those disturbing scenes. They could have been executed with less graphic details. Too bad, I cannot allow my tween kids to see scenes like those yet. The rest of the film would have been perfectly nice to watch with them.",6,0,3,30 December 2012
Midway," Account of Crucial Naval Battle in Emmerich Style
","This film is a straightforward retelling of the events in the first months of the War in the Pacific beginning with Pearl Harbor and culminating in the Battle of Midway (June 1942). In between, it also touched on Doolittle's Raid on Tokyo (April 1942) and the Battle of Coral Sea (May 1942). The story was told mainly from the point of view of two American soldiers, namely pilot Lt. Dick Best (Ed Skrein) who led his dive bomber squadron at Midway, and intelligence officer Lt. Comm. Edwin Layton (Patrick Wilson) who with his code-breaker team predicted the Midway attack.Along the way, we meet other famous American soldiers: Admiral Chester Nimitz (Woody Harrelson) Commander in Chief of the US Pacific Fleet; Vice Admiral William 'Bull' Halsey (Dennis Quaid) who led the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise; Rear Admiral Raymond Spruance (Jake Weber) who took over the Enterprise for the Battle of Midway; Best's fellow aviators Lt. Comm. Wade McClusky (Luke Evans), Lt. Comm. Eugene Lindsey (Darren Criss) and Lt. Comm. Jimmy Doolittle (Aaron Eckhart); cryptographer Commander Joseph Rochefort (Brennan Brown) and Aviation Machinist Mate Bruno Gaido (Nick Jonas).The side of the Japanese Imperial Army and their unique military culture were also given fair screen time in this film. Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto (Etsushi Toyokawa) of the Imperial Japanese Navy and the Commander in Chief of their combined fleet, was portrayed with calm and quiet dignity. We also get to meet other Japanese officers and their own brands of leadership Rear Admiral Tamon Yamaguchi (Tadanobu Asano) who commanded the Hiryu with nobility, and Vice Admiral Chuichi Nagumo (Jun Kunimura) whose controversial battle decisions had negative impact against the Japanese campaign.The execution of the critical battle scenes are the main draws to watch this film. Director Roland Emmerich will always be remembered as the man who brought us 'Independence Day' (1996) and '2012' (2009). Of course, there are big explosions and massive destruction here as well. The massive scenes showing fiery exploding seacraft and aircraft were rendered with crisp cinematography and meticulous visual effects to create impressive screen spectacles. The aviation scenes, particularly the dive bomber runs by Dick Best, were excellently staged, shot and edited to elicit an exhilarating rush.For its 2 hours 18 minute run, the story of the crucial naval battles and the heroism of its real-life protagonists were front and center here in 'Midway.' There were no fictional characters or cheesy love stories like in the first 'Midway' film or 'Pearl Harbor.' While seeing some popular young actors like Criss or Jonas can be distracting, the all-star cast generally rendered honor and respect to the heroes they portrayed. Focusing on soldiers of lesser rank allowed for some intimate personal drama in actual battle situations, perhaps with not much depth as possible. As this movie is rated PG, so do not expect to see graphic injuries at the level of 'Saving Private Ryan.'",8,390,524,29 October 2019
Flight," The Trailer Already Tells Us the Whole Movie Except for the Ending
","The trailer pretty much tells us already what 'Flight' was all about. An ace pilot saves a crashing plane from a worse fate by a daring yet skillful inversion maneuver. However, as public adulation for his miraculous feat builds up, the pilot had to face investigation for the alcohol and drugs found in his post-flight blood exams. Thus, the question is set up: will he get away with it all or will he own up to his personal demons? That is all that the trailer does not tell us.I watched 'Flight' mainly because of Denzel Washington's Oscar-nominated lead performance as the pilot Capt. Whip Whitaker. He deserves this citation because he was able to convincingly navigate the emotions that are eating up this troubled, tormented and broken man. While we admire him for his piloting skill, we also detest him for his uncontrollable addiction to alcohol, the lies he makes up to cover up for it and the personal relationships he ruined along the way. I do not particularly enjoy watching movies about people who destroy themselves, and this is one of them.Alcoholism had been a favorite subject for Oscar winners, both for males and females, including Lionel Barrymore ('A Free Soul'), Ray Milland ('The Lost Weekend'), Robert Duvall ('Tender Mercies'), Nicolas Cage ('Leaving Las Vegas'), Vivien Leigh ('A Streetcar Named Desire') and Susan Hayward ('I Want to Live'). Denzel's performance in 'Flight' would have been a shoo-in to join that illustrious list of winners in any other year, except that this year he was up against stronger nominees.The Oscar nomination for Original Screenplay was a nice bonus for this production. I thought the subplot about another drug addict Nicole (sympathetically played by Kelly Reilly) was not really too important in the main story arc, and just prolonged the running time beyond two hours. It was also good to see Robert Zemeckis back in a live action film (after 'Beowulf' and 'Polar Express'), but his directorial style seems to be stuck in the 1990s because 'Flight' did have a sort-of 'dated' TV-movie feel to it.",6,2,5,16 February 2013
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," One Spectacular Highlight After the Other
","Despite being burned before about watching HP6 in 3D IMAX, I made it a point to see this one, for all its sentimental value, in that format. I must say that the 3D IMAX was worth every cent. The big images and the added dimension also added to our immense satisfaction about this film, added expense notwithstanding.There action here was relentless as it goes from one highlight scene to another. From the exciting incursion of the trio into Gringott's Bank to get into the Lestrange Vault and their exhilarating escape, the unexpectedly (for non-readers) revelatory Pensieve memory of Prof. Snape, the very intense and destructive Battle at Hogwarts, the explosively watery destruction of the Hufflepuff's cup, the fiery aftermath of finding Ravenclaw's diadem, all the way up to the final showdown between Harry and Voldemort. These scenes were all very memorably shot, with incredible visual and sound effects. The way the ultimate destruction of the Dark Lord was rendered (of course, you knew that good will triumph over evil) is a 3D moment to remember!This movie is, for all intents and purposes, a perfect film to end the franchise. It was indeed the grand finale, if you will. I'm not anymore going to go into how the children all grew up in front of our eyes. Having gone through eight films with these people, we also share in their despair and eventual triumph. We all probably had a teary smile during that charming little epilogue showing a scene at the train station 19 years later. Okay I am going to say it now: This is the best movie of the year for me. Congratulations to David Yates and the excellent cast for perfectly recreating J.K. Rowling's incredibly intricate final book (some small details changed notwithstanding). This film is indeed a bittersweet victory for the creators and for the fans alike.",10,9,17,14 July 2011
The Purge," A Very Unlikely Law, I Hope
","In the year 2022, the US government under its 'New Founding Fathers' enact a law enabling an annual event called 'The Purge'. On that specific 12-hour period in the month of March, from 7 pm to 7 am the following day, vigilantes can legally go around town killing 'undesirables' of society.This film follows the Sandin family, an affluent family living in a huge mansion, on one particular Purge Night. Father James (Ethan Hawke) has a successful security systems company, while Mother Mary (Lena Headey) lives the life of a typical rich suburban housewife. Their teenage kids Zoey and Charlie are typically detached from their parents. The problem starts when young Charlie lets a Bloody Stranger (Edwin Hodge) asking for help into their house. A group of masked college-age vigilantes led by their Polite Leader (Rhys Wakefield) goes up to the Sandin house and demands them to hand over Bloody Stranger or else hell will break loose. It does.The unusual premise of the film will grip you with its seeming inhumanity. Set in the near future, you will get to thinking why a law like this would ever be enacted. Is this a wise law that will actually benefit society? Will the crime rate really decrease with this grisly yearly ritual? Those moments when you see the Bloody Stranger on the Sandin CCTV monitor, your pulse rate will begin to race. The build up of suspense was excellent right up to the moment when Polite Leader and his group show up at the doorstep. After that, the movie just devolves into another typical film depicting the violent violation of a private home.Characters will be doing what we will think are the most stupid possible option given those situations. Such is the norm in most horror films, isn't it? This film is not immune to those clichés. Since murder is legal in that world, murders will happen. This film will not shirk from violence, probably to send a message how senseless violence can be. That is it the educated set that seems to promote this culture of violence on Purge Day is an eye-opener in this age where the power of access to social media is already dictating societal norms presently.I had hoped that there would have been a more detailed depiction of the aftermath of that Purge Day. Those faceless voices, snippets from radio broadcasts, we hear over the closing credits, were haunting and disturbing. But that will be all we get. We want to know more about this new world order. Unfortunately the film makers do not give us more insight to the wider implications of their original idea. 5/10.",5,2,4,26 July 2013
Pitch Perfect," Fun, But the Song Numbers Can Be Hit or Miss
","I only got wind about this film after I saw a couple of teenagers singing a song a capella while rhythmically flipping tumblers during a birthday party. They said it was from 'Pitch Perfect' so I sought out a copy to see what this film was all about.This film's theme is very much like 'Glee.' Some misfit girls try to make their mark in college by joining a disgraced a capella singing group called the Bellas. The story follows the girls as they try to be the first all-girl group to win Nationals. However, with all the drama queens in their small group (ala 'Mean Girls'), it is not going to be easy an easy task.This film is very popular with the teenage set. However, for me, the humor is already very much at the boundary of raunchy comedy at times. Definitely, it crossed the gross-out comedy boundary of PG with all the inexplicably voluminous projectile vomiting scenes. There were some weird comedy like the mousy Asian girl Lilly whose voice was so soft you'd wonder how she got into a singing group at all. (She is cute though, but she says the darnedest things, if you actually hear what she says.)The personality of Beca, as played by Oscar nominee Anna Kendrick, was so unlikable. She sticks out like a sore thumb playing it so seriously while the others were obviously having fun with their characters, especially Rebel Wilson (as Fat Amy). I can't really say I was rooting for her at all.The singing scenes, which were supposed to be the highlight of the film, were hit and miss. Some were very good, like 'No Diggity' and the other songs sung during the sing-off in the gym. However, there were those where the mix was not too good. The final song number by the Bellas in particular, while generally good, was marred by a terribly pitchy solo by no less than Beca herself.Anyway, despite all my problems with the execution of this film, in general it was entertaining to watch. I can completely see why the teen set loves this film with all the hip song mash-ups and the funny scenes and lines, but I do hope they are mature enough to recognize that is only 'comedy,' so far from what really matters or happens when they are in college.",6,1,2,9 April 2013
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," First Was Already Very Good, This One Was Even Better!
","The first movie in the Hunger Games series was very well made. It was generally faithful to the Suzanne Collins book on which it was based. The actors chosen for the cast were all very good in portraying the characters, vividly bringing the book to life. I was really looking forward to this sequel which tackles the second book in the series.This movie had a change in directors. From Gary Ross who did very well in the first film, this sequel is now directed by Francis Lawrence, whom I do not know. But there was certainly nothing to worry about after all. This second installment managed to up the ante, coming up with a film that excellently captured the escalating political turmoil among the Districts in Panem and how Katniss becomes its fiery symbol.The story picks up from the first film, where Katniss and Peeta return to their homes in decrepit District 12. Katniss's unprecedented act of near-suicide during the last Hunger Games had been seen by several citizens as an act of defiance against the government. Alarmed by this development, the threatened President Snow hatches a plan to kill Katniss before she causes more unrest all over his domain.In celebration of the 75th year of the Hunger Games, previous Victors (one male and one female) from each District to fight in another games to the death called the Quarter Quell. Being the only female Victor of District 12, Katniss was an automatic contestant, and the odds were stacked against her favor. To her surprise, she has new allies and they seem to be supporting her. How will the results of this special edition of the Hunger Games affect the revolution already catching fire outside the Capitol walls? Jennifer Lawrence is perfectly cast as Katniss Everdeen. She is really one awesome actress, burning the big screen with her emotion, making it impossible to resist empathizing with her. Even in that simple scene during the Victors Tour in District 11, home of the fallen Rue, her short heartfelt speech can make you teary-eyed. Her character can be maddening with her seeming indecision between her two consorts, but Jennifer rises above that cheap love triangle cliché. Her graceful action prowess was on full display in that archery exhibition in the training room.The other members of the cast from the last film steps up their performances for this film. Josh Hutcherson improves on his rather cheesy performance in the first film with a stronger performance here as Peeta Mellark, Katniss' games partner. Liam Hemsworth has more screen time as Gale Hawthorne, Katniss' close friend who loves her.Woody Harrelson was perfect as their mentor and former Victor Haymitch Abernathy. Elizabeth Banks succeeded to shine through her outlandish costumes and makeup as tributes escort Effie Trinket. Stanley Tucci was over-the-top in a good way, as over-the-top emcee Caesar. Lenny Kravitz has a brief but powerful role as Katniss' stylist Cinna.The new members of the cast also inhabited their roles like well-fit shoes. Donald Sutherland was formidable as President Snow needed to be. Phillip Seymour Hoffman had the requisite sneakiness and sinisterness as new Head Gamemaker Plutarch Heavensbee.Sam Claflin is not exactly the charismatic District 4 victor Finnick Odair I had in mind when I was reading the books, but he did alright. Jena Malone was better as sassy and rebellious District 7 victor Johanna Mason.The special effects of this film were amazingly conceived and executed. The Victors Chariot Parade was grandiose in its scale. The Games Venue itself and its various booby traps was so harsh with the poison fog, the vicious baboons, the confounding jabberjays, among others.The costumes of Katniss also make amazing statements in the book. I was really looking forward to how these special gowns were to be shown on screen, and I must say, they were worth the expectations. The other technical aspects such as cinematography, editing, production design and sound were all top-notch as well.This film tackles a serious political topics very well, simplified for its young target audience, but not in a way that insults more mature viewers. The Hunger Games is in a class of its own when in comes to excellence among all these young adult series that came or are coming out now -- a clear notch above all the rest.",9,10,37,21 November 2013
Godzilla," Slow Burn to Explosion
","I know about Godzilla, but I am not by any means a die-hard fan of this Japanese nuclear monster. I did not even get to watch the much-maligned 1998 Hollywood Godzilla film with Matthew Broderick. But definitely the pulse-pounding and very intriguing trailer made really want to catch this present-day homage to the classic film monster.From vintage-style scenes showing nuclear experiments in the 1950s, the story jumps to 1999 in the Philippines, where a big earthquake unearths evidence of a giant fossilized monster. Following this, another massive but unnatural tremor occurs in Japan causing the destruction of a nuclear facility where Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) loses his wife and destroying the once good life he lived.The story jumps 15 years to the future when Joe's son Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) returns home after years his military service. An emergency call brings him back to Tokyo to help his dad who seemed to have never moved on since the tragedy of 1999. Unusual seismic activity similar to 1999 are happening again, but this time it unleashes three destructive monsters, two huge flying mantis-like creatures, and one gigantic dinosaur-like beast, whom they called Godzilla. They wreak havoc not only in Japan, but across the globe, reaching a climactic battle-royale in San Francisco.Bryan Cranston is really a very sensitive actor. I know him because of his award-winning performances on the TV show 'Breaking Bad', though I have not really watched that show beyond the first episode. He is the true human heart of this film. Aaron Taylor-Johnson has really evolved from the nerdy pseudo-hero Kick- Ass to how he looks in this film. I did not recognize him. Oddly, he feels generic here, little star presence, giving a serviceable but ultimately forgettable lead performance. Ken Watanabe is really the go-to Japanese lead actor. In this film he plays the Japanese scientist who was studying these monsters. Mr. Watanabe was very good in conveying distress with his intense face. However, I felt he sounded very garbled when he talked. I think I lost a lot of details because of his unclear pronunciation of words.Technically, the sound was so massive. It reverberated through the whole theater causing us to shake. The computer-generated visual effects were similarly top-notch, especially the monsters and the destruction they were causing. We watched this in 3D which for me while nice to see, did not really add much to the enjoyment of the film. The film had a rather dark and muddy color palette, I believe the 3D made it even more murky-looking.I felt the build up to the last hour when Godzilla was finally being revealed was very slow. It was only Bryan Cranston's presence that kept these scenes from being boring. The story-telling felt turgid, and repetitive. However, whenever the titular character Godzilla was on screen, up to his very last scene, it was truly awesome indeed. The final battle in San Francisco was epic and emotional, the best parts of the film as a whole, particularly that moment when he first unleashes his nuclear laser-like breath. Director Gareth Edwards, in his desire to remain faithful to the story's Japanese roots, took a very slow burn approach indeed. But hang on, and the film culminates in one glorious explosion of action and heart toward the end.",7,2,6,15 May 2014
Looper," Reminded Me of 'The Terminator'
","'Looper' is a futuristic movie set in 2074. A crime organization sends people they want to dispose of thirty years into the past, where a hired killer called a 'looper' shoots them from behind. Joe (Joseph Gordon- Levitt) is one such looper. One day, he was sent his future self (Bruce Willis) to kill. Old Joe escapes being shot by Young Joe, and from there Old Joe plots to kill the future mob boss (called 'The Rainmaker') while he was still a little boy named Cid. This was to prevent a future event where the Rainmaker kills Joe's wife. However, Young Joe gets finds Cid first and gets close with his mom Sara (Emily Blunt). How will Young Joe and Old Joe resolve this conflict of interest?Honestly, did we not already see the concept of killing a person before he matures back in the 80s with 'The Terminator'? Cid's mother was also even named Sara -- shades of Sarah Connor in 'Terminator' isn't it? This future Rainmaker wasn't helpless though, as he had remarkable powers of his own. Are they asking us to also believe that super power mutations will be the order of the day in the future? It is very easy to like this movie if you just glide over all of the time travel improbabilities. The whole concept is so violent and sort of illogical, yet JGL and Bruce Willis make it all look so cool. I have never seen Emily Blunt look so tough before. These three lead actors and the child actor who played Cid (Pierce Gagnon) make the film work really well, despite the inherent limitations of this sort of story.",6,0,9,9 January 2013
300," Breathtaking Nobility!
","This movie is so awesome! We have seen so many cloak dagger epic battle movies before. But in the age of computer-generated effects, we have had 'Gladiator' and 'Troy', to name but the most high-profile ones. 'Frank Miller's 300' somehow even surpasses these very accomplished films.The whole look, cinematography, costume, sets, editing, musical score, make-up, and yes, sound and visual effects all score superlatives! It is beautiful to see, despite the relentless gore and splattering blood. It may be true that we are becoming jaded in watching displays of extreme violence on screen. However, the highly stylized choreography of the violent scenes, so over the top that it hews close to its graphic novel origins, is an eloquent cinematic achievement. The acting of the ensemble was commendable. This is the first I have seen of Gerald Butler since 'Phantom of the Opera', and he really lives and breathes Leonides. The actors playing the individual Spartan soldiers are also impressive. Their bodies showed their discipline in preparing for their roles, so much that their muscles look like visual effects. The Queen was also portrayed as a strong character, not a mere helpless woman just waiting for her husband.Highly recommended! I loved 'Sin City', and I have got to say that I love '300' even more. Can't wait for the next Frank Miller project!",10,2,10,8 March 2007
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Spectacular Spy Flick
","When Eggsy was a toddler, his father was killed in the line of work. He was given a special medal by a well-dressed gentleman, telling him that he can call when he is in trouble. Seventeen years later, growing up in a rough London suburb, Eggsy got himself thrown in jail after engaging police in a backwards car chase. He calls the number behind the medal, and in comes the dapper Harry Hart to the rescue. Knowing Eggsy's wasted talents in gymnastics and academics, Harry brings him to try out for a vacancy in his ultra-secret spy organization, the Kingsmen.The fun begins with the opening credits, when letters would form out of the rubble that fell from various explosions of an ancient temple, to the tune of Dire Straits' hit 'Money for Nothing'. You knew by then that you should be ready for something tongue-in-cheek. The beginning sequences do not hide the fact that this would be a graphically violent film. Throughout the film we will be regaled with fights with guns, bombs, and blades, all in extraordinarily spectacular fashion we have never seen before.Colin Firth, an actor who is practically typecast as the shy or dour guy in romantic comedies, shows a totally screen persona here. As Harry Hart, aka Galahad, he is a swashbuckling super spy like we have never seen him before. Mark Strong makes another memorable screen appearance as Merlin, the Number 2 man among the Kingsmen. The ever reliable Michael Caine plays Arthur, the head Kingsman. You know he can play this role with his eyes closed. Samuel L. Jackson is hilarious as the villain Richmond Valentine, an insane megalomaniac telecom tycoon with a lisp planning to have mankind kill each other. Exotic beauty Sofia Boutella is Valentine's vicious henchman Gazelle, a graceful killer with her deadly sharp prosthetic legs. Mark Hamill was unrecognizable as the elderly environmentalist Professor Arnold, whose abduction starts the action.The biggest surprise is the breakthrough star-making performance of Taron Egerton as Eggsy. In the beginning it took some time getting used to the new face. But as the film went on, Egerton will possess the screen with his action skills and suave charm, even in the presence of his esteemed co-stars. By the time the film ends, you could not wait to see more of this young man in future films. Overall, this is a very entertaining, visually stimulating film. The production design, with all those gadgetry and weaponry, is very inventive and eye-catching. The musical score is pulsating and exciting. The action sequences were really relentlessly bloody, with various body parts getting impaled, sliced off or blowing up. Yet, this was all done with typically British wry humor and aristocratic class. Director Matthew Vaughn takes the James Bond genre, and mixes in the superhero and hi-tech elements of two excellent films he directed before ('Kick-Ass' and 'X-Men: First Class'), as well as some Cockney elements from his earlier productions like 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels'. With 'Kingsman', he has actually managed to create something even more fantastic. This is the best 2015 release so far. 9/10.",9,3,11,19 February 2015
The Hangover Part III," The Extra Scene in the End Credits Saved This Film
","The first Hangover film was a irreverently funny film that unexpectedly made a lot of money in 2009. Strike while the iron is hot, so a Part II came two years later, with practically the same story set in another city. Despite that bad sequel, there is now this Part III another two years later. I still say it should have ended with the first movie.The Wolfpack, namely Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms) and Doug (Justin Bartha), decides to help Alan deal with his mental problems by bringing him to an institution. However, on the way there, their car was attacked by a gang led by Marshall (John Goodman). Marshall told them that since Chow had been in communication with Alan, he wants the Wolfpack to get back the gold bars Chow had stolen from him before.The movie went by so fast that when the ending comes, you will wonder where the time went. The plot here was so thin. Part III was more about Alan (Zach Galifiniakis) and Chow (Ken Jeong), two side characters in the first two films who end up with the biggest roles in this final installment. The Wolfpack were just supporting here. Bradley Cooper hardly did anything substantial to deserve his top billing. I do not know what the producers were thinking to make that disgusting Mr. Chow practically a lead in this film. He was okay as a minor comic relief in the first film, but his role here is just too much. Seeing Chow suffocating a chicken is simply too annoying for words.The humor is pretty dark. An animal loses its head in a cartoonish fashion in the very first sequence. Then, someone's dad died. There was NO wedding with a disastrous honeymoon hangover to recover from at the beginning, so at least they tried to change things. Unfortunately, this new formula was hit or miss, with very few hits. The guest appearance of Melissa McCarthy as Cassie from the Vegas pawn shop is quite cute though, despite her brief screen time. It was good to see Heather Graham there again, as well as the baby in the first movie now a big boy.Ironically the biggest laughs were reserved for an extra scene in the middle of the ending credits, and no, it was not only a funny photo album this time. So stay seated for that one in order to make up for the feeling that you got ripped off watching the rest of this shallow film.",4,0,0,29 May 2013
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," Practically 'New Moon' All Over Again
","Before going into the movie house tonight, I was so ready not to like this movie. 'Eclipse' is positively the worst book in the Twilight franchise. It even discouraged me from reading the next book 'Breaking Dawn.' The entire book was an just an over-extended exposition on the indecisive wishi-washiness of one Bella Swan over the vampire Edward and the werewolf Jacob. This very same conflict was already introduced and tackled in 'New Moon.' For me, it did not really reach a new level here in 'Eclipse.' Unfortunately, it is the same way here in the movie version.The best scene in the book only happens past Chapter 20 already when Bella and her two consorts were caught in a single tent in the mountains during a big storm. Same way here in the movie. It features a most hilariously memorable line when one tells the other 'I'm hotter than you!' After that though, even the book was better than how Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner monotonously delivered their subsequent cheesy lines.Director David Slade continues the same character quirks established in the first two movies, like how Bella and Edward love to talk in a field of wildflowers, how Bella's dad Charlie (Billy Burke) provides the comic relief, and others. We got to see the origins of Rosalie and Jasper. We also get to see the history of the Quileuete tribe. The main background conflict was how Victoria was establishing an army of new blood vampires in Seattle in order to kill Bella and avenge her lover's death. These fight scenes were actually quite well shot with good special effects. It was also good to see Anna Kendrick (fresh from her Oscar nomination for 'Up in the Air') as Jessica delivering the valedictory speech at their graduation rites. So overall, we did not really see anything new in the love triangle aspect. Things did get more physically intimate for the three main characters, more than the previous one, but the 'romantic' lines do get more corny. This is a movie that Twihards will love, but I do not think it can stand by itself. I feel this is actually a step down from 'New Moon.' The main limitation is really the book this movie was based on.",5,16,45,29 June 2010
Minions," Cute Alone Is Not Enough
","Since the first 'Despicable Me' film (2010) and more in its 2013 sequel, those cute little yellow sidekicks constantly stole the thunder from under the lead character Gru. This was reminiscent of how the cute side characters like Puss N' Boots or the Penguins stole scenes in 'Shrek' and 'Madagascar' respectively, and got their own solo movies. It certainly was not a surprise that these Minions got their own solo project also.This film was a prequel that spanned from the beginning of time on earth. Minions existed even before the first land creatures crawled out of the water. Since then, they would follow the most evil creature around like the T-Rex, probably for commensal reasons. Eventually they moved on to serving evil men, Dracula and Napoleon among them.Because of their klutzy nature, they could not stay too long under one master. They all just retreated into their own snow-covered community, becoming very bored. So one day, a tall long-faced Minion named Kevin thought of venturing out to look for a master for them. For his quest, he had with him Stuart, a guitar-playing, single-eyed Minion and Bob, an adorably short Minion with mismatched-colored eyes and a teddy bear.The trio trek all over the world, finding their way to Orlando, Florida in the year 1968 for Villain Con. There they meet the super-villainess Scarlet Overkill (voiced by Sandra Bullock), who just so happened to be looking for new henchmen. With hi-tech hippie age weaponry provided by her husband Herb (voiced by Jon Hamm), Scarlet sends the three Minions to steal Queen Elizabeth's crown for her. Will the Minions be able to pull off their big heist?Despite some dips in the momentum, most of the film was action-packed and crazy fun. I especially liked the cultural references given the time period in the late 1968, as I am sure most adults will be. The Sydney Opera House under construction, the shows being shown on the black-and- white TV, the Abbey Road reference (although the crossing happened in 1969) -- I enjoyed these little tidbits of nostalgia the film provides. I also liked the musical soundtrack and how it complements the period when this film was set.The story went in all directions in a rather scatterbrain way. It is also ironic and actually disturbing how a kiddie movie seemingly targeted for very young audiences had very dark and negative humor, like a bank robbery with kid accomplices or torturing Minions in a dungeon. That they made it look 'cute' is not enough to erase the bad taste in the mouth. There were also some risqué humor in the mix. Really, having a Minion wear a thong?!I did not really like the character of Scarlet Overkill too much with her over-hysterical personality. (Sandra Bullock's voice work was only at her best during her 'Bedtime Story' scene.) Her husband Herb was a lot cooler, making him the more interesting villain. All this prequel was riding on was the popularity of the cute yellow Minions. For me, they were hilarious as the sidekick of Gru in the 'Despicable Me' films. Unfortunately, for the Minions to carry one whole film with cuteness alone does not cut it. Hearing their gibberish language for an entire hour and a half can be tiresome. In fact, I felt I was relieved to finally see the boy Gru at the end. (That is not really a spoiler, isn't it? You knew he would be in there somehow.) Gru and the Minions are a great comedy team TOGETHER, not apart. The little kids around me were quiet most of the film, only laughing briefly during the slapstick scenes. When I discussed this film with my own kids after we watched it, they also expressed that they found the film underwhelming and disappointing as a whole. So I conclude that it was not only because of my age that I found it so. 6/10.",6,7,13,11 July 2015
Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted," This one is really strictly for the kids.
","The first 'Madagascar' was unexpectedly funny and entertaining. Those four lead characters Alex, Marty, Gloria and Melman were delightful and pretty likable. However, the second one already gave me the feeling that the franchise was getting tired. Now that the Penguins already have their own TV show, I don't really want to see them on screen anymore! However, how could I say no to the kids who wanted to see this third installment? I just had to grin and shell out for the tickets.Missing their zoo in New York after a long stay in Africa (from the second film), our four friends now make their way to Europe in order to find a way to go back to their old home. While being pursued by the French Animal Control officers, led by the superhuman-ly relentless Captain Chantel Dubois (who wants Alex the Lion's head on her wall), the four join a circus animal train to escape. How opportune that this particular train was en route to New York too. So now, Alex and friends have to help their new friends get their circus act together in order to be finally NYC-bound.I felt that this whole flimsy story was just there to in order set up the stage for one spectacular scene: a very colorful and beautifully- animated 'Fantasia'-inspired sequence of multi-animal circus acrobatics accompanied by Katy Perry's hit song 'Firework.' The relationship of the four friends, which was the center of the first two episodes, were hardly tackled at all. This time it was just all about the action of eluding the animal catchers and getting to New York. The voice work was flawless as usual. Having Frances McDormand there as the vicious Capt. Dubois and Jessica Chastain as the cute jaguar-trapeze artist Gia were nice to know as the final credits were running.Overall, I did not enjoy this one too much. I did not really have any LOL-moments while watching this particular installment. There were in fact a lot of cringe-worthy moments led by that very lame sequence where Marty was painted white with big polka dots and wearing a huge multi- colored Afro wig. As for the new characters, the ability of Vitaly the Tiger to go through small hoops was too impossible, the face of Stefano the Seal is too annoying to be cute, and the bear 'girlfriend' of King Julien the Lemur felt unnecessary. This one is really strictly for the kids.",6,6,12,10 June 2012
The Cabin in the Woods," I'm Buying Whedon's Wild Theory
","'A Cabin in the Woods' had received so much critical praise as an excellent horror film, so this horror movie fan could not resist a bait like that. I did not read anything about the plot nor have I seen the trailer before going into the theater this morning. What can I say, this must be one of the most convoluted horror stories ever put in screen!It starts with a couple of old guys in an unspecified company talking about their mundane lives. Then, the focus cuts to some college kids who were about to go on a road trip. It is only later when you see the connection between these two disparate sets of characters. We would then see a situation seen in countless horror flicks where the characters are trapped in a lonely cabin in the God-forsaken woods where they are killed off one by one by zombie rednecks. But is that all there really is to it?The five college kids are stereotypical of what we see in practically every horror movie we had ever seen before: the whore, the athlete, the scholar, the fool and the virgin. Cliché you say, but this literally multi-layered script by wunderkind writer Josh Whedon (who just gave us the masterpiece called 'The Avengers') would actually attempt to explain why these five characters should be present in all horror movies all over the world. I know that sentence probably made no sense, but that is the main premise of this over-reaching screenplay. You would never imagine what the bigger story would be, and who actually gets to deliver the explanatory lines towards the end. Acting is not a focus here, and it may actually be intentionally bad as a send-up to most horror flicks. Chris Hemsworth does not really act or look like Thor here, and could actually be played by any jock actor and would not make a difference. The computer-generated effects were excellent especially in the grand mayhem scenes where practically all the horror creatures of movie lore make a gory appearance. This ambitious conceit would be the main bone of contention of those who like and dislike this complicated film: do you buy Whedon's wild theory or not? I certainly liked it and I'm buying it.",8,3,15,2 May 2012
Happy Feet," Animated Film Tackles Serious Issues
","Went with my 7 yr old daughter to watch this film last night. Animation quality was cute and adorable, especially the baby penguins. It was actually the appearance of the lead character Mumble as an young adult that was left unexplained, since he never matured in appearance even towards the end. I personally loved the song and dance numbers, which was what this film is expected to deliver and does not fail.For smaller kids, there are very scary scenes with the violent leopard seal, who looks like a swimming T-Rex! The Orca scenes are also scary for kids, but better executed.The point of view of the animals from inside the oceanarium was very touching. Those scenes regarding the fishing industry and pollution of the oceans was admittedly heavy, adult and unexpected in a film like this one. But truth be told, it was quite eye-opening and could serve to be the springboard for discussion with older kids. I did not really get the connection between the penguins' dancing and the decision of the United Nations at the end, but then it goes back to the fact that this IS as children's film to begin with.",6,1,5,20 November 2006
Her," In Love With Technology and Scarlett's Voice
","'Her' has a near-futuristic concept that may already be happening now. Theodore works for an online firm writing made-to-order letters for people. He is undergoing a divorce from his wife, and is very lonely. He has acquired a new operating system for his computer, named Samantha, with whose voice he feels an intense bond. Theo falls in love with Samantha.Joaquin Phoenix gives us another one of his quirky performances of Theo, a sensitive man we would probably label as creepy in real life. He makes this unlikely situation likely with his touching portrayal of loneliness. Amy Adams plays his nerdy friend Amy with whom Theo shares his thoughts. She is also our relief from the moodiness of this film. Roonie Mara plays his estranged wife Catherine, who can't believe that her husband has already that deeply withdrawn from human relationships.For me though, the performance of the film was not even visible, but only heard. Scarlett Johanssen gives us the performance of her career as the thoroughly delightful and sensual voice of Samantha. All those cute inflections and infectious laughter brings Samantha to life. That scene when Sam talks to Theo's five-year old daughter was such a precious moment. A film like this will only work if we believe that a man can actually fall in love with Samantha. The way Scarlett breathes life into Samantha, we do. Director Spike Jonze I only knew one other time with another bizarre film called 'Being John Malkovich' which I really enjoyed. This one is more meditative and contemplative than that other film, but he succeeds to create an atmosphere of romance in what may seem to be a soulless concept on paper. As writer, Jonze used words which were very poetic, even bordering on mushy. There are many quotable romantic lines here which lovers will be borrowing in days to come. It may seem all absurd, but if you think about it, it really is not, the way we are already all bound to our gadgets in one way or the other. As it is now, actual personal human interaction is already being compromised by our dependence on technology. This film will make you reflect and reassess your own attachments to technology and people around you who love you.",8,1,13,11 January 2014
Slumdog Millionaire," Shades of 'City of God', But Still Very Good
","Jamal Malik is poor young man from the slums of Mumbai joins the TV game show 'Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?' From that simple yet ingenious plot and setting, this most memorable film unfolds, detailing the events in this boy's miserable life which (very) coincidentally enables him to answer the trivia questions in the quiz show.I like that the movie delved on the relationship of two brothers, Jamal and his elder brother Salim. While Salim goes the gangster/hit-man route, Jamal strove to make a more decent life for himself as a call center gofer. While there is violence in their relationship, brotherly love still comes through in repeated occasions.In addition, there is also a love story here. A slum girl named Latika had her life intertwined with the brothers during an ethnic massacre when they were kids. Jamal and Latika naturally become fond of other, but are separated two traumatic times, but can they find each other again at the end? The story was told as flashbacks from their childhood, teenage years and their young adulthood. The child actors were most affecting in their portrayal, especially the boys. The child Jamal had that wide-eyed innocence, while the child Salim had that worldly-wise jadedness. Very effective! I do not know why the adult Jamal (Dev Patel) was acting in such a flat manner in several parts, but he is most effective in his scenes with Latika (Frieda Pinto).Honestly, I really felt that 'Slumdog' had a big similarity with the Brazilian classic 'City of God' when it came to the brutal and unforgiving depiction of the squalor and violence in the slums. The unmitigated violence in the treatment of the poor slum kids is most disturbing. The big difference of course is that 'Slumdog' is more neatly tied up and positive in its final message when compared to 'City'.This movie already won the Best Picture Drama in the Golden Globes. Yesterday, it won the Best Picture in the Producers Guild of America. And just this morning, it won Best Cast in the Screen Actors Guild Awards. It certainly bodes very well that this movie is the film to beat come Oscar time for Best Picture.The treatment of Director Danny Boyle (of 'Trainspotting') is very exciting and dramatic. Though story elements can be quite contrived (like that final 20M rupee question could not have been that easy, could it?), it will still hold you at the edge of your seats until the last scene.",9,1,5,26 January 2009
Mad Max: Fury Road," Beautifully Badass
","I have only a fleeting memory of the Mad Max films from 1979-1985 directed by George Miller and starring Mel Gibson. These were set in the dystopian future in Australia, where energy is a critical commodity. Max was a man mad with revenge after his wife and child were brutally murdered. This setting is all the background you need to know about the previous franchise in order to enjoy this present incarnation, 30 years after 'Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome', the last film of the first trilogy.In the massive Citadel, a skull mask-wearing tyrant Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) rules, cruelly withholding precious water from his impoverished subjects. Mad Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) has been captured to become a blood donor for Nux (Nicholas Hoult), one of Joe's War Boys. Elsewhere, Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), a female War-Rig driver, helps Joe's five wives escape to the fabled 'Green Place' of her childhood. Nux, with Max still attached to him, joins Joe and the other War Boys to pursue Furiosa. This chase leads to a major explosive battle-royale in the desert, one that would cause an upheaval of the balance of power in the outback. The screenplay by George Miller, Brendan McCarthy and Nico Lathouris was rich and complex, with deep emotional moments. The cinematography of John Seale, with his orange-tinged day scenes and yellowish-hued night scenes, was breathtaking to behold. The magnificent action sequences with 90% actual (not CG!) vehicular stunts with gigantic monster trucks were so perfectly planned and executed. These were edited with precision by Margaret Sixel, with awesome sound mixing to boot. I thought the eye- popping 3D effects for those exhilarating car chase scenes are very much worth the extra in ticket price.Tom Hardy was impressive in both his athletic ability and his facial expressiveness as the quietly macho Max. He was required to underplay his role since Max is a strong and silent type. But to his credit, Hardy was able to come up with a relatively silent but memorably strong performance. His final scene was very haunting even without any words being spoken.Despite being totally bald, one-armed, with black grease on her face, Charlize Theron never loses her elegant screen presence for a moment. Her performance, so rough and physical and yet so warm and moving, was the very heart of the film. Truth to tell, she was riveting every time she is on screen, even stealing the thunder from the title character himself. Rare as it may be for an action film, I feel Theron is definitely in serious contention for a Best Actress award.More than anything else, 'Mad Max: Fury Road' is one gorgeous-looking film. Director George Miller was able to mine cinematic beauty from the vicious violence and badass brutality amidst the dirty and dusty dystopian setting, and that is no mean feat. I am looking forward to the coming installments of this new and improved Mad Max franchise. 9/10.",9,5,15,16 May 2015
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," An Overlong Metallic Mess of a Movie
","I did not exactly enjoy this movie. I went in with no big expectations, simply more of the same as the first two films. I could not really believe how much more of a mess this was, compared to the previous two. The story was actually very simple. A senior Autobot named Sentinel Prime resorts to traitorous means in order to achieve his dream of reviving their dead planet Cybertron. Can the Autobots here on Earth avert the mayhem which result from Sentinel's evil scheme? I'm pretty sure you know the answer to that question.I call this movie a mess because it really looks and sounds very messy. Like before, you can barely identify which transformer is which, be it Autobot or Decepticon because of extremely close and fast action shots. Everything looks like a noisy blur of metal across the screen. I'm thankful I did not watch it in 3D or it would have just tripled the eyesore. The ONLY character (robot or otherwise) who meant anything above all this mess is Optimus Prime. He breathes life to this movie every time he is on screen. The human characters are really not needed in this story at all. I do not know why people feel it is cool to act this annoyingly over the top and loudmouthed. Everyone resorts to this acting style - from Shia LeBeouf to John Turturro to Frances McDormand to Patrick Dempsey. Megan Fox's replacement, the beautiful Ms. Rosie Huntington- Whiteley was an oasis amidst the chaos but that is it. The funny lines uttered by Sam's mother remain to be my favorite lines in the whole film.I felt there were simply a lot of useless and indulgent scenes. This caused the film to bloat up to a tedious two and half hour running time. While the Apollo 11 moon scenes were an interesting beginning, the rest of the movie simply collapses after the title card.",4,14,30,3 July 2011
The Social Network," 'Like'
","I saw this much-buzzed film in an advanced screening yesterday, and I must say it lives up to its hype. I was really doubtful how anyone could charge up a story about such sedate topics as computer and business, and create a generally engaging movie. However, watching 'The Social Network' dispels those doubts.This movie shows us how the Facebook came to life. It seems that hell hath no fury like a computer geek scorned. From that one night when Mark Zuckerberg was rejected by Erica Albright, events were set into motion that led to the creation of an internet phenomenon. The subsequent events involving friendship, inspiration, back-stabbing, and double-cross that drives this story forward. It is said that the story was derived from court documents. Zuckerberg himself denies the story happened exactly that way. We will never really know how much of this is false testimony or dramatic license.The lead actor Jesse Eisenberg perfectly plays the flawed protagonist Mark, who was so self-absorbed that you'd hate him, yet still admire him for his talent and drive. Justin Timberlake plays Napster founder Sean Parker, who was instrumental to push Facebook into the big time. This character was written to be so annoying, and Justin succeeds to annoy. On the other side, Andrew Garfield sympathetically plays Edward Saverin, Mark's only friend and financier in Harvard, and alleged 'victim' of Facebook's rise into the financial stratosphere. Comic relief was provided by the 'Winklevii' twins, who turned out was just portrayed by only one actor, Armie Hammer. Good camera trickery there. Also, you will be surprised by what the foxy Brenda Song (ex-Disney's Wendy Wu) will do here.However, as a movie, 'The Social Network' works. The script of Aaron Sorkin (best known for writing 'The West Wing') is very rich and witty. The direction of acclaimed director David Fincher was sure and precise, following the tradition of his previous films like 'Se7en' and 'Zodiac.' Yes, this is a movie with a lot of talk, but the pace, cinematography, and editing were all on point. It was not boring at all, as the atmosphere is kept interesting and tense despite the techno-babble and legalese. If this movie were a Facebook page, I would click 'LIKE'.",9,2,5,19 October 2010
The Great Gatsby," Leonardo Di Caprio IS Jay Gatsby
","Two days before I watched this 2013 version of 'The Great Gatsby,' I read the classic F. Scott Fitzgerald novel and watched the 1974 film for the first time. The book was about a man named Jay Gatsby who moves heaven and earth, building his immense wealth from practically nothing, to be with Daisy, the woman he adored who married wealthy Tom Buchanan because 'rich girls cannot marry poor boys.'This 2013 version was directed by Baz Luhrmann. You will really notice his touch in those lavish and opulent parties that Gatsby held in his West Egg mansion. Luhrmann pushed the envelope again in the musical soundtrack department, as he did in 'Moulin Rouge'. Imagine making use of unarguably anachronistic hiphop and even rap on top of the scenes from the Roarin' 20s! This is polarizing stuff, you either like it or you don't. I thought it was brave and original, but I did not really like it for the film as a whole.Like the 1974 film, the story-telling was also very faithful to its literary source, even lifting words verbatim in the narration and the dialogues. However, Luhrmann imagined psychological therapy situation as bookend devices, for Nick Carraway to tell and then write all he knows about Gatsby the man, his next-door neighbor for whom he becomes a close friend and confidante. The lavish set design and costumes, already done very well and award-winning in the 1974 version, were further improved and enhanced by modern visual effects. These will definitely be contenders again come Oscar season next year.The actors really outdid themselves in this edgier, more passionate 2013 version, when compared to the rather safe and straight-forward 1974 version. That three-way confrontation scene that took place during that hot summer afternoon in the Plaza Hotel alone deserves award consideration for ensemble and individual performance from the three central characters. Joel Edgerton had a more seriously haughty and brutish attitude than Bruce Dern as Tom Buchanan. Carey Mulligan had the stunning beauty and grace that would make it believable that Gatsby would obsess over someone like her. Mia Farrow simply did not have those qualities before, and was so easy to hate. And of course, there is Jay Gatsby himself. Robert Redford played a very perfect Gatsby: handsome, cool, unruffled, confident. However, the Gatsby in the book is not perfect: insecure, nervous, obsessive- compulsive and maybe even delusional. Leonardo di Caprio, I believe, nails this book Gatsby perfectly. Di Caprio is believable as a Gatsby who may have had unsavory means of reaching his present status. You can see the vulnerable chinks in his armor. Redford looked and acted like he was born rich. My one complaint though is that I think the writers gave di Caprio too much of the expression 'old sport' to say, but that is the writers' fault not his.If there was one factor that made this film a 9/10 for me rather than 10/10, it was the cheesy portrayal of Nick Carraway by Tobey Maguire. I thought Maguire did not look right for the part, and his Nick was too weak, at least when compared to the smart portrayal of Sam Waterston in 1974. Maybe the therapy sessions Luhrmann wrote for his character did not really do Maguire any favors in this regard. When I was reading the book, I did not really get the sense that Nick would become an alcoholic.In any case, that casting mishap is only a small glitch in the whole picture. This film was very well made and deserves to be seen by all who love the book, or even fans of the 1974 film. It is a vast improvement over the 1974 version. The use of flashbacks in this current version to show us more about the history of Gatsby as a boy and young man was really helpful to understand where he was coming from. The symbolism of the green light and the eyes of Dr. Eckleburg cannot be ignored this time. Too bad I was not able to see the 3D version so I could not comment on that. I can just imagine though how Gatsby's wild parties would have looked wilder or those cool vintage cars racing down the road would have looked snazzier in 3D. Highly recommended!",9,1,7,21 May 2013
The Proposal," Sandra Bullock is Really so Funny!
","The main premise is quite far-fetched. Margaret Tate is a cold and bitchy Canadian book editor working in New York. She was not able to take care of some Immigration papers, so she is under threat of deportation. She coerces her assistant Andrew Paxton to marry her, in order to circumvent this problem. So the two of them fly off to rural Sitka, Alaska to meet Andrew's family. There, Margaret rediscovers the warmth of family life and love.This is a really funny movie. I was actually shamelessly laughing out loud at several parts. Hahaha! Most of the success of this film lay on the star power of its female lead, Sandra Bullock. She is beautiful and classy, yet she is not afraid to play these funny scenes that threaten her dignity. She is really one funny actress. She is still one of my favorite actresses.The funniest scene was when Margaret needed a towel after her shower but the dog kept on barking at her. There was a scene where she was just covering her essential parts with her arms and a bath mitten! Hahaha! The scene of Margaret fitting the Granny's 1929 wedding dress with her small breasts lost in the fabric is also very funny. There were scenes that that teeter on being flat, like the eagle flying off with her phone, or the scene with Granny (played by scene-stealing Betty White) dancing Eskimo rites in the forest, but it was Sandra Bullock's sheer comic timing that turn them into gems.It was great to see Betty White again after all these years. I read in an interview that she is already 87 years old in real life. She is still quite sprightly and she looks very good for her age. Her naive Rose Nylund in 'The Golden Girls' remain to be one of my favorite TV characters of all time. Too bad she was not given more substantial screen time and dialog here.I leave the judgment about Ryan Reynolds to the ladies. I felt there was something missing in his chemistry with Sandra Bullock in their scenes together. His character is not as well-written as the Sandra Bullock character.The most irritating character in the whole movie (even more than Andrew's dad and the INS official) is the multi-tasking Latino neighbor, Ramone (Oscar Nunez). All his scenes (especially the stripper scene) could have been deleted and the movie would have survived. Even his scenes during the closing credits were excruciatingly unfunny.Overall, we both liked this movie. It was light and hilarious. A good movie for a good date. You can feel that this cast under director Anne Fletcher (Step Up, 27 Dresses) was having fun while they were shooting this. And picturesque Sitka, Alaska seems to be a great idea for a vacation one day.",7,1,5,31 July 2009
Valkyrie," Competent Story Telling, but Problem with the Star
","In a film like this, there is really nothing to spoil because everyone knows how it would end. I watched the video of 'Valkyrie' in several installments, but the flow of the story was no problem. The story being told was very interesting -- the plot to kill Adolf Hitler by German patriots led by Claus von Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise) and its aftermath. The direction by Bryan Singer was very exciting and suspenseful, holding my interest successfully.There were so many competent character actors there, not everyone was convincingly German though. My main problem with the whole movie is the lead actor himself, Tom Cruise. He is too much of a star to make his portrayal of von Stauffenberg convincing. Even with the eye-patch, he is still Tom Cruise. He did not disappear into the role, as would have been ideal for a movie like this.",5,1,1,18 June 2009
The Simpsons Movie," A Homer of Another Sort
","Maybe I went into this movie with very high expectations, so it was just alright for me. Not the laugh-out-loud-fest that I thought. I admit I haven't been watching the TV series lately already, so maybe that's part of the reason.The line at the beginning of the movie says it all so frankly: Why watch a movie that you can watch on TV for free??? It even goes further to call everyone watching a sucker! I think those were the best lines in the whole movie! Hahaha! The humor was not very spontaneous, especially in a lot of parts that dealt with the main plot of how Homer single-handedly wreaked environmental havoc on Springfield and its dire consequences on his family. The Alaska part of the movie was not very productive. I took away a lot of screen time that could've been given to Mr. Burns and Smithers, Maggie's sisters, Apu and the other interesting characters in Springfield itself.The storyline of Bart was quite dramatic and even touching (ironic, huh? hehe). Marge, Lisa and Maggie act as I knew them, and I liked that. Lisa's really a great quirky little character. However, for me, Homer's character was not very likable in this film, compared to how he was in the TV show. On TV, the tight situations Homer gets into were due to his stupidity and boorishness, which we find cute and charming. But in this movie, he seemed to be uncharacteristically ill-tempered and ill-intentioned. I think this was a major issue in my not liking the movie as much I wanted to. Even the main bone of contention in the plot, the Pig, was just as easily and casually dismissed and forgotten in the end, as it was haphazardly introduced in the beginning.",6,1,4,5 August 2007
The Fighter," Outstanding Supporting Actors Buoy This Boxing Drama Up
","In the midst of my work and Christmas shopping, I felt the need to catch this multi-nominated film. I am so glad I did because it is outstanding. OK, the typical ingredients of a boxing flick are here. A down-and-out underdog protagonist, the training scenes, the boxing ring scenes, the redemption towards the end. But the remarkable thing about this particular film is the fantastic acting, which can already be seen in the awards nominations already announced.The ironic thing here is that the supporting actors have more acting challenges than the main character. It is good that Mark Wahlberg (as Micky Ward) was finally nominated for his acting, but his co-stars really stole the thunder from under him. He was basically underplaying his quiet character. Unfortunately, I also felt Wahlberg was miscast, being too old to be playing a young boxer on the rise. He was very realistic during the actual boxing scenes, as though he was a real boxer. (Wahlberg's training sessions with his idol Manny Pacquiao was very evident!)Christian Bale had the showiest role as Micky's self-destructive half- brother and trainer Dicky Eklund. He was as far from his Bruce Wayne persona as can be. He was gaunt, slovenly and garrulous. Melissa Leo, wow, shines in another very showy role! She is amazingly realistic as the domineering mother of these two boxers. Her Alice was a most self- possessed, quarrelsome and hateful character as they come. Amy Adams also plays against her usual type as sassy Charlene, Micky's girlfriend who gives him back his confidence and a way out of his losing predicament. Even the more minor supporting characters were well- played: Jack Mc Gee as George Ward, Mickey O Keefe as himself, and even the seven annoying women who played the big-haired white-trashy sisters of Micky.This film is fast-paced and interesting to watch. Director David O. Russell does a very good job in helming this project. I am glad it is getting the awards consideration it is currently earning. Very sure that the three supporting actors will make it all the way to the Oscar nomination listing.",8,3,4,18 December 2010
Law Abiding Citizen," A Revenge Rampage Which Can Get Unbelievable
","Only once in a rare while do we encounter a movie with two main characters who are both protagonist and antagonist at the same time. 'Law Abiding Citizen' is one of these movies where the line between right and wrong is blurred into an almost invisible line by the circumstances that surround it.The movie goes directly to the point. Clyde (Gerald Butler) loses his family right before his very eyes. Public prosecutor Nick (Jaimie Foxx) cuts a deal with the perpetrators to get a compromised win. Clyde did not appreciate this, and takes the law into his own hands. He planned not only to kill the criminals, but also to reform the entire justice system with an elaborate plot which he describes to be 'of Biblical proportions.' This ambiguity of everything that is going on is the best thing about 'Law Abiding Citizen.' I just felt that too little was established about Clyde to convince us that he is really capable enough or even monstrous enough to pull off this Machiavellian scheme of his. If you can just look beyond this gaping plot hole (and the pretty high violence and gore quotient), this film does have its engrossing points. It keeps you guessing to the very moment of climactic revelation.People who love action and a good mystery will enjoy this film. It is a good film to pump up adrenaline with, and to match wits with the writer. The extreme violence and gore (which at one point gets uncomfortably gratuitous) may appeal to some people, but turn others completely off. You can however shield your eyes at just the right moments and enjoy the rest of the film.",7,0,2,12 March 2010
Up in the Air," Do Not Expect Too Much Out of This
","I watched this movie because it was cited in all of the major award giving lists as a contender for Best Picture. All its stars, George Clooney, Vera Farmiga and Anna Kendrick, have been nominated for acting awards. Therefore I watched with high expectations. And once again, the hype left me disappointed.The story is simple enough. And somehow, I think I just saw a variation of this same story recently in 'The Messenger.' It involves a man Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) with the unpleasant job of firing people from their jobs in different cities around the US. A new upstart colleague Natalie (Anna Kendrick) has come up with the idea of firing people through the internet, instead of in person. So Ryan brings her along with him on his job to let her experience the human drama involved firsthand. Along for the ride is Alex (Vera Farmiga) who is essentially Ryan's kindred spirit in a commitment-less affair. Events unfold that cause Ryan to question the very lifestyle which he had been used to for so many years.OK, it was fine, mildly entertaining, with some pithy dialogs. But for me, it was just alright. Nothing that special as a whole. George Clooney is good, but I felt he was better in 'Michael Clayton' than here. His movie star aura really gets in the way of his role as a lonely person, making it difficult to gain the audience's empathy. Anna and Vera are proficient, but nothing spectacular in their acting.So, you may want to catch this if you like wordy movies about loneliness, rejection, and emptiness. But do not bring too much high expectations when you do decide to watch, because frankly, I did not really see what the big Best Picture fuss was all about.",5,14,29,5 January 2010
Atonement," The Classic Epic of 2007!
","This is the fourth of the Oscar Best Picture nominees I watched. Compared to the other three, this movie is the one where I come out feeling that Oscar is written all over it. This is the one with the elegant epic feel, reminiscent of past Oscar winner 'The English Patient'.This is where cinematography (by Seamus Mc Garvey) is a key star element. All the scenes were meticulously composed shot like a special painting on a moving canvas. So many breathtaking and sweeping landscapes. Even the scenes depicting the horrors of war were imbued with artistic insight. So many vivid portraits as well with penetrating pain and anguish.This is where the musical score (by Dario Marianelli) harks back to bygone grandiosity, like many past Oscar winners. Yet the tension in the music is uniquely heightened by the sound of typewriters typing. This ties in neatly with the story as the central character is a writer.The story begins with Briony Tallis (an Oscar nominated Saoirse Ronan), a fanciful 13 year old girl who loves to write. She had just read a lustfully-worded love letter by the son of their household help Robbie (James McAvoy) to her sister Cee (Keira Knightley) and actually caught them in a compromising situation in the library. That night, as an assault is perpetrated on a guest in their opulent household. Briony accuses Robbie as the culprit and thus he is brought to jail. This part of the movie felt like 'Gosford Park.' The second part of the movie traces how the love story of Cee and Robbie progressed through the war years four years after the arrest. Robbie was released from jail when he decided to join the army. Cee becomes a nurse. However, Robbie gets sent to France and they continue to communicate their love through letters. This part of the movie felt like 'Cold Mountain' and 'A Very Long Engagement.' I felt the third and last part of this story is the one that gives it its defining characteristic and twist. The story goes back to Briony, now 18 (Romola Garai). She is now fully cognizant of her erroneous accusation and its tragic effects. She gives up her slot at Cambridge and becomes a nurse as well. She seeks out Robbie and her sister in order to atone for her past sins. And just when you thought it is all over, Briony comes back again, this time in the present (Vanessa Redgrave) in an epilogue with more to tell us.I am not surprised that this film had already won the Golden Globe and the British Academy Awards for Best Picture. I feel that its chance for the Oscar for Best Picture may be compromised by the fact that its Director Joe Wright was not nominated. I am not surprised why its lead stars McAvoy and Knightley were not nominated. While they maybe the bigger stars, in the story, they play support to the main story of the Briony character. While this film had its flaws, particularly its derivative feel in a greater part of the story as I have already indicated. But so far in its totality, among all the nominees I have watched, this is my favored one for Best Picture of 2008.",9,3,4,17 February 2008
Furious 7," Over Activated Adrenaline!
","'Furious 7' follows the same adrenaline rush formula that fueled the first six film in the franchise to box-office success. The barely-there story just functions to string together some of the most memorable and impossibly spectacular stunts involving the most muscular cars ever captured on film. As the stunts get more and more complex and incredible, there is a dramatic real-life twist that would challenge the filmmakers further for this seventh installment, and that is the death of star Paul Walker in, as fate would have it, a race car accident. How they deal with Walker's death in the film will be a matter of curiosity among fans of this franchise. The plot here follows right from FF6. Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham), a Black-Ops savvy brother of a former fallen enemy, is out for revenge big time. Striking a deal with a secret government agent code-named Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell), Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his posse rescues Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel), a hacker who had been kidnapped by Jakande (Djimon Hounsou), a terrorist with military-grade firepower. Ramsey had developed God's Eye, a powerful tracking system which can use all available digital devices around to locate any subject.On the action front, this film is on adrenaline overload as the gang goes from Los Angeles and Tokyo, to Azerbaijan and Abu Dhabi.. The cars here don't only look great, they also do the most amazing things. I'm sure it was really very hard to top the already over-the-top stunts we saw in FF6, but the insane stunts we see here in FF7 could definitely match them. Cars jumping out of planes ( a major stunt dubbed 'air drop'), cars hurtling down cliffs, cars jumping from skyscraper to skyscraper -- they have got it all here! With Jason Statham there in the mix as the main antagonist, there would not be a dearth of heart-stopping, bone-crunching mano-a-mano fights. Right off the bat, Statham would engage Dwayne Johnson in a hard-hitting brawl that destroys an entire office. Of course, there will also be a climactic Aston Martin-smashing face-off with Vin Diesel himself at the end. Paul Walker had his own breathtaking fight inside a moving van against Thai martial arts star Tony Jaa. Michele Rodriguez had her dynamic fight scene in full evening gown regalia vs. MMA star Ronda Rousey in an elegant penthouse suite.The FF series is as much about family as it about action, and this is not forgotten here. Toretto is dealing with the amnesia suffered by his wife Letty. Walker's character Brian is trying to quietly settle down as a family man with Dom's sister, Mia (Jordana Brewster).The much- anticipated final send-off and goodbye to Paul Walker was touching yet very manly. Director James Wan takes a break from his horror films and successfully orchestrates these visually spectacular out-of-this world vehicular stunts with his crew. They were also able to give Paul Walker a fitting and dignified farewell. The scenes where Paul's real life brothers Caleb and Cody stand-in for him were not obvious as the editing was very well done. Of course, they made Toretto and company virtually superheroes the way they can emerge from all those incredibly dangerous situations unscathed. It does seem absurd, but isn't this really how fans consider them? The 'humor' of Tyrese Gibson's character Roman can be groan- inducing, especially in that party scene, but I'd say it's tolerable.Overall, I would say that this particular installment of the FF series definitely achieved what it set out to do. This is a very entertaining film indeed. The Lykan HyperSport and Nathalie Emmanuel look fantastic. When put side by side with the other FF films I've seen though, I think Fast 5 and FF 6 were still better than this. 7/10.",7,1,14,10 April 2015
