Requiem for a Dream," Another virtuoso performance from Aronofsky
","Surely this is one of the best films of the year. It is a fierce, hypnotic take on Hubert Selby's Jr's novel. Just as he did in his directorial debut, Pi, Aronofsky has used his distinct, fascinating visual style as a form of narrative voice, conveying intense emotion with fabulous repetition and dizzying, effective camera work. Much will be made of the editing style, but in the director's capable hands, the technique isn't pretentious or excessive-it is merely unforgettable. A gripping story of dreams deferred, of good intentions frought with dependency. Ellen Burstyn's performance is mesmerizing, coupled with the other actors' intense turns. Cheers to Marlon Wayans in a serious role.",Null,0,0,12 October 2000
