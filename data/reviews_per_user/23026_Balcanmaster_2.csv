Child 44," History repeats itself twice...
","Oh yes, there is a saying that history repeats itself twice, the first time as tragedy, the second time - as a comedy. I am far from thinking that this film is a comedy (on the contrary), but I'm curious how after the phenomenal success of 'Citizen X' there were so courageous filmmakers who dare to do something like remake of it?Obviously, the wave of anti-Russian hysteria is fruitful opportunity for any sort of performances from literary and filmmakers, but in this particular case - unsuccessfully realized. Maybe Ridley Scott must find the courage to engage with directing instead of acting only as a producer? Perhaps the Russians had to let this film widely in Russian cinemas to show the audience a failed attempt to paraphrase the story of Chikatilo, inspired by ideological premises?Actually it does not matter, just the efforts of a great cast are wasted due to propaganda exertions and ad hoc political-ideological campaign. There is nothing more annoying than stupid propaganda. I can not say that this is a very poorly made film by itself, however, certainly looks that way after 'Citizen X'. I would recommend to the audience instead of wasting time with 'Child 44', just to look back and view again cinema masterpiece 'Citizen X'.",5,5,13,28 May 2015
Interstellar," Very difficult to watch
","Sometimes the best directors make terribly weak movies. That is the case here. Incredibly chaotic, inharmonious, confused scenario has become a duty, boring and inharmonious film.Neither the best actors nor high budget can save this film. Pretentious, artificial and false thoughtful, at times boring, banal and full of clich√©s from other movies - in general very difficult to watch.A casual audience, however, would liked similar mishmash, but for true connoisseurs of cinema this film is simply unbearable. I endured it with a huge annoyance and regret for the lost time and vain expectations.",1,4,12,16 April 2015
