Blade Runner 2049," A very great disappointment
","In Spanish we use to say 'second parts were never good' and this film fully acomplishes the bad prediction. I liked the ambience and the soundtrack but the plot was a nonsense, especially if you compare with the original. A great disappointment unfortunately!",4,5,10,3 March 2018
