The Avengers," Adrenalin rush
","In a nutshell, the Avengers are six superheroes brought together by an organisation called SHIELD to protect the Earth. The Avengers (a product of the Marvel comic book publishing company) are Black Widow, The Hulk, Captain America, Thor, Hawkeye and Iron Man. Four of these have already had movies made about them (as part of the same franchise) and this movie draws heavily on that. Out of the four earlier movies involving these superheroes, I enjoyed Thor and The Hulk. I was not particularly bowled over by the Iron Man and Captain America movies. I have to admit a bias: as a childhood DC fan, I was never able to get into Marvel comics. Also, I'm not into video games at all.As you might expect, this movie was a parade of spectacular effects, superhero stunts, fearsome aliens, wild technology, city obliterating fights, shootouts, chases and so on. When I say spectacular special effects, I am not kidding. It's astonishing what filmmakers are able to show on screen nowadays.There was also a good deal of superhero clichés (of the good kind), jingoism (both noble and sappy), comedy, snappy one-liners, oiled biceps and tight leotards. Speaking of the latter two, Chris Hemsworth makes a great Thor.Chris Evans...well, let's just say I don't quite get Captain America as much as I get Chris Evans. I prefer him as the wise-cracking Torch. Mark Ruffalo was OK as Bruce Banner, but the script didn't really give him a chance to do his stuff. This movie was mostly about Iron Man, but I'm not into this superhero. I really don't get Iron Man. Such a waste of a good actor.In general, this movie seemed a little forced to me. There were parts of it that I was unable or unwilling to follow closely. The film had a very fast pace, perhaps too much action. It was clearly designed to be primarily an adrenalin-inducing visual experience. The problem is that I don't go to movies to get an adrenalin rush. I go to be entertained, an emotional and intellectual process, not a physical one.I also have to confess that this movie seems quite similar to other action films I've seen lately. It's getting hard to tell them apart. Scary aliens, awesome technology, skyscraper carnage, endangered Earth. This genre seems to have the same four themes popping up over and over again. I suppose I've become jaded, but maybe it's time for something different? Now that we can show virtually anything on film, it's time to move to other things, don't you think? I yearn for the near-religious awe and excitement I felt when I saw Close Encounter of the Third Kind for the first time many years ago. Avengers is the kind of movie that doesn't deliver that to me. This movie evoked no emotion in me at all really. I didn't feel anything for the characters in this film. I didn't really care what happened to any of them. I felt mostly annoyance at the NYC destruction scenes. The highlight of the film for me involved the amusing final scene with Hulk and Loki, but that's all I'm going to say.It's an entertaining film. No different than the others really. You might as well see it. Everyone else has. The score assigned to this movie on IMDb is far too high and casts a shadow over the entire IMDb ratings concept.",7,1,4,26 July 2012
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," I wasn't really into it
","This new Hunger Games movie is different in that it doesn't actually revolve around the Hunger Games anymore (because after all Katniss destroyed the arena). But don't worry -- Katniss is still at the centre of things. We follow her as she is thrust into the limelight as the poster woman for the revolution. The revolution takes a nasty turn.I haven't read the books. I am barely able to hang on. I know enough about this universe to vaguely follow what's happening but I have a hard time caring about it. It feels contrived. This is not my cup of tea. I was restless and felt the need to groan audibly on occasion. A co-worker found this to be a slow movie in comparison to the earlier ones; I didn't find the movie slow; I found itpointless. I have a hard time caring about any of them. So, why did I go? I am apparently invested in this franchise. I felt I had to see this third movie simply because I had seen the earlier two. How pathetic is that? The strange thing is that I was actually moved at times by this movie. I have no idea why. They were shamelessly tugging at the heartstrings here, and it worked on me. I'm going to bump it up a point for that reason. This is one reason why I go to the cinema.",7,16,34,3 December 2014
Men in Black 3," Entertaining summer movie
","This is a perfect summer movie, wouldn't you say? It's got aliens (lots of aliens), time travel, futuristic technology, great special effects and 3D, a fast pace, a wisecracking Will Smith, cool chase scenes and wild shoot-outs.For those of us older than 14, it's a well written, well acted film with a few good characters. Michael Stuhlberg plays an interesting character who can see 'fifth dimensionally'. The villain played by Jemaine Clement (Boris the Animal) is hilarious and frightening at the same time.The movie lacks some of the more annoying, childish aspects of MIB II. MIB has always been a buddy-movie franchise, but in this version this aspect comes to the foreground. This movie is actually about a relationship, in spite of it all. Josh Brolin is quite good. The movie is very much focused on Will Smith. This movie is perfect for him.Much of the movie is staged in NYC in 1969 so some of the background and humour relate to that. The alert viewer is rewarded with allusions and references of all kinds, including to MIB I and MIB II. The movie is richly planted with these Easter eggs. (I think the director more or less assumes you've seen the first two movies.)",8,2,6,9 June 2012
The Monuments Men," Slow, cliché, unfocused, chauvinist
","Good points: Informative new angle about the war. Thought provoking.Poignant and moving, at times. The breathtaking depictions of all this great art. Wow.Cate Blanchett's excellent performance. Matt Damon's smiling presence (despite being miscast). The scene where Stahl is caught at his farm.Bad points: Unfocused. Too many characters; too many scenes. Not much more than a series of vignettes, some of them cliché and trying a little too hard for audience appeal. Overreaching. Lacking in nuance and subtlety. Approaching mawkishness at times.I must have checked my watch five times during the film.I thought almost everyone in the film was miscast (with the exception of Cate Blanchett). Cliché. We've seen Omaha Beach many times. We have all long ago come to understand the evil of fascism and the Nazis. How many times have you seen a film showing inappropriate recruits attempt basic training? At least this time, they didn't show Bill Murray doing it.It was as if the director was trying to tell the entire story of the Second World War (after D-Day). At times I thought the director was attempting an homage to the Second World War movie genre.Too much stereotyping and chauvinism. To buy into this film, you have to believe (really believe) that art that fell into Nazi and Soviet hands was lost to humanity forever. I think it's fair to point out that the Germans and Russians are generally quite cultured, despite what this movie would seem to have you believe. Was this movie a little too overtly anti-German? Is civilisation in the hands of the Americans? I see this film as an overly simplified and possibly unfaithful representation of historical events. But then most historical movies are like that. The theft of great art by a conquering power has always been part of European history. (Thankfully this movie hints at this.) The movie posits a balance between saving great art and saving human lives, but in truth, it was never one or the other. George, you've played in, and made, some great movies, but something went wrong with this one. It didn't work for me, however I do feel we need films like this to remind us: never again.",6,0,1,22 February 2014
Captain Phillips," Gripping, realistic drama on the high seas
","I was reluctant to go to this film. But 'Captain Phillips' turned out not to have the plot I thought it would, and it also turned out to be a lot better than I thought it would be. I've enjoyed director Paul Greengrass's movies in the past, but this smart, modern movie is his best so far.I suppose it added to my enjoyment that I really had no idea how it would end. The key moment that launched the second half of the movie shocked me. I felt a lot of anger towards Phillips at that moment for being so stupid.I don't think Greengrass could have portrayed the Somali pirates more accurately. He brings these people to life for the film-goer. I wouldn't say that he portrays them sympathetically, but he definitely humanizes them. Nothing is black and white.The second half of the movie is almost a propaganda film for the US military, but it worked for me completely. I'm a little tired of films that make the American military look like boobs or monsters. Some say the second half dragged on too long, but many of us have lost our sense of dramatic pacing and tension because of video games, the internet, and a diet of city-crunching superhero and robot movies. The pacing and tension in the scenes in the lifeboat were necessary for the climax.Tom Hanks is good in this film as a competent captain and ordinary guy, but his performance as a shocked victim at the end was quite moving. All the Somali actors also deserve recognition.A highly recommend film.",9,1,3,24 November 2013
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," We accept the love we feel we deserve
","High school was a difficult time for many people, I think. This movie taps into that by telling the story of Charlie, and his attempt to fit in during his first year of high school in Pittsburgh in 1991. The movie is narrated, the story being told through Charlie's 'Dear Friend' letters.He eventually finds a group of seniors, and falls in love with one of them, Sam (played by Emma Watson). The movie tells the coming-of-age story of his first real group of friends, parties, romances and sexual encounters.The movie does not have much of a plot. Its strengths are character development and showing us what first year at this high school was like for Charlie, especially the experience of finally fitting in, the fun things that his new group does and his budding interest in literature and writing. His family and other aspects of his life are shown to a lesser extent. Not all of the clichés of American high-school movies are dodged, but still I felt drawn in to this world.We find out that pretty well everyone in Charlie's new group is struggling with problems of their own.Charlie (played by Logan Lerman) is a highly likable, sociable, respectful, intelligent, articulate and attractive teenager coming from a loving and prosperous family (so for some viewers it may be hard to see what his problem is exactly). However, as the movie progresses we find out that he is dealing with a few serious issues, so this is not just a story of ordinary teenage angst.This movie (thoughtful, despite its subject) made me think of my own high school experiences. It had a few profound and moving moments.Worth seeing.",8,2,4,29 November 2012
10 Cloverfield Lane," Is Howard their saviour or kidnapper?
","After Michelle gets into a car crash, she wakes up in an underground bunker with two men. The girl assumes she and Emmett have been abducted by redneck Howard, but then learns that she has actually been saved from an apocalyptic event of some kind because the air is now poisonous. However, there is a good deal of doubt about this, so much of the tension in the movie is based on Michelle's uncertainty about whether Howard is lying. Is he a good guy or is he a 'horror opa' as we say in Dutch. SPOILER! Shocking events take place that confirm both sides of the story are true: something terrible is happening up top and Howard is a homicidal kidnapper of young girls. Yes, this is tangentially at least an apocalyptic movie about alien invasion; however, it is also a gripping story about forcible confinement.At first this movie bothered me because of Michelle's emotional state and utter stupidity. She has the accident while texting in the car. The start of this movie will appeal more to those who think women are emotional wrecks, dangerous drivers and helpless ninnies. However, as the movie progresses this problem dispelled for me. We see Michelle's strength emerge. She becomes a strong figure who does what she needs to do to try to survive.The movie seemed to be implausible at first and based on an absurd writing prompt. It does have an artificial, crazy story line. Some of it reminded me of 'The Divide', to be honest, especially her escape at the end.However, it worked well. I enjoyed it. All three actors played their roles well.From what I can see, this movie has nothing to do with 'Cloverfield', although there is apparently a cinematographic connection of some kind.",8,3,8,13 March 2016
The Sound of Music," Movie magic
","What can I possibly add to the many who have written about The Sound of Music, one of the most beloved musical films of all time? When I was 9 years old, my mother dragged me (kicking and screaming) to see this movie. It was for my birthday, but it was actually a movie she wanted to see and I knew it. Well, the movie unexpectedly enchanted me.And over the decades, I have seen it repeatedly, like everyone else I suppose. Even today, I don't pass when it is shown on television. But it goes beyond that. I know all the words to each song by heart. I visited the Von Trapp lodge in Stowe, Vermont, when I went skiing there. When I was in Salzburg not too long ago, I took a tour of the Sound of Music sights. (I've never done that for any other movie.) I've even been carrying a crush on one character for decades.How on earth can you explain all that? It's a movie with intense personal meaning to me, even though I saw it a lifetime ago. And I suspect it has had that effect on many people. This movie is a cultural force. This movie is an antidote to all the cynicism, negativity and complexity of the world. Having seen the film again for the umpteenth time, I can report that it still enchants and delights, from beginning to end. It's difficult to explain the appeal. Is it the nuns, the music, the mountains, the European charm? Is it art, creative genius, movie magic? Sure, Julie Andrews is the shining, perfect heart of this movie, but I imagine there were many people behind the development of the music, the musical and the movie. I hasten to add that for me the attraction is not the music or the musical per se. It's the movie.It's hard to decide which number is best: 'Do-Re-Mi', 'Edelweiss', 'Sixteen Going on Seventeen', 'My Favorite Things' or 'Climb Every Mountain'. When the cyberchildren of the internet and video game age watch this movie for this first time, are they as enchanted as the two generations before them? I hope so.I wonder whether Hollywood is still able to produce musicals with this kind of effect on people.When I give this movie a perfect score, it's my inner child doing the voting.",10,0,6,29 December 2012
Skyfall," Solid Bond movie
","I saw this as a fairly enjoyable movie with a good deal of spectacular action, particularly at the start in Turkey. It's a solid Bond film, worth about 7.5. I liked the fact that the movie changed direction several times. Hang on for the ride.No, it's not a perfect movie. It's a little too long. This film is rather overloaded with shootouts, martial arts fights and chase scenes.Although I suppose the ending worked, and was well played by Dench and Craig, I found the last quarter of the movie to be contrived. Was it really necessary for Siliva to go to London? To bring M to Skyfall? After a while you have to wonder whether saving M is worth all those lives.There were a few aspects of the Silva character that I didn't quite get. Where did he get all these resources? That knowledge of computers? And what was Silva's hold over his henchmen? How was he able to hold his own against Bond? The Komodo scene with groan-worthy. That's a return to the camp Bond of Roger Moore's day.After more than 110,000 votes on IMDb, this movie garners the high rating of 8.1. It also does well on other movie sites. This is turning out to be one of the most popular Bond movies of all time -- like it or not.And yet most reviews that give this movie a high score are getting an unusually high number of thumbs down. I'm not sure what this indicates, but there seems to be a small number of disgruntled movie reviewers who are gnashing their teeth at the popularity of this movie and trying to show their displeasure in any way they can. I'm sure they are not even reading the reviews they are thumbing down. Many of them have reviewed only one film on IMDb.This movie still has the basic elements of a Bond movie. Besides, part of the pleasure of this franchise is to see what the directors and actors have done with the concept.And what they've done with it is to bring it firmly within the current mainstream fad for shootouts, martial arts fights and chase scenes. Many movies are like this now. In this world of blurred genres, it's difficult to tell a superhero movie from a superspy movie. All our movie heroes seem to be invulnerable now. Is this the inevitable by-product of the video-game age? It's hard to see where this will end. Maybe they should make everyone human again.At the very least we all should be deeply grateful that Pierce Brosnan is no longer playing Bond. I certainly hope this disgruntled minority is not pining away for the return of Brosnan.Anyway, those are a few of the good points and quibbles. It's a big movie (a long movie) and worth going to see. You know you'll have to: it's a Bond movie.",8,2,9,18 November 2012
The Hangover," Lame, but funny at times
","II is the funniest; I comes second (despite being the original); III is not funny at all.Having seen this movie twice now, I can report that it is generally a lame and unbelievable film, but one that succeeds in generating a stream of chuckles and the occasional guffaw.The humour is generated almost completely by Alan (Zach Galifianakis) and to a lesser extent by Mr Chow (Ken Jeong). Stu (Ed Helms) is funny but some of his scenes are forced. He's there to be the geeky normal guy who has abnormal things happen to him. Phil (Bradley Cooper) is there to add physical appeal, magnetism and leadership to the group. It's an odd grouping, but it works to a certain extent.This 'man movie' is low-brow escapist humour based on the absurd conceit that ordinary straight American white guys who lead rather boring lives are, deep down, wild party animals who do the funniest and most amazing things when they get wasted in Vegas.The movie reflects the experience that most male moviegoers have had of getting wasted in their youth and doing stupid things. 'It wasn't really stupid after all! It was pretty cool!!' Sorry, but throwing up on the lawn is not the same as stealing a tiger from Mike Tyson.Part of the morality play at the heart of this movie is 'boys will be boys at a bachelor party' and 'you're not really responsible for what you do if you got so wasted that you can't even remember it'. The title is misleading, because the memory lapse doesn't come from alcohol but from ruphies. Most of us who have gotten wasted can (unfortunately) remember the stupid things we did. At the end, I was thinking that another part of this American morality play was this: 'nothing must ever be allowed to disrupt the bride's perfect wedding'.This movie took almost an hour to set up the hangover. Too long.",7,0,3,6 May 2014
Deepwater Horizon," Realistic disaster movie
","Peter Berg has produced an excellent disaster movie that tells the story of the destruction of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig. What is really extraordinary about this film is its sense of realism. You really do feel like this is how it must have been. There is nothing movie-ish, cheesy or off in this movie.Enough time is take in the film to build the disaster up so we know what's happening. Woven into the account of this huge disaster are enough human interest stories to make you care somewhat about these people. This is a guy movie, so you get Wahlberg, Russell and the others doing their thing on the rig. Not really a chick flick at all.Berg doesn't fail to point fingers, but I think more could have been said about oil rigs in general and the environmental disaster that ensued. Sure, you can blame individuals, or companies, but the real problem is much wider than that. WTF are we doing sucking up the earth's resources with rigs like this? The patriotism aspect of it, albeit muted, was a little strange to me. Americans somehow can feel patriotic about a monumental disaster like this. Not sure what that's all about.",8,0,0,15 January 2017
Gravity," A gripping space survival story
","If this is the first review you have read about this movie, please stop reading any further! Don't read any other reviews at all. Go into the theatre without knowing what happens. You'll enjoy it much more. It's not a predictable movie, so the surprise factor will be lost.Having started with that warning, let me get to it. This film blew me away. I left the theatre wondering whether I had just watched the best movie of all time. Almost 45,000 IMDb users have voted on this movie, and I agree with their collective wisdom this time. I'll give it a 9 for now, but I may raise my score to 10.We have reached the point where filmmakers can show us anything on the screen. Here this artistry is not wasted on trivials (eg superheroes, huge robots or monsters), but on the majesty of space, the beauty of our planet, and the wizardry of our technology up there.This is a little like watching a genuine IMAX film about space – but one that is actually gripping and not a bore. This is an action film par excellence, not a soporific documentary. There is not much dialogue. The plot is uncomplicated, and yet full of surprises. This film has you on the edge of your seat.At the same time, it felt completely realistic, although I understand some purists are pointing out the scientific mistakes. (Who really cares about that? It's a movie, for chrissakes.) The director (Alfonso Cuaron) essentially tells us the story of a huge space disaster devastating all of Earth's space infrastructure. We are shown the enormity of the disaster, with our glorious planet as the constant backdrop. The director also succeeds in making it the personal survival story of a woman caught up in this disaster.Bullock plays a remarkable character (Ryan Stone) who leaves you gasping at what is happening to her, both physically and emotionally. Space is a metaphor representing a beautiful but brutal and uncaring universe. Space is not her element, as it is for Kowalski (George Clooney). In this situation we long for the calm demeanor and competence of a Kowalski, but even he can't survive this one. She soon realises that she is on her own and no one is going to rescue her. (Surely, an important lesson to be learned?) We are alone with her in the middle of one of the greatest trials any human being could ever face. This ordeal is shown in bone-crunching detail. Physically, she is strong as hell. Emotionally, however, the situation has her swinging wildly back and forth, from idiot to competent, from victim to survivor, from despair to euphoria.The realisation that 'shit happens, so deal with it' is a profound one — a moment of rebirth. Most of us never truly get it. Our only choice really is how we deal with that fact.I'd go see this movie.",9,8,12,12 October 2013
Lone Survivor," The story of a mission gone wrong
","This was a fairly enjoyable, fast-paced action film. One of us found it riveting. The military culture and operations seemed quite realistic. No false notes there. They picked a half dozen of the hottest male actors around to play the roles here.The acting here was really good, especially by Wahlberg. He's become a good actor (within his type) but in this movie he truly excelled. They were all good.It essentially tells the story of a screwed-up behind-the-lines SEALS mission in Afghanistan. They get stupidly discovered and are then attacked by the Taliban. Their backup is unable to rescue them for a while. They die one by one, until only Mark Walhberg is left.Whether the action scenes actually did happen as portrayed is difficult to tell. Their ability to continue moving and to generally survive bullet wounds and harrowing cliff falls was astonishing and sometimes difficult to watch. It felt to me like suffering porn at times. It strained credibility, as did the willingness of a Afghan village to expose itself to mortal danger to help an injured American.To me, as a non-American, the elegiac feel of their battle deaths, and the survival of the protagonist at all cost, felt over the top. But I regretted their deaths, just like everyone else.However, it wasn't a bad movie. I'd give it about 7.5. If you can't stomach American patriotic schmaltz, stay away from this one.",8,0,1,1 January 2015
Star Trek," To boldly go
","What can one add to a review corpus consisting of more than 1,400 reviews and over a quarter million votes?? I grew up on this show. These characters, these actors, are a part of my life. Since the series was released in the late 1960s, not only have I seen all the episodes, I've seen each episode multiple times. I'm not an intense fan or anything, but the show was just constantly in rerun and I always enjoyed watching it. It's been part of my life for over 40 years. Even today I have an image of Spock hanging on the bulletin board in my office. This show fed my childhood imagination. You have to really wonder at the burst of creativity that produced the show in the first place and brought those particular actors together. I haven't seen a TOS rerun on Dutch television for quite some time (perhaps ten years or more?) Nor is it shown on the international cable channels. Even the Syfy channel doesn't show them. I think most young Europeans have never seen a TOS episode. And if they have, perhaps it was just a few. I'm sure the more alert ones are aware of the TOS as a cultural phenomenon, but they may not understand the true extent of it.When I saw this movie for the first time, it was in a Dutch theatre filled with people in their late teens and early 20s. How many of them really understood the references to Star Trek TOS? It's amusing to me to think of all those moviegoers watching this movie for its own sake, and enjoying it, but not really understanding this entire rich layer underneath.It's clear that the director and writers went to some trouble to recreate the look and dynamics of the actors from 40 years ago, but imagined about ten years younger than in TOS. I must say that they succeeded spectacularly. For me, this is what the movie was all about. Abrams, Orbi and Kurtzman, and the various actors involved, are not even old enough to have seen the series from the beginning. They must be geniuses.I like the fact that the individual actors each added something different to their characters. Of course, it doesn't have to be (and cannot be) exactly the same. Perhaps it's impossible to recreate Star Trek TOS as it was. It's a new age. Indeed, many doors slide open now. We all have communicators now. Movie-making has changed too.The plot was rather complicated, as you can see from the length of the synopsis. I cannot say that the plot itself was that original or amazing. This was not the strength of the movie. Also, the film was rather too filled with ponderous space scenes showing the time gate and the various ships. Now that they've revived the original characters, I hope they are able to return the movie franchise to concept-based themes and the wry dialogue of TOS. TOS was ultimately a drawing-room drama with ensemble acting, not a Star-Wars thriller. One of the strengths of the show was occasionally using the future to cause the viewer to reflect on present day issues. The last thing this should develop into is a series of huge Avenger-style action movies. TOS blew us away for different reasons. It was really great that they were able to integrate the older Spock character into the movie. (Neither the new Spock nor the old Spock were exactly unemotional though, were they? We all know the Vulcans still have repressed emotions, but that's not what they are all about. It's always disturbing when a director decides to show us how emotional Vulcans really are.)Eric Bana played a different sort of role for him: a crazy, tattooed yahoo thug in control of a monstrous spaceship and with a grudge strong enough to last a lifetime. I thought it was great, and the look really suits him.They weren't gentle with the franchise. They've created a different time line, so not everything is the same as in TOS. And my god — they destroyed Vulcan! Six billion Vulcans dead in the blink of an eye. We'll have to wait until 2013 to see where it goes.",9,0,2,29 November 2012
Fury," Blood, sweat and tears
","This is somewhat of an overwhelming movie. It shows the last 'total war' at its most desperate. We see -- no, we smell – the excitement and the horrors experienced by a single tank crew. This movie jolts you into realizing that much of what we've seen on the screen over the last 70 years about this war has become cliché. Most of those who lived through the war are dead and we can now dare to imagine what it really must have been like and tell stories that we didn't dare tell before. These men were both heroes and 'inglorious basterds'. Surely that's the way it was. The movie clichés are trotted out and then dealt with brutally.A cinematic decision was made to show everything. In modern times, we need to see this to understand what total war is like. These are the things your granddad and dad refused to talk about. But if you're squeamish, be warned. Further, this movie provoked a huge emotional response in me. Bring a hankie. Yes, sweat, blood and tears -- this movie is an experience.I have never seen armoured operations, tank battles and tank activities so well depicted on film, However, the German military seemed strangely ineffective at times. I suppose this was to give the film dramatic tension and showcase our heroes. It felt artificial. Pitt and Lerman are very good, but it was Shia LaBoeuf who really shone. What a fine actor. This was a larger than life tank crew (something unavoidable when Pitt and LaBoeuf are in your tank). It bothered me a little that this crew was so ragtag and maverick. Hollywood loves this kind of thing, but it is not realistic. Some of the scenes involving the interaction between the sergeant and the newbie also seemed unrealistic. But the decision to tell this story more or less through the eyes of Lerman's character was brilliant. Sensitive, intelligent, conscientious, not combat trained, lacking acculturation to military life and battle, his main asset is the ability to type 60 words a minute. Now if this doesn't speak directly to the hipster-reddit-twitter generation, nothing does. Norman Ellison is a young man from the 2010s, not the 1940s. It worked very effectively. I'm glad they referenced the Falaise Gap. Now THAT might be a movieHighly recommended!",9,4,9,1 November 2014
The Maze Runner," I know...
","I know, let's have a movie where a group of young men ends up on an island. They don't know why and they can't remember anything. They figure out how to survive and they have this society. Yes, like that book I read in high school. What was it called? But they're there for years and there's no way out. They are all fit, hot young guys, and they fight with each other and hang out together. Like they're on a Survivor show or something. What? Yeah, just guys. They try to get off the island but there are these sharks out there. - - - Really? OK, not an island surrounded by water, but an island surrounded by this huge stone walls. It's like a big box. It's like that island in — what was it? — that movie with Di Caprio. They're in the middle of this enormous jungle. No, wait, let's make it a maze. Yes, that's it. The island, or village, or glade, or whatever you want to call it, is in the centre of this huge frigging maze. The maze is behind these enormous walls. Nobody knows who built it all. But it can't be a normal maze. That's too boring. Oh, I know. The maze is constantly changing. The walls can crush you. And the maze has these, um, borg scorpions. Yes, that's perfect. Borg scorpions. Huge, fast, and with stingers. The stingers don't kill you though. They sort of change you. A village surrounded by monsters, like that movie -- what was it called again? By the guy who did Sixth Sense. So we get this new kid, he's sort of like Katniss from Hunger Story, or whatever it was called. He's like there to rescue everyone. He figures it all out. Can we get that guy from Teen Wolf? He's sort of hot. And he's a pretty good actor too. Make sure he gets some gym time though. He's like that hot guy from Divergent, what was his name? Divergent was sort of cool, wasn't it? This kid is like a Divergent. Yeah, that's it. He doesn't want to be a Builder, or Artist, or whatever it was. He wants to be a Runner and fight the borg spiders. He's different, and is going to rescue them. The weird thing is that some of them have grown to like the village, yeah, even though there are no girls. So they don't want to leave. So they have to oppose this kid. They don't trust him. And we need a fat kid, like that island book, and like Stand by Me. Everyone likes him, and it'll be really sad when he gets it. And make sure there's an Asian guy, an Indian guy, and the whole thing is run by this supercool black guy. OK, now we have to figure out who built all this and why. Or should we make it all a big dream sequence? Or keep it a mystery, like in Lost. And how do we make this a sequel? They can't just stay in the village, right? They have to get out, like in that other village movie. What happens then?",7,0,1,1 October 2014
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Why did I fall asleep?
","I can't give a movie a high score when it has this effect on me. I asked my young friend what he thought, and he said the film had him on the edge of his seat. Surprising, because I was doing my best to turn my seat into a reclining bed. But why did I have this reaction? I saw the first SW in the theatre decades ago, and I've seen most of the movies since. Without being a SW geeks, I have as many viewing hours invested in the Star Wars universe as the next guy. But to be honest, I'm just not that interested in it. A lot of it is confusing to me now. It isn't intellectually exciting.Everything in, and about, this movie seemed artificial to me. None of it felt natural.I wasn't engaged with the characters at all. There was absolutely zilch in this movie to move me. I want emotional engagement, and this movie failed to deliver. Child separated from her family. Nothing. Young woman reunites with dying father. Nothing.There was just nothing new in this movie. It lacked originality. I felt like I had seen it all before. Am I too jaded for this film? Although I keep going to fast-paced action films, I'm not particularly into them. I dislike movies with hardware, explosions, gun fights and chases. This movie was all about that. Annoyingly, the theatre was full and I went to the movie with a friend who was sitting beside me. I couldn't play on my phone during the chases and shootouts.How is it possible that this movie has done so well in the box office? What phenomenon am I missing? I suppose action-craving boys and young men are most of the voters on IMDb. I think maybe I'm just in the wrong demographic. But even many of the critics like this one though. What did they see in it??Strangely, I loved Passenger and Arrival -- two movies that are not as well received as this one. It boils down to me disliking the action element. I wonder if this has to do with me never having played video games. If I remember correctly I think I had pretty well the same reaction to the previous SW movie.",6,4,9,15 January 2017
This Is the End," Very funny
","This is a Hollywood buddy flick (the actors playing themselves) set during the apocalypse.When was the last time you went to a movie and laughed heartily and unselfconsciously during the entire movie? That is what I did when I saw this film. It might have helped that when I went in knew absolutely zilch about it. This movie was a pleasant surprise.Words to describe this film: funny, unpredictable, light-hearted, irreverent, extremely profane, gross (at times), over the top, a little gay, clever, and strangely uplifting.By the way, I'm not in the right demographic at all: the many drug and masturbation references sort of put me off. It didn't matter. I still laughed. I have to see it again to catch the many cameos I missed the first time around. Canadian humour at its best and raunchiest.",8,2,6,16 July 2013
Alien: Resurrection," 'I thought you were dead.' Ripley: 'Yeah, I get that a lot.'
","We are 200 years after the last Aliens movie. Ripley (long dead) lives on in clones grown by evil military scientists on a space station for the purpose of hosting alien babies. Yes, these stupid humans see aliens as a species to be exploited.One Ripley-like clone (not quite human, well played once again by Sigourney Weaver) knows better. When all goes wrong (as she and you know it will), she's joined by a hard-core mercenary crew (including Winona Rider and Ron Perlman) in an effort to escape the doomed space station.Despite the time leap, this movie captures the spirit of the first and second films. Weaver is great, as are the rest of the cast. Lots of gore, near misses, slimy alien craziness. The clones and crossbreeding were suitably horrifying. Well executed, some good lines, some interesting scenes, a few real surprises. There are some scenes here that are difficult to forget. It's all steel, weaponry, toughness, sweat.This movie impressed me 20 years ago, and I enjoyed it again just now. I'd give it an 8, but I'm rounding it down to 7 because, well, it's the fourth in the series and I'm tired of it. I don't think they need to do a fifth film. Ripley, rest in peace....finally.",7,0,0,23 August 2015
World War Z," Zombie swarming
","I rather enjoyed this film, even though it is yet another example of the tedious zombie/vampire genre that has had Hollywood in its grip for years now.What makes these zombies different from the others (the many others) that we've seen is that these ones grow in numbers exponentially, become fast and difficult to kill, have an insatiable desire to infect others, and swarm aggressively. This effect is possible partly because it takes only 12 seconds for them to make the transition.And when they swarm, my gosh, is it terrifying. The filmmakers have done an excellent job in showing that. It's not particularly gory, but it is visually exciting nevertheless. With a virus like this, it doesn't take long for a city to be overcome.I had three problems with the film. I couldn't catch some of the dialogue, so some important explanations seem to have escaped me. It's still not clear to me why Israel built walls. The only wall I saw was one surrounding Jerusalem. Also, was I the only one to be bothered by the fact that the plague remained undiscussed and unexplained for so long? I suppose the advantage of this is that the moviegoer has the same sense of confusion as the characters. We've reached the point where explanations about zombies are apparently unnecessary. Finally, there were a few plot holes and unrealistic aspects. Where for example were the child zombies? The elderly zombies? The obese zombies? Why was the Brad Pitt character the only one able to do anything? The writers seem to have a very inflated view of what the UN is capable of.Still, it was a pretty good movie. In my theatre there was clapping at the end.(I've just read some of the other reviews, many of which seem to be written by Americans who are really, really into zombies and people who want gore in their movies. I can't relate to these other reviewers.)",8,1,6,1 July 2013
Passengers," A really good movie
","I went to see this film, despite the negative comments about it.I'm so glad I did because this is a good film. It tells the story of Jim Preston, a man who is accidentally woken up from hibernation 90 years before a transport ship is due to arrive at its new world. Because he wasn't part of the crew, he didn't have access to the ship's controls.The ship is surprising and imaginative. The story is interesting and well paced. The visuals are very well done. I was waiting for the critically foretold bad ending, but I thought the ending was good.I'm sort of p*ssed off with those who have been panning it. Don't listen to them. It's a shame this movie has attracted so much negativity. Go see it.",8,7,15,27 December 2016
The Hunger Games," Hunger Games, the movie
","This movie is science fiction set in a distant future in which part of North America is divided into 12 zones, with some zones wealthier and more advanced than others. Television still plays a huge role in this future society. Television producers are able to create elaborate fantasy worlds.For historical reasons, each zone is required to select a young man and young woman to participate in a reality show that is essentially a mutual hunt to the death combined with an escape from deadly special effects. The story focuses on the experiences of one engaging and attractive young couple from a particularly poor district.This interesting future world and the grand theatricality and drama of the 'hunger games' are gradually revealed in a way that allowed me to get caught up in it. I enjoyed seeing how they imagined the future would look and how such a show would be mounted. The characters were extraordinarily attractive and the movie was visually appealing. The movie was fast paced and I was curious to see where it would lead.The character development of the Katniss character was good and the role was believably and well played by Jennifer Lawrence. She was the focal point of the movie (perhaps at the expense of the other characters). I ending up caring about what happened to her and there were a few places where I was emotionally affected by her experiences.Every movie has flaws though. Most of the characters were two-dimensional. Some aspects of this future society, including the technological capabilities of the show producers, bordered on the unbelievable.After looking at the discussion boards, I've discovered that this movie is part of a teenage phenomenon. Many young people see themselves as cognoscenti because they've read the books. They are explaining the movie in light of the book. It seems many fans don't want this movie to be taken at face value -- they want viewers to read the book and they want the movie to be interpreted in that light.Also, some young fans are apparently troubled by comparisons between this movie and earlier movies, between this movie and earlier cultural themes and concepts. Of course, they want the Hunger Games phenomenon (including the movie) to be seen as something fresh and new in our culture.I think we have to remember to respect the fact that a movie is a separate work of art. Books and movies are different media. The book will reveal more detail, including the thoughts of the characters. A movie is much more of a visceral, visual experience. A movie may be loosely based on historical facts or a book, but it will not be the same. And nor should it be. Hunger Games the book and Hunger Games the movie are two different things. They are approached differently. It's not really useful to explain the 'real' story behind the movie. There is no real story. The movie is what it is. It stands on its own, separate from the historical events or book that gave rise to it. This doesn't effect the validity of the original book or historical events, of course. They can all be enjoyed, but in a different way.Also, many books and movies reflect earlier books, movies and themes that have arisen in our culture. This is a good thing and enriches the experience. Every book and movie will have to rely on artistic elements that went before. Some fans don't want this movie compared to the 'Truman Show', for example, which was a fantastic, original movie. The movie 'In Time' also had a future world where people were forced to live in districts with disparate wealth levels.The fans particularly don't want the Hunger Games compared to gladiatorial combat. But to me that's what this movie reminded me of, especially the chariot entrance into the stadium. It was essentially futuristic gladiatorial combat aimed at teenagers. Clearly this is what the author intended or the country wouldn't have been called 'Panem'.It didn't escape my notice that there was not much difference between the 21st century moviegoers and the futuristic audience watching the Hunger Games live. Perhaps not surprisingly, the morality of of sadistic voyeurism was a theme not explored in this movie. This movie might have been improved by the realistic depiction of gore. The violence here, despite being the core of the movie really, was of the goreless Hollywood variety. True gore is too difficult for most people to watch. For me the unrealistic violence mitigated the horror of the situation and the underlying moral point.Hunger Games seems to be aimed at a generation that has grown up watching survivor, reality and game shows where people get 'voted off'. 'You are the weakest link -- Boom!'I enjoyed the movie (but only for what it was) and would recommend it to anyone.",8,2,7,28 April 2012
The Impossible," Not just a disaster flick
","It's psychologically difficult to imagine the scale not just of the 2004 tsunami itself, but of the human suffering it caused. The only way to grasp it really is to focus on individual stories (remembering that millions of people each have a similar story).In this movie we follow what happened to an ordinary (British?) family, Maria, Henry and their three young sons. The depiction of the tsunami not long after the start is harrowing and at times difficult to watch. You cannot help but wonder how on earth they could have filmed those scenes (or created them using computer graphics, if that's what it was).Fortunately this is an intelligent, sensitive film that does not attempt to recast these events as a cheesy Hollywood disaster film.For the rest of the movie, we follow the family members to see whether they have all survived and, if so, whether they can find each other in the post-disaster confusion that followed.The performances here were all first rate. Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor are fine actors, and they deliver worthy performances in this film. The scene in which Ewan McGregor breaks down while calling his family moved me to tears. Some superb acting there. Tom Holland also shows much promise as a young actor.If this movie has a fault, it's in its unrelenting tugging at the heart strings. 'Suffering porn' and 'shamless tear-jerking' were the phrases that came to mind while I was watching parts of it, although in hindsight perhaps that is quite unfair. The director had to walk a fine line in creating a film like this. After all, a quarter million people died, and many, many others had far more devastating experiences than this family.The film succeeds magnificently in showing us a little what it must have been like to live through this tragedy. (However, I haven't read the other reviews so I don't know if the survivors feel that way about the film.) Ultimately, this is not so much a story about the tsunami as a story about a family's love for each other.",8,4,5,18 February 2013
Argo," Gripping historical drama
","If you enjoy gripping historical dramas, you'll enjoy this film. This movie is intelligent and edge-of-your-seat riveting.It tells the story of the 'Canadian Caper', the joint covert rescue by Canada and the CIA of six American diplomats who evaded capture during the Islamist seizure of the United States embassy in Tehran, Iran, in November 1979. Most of the other hostages had to endure 444 days of captivity, but three months into this ordeal America was delighted when it was discovered that six had managed to hide in the Canadian embassy and to make their way out of the country.Yes, there are a few liberties, changes, omissions and embellishments in the movie, but this was mostly for dramatic purposes, and the result is a movie that manages to combine historical accuracy with drama. Only once did the drama lapse into unrealistic melodrama: the take-off scene. It's clear that the director went to great lengths to try to replicate things as realistically as possible. It was a messy complicated event, so some details had to be smoothed over.For an American movie with a political theme, I found it to be relatively neutral, balanced and not overtly anti-Iranian; however, you may wish to pass if you're an Islamist or an Iranian nationalist. Some of the police/immigration scenes reminded me of Midnight Express. We all know that Iran is a great country that has only temporarily lost its way.I also am quite certain that if this movie had been made by Canadians, it would have shown more of the pivotal roles played by Ken Taylor and the other Canadians who risked their lives. Perhaps we'll see a movie some day about Ken Taylor's spectacular evacuation of 850 Canadians from Tehran in January 1979. (But would Americans go see it...?)This is surely the movie that will confirm in everyone's mind that Ben Affleck is not only an accomplished actor, but also a good and perhaps even great director. Perhaps we already knew that from 'The Town'.I would rate this movie as 8.5, but this is a movie for which the score deserves to be rounded up.",9,1,2,18 November 2012
Star Trek Into Darkness," Enjoyable and with great special effects, but too hectic and lacking in character development and the original Star Trek spirit
","This is a fast-paced, action-filled Star Trek movie roughly based on the Kahn story. Special effects are a big part of this movie, and they are truly spectacular.The second great thing about this movie is that the TOS characters have been brought back to life as their younger selves. All of the actors (including Pine) have done a marvelous job with this.I enjoyed the first half of this movie more than the second half. The film more or less fell apart for me when the villain was introduced. I was surprised and dismayed that Abrams had decided to revive Khan, which in my view has been done to death. Also, I didn't really like this particular villain. (He reminded me a little of the ridiculous Bane character in The Dark Knight Rises.) The story line involving this character was too far-fetched and complicated.Also, I still have a hard time accepting Pine's Kirk. This is an interesting Kirk, but it is a Kirk who has no gravitas, no military bearing, no judgment, no leadership. He commands zero respect. He could not command a rowboat, never mind a star ship. And yet we're expected to believe that Star Fleet (not to mention his highly trained crew) would allow him to do all these things. Sorry, it's just not believable. In TOS, one of the issues was that Kirk was constantly beaming away from his ship rather than sending other people to do the exploring. Abrams and his writers ignore this problem. As discussed extensively for decades by Star Trek fans, a captain should be with this ship. This Kirk is never with his ship. He seems to have no relationship with his ship at all. He gives the impression of not being an explorer at all. I think a mistake has been made in not developing the characters more fully. The three-way dynamic between this new Kirk, this new Spock and and this new McCoy should be given time to develop. In TOS, the various characters developed slowly, and were revealed to the television-viewing audience, as the episodes progressed.Another issue is that the quirks of each character were, well, just quirks. Kirk's bad-boy side, Spock's internal struggle with his emotional side, Spock's annoying reliance on logic and regulations, Bones's orneriness and contrariness, Scotty's overprotectiveness of the ship – well, these aspects were not what these characters were all about. Abrams and his writers have turned these quirks into personalities. It's like their personalities have been warped out of shape by these quirks. It's not realistic, and somehow disrespectful of the original show. You can't have a captain who is always a bad boy, an engineer that quits whenever his ship is threatened, a ship bay's doctor who argues and complains about every single damn thing.The same applies to the relationship issues between Spock and Kirk, between Spock and Bones, and so on. These relationships are merely side issues in the lives of these space explorers. It's overdone in the movie. Besides, these characters are too young to have grown into these relationships.For the love of Pete, Spock is supposed to be a Vulcan. Stop obsessing about his emotional side. Let the new Spock develop his character as a proper Vulcan. Right now I don't know what to make of him. He hardly seems Vulcan at all.I recognized and appreciated the various references in the movie to the TOS episodes. However, some of them were annoyingly not consistent with the Star Trek universe. Also, it is generally dissatisfying to see earlier episodes and movies redone. I hope Abrams abandons that approach. I want to see new, original ideas. I do not particularly want to see TOS incidents and episodes rehashed. The minute I knew this was a Khan remake, I knew he would either end up in stasis again or be deported to an isolated world with the other supermen. If Abrams wishes to make Star Trek relevant to a new generation, he should do it without hollowing out old TOS plots.It bothered me that Abrams dragged Nimoy back into this. I actually groaned aloud when he appeared. Is new Spock now going to contact old Spock every time he gets into a pickle? Finally, this movie was too hectic. Star Trek is not primarily about action, space hardware, chases and shootouts. Nor is Star Trek about special effects. Star Trek is thought-provoking, idea-based science fiction set in a future when want, war and money have been eliminated and the Federation is exploring the galaxy. Star Trek does not have to be about conflict and action. I hope Abrams and his team can see that. I'm not really into action movies, and I'm certainly not into shootout and chase movies. It would be a shame for the franchise to go in this direction.There were a number of other things in the movie that didn't work for me, but it seems petty to list them in detail.Sure, I enjoyed it well enough, but it did not blow me away and it left me with a bad feeling about where this is going. They may be destroying the spirit of the franchise to make money from a generation of viewers. The sad part is that these moviegoers will think that this is what Star Trek is all about. I know it will be hard to ignite the imaginations of a modern, jaded, cynical, internet-and-video-game-addicted audience. There are already many action and superhero movies out there. Star Trek should go in a different direction.",7,1,6,19 May 2013
Ted," You might like it if you like Family Guy
","I hemmed and hawed for five minutes before going in to see this movie. I hadn't heard anything about it, and the poster made it look like a children's movie. However, I didn't want to wait too long for the next film and I noticed Seth MacFarlane had directed it -- so I took the plunge.For the first 20 minutes I was worried I had made a mistake. The only other person in the theatre was a kid. Then the movie took a strange direction and gradually morphed into a Family Guy kind of film. (It took me a few years to warm to Family Guy, but I'm at the point now where the oddball humour entertains me somewhat. And there are times when the show is brilliant, especially in scenes involving the Stewie character.) I'm afraid however that I did not really fully appreciate most of the writing and humour in this film. I just didn't find it that witty or funny. The gratuitously offensive jokes and the toilet humour fell flat for me. It was supposed to be irreverent, but much of it just seemed stupid. Perhaps I was in the wrong mood.However, I did enjoy the original premise at the core of the movie (once I accepted its lack of realism) and some of the gags that arose out of it. I was also impressed at the technical wizardry.I had problems with the casting of Mark Wahlberg as John Bennett. I'm a fan, but he is too old, too hot and too worldly to play a 35 year old loser. I don't see him as the Peter Pan figure that the script calls for. In general, I didn't really appreciate this character's quirks. It was forced. Wahlberg pulled it off I suppose. He has a wider range than people give him credit for. I saw Lori (played by Mila Kunis) as just being annoyingly demanding. I thought that Wahlberg and Kunis were a hot couple, but they were in the wrong roles and the wrong movie together. Giovanni Ribisi was good, as always.I was put off by the constant drug and alcohol indulgences of Ted and John. I mean, look at what John looks like: this is a guy who would be into the gym and into his health.I am not quite sure how a young teenager could be allowed into the theatre to see this film. I'm not a prude, but I suppose there are no age restrictions anymore. A lot of the material and language in the movie seemed inappropriate for children, especially the anti-semitic and homophobic humour.If you really enjoy Family Guy, I think you might enjoy this film though.",6,0,3,1 August 2012
Finding Nemo," Entertaining
","This latter-day Disney movie is a classic after only ten years. The plot is straightforward: father loses son; father goes on quest to find son; father finds son.The two complementary underlying messages are 'give your kids room to grow' and 'listen to your father because he loves you'. There are some serious moments in the film.The real star of this movie is the incredible animation. The artists at Pixar have brought the reef to life, infusing the animations with eye-catching colour, light and movement.Another hallmark of the animation is the charming anthropomorphism of the underwater creatures. The characters are all denizens of a rich underwater kingdom. Poor Dory almost steals the show, but several other characters also stand out.The third underlying message (and one that is sorely needed) is that we should love this beautiful world and do what we can to protect it. Sadly, it looks now like we'll lose it all in a few generations.A clever, funny, entertaining Disney film. Not just for kids. This movie is considered to be the 10th best Disney animated film, but I think it should be rated higher. I think it's worth about 8.5, but I'm willing to round it up for now.",9,0,1,14 January 2014
Alexander," A great flick
","Go see this movie. It's interesting and intelligent. It's a great movie experience. I read a good many of the reviews here before seeing the film so I had a few trepidations going in. But after actually seeing it for myself, I really don't understand all the negativity.I felt the movie was the right length and I had no problem following it. The acting was excellent. I don't understand the criticism of Angelina Jolie. She was given the role of the intense, scary, slightly crazy 'barbarian' mother and I thought she played it perfectly. The accents were not an issue for me at all. The special effects and battle scenes were impressive, believable, suitably gory and exciting.I was intrigued by Stone's exploration of Alexander's psychology and especially his relationships with Olympias, Hephaistion and Roxane. I appreciate this kind of psychological insight into a dry figure from history. Stone's references to Greek myth and his choice of Ptolemy as narrator were also interesting and appropriate.A final point about the homosexuality. It seemed to me that in this movie the homosexuality was treated quite appropriately. It's indeed jarring to many of us 23 centuries later (especially in conservative America) to see how homosexuality could have been so routine, especially in a warrior society. Stone's treatment of it never felt uncomfortable or ridiculous. What would have been ridiculous, of course, is for Oliver Stone to make a movie about Alexander and not deal up front with this aspect of Alexander's life and times. Kudos to Stone for having the guts and intelligence not to shy away from this topic, although I suppose it cost him millions.Anyway, like I said, don't let this one pass you by.",9,1,8,1 January 2005
Brokeback Mountain," Profound, cathartic, important
","This is a beautiful, simple film about a lifelong romance between two closeted men raised in a homophobic culture. Yes, it's a movie about coming out of the closet and about homophobia, but more importantly it's a movie about finding true love and being true to your feelings.The morning after their passion erupts, they tell each other they're not gay. The second night, they embrace once again and accept what they are. This is the true coming out. No, it's not just about sex.It is crucial that this movie was shot in God's country, and the love that burst through here occurred between two attractive, masculine men in the prime of their lives. Gay love is everywhere and it will always find its way out.All relationships are different. The story of what happened to Ennis and Jack is particular to them and not true for all gay men. Both of them were unable to complete the process properly (after all, it was 1963), but Ennis in particular was almost crippled by his mental blocks and social constructs. His closet became of his own making. Thankfully most in the West now don't have so much difficulty with it. What rang true in the movie were the powerful and painful experiences of coming out, finding love and fighting prejudice. It's unbearably sad that self-hatred and homophobia have choked so many millions of people from leading fulfilling lives. In a sense, this movie is a clarion call for perhaps the greatest liberation movement in modern times. This movie said to me: all the sh*t you put up with, all the things you missed out on, all the difficulties and disappointments -- it was worth it because what matters most is Brokeback Mountain.This movie touched me deeply. The second time I saw it, the ending was so moving to me that I started weepinguncontrollably. I kept crying during my walk home from the theatre. The floodgates really burst when I finally got home. How do you explain that? Catharsis? I still don't understand why this movie had this effect on me. No movie has ever done that to me before or since. The final scene with Ennis and Jack's jacket ('Jack, I swear...') is the most powerful image of lost love ever put on film. Heath, thank you.Not all gay stories are sad. Many gay men live happy, joyous lives without regret or trauma. For many of us, Ennis and Jack make it work.How can I rate this movie anything less than 10? Thank you Annie, Ang, Larry and Diana. And perhaps most of all, thank you Jake.",10,7,7,2 March 2014
Youth," Profound, beautiful, moving
","This movie is set in a Swiss wellness hotel. It's summer, and the mountain scenery is beautiful. The hotel (as grand hotels tend to do) has a rhythm and character of its own. The guests are performers, many of whom are struggling with past glory. They are withdrawn from the world here, and the director captures the beauty, limitations and artificiality of their retreat. Two of the guests, Fred and Mick, are elderly, and the movie focuses on them, especially Fred. (I must say Caine and Keitel played these roles extremely well.) Those who require action and a forward-moving plot may not like this film so much. If you think about it, only two things really happen in the film (although I'm not going to disclose them here). The rest of the film was a complicated portrait of a particular place, specific people and a certain theme.This cinematic portrait was painted with meaningful dialogue and beautifully filmed scenes. The scenes are varied and surprising -- sometimes surreal, sometimes whimsical, sometimes profound, sometimes banal.This idiosyncratic non-Hollywood movie has profound things to say about old age and life in general. I'm not sure that younger people will really get it. Art, fame, memory, beauty, love, the very meaning of our lives... It's a difficult movie to review because I'm not sure I've grasped everything. I've only seen it once. I suppose one message is to lead your life to its fullest, even in old age. Move forward, not back. Feel, don't talk.The beauty of the movie, the intelligence of the dialogue and the astonishing character development hammer home the movie's points in one devastating scene after the next.I thought the final song at the end would bring it all together, and after looking at the lyrics, I suppose it does. It is too moving for words. I have to see this movie again, but I'm almost afraid to go. This movie caught me at a vulnerable point.",9,3,7,17 November 2015
Suicide Squad," Entertaining enough
","Reading the other reviews, it seems many of those panning this movie are comic book fans who know the comic-book version of these characters and the various movies they have generated. They are deeply involved in the 'Marvel universe' and the 'DC universe'. Many of them seem to be deeply offended if a movie character differs from their expectations.Well, I'm not in that demographic and I'm not that deeply involved. I came to this movie as someone without that kind of baggage. It even appealed to me that no Marvel character was involved because I'm sick of those movies. I liked the fact that I didn't know any of these characters (well, except for the Joker).To me, this seemed like a typical comic-book movie. Lots of strange superhero-like characters, futuristic technology, action, fighting, explosions and so on.I thought it was a half entertaining film. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone of course, but I can't say I hated it (which is how I feel about any movie with Spider-Man, Iron Man, Captain America, Batman, etc.). This movie is not even close to being as good as Galaxy.",7,0,1,18 January 2017
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Action porn
","Well, let's start with an invulnerable, ultra-competent superhero. He's a good guy, with a team that's rooting for him. There are also the bad guys, with their team.There's the martial arts, of course. Not real martial arts, but fake movie martial arts. The film also has many shootouts (with various weaponry). It has quite a few serious chase scenes, too, with cars, planes, people, you name it. Usually they end in explosions. Everything ends in explosions in this movie. You've got lots of technical wizardry and huge sci-fi space ships. And the beautiful girl and the black guy. Clever and daring, but unimportant in the end.Oh yes don't forget the spy agencies with endless money and godlike powers. (However, there's always a rogue element in these agencies, of course. There's always something about them that is not really as it seems.) I don't remember the plot of the movie (even though it ended an hour ago), but I do remember the muscle gods, the endless kung-fu, the cool hi-tech hardware, the huge space ships, the chases, shootouts and explosions, and of course (spoiler alert) the good guys winning in the end. Samuel Jackson is in this movie. But you already knew that, didn't you. He's in every movie.Robert Redford is in this movie, too. Robert, what were you thinking...It's a new way of doing movies. It's entertainment for the body, not the mind or heart. It's meant to trigger the same reptilian part of your brain that responds to flashing lights, car accidents, loud noises and porn. Future directors will have to add more muscle boys, more explosions, more CGI and 3D, more chasing and fighting -– although it's hard to see how they could do that.I suppose movies like this are produced because there is a very big market for it. That's plain enough from the IMDb scores. The Russo brothers, writers and others can only be commended for producing a film that so many people think is awesome.The question is why does a movie like this get such adulation? It's one of life's mysteries, I suppose, like why do some people go nuts over watching basketball and golf. I suppose it's not so weird that the people who love these movies are exactly the kind who would never spend the hours necessary to do what their heroes on the silver screen are doing. It's vicarious reptilian fantasy fulfilment perhaps, but notched up with CGI to satisfy an internet and gaming-addicted generation and with a certain homoerotic element for the ladies.OK, this is not my genre at all. This is not my franchise either. But I've written about that before, so I'll spare you. I thought this movie was barely entertaining. It was not realistic, intelligent or moving at all. I enjoyed watching Chris Evans though, although I'd rather see him as another character.",7,1,4,21 April 2014
Life of Pi," Beautiful but unmoving
","I found this to be a beautiful, enigmatic and meaningful movie. In the end, the cinematography is what stands out for me. The landscape and village in India, the vividness of the shipwreck, the scenes of the ocean (and the wondrous things that occur there) and the algae island -- it was all quite beautiful.Ang Lee also did a fantastic job in showing how the main premise of the book (i.e. a boy stuck on a life boat with a tiger) could actually work. I simply couldn't buy into this metaphor until Lee showed it to me on film.It's astonishing how lifelike the computer-generated tiger was. The whole movie hinged on this. It worked brilliantly.How many of the beautiful images were real? It's so well done that I really do not know. It's possible that most of the movie was computer generated. A cartoon, essentially. If so, it was technically brilliant, but it leaves me wondering about the film going experience. What did I just see exactly? Related to that are my reservations about the realism of the ocean scenes. Beautiful, yes, but do such things actually happen on the ocean? I'm still not sure. I'd like to know.What was the religious message of the movie? We are told that it delivers a profound message, but I'm afraid I couldn't really get it from the movie itself. I don't mind a movie that makes you think, but should a movie have the effect of making you scurry to the internet to find out what it means? The metaphors here were too complicated.I suspect this movie might speak more to the faithful, or at least to people whose minds are still open to faith. I'm afraid I'm on the same side as appa and amma, and this movie did not convince me otherwise. This is a movie with a profound message, but it's a message I didn't quite get and I think I reject, the artistry notwithstanding.I have to add that, although I am easily moved, this film did not move me. It did not really evoke an emotional reaction in me (apart from wonder at the beauty). That's the main reason for my score. On this point the movie failed for me. Perhaps I need to see it again, but I didn't empathise with the main character (either the younger or older versions). I'm not sure why though.To me, the twist at the end complicated the movie enormously and raised disturbing issues. Yes, I would have preferred to see the movie about a tiger rather than the alternative, but how on earth does that relate to religion? I'm sorry, but I didn't get it. Yes, faith and your particular religion are choices, but so is the decision to reject faith and religion as superstition. And I long ago rejected the notion that the grandeur of nature, or the beauty of art, is proof of God's existence. That is nonsense.To be honest with you, if Ang Lee had filmed the alternative version in the same beautiful way, perhaps that would have been a good movie too. I might have preferred a more realistic horror-adventure film. Or is there some rule of cinematography that a movie like that would have to be ugly because of its theme? There is beauty in evil too.But I write this review as someone who has not read the book, so what do I know.",7,4,8,29 December 2012
Doctor Strange," 'Who are you in this vast multiverse, Mr. Strange?'
","As someone who is into neither Marvel action movies nor the apparently endless Marvel multiverse, and knows nothing about Dr Strange as a comic book character, I went to see this movie with a certain amount of trepidation.Lo and behold -- I enjoyed it. This one is not of the same ilk as the tedious Iron Man or Captain America movies. It's more like the Antman movie.The character of Dr Strange is interesting and (of course) well played by Cumberbatch. The other characters were also good. The film was easy to follow, requiring no prior knowledge of or familiarity with previous films. The plot was fantasy, but not too dumb. The writing was great, with lots of humour and zippy one-liners. The usual kung-fu, chasing, shooting and explosion scenes were not too off-putting (although that being said, there was plenty of action). There was one visual technique that was overused somewhat (i.e. the folding of space) but in general the visual effects were interesting and spectacular enough to please a jaded visual generation. I would not say this movie was insightful or moving, however. It wasn't that good, although there were indeed a few very nice moments.I would recommend this film to younger action-oriented movie goers, even those who are not into Marvel superhero movies.",8,1,1,27 December 2016
Interstellar," Rich, satisfying and gripping epic
","This is a rich, satisfying and gripping epic with several interwoven themes: father-daughter relationships, ecological collapse, survival, interstellar travel, alien worlds and more. The space scenes are beautiful, especially the worm hole, black hole and alien worlds.Matthew McConaughey is the emotional heart of the film, and he pulls it off beautifully (like the fine actor we all now know he is). I was deeply moved by a few of the father-daughter scenes. Anne Hathaway and the others were also good.OK, there were several aspects of the movie that did not feel quite right to me. They were jarring, and caused me to question what I was watching. Moreover, I can't say I liked the far-fetched deus-ex-machina ending. But, hey, what do I know about worm holes, event horizons, the fifth dimension and tesseracts. At times, this movie did feel somewhat like other space movies that have been made over the years. Having said this, these problems didn't ruin the movie for me, which I think is worth about 8.5 out of 10. The movie is almost three hours long, but it didn't feel tedious.",8,1,6,8 November 2014
Pacific Rim," Transformer-like robots battle alien water lizards
","This fairly entertaining movie is all about enormous alien water-lizard monsters fighting enormous Transformer-like robots. Sometimes they fight in or over the ocean; sometimes they fight in cities. When they fight in cities, the cities get spectacularly trashed.The plot revolves around the efforts of the international military/scientific force that operates the robots, and there are several side stories relating to that.As you can imagine, most of the movie is based on special effects, which are sometimes quite beautiful and spectacular. It's a modern action movie in every sense of the word. This movie will appeal particularly to those who crave sensational, loud, fast and smash-filled action. It's essentially a video-game movie. I thought the flashback scenes involving Mako were iconic and almost moving. This was the only time I was close to being moved during the film (rather than just sensationally titillated).They picked a beautiful man to play the lead role (Charlie Hunnam), and had him play a few scenes shirtless. Not quite sure what demographic they were going for there, but it certainly worked for me. The camera loves this guy.I had a few issues with certain aspects of the movie. The robot force was a strange mix of quasi-military people, scientists and martial artists. The phony, cliché and unnecessary militaristic dialogue bothered me. This was not really a military force at all, but yet they gave the characters lines like 'permission to be dismissed, sir'. Like most American movies, this movie is filled with groups yelling 'yes sir', something you usually only see in basic training in the real military. These movies also unrealistically turn pilots and generals into infantry soldiers at the blink of an eye.(A lot of movie makers nowadays have a strange notion of the military. They make it look like it is always a ragtag affair, with insubordinate behaviour and ill-disciplined mavericks playing a major role; however, at the same time they love the trappings of the military, especially the dialogue and ritualised social interactions. There are two lines in particular that indicate cliché cinematic writing: 'permission to speak freely sir' and 'permission to approach the bench your honour'.)The cliché portrayal of the scientists also rankled. It bordered on caricature. I didn't buy the relationship between Stacker and Mako at all. Stacker's dialogue was ridiculous at times. The character was ridiculous, although I suppose it was ably played. It made no sense that the leader of the force fighting to save the planet would get into the tank, so to speak, to fight the battle personally. But hey that's a problem in most movies now. Even presidents are expected to be able to fight in modern American movies.When did American movies stop even the pretense of showing things realistically?Once again, it bothered me that the world's youth -- most of whom are grossly unfit internet and gaming addicts -- are being entertained by portrayals of people who are the exact opposite: superfit military types who are experts in martial arts. Why is it that the people who enjoy movies like this are precisely not the types who go to the gym, enjoy fighting, train for hours, or join the military. No, they watch movies showing people who do these things. Does that bother you too? We live in a world where movie makers orient their products around soft gamers living out their fantasies vicariously. The problem is that the rest of us get caught up in this dynamic.This is not really a movie for adults, but it is a good example of its genre. If you like movies like this, I'm sure you'll like this one. It's not a movie for adults who worry about things like insurance rates, death tolls and marine environments, or who like to be moved by characters they care about.",7,0,6,15 July 2013
American Sniper," The story of Chris Kyle
","Setting the political issues aside, I enjoyed this movie. It provided insight into the life and culture of Chris Kyle, the Navy Seals, the American military in Iraq and Texas. They tried to instill conflict and a plot into the story in various ways, but this is essentially a biography with the focus being on several tours in Iraq. There's not much of a story to tell. The scenes in Iraq felt realistic to me and give me the feeling that I have a better understanding of what it was like there.About the political angle, I feel I have an open mind. I can enjoy a Michael Moore movie as well as movies like this. This movie definitely had a POV I may or may not agree with, but every movie has that. It didn't feel false or racist or manipulative or strident to me. It did seem to have a good deal of American jingoism. However, I was willing to forgive that because Bradly Cooper's performance made me feel sympathetic to his character. The bit at the end was a little too much for me, but I simply left the theatre a few minutes early.Is Chris Kyle a hero? I'm not sure. But I didn't need to think that to enjoy this movie. It's interesting enough that this guy has become an icon to many in America.I'd rate it about 7.5. If you're a Cooper fan you shouldn't miss this one.",7,2,15,25 February 2015
Lion," An interesting story, well told
","This movie is based on an interesting true story. The strength of this film lies mainly in its 'slumdog' portrayal of life in Calcutta for Young Saroo. But what made it also fascinating was the process of him getting so utterly lost as a child and then as an adult reversing the process by using modern technology to find out where he was from exactly. It really could easily have remained a lifelong mystery.I am a little uneasy with the romanticisation of Indian poverty. I wouldn't enjoy that in any context, so I don't understand why it is practically glorified in some movies relating to India. I simply don't need to see this in movies. I don't go to movies to see extreme poverty. There is nothing of merit in showing it.His reuniting with his mother was not so moving to me as it was apparently to some of the other reviewers. I found it mawkish. Don't get me wrong. I was indeed moved, especially in the light of his relationship with his birth brother. But it was a little too much. I felt emotionally manipulated.It's worth about 7.5, but I'm going to round it up.",8,0,0,16 July 2017
Ant-Man," An enjoyable Marvel movie for a change
","Surprise, surprise -- a Marvel superhero movie I actually enjoyed, really enjoyed even. I wouldn't miss this winner if I were you.The story is about a conflict arising out of the development of new miniaturisation technology. The inventor sees its destructive potential and tries to restrict it. But the evil protégé gets his hands on it and wants to exploit it. The inventor recruits a cat burglar who desperately needs to do something heroic to win back his daughter. The cat burglar learns to master this new miniaturisation power and tries to stop the evil protégé.The miniaturisation scenes were really, really good. Some of it was astonishing. I liked the pace and scope of the film, too. The humour and occasional campness was also much appreciated. It lacked the bombastic pretension and seemingly never-ending action of the usual Marvel films.Paul Rudd was funny, sexy and effective as a superhero. Michael Douglas was real and believable. Corey Stoll was deliciously evil.Was it a perfect movie? No. But the problems didn't ruin the movie for me.Go see this one.",8,7,19,4 August 2015
American Hustle," All form, not enough substance
","I'm one of the minority who didn't really enjoy this movie all that much. The laughter and clapping at the viewing I went to (in Florida) surprised me. I actually fell asleep for about 15 minutes during the first half.This is a movie that hinges on dialogue, character development, writing and setting. There were some amazing character-driven scenes in this movie. It's very strong on these points.As everyone has noted, the acting was astonishing. I enjoyed these performances, just as I enjoyed the 70s music. I'm glad I've seen Jennifer Lawrence's unforgettable performance as Rosalyn Rosenfeld. However, I'm wondering about the casting of Bale and Renner. They both did excellent jobs, but what is the point of taking actors to these strange places? I suppose part of my problem with this movie was that I simply didn't like these characters. All this talent and effort, just to show us the world of these unlikeable, pathetic people.Also, this movie had themes I have little interest in. Small-time hustling, sting operations, New Jersey, political corruption, the mob. If I had known beforehand that these were the themes, I wouldn't have gone.Despite the movie's strong points, especially the acting performances, I was never really engaged or moved by this movie. I can't rate it highly.",7,0,1,5 January 2014
Oblivion," Great sci-fi adventure
","I rather enjoyed this movie. I found the story to be intriguing and the film beautifully made. It particularly excels in showing us future technology and a devastated world. Cruise's performance was superb. The movie has a couple of neat twists, but I don't want to give them away.It continues to amaze me that filmmakers can produce movies with such incredible special effects. The special effects in this movie are indeed spectacular.If I have any complaint, it's that the film caters too much to those who go to the movies to see chase scenes and shootouts. For about 5 minutes, the movie actually morphed into a video game.Also, it annoyed me that Morgan Freeman was in this movie. He can be great at times, but he is grossly overexposed. I almost considered not going because of his presence.The current IMDb score is inexplicably too low. I checked out a few earlier reviews to see why. Reading some of these reviews, it seems that the lower scores hinge on three factors: (1) the presence of Cruise; (2) the similarity to other movies; and (3) lack of realism.It seems there are some people who atavistically dislike Cruise and wish he would abandon Hollywood and stop making movies. I get that. But regardless of what you think of Cruise, he remains a talented actor; he shows here he can easily and convincingly play the lead role in an action-adventure movie. (Come to think of it, I cannot think of a recent movie in which Cruise has not excelled.)It's more or less impossible now to produce any movie that does not remind moviegoers of earlier films. All movies are derivative, to a certain extent. And to give this movie a '1' for that reason is unfair. This movie is absolutely not a ripoff of 'Moon'. There was one similar plot device. That was it. And even if movies are similar, so what? References and allusions are standard in any medium or genre. They give a movie depth.Some reviewers have dissected the movie to look for aspects that are less than completely realistic. However, I noticed none of their points while watching the movie. It all worked for me, and if something is truly unrealistic I notice it immediately. There was nothing that was so jarringly unrealistic that it ruined the film for me.I'd go see this one.",8,2,4,4 May 2013
Baby Driver," The story of Baby
","OK, I really dislike American action films that are about music, cars chases, shootouts and crime (in any combination). However, this movie was exactly that, and I rather enjoyed it. I think it's because this movie was really all about Baby (played by Ansel Elgort), an interesting, multi-faceted, sympathetic and attractive character. It's a dense, well-written, self-aware and overtly cool movie. There are some funny and unexpected aspects. Not a run of the mill film. I wouldn't miss it.",8,4,8,29 July 2017
Man of Steel," Entertaining
","I'm not sure what I can add to the 1,200+ reviews that have already been written about this film, except to say that I enjoyed this retelling of the origin of Superman. The filmmaker shows us a very strange and very beautiful Krypton. Advanced alien technology plays an important role in the film. This is not an aspect of the original comic at all -- but it worked well for me.I even enjoyed the city-destroying fight scenes between Superman and the rebel Kryptonians. The terraforming machines were suitably monstrous and terrifying. However, I do not like this usually and at times I felt there was too much of it. Very loud; very fast. This is not why I go to the movies. They could easily have made this a very different kind of movie, without all the shebang.I suppose you need a blockbuster like this now to entertain a game-obsessed generation. Our youth seem addicted to sensation. (As an older person, I kept thinking about how much the collateral damage would cost to repair, and how the insurers would go bankrupt. I also kept thinking that the people still hanging around the city after all of the destruction had progressed were incredibly stupid and deserved what they got. Note: if a huge alien object appears in the sky, get the hell out of town...immediately.) Because most of the movie is based on an alien world, and on massive city and world destruction scenes, the movie itself is largely the product of computer-graphic animation. It's astonishing to see what they can do now with that.But at times the movie slowed down and became a proper drama. These were the parts I liked the best.Henry Cavill is an impressive Man of Steel. He really gives the impression of not being an ordinary man. I suppose part of it is his sheer beauty. I have to admit I was disappointed by the final scenes. Henry Cavill as Clark Kent doesn't quite work for me (yet). He is the lobsterboat type.The filmmakers decided to give this character a psychological edge and an initially dubious reputation. It felt right to me, but this is more Batman and Spiderman territory. I think they should have stayed away from that for Superman, who is a fundamentally different kind of character. Michael Shannon was a suitable villain. He is an actor with remarkable range. I last saw him in 'Take Shelter', in a completely different kind of role.I was moved at times. The writing and acting were pretty good. The fathers (Kevin Costner and Russell Crowe) added depth to the film. I'm glad they included that. Amy Adams (as Lois Lane) was fine; however, I felt the relationship between them developed too quickly. That part didn't feel right. A few times I thought, 'this would never happen this way' (eg the hurricane drama); however, I was willing to let that go and move on.I would see this one. I'll certainly go to the sequel. I'd rate this film around 8.5, but I'm going to round it down because of the emphasis on destruction.By the way, I write this review as a long-time fan. My first Superman was George Reeves! I used to run home from school to be on time to catch the programme. I also used to spend 12 cents every month for the latest comic.",8,0,2,23 June 2013
Cast Away," Still entertaining after 14 years
","This is the kind of Hollywood movie I really like. I've seen it three times now, and after 14 years it is still hugely entertaining.Hanks is fantastic here. This role was perfect for him, and he really gives it his all.I suppose it's because I enjoy all castaway films; however, this is a particularly good one. Who hasn't dreamed of giving it all up and spending a long period on an island like this? To me, this movie is pure escapism. Unlike Chuck Noland, I'm sure I wouldn't need a Wilson.The main star in this movie is not Hanks, but the island of Monuriki, Fiji. I really wonder whether there is any island like this left in the world anymore.Has anyone been truly lost on a deserted island in recent years? Most castaways seem to be voluntary nowadays. Is something like this even possible in modern times? And aren't most beaches in the Pacific covered in garbage? We've already ruined it all, haven't we? I suppose I could have done without the FedEx promotion. However, this didn't ruin the film for me.I suppose it's all a metaphor for a harsh, uncaring universe. Sh*t happens, and when it does you have to get off your a*s, stop blaming the world, and make the best of it.This movie could not have gone wrong with Zemeckis at the helm, Broyles as the writer, and Hanks in the main role. Kudos to them all for this great movie. It's worth about 8.5. I can't decide whether to give an 8 or 9, but for now I'll round it up. I think of this as one of my favourite movies.",9,2,3,19 February 2014
The Revenant," A beautifully shot movie but it went on for too long
","I enjoyed this movie alright. On paper it had everything I love in a movie: beautiful scenery, good cinematography, adventure, the theme of man against the elements, a realistic portrayal of the fur-trading industry, native Americans and early 19th century America, and so on.The initial Indian attack and the bear attack were the most exciting parts of the movie. They were beautifully shot. Truly gripping. Must see! Di Caprio is an amazing actor, and he didn't fail to disappoint here.However, the film was a little on the slow side and it went on for a little too long.In the end, this was really just another American chase and shootout movie.The physical hardships that Glass went through evoked sympathy in me at first (especially the bear attack!) but then it seemed to be endless and this had a numbing effect on me. The phrase that came to mind was 'suffering porn'. I didn't really care what happened to him in the end. He was lucky to be alive at all.I suppose the themes included survival and fate. Not being in a philosophical mood when I saw this film, All I got out of it was that some people have horrible luck and yet survive it. The Job story, I suppose. I didn't have a feeling that there was a higher purpose for any of it.Another demerit for this movie: it didn't move me at all. There were plenty of powerful moments that should have moved me, but it just didn't happen.I want to give the movie 7.5. 8 feels too high, but 7 feels too low. I'm going to give it an 8 because it was a beautifully shot movie with many interesting aspects to it.",8,1,2,17 February 2016
Bridge of Spies," Ordinary lawyer goes to Cold War Berlin
","This is the story of James Donovan, who during the Cold War became a sort of secret negotiator for the American government in the trade off of Russian spy Rudolph Abel and American pilot Gary Powers.The portrayal of America during the Cold War is absolutely wonderful.Hanks's performance is excellent, as one has come to expect from the man. He is utterly believable, despite his fame.It helped that much of the movie takes place in Berlin, a city I love. Spielberg does a terrific job in showing Cold War Berlin and particularly the horror of the city getting divided.Don't believe those who are saying that the movie is too jingoistic. It's not. Spielberg and Coen don't avoid controversial issues. The movie-goer is jarred with a few thought-provoking comparisons and some gentle reminders of the difficulties of life and hypocrisies of that era. Much of the movie deals with the legal issues involved. Donovan, originally an insurance litigator, is the lawyer for the Russian spy.I have to give this movie 9/10 because I can't think of a single thing wrong with it. (OK, there is one thing: I can't say the movie really moved me that much.) This is movie-making at its best. Look at who is involved: Spielberg, Hanks, the Coen brothers, and so on. Don't miss this one.",9,7,12,17 February 2016
North by Northwest," Entertaining old film
","I'm feeling a certain amount of pressure to write a review worthy of what is apparently one of the greatest films of all time. Unfortunately, I'm not a cinematography graduate or anything...It's just a great old Hitchcock film, one that is still enjoyable to watch 55 years after it was made. One thing I liked in particular about the movie is how it showed a 1959 America that is sparkling and cool, functional and beautiful. Everyone was dressed up to the hilt. It's like a time machine.I was delighted by the seduction scene between Roger and Eve, especially Eve's sexy forwardness. No wonder Grant's character was bowled over. Saint's performance here was astonishing.Grant's too actually. A real old-school movie star, Grant carried the movie really well. He conveyed a suaveness, charm and sense of humour you just don't see anymore. Times have changed! The film had a fast pace and good story that made you wonder where it was leading and what was coming next. The dialogue is snappy, so you have to listen closely.The movie lacks the naturalness or realism you'd expect in a modern film (that doesn't involve superheroes or giant lizards). Every character was a character. It felt staged, as if every scene was meant to be iconic. There was a certain mannerliness and at times even a campness to it. Not a bad thing at all.Did this movie entertain me? Absolutely. It was entertaining on every level, really. Did this film move me at all? No. Did it have any depth or shed any light on the problems of this world. No.",8,2,4,13 April 2015
Hugo," Artistry and craftsmanship
","'Hugo' consists of three movies really. The first movie is the story of the orphan Hugo, his automaton and his mechanical secret world behind the clock. The second movie is the story of a Parisian train station ca. 1930, and its immediate environs, an impossibly charming and romantic place richly filled amusing Parisian characters and human interaction. The third movie is the story of Georges Méliès, apparently all true.Stripped to its bare essentials, the movie's theme is artistry and craftsmanship: the love of clockwork, the love of romantic places and the love of film. Each of these movies and themes has its own characters, plot and pace, but they are interwoven into a single movie. The movie is so rich I'm sure I missed much of it in my single viewing. 'Hugo' is the kind of movie that can be enjoyed by both children and adults. It's not a realistic adult world. There are no politics, no violence, no sex. There is a touch of slapstick, two dimensional characterisation. You'll enjoy this film more if you're at least a little in touch with your inner child. Hugo is a brave and precocious hero, having great adventures in a precarious world. Asa Butterfield played the role beautifully.But nor is it completely a children's movie. We come out of it with a much better understanding of early film-making. And the visual imagery is at times jaw-droppingly beautiful. And of course it makes you fall in love with Paris all over again, even if Scorsese's Paris is one of the imagination.This is an unusual and visually beautiful movie, something I wasn't expecting. It's more of an experience than a movie. Go see it. Go.",9,3,6,20 April 2012
Silver Linings Playbook," Bradley Cooper and a bunch of other people
","This movie was not a waste of money; however, nor did it bowl me over, as it did some reviewers here. It didn't move me. It didn't elate me. There were not that many laughs. I didn't particularly empathise with the characters. (But then I haven't read the book...) The best part of the movie was Bradley Cooper, who played Pat Solatano Jr. The camera loves this man. Like many leading men, Cooper does not have a huge acting range. He does his thing well, and doesn't mess with it. For example, in this movie his anger is central to the story, but the blowouts here were not shown with full emotional intensity. We don't see him truly lose it emotionally. However, I feel that in this movie Cooper did push his range to the limit. He delivered a fairly convincing performance of what it's like for a very, very charming and attractive man to be afflicted with bipolar disorder.I agree with everyone that Jennifer Lawrence's performance as the complex Tiffany character was surprising and quite good.The situation and dialogue at the Solatano household seemed jumbled and sometimes a little forced, with people talking loudly and at the same time. I suppose it's realistic when portraying a volatile Italian-American family like this, but I found it difficult to follow at times. I was also thinking that this is one family I would not want to move in next door to me.There were many detailed references to American football, bookmaking, and other aspects of American life that were sometimes difficult to follow (even for Americans, I suspect). Jackie Weaver was good, but Robert de Niro didn't really deliver. I don't know whether it was the character or the actor though. I just wasn't moved. The scenes where he got close to Cooper felt uncomfortable, although perhaps that's what they were going for. It seems difficult to tell Pat Solatano Sr apart from Jack Byrnes.I thought it was unrealistic that Pat Jr. would run into his therapist at a ball game, and that the therapist would later attend his dance performance. How many therapists would do that? The constant arrival of the same cop was also a little unrealistic.Finally, the movie was a little too predictable and a little too slow for me.Perhaps this review is overly negative. I wonder how much of my reaction is based on my discomfort about mental illness? Perhaps. It's a difficult subject to deal with without alienating the viewer.",7,1,2,12 March 2013
Divergent," Decent sci-fi flick for chicks
","This is yet another soft sci-fi movie for girls. However, I rather enjoyed it and think it's a decent film that anyone can enjoy.The post-apocalyptic story with its social and psychological angles was interesting, although far from gritty or realistic.I found the movie strangely moving on occasion although I'd be hard pressed to explain way. I suppose I identified with the main character.I enjoyed the eye candy, of course, especially Theo James and Jai Courtney.The bad points: The whole premise is artificial and seriously unrealistic and fuzzy on the details. I don't want to list the details but there are many. At times the movie becomes a little too melodramatic. Shailene Woodley was OK in her role but in real life she'd never survive. I think she was miscast.If you're like me, you'll spend a few edgy moments getting past that and if you're lucky you'll be able to enjoy the movie for what it is.The second half of the movie gets bogged down and has too many shootout and kung-fu scenes for my liking.

Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," Monstrous female creatures, ninja fighting, maximum firepower, 3D effects, gory deaths
","This movie is a fairy-tale remake with Tarantinoesque violence. If you're even remotely thinking of going to this movie, please get it out of your head completely that this movie is for children. Or faithful to the Grimm Brothers tale. Or historically or culturally accurate in any way whatsoever. Or logical and realistic. Wirkola's movie is about monstrous female creatures, ninja fighting, maximum firepower, 3D effects, and showing gory deaths in as many bloody ways as possible. The gore is not of the toe-curdling kind, but of the cartoonish movie variety. When a head gets squashed, the camera doesn't show the details or linger.The closest similar movie that comes to mind is Rodriguez's 'From Dusk to Dawn'. The emotional maturity and intellectual depth of 'Hansel and Gretel' are at about the same levels as 'Xena: Warrior Princess' or 'Hercules: Legendary Journeys', only this movie is a lot more violent and vulgar. Strangely, religion is almost completely absent from this witch movie. I suppose that would only complicate things. Our heroes have superhuman fighting skills, but this is not explained.The witches in this movie are theoretically not human women, but they were portrayed as hideous, deformed female humanoids who sort of looked like women, and they were all butchered with abandon and glee. The witches are frightening and have superhuman powers, but it didn't stop them from getting killed by the dozens. The political incorrectness of this movie was bothering me within the first five minutes. Has anyone else pointed this out already? Thank god they brought out the white witches. And the movie takes a stance against witch-hunts involving the phony witches or the good witches. You see, it's only the EVIL witches who should be burned alive, shot like dogs, or beheaded. This movie is meant to appeal to your lizard brain.Still it was sort of fun. And some of the Imax 3D effects were excellent. I actually ducked a few times.",6,1,4,13 March 2013
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Another latter-day spy movie
","I'm old enough to remember watching Mission: Impossible as a child. Gosh, those were great shows.But of course the world has changed immeasurably since then. So have the movies. Strangely, a lot of spy movies are all the same now. I have a hard time telling this modern reincarnation of Mission:Impossible apart form the Bourne films, the new Bond films, Safe House and a half dozen other movies you can easily think of.In these movies the security agency involved (usually the CIA, but not always) has incredible technology allowing them to visually track pretty well anything in the world. They can find any information they need in seconds. They have instant access to data bases you didn't even know existed. They can do anything really. Instantly accessible CCTV, internet and telephone tapping all play a huge role in these movies. There are always flunkies sitting at screens and then an intense older man or hard-nosed woman standing around shouting orders at everyone.These agencies seem to have endless cash and will not hesitate for a second to do anything. Send a team to Zurich! Deploy the jets to Zambia! Moreover, in these movies the agents often have superhuman intellectual and physical abilities, far beyond that of trained athletes and martial arts experts. They jump from roof to roof, get injured in the knee, smash their heads against doors, and yet press on. They all fight like Bruce Lee nowadays. They can fly helicopters, drive like stunt men, do daredevil tricks with motorcycles. They have superb memories, training in explosives, knowledge on how to disarm nuclear weapons. These people are not only highly trained, super fit, super smart sharpshooters trained in martial arts to an unearthly level, they're also sort of invulnerable. They're superheros really.And of course there's always a rogue element: it's always the case that someone has become, will become, or is suspected of being, not what he seems. The viewer is invited in virtually every film to try to figure out the twist. You can't trust anyone, can you. It's almost a rule now. Nothing is as it seems.These films are a combination of the 'Spy' and 'Superhero' or 'Martial Arts' genre, but with 'Science Fiction' technology thrown in. And the rogue element has some of the 'Mystery' genre in it. Also, in these American films there are almost always intense shoot outs and chase scenes. Everything happens very fast. Lots of crazy driving, crashes and near death escapes. That makes them 'Action' films. And of course they're shot in 'Exotic Locations' So let's rearrange the initials of all these genres to call this the 'MASSFLAMES' genre. It's really not right that so many of these movies are more or less exactly the same in tone and content.Anyway, this is that kind of movie. It was competently done. This was a very fast-paced movie, with one action scene after the next. I have to admit though that the shootouts and chases turned me off. It just didn't impress me that much. There wasn't enough of a story or enough character development. Tom Cruise was OK. Sean Harris was good as the creepy villain. The one who really caught my eye here was Rebecca Ferguson. Wow.There were even a few aspects that just seemed wrong to me. They shook me right out of my suspension of disbelief. No point in going into them here.I didn't hate the movie. It had a few visceral pleasures. If you're a teenage boy, you'll enjoy this movie. Although you could also just go to another 'massflames' movie. They're all the same really.",7,2,4,4 August 2015
Dunkirk," Don't miss this one
","So far, over 80% of the people who have rated this movie have given it and 8, 9 or 10. Deservedly so. This is an excellent movie that successfully shows first hand and close up what Dunkirk must have been like for those on the ground, in the air and on the sea.I don't want to gush too much about it, but the realism and cinematographic artistry are superb. This is a story of survival, after all, but it is a story that is so well told that it feels like time travel. I've seen so many movies about the 2nd WW during my life that I tend to avoid them now. But this one is different. It worked for me from beginning to end. I'm glad I saw this movie in an IMAX theatre with a great sound system because it really enhanced the experience. The sounds were visceral, more so than in any movie I've ever been in. So this is what it feels like to have a bullet crack near your head. Or to be strafed. Or to be be in an aeriel dogfight. Or to drown. (Some of the negative reviewers found this too loud, too realistic perhaps. So be warned.)Nolan has somehow captured the strange mix of selflessness and selfishness, cowardice and heroism, depersonalisation and intensive personal narrative that the military and war can bring out. Some reviewers have commented that there wasn't enough character development, but to me that lack of personalisation reflects what being in the military and a huge operation like this feels like.I felt the desperation and hopelessness. The sense of being trapped. The terror of being shot at. I was moved by the ending. Some reviewers are saying the film lacked emotion, but I didn't feel that. My friend says he wasn't moved at all though. Did these negative critics want more emotion from the soldiers? Screaming? Weeping? I don't think that would have been realistic.This movie wasn't too bloody at all, although I don't think I've ever felt more strongly the waste of war. It's too easy in these war movies to demonise the enemy and emphasise the bloodiness -- but Nolan did none of that. He didn't show the enemy or the carnage at all really. What he did show was the desperation and fear.This movie had a few minor issues, but I'll see it a second time before reporting on them in more detail. Right now, I'll just mention a few: Nolan didn't use CGI. I was surprised that there weren't more on the beach. Is this really what hundreds of thousands of men look like? I'm not sure this movie depicts accurately what it was like for so many to be trapped on that beach. Is this what 700 civilian boats look like? Why were there only a handful of aircraft in the air? Maybe CGI would have worked better here.  I sometimes had a hard time telling who was who.  I would have liked to have walked away from this moving knowing why Dunkirk occurred.  What happened to the 100,000 or so who were taken prisoner? This movie puts action fans in the same theatre as old fogeys. That alone is a major accomplishment. You have to hand it to Nolan. He almost casually and unnecessarily turned from his usual fare to focus on an historical war drama. The result is a compelling, excellent movie. Imagine if all these superhero directors did this.It is interesting that the world continues to make and watch movies about this war, even though the greatest generation has all but died out. This is a war we will never forget, even as those who lived it are no longer around to describe it to us. From now on, every generation will tell this story in its own way.",9,9,16,30 July 2017
Dallas Buyers Club," A great story, well told
","Something went very right with this movie. The direction, writing and acting all blended perfectly into a rich and interesting film that expertly shows us a 1985 Dallas we never knew. Vallée tells a good story about the lives of people most of us will never meet. Vallée is clearly a director to keep an eye on.The plot is this: an ordinary Joe (a straight redneck type) gets AIDS, has problems getting properly treated, and stumbles onto alternatives that seem to work better than the drugs being tested on him. Like others, he tries to make money from his discovery by smuggling in some drugs and selling these alternatives outside the pharmaceutical and medical system. He becomes popular. The doctors and FDA get onto his case and do what they can to shut him down. He fights back and becomes a hero.Jared Leto and Matthew McConaughey are astounding. McConaughey's portrayal of Woodruff's desperation and addiction is harrowing. I have to confess to you that I didn't even realize Rayon was being played by Jared Leto until I got home. These fine Oscar-worthy performances rival the ones delivered in American Hustle. When did McConaughey and Leto get so damn good? We used to joke that McConaughey took his shirt off in every movie.There are many details in this tapestry. You'd have to see it several times to catch it all. The filmmaker has a lot of things to say about fate, class, how we deal with illness, the American medical system, medical ethics, sex and relationships, addiction, homophobia, and so on. At times this is a gritty, uncomfortable movie to watch.What I also liked about it is that the dialogue and the various scenes rang true. Woodruff (played by McConaughey) was a great character. A scrappy, difficult lowlife addict who saw an opportunity and had enough wherewithal to take advantage of it. Regardless of whether Woodruff is actually like this, this is the kind of character McConaughey can really sink his teeth into. A redneck rebel loser fighting the system.McConaughey's irascible Woodruff kept the film from becoming too much of a downer or too melodramatic. The movie is not a tearjerker. It's difficult to feel sorry for someone like Woodruff. Nor would he want you to feel that way. It's a good thing that the movie avoided too much melodrama and pathos, because with this subject matter it could easily have gone down that road.This movie is worth about 8.5, but I'm going to round it down for a few reasons.I understand the movie oversells certain points. Was Woodruff actually right, as the movie seems to say? Is AZT that evil? Is Peptide-T that important? Was the FDA as evil as portrayed in the movie? From what I've read, this was not the case. Does anyone today even agree with this movie's point of view about the buyers clubs and AZT? It's a bit too easy to blame the government and big pharma.Also, I'm ashamed to say that my judgmentalism towards drug users, addicts and losers stood in the way of my being able to fully enjoy the film.I found the movie a little slow at one point, and it was a little too serious for my liking.It's timely to have an AIDS movie because too many young people are not wearing condoms.",8,2,2,25 January 2014
Now You See Me," This movie presupposes that people have seen these illusionists on TV
","In this movie about the world of magicians, the illusions presented are suitably spectacular. I felt the movie was slick and modern; something suitable for young Americans who have grown up watching these shows on TV.I think this mildly entertaining movie will have limited appeal to people from countries where programs showing mentalists, illusionists, hypnotists, magicians and so on are not often aired on television. Those of us who have occasionally enjoyed these shows on TV in the the US and UK may be able to understand the American pop cultural background behind this movie. This film takes this entertainment phenomenon and elevates it to a whole new level by presenting it as something more than it actually is. My real problem with the movie was that I did not feel like I was watching true 'mentalism', 'hypnosis', 'illusions' or even 'magic'. With CGI special effects and so on, you can essentially show anything on film nowadays. I was not amazed by any of it, because I assumed it was all just movie magic, not real magic.It also bothered me that most of the illusions would have required hundreds of technicians, builders, etc. to construct and mount. But we're led to believe that these four did it on their own.",6,1,3,5 July 2013
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Best X-Men movie so far
","This is an excellent movie. (Can you tell that I'm sort of surprised?) The science-fiction story, the writing, the pacing, the acting, the franchise exploitation and the CGI effects all come together really well in this latest X-Men film.It helps that three of the finest and most versatile actors on the planet are at the heart of the movie.Hugh Jackman (Wolverine) has done what is necessary to bring an intense physicality and masculine presence to his demanding superhero role. I liked that he was not at the centre of things all the time, although Wolverine was a key player, as in all X-Men movies.James McAvoy (the young Charles Xavier) owns his role and conveys the required emotion so movingly. Such a superb actor. What a stroke of genius it was getting him to play the younger version of Patrick Stewart. For me, he was the emotional heart of the film.The appearance of Michael Fassbender (the young Magneto) on the screen was like a punch to the stomach. Here this versatile actor plays an intense, driven, icy character, and he absolutely nails it. One of the best scenes was one where Magneto confronted the presidential entourage in front of the world's cameras. Mutantus terribilis.The other actors also rose to the challenge. Jennifer Lawrence, in particular. Wow, Raven/Mystique is one female mutant not to mess with. And then, on top of all that, we also had Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen. This struck me as an intelligent and often moving film, despite the endless fight scenes, superhero powers and city-destruction scenes that you see in every movie nowadays. There were a few nuances and profound messages in this film, for those who were looking for them. And the dialogue never seemed off. There were also a few truly hilarious scenes (I'm thinking now of Quicksilver). The writing is good, very good.I was worried because I couldn't quite follow the plot at the start. But it soon sorted itself out. I also thought it was a little anachronistic to have such technology in 1973. But hey it's science fiction, and it didn't ruin the movie for me. Loved the 1973 setting, by the way.Kudos to Bryan Singer, the writers and actors for pulling this off. This is surely the best X-Men movie made so far. It's worth about 8.5. What the heck, I'll give it a 9. Go see it!",9,2,4,22 May 2014
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," The guy with the case full of monsters
","I'm not particularly a Harry Potter fan, but I've seen the Harry Potter films and generally have some familiarity with J.K. Rowling's magic world. This movie is set in the same universe as the Potter movies (albeit a different time and place), so movie goers will be familiar with many of its attributes.This time the story revolves around a curious young British immigrant Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne), who is in 1920s NYC with a bag of fantastic creatures. The story involves a temperance-style anti-witch group, a dark wizard, a no-maj sidekick, two young ladies, and more.Although the visuals were very impressive, and it was all very well done, this busy movie didn't impress me that much. The writing, the plot...not sure what it was. I think perhaps I'm in the wrong demographic to really feel the magic.",7,1,3,29 December 2016
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Not as good as 'Unexpected Journey'
","It's impossible to deny that Jackson's team have produced another fast-paced, action-filled adventure movie that is visually astonishing because of its CGI effects. The scene in the treasure room with the dragon was particularly remarkable. The elf king was an interesting character. I was pleasantly surprised to see Fry in the movie, and I enjoyed his portrayal as the Lord of Lakeland.However, I didn't particularly enjoy this 2nd Hobbit movie. I certainly didn't enjoy it as much as I enjoyed the first one.The orcs were suitably vicious-looking, but it soon became clear that this movie was like a video game where the main point was to kill as many orcs as possible in two minutes. They certainly seem easy to kill.It was just three hours of chasing and noble speeches really. Most of Jackson's movies are like that, although 'Unexpected Journey' transcended it. Let me disclose that, although I am a science fiction fan, I am not into fantasy fiction and LotR. When I was younger, I tried several times to get into LotR, but without success. (I did read 'The Hobbit' in high school because it was mandatory.) I find the LotR universe tedious and overly complicated. I did not really enjoy Jackon's LotR trilogy, although I sat through all three movies. I'd like to see a movie about the real medieval world for a change, rather than one filled with imaginary creatures. I'm tired of dwarfs and orcs.However, unlike many of the reviewers here apparently, I very much enjoyed the first slower-paced more character-driven Hobbit movie. That was a movie that came close to reproducing the slower feel of the Original book. I was hoping this one would be as good as that...but it wasn't.",7,1,6,1 January 2014
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Tour de force
","The Hobbit is considered by many to be the finest work of fantasy ever written. Worldwide, somewhere between 35 and 100 million copies of The Hobbit have been sold since it was published in 1937. This is a book that has sparked the imaginations of many young people and become somewhat of a cultural force.'The Hobbit: The Unexpected Journey' is the first in what is to become a Hobbit trilogy. Even if you don't particularly like the LOTR movies, or enjoy fantasy fiction as a rule, you will enjoy this movie. It's easy to follow, humorous, exciting, curious, and outright beautiful at times.It's absolutely astonishing what filmmakers are able to do now with computer graphics. But this movie is much more than just that. Something is different about this movie. I can't put my finger on it. Is it the character development? The writing? Peter Jackson and his team have developed to the point where they seem to breathe life into the story and its characters. It's nothing less than cinematographic artistry and craftsmanship. The scenes with the Great Goblin and the Gollum in particular were astonishing. I've never seen anything like that on film before. The acting skills of Humphries and Serkis shine through these computer-generated characters.It helps that Tolkien's imagination and writing lay behind it all. To be honest, I was not that impressed by the LOTR movies. This is by far the best Tolkien movie they've made so far. Jackson et al. have done this classic justice.Ten is not an extreme score in the circumstances, but I have a few quibbles about various small things not worth mentioning. All in all, I was thoroughly entertained by this film.",9,3,7,16 February 2013
How to Train Your Dragon 2," My expectations were too high for this frenetic sequel
","I enjoyed HTTYD1, and wrote a good review for it. I had high expectations for this one. Many of the good points of the original movie are found in this one too. There were some surprising moments, and a few moments of animated magic.However, I enjoyed this sequel somewhat less. I was restless throughout the entire film, and I actually had to walk out once. It's hard to put my finger on why. Admittedly, my expectations were quite high.For one thing, this sequel was too busy, too frenetic, too fast moving, too loud, too much shouting. Somehow with this one I was more conscious of the artifice. In HTTYD1, the dragons seemed amazingly real; in this one, they seemed obviously cartoonish.The movie seemed to be about quantity rather than quality. It was the difference between a nature documentary focusing on one small group of animals, and one focusing on a herd. You don't really care about herds.I would have preferred a quieter, more focused film with mystery and magic. There was a little of that here, but this was more like an action-adventure video-game film, with even a nod to recent giant lizard movies like Pacific Rim and Godzilla. There was even shooting and chasing.I just couldn't get into the narrative. It felt convoluted and uninteresting. I groaned audibly when Valka revealed her identity (although I think she was an interesting character, well played by Blanchett). Was I right in thinking that the technology and complexity of this Viking village has increased a lot, more than seems right? In the first move, I felt like it was almost a real Viking village (after I got used to the accents).Perhaps my issues with this sequel are nothing more than the loss of the surprise factor, a problem for any sequel. I'm sorry the filmmakers did not succeed in recapturing the breathtaking originality of the first one. This was an overwrought, overdone development of a good idea rather than a re-creation. A good sequel should be watchable without having seen the original. I don't feel this was the case here.Several things in this movie downright annoyed me, eg the way Hiccup kept asking 'what's going on' and kept calling Toothless 'bud'. I suppose that's the writing; however, I also think Baruchel was miscast. I get it: whiny, insecure, smart-alecky kid tames nightfury and becomes hero and then grows up and becomes smart chieftain. I couldn't get past the whiny smart aleck.Maybe I have to see this movie again to appreciate it properly. It's worth about 6.5 in my books.",7,2,6,23 June 2014
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Flight of fancy
","This unusual movie is a comedy set in a German-speaking country similar to Austria in the 1930s. The movie starts with beautiful Alpine scenery, a grand hotel with eccentric wealthy guests, formal old Europe manners and culture, and highly articulate dialogue (often delivered deadpan). The story is about the best concierge in the history of 'The Grand Budapest Hotel', the ultra-suave, loquacious, dandyish, mysterious M. Gustave, and the series of adventures that led to his fortune and eventually his demise.The plot in a nutshell: after he inherits a priceless painting from a rich, elderly woman smitten with his, ahem, concierge services, M. Gustave battles to escape the wrath of the family, who accuse him of murdering her and try to get the painting back. This plot summary fails to mention various diversions, including the lobby boy, Mendl's pastries, the monastery, the toboggan chase, and the fascist forces closing in. It's not a natural or realistic film, but a highly stylised and richly detailed story within a story within a story. The film has a light-hearted, fast-paced, slapstick, madcap feel. I lack sufficient knowledge to identify properly the style of the film: cartoonish, camp and over the top are phrases that come to mind, but these words are too pejorative. Let's just call it a comedy of manners, a flight of fancy, stylised story-telling. When interesting stories are told, and retold, they become reimagined artificial reflections of what actually happened. Similarly, as listen to a story, we fashion in our mind's eye the visual details that bring the story to life. This movie is like that. It's not meant to be realistic. It's meant to appeal to a child-like fantasy view of 1930s Mittel-Europa. It reminded me of 'Hugo' in that sense.This movie didn't really engage me or move me. It was more of an intellectual experience. After leaving the theatre, we were unable to identify what the point of the movie was. I suppose it was a character study of the remarkable M. Gustave (superbly played by Fiennes) but since the character was so implausible, the point rather escaped us. There has never been and never will be a concierge like M. Gustave. I suppose the point of the film was just to be entertaining and amusing and appealing to the eye (like the Mindl pastries, M. Gustave and the Grand Budapest Hotel). If so, the film succeeded.",8,0,5,27 April 2014
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Not as good as the first one
","This version of the Jurassic Park franchise had good CGI special effects. The dinosaurs were spectacular, and that is what we all flocked to these movies to see. As expected, there were several elaborate nail-biting scenes with characters in extremis because of the various carnivorous and vicious dinos. At times, the jungle scenes were even beautiful and evocative (I'm thinking now of the tiny dinosaurs scampering through the sun-lit riverbed).I enjoyed the first movie much more. This sequel lacked the magical quality of the first blockbuster. This sequel emphasised more how dangerous the dinosaurs are. 'Don't f*ck with mother nature because mother nature will f*ck with you.' In a way, the JP series evokes 19th c. notions of humanity's dominion over the earth, especially once the T-Rex starts roaring. In a movie like this, we revert to hunter-gatherers huddled around our safe fires while the megafauna roam dangerously about. 'Kill the evil dinosaurs!' However, the exposition at the start was too long and most of the dialogue was not well written. There were various plot developments that seemed contrived or didn't seem right for other reasons. (For example, the ship ending exactly at the appointed spot despite having no crew.) Annoyingly, characters did obviously stupid things in various scenes (eg walk off from the group for some distance just to take a wee). The writers tried to make environmentalism a theme here, but this crashed and burned once the T-Rexes and velociraptors started doing their thing. The end game in San Diego should have gone into a separate movie.The acting by Goldblum and Moore was fine. They each have their own distinctive styles, which they brought to their parts. But to be honest of these actors are too good for a movie like this. Goldblum was stuck in his 'nature will find a way' mode; Moore was his 'let me pet the baby dino' foil. Moore was 37 when this was shot, but looks younger. Goldblum was significantly older. I didn't really see the two of them together, so their arguing scenes felt off to me. Kelly's character (the black daughter) didn't work for me at all.These two Jurassic Park movies were released in the mid-1990s, when America was the sole-standing superpower reaping the benefit of winning the Cold War, 9/11 hadn't happened yet, and the financial troubles to come were barely even on the horizon. American was on a high, and everyone was raking it in. Those were the days! Our troubles were confined, although if this movie is to be believed they had already been loose and were ready to destroy San Diego. I suppose we have this movie and its predecessor to thank for the endless parade of giant lizard monsters that we have to endure in the cinema nowadays (Pacific Rim, Godzilla, the new Transformers, and so on).I would give this movie an 8.5 on the basis of the CGI effects; however, the rest of it drags it down to a 6.5 or so. In the end, my gut feeling is to round that down to 6.",6,0,2,4 June 2014
Behind The Candelabra," People see what they want to see
","Gosh, what a entertaining movie this is. It's worth more than its current IMDb rating.Moviegoers are treated to interesting revelations about an episode in the life of a strange celebrity, told from the point of view of the young man involved. It shows us some of Liberace's musical talent, his real life, his inner sanctum and his extraordinary world. The plot is simple and age old: man meets boy, man gets boy, man ruins boy, man throws damaged boy away. (If Liberace could see this movie, he'd be spinning in his grave.) This movie was made by an A-list director at the peak of his career. Two superb lead actors and a number of other outstanding supporting actors deliver truly astonishing performances. I would be shocked if these actors were not awarded.In addition to the juicy biographical details about Liberace and his sordid dalliances with boys four decades younger than him, this movie has important things to say about Hollywood, American celebrity culture, extreme wealth, certain aspects of gay life and gay relationships (well, some anyway), and indeed relationships in general.I haven't read Thorson's book, but this movie felt honest to me. Yes, this movie is about a 'rich old closet queen' and a 'hustler', but the film forces us to see how meaningless these labels are. (I suppose this was cinematically done long ago for their straight equivalent roles.) I can't think of another movie that focused on the sexual aspects of a gay relationship (albeit a very dysfunctional one) as much as this one did. I'm glad Soderbergh gave the role to the droolworthy Damon, who most certainly nailed it. This movie would have been a lot more uncomfortable to watch if a real 17-year-old had played Thorson. In this film, the absurd relationship between Liberace and Thorson is made believable and not so absurd.The movie did not blow me away, nor did it impress me sufficiently to give it a higher score than 8.5 or so -- but I'm not sure why. I was not particularly moved by the film, and some aspects could have been explained a little more fully.",8,1,3,10 August 2013
Gone Girl," What have we done to each other?
","In this modern psychological thriller, Director David Fincher and writer Gillian Flynn explore the themes of relationships gone wrong, obsession, madness and murder.Our hero in this movie is Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck). He's married to Amy (Rosamund Pike), a woman with celebrity and money. They have a story-book marriage and a great life together in small-town Missouri. However, one morning Nick comes home to find that his wife is missing. The search and police investigation begin. Because of her celebrity, Nick soon finds himself at the centre of a true American media circus. It quickly emerges that Nick is not a hero after all and their marriage has been far from perfect.Where is his wife? Is she still alive? Everyone thinks she's dead, and Nick is the main suspect. The movie then takes no less than three sharp turns, with a dark surprise ending that no one could expect. This movie was layered, with the director and writer skillfully revealing the next layer at just the right moment. The writing and direction are excellent. This movie is not just intelligent, it's amusingly witty.This is a rich movie, with lots of detail about American life. 'Perfect' couples, suburban life and the criminal justice system are expertly dissected. The phenomenon of trial-by-media in the US receives special excoriation. (Is it a trend now for American movies to be so critical of the excesses of their culture?) The acting is superb, from everyone involved. It's difficult to single anyone out, because they were all very good. All of the actors could be praised. Ben Affleck — surely recognised by all now as a peerless A-list actor and director — has found another role that showcases his masculine presence and acting skills.At two-and-a-half hours, this movie felt a little long. I looked at my watch a few times. However, the end was worth waiting for. Not to be missed. It's worth 8.5. I'll give it 8 for now but maybe raise that to 9 after seeing it again.",8,0,3,9 January 2015
Django Unchained," Original and fun
","I enjoyed this movie, although I don't really know why.It is ridiculously violent, downright cheesy, corny and melodramatic, rather artificial and unrealistic, occasionally aimless, overly complicated.However, it is quite original and certainly fun to watch. Tarantino delights in showing moviegoers bold, shocking characters and images . Many of them are cliché but at the same time they are strangely original and seductive, and not cliché at all. Vampire aliens and Nazis have served as the villains in his past movies; now it is the turn of slave owners and traders, and their redneck yahoo workers.In the 'horrors of slavery', Tarantino has found a juicy historical scab to pick, and he works at it for over two and a half hours. He shows us things about the South that probably never happened, but that we think must have happened. This movie made me wonder why we don't see more movies about what slavery was really like (not just in the South, but everywhere).Some of the characters are memorable and the performances truly excellent: Christoph Waltz and Samuel Jackson in particular have created astonishing, powerfully evocative characters that will be hard to forget. Glorious bastards.However, the scene with Tarantino and the men with Australian accents didn't work for me at all. It was like the movie had stopped and we were now watching a skit or rehearsal.And go see this movie if you're ready to go through the psychological experiment of seeing what happens to your understanding of the N-word after you hear it repeated 5,000 times (in 160 minutes). It's a strange thing that the Dutch film distributors chose to allow the N-word to be translated as 'neger' in the Dutch subtitles, which is roughly the equivalent of 'negro'. For English speakers, imagine if 'negro' had been used 5,000 times in this movie instead of 'n*gger'. No, I think the right Dutch translation would have been 'nikker'. They chose to bowdlerize the translation.",8,2,6,8 March 2013
Frozen," The cold never bothered me anyway
","This latest Disney movie is a rather fun experience filled with beautiful animation and catchy tunes. Based on an imaginative new story, the film is directly aimed at young girls (and women who are young at heart), and has some surprisingly profound and sophisticated messages about emotions and relationships. That's not to say that young boys (and old coots who are not particularly young at heart) cannot enjoy the movie as well. I felt the movie really soared with the 'Let It Go' number. This is when I sat up and thought, 'what the hell?' It's difficult to dismiss or belittle Disney when it is able to present magical scenes like this on the screen. 'Fixer Upper' and the love scene at the end were also uplifting.Else was in many ways the central character in the movie. I loved the fact that Disney resisted the temptation to make her an evil character, but rather turned her into the much more interesting persona that she is. After seeing it twice, I feel it's worth about 7.5, but I'm willing to round my score up to 8. One problem with this movie is that it is the chickest of chick flicks.",8,1,2,8 January 2014
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," It's just OK
","This is an OK film, I suppose, but it didn't move me at all, and I found it no more than somewhat entertaining. Given the theme and message, this is a movie I should have loved.It's hard for me to identify what the problem was exactly. Part of it, perhaps, is that the dreamed adventure sequences were too powerful; the real adventure sequences too unrealistic. Much of it felt too artificial, too movie-ish. The evilness of the bearded guy was too cartoonish. The subplot about the missing picture was not right. The extended e-Harmony subplot didn't feel right either. We don't really get much insight into Mitty's thinking at the point when he decides to fly to Greenland. The suddenness of his transformation felt too sudden.I'm sorry, but you can't just fly to another country and start doing these amazing physical things, especially if you don't train. I mean he skateboards 16 km downhill and is barely breathing hard by the time he's finished. He jumps into freezing cold water and fights off a shark, but doesn't require medical attention afterwards. In real life he'd be in severe shock after that. Later he outdrives a pyroclastic flow, which is quite impossible. Climbing a mountain in the Himalayas just like that is not something you can do either. Anyway, I think you get the picture. It's worth about 6/10, but I'm going to bump it up because I believe in the idea of life transformation. There are many Walter Mittys in the world. Get offline and get out there.",7,3,7,31 December 2013
The Incredibles," Funny, smart, entertaining animation film
","Superheroes are no longer valued in America, so they have to hang up their capes and live their lives full time in their secret identities. Elastigirl and Mr Incredible have got married, are settled down and have super-powered kids. However, this suppressed life is very difficult for all of them. Mr Incredible has a horrible job, a horrible car and has got fat -- the American nightmare.Fortunately, Mr Incredible is brought back into action. He and his family end up in an evil villain's jungle island lair. The rich evil villain (Syndrome) has a personal grudge against Mr Incredible, has been eliminating former superheroes and is developing a city-crusher weapon. Will this super family same themselves and the city? Thirteen years after being released, this intelligent, fast-paced animated family film is still quite entertaining for young and old. What I liked in particular about it was the writing and the rich detail in the story. There is a clever reworking of many old, tired themes. This movie was a vibrant remix of Bond movie, domestic sitcom and superhero saga. It all felt creative and fresh. At times it exploded into comedic brilliance (eg Edna Mode; Frozone's wife). The animation is superb, clearly the work of professionals at the top of their field.Well done to everyone involved. I feel it's worth about 8.5.",8,0,0,5 July 2017
I Am Legend," Going mad in an empty New York
","I thought this was a decent science-fiction movie for two reasons in particular. First, Will Smith delivers a great performance. What would happen to someone who had survived the horror of an apocalypse and was left alone for three years? Smith gives us a good idea.Second, the post-apocalyptic scenes of an empty New York were particularly interesting. (Since 2007, however, the History channel has broadcast their series on 'Life After People' so this no longer comes across as a novel movie concept.) I admire the producers for avoiding a cliché ending, but still....it wasn't satisfying.Despite the appropriation of the name, this movie departs significantly from the Richard Matheson novel. If you prefer movies that are faithful to the book, don't see this one. The earlier movies on the same theme had faded from memory, so I saw it as a fresh concept. I was actually surprised at the direction this movie took.It's interesting to me that this popular movie, released about five years ago, has practically the same score on IMDb.com and RottenTomatoes.com.The IMDb user score is currently 71%. The audience rating on RT is 69%, but the average is 72%. Not that different.IMDb's 'metascore' (which is based on 37 critic reviews provided by Metacritic.com) assigns it a score of 65%. On RT the 'Tomatometer' is at 70%, although the 'average score' is 64%. These scores are based on published movie reviews. Again, not that different.The statistics on both these sites are based on a huge number of user ratings and dozens of movie reviews.There are only 8 points between the lowest and highest score. Should I be surprised that these scores are so uniform five years after the movie was first released? The popular scores (around 69%) are a little better than the reviewer scores. But not by much. There doesn't seem to be much difference. I wonder whether this is common.Movie goers often go for high and low scores when they rate movies: they give it a 10 if they love it; 0 if not. I wonder how much this voting dynamic affects the final scores? Perhaps in the end this is what makes user scores different from movie review scores.And why do I feel that my score should be higher than the one that has emerged after five years out of hundreds of thousands of ratings? I suppose it's because I love science fiction. I am also forgiving of plot holes, science problems and lack of realism. As long as a movie is entertaining, has a few neat concepts and a character worth caring about, I'm willing to forgive almost anything.",8,0,0,1 June 2012
The Bourne Legacy," Another Bourne-like movie
","Aaron Cross (played by Jeremy Renner) is a Jason Bourne-like super spy who gets caught up in the middle of the agency's violent and unexpected elimination of his programme. His programme (Outcome) is associated with the Treadstone programme (which, as we know from the last Bourne movie, is finished). Yes, he's survived, but his main concern is to retrieve more chems so that he can maintain his enhanced condition. No programme, no chems. So he finds Dr Marta Shearing (played by Rachel Weisz) to assist him with this. Will they succeed? This film is enjoyable enough. It's similar to the other movies in this genre.To me Jeremy Renner is an exciting actor. He specialises in tough. However, there is something about him that makes it difficult for me to empathise with him. A lack of vulnerability or something. Rachel Weisz remains the awesome actress I fell in love with when she played Hypatia in Agora. (Now there is a movie...)My main problem is with the genre. We don't get spies and spy agencies anymore. Every spy is a super spy. Every agency is armed to the teeth with mind-blowing technology. The Bourne movies, the new Bond movies, Safe House and so on -- they're all like this now.I suppose I've reached the point where I no longer enjoy movies that are based primarily on shootouts and chases, technology and superheroes.In the movies in this new genre the security agency involved has incredible technology allowing them to visually track pretty well anything in the world. They can find any information they need in seconds. They have instant access to data bases you didn't even know existed. They can do anything really. Instantly accessible CCTV, the internet, facial recognition software, and telephone tapping all play a huge role in these movies. These agencies now have miraculous, almost godlike powers.There are always flunkies sitting at screens and then an intense man or hard-nosed woman standing around shouting orders at everyone. Put me though to Langley! (In this movie this role is played by Ed Norton.)These agencies seem to have endless cash and will not hesitate for a second to do anything. Fly a team to Zurich! Deploy the jets to Zambia! Send out the drones!To buy into these movies, you have to believe governments are routinely bamboozling the media and the politicians and spending hordes of cash on secret programmes. It's all a little too paranoid for me.Moreover, in these movies the agents often have superhuman intellectual and physical abilities, far beyond that of trained athletes and martial arts experts. They jump from roof to roof, get injured in the knee, smash their heads against doors -- and yet press on. They all fight like Bruce Lee, although you never see them spending hours in training. They can fly airplanes, drive like stunt men, do daredevil tricks with motorcycles. They have superb memories, training in explosives and computers, and knowledge on how to disarm nuclear weapons. These people are not only highly trained, super fit, super smart sharpshooters trained in martial arts and computers to an unearthly level, but they're also sort of invulnerable. They're superheros really. (In this movie, at least they try to explain it.)And of course there's always a rogue element: it's always the case that someone has become, will become, or is suspected of being, not what he seems. The viewer is invited in virtually every film to try to figure out the twist. In a spy agency you can't trust anyone, can you. It's almost a rule now. Nothing is as it seems. Usually someone is on the run.These films are a combination of the 'Spy' and 'Superhero' or 'Martial Arts' genre, but with 'Science Fiction' technology thrown in. And the rogue element has some of the 'Mystery' genre in it. Also, in these American films there are almost always intense shoot outs and chase scenes. Everything happens very fast. Lots of crazy driving, crashes and near death escapes. That makes them 'Action' films. And of course they're shot in 'Exotic Locations'.I know it's corny but I refer to these movies as 'MASSFLAMES' movies (based on the acronyms for the genres listed above.)All these movies seem the same to me, including this one. However, it's pretty good and if you like this kind of film I'm sure you'll love this one.",7,7,12,27 August 2012
22 Jump Street," Puerile, unfunny nonsense
","I'm afraid I have to trash this movie. I hated it. I'm angry at myself for sitting through the whole thing even though I realised after two minutes that I hated it.The only scene I truly enjoyed was the fight scene between Jillian Bell and Jonah Hill. In my books, Bell was the only truly funny person in this movie.I found the bromance relationships between Schmidt and Jenko, and then between Jenko and Zook, to be forced and unrealistic. In the end the making fun of homoeroticism made me uncomfortable. Look, it's like they're gay! Why is that so funny? It's not. The bantering between them was ridiculous.The relationship between Maya and Schmidt was absurd. The Captain Dickson character didn't work for me at all. I wanted him to stop. I couldn't figure out what that police complex was about. Why was Jenko like some Terminator Spiderman guy? I don't know. So many questions.This is yet another American movie to portray college life like some orgiastic drink-and-drug fest. It's not like that. The students in this movie were too old to be playing their parts. The jokes about Schmidt and Jenko being too old fell flat because of it.It's derisory that this movie currently gets 8 on IMDb.com. It's worth about a 4. I'd bump it up to 5 to acknowledge the scenes with Bell, but then when I think about wasting two hours watching this movie it makes me angry, so I'm lowering that back down to 4. Maybe you have to see the first movie to get this one, but I definitely won't see it now.",4,14,37,25 June 2014
Meet Joe Black," It goes by in a blink
","The two main characters in this movie are Death and Bill Parish (Anthony Hopkins). The conceit is that death takes human form for a while to experience human existence in various ways, blackmailing urbane, rich, successful Bill to be his guide. Death takes a holiday. The Angel of Death, the Grim Reaper, in this movie isBrad Pitt. Of course, Joe and Bill's daughter fall for each other.This meaningful movie has a number of profound themes. The main theme is the acceptance of death — not a light subject for a feel-good Hollywood movie, but it works well enough. A second theme is Bill's simple message to live life to its fullest, with no regrets, because your years 'go by in a blink'. (Isn't that true!) Another extended theme is the father-daughter bond.I found this to be a melancholic and slow movie. I was willing to go along with the 'Death walks among us' conceit, but Bill was a little too quick to accept Joe for who he was. The heart attack scenes didn't impress it on me enough.Hopkins, Forlani, Harden and Tambor were quite good. Pitt was strongest in the scenes with the Jamaican woman. I didn't really enjoy Brad Pitt in this film, although he played his role well enough for it not to ruin the film for me. I'm not sure whether it was him or the lines given to his character. The Pinocchio-becomes-a-real-boy idea has been done before, and that's essentially what this was.It is clever to see death as a looming, almost-human presence that accompanies us as we get fatally ill or very old; however, if death were to become Death, I don't think it would be like this.Interestingly, 15 years after its release, the film is being shown on Valentine's Day and billed as a sort of archetypal love story. I suppose it is a grand love story, but I found it hard to get a handle on that aspect. I kept looking for a meaning of some kind in the love story, eg infatuation as a form of suicide; le grand mort découvert le petit mort, that sort of thing. This film falls into the categories of (effective) tear-jerker and chick flick (complete with a shot of Pitt's abs), but at times it became a little too silly and unrealistic for me.I'd see this movie unless chick flicks, slow-paced films, long films, and tearjerkers are absolutely not your thing. Like it or not, we all struggle with death. I'd like to see more films that help us to understand death (rather than just showing it)",7,0,1,14 February 2014
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," I walked out
","I admit that I haven't been keeping up to date with this franchise (having not even seen the last three Spidey movies). I went to see this one because when I went to the theatre it was the next movie playing.I didn't enjoy this movie. I fell asleep for a few minutes at the start, and I walked out after about 70 minutes, something I rarely do.However, I did enjoy the 3D CGI scenes of Spidey travelling through NYC.I was surprised to see that Spider-Man is more like Superman now, in terms of his strength. (But you see this creeping inflation in superhero powers in most comic-based action movies now.) Garfield is not a young actor who interests or excites me. I don't really see him as Spider-Man. I did give it a shot, for an hour or so.I really didn't like the wisecracking of this Spider-Man. The cheesiness of this caught me off guard. I didn't like the dialogue, which was more like repartee actually. The movie collapsed several times into boring melodrama that reminded me of soap opera or Glee. The scene in which Peter breaks up with Gwen seemed forced and cliché. The scene between Peter and Aunt May seemed off and unrealistic. The Jamie Foxx character was unappealing. His treatment by his coworkers was cartoonishly portrayed. (I've been wondering lately whether the Hollywood people who make movies have ever really been employed. They don't seem to know what employment is actually like.)This movie felt too movieish, too full of itself. It didn't seem original. After a while, I became aware of the problem that the scenes were disjointed, and I wasn't interested enough to thread it together.I didn't like the music.After a while I put on my jacket and left. I'm surprised by the current score, but I suppose the legions out there have spoken and we must all bear the consequences.I'm sorry to the people involved for such a negative review. I see from the demographics of the scoring that people under 18 are rating this movie the highest. This seems about right. It's absolutely absurd (and an indictment of internet rating systems) that about 20% of viewers give this movie 10/10. This is a phenomenon that I don't understand, and that I suspect has little or nothing to do with the movie itself. I want to give it 1/10 (because after all I wasted my money), but that seems irresponsible. I'll give it a 4.",4,17,39,30 April 2014
Lincoln," Intelligent, classic, moving
","Around 150 years ago, 600,000 Americans died in a bloody civil war that was essentially fought over the issue of whether to abolish slavery. It almost tore the United States apart. The man who kept it together was Abraham Lincoln.This is an important and intelligent historical-political drama about Lincoln's efforts to free American slaves. Even in the free North, it didn't happen after a single glorious speech. It was a determined, rancorous, highly political and sometimes nasty effort to get two thirds of the US Congress to vote in favour of the 13th amendment. The vote could easily have been lost.If you like historical dramas based on true events, you'll enjoy this movie. It certainly felt historically accurate. Spielberg has succeeded in bringing Lincoln, and city of Washington DC during the Civil-War years, to life.I cannot really explain it, but at times I was deeply moved while watching this film.I am not particularly a Daniel Day Lewis fan, but his performance in this movie was astonishing and most certainly Oscar-worthy. Sally Fields shows us exactly what Mrs Lincoln must have been like. The casting and acting of all the actors was superb. Not a false note anywhere.Even though this is a Hollywood blockbuster, it is not a sensational action film. It is a discourse-oriented and rather didactic movie that presumes a certain understanding of American history. The dialogue and events were a little difficult to follow at times, even with subtitles. At the screening I was at, some people were apparently unable to handle it, and walked out.Spielberg remains a movie-maker of the highest order. In making a movie that came into existence as a classic, he demonstrates most convincingly that he has not lost his touch. He has shown the world why Americans consider Lincoln to be a great man, despite the horrors of the Civil War.",9,0,1,16 February 2013

The Imitation Game," 'I cannot judge you'
","This movie is a gem, a masterpiece. It is so rich in narrative, character development and historical detail. This film had me enthralled, and by the end in tears and shaking with anger. I weep too much in movies, it's true, but this one cuts straight to the heart. A modern tragedy. A few years ago Alan Turing was honoured at Manchester Pride, and it moves me deeply now to think about it. Too late to help him, even if he hadn't committed suicide. Kudos to the British government for trying at least to undo some of the damage and right a terrible wrong. We need more movies like this. People don't understand. How many millions of human beings have been crushed by ignorance. Such a waste! So much shame, frustration and suffering. Even now many of us still live in dysfunction, especially in the Third World, and don't lead the full lives we were meant to lead.This movie's message and impact are profound. Thank you Morten Tyldum, Andrew Hodges, Graham Moore and Benedict Cumberbatch. I suppose I should point out that this is another movie that could be called a gay tragedy. Yes, there are too many of those. However, this a story begging to be told.I can only leave a short review now, but I'll say more after I've seen the movie again.",9,1,4,8 March 2015
Jurassic World," Formula works once again
","I've enjoyed all the Jurassic Park movies. The makers of this movie have applied the formula competently; the actors all do their jobs; and the CGI is suitably real looking -- so the movie works reasonably well. It was particularly interesting to jump ahead a generation to see how the 'park' developed into a 'world'. Forgive me...but isn't this idea of 'Jurassic World' really sad? The disneyfication of a natural wonder: yuck to that. I suppose this reflects what's really happening though. Art copies life copies art. We flock to the movie just like the crowds flock to the dinosaur island. I suppose the hope is that the money-generating theme parks in Florida will get another generation of eager visitors.The wonder of this franchise is definitely gone for me. Whatever happened to the genuine wonder we all felt about dinosaurs? Is it right for these people to capitalise on that? And then exploit it in film after bloated film?There just wasn't anything that new and exciting about this movie. OK, except for Chris Pratt. Stroke of genius casting him and developing the character to suit his personality. He singlehandedly raises this movie from a 7 to an 8. He is the new Harrison Ford, except even easier on the eyes.",8,3,14,6 August 2015
Logan," Charles and Logan go on a roadtrip
","This is another movie in Marvel's X-Men franchise. We're a few decades in the future of the other movies. Logan (Wolverine) and Charles (Professor X) are old, isolated and not doing well. The entire mutant thing has been successfully stopped, and the mutants are being hunted (by men called 'Reavers' for some reason). There is also a mad scientist experimenting with mutants. Logan and Charles get together and try to save Laura, a mutant with the same powers as Logan. She's got Logan's DNA so they think of her as his daughter. Logan is not really into it. She keeps talking about a mutant hideout near the Canadian border. Logan thinks it's hogwash, but he takes her there, chased the whole time by the hunters and mad scientist. Will Logan lead them to safety in Canada (his homeland, as we all remember).I heard this was a really good film, but to me it was just OK. I'm not sure what the hype was about. I guess this superhero film is different from the rest because it reflects on the idea of the decline and death of superheros. I'm not sure it's something I need to explore, since I'm not really into this genre in the first place. There's nothing about this movie that stood out for me. I'm not really into the characters. Hugh Jackman played his role with the usual gusto, but I didn't see anything in the character to draw me to it. I don't understand why the Wolverine character has had so many movies. Boyd Holbrook was interesting. It's not a bad film, although I thought it was too violent, and it bothered me how the innocent people they came across were all wiped out.So, this movie's current score on IMDb is 8.7? And it's the 37th top rated movie? Wait...37th of all time? OK, this is an OK film, but it's not that good. This just indicates how many young men are into these superhero movies and will go online to support them. It's a shame because it skews the entire IMDb movie rating system.",7,1,4,7 March 2017
Elysium," Adventure in a dystopic future
","What will happen to the Earth if we are unable or unwilling to stop environmental mismanagement, overpopulation, massive illegal immigration, and the erosion of the middle class? Things would just get worse and worse until, in about 150 years or so, we would have a seriously contaminated, overpopulated and borderless planet. Society would be divided into the very poor and the very rich, and the poor would live in vast urban slums. Imagine a Los Angeles that looks like the slums of Jakarta or Cairo. It's not so unimaginable.But of course the very rich would escape. They would use their billions and their advanced technology to create the ultimate gated community, perhaps even a massive space station from which they could continue to run their exploitative enterprises, and yet live in comfort away from the squalor. They would develop the medical technology to cure any illness and prolong life, but this could not be shared with the teeming masses. (In America at least.) Neill Blomkamp (District 9) shows us this dystopic future in 'Elysium', a science-fiction action film. The story revolves around a lowly worker (played by Matt Damon) who, after suffering an deadly accident, stumbles across a way of changing his situation -- and the world's. He's a tough and determined ex-con with a good heart. Will he succeed? I enjoyed this highly visual movie, although its bleak portrayal of the future was at times a little depressing and frustrating. Blomkamp, a promising young filmmaker, has succeeded admirably in bringing his grand vision to the screen. The special effects are excellent.At times I found the film unexpectedly moving.Some of the basic premises underlying the vision seemed not to have been properly thought out (or at least are not explained in the movie). I kept asking myself questions. Also, some of the characters were over the top. I'm not sure what was wrong here, but the writing may have been a little weak.Viewers who are quick to suspend disbelief will enjoy this movie the most. Science fiction fans and future technology junkies will enjoy it immensely. Judging by the reviews here on IMDb, if you're a right-wing American actively fighting in the culture wars, you won't enjoy this film. So save yourself the heartache, and save us the post-movie rant: don't go.",8,1,2,18 August 2013
Avatar," Pandora
","I'm not wont to assign a perfect score to a film, but this is one that deserves it. I've seen it four times now, and it remains a brilliant jewel of a movie. How often does a film reduce a cynical, angry adult man to a state of childlike wonder? There is nothing to criticize in this film. It is pure entertainment, a work of art. It is interesting, intelligent, fast-paced, action-filled, beautiful and enchanting. The story itself is simple: a soldier goes native and saves the locals and their world from destruction from his own kind. This story has been told before (surely); however, it has never been told like this. However, the crucial fact is that the story is set in Pandora, the ultimate alien jungle paradise. Yes, this movie is all about Pandora. Thís planet and its denizens the Na'vi are portrayed in the film with astonishing technical skill, more like technical artistry. On top of all this, the movie has a profound message about, well, mystical environmentalism. Is that completely cool or what? Really, this is perhaps the best film ever made. Cameron is a god.",10,3,5,29 April 2015
The Artist," Soporific
","I wanted to like this movie. I really did. I suppose I was tired or not in the right mood. I just couldn't stay awake. I drifted in and out of sleep during the middle hour. The lack of dialogue, the samey music, the lack of colour, the uninteresting theme, the slow story -- it just didn't spark any interest in me. Yes, I know there was sound at one point. I missed that part, unfortunately.This happened to me once before, with a movie called 'A Fish Called Wanda'. Everyone thought it was a great movie, but I just didn't get it. That's essentially what happened here.I was impressed by the technical expertise in recreating the Hollywood of that era and what seemed like an authentic silent film. I liked the dog, I suppose. The main character, played by Dujardin, was unexpectedly attractive.But that wasn't enough I'm afraid. Sorry. I'd like to give it a higher score, but how can I rate highly a film that had such a soporific effect on me? I promise to go a second time and give it another chance, this time when I'm wide awake and ready to appreciate its more nuanced artistry.",5,2,6,23 April 2012
La La Land," Sorta slow. Didn't feel the magic.
","It's very strange to me that I thought Passengers was quite good and La La Land rather slow and boring. The critics saw it the other way around. Disconcertingly, I just don't agree with what the glowing reviews are saying about this movie. I was checking my phone throughout. I didn't see the magic here. This film didn't blow me away, despite what the critics were promising. I didn't get it.I won't say that I wasn't moved, because it was moving near the end, and that's always a sign of a good film. I particularly liked the song about the aunt jumping in the Seine. More of this please. However, the people I was with didn't even appreciate this scene. They thought the whole show was a waste of money.I can see Hollywood as a metaphor for 'following your dreams'. The theme of 'follow your dreams wherever they may lead you' is a noble one. I loved 'LA Story', including the surrealist bits but maybe that's because of the character development. I'm into movies, but I'm not particularly into Hollywood. I hated 'The Artist'. The singing and dancing just weren't that great. The surrealism and overt Hollywoodness here felt cheesy and excessive to me. Did it go too far maybe? Perhaps I wanted more psychological insight, more realistic character development, and less Fred and Ginger. This movie was a little too artsy and contrived for me.Still, I might see it again, just to try to see what all the critics are seeing.",7,8,14,27 December 2016
Super 8," What if ET were a huge predatory alien?
","This is a competently made film and a fun cross between Americana and sci-fi.It has Spielberg written all over it. The movie succeeds at portraying young teenagers caught up in fantastic events. This a film with a fast pace and plenty of action. Loved the train wreck scene in particular. Wow.A group of boys in their early teens are making a super 8 movie in a typical Ohio town. An older girl (Jen) is acting for them. Joe likes Jen, but there is a secret: Joe's dad is a deputy too busy for his son and Jen's father is a wreck and the reason Joe's mom is dead.During one of their shoots, they witness a truck purposefully crashing into a speeding train, derailing and destroying it. The man in the truck (miraculously surviving this) turns out to be someone they know, and he warns them to run and never talk to anyone about it.After the derailment, the military takes over. There was something mysterious on the train. Afterwards, strange events befall the town. Dogs and people disappear. There is a large terrifying creature loose. The military evacuates the town and tries unsuccessfully to kill it. The boys get caught up in the military operation when they do some investigating to see what is going on. They find out that the alien has taken Jen, so they track it down to its lair and rescue her.(spoiler) It turns out the alien was trying to use alien technology to construct a space ship to take it home. It succeeds. In particular, I loved the dialogue and acting of the teenage boys here. Character development and capturing small-town Ohio in 1979 is a big part of the movie. It's very watchable, with plenty of thrills and touching moments.Joel Courtney pulls it off as the young expressive lead. Riley Griffiths (now an enormous college football player) is great as the overweight young moviemaker. AJ Michalka plays Jen really well. The director succeeds in eliciting great performances here. Kyle Chandler and Ron Eldard (two of my favourites) are great as the dads.A few false tones... The military is evil here -- once again. Also, why the magical moment as the alien takes off. We are supposed to conveniently forget the many it has killed. I guess the idea is that the alien just needed to survive. Worth about 7.5, but I'm going to round it up. I've enjoyed it the three times I've seen it.",8,0,1,24 August 2015
Snowden," The Snowden story, well told
","Oliver Stone is such a great director. He's succeeded once again in producing an interesting and sympathetic historical movie, this time about the Edward Snowden whistle-blowing story. His movies are so credible, so finely crafted, so watchable.It is a pleasure to just sit back and let Stone show Snowden's story to you. I can't imagine anyone ever producing a Snowden movie that is better than this one. I felt the story was presented objectively and neutrally. Only near the end did the political aspect become a little too much. Yes, Stone is taking a pro-Snowden position and is trying to convince you that his position is right. If you are unable to emotionally handle that didactic aspect, don't see this movie.Can I also talk about Joseph Gordon-Levitt? The man is clearly a great actor with enormous range. He's been in dozens of movies now, and his performances in each of them have been excellent. He really does capture Snowden in this movie. Kudos to him, Stone and everyone else involved in this film.",8,16,20,15 January 2017
Woman in Gold," Viennese memories
","Some movie goers resent having their heart strings tugged. I suppose it feels manipulative to them.However, I am not one of them. To me, catharsis is one reason I go to the movies. Weeping, laughing, experiencing wonder, getting thrilled or frightened, and, yes, getting a little turned on are other good reasons to go to the movies. If any of these things occur in the context of a good story, I feel I got many money's worth. I also go for intellectual stimulation and to learn, of course.Well, this movie had me teary-eyed for most of it. It wasn't so much the acting of Helen Mirren (although that was good, especially when the full emotional force of it came crashing down on Maria). It was also the flashbacks to Maria's happy childhood and the horrors of her persecution and flight. This movie personalized the holocaust, and turned it into an interesting and moving story that still feels true and relevant. This is not a story about the cattle cars and ovens, but about a painting that came to represent a sophisticated woman's memories of Vienna and her family, and what happened to them. This is a poignant movie about memory and growing old.In hindsight, I can identify a few issues, especially the black-and-white simplicity of it all. I think more could have been done in the portrayal of magnificent Vienna. However, that didn't ruin the movie for me.I'm sorry but stories like this cannot be told enough.",9,1,2,11 June 2015
How to Train Your Dragon," Beautiful, colourful, imaginative, evocative, engaging and heartwarming
","After seeing this film three times now (twice in 3D on the silver screen and once on the idiot box), I'm of the opinion that it is a near-perfect masterpiece of modern animation. When this film came out in 2010, I was enraptured and astonished by the beauty and colour of this northern world with its stalwart Viking society and wonderful variety of dragons. Who was responsible for that? Art director Pierre-Olivier Vincent? I'm sure it was a whole team of people. The 3D effects are spectacular. The engaging and heartwarming story (based on a book by Cressida Cowell) hits home for both kids and adults. Hiccup, the little Viking who could, is a great character. Some of it is cliché, but it didn't matter. Yes, I know it's a movie for kids, but there was something clever about it that raised it to a level that adults can appreciate. Kudos to DeBlois, Davies and Sanders for bringing us this imaginative, evocative and, yes, magical film. It's going to be hard to beat this in 2014, but they can certainly count on filling the seats.",9,2,3,7 April 2013
Don't Breathe," Good drama
","This is actually a pretty good movie. I recommend it if you're looking for something to watch. The basic plot is this: millennials break into a old blind guy's house to rob him, but end up fighting for their lives.This film has an unusual twist to it: the protagonists are the bad guys. Throughout the movie we are challenged with good and bad aspects of the two sides. There is some interesting moral ambiguity here. Who are we rooting for exactly? On the one hand, we have attractive millennials, possessing youth and sight, but living amorally and narcissistically. On the other hand, we have a blind old man who has lived a life of discipline and service, and is still a force to be reckoned with despite his age and blindness; however, he is creepy as hell, vengeful, and capable of using violence to defend himself. And he has a very mean dog.I'm not sure everyone would enjoy this kind of moral ambiguity.The most important character in this movie is the house. This is where the characters fight each other for their lives. Much of the tension of the movie comes from the fact that he knows his house, and the intruders don't.The film is worth about 7.5, but I'm going to round it up because it was just entertaining.",8,2,6,18 January 2017
Beauty and the Beast," Not special
","This is a Disney movie for young girls. I'm in the wrong demographic for this movie. Still I thought I might see it, because Disney movies are meant to appeal to all.I thought the first part was fairly slow and I almost fell asleep half way through. It picked up a little, but not enough.The movie is highly stylized and lacking in realism, which is not surprising, I suppose. We're in the world of ancient fairy tale, Disney fantasy and CGI. But there were many places where I found myself having to accept some contrived aspect that I didn't really want to accept.But then every so often the director showed us some beautiful animation, and the movie magic was there for a bit.The music and story didn't inspire me or even interest me really.I thought the whole anthropomorphic furniture/household thing was over done.I had a hard time with the 'beast' character. I mean, yes, he was half man half mountain goat (or whatever he was supposed to be) but he wasn't exactly a repulsive creature. He had muscles, strength, courage, hair, good looks, intelligence, education and sensitivity. This movie might have been more to the point if the beast had been truly hideous and unattractive. So I didn't really buy into the central moral dilemma of the movie, ie that a man-goat is hideous and that a human girl would never have feelings for a man-goat, or more importantly, that looks don't matter. Have I missed the point somehow?",7,4,8,9 April 2017
Les Misérables," I finally get Les Mis
","I'm not a Les Mis fan particularly. I saw the show live about 20 years ago, and was less than impressed. I remember not being able to understand many of the words. I found it all melodramatic, a little tedious. The whole thing is sung. I don't think there is a single word of dialogue. It's a modern epic opera with a few great songs.However, this movie performance of Les Mis brought the musical to life for me, and even quite moved me (both of which are strange considering its stylised and artificial nature). I enjoyed this movie much, much more than I enjoyed the live performance I saw. I think it's partly because the movie was subtitled in Dutch so I could follow every line. I was really surprised to be so moved by this movie. Who would have thought? I suppose you could say that I now finally get Les Mis.Putting it on film was a great idea and Hooper and his cast have done this classic justice. Jackman and Hathaway really stand out as great singers and performers. No one who sees this movie will ever look at these two actors again in the same way. I'm a huge fan of Crowe, a talented actor and singer, but I feel he was miscast here. I don't see him as the complex evil/tragic Valjean figure.I would give the movie a 9 or 10, were it not for the fact that I'm not particularly a Les Mis fan.",8,0,2,2 February 2013
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," A great sequel!
","This high-energy sequel is hugely entertaining from the opening scene to the very end. Highly recommended!This movie is very funny and, at times, ribald and camp. The real pleasure is not in the world-destroying, starship-battle action, but in the snappy, humorous dialogue and in the character conflicts. Chris Pratt and Zoë Saldana are sexy as hell. The soundtrack (yes, still based on Peter's Mom's 1960s cassettes) is uplifting and catchy. Even the other characters have adopted this music, and play it non-stop. At the end, quite unexpectedly, this movie becomes moving. Excitement, laughs, cheers, tears -- it's all there.I think it would be a great idea to see the first movie before you see this one. Volume 2 brings back the winning characters, musical theme and formula from the first movie, so don't expect too many changes. Groot is still alive -- although he is a mere, um, twig. We see more of the Ravagers. A new alien species is introduced: the strange, perfect golden Sovereign. One important new character is introduced: Peter Quill's father. This movie is essentially about him, and all is revealed.The film is worth about 8.5, but I'm rounding it up. Go see it!",9,2,4,7 May 2017
In Time," Snappy sci-fi
","Why is this movie not rated more highly? I've seen it twice now, and found it thoroughly engaging and entertaining even the second time around. The Darwinian premises are 'time is literally money' and 'earn money or die young'. The other premises are more Hollywood fantasy: 'look good' and 'live forever'. The conceit of being able to electronically transfer time to another person is neat, and neatly executed. I found it fairly easy to buy into. It's a gritty, snappy, sexy, well-written, well-acted science fiction film with social commentary that is not irrelevant to our modern world. Timberlake was great, as was Seyfried. OK, there were a few too many shootouts and chase scenes, but you expect that in every American movie. It's worth about 7.5 but I'll round it up.",8,3,4,28 April 2014
Mystic River," Don't get in the car...
","This dark movie transports us to a neighbourhood in blue-collar Boston, where good things tend not to happen.There is a constant undercurrent of trauma, violence, rage and revenge. Men turn to crime. Problems are solved by violence. Children are kidnapped and molested (by bishops, no less). Pedophiles are fully active. Children are murdered; children are murderers. Mothers are dreadful harpies. Pregnant wives run off. Men are killed by old friends. Lovers are killed by brothers. Wives suspect innocent husbands, but stand firmly behind the evil ones. Killers are punished, but not for their crimes. Killers go free, despite their crimes.For me the movie really ended when Silent Ray Harris and John O'Shea finally got sucked into this vortex. The cycle was complete. The trauma of a new generation was now fully in place. This was confirmed by the disturbed and haunted look in Dave's son's eyes as his guilty, guilty, guilty mother waves at him frantically from the sidelines of the parade. What chance does this boy have? What will happen to him is far worse than whatever happened to Dave. As Sean says needlessly at the end, 'we're all still boys locked in the cellar'.By the way, I can't say I was surprised by who dunnit. There were enough clues. I was surprised though by how the movie ended. Very dissatisfying. We're in a different moral universe--Mystic River. The acting was superb, but of course you knew that already, didn't you.",8,2,3,26 April 2012
Zero Dark Thirty," An important, gripping and technically competent historical drama
","This is an important movie. It is a technically superb docudrama that walks the movie goer through the arduous and controversial process that resulted in the killing of OBL.Every movie needs a hero, and in this movie the role is played by Maya (Jessica Chastain), a tenacious CIA employee who is portrayed as instrumental in finding OBL. The movie is more or less told from her perspective. The involvement of a strong woman represents the clash of values underlying it all. The presence of a dynamic, intelligent, career-oriented woman during the interrogation scenes and at the identification of OBL's body is hugely symbolic. This is why.It's astonishing how Bigelow was able to recreate everything so realistically (although I'm sure there are some aspects that are not realistic). She shows us several aspects of the hunt in much depth: the intelligence gathering, the CIA politics involved, the cultural clashes, the military operation, and so on. The movie has the feel of an interesting documentary or news story. The movie is long, but it doesn't feel long, which is quite remarkable when you think that this is a movie with a plot known to the viewer beforehand.I felt the movie was rather dispassionate. The climax was understated and lacking in triumphalism (apart from a bit of excitement from the soldiers involved). I certainly did not rejoice at the end. Why did the climax unexpectedly move me the second time I saw this movie? I suppose it's because I had a better feeling of the justice of it all.The one thing about this movie that really surprised me is the fact that most of it was set in Pakistan. Pakistan has a lot to answer for, it seems. Is Pakistan aiding or fighting terrorism? It seems unclear to me now.I didn't find the 'enhanced interrogation' scenes too difficult to watch. This movie doesn't condone it or condemn it: it simply shows it. The same treatment is given to the killings at the OBL compound. No punches are pulled. We are shown what happened. In this movie Bigelow portrays the stark reality, including the moral ambiguity of the process. The tone is one of fallible human endeavour, grim necessity, determined competence.",9,0,4,1 February 2013
Edge of Tomorrow," Cruise and Blunt shine in this SF thriller with a time-loop twist -- but with some tips for screen writers about writing about the military
","I really enjoyed this alien-invasion movie. Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt are both truly fantastic. The enemy is suitably terrifying. The story (each day relived over and over again) is quite interesting and well done, although of course not at all original. It's the kind of movie where you don't want to leave your seat because you might miss something.I'd give the move about an 8.5, but I'm going to round it down for the reasons explained below. Also, the movie didn't actually move me (except a bit at the very end). Another problem was that the shooting of the fast-moving spider thingies was getting a little tedious. An obvious sop for the video-game generation.I would definitely see this one if I were you! I saw it in 2-D, and it was fine. No need to pay extra.OK, script writers, listen up! There is a difference between recruit units and regular military units. Please stop writing dialogue and scenarios for regular military units that make them look like they are still in recruit training. For example, an NCO wouldn't and probably couldn't order regular soldiers (especially elite soldiers) to eat playing cards. They would think he had gone bonkers. Maybe in the Russian infantry...Another example: an overweight guy might appear in recruit training, but not afterwards and certainly not in an elite unit. There are very few overweight people in the kind of unit depicted in this movie. How would an overweight guy have been able to manhandle the exoskeletal suit and the rigorous combat training shown in this movie?I know ragtag soldiers are entertaining, but the real military (certainly in the US) doesn't tolerate it. Please stop making it look in movie after movie like military units are routinely filled with wisecracking, independent mavericks. Some odd behavior is tolerated in elite units, but this is based on a bedrock of professionalism. It's not ragtag.NCOs do not routinely refer to privates as 'maggots'. These are people the NCOs lead and work with every day. Why would they demean them in this way? This cliché misrepresents the nature of an NCO's leadership over private soldiers. A word like this might be used at a certain stage in basic training, but even then the word would be used carefully and only in the right context. It works partly because the training NCO doesn't see the private again after the recruit training is finished.In the military, it would be unusual, unprofessional, pointless and borderline abusive for an NCO to seriously address a complete stranger (even a lowly private convicted of desertion) as 'maggot'. Apart from that, surely as a professional writer you can see that 'maggot' is hopelessly cliché.On the eve of a major d-day, an NCO would not reprimand soldiers for mere gambling, especially elite soldiers. It wouldn't happen because tension and stress relief would be a major issue at that point. Nor would they do PT. The risk of injury would be too great. There would be equipment checks, forced rest, final briefings, special meetings, religious services, and so on.In the military, a deserter is not simply dumped into another military unit, especially an elite unit about to go into a d-day situation. No, a deserter goes to prison or gets some other suitable punishment. There is a difference between prison and the military. (Hard to see the difference from your mansion in Hollywood, I know.) If you were going to have an airborne assault like the one depicted in this movie, the DZ wouldn't be at the beach. No, that would make no sense.",8,3,8,31 May 2014
The Wolf of Wall Street," Sell me this pen
","Meet Jordan Belfort, a handsome, rich and amoral stock broker who lives the American dream by surfing the crest of Wall Street excess, ripping people off, and flying just under the radar. He is the penny-stock king, a showman and glib sales hack enriching everyone around him who is willing to embrace his ideals and methods. Here is another Gorden Gecko, but one stripped of nuance, decorum, sobriety, client responsibility or ethical sensibility.Scorsese shows us these excesses in broad strokes, almost in cartoon fashion. Everything is over the top in this movie. Belfort is not just loved by his staff; he's cheered by all his staff en masse, sometimes with tears pouring down their cheeks. He doesn't just do drugs; he does them constantly and in huge amounts. There are not just grand homes, luxury cars and yachts, but absolutely fabulous homes, cars and yachts. The movie does not just show us macho culture, it shows us office orgies and straight men being very openly sexual in front of each other. (Is this realistic, I'm wondering. I'm having a hard time with that.) Money, drugs and sex. Sex, drugs and money. Belfort is a drug addict and sex addict, but most of all he is a money addict, an addiction with no shame and no 12-step programme.We've all suspected it would be a lot of fun to be filthy rich like this, to be able to indulge every desire. We want this story to be true. This movie presents this adolescent male fantasy on the screen for the masses. Wouldn't it be great to be 30, no 14, again, and yet to have all the money in the world. F*ck social responsibility, morality, sobriety, ethics, the law. Who cares if someone gets hurt. (This movie doesn't show us that.) These men are having fun, the kind of fun some of us secretly imagine when we think about what it would be like to be stinking, amorally rich. It's porn. Not just sexual porn, but money porn. Titillating views of the American dream. Naked avarice in all its glory.Scorsese sucks the viewers in by making us laugh and showing us a good time. This movie is thoroughly entertaining. The sensationalizing and comedy humanizes these people and draws us into the movie as easily as if it were a ride at America's Wonderland.Of course, the chickens will come home to roost. Belfort (and we) are reminded of this half way through the movie. This is an American movie, after all, so moralizing is to be expected. Despite the fun, despite the ribald comedy, we see that Belfort is not a nice person at all and in the end hurts even the people close to him.However, Scorsese reminds us that the law is almost powerless to stop people like this. In the new America, the moralising is ineffective and soon turns into cynicism. Our hero is soon out, doing his thing to other people; the honest cop who put him in jail is still poor and riding the subway. The final scene of the movie shows us the hopeful, desperate faces of the poor sods who have been suckered in by Belfort to attend one of his get-rich-quick seminars. The show goes on. They are staring back at us from the screen. They are us. Money drives us all. We all want to get rich. We all love this movie.",8,2,7,30 December 2013
Dark Shadows," Sort of lame
","What would you call this movie -- a spoof? The problem was with the plot and the writing I suppose. I just didn't see the point of most of it. It seemed to be another kick at the Beetlejuice can (family deals with crazy character).Tim Burton has produced some great movies, but something went wrong with this one. Maybe I'm in the wrong demographic. I enjoyed the many 1970s references. This movie had a few laughs. However, mostly the fun seemed forced. The hippie scene, for example. The strange thing is that the performances delivered by Depp, Bonham Carter, Pfeiffer, Green and the others were actually quite good. Depp was amusing and seemed to be enjoying the hand thing. Bonham Carter is always good. I love her.When I attended this movie, there were only three people in the theatre. And I have to admit I dozed off during the first half hour.I want to give it a 5.5, but I've rounded it down.I'm surely not the only one who is a little tired of the vampire, zombie and werewolf theme. I refuse to go to a Twilight movie. Don't get me wrong. When they're well done, I enjoy them as much as everyone else. But they just seem to be everywhere lately. What is it with the popularity of this genre? I want to blame the Americans, but I suppose I can't. It's everywhere.",5,2,4,3 June 2012
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Left me restless and irritated
","It's now too late for me to make peace with the fact that the LOTR and Hobbit movies are just not my cup of tea. I've seen them all, out of a sense of duty more than anything else. I didn't really enjoy any of them, to be honest with you. I want to like them, but I just don't.I don't want to upset anyone with the details, but it's just all too arcane and fast-paced and artificial and filled with stalwart men and noble armies, noble causes and unexpected turnarounds. There were too many characters. It was too busy. New things kept popping up out of nowhere. I don't want my movies to be like video games. I'm not into video games. I don't need constant stimulation and sensation from my entertainment. Stimulation and entertainment are two different things.I also cannot abide the schmaltzy heroic speeches. GMAFB. It just felt staged. The bowman (whatever his name was) runs into a square and calls out 'where are my children'. Then out of this panicked mob, a woman stops and says, 'I know where they are'. Yikes. Thank god there was a bit of humour in the film.Was I moved at times? Yes, strangely. They do their utmost to elicit this in you. I felt manipulated.These movies require some kind of interest in this artificial fantasy world. There are so many 'universes' to keep track of out there now. What's the point? Who cares? The scenes they can show on CGI now are mind-boggling. I can't deny that. Maybe that's why I keep coming. However, isn't it being grossly overused? Not everything has to be spectacular. I think CGI is more effective if used in moderation.Once again, there is a huge disparity between the apparent fierceness of the orcs and how easy it is to kill them. I mean, c'mon. At times, I thought that the filmmakers were even parodying this. Like a child throws a stone -- boom, the orc is dead. Tauriel flicks her wrist - whoosh, the orc flies through the air. This is like a bad video game, isn't it? Why the gross disparity? It's just not believable. This ruined the action for me. This was also a problem in the second movie. I laughed aloud when the 12 dwarfs come storming out of the mountain, ready to face the horde. Heroic music swells --- yes, yes, these twelve dwarfs will save the day. So they rush into the formed satanic legions -- and nothing bad happens to them. The terrifying orcs scatter like marbles thrown on a floor.I did like Hobbit I (surprisingly), so I guess I was bullshitting there a bit. Hobbit III is better than Hobbit II, but not as good as Hobbit I. I'm sure this movie will satisfy many. Throughout the whole dreary series I tried to find meaning. Is this an allegory about defeating fascism and totalitarianism? Is this it? Or is it all meaningless.",6,1,4,1 January 2015
WALL·E," Brilliant animated science-fiction film with a strong message
","There's not much I can add after almost a thousand reviews. I agree with the collective wisdom of IMDb users. This is a wonderfully written and beautifully animated science-fiction movie with lovable, human-like robot characters.Yes, I suppose children might enjoy this film, but it is also aimed directly at adults. None of the characters in this movie are children (of the human, animal or robot kind). As charming and cartoonish as it is, 'Wall-E' is a rather intelligent, harsh indictment of American consumer culture. One of the themes is environmentalism; another is humanity's growing dependence on its machines.A huge amount of work must have gone into inventing and creating this film's version of the future Earth, and also the world of 'Axiom'. The way the creators were able to anthropomorphise the robots was remarkably creative. The movie reflects our own ambivalence: we love these little bots, but at the same time we see the danger. Can we ever live without them?Six years after release, this film still delights and amazes. It's difficult to think of a single thing to criticize about it.I can't say that I am a die-hard Pixar fan per se. Many of their films (eg Cars) don't work for me at all. This is one of the best of the bunch, right up there beside 'Finding Nemo'. Kudos to Andrew Stanton.After seeing it three times now, I'm tempted to give it 10, but 9 will do for now.",9,1,2,19 February 2014
Arrival," Alien language
","When I saw that Denis Villeneuve had made this science fiction film, I knew I had to see it. It's an intelligent, gripping movie about first contact with an alien species, specifically with our attempts to communicate with them. It turns out that communication with aliens may not be as easy as one would think! Especially when aliens do not have the same sense of time and language that we have. Learning an alien language would have a profound effect.The story is told in such a way that the viewer is left to figure it out. The plot is non-chronological. I admit I had to visit the internet afterwards to understand better what I had just seen. Amy Adams pretty well carries the movie on her own, and she pulls it off. A great movie.",9,5,11,27 December 2016
The Shawshank Redemption," A cinematic phenomenon
","What can I possibly add to a review corpus of over 1.2 million ratings and three thousand reviews? This movie has been called 'one of the best movies of all time', 'a powerful story about friendship, hope and freedom' and a 'latter-day retelling of the Gospel story'. Many people have seen this movie multiple times, and some claim it has changed their lives and even saved their lives.At this point, I'm rather more interested in the phenomenon than the movie. My take on it: this movie appeals enormously to ordinary people (especially American men) who feel trapped by difficult situations in their lives. Some may be looking to be rescued, like Red was; others may take comfort in the thought that their long-term pain, tedium and oppression will someday result in a spectacular liberating event. This movie satisfyingly scratches that annoying itch called 'life is unfair'.It's difficult to know what to think about all this. Whatever you think about the phenomenon, 'Shawshank Redemption' is also just a good movie with excellent writing, black and white characters, a simple but satisfying plot with a few surprising scenes, great acting, and a certain amount of tear jerking. It's not a movie to be missed.",8,3,5,1 August 2014
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," 'A thing is a thing, not what is said of that thing'
","This is a psychological drama about a Hollywood actor attempting a comeback on Broadway. However, this sentence doesn't begin to describe the complexity of what is going on in this film.'The Birdman' is an intelligent, well-written, brilliantly filmed and superbly acted movie. I thought it was spell-binding. I think it's worth about 8.5 but I'm going to give it a 9 for now.It's amusing how this film gets rather high scores, but yet the most upvoted reviews are the negative ones. There is a serious disconnect between review voting and movie voting on IMDb. From where I'm standing, it looks like the small minority of people who didn't like this movie came to the IMDb review section to express their disapproval en masse.",9,2,6,16 March 2015
The Big Short," The house of cards comes tumbling down
","I enjoyed every minute of this great movie. It tells the story of those who predicted the 2008 mortgage crisis and the financial disaster that would come afterward.Of course, no one believed them. Through their eyes, we see the system and the people that were responsible for the house of cards that would come tumbling down. It's a dark, bitter movie that attacks American capitalism in the solar plexus. However, there are light moments, and even some humour. It's always interesting to see the workings of capitalist America. Such huge amounts of money! It starts to lose all meaning.Everyone plays their roles well in this movie, but the one who stood out for me is Steve Carell. His character was very believable. The movie goer identifies with his sense of dread and nausea as he realizes what he's stumbled upon. Christian Bale's portrayal of the eccentric Michael Burry was also really interesting. A truly great actor.I wouldn't miss this movie if you enjoy learning something while getting entertained.",8,1,2,17 February 2016
Prometheus," Enjoyable, fast paced, visually beautiful
","I enjoyed the movie and recommend it to anyone interested in the Alien movies. It is just visually beautiful, particularly the scenes of space, the primordial earth and the alien world. The special effects are also impressive. The futuristic human and alien technology depicted is fascinating.This movie transports us 80 years into the future, when space travel, human-like robotics, anti-gravity devices and automatic medical operation chambers are a reality.Charlie and Elizabeth are two latter-day Erich von Danikens who have convinced Peter Weyland, trillionaire, of their theory that aliens not only have visited the earth but planted the genetic seed for mankind and then returned many times to explain this to later civilizations who integrated this revelation into their cultures. These scientists have even deduced the planet where these aliens came from.Weyland is convinced this theory is true. (And indeed it is. We are shown it at the start of the film.) He mounts a space mission to this far-away system. He puts ice-queen Meredith in charge. It takes years for the ship to reach this planet, the crew in suspended animation during most of the voyage. They are under the care of David, an enigmatic life-like robot both fascinated and repelled by his human creators.When they get there, they find evidence of intelligent design in the form of ancient hollow structures filled with corridors. After further exploration the aliens (called the Engineers) are revealed to them. They have left behind still-functioning chambers filled with strange urns and devices. Holographic recordings of the aliens are operating. Their bodies are preserved, even after 2,000 years. And finally they find a life-support pod with a live alien -- the very thing the scientists and Weyland were hoping to find. The alien is revived...During all this, we see that David and Meredith have agendas of their own. And we see that Weyland himself is still alive and on board. David has enough knowledge to deftly use some of the alien technology -- for unknown reasons -- to infect Charlie, knowing that Charlie would impregnate Elizabeth and knowing she might give birth to an alien creature. She doesn't though -- she is able to have the thing medically extricated from her. It is not killed however. At the same time we see that there are also living creatures in the alien structure. They attack two of the crew, one of which is used as a host to wreak havoc on the ship.I went into this movie with high expectations. From the trailers the movie seemed to be original and epic in the way that Avatar was. I was not aware that this would be an Alien movie. I enjoyed the Alien movies because of their gritty science-fiction realism, but I was disappointed that this turned out to be another movie in that franchise. This movie should have been marketed as an Alien movie.Normally I can suspend disbelief quite readily in an entertaining movie. However I had problems this time around.The rationale behind mounting such a huge, expensive space exploration operation was not sufficiently explained. For something like this to happen, wouldn't all of humanity have been aware of it and the reason for it? And yet even the crew apparently didn't know all the details.Why would Weyland spend so much to mount a mission of this kind and then select a ragtag group of people to crew it, especially an unstable person like Fifield? It seemed so pointless. These are people that a fast-food restaurant wouldn't hire. They engage in behaviour that co-workers at an ordinary office would never do.I know what happened: in the earlier Alien movies one of the interesting themes was 'Marines in space'. Marines are edgy people, but this was a scientific mission. It was annoying to see Fifield on board. What you would want are the solid people you find on a NASA mission.The people on this mission were so...clueless. They didn't seem to know each other. It didn't make sense that everything had to be explained to them when they woke up. And that they disagreed with each other about aspects of the mission (eg whether to bring weapons with them). Surely there would have been massive preparations and long training sessions before launching a trillion-dollar spaceship?? The intent was for these odd characters to make the movie more interesting, but it went too far.It was groan-worthy that they allowed themselves so freely to touch, and be contaminated by, this alien world. Not just once, but many times. The viewer of course is fully aware of the dangers, so it is implausible that these space explorers wouldn't have been. A flaw that screamed at the moviegoer, even sympathetic ones.When the mission of the Engineers became clear to Elizabeth, it just didn't seem, well, right. How did she draw that conclusion from what we had seen? And it seemed implausible that the crew would sacrifice themselves because of a few words shouted at them.Michael Fassbender's portrayal of David was astonishing. This ubiquitous actor's range is apparently limitless.Elizabeth and Charlie were too young and didn't come across as scientists. However, Rapace delivered a great performance as a tough survivor. I look forward to seeing Elizabeth and David in a sequel.Why did they use a young actor to play Weyland? Guy Ritchie was fine, but it was clear that this is a young man in old-guy makeup. Why didn't they just find an old actor? I suppose there must have been a reason for it.Theron (another great actress) played her character well, but the character's role in the movie was not dramatically effective. It's realistic to have someone like her on board though.One final comment: It's a good movie, a beautiful movie, an enigmatic movie, but not an original one.",8,6,13,3 June 2012
The Water Diviner," After Gallipoli
","This is another Australian movie exploring the legacy of Gallipoli, a First World War battle in which many ANZAC soldiers died and which has become iconic in Australian history. It is set in Australia, and Turkey, and tells the sad story of a man who has lost his sons, and goes to Turkey to find their remains. Flashbacks show the boys growing up in Australia and their experience of the horrors of the battle. This is not a war movie; it's a post-war movie.Interestingly, this movie shows more of, and is even sympathetic to, the Turkish side. Crowe has succeeded admirably in showing us what Istanbul must have been like during the Greco-Turkish War. Frankly, it bothers me that this movie demonised the Greek side (even though the harshness of the Greeks is an historical fact). This just seems wrong-headed to me given the genocides committed by the Ottoman Turks against the Armenians and Ottoman Greeks. Sort of like glorifying the Nazis. The fact that we don't understand this immediately is just sad. (I don't mean to slur Turkey itself, which is a wonderful country.)Crowe is the heart of this movie, and he carries it effortlessly. Kurylenko also delivers a good performance. Jai Courtney (for some reason, billed as the lead actor) is too smoking hot for a role like this, but I thought he pulled it off. What would an Australian movie be without beefcake? The movie worked for me. I was moved at times. However, the sentimentality and stereotyping was a little too much for me. Yes, we get it, the Australians suffered horribly at Gallipoli. At times the film seemed too simplistic and movieish. The supernatural part didn't appeal to me either. I'm glad I saw the movie, but I could have skipped it.",7,5,12,18 April 2015
Wonder Woman," 'Magnificent as she is'
","I've been thinking a lot about this movie since I saw it. If you had told me a month ago that I would go to (never mind enjoy) a Wonder Woman movie, I would have written you off as bonkers. And yet that's what has happened. I enjoyed this movie, although there were some aspects of it that I didn't buy.This movie is about female empowerment v. male violence (represented here by the Great War). Diana v. Ares. Much of the fun of the film was in seeing Diana experience the modern world (well, the world a century ago) and seeing whether her idealism would crack under the weight of reality.I liked Wonder Woman, played by Gal Gadot. She was indeed 'magnificent' (as Ludendorff needlessly points out to the viewers), a shining light. Diana is propelled into an extraordinary adventure, and yet handles everything that comes her way. It is an important mission that gives her society, her family and her life meaning. There was a lot to enjoy here, including her formation, her beliefs, her innocence and idealism, her determination, her shock at the modern world. Just awesome.They did a great job in showing how WW could work as a superhero. I just had not bought into it before (shield? lasso? bracelets? -- c'mon). But they made it work. Some real cleverness there.One major theme in this movie is female athleticism. It's not just women engaged in, um, ancient Greek martial arts though. (In this regard, it's similar to 'The 100'.) I really have no idea how they do it, but the result is spectacular. I suppose it's a combination of martial arts, gymnastics, choreography, CGI animation and cinematography. Once it is all combined for the viewer on the screen, the result is exciting and appealing.These were powerful women, portrayed (as far as I know) in a way never shown on the screen before. It felt new and different, although I suppose it's what we see now in Crossfit competitions and shows like Steve Austin's Broken Skull Ranch. For anyone who hasn't seen these things, I'm sure the depiction in this movie was mind-blowing. Showing this aspect of the movie in a convincing way must have been a huge undertaking on the part of the filmmakers. I think this was successful.Another important theme in the movie is the Great War. This is a war most of us don't hear about much anymore. We've all seen the historical footage and historical movies attempting to show it to us. I'm not sure the movie was accurate in depicting this war as genocidal and oriented at mass destruction. It wasn't, was it? This bothered me. The portrayal of the war here was different than one I'm used to. This movie attempts to show it in a way that is relevant to its theme ('Ares must be destroyed') and interesting to modern internet-generation viewers (especially those demanding action). Whether this depiction of the Great War was successful I am less certain, but they get an 'A' for effort.I didn't like the Trevor character. I blame the writing and story here. His job was to be the foil to Diana, and most of it didn't work for me. It didn't help that I'm generally not into Chris Pine. I think Pine was given a very tough role here. There is a lot more I could say about this, but I will refrain.I didn't buy Capt Trevor's little gang of misfits on the front. Sorry, but I just didn't feel they belonged on the front or in the movie. When they were on, I played on my phone.Ares was 'meh'.This is the thing: I feel that this movie had some tedious aspects and some awesome aspects. Yes, the two themes were dealt with in a camp way -- how else could you deal with it in a Wonder Woman movie? -- but I admired the effort. This movie is worth about 7.5.",7,3,9,16 June 2017
Taken 2," An invincible hero, prolonged fights, shootouts and car chases.
","I didn't hate this movie, but I didn't really enjoy it either. The movie consists almost wholly of the boring devices you see in many modern movies nowadays: an invincible hero, prolonged fights, shootouts and car chases.It also had a few torture scenes (without too much gore). I thought the movie was too violent, but I'm thinking that about a lot of movies lately.OK, this movie included a cool chicken run on a train. And it had a chase on the very same Istanbul rooftops they showed in Skyfall and about a dozen other movies. Every filmmaker loves that location.If you love Istanbul, you'll enjoy the backdrops in this movie. Istanbul itself is a fabulous city. However, this movie made it look like the whole city revolves around the Grand Bazaar and Hagia Sofia. And are there really so many women wearing burqas in Istanbul?? The exposition and character development at the start went on for too long -- and it didn't really work. All three of them annoyed me (although for different reasons).I thought the movie portrayed the Albanians rather unsympathetically. Just black and white, really. Americans good; Muslim Albanians bad.",6,0,1,28 November 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," A movie for its own sake
","I felt this movie was pretentious, pompous, melodramatic, grandiose, sensational, stagey, over the top, contrived. Everything had momentous significance. This was a big movie that took itself far too seriously. A movie for the movie's own sake.There wasn't enough exposition. The viewer was not properly reacquainted with the characters and with earlier events. I barely remember the earlier movies. I don't really remember the business with Harvey Dent. Who is Ra's al Ghul again? This aspect was very annoying. I felt much of the plot was difficult to understand. For example, the kidnapping of Dr Pavel was admittedly amazing film-making -- this is where Nolan shines -- but I just didn't understand who he was and why they were doing it. Where did Bain get the money and technical expertise to do it? What were the motivations of this group? Obviously they were highly trained, but by whom? Who is Bain? None of this is explained. We're just left to watch this scene without context. Indeed, this scene is not really important to the plot. It's just an amazing scene added to the movie for that reason alone.I had a hard time with the Bain character: was he a brute or this incredibly wealthy and intelligent mastermind? Surely, he can't be both. Life just doesn't work that way. The scene where he pummels Batman while making these highly articulate comments...yikes, that's when the movie lost me during my first viewing (I left). So why did Bain hate Batman so much? Why did he banish Batman to the pit in Uzbekistan rather than just kill him in the tunnels? Later, the scene in the stadium, when he explained at length his elaborate plan for Gotham City, just seemed utterly ridiculous to me. (During my second viewing, this is when I had to walk out of the theatre to take a ten minute break.) Why did he hate Gotham City so much? We don't know. Quite a few of the plot developments didn't seem believable to me. ~ How could it be so easy to divest Wayne of his billions? ~ How did Batman survive the journey all the way to the pit in Uzbekistan when he had a protruding vertebrae? ~ Can human beings survive for years in this pit in Uzbekistan? ~ Why do the police in Gotham City conduct operations en masse and in block formation? ~ Are we expected to believe that thousands of them survived for months, including into the winter, while trapped in tunnels? And that when they came out they were clean and ready to go? ~ How did Bain manage to plant all those explosives all over Gotham City without anyone noticing? ~ The US, with all its money and military forces, were unable to get Gotham City out of Bain's clutches. No, only one man, Batman, could save Gotham. Anyway, you get the idea. It went on and on. I don't need believability in a movie necessarily, but in order for a viewer to suspend disbelief you have to give the viewer a reason. Maybe characters to care about. Batman conquering his fear of death in the pit in Uzbekistan and the 'revolution' in Gotham City both just seemed pointless. Why not just kill Batman? Why not just destroy Gotham City? OK, I get it that this is a movie requiring drama and action set in a cartoon world and telling a comic book story. I suppose the problem is that it was trying to be so much more than that. These plot developments were too contrived.It astonishes me that so many people have given this movie such high scores and such good reviews, given all this. In my view, giving this movie a score of 8.8 simply discredits the IMDb ratings process. Something is askew here. Apparently there are a lot of people out there that want to see movies like this. Not only do they enjoy movies like this, but they actually see this as the epitome of movie making. One final point: I used to be a big fan of Batman. Many years ago, I used to know exactly when a new issue of the Batman comic book would arrive in our local cigar store. On that day I would head down and hand over my 12 cents. Often I would finish reading it before I even got back home. And after school I used to watch the Batman TV show. Yes, the one with Adam West. (Admittedly I was more into Superman though.)Nolan directed 'Momento' and 'The Prestige', two movies I really enjoyed. I also thought 'Inception' was an interesting film. So my problem is not with Nolan as director, but with what has become of these Batman movies. Maybe I should just accept that these Batman films are aimed at a different demographic and stop going to them.",5,5,10,23 October 2012
The Croods," Unpretentious and funny
","The start of the film threw me off. Yes, it is a cartoon for children, but I was initially annoyed by the fact that there was no attempt at verisimilitude at all. The creatures were not realistic. Their world is not realistic. The things these cavemen do is not realistic. I would have preferred a film that at least attempted to show us what the world would have been like for these people.The movie seems to have been set during the Great Bottleneck that occurred around the Toba disaster. The Crood is a sort of animalistic Neanderthal-like family that learns key lessons from the apparently more evolved Guy.It bothered me that these cavemen were so....American-sounding, and that they were being used as a vehicle to portray modern American family dynamics.I suppose this animated movie was meant to be seen on a huge screen in 3D; however, I saw it on a very small screen on an airplane.Because of these three things I was sorely tempted to switch to a different movie.However, I stuck it out. Before long I found myself enjoying the comedy, the beauty of some of the animation, and the imaginative portrayal of this ancient world. Cartoons are not supposed to be realistic. Some of the natural scenes depicted reminded me of Avatar. At times the movie is hilarious. This is an unpretentiously fun movie.It struck me that kids in particular would love this film and its simple message that 'Dad's rules may not always be right but Dad is a good guy who in the end will look out for you'. The other themes are that 'rules are made to be broken' and 'get out of your cave and explore the world'. Probably a useful message for the internet generation.",7,0,0,11 December 2013
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Difficult movie
","I had a hard time following this movie, especially in the first half. I don't know what was wrong. Some of it may have been me, I suppose. At least part of it was the movie. The scenes involving Batman went on too long for me. (I'm not particularly a fan of the modern movie Batman.) I'm reluctant to see the movie twice, although I suppose that's what I would have to do to understand it. I resent the fact that I spent money on a movie and yet found it difficult to follow.I also had a hard time buying into the premise that Superman and Batman would be so antagonistic to each other, and then ultimately at each other's throats. It just all felt counter-intuitive to me. I don't quite know what the point of it was.But there were a few interesting concepts (e.g. Superman hero worship as the deification of an alien) and a few amazing scenes.And cripes they brought in Wonder Woman. Sorry I just lost interest at that point.These muscle-suit superhero movies don't appeal to me particularly. There has to be something clever about it, but there was little cleverness here. It was all action and superego. I thought the darkness of the movie was rather fascist.I'm giving the movie 6/10, but I may go see it again in order to understand and appreciate it better.",6,0,3,18 April 2016
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," One grand, beautiful scene after the next
","I love a good Elizabeth movie as much as anyone else. In fact, just a few days before I saw this film, I had seen a 1939 film (Private Lives of Elizabeth & Essex) starting Bette Davis and Errol Flynn. It was fascinating to be able to compare these two movies from two different eras, to see how modern cinematography has developed in its depiction of Elizabeth and the late 16th century.Perhaps unsurprisingly not much has changed with regard to Elizabeth's appearance and clothing. At least in modern movies Elizabeth is allowed to take her make-up and dress off once in a while. Even take baths.In the 1939 movie, the theme was the love affair between Elizabeth and the Earl of Essex. This 2007 movie is set somewhat earlier, but it also shows the emotional life of Elizabeth, including her feelings for Walter Raleigh.I thought that the performances in the movie were excellent. Cate Blanchett was marvellous. So was Samantha Morton and Geoffrey Rush. Clive Owen too was really good, especially at the start where he is trying to catch the queen's eye. His tale of making the crossing and reaching the new world was as gripping for the viewer as for Elizabeth. Say what you want about Clive Owen, he's good.In this movie many of the scenes were achingly beautiful. At times it was like looking at a collection of Old Masters in a museum. The lighting, colour, costumes and rich settings were all used to their best advantage.The beauty of the scenes became so striking at times, however, that the artifice kept leaping out at me. At times it was so obviously beautiful, so clearly romantic, that it seemed staged and posed.I really didn't mind this aspect though. I can't get enough of modern attempts to display medieval and renaissance life. Seriously. There must be many fascinating aspects of the period that have yet to be shown on film.OK, perhaps there was a bit too much jingoism in there. I understand that Elizabeth is a patriotic figure to the English (or at least to English filmmakers), but Elizabeth the virgin guardian angel of England? Elizabeth the warrior queen? Elizabeth the mother of her people? This is wishful thinking on the part of the director and themes that don't work for me. I suspect that English people however swell with patriotism when they see Elizabeth portrayed as a virgin-mother-warrior-angel-queen in full Renaissance finery. Even in the 1939 film the Americans did this in an old-Hollywood sort of way.The highlight of the movie for me was the execution of Mary and Elizabeth's anguish at what had happened. Morton played this brilliantly. Blanchett brought to life the doubts about it and the horror of it all. Walsingham did what he had to do, but what a mess this conflict between Protestant and Catholic really was. What did bloody Mary do to deserve this? After the movie I looked it all up on Wikipedia. Mary was actually married to Philip II of Spain. I had forgotten that fascinating detail. History could easily have gone the other way. This movie did not portray the Spanish in a way that I would consider realistic. I'm sure they were not all crazed religious zealots. No more so than English Protestants like Walsingham.There was somehow a problem with the plot or writing. The film seemed a little disjointed, jumping from one grand, beautiful, melodramatic scene to the next. I was on the director's side right up until the scene where Elizabeth exhorts her troops on horseback. That went too far. Even Cate Blanchett was unable to pull that one off.Still I enjoyed the film. It's under-rated on IMDb. I'm not sure why.",8,0,0,11 May 2012
Saving Mr. Banks," Who could have expected a movie like this from Disney?
","A Disney film about the making of Mary Poppins.I really wasn't sure whether I wanted to see this. However, I'm so glad I did. Director John Lee Hancock and his writers have unexpectedly given us a superb heart-warming drama about Helen Goff's coming to terms with the Disneyfication of Mary Poppins, a story (as we all now know) that reflected her youth on a farm near Allora, Queensland.For Goff (a.k.a. 'Pamela Travers'), the Mary Poppins story is inextricable from her memories and feelings about her beloved father. She needs the money, but she feels that only she understands the true meaning of Mary Poppins. She is terrified of how Disney will transform her storyand fail to do justice to her father's legacy. Departures from her original story, but especially the addition of music and animation, seem outrageous to her.The theme is 'letting go'. This movie is actually a sophisticated, intelligent psychological drama. Because she is the adult child of an alcoholic, Goff carries much of the complicated emotional baggage that goes with that. Her feelings about her father are complex, deeply rooted and only half understood. The process of creating the movie, and dealing with Disney, draws her back to her childhood, connecting her to her inner child. The question is whether she can learn to live in the present.I have to admit that, at both views four years apart, this movie moved me to tears -– but without being sappy or melodramatic. I hope this doesn't make the movie sound too heavy; the film is actually quite light in its feel, funny at times, and easy to digest. Surely though this is a film for adults.Emma Thompson is the Oscar-worthy epicentre of this film, although the rest of the cast (especially Colin Farrell as her father and Tom Hanks as Walt Disney) certainly pull their weight. Emma Thompson's mastery of her profession shines through here.I am not at all a Disney freak who walks around the theme parks with Micky Mouse ears. However, this movie has me -– four decades after I sat transfixed in the theatre watching Mary Poppins for the first time –- appreciating this company on a new, different level. This movie spoke directly to me. Yes, it is a Disney movie about a Disney movie, but it is also much more than that.",9,2,5,30 December 2013
Thor: The Dark World," Superhero movie in which universe is saved by wacky humans
","I truly enjoyed this film. The special effects are astonishing, as one expects in movies like this nowadays.But in the end it's just another typical latter-day sensational superhero movie. The elaborate alternative universe (i.e. the dark elves arising once again to use the evil gassy thing to destroy Asgard and the nine worlds) was a little too much for me. I enjoy a good movie, but I've reached the point where I am not that interested in being presented with new universes, in this case 'the Thor universe'. I didn't really care what happened to Asgard.I understand this is an action film oriented towards the video-game generation, and many movie goers want to see action on a grand scale. Moviegoers apparently want demon warriors, medieval empires and frightening alien technology in their movies. Well, I'm getting tired of it.I thought something went wrong with the portrayal of the group of Earth characters on which this franchise is focused. We didn't get to know them well enough. They were portrayed as corollary and wacky and frantic -- and yet they were able to develop this strange and powerful device out of nowhere. They were not true scientists. They were...what exactly? I don't get Jane Weston. Something is wrong with that character and her role in this movie, and perhaps also the way she is portrayed.There was too much action, and not enough plot and character development. There were too many coincidences, too many forced and contrived situations. (The stupid intern throws the car keys into the hole! Jane gets transported right to a small cavern deep underground, which just happens to be the worst place possible! Thor figures out in seconds how to fly an alien aircraft like a pro!) There were too many bone crushing fights and city destroying disasters.I went to this movie (and its predecessor) because...well...I think Chris Hemsworth is eye candy. He duly delivers. This is the perfect role for him. However, I'm ready to see him in a proper movie where he's given a chance to flesh out a character.There are some nice moments in the movie. I can't say I didn't enjoy it. It's better than the Batman movies. It's worth about 7.5 I'd say, but I'm going to round it down for now. I go to these movies, but maybe I shouldn't.",7,0,1,14 November 2013
Lucy," Riveting sci-fi masterpiece
","I've seen this movie twice now, and I loved it both times. As a long-time science fiction fan, I particularly enjoy idea-driven sci fi that crosses over into philosophy or psychology, and provides a different, unusual angle about important topics.This movie does not only that, but it is also well acted, well written, fast paced, snappy international, intelligent and unpredictable. It certainly keeps you on the edge of your seat. This movie has the same appeal to me as Blade Runner or 2001 or Close Encounters. Yes, it's that good. I enjoyed the cinematography, the music, the various freaky visual treats (eg the changing eyes, the cellular dissolution, the space images, the advanced computer, and much more.) This is a movie that showed me things I have not seen on film before. It enflamed my imagination.Scarlett is amazing in this movie. Her fear at the start was almost difficult to watch. I was moved when she said goodbye to her mother so profoundly. Her anguish on the plane felt shockingly real. I'm not a Morgan Freeman fan (because I feel he is overexposed), but he was good in this one, too. I also loved the look in Waked's eyes as his hard-cop-who-has-seen-everything witnesses the impossible. Great acting.The theme has been done before, but this take on it was new and well executed. Is the main premise scientifically accurate? No. Was the philosophizing over-the-top hogwash? Probably. But is it possible to suspend disbelief and go along with it? Yes. The movie has a certain profundity and WTF factor.Am I right in thinking that both this movie and Gravity (another incredibly good recent picture) were not made in Hollywood? Or even America? This movie is bursting with action, but it is so much better than the superhero action movies Hollywood keeps spitting out lately. This is the kind of movie I dream of seeing when I'm sitting through yet another tedious Batman or Captain America movie.This movie attracts a proportionately high number of 'haters', i.e. reviewers who downvote good reviews and write reviews rubbishing it. Not sure why this movie is attracting that kind of negativity. It might explain the ridiculous 6.6 score on IMDb currently.This is my second attempt to post this review. The first review ended up being score-bombed by 15 negative voters in one day. Not sure how or why something like that happens. My review was on the first page and after that it ended up on page 15 or something. All this raises serious doubts in me about the accuracy of the IMDb scoring system.Unusually, I find myself amongst the outlier group that strangely rates a movie 10 when everyone else is on the bell curve. OK, I suppose I can't give it a 10 because it does have a few minor issues. There are (spectacular) car chases and (too many) shoot outs. There is violence and a bit of gore too, but it wasn't graphic enough to make me queasy.I think this film is going to be a cult classic. Movie world, please make more movies like this.",9,5,13,23 August 2014
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," It didn't work for me really
","I guess I'm not an Abrams fan. There, I said it. I think he's almost ruined the Star Trek franchise. Sure, he's producing the action-filled and CGI-based sci-fi that young men 16 to 21 years of age want to see, but his work seems to lack originality, thoughtfulness, cleverness. I just don't find it that entertaining. He's good at fast-paced adventure, but that's not really what I want out of a movie.What can I say about the rest of it? It was all competently done, but it just didn't seem new, original or exciting. It dragged on.The return of the old cast was an interesting twist, but to me it just highlighted how the later movies have failed to develop a cast of equal impact.The high score has been bestowed on Abrams by his teenage male fans. The rest of us just didn't like it that much, I suppose.My heart sank when I saw that Oscar Isaac was in this movie because I think it's beneath his talents. But I appreciated his part in the movie. I like everything he does, really.So I want to give this movie about 7.5. I'm going to round it down to 7 because I spent most of the movie on my smart phone.",7,4,11,17 February 2016
Unbroken," If you can take it, you will make it
","So I open up the TA review page for this movie, and almost every review on the first page is really negative... what the heck? If you click through to the scores, you'll see that most people are rating this movie quite highly. Why does IMDb give it 7.2 at the time of writing and why are all these negative reviews being upvoted to the first page? Something strange going on there.This is a good movie, worth at least about 8/10. It tells the story of a man in extremis (lost at sea and then imprisoned in a brutal Japanese POW camp). All the themes of that genre are explored here. Sh*t happens; sometimes horrible sh*t. Do you accept what life has thrown you or do you heroically battle on? The main thrust of the movie is: will he survive? But it is also the true story of Louis Zampirelli, apparently a remarkable man, and it is told quite realistically and in harrowing detail. In essence: Louis was an Olympic athlete who became a fighter bombardier in the USAF during WWII. He was lost at sea for almost two months, only to be rescued by the Japanese, who treated their POWS brutally. Finally, it is the story of a specific war and the reality of Japanese camps. We have lost track over the last generation about the cruelty committed in that theatre, so this is a timely reminder. Some of these men are still alive. I saw the fanaticism of Watanabe as having echoes in today's news. It had me thinking that maybe Jolie was trying to send a message to the US: we have dealt with fanaticism before and won.I was deeply moved at times.To me, the movie had an unexpected elegiac, iconic or epic feel to it. I suppose that's to be expected. I noticed the same in Fury (perhaps not accidentally starring Jolie's husband, Brad Pitt). The people who lived through that war are not making movies anymore so we don't see it through their eyes here. The new generation seems to want to show the grim reality of the war but also the heroism of the 'Greatest Generation'. We are on the edge of losing all the people who fought in that war. It's as if we need to acknowledge their greatness.Somehow the result comes across as a little artificial to me. We cannot reproduce the earnestness and cinematic style of the 1940s and 1950s. And frankly: isn't heroism dead? 'If you can take, you will make it.' Does that resonate at all with the internet generation?One aspect of the movie that bothered me a little: the men who went to that war did not all look like muscular young models. We apparently can no longer find young male actors with ordinary bodies.",8,2,6,17 January 2015
Pitch Perfect," Fun and uplifting
","This is an amusing, uplifting and really enjoyable movie. I was chuckling throughout. It had a lot of smart and sometimes off-the-wall humour. Yes, it's girly stuff mostly, but it's done in a way that would appeal to anyone.The songs and performances were great. I hope the performances were all real, but you never know of course. And perhaps it doesn't matter.Imagine a university subculture based on a cappella music performances. Really good performances. The students in this subculture are nerds with issues, but sheesh are they talented. And some of them are attractive too. This university has no less than four aca-groups. (Does this sort of subculture really exist at American colleges?) Shows like 'Glee' and 'America's Got Talent' are barely on my radar, but even I can tell that this movie is of that ilk.I can't remember the plot. Something about competitions, boy meets girl, letting people in, pleasing dad and not being controlling.All the characters were well portrayed by the various actors, but the one young lady who stood out for me was Brittany Snow (who plays Chloe). This is a young actress to keep an eye on.Jason Moore and the writers have done a good job with this, as has everyone involved in producing the music and performances.",8,3,7,22 January 2013
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," It's OK
","This movie is science fiction set in a distant future in which part of North America is divided into 12 zones, with some zones wealthier and more advanced than others. Television still plays a huge role in this future society. Television producers are able to create elaborate fantasy worlds.For historical reasons, each zone is required to select a young man and young woman to participate in a reality show that is essentially a mutual hunt to the death combined with an escape from deadly special effects. The story focuses on the experiences of one engaging and attractive young couple from a particularly poor district.In the last movie, they won the contest. We see that they were given money and nice homes, but Katniss is struggling with her fame and the horror of the games. In this movie, they and other former victors are -- much to their dismay -- called back to do the whole thing over again. It seems that the Capitol district (which runs the rest of the zones in a totalitarian dictatorship) is getting concerned about revolutionary feelings in the poorer worker districts.The current score is too high. The amount of money this movie is bringing in is a phenomenon I don't really understand. I suppose I'm in the wrong demographic. It's an OK movie, but it's annoying at times. It felt artificial, too black and white, and too cloying. Yes, I was occasionally moved, but this involvement came at a price, i.e. the slimy feeling of being manipulated. This movie is not that different really than an extended 'Survivor' episode.I don't buy into the Hunger Games universe. I don't see it as realistic in any way. The demonization of President Snow bothered me. OK, we get it. He's evil. I enjoyed the off-the-wall characters played (excellently) by Stanley Tucci and Elizabeth Banks.",7,2,14,30 November 2013
Godzilla," Surprisingly good
","I don't like this genre, and had low expectations for this movie, but by God(zilla) this movie was good. The disaster and monster scenes were spectacular.The pacing and plot were OK. The movie held my interest. Some of it was surprising. There were a few breathtaking scenes. My one true groan was when Brody told his wife he would come to rescue them. Yeah, right.The cinematography in the non-CGI scenes was noticeably good.I liked the Japanese theme of much of the movie.I thought the writers and directors (and especially Bryan Cranston, who's brilliant) did a good job in injecting the story with a human element To me, the movie had an appealingly earnest feel to it, although at times I felt the pull on the heart strings was a little too obvious.Much of the movie consists of scenes involving the American military, including an awesome halo jump. The military is presented here as heroic and competent. There were remarkably few groans about this.Aaron Taylor-Jones surprised me. He was cast against type, in my view. (Was that on purpose?) For one thing, he's just too young for this role. Yet he did a fairly good job playing the stalwart hero. And he's certainly easy on the eyes. I'd say that he carries this movie successfully. I particularly liked the scene in the nest, but I won't spoil it.This movie has led me to think that I might enjoy movies in the future with Taylor-Jones in it, something I didn't think before. In this movie, he's sort of like the beautiful guy you can't help falling in love with even though you know he's an arrogant narcissist who's just going to be a lot of work.I'd give it around 8. I can't say I was moved at any point. This movie is better than the other 'giant destroyer' movies out there. (But really I wish movie makers would just give up on these city-destroying movies. 9/11 was 14 years ago. We've processed it already.) Oh yes, one final thing: I wish they had called this movie Gojira rather than Godzilla.",8,9,19,16 May 2014
Looper," Gripping time-travel story
","This is a gripping thriller based on a future time-travel scenario. This complicated and intelligent movie was written and directed by Rian Johnson. Kudos to him, because he's really created a movie that has movie goers sitting on the edge of their seats.Gorden-Levitt and Willis were well cast and played their roles believably like the good actors they are.I enjoyed Johnson's vision of the future in 2044 and 2074. It seemed realistic to me (although why is the future always so bleak?) OK, maybe the movie was too violent at times. The hero of the movie is a hired killer and essentially we're shown one murder after the next. Lots of shootouts too. I can't say the violence was gratuitous since killing was what this movie was all about. If this kind of thing upsets you, I wouldn't see it.There was one horrible scene in particular. However, it wasn't that this particular scene was gory, it was just that the implication of what was happening was horrific. Admittedly, it fit right into the plot.I had no problem following the story, although it is a little complicated. There were a few minor plot problems. I think the movie might have been stronger by showing us in more detail what evil the Rainmaker causes in the future. It's still not clear to me why the Rainmaker was trying to close the loops. I think Joe could have used more character development.Of course, very few time-travel stories are able to deal adequately with the inherent paradoxes and butterfly effects that make time travel logically impossible. This one barely tries. Indeed, it makes changing the past part of the story, as if the paradoxes don't exist.But none of this ruined the movie for me.",8,0,2,25 November 2012
Life," Visceral, claustrophobic and dark
","This film is like Gravity and Alien, but with more of a horror element.It's a dark, visceral and claustrophobic film that shows you the collision of two worlds. No, not Mars and Earth, but science and the unknown. What happens when scientists come across an alien that is not studiable, not knowable, not interested in playing the game. It's a first contact story, but one in which everything goes terribly wrong. The nightmare here is not one of misunderstanding or miscommunication (like Arrival) but the sheer inability to co-exist. It's about an unstoppable creature from Mars that kills in terrifying ways. From the start, the awful realization is that the entire human race is in danger. I'm not going to lie to you: I am not sure I enjoyed this film. I'm a fan of sci-fi, not Cronenburg-style horror. As soon as I realized what kind of a creature this was, I foresaw the entire movie. Too bad the people actually involved in it all didn't foresee it in the same way. They had to go through it all. The alien in this movie will remind you of every filthy thing you fear when walking through a marsh. This alien is definitely the star of the show, a work of creative genius.The cinematography showing the earth and the space station was credible and beautifully done. If you're going to this movie to drool over Reynolds and Gyllenhaal, don't bother. Unsexiest movie ever.Good performances from everyone, especially Dihovichnaya and Sanada.It's worth about 7.5, I suppose. If this kind of film appeals to you, go see it. But don't expect a light, feel-good experience. And, um, maybe we really shouldn't explore Mars.",8,1,4,22 June 2017
Deadpool," A wise-cracking superhero for teenagers and geeks
","I can understand why 16-to-25-year-old geeky guys (i.e. the internet generation) would love this movie. It's a fast-paced video-game ride of a movie with many, many wise cracks, self-deprecating humour and cultural references. It has an overtly camp edge to it. Much of this movie constitutes a running dialogue between Wade and his adolescent viewers. This movie is cool, camp, sexy and violent. (The violence and sex in this movie are not that over the top. I saw nothing that really made me squeamish. It is more graphic than most movies. There was an extended torture scene that made me a little uncomfortable..)The movie's themes are the themes of adolescence in the early 21st century: sci-fi, superhero movies (yes, the movie's genre was also a theme), fitting in, rebellion, anxiety about personal and professional failure, angst about disease, looks and getting the girl, stalking, cruelty, bullying, alienation, feminism, sexuality, etc.The movie doesn't even pretend to be realistic. Yes, I know it's a movie about a comic-book figure, but c'mon there has to be something realistic about it. And it's not adult in any way. You know what I'm talking about. This is not a movie for adults.I have to go back to see the movie twice because much of it was too fast. The movie was funny, but the kind of funny where you feel afterwards that you didn't quite get the joke. Cultural references hurled at the viewer do not make a movie intelligent. I did get some visceral enjoyment out of it all. I was mildly moved on a few occasions, and I did chuckle out loud. But at the end -- despite its attempts to be an anti-superhero movie -- much of it was just the same loud, over-the-top bust-everything-up superhero cr*p you see in all these films. The big scenes here are the same old sh*t: big crashes, disasters, shootouts, kung-fu fighting. I thought at one point that the film was made for young men who have grown up with difficulties focusing and require a barrage of snappy dialogue and crashes to enjoy anything.It's really just another Marvel X-men movie. Nothing wrong with that, I suppose. I really liked the last one, so that's two good ones in a row. It's just that I don't need all my movies to be franchise movies about Marvel comic figures or anything else. Let's do other things once in a while. This movie didn't blow me away as much as that Galaxy movie.I want to give it about 7.5. I have to round it down because I can't say this movie was all that great. It's somebody else's 10, 9 or even 8. It's a 7 to me.",7,3,14,29 February 2016
Cloud Atlas," Epic
","There is some cool science fiction, action and adventure in this movie. The stories told are interesting and beautiful. Even if you don't care about the movie's message, I think you could also just go and enjoy it for the entertainment value.But this is actually an epic movie, a movie with a message, an intelligent movie with profound themes. The main point is that everything is an interconnected rich tapestry, a truth that has profound implications relating to human dignity, liberty, art, spirituality, and so on.The movie gives us this message not just in the content, but in its form, technique and even its acting. The movie is composed of six individual stories set in different times and different places. They are completely different stories and different genres.Each story itself is a complex mini-movie about 30 minutes long. Most of them are set in beautiful locations. Each story can stand independently, having its own characters, plot and finale and depending heavily on its particular genre, but still dealing with the primary themes. The various stories are not subtle: each has clear heroes and villains. This is a world of good guys and bad guys.The movie weaves these stories together, showing us occasionally the ways that they are interrelated. Sometimes the interrelationship is obvious and forced: the director cuts from one scene to the next to make that point. Sometimes the interrelationship is not obvious or glaring, but subtle and mysterious. The movie goer is invited to figure it out.The characters and actors are also interconnected, in the sense that each actor plays a handful of roles. This was so well done that I was shocked when I checked out the cast on IMDb after I got home. I could tell that some actors were playing double roles, but I missed three quarters of it.The actors play different sides (from hero to villain, and vice versa), different genders and even different races. Some of it was obvious and I can see why some might think it inept. On the other hand, I accepted the movie's message that the distinction between races and genders is unimportant.Philosophical statements on the theme of interconnection and other similar themes are made throughout the movie. These statements often seemed rather profound, but were delivered in a context that made it difficult to absorb in just a few seconds. I need to see this movie again to focus on that. (Or of course I could read the book.) It was a little frustrating not being able to follow it all closely. The movie I saw was (thankfully) subtitled in Dutch, so I was able to follow most of the dialogue.The start of the movie is confusing. It takes a few minutes to understand the structure and the fact that the director wants you to pay attention. It soon fell into place though. There were also a few times when I felt I was being lurched from one story to the next. The didacticism and philosophising of this movie had a downside. Yes, the stories are entertaining, but it's quite clear that grand truths are being preached to the movie goer. But that's what epics do. I'd go see this one.",9,3,6,9 December 2012
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Hot scally lad becomes young James Bond and saves the world
","This is a surprising, fun, fast-paced and rollicking movie that introduces us to a hitherto unknown spy agency called the Kingsmen. This film embodies -- no, cherishes -- the over-the-top aspects of the 1970s Bond films, i.e. the handsome lady-killer spy, the British gentleman ethos, the deadly gadgets, the nifty lairs, the colourful villains out to destroy the world with grand plots, and so on. The movie doesn't honour this legacy subtly or logically. It does so overtly, camply and with relish. Let's not forget the mind-blowing violence, which -- although extreme -- is implied cartoonish movie violence and not difficult to watch at all. Sizzling Taron Egerton is perfect, as is Colin Firth. Even overexposed Samuel Jackson is watchable here. I'd rate the movie 8.5. Prepare to have a great time! As Valentine says at the end 'perfect'!",8,8,19,20 February 2015
The Hangover Part III," Just going through the motions
","I chuckled a few times, but this third film in the Hangover franchise didn't really work for me. It just wasn't as funny or as original as Hangover I and II.It was like everyone involved was just going through the motions, including the writers. They were obviously trying to add more depth to the Alan and Chow characters. At times, it all became too serious, forced, and even awkward. The plot felt contrived.Part of the problem is that there was no hangover this time. I'm sorry, but this franchise sort of requires it.The fun in I and II was partly based on the craziness of Vegas and Bangkok, but here they didn't set the movie in a third crazy city. They just went back to Vegas (via Mexico). OK, they were in Tijuana for a bit, and could have set the craziness there, but for some reason they passed.There were a number of rather phony male bonding scenes in this movie. We are led to think that they are not just idiots who got caught up in stupid antics in Las Vegas and Bangkok; they are now men who -- often and openly -- say in rather strong terms that they are very close friends. ('I love you Alan'.) But at the same time, there were quite a few jokes relating to Alan's and Chow's attraction to men, specifically Alan's man-crush on Phil. The two half-witted girls two rows back were guffawing every time. (I suppose the movie was made for them.) After the third joke, it started to bother me and I became uncomfortable with it. Chow and Alan just became sad figures, in my eyes at least. So many comments about the Wolf Pack bonding with each other, but the gay aspect is held up to ridicule. By the end I felt I was watching the wrong movie.The oafish anti-Semitic joke and animal scenes didn't work for me either. None of it did really. It just wasn't funny.",5,1,2,5 June 2013
Inside Llewyn Davis," Life isn't fair
","OK, I fell sleep before the opening number (a slow folk song) had finished. But I jolted fully awake when this terrific rendition of '500 Miles' was being sung. I realized that I was watching a special film, and now I'm sorry I missed the first 15 minutes and Isaac's initial performance.Oscar Isaac is really terrific in this film. They found an actor who is an excellent folk singer. It's not just that he sings the songs himself, great songs, but it's also his portrayal of the character. I found him and his character engaging. Sure, bad things happen to Llewyn and the people around him, and he alienates people wherever he goes because he's an as$hole at times. But still I was really on his side despite all this. I wanted him to succeed, for others to see what I saw in him, to see how talented he is.This movie reminded me strongly of how much I used to enjoy folk music when I was younger.The rest of the movie was also interesting, everything from its portrayal of American life in the early 1960s to the parade of strange but believable characters that cross Llewyn's path, and especially their dialogue. This intelligent movie has a few profound things to say about 'making it' and fate. It's a good movie for those who believe deep down that life is not fair.There were a number of amazing scenes in the movie, eg the Kennedy song, the injured cat, the Grossman audition, and so on. I suppose this is attributable to incredibly good writing. I've enjoyed all of the Coen brothers' movies, and this is no exception. I need to research why I enjoy their films so much. Very American, but not Hollywood movies.I think the movie is worth about 8.5 and possibly higher, but I'm rounding it down for now because I was uncomfortable with the sudden ending, and I can't say that this movie actually moved me. For me, this movie tickled my intellect more than my heart. I want to see it twice (even though I seldom do that), and perhaps I'll raise the score then.",8,1,2,9 January 2014
The Cabin in the Woods," Original, interesting, not too much gore
","I'm not a fan of the horror genre at all. However, I am a big science fiction fan and I had read enough about this film for it to intrigue me.Yes, there was some gore, but it was relatively bearable. Much of it is shown fleetingly or at a distance. Yes, there are a number of shock surprises in the movie, one aspect of horror films that turns me off. Like in any horror movie, you have to steel yourself for the problem that pretty well anything can happen to anyone at any time. Yes, there are a number of unexplained plot holes large enough to drive a truck through.But despite all that, the movie -- whether accepted at face value or as a metaphor -- was interesting and worked beautifully. I enjoyed this original movie.",8,1,6,12 May 2012
Spectre," Definitely worth seeing
","This is a really good Bond film. It's worth the admission price just for the incredible first 10 minutes. My god, it was one of the most amazing openings for a film ever.This film has all the traditional Bond themes, but presents them in a modern, new way. I think that's exactly what many moviegoers want from a Bond film: a cool spy, beautiful women, exotic locales, cool cars, nifty spy gadgets, shootouts, chases, a ruthless mastermind villain, a criminal organisation, a sophisticated lair, a Bond torture scene, a damsel in distress scene, and so on.I'm really into none of these things but even I found the movie entertaining.",8,1,5,13 November 2015
Hacksaw Ridge," 'My way to serve'
","This movie is the story of Desmond Doss, an American army medic who was a hero at the battle of Okinawa. This enjoyable, profound and well-crafted movie not only tells a great story, but also has important life lessons about war, courage, sacrifice,leadership, character and conviction.We should be grateful that a movie like this can still be made in 2016. That there are still writers, directors and producers able and willing to do this. We're no longer used to going to films that hold out characters as role models. Yes, there is a religious element to it. But I'm not religious at all, and I felt the religious aspects of this were sensitively handled and not too overt. I don't think it's inappropriate to be reminded now and again that we were once in a life-and-death struggle with some of our current allies. It is shocking now to see the intensity of it in one realistic battle scene after the other. Tempora mutantur, nos et mutamur in illis What I didn't like about this film: (1) The recruit training scenes were not 100% realistic to me. (2) The director made it seem like Doss's c.o. status was unusual and affront to his officers, but of course they must have had a system for dealing with this not uncommon situation. (3) The battlefield carnage may be too realistic to some. (4) The Japanese side was not developed in any way, and I think they were almost caricaturized.If you have children who can handle battlefield carnage, take them to see this inspiring film. Are there still young people of conviction out there? Is Mel Gibson's Desmond Doss a realistic role model for our jaded times? I think Andrew Garfield played the role well, and is someone that young people can identify with today. I'm sure some people are going to be uncomfortable with seeing a movie like this made by a director who is wrongly perceived as a dumb*ss beefcake actor and as conservative, ultra-religious and racist. And yet regardless of what you believe about Gibson, there is no doubt that the man is a gifted craftsman. He is a great director who makes mind-blowing movies.",9,4,8,27 December 2016
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," First half is pretty good
","This film is a pretty good ride. Since it's rated as one of the top 100 movies of all time, you'd be crazy not to see it. It has all the hallmarks of an IJ thriller, including the great main character (apparently rated as one of the greatest characters in movie history), the fast-paced plot, the great music, the archaeological discoveries, and so on.However, 'Last Crusade' was the third in the IJ series, so it just didn't seem that fun or original anymore. OK, the first half was pretty good, but it got bogged down in the second half. I had this impression when it was first released; reviewing it again recently just confirmed that for me.I think it's worth about 7.5 but I'm going to round it up to 8.",8,0,2,27 April 2015
Back to the Future," Marty McFly goes back in time
","I want to add my voice to the many who have reviewed this 1985 classic positively. It's a simple and fun movie with a wild and far-fetched story. Marty McFly, with the aid of his mad scientist friend, is able to travel 30 years into the past, where he meets his parents when they were his age. He both prevents history from being changed and yet changes it for the better. A lot of the laughs comes from comparing the town in 1955 and 1985. The film has fully fleshed out characters and a heart-warming, satisfying feel. It's hard to forget how popular this film was when it was released. This movie has withstood the test of time because it can certainly be enjoyed 30 years later.",8,4,5,20 February 2015
The Great Gatsby," Beautiful recreation of an American classic
","This is a beautifully shot film from beginning to end.The music (mostly modern) and party scenes were both excellent. The movie brings New York City of the 1920s to life. It is worth seeing for this aspect alone.It was a pleasure to experience this retelling of the story. I have to admit that it's been over three decades since I read the book, so I enjoyed becoming reacquainted with it.I'm hardly in a position to assess whether the movie agrees with the book in every detail. I don't think it matters. However, the movie does seem true to the spirit of the book.I liked the way the filmmakers honoured FSF's beautiful and profound prose. They didn't have to do that, and they don't do it with most movies based on great fiction. I thought this aspect was integrated beautifully into the film.The acting in the movie is excellent, especially Di Caprio's Gatsby. This man has developed into a great actor and a fine movie star. It's to his credit that he can carry a movie like this. (Indeed, who else could have played Gatsby?) The relationship dynamics between Gatsby, Daisy, Tom and Nick (as shown in the movie) worked completely for me. Nick's fascination, Tom's arrogance, hypocrisy and repulsiveness, Daisy's confusion and turmoil, and of course Gatsby's lovesick despair. The performers delivered all of it.On the downside, I wasn't particularly moved by the movie -- and I am easily moved. (One exception was the electrifying scene where Gatsby meets Daisy again.) Some iffy aspects of the movie's plot, character development and dialogue are actually more attributable to the original book than anything else. If anything Luhrmann may have stayed too close to the original novel.A few aspects are stylized (i.e. not quite realistically portrayed), but this did not ruin the movie for me.In making this fine movie, Luhrmann et al. have done justice to FSF's American classic.I hasten to add that you will enjoy the film even if you haven't read the book, and even if the thought of going to a film based on a work of literature seems boring to you. It isn't a boring movie at all.",9,1,2,26 May 2013
Sully," Quiet movie about Flight 1549 and its pilot
","The heart of this movie is the spectacle -- beautifully staged and filmed -- of a passenger airplane landing on a river in the middle of a large city in the winter and all its passengers getting rescued. By anyone's standards, this is remarkable thing and the worthy subject of a 96-minute movie. Realizing this, Eastwood presents a realistic, appropriate and detailed film depiction of the crash. It was fascinating to watch, even though the viewer already knows how it ends.The rest of the movie is a populist 'little guy v. the man' kind of film, with the airline, the investigating committee and the insurers cast in the role of 'the man', and the pilot (Tom Hanks) and co-pilot (Aaron Eckhart) in the role of the 'little guy'. In the end, the heroism is not just in landing the plane, but in being able to face with dignity and confidence the bureaucratic/financial firestorm that comes afterwards .Hanks and Eastwood also engage in a sort of 'portrait of heroism'. They show us more about Sully and what kind of man he is. The pilot was just a man doing his job, but he did it well and he survived (in many ways) a life-changing accident that could have destroyed him. Is he a genuine hero? This movie makes that argument. America needs heroes; the movie industry loves making films about heroes. The movie was restrained in its flag-waving, thankfully.I thought this was a good film, although maybe a little on the pensive side. It's worth about 7.5, but I'll round it up.",8,0,0,26 June 2017
Jurassic Park," The 3D version is good
","Wow, has it been 20 years since this movie was first released?? I can report that they've done a pretty good job with the 3D version. It was a pleasure to see this classic again, although it is starting to show its age a little. (The grand scene of the grazing dinosaurs that blew me away in 1993 no longer seemed so thrilling. We've seen cinematographers do so much more since then. And it seems almost quaint to see characters who are unable to contact each other by smartphones.) However, the dinosaurs are as lifelike and scary as ever. This time around I noticed some of the things I might have missed when I first saw the film: Neill's handsome smile; Dern's warmth and prettiness; the fine performances by Wayne Knight and Jeff Goldblum. And I had failed to notice the involvement of Richard Attenborough and a very young BD Wong.",8,2,5,19 May 2013
Alien: Covenant," Visually appealing but there are too many issues
","The space ship and the alien world are portrayed beautifully in this movie. In that sense it's a beautiful movie. I wish Ridley would explore this further outside of the Aliens franchise.The 'aliens bursting out of the body' theme -- the hallmark of this franchise, I suppose -- was done well in one spectacular scene. If you enjoy that kind of visceral, Cronenburg-esque horror, you won't be disappointed.Let me list the obvious problems....One problem is that the visuals are not that different from Prometheus. This movie is quite similar to Prometheus.A second problem is that there is no real intellectually interesting premise behind it all. No new story really. No character development at all this time, which is a huge problem. I don't like this special historical connection the aliens somehow have now with the human race via the Engineers. These Engineers. Who are they again?'Alien bursts out of body. Alien becomes scary and evil. Woman fights alien.' This is the plot of every movie. I'm tired of these aliens. A third, very annoying problem is that all the crew seem to be paired off with each other. This movie is proof that partnered people should not be in a military unit together, because if this movie is any indication, the minute one's partner is endangered or gets killed the screaming and blubbering and unprofessionalism begins. 'Oh my god, my wife might be in trouble, I will risk this huge space ship, and all 2000 colonists, just to save her. She's so important.'My response was: WTF is your wife/husband/partner doing on the ship with you if you're such an emotional mess? At one point, I yelled 'stop screaming' aloud at the screen. This is why there are (or should be) rules about this kind of thing. Somehow the edginess of the marines in the first movie has morphed into this. I don't like it.A fourth problem, perhaps the most annoying problem of all, is that these people seem to have no understanding of the biological dangers of alien planets. I mean, a 10-year-old would know about this from watching cartoons. Why don't they? Why would you get so close to a man who was clearly suffering from some serious alien trauma? Why would you look into an alien pod knowing that the alien planet had somehow infected your mates? How can I rate a movie highly when I was spending much of it rolling my eyes?A fifth problem is that the David/Walter mix up was so frigging obvious. I saw it immediately. How could the crew not have checked this more carefully? It was just unbelievable that they didn't do this. And how did David learn Walter's codes? A sixth problem: the movie was confusing. I googled it afterwards to try to sort it out, but I still don't know how the alien got onto the colonist ship after all that effort to keep it out. I suppose David brought it in, but how? In his mouth? And what happened exactly when David brought the ship to this alien world. Where did he get those spores? What were they? Confusing.",6,45,79,1 June 2017
The Martian," Robinson Crusoe on Mars
","This is a sci-fi movie set in the near future. The Aries III Mars mission goes wrong, and an astronaut is stuck on Mars alone for years. The movie tells the story of his survival and rescue.Despite its space theme, it's an old-fashioned, American kind of movie, with the emphasis on heroism, self-reliance and knowhow. It's a big epic that presents in full glory what a Mars mission might be like. This movie is a paean to America's manned space missions, and will appeal enormously to those who believe in American's manifest destiny. Balanced against the heroism of the astronaut is the geekiness of the tech guys back at mission control. In some ways, this movie is really about them. A major theme of the movie is the straight-up belief in the virtue of science and technology.Matt Damon is the competent, engaging, masculine heart of the movie. Because of the subject matter, he is in almost every scene. Fortunately he is still watchable as hell. He does a great job here, especially near the end. He's just a great actor.I'd give this movie a 9, except for one point: it got slow for a bit. This movie is relentlessly realistic. It's almost like watching a documentary. Having said that, I was deeply moved at times.Kudos to Scott, Damon et al. for making such a great movie.",8,2,15,6 October 2015
The Island," Save the clones!
","Part of this movie is a cool science-fiction story about a huge, elaborate, high-tech clone colony in the future run by a corporation that harvests these clones for their body parts. The clones believe they are the remnants of the human race, and that they will eventually be relocated to the last habitable spot on earth: a paradise called the 'the island'. This is a rigidly controlled world where the clones are kept happy and dumb. The corporation has a huge secret: no one knows that these clones, by medical necessity, have had to be allowed to develop sentience. This part of the movie was pretty good.Two of the clones escape, and the director of this project must stop them at all costs from revealing the secret. This part of the movie (almost half?) didn't appeal to me so much because it consisted of chase scenes and shoot-outs, the two staples of every Hollywood movie. Yes, it was fast-paced and competently done, but it was still very tedious to watch.To buy this part of the movie, you have to believe that the staff at this facility are all fanatics capable of keeping a secret, and that the security guards will do absolutely everything and anything to fulfil their orders, much more than even highly trained soldiers would do: relentlessly pursue their prey, drive recklessly, shoot wildly through populated cities, kill innocent people, destroy buildings, ruin expensive vehicles, and even die for their orders. I'm sorry but at one point I realized it was no longer about the plot and believability, but just about cars and guns and selling seats. Yuck. I try to avoid movies like this and I can only drop my score because of it. I have to drop it a full point for this.The movie felt noble and principled, but what was the point really. Save the clones? Don't f*ck with mother nature? Treat everyone with dignity? Liberty for all? This aspect is not clear really. I can't stand behind it.Having said this, I must say it was all entertaining and well done. It's an intelligent, well written movie, but with a good dose of action. Worth seeing if you can sit through 45 minutes of chasing and shooting.",7,0,0,26 February 2015
