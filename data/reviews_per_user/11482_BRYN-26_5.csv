Blade Runner 2049," If a roulette wheel spins in a forest, without a ball, does it make a sound?
","Sadly the answer is yes. It makes the sound a of ball whizzing around. This one bad sound effect broke my immersion. I guess the good part of this is that I was immersed and enjoying the movie, overall it was pretty good. Pretty good that is for a movie that didn't need making!The only other big negative for me was when K meets the resistance and they all come out of the shadows standing behind their leader, how many times have we seen this cliched scene?Putting aside the fact that I didn't think a sequel should have been made then this was a pretty decent effort. I was very please it wasn't another brainless Transformers movie, I loved the slow pacing. The movie was beautiful and did a great job of fitting in with and building upon the original.",7,0,2,18 March 2018
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Vader makes a choke!
","Vader makes a choke!Hi All, remember the good ol' days when Vader was scary? When his every word sent terror through your bones? Where his every gesture and nuance conjured fear and menace? Well fret no longer! Vader is back, but this time he has a comedy hunch-back and is cracking jokes!! He is even seen relaxing in his hot-tub before starting his day's work.So, Darth was terrible. What did I like? Answer, potassium sulfate, the killer robot! K2SO4 WD40, to give it its full droid name.Here's a great killer robot line from another movie:'I think it would be better, not to die, don't you?'Sonny, the title robot from iRobot had a great killer robot voice, almost on par with the killer robot daddy, Hal. So, in their wisdom the Disney execs decided 'hey, Alan Tudyk was a great killer robot in iRobot, why don't we reprise his role to the letter in Rouge One?' (execs all nod approval). Now, for me, K2SO4 was the best character in the film, had the best acting (metallic!), the best lines, AND, the best voice! It was just a shame that he was already a robot from a different movie!!!!!Real 3D, or Real (Painful) 3D.., for it was for me. Painful in my head (by the end of the movie, literally) and painful to my eyes, who watched with cardboard-ian disbelief. Things seems either flat, or blurred, or best of all, both. The best (worst) example being the opening 'A Long Time Ago..', mostly everybody in the theatre were messing with their specs at this point! There were a few bits when I thought 'cool!', but mostly I was left wondering if everybody else in the auditorium were seeing the same flat, dark, silhouettes that I was seeing. It really was a struggle to watch, so much so that intend to watch the movie again to see the bits I missed! (I think the movie may have been quite picturesque in 2D.., certainly there were tropical beaches and palm trees towards the end..)Battlefield 1, yes, the EA WW-1 game. This was advertised at the start of the movie. It almost could have segued seamlessly into the movie itself, in fact it might well have done. Watching the tropical beach battle I was very much reminded of playing Battlefield (Wake Island). Perhaps war is like a computer game? Or perhaps Battlefield is a really good war simulator? Or perhaps pitching the final battle on a tropical beach resort was the cause of my confusion?And then it ended. And the John Williams score started. That was the best bit.",5,9,16,21 December 2016
Interstellar," In Space No One Can Hear You Yawn
","Originality: This movie was completely original, in the exact same way that the Hunger Games was, that is, not at all. The Hunger Games is to Battle Royale as Interstellar is to 2001: A Space Odyssey, that is, a complete rip off. Many reviews are saying how original it is, I expect these people haven't seen 2001.Score: A few people have drawn parallels with Contact, saying that the movie reminds them of Contact. Perhaps it is the pulsating metallic base throbbing noise that Interstellar ripped off?Millennium Falcon: When our heroes first take off from Earth they do so in a Saturn V type moon rocket, with the exhausted stages falling away behind them. Yet, when they later take off from the extra-solar planets, one with 130% gravity no less, they do so in the conventional Millennium Falcon kind of sci-fi way. It huts my eyes!Southern Drawl: Our hero seemed to of had a stroke for the first half of the movie and had slurry half-awake speech, yet later seemed to recover. Perhaps that's what time-dilation does for you!The Robot: Seriously? I think it was so big and square because it contained two CRT-monitors. If you asked a 10yr old to draw a robot design that would be useful on a space mission, then it would undoubtedly improve on the one in Interstellar. But my biggest gripe was, how did it walk? We have two legs(!), our trailing leg doesn't catch on the floor as it swings forwards as our foot extends, lifting us slightly. The robot in Interstellar walks like a pair of chopsticks (but without the accompanying side to side wobble that would be necessary if you chose such an impractical design).Newton's 3rd Law: Stated correctly, applied incorrectly. If our heroes' spaceship had been launched backwards like a bullet from a gun, then it would have been a cool quip, instead it made him look like an idiot corn farmer.The Best of the Best: Why! Why is Hollywood obsessed with the hero being the best of the best of the best? Couldn't he just have been one of the remaining pilots of average competence? (with a genius daughter and an idiot son).Frozen Yoghurt: At one point the Millennium Falcon Space Shuttle hits a cloud made of frozen yogurt (or was it ice?), so, a cloud hanging in the air made of strawberry yogurt, sounds a bit silly. Presumably, as with Arthur Dent's cup, it was held up by art?Emotional: But not a black hole. Possibly the best element of the movie. The human element, and the pain of loss and separation was, strangely, conveyed extremely well.A real Black Hole: Well, I wish I had one so I could get the 3 hours back that I lost watching this. It's not all bad, some bits are compelling, but mostly it's a boring re-skin of 2001.",3,29,61,9 November 2014
Prometheus," Another Alien movie that shouldn't have been made.
","The more I contemplate Prometheus the worse it seems! While certain elements of it were brilliant & very entertaining it was effectively just another Alien movie that shouldn't have been made.Highlights: the space scenes in 3D, the spaceship interior (opulent in Culture-esque way).Here are a couple of flaws (among very many): 1. on the Isle of Skye, upon discovering the drawings the archaeologist runs out of the cave calling 'Dr Holloway, Dr Holloway, come quickly..', this was doubly annoying, firstly no Brit calls another PhD 'Dr' (only in America), secondly, it was so clichéd, it was like watching Stargate (which I hate).2. I thought the crew of the Prometheus was terribly cast, so stereotyped, only Theron was well cast, but her character fell apart half way through. Other characters: 'Let's have a black captain!', but where was his cigar? 'let's have an oriental navigator', Mr Sulu anyone... I could go on!! My rating: 5/10.",1,8,15,15 June 2012
The Martian," Could have been a classic
","The book The Martian is essentially a journal, making a movie of such a book is often very difficult, however, in this respect the movies succeeds, almost admirably. It does cut out a fair bit of the story, but not too much and the movies follows the narrative of the book quite closely. Having really enjoyed the book (apart from the ending – more on that later) I was keen to see the movie, mainly for the Mars vistas and for the spaceships. I was not disappointed, these two elements were simply stunning, and it is worth watching the movie for these elements alone. As mentioned, the story is conveyed well and the acting is on the whole good (with the exception of one atrociously bad character – more on that later), Mat Damon is as watchable as ever.So, why isn't this movie a classic? In some places it comes very close. The obvious comparison is Apollo 13, in terms of story and visuals. And it is against this yardstick that the movie fails. In fact there is really only one failure, but it is such a big one in a space movie that I just can't let it go. In Apollo 13 (1995) the zero gravity environment (floating astronauts in the spaceship) is done perfectly. In The Martian, using CGI that's had 21yrs to improve upon Apollo 13, it fails miserably and painfully. In some shots I could see (almost literally) the harness and the guiderails upon which the actors were clearly whizzing along, this was almost forgivable, but then after floating badly along a corridor the astronaut transitioned to the rotating section of the spaceship whereupon they were 'sucked by gravity' (presumably this was the idea) into the corridor at 90 degrees to their original direction of motion. This was painful on the eye (as gravity due to rotation doesn't work like that), but to make matters worse they showed the same transition twice, as if they were proud of this effect! This one scene (or one scene twice) ruined the movie for the same reason that George Clooney's 'falling away from the spaceship after letting go of the strap' did in Gravity. In a space movie these things are fundamental, when they are wrong we are taken from the moment and left wondering who the much vaunted 'scientific advisors' are?It is a shame to focus on the negatives, but here are two more. Firstly, the character of Rich Purnell played by Donald Glover. I don't think this was Donald Glover's fault, I expect he played him as directed. The character was an abomination! We have seen the same 'nerdy clumsy forgetful insightful bumbling' scientist character over and over again in Hollywood movies, and here he is, back again. This particular variant could have been lifted wholesale from Terminator 2, he was the guy in the computer lab, 'Mr Dyson.., er, Mr Dyson..' (drops coffee, drops pencil, trips up..) 'Mr Dyson..'. Did I mention that Rich Purnell drops his coffee? Then trips up getting more coffee (think Jeff Goldblum here if you like). He eventually makes it back to his computer where he has dinosaurs along the top of the screen 'vegisaurus Lex, vegisaurus' (sorry, different movie). Because all physics nerds are naturally also anthropologists.Okay, nearly the end of the moaning (did I mention that the movie is actually pretty good! – more on that to finish). The second let down is the ending, which is sadly also in the book. Apart from a few Hollywood adjustments the ending of the movie is the same as the book, which is a shame, as it's rubbish. Here I think Andy Weir deliberately wrote a 'Hollywood ending' with the eventual movie firmly in his mind. He would have been better off just focusing on the rendezvous (without the bomb malarkey) as that would have been exciting enough. Instead it was clearly a case of how can we make something that's already nerve bitingly exciting and enthralling even better? With fireworks! Yey! No!! This lets the book and the movie down. This is a Transformers finale in a 2001-esqu movie, painful and unnecessary.To finish on a high, or on a song, there are good songs in the movie! I would recommend the movie, apart from the gripes (above) the movie is well made and the visuals are simply stunning. I look forward to the day when what is portrayed in the movie is made real, it all looks plausible! C'mon NASA!",7,0,0,31 July 2016
