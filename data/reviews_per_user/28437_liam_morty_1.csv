The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," *Yawn* I don't even care what happens next anymore
","Very rarely do I agree with the majority however in this case anyone who calls this film a 'triumph of cinema' or 'fantastic film' needs a slap. $250 million budget across Part 1 and 2, Part 1 having been made (I can only assume) with say $30 million of that. So I now expect Part 2 to have over $200 million worth of quality. I may not even watch Part 2, like I said in the title I have almost completely lost interest in the franchise due to this film being so utterly boring that only the cringing from Lawrence's overacting stopped me from falling asleep in the cinema. The entire film centered around Katniss' transformation into the Mockingjay (something that whether you've read the books or not, KNOW is going to happen) So to make it a 2 1/2 hour ordeal is just offensive to the viewer. Two and a half hours of Lawrence whimpering (Like the leader of a rebellion should?) I'd rather watch Two and a Half Men.",5,22,33,23 November 2014
