The Devil's Advocate," Could have been MUCH better.
","*** SPOILERS AHEAD ***The Devils Advocate is, basically, a very good idea gone wrong. The whole thing about casting Pacino as a devil -ish businessman is very interesting, and the movie could have been great if it tried to be a tense psychological drama; rather, the movie basically failed to think about its direction. There was an attempt at psychological drama played on Keanu Reeves' side, but it basically got completely lost in cheap attempts at horror effects (devil faces becoming visible) and gratuitous violence that, instead of being relevant to the plot, failed to stay connected to the main theme. As a matter of fact in the end there's an attempt at connecting the rather disjointed events by using a 'vision' thing. However this trick seems rather inappropriate and, if anything, made the movie even cheaper.Pacino is great, and delivers here one of his best performances ever. Charismatic and scary at the same time in his raspy, deep voice, he is definitely what saved the movie from being an utter failure.On the other side, Keanu Reeves is worse than usual (that being already not an easy task). It seems almost laughable that such an un-charismatic character and weak spokesman could be such a good lawyer. I'm not even sure if Reeves tried to sound southern American, but his performance comes out downright laughable. There's a scene in the movie where he's supposed to be crying in desperation but his attempt at that was so awful I almost burst out laughing. I felt he was a very odd choice for this kind of character, especially because he was supposed to be the character that we should identify with or at least care for. I did neither.There's actually, an extremely good and gripping part in the movie, that being the 10 minutes before our fellow advocate meets the devil after discovering his true identity. Gripping and tense. But what happens after... nothing... the whole tension deflates miserably... too bad.As I said... it could have been great, but it wasn't that good...6/10",6,0,2,22 March 2001
Fight Club," Some thoughts...
","*SPOILERS AHEAD*Ok, I don't want to tell people what they should think and what they shouldn't, but I have to say it. There... about the twist in Fight Club, there's something that a previous user (as well as some other users) are obviously missing.There are numerous hints that become apparent after a couple of viewings which suggest that the narrator only partially acts out as Tyler. One of the scenes is the one with Raymond K. Hassel, the clerk that he threatens with a gun. Rewatching that scene, a couple of things become clear:a) There are blurred boundaries between 'when' Tyler actually talks and when Tyler's talking is just an illusion in the narrator's mind. Raymond answers some questions, yet a couple of times the narrator has to do the talking for Tyler, as apparently Raymond didn't hear what Tyler just said. What does that tell us? That in these small fragments the narrator failed to bring out Tyler. In other words, in these small fragments Tyler wasn't 'acted out' by the narrator. When they are alone (they practically never talk to each other in public), the narrator is having a conversation with himself in his mind, but he's not speaking out loud, as he doesn't need to act out Tyler.b) The same is true for the scene in the car. There are fragments where Tyler speaks out loud on behalf of the narrator, but again, the boundaries are not defined, since the whole film is the subjective view of a man suffering from 'dissociative' psychosis: the narrator ONLY partially acts out as Tyler. This is not just to justify why the space monkeys in the back answer Tyler's question. Fincher, I believe (and I've been watching the movie a lot, to see if there are flaws on this) paid particular attention to this, and it came out well. In fact, the whole conversation that the narrator and Tyler have in the car is just an illusion in the narrator's head, as he's not speaking out loud except in a couple of fragments. The couple of fragments where he's speaking out loud are, apparently, where emotions are prevailing (the narrator screaming 'I wanna know certain things first'): the 'wall' that he has built in his subconscious to permit him not to 'act out' the two personalities is torn down for a small fragment of time. When one of the two personalities is specifically addressing questions to an external person, of course, he doesn't need this 'wall', so he can act out one of the two personalities.Another thing... Fight Club doesn't attempt to give answers to the question it raises; in particular, doesn't portray the fight club, Project Mayhem and Tyler himself as the underlying philosophy that one should follow. This becomes more and more obvious through the movie, the final twist being the ultimate proof of the irrationality of these solutions. Sorry, but it bothers me a little that one refuses the validity on the twist on the whole and then blames the movie for being 'empty'.I say that the movie righfully does not offer solutions (there's only a brief hint in the end about *love*): let's face it, no matter how long, a movie can not support the weight of such heavy questions as the role of society and the equilibrium of the human in it. But the movie addresses heavy criticism about what consumerism portrays as 'happiness'. I say -- in this, Fight Club succeeds in spades.",10,4,9,2 January 2002
Fight Club," Excellent
","Dealing with our society's faults is not easy task. This movie does it perfectly and, most important, is not pretentious enough to give answers and teach people what to do about it. Many questions whose answers are left to the viewer arise through this film. Is Tyler Durden really crazy? Was the fight club just a product of the narrator's increasing paranoia or rather a cure to his frustrations (or both?). Were the people in project Mayhem finding their real ego or were they just followers? Is the world we see really what we think it is, and are we actually who we think we are? Is it possible to change the world, and how far can we go to change it?Paid critics trashed this movie. Those reviews - some of which were so empty they were laughable - were exactly part of the system this movie wants to criticize, and therefore came out like actual glorification. Those same critics believed that Pulp Fiction dealt with the pornography of violence (strangely enough I never found any other movie where killers were so 'cool'). Or they strongly believed that the light-hearted American Beauty dealt with our society's real faults ('...there's so much beauty in the world'... yeah, I'd like to see what people in Mexico City's surroundings think about that).Fight Club is a violent movie, but violence is not mindless and it's not seen as 'cool'. It's simply a projection of one man's frustration with a system whose surface covers emptiness and lies. This man (let's call him 'the narrator') has a job, nice house, and a decent amount of money. But in his subconsciousness he realizes that a consumeristic life will never tame his awareness that much in the world is wrong and he's not doing anything to change it. Physically, he is suffering from insomnia but inside he knows - because he is part of that system itself - that he's been keeping his eyes shut for years. As a consequence, he simply tries everything that would make him feel far away from being part of the world he knows. He starts going to cancer support groups and this makes him feel better - dying people show more humanity than anybody he's acquainted with, and being next to death sort of makes him feel numb. Eventually, a woman without any disease - like him - shows up and that's when he realizes he's hiding, rather than fighting. Thus, the beginning of 'Fight Club'...If you've never seen the movie you might think this is a rather depressing or very-intellectually 'boring' film. It's not. There are exceptional graphics and it's very funny, the performances are excellent - especially Edward Norton's. Even Brad Pitt, who I never thought was anything special as an actor, is very impressive here.The movie came out little more than one year ago. Will it be a classic in the next years? Let's see. As for my take, it's quite possibly the best movie or the 90's.",10,0,1,30 January 2001
Memento," Forget the hyped sequel with brains but without any real brain - Memento is the thriller you should see!
","Memento is one of the best debuts that I'm aware of, and a remarkable achievement for a relatively low-budget film. Once again, in a film industry that too often forgets that only hype doesn't make a good movie, it's nice to see that some director has the courage to try something different, something that might not make a huge commercial success but will feel fresh when the big names will feel tiresome and dated.The technique of starting the movie near the end, then flashing back, then back again was recently used in Fight Club, but Memento takes it to a whole new level. Although the film does remind of Fincher's violent satire at times, including for the use of a visual twist, it is clearly no clone. Where Fight Club is psycho-political bite, Memento is full paranoia through an extremely complicated yet gripping storyline that requires tremendous attention to the details. I won't give much of the plot away; it suffice to say that the movie explores the psychological sphere of a man looking for someone who did wrong to his family. Only problem, he suffered major damage in the event and can't make any new memories. How can he find who's looking for? Can he trust the people around him? And can he really trust his own data? Not only Memento will surprise you, confuse you, and even make you smile, but will raise questions about the true nature of our mind, about time, and about how we judge people.In a year that saw Russell Crowe's name in every magazine, Guy Pearce proves he's definitely worth the same attention. His strong performance puts him in the league of young, talented actors with an already incredible career... Benicio Del Toro, Edward Norton, Guy Pearce...So far I've seen the movie only once but I won't forget to see again!",9,0,1,24 April 2001
The Fifth Element," Laughable (at best)
","Call me stupid, but I can't really get into a movie like this one. It's so predictable, fake, ridiculous that I struggle to believe someone actually liked it.Of course, the fifth element is (guess what!!!) love, the star has a really sad past, the enemies (some really bad and dumb aliens) wanna destroy the world, etc. People get murdered everywhere during the so-called 'fights' (of course, the 'star' character could shot 20 of them without even being hit, and that says it all about how this movie cares about characters' role), but nobody cares as, the movie implies, they 'are not important'.Wow, that's love, sure.Protect the innocent before killing the guilty. That would mean something about what love really is.BTW, the final scene is even more pathetic than the rest of the movie.2/10",2,5,13,21 January 1999
The Beach," Spoiled brats on vacation
","What a disappointment. Danny Boyle had recently directed one of my favorite films of the last few years, Trainspotting, and although Leonardo DiCaprio has never been between the actors I liked, I had somewhat high expectations for The Beach. It turned out that DiCaprio's acting is actually the best thing about this clunker.To say that The Beach didn't have the space to develop its ideas would be wrong. The movie is based on a book by Alex Garland, and while I never read the book, I must say that the concept the movie seems based on could be interesting. The search for a new way of living outside our society and considerations on the impossibility to find the perfect Paradise on Earth are captivating, and as a nature lover I must say that it is really rare that pro-ecology undertones don't appeal me. However, these themes were treated in such a vapid, superficial and often hypocritical way in The Beach that when the movie was over I was not just bored, I was irritated.I am not blaming the author of the book. In fact, it could be that the novel is a good read. But if the movie is a good adaptation of it, then I am sure I will skip on the book for the rest of my life.The Beach opens in Bangkok; Richard (Leonardo DiCaprio), a young American man, is here on vacation. In the hotel he meets Daffy (Robert Carlyle), a dope-smoking lunatic who shows him the map to an island where, it seems, it's possible to find the most beautiful place on Earth. Richard doesn't pay much attention to him, but when the next morning he finds that Daffy had killed himself, he steals the map and wonders if this beach really exists. Finally he decides to take a chance and, along with a young French couple, he takes a trip to the fabled island.To this point, the film is not particularly good, but it is at least interesting. But as soon as the movie gets to the beach, everything starts going downhill and it never stops, reaching the worst with the awful finale.When the three young tourists get to the beach, they get to know that they are not alone. A small village of young men and women already lives here, and although it seems like a disappointment at first (at least judging from DiCaprio's voice-over), when Richard and the French couple get to know them and their way of living, they begin to be very fascinated. The small village, it is said (more on this later), is self-sufficient and they can live without any contact with the outside. The problem is, if anything happens, they are on their own.The movie puts in some romance between the French girl, Françoise (Virginie Ledoyen), and Richard, and some time is spent on the consequent grief of Françoise's boyfriend. The romance however, fails to generate any sparks, and the focus on Françoise's boyfriend anger is shifted off so abruptly he practically disappears from the movie. However, as uninteresting as the romance is, it is not nearly as bad as most of the rest.First of all, there is not one likable character. Most of them are either paper-thin, irritating, spoiled, and usually all things together. There is much talk about how these young people are self-sufficient, and yet we see that they are not: they hardly do anything all day. Richard himself has to go on the outside world to buy goods for the island community, and most of these goods are the typical unnecessary comforts many tourists look for when going on vacation. The people on the island play video games and buy beer; it's never shown where they put their trash. In many scenes the movie looks like a Club Med commercial, and it is a pity since the problems of a small society truly living on its own never get the possibility of being delved into.During the course of the movie, two characters are attacked by a shark. One dies in a brief time, the other is left dying in the woods because, it seems, the island community doesn't want people on the outside to know about them. Deus ex machina anyone? How does 'bringing a man to the hospital' immediately connect to 'revealing where the community is'? And when the members of the community go to play volleyball while their friend is left dying, one would at least expect that it is a starting point to show how they will be unable to cope with their own sense of guilt. It never happens.In a completely different scene, Richard suddenly loses his mind without apparent motivation, and one has to wonder what it is all about. And after some nonsense that leads to the killing of four tourists who reached the island, he snaps perfectly awake again. Absurd.And when Richard finally gets back to 'normal' society, we see him thinking about the island with nostalgia. That's right. Puh-lease.Stylistically, this movie is a huge step back from Trainspotting for Boyle. The music is barely tolerable, the cinematography relies on the beautiful scenery but puts in some inappropriately silly scenes, such as Richard transforming into a video game hero while walking in the forest. The performances, apart from DiCaprio's (pretty good, but not very good) range from average to bad. But what's most disappointing is the treatment of the subject matter. Trainspotting had ideas, characters and story. The Beach has ideas that never get developed, irritating characters, and a story that barely stays together.4/10",4,1,2,7 March 2002
Bridget Jones's Diary," Not bad, but not very good either
","The reason why I was not disappointed about this movie is that I didn't have many expectations. Yes, it's funny in a couple of scenes, but nothing better than your average sex/sentimentality 'chick' flick. I didn't read the book and I still don't think it's one of my priorities but as the story was presented, I wonder who wasn't already prepared to see Bridget disappointed with one guy and switch to the other, only apparently less likeable one. Good acting performances make me slightly raise the rating, but just like many other movies, 'Bridget Jones's Diary' is definitely not worth the hype.6/10",6,0,0,24 April 2001
Predator," Probably my Mr. Schwarzenegger's favourite
","Well, this is a good movie. Nothing really deep, but still good. Maybe I'm biased, as I'm kinda into the 'monsters' thing (well, if they're not dumb stuff... the monsters don't mean anything as long as the stories are dumb). But this ain't a dumb movie, and definitely it's thrilling and well thought. I'd give it a 8 out of 10.",9,0,0,6 February 1999
American Beauty," Pretty good but deeply flawed
","American Beauty tries really hard to be a intense commentary on modern society in the so-called 'civilized world'. The portrait of a disillusioned middle-aged man given by Kevin Spacey is superb and deserved the praise it got. Although his character shows obvious psychological and moral flaws, one could only sympathize for his decision to choose sincerity as a cure to his disillusioned life. Spacey's character, the flawed man that conveys more humanity than anybody else, is nothing new to the cinema industry: think about One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest (which is, anyway, a far superior film) for instance. But while not revolutionary, American Beauty is very well crafted around Spacey, and the rest of the actors give out fairly good performance. On the psychological level, this is a film about comprehension and respect, and a beautiful one.However, on the social level, this film fails miserably. And that's where 'beauty' comes in.Such lines as 'there's so much beauty in the world' and the infamous plastic bag scene are absurd and irritating. There's nothing beautiful in a piece of trash that pollutes our environment, there's not that much beauty in the world anymore considering that we keep destroying it, considering that numerous species of animals seem doomed to extinction, and especially considering that none of the characters in the movie seems to care about it AT ALL. The plastic bag scene would have worked with a bird... or even with a rat, if one wants to find beauty in what most people can't... but with a plastic bag it's just fluffy and hypocritical. Fight Club - another movie that explored the ground of psychological disillusion and flaws in our society - got into a lot controversy about its violence when, in fact, was delivering a much more carefully constructed message about respect for nature and what our society has to avoid.In other words, this movie works in a beautiful way around the human characters, but all it pulls out is a 'enjoy your life' message that ultimately seems, if not in contrast with what the movie was saying in the beginning, very mild and inappropriate anyway.That's why I think this movie is interesting, but not a masterpiece at all. Not even close.6/10",6,0,0,20 April 2001
Apocalypse Now," It'll take you out there.
","Capt. Willard: 'They told me that you had gone... totally insane... and that your methods were unsound.'Col. Kurtz: 'Are my methods unsound?'Capt. Willard: 'I don't see... any methods... at all, sir.'Ah, Apocalypse Now. Probably my favorite war film of all time.Coming from the huge success of The Godfather and The Godfather: Part II, Francis Coppola was offered the possibility to direct a big-budget epic about the Vietnam war. Did I say big-budget and about the Vietnam war? Ok, I have come up with only a couple of statements and there is something to say already. While the planned budget for the film was undoubtedly large, the process of filming it was a true Odyssey; endless problems, including but not limited to a typhoon that destroyed most of the sets, difficulties with the authorities of the Philippines (where the film was shot), and personal problems with the actors and the crew, brought the costs sky high, and the shooting process from the scheduled six weeks up to 16 months. In case you are interested, there is a 1991 documentary titled Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse that is said to narrate the incredible adventure that the making of the film was, and how Coppola himself at the end was almost physically, financially and psychologically devastated. Sadly, I have not been able to see the aforementioned documentary, but it must be definitely worth a look if you are a fan of Coppola or filmmaking in general.While Apocalypse Now's context is strongly related to the Vietnam war, its ambitions are higher and its implications much broader: it is not simply an opera about Vietnam, it is an adventure in human insanity where war is only part of it. Perhaps the most interesting quality of the film is that, far more than any other war movies I have seen, it works perfectly on multiple levels; on a more immediate level, it is a depiction of the struggles, the bad judgments, and the madness of the battlefield. On further analysis, it is a metaphorical, visceral adventure into the depths of the darkest side of the human mind, a trip that's most definitely open to many different interpretations and opinions. Of course, like in every masterpiece, the two layers complement each other perfectly and reflect one another, building a memorable picture of intense emotional power. Simply put, Apocalypse Now successfully goes where other popular war movies such as Saving Private Ryan or Full Metal Jacket fail to go, or more realistically (pun somewhat intended) just don't have the ambition to go.Apocalypse Now liberally adapts Joseph Conrad's novel Heart of Darkness, transplanting it into the chaos of the Vietnam war circa 1969. The main character is Captain Benjamin L. Willard (Martin Sheen) of US Army Intelligence. Willard has already carried out 'assassinations' for the Government and is, his own way, almost a war victim; he is alive, but he feels soulless, and his perspective for a regular life seems lost forever -- especially after the divorce from his wife, which he blames for the greater part on himself. In Saigon, he is handed a mission. Out there in Cambodia, the former outstanding officer Col. Walter E. Kurtz (Marlon Brando) has stopped following the orders and is now conducting his own personal, ferocious war with his own army, who apparently worship him like a god; he is operating 'beyond the pale of any acceptable human conduct' and, as General R. Corman (G.D. Spradlin) informs Willard, his command must be terminated. Kurtz must be terminated. With extreme prejudice. Willard will have to track the Colonel by riding a small boat upriver with a few soldiers, then kill him. A long dossier on Kurtz is handed to Willard so that he'll be able to understand what is going on in Kurtz's mind.Perhaps one of the most memorable characters in Apocalypse Now is William Kilgore (Robert Duvall), the loud-mouthed Colonel whose orders are to transport and escort Willard and his boat crew for a brief period. Kilgore is just about the complete opposite of Kurtz, but he is almost as scary. The famous sequence where he orders to play Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries during an air raid is without a doubt an immortal piece of cinema, and the same can be said about his infamous quote, 'I love the smell of napalm in the morning... It smells like... victory.'Speaking of memorable scenes, there are so many that I just don't know where to begin; the film is visually a real tour de force. The opening, with The Door's 'The End' playing while we are witnessing the destruction of a portion of jungle, sets the mood with apocalyptic undertones that will only grow stronger as the movie progresses; the near-riot caused by a Playboy show plays like a dream sequence, and seems to underline the progressive detachment from sanity and rational thoughts; the tragic consequences of the boat's crew incompetence in dealing with a simple canoe is a heartbreaking moment where personal regret and the horror of amoral choices come stronger than ever. Probably most riveting of all are the shocking images of an army without commanding officer and completely on the loose in a remote outpost.The pacing is perfect. As we crawl along the river, we experience an ever-deepening spiral into darkness, madness, and seemingly unreal events; the conduction of war is taking wrong turns on all parts and Willard is progressively descending into mental instability. Like Kurtz, Willard is appalled by the incompetence and the horror surrounding him; the boat crew is slowly killed off one by one.Col. Kurtz's compound is, quite literally, the end of the river: the last stage of madness, or the ultimate bowel of hell on Earth. And yet, it is strangely fascinating. Kurtz is part demon, part prophet. He has, quite simply, stopped questioning the morality of his choices and now lives and acts following the rules of the jungle. In many ways, Kurtz represents Willard's inner demon, and the final scene where Willard has to become Kurtz to get rid of him and what he represents is, in my opinion, absolutely outstanding.The acting is excellent on all parts. Martin Sheen's restrained performance perfectly fits the emotionally disrupted Capt. Willard, and his voice-over does not feel obtrusive or grow boring. Marlon Brando is great as the man whose soul has hit rock bottom, Kurtz, and Robert Duvall offers what is possibly his best performance to date (ok, together with The Godfather). The supporting cast (that includes Frederic Forrest, Dennis Hopper, Laurence Fishburne, Harrison Ford, and Sam Bottoms) never fails.One particular mention goes to the soundtrack. The mix of rock tunes and atmospheric sounds works in a magnificent way creating a mix of real/surreal that's been rarely matched in the history of cinema.",10,1,2,4 May 2002
The Patriot," Astonishingly bad movie
","'THIS MOVIE SUCKS!'At first I thought it might have been appropriate to repeat this sentence 333 times to fill in the 1000 words for a review. Something stupid over and over again, like this movie goes on over and over again with the same thing. How many times are we supposed to look at wars only 'seen on from the good side' -- of course I hardly believe there's a 'good' or 'bad' side, despite how this movie shamelessly tries to manipulate the viewer. How many times are we supposed to see the villains like maniacs who just wanna slaughter people for apparently no reason at all? The villain of this movie (yeah, basically we are presented with a war that is one character against the other... and that tells it all on how cartoonish and laughable the script is) is not a soldier fighting for his own Country. He is some kind of crazy nut who feels pleasure to kill. And what's up with that scene where Mel Gibson brutally slaughters one of the enemies and keeps ripping apart the dead body? That is one of the most gruesome and worthless scenes I have ever seen in a movie. And don't let me start on the historical mistakes.Absolutely awful. 3/10",3,1,3,7 February 2001
Face_Off," Action, action, action... ok, enough...
","Spoiler Alert Most of the people who like John Woo seem to like him because of his mastery at shooting action scenes. While I am not a conossieur of Woo's cinematic career, after witnessing Mission: Impossible II -- a film that was as big a box office success as it was a debacle in the creativity department -- and the superior Face/Off, I must say that while Woo's talent at putting action onscreen is noteworthy, it seems also his biggest weakness. Under his direction, explosions and stylized cartoon-like violence are sometimes superbly done, sometimes overlong and overblown; but the real problem with Woo's action is when it grows obtrusive and it becomes tedium in a script that should have been tight and tense. Mission: Impossible II was all tedium, and it constantly resorted to slow-mo shootings and explosions to hide the fact that the script was as lame as they come. Face/Off, despite the preposterous premise, has a script that is tight and intense in more than one occasion, but that also goes limp towards the end when more than a few interesting plot points are simply shaken off by action sequences.Sean Archer (John Travolta) is a FBI agent who, during an attempt to stop the notorious master criminal Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage) lost his young son. Archer, a man dedicated to his family and his job, struggles with the pain caused by the loss and is looking forward to finally arrest Troy; six years later the occasion finally comes and, after a sensational airplane chase, Archer captures both Castor Troy's brother Pollux (Alessandro Nivola) and Castor Troy himself who, victim of an accident, is taken to an hospital in an apparently irreversible coma. Buth things are not as easy as they seem.Apparently, a major bomb had been planted somewhere in Los Angeles and the two criminal brothers are the only ones who know where it is located and how to disarm it. But as Pollux -- who does not know about his brother's accident -- refuses to reveal any details unless he can speak to Castor, there is nothing left to do but have Sean Archer himself go through a few cosmetic changes, a little bit of liposuction, and a facial surgery to (gulp!) wear Castor Troy's real face! And what if the real Castor Troy suddenly wakes up and 'wears' Archer's face, so that one looks exactly like the other? Yep, you've guessed it right.I heard a lot of people complaining about how 'unrealistic' and 'unbelievable' the premise is. Well people, get over it. Blaming this film of being unrealistic is like blaming Being John Malkovich of the same thing. I am as picky as the next guy when it comes to implausibility, but there are movies meant to be realism and movies that are not. Suspension of disbelief, and tons of it, is obviously essential for Face/Off.Providing we accept the impossible premise, the film stays for the most part enjoyable, before it eventually goes overboard and becomes a chaotic action overkill. We are provided with a plot, the swap of identities, that has been used a lot of times in cinema and literary works, especially for comedies. Here however, it is used with dramatic efficacy in quite a few scenes, and it delivers some scenes that are emotionally engaging and tense, and that at times even scratch the surface of intellectually challenging material. Not that script is without flaws; the sequence where Sean Archer (now played by Nicolas Cage!) escapes from a maximum security prison, for instance, is quite sloppy and hard to digest. But seeing the two arch-enemies exploring each other's world and trying to cope with it, thereby becoming the other person, is definitely interesting.This also brings me to the bad part of the movie; while Face/Off does not have the ambition of being a 'thought-provoking' or philosophical movie, I simply do not understand the need of shaking off certain plot points through overlong action scenes whose outcome is absolutely predictable. Also, action -- no matter how well shot -- is involving as long as it is used with parsimony; the initial sequence that leads to the arrest of the Troy brothers is perfect, because it stops before getting tiresome. The final hero vs. villain sequence not only is overlong, but it does not feel right: suddenly, everything between the two enemies -- including a hint at emotional attachment to each other's world -- is resolved by a sequence where all the villains die and all the good people stay alive, and where people miss their targets whenever the director feels like we need to see more. It feels as the film is afraid of having become a thriller more than an action movie.The acting by the two leads is fairly good. Neither of them is between my favorite actors, but I enjoyed them much more here than I did in many other movies.Face/Off is both a moderate success and a moderate failure but, despite all its flaws, gets my recommendation. Although I doubt Woo will ever become one of my favorite directors, I must say that this film gave me the impression that he can, indeed, do good things.6/10",6,0,0,26 May 2002
Independence Day," Basic, incoherent and lame sci-fi flick
","'Independence Day' was a hyper-commercialized, predictable, and scientifically inept movie. Sure, it was packed with a load of great images, but frankly I expected even more, since it was supposed to set new levels for special FX (and it did not). But I can put up with that. What makes this a god-awful movie, in my opinion, is the pathetic look at technology we are supposed to go through. I firmly believe that sci-fi movies, as unlikely as they can be, should have decency and SHOULD NOT show downright ignorance -- but then again, how many times are we supposed to be presented with space ships that make noises in empty space? Here we are supposed to learn that aliens whose technology is thousands of years ahead of ours still use floppies, program their computers in our programming languages (despite the fact that they have a completely different alphabet and speech) or in a compatible format anyways, and that we can upload a VIRUS to their HUGE computer when Windows viruses can't affect machines that run a different operating system like Unix here on Earth! Sorry guys, I cannot get into something downright laughable like that. And what's up with that 'America is always the only Country that matters' thing?This movie deserves, IMHO, a 3 out of 10, and ONLY for the special FX, as the acting was very mediocre, too.",3,11,22,26 January 2001
Mission: Impossible II," Easily, one of the worst movies of the year
","Tom Cruise, back at his worst acting standards. I admit he is not one of my favorite actors, and despite the huge efforts that Hollywood made to include him in the big league I still have not seen him delivering a great performance. Certainly his performance in this movie is light-years from being noteworthy. With the help of a tiresome script, he desperately tries to be the 'anti-Bond' cool cat, and the results are pathetic. But he is not even the worst thing in the movie. The storyline is... well, I would say 'predictable' but that is an euphemism. All we get in this movie was seen before in other movies (mostly in average and bad movies, anyway). It is like a collection of the tiresome Hollywood standards for action movies. A futile love story, the usual bad guy that wants to do one of the standard bad things (I won't spoil it... just think of three things the standard bad guy from mediocre action movies would do, and you probably got at least two right). And the final fight... oh dear.Although I've seen much worst stuff around through the years, it's still really depressing to see big budget movies delivering this kind of standard, predictable, futile junk.3/10",3,0,0,12 March 2001
A Clockwork Orange," Some thoughts about A Clockwork Orange
","I have to agree with a previous comment about the detractors of this movie; it seems this is not the right movie for people who just wanna see the classic psycho movie characters and be scared (while laugh at the characters' foolishness inside). This is not that kind of movie; so just watch The Shining (a really good movie, btw) instead of this if that's what you want. ACO isn't, indeed, an easy movie; Stanley Kubrick did a wonderful job in trying to make the audience identify in Alex's character, while keeping Alex's character himself so unbelievably real that sometimes you think Malcolm McDowell was real crazy. That's probably why the movie is psychologically shocking (and no, you don't see that much blood or straight violence on the screen). This is not, indeed, a movie translation of the novel itself: although they share the sharp sense of humour of Alex's narrative, the story is slightly different, and the reader doesn't identify with 'the novel's Alex' that much; as Burgess himself said, the movie is 'Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange', the book is 'Anthony Burgess' a Clockwork Orange'. I'd say their aim was pretty different: Burgess' primary one was probably to describe society dehumanization, Kubrick wanted to show how criminals aren't 'aliens' and sometimes respectable people aren't better than them. This is, probably, why the movie was dubbed 'disgusting' by so many people. The movie is visually really different from anything else ever appeared on the screen: not at all hollywood-looking (nothing fancy looking here), and maybe that's another reason why the 'anti' camp is still pretty big; nevertheless, I think Kubrick did a wonderful job in describing those 'futurible' suburbs. One final note: the movie described a very close future when it came out; now it's probably more like 'an alternate world', although really close to ours. That's why the movie itself still keeps his scary fascination.10/10",9,2,4,3 May 1999
A Beautiful Mind," Yep, intelligence is a terrible thing to waste...
","'Saccharine' is one of those adjectives that moviegoers use and abuse. I don't consider myself one that abuses it: although I do get irritated when watching phony sentimentality, I do not mind movies that aim for the heart. Honestly, I don't even mind movies that get a little manipulative in this respect, unless of course the manipulation is downright insulting (and sadly, it is not that rare).Now, are you a fan of plot twists? Because I am going to start with one in this review already: forget about the word 'saccharine', because A Beautiful Mind, despite what a few people said, did manage not to insult the viewer's intelligence by inserting too many syrupy scenes. The bad news is, however, that this has brought a denouement about Howard's real capabilities. Quite frankly, he has not matured into the awesome director they want us to see.What's that? You're saying that the aforementioned plot twist was not very good? Well, you will not find much better in the film.A Beautiful Mind tells the fictionalized story of John Nash (Russell Crowe), Noble prize winner who struggled for most of his life with schizophrenia. In the beginning of the film, we meet Nash as a student in Princeton. He is a strange individual, apparently shy and volatile; he often speaks his mind out loud and ends up being ridiculed by students with better social skills. Apparently, Nash is also experiencing troubles with his studies, but he is constantly looking for a revolutionary idea that would permit him to be remembered as an innovator and good mathematician. One day, in a bar where he is putting into mathematics a method to pick up girls, he comes up with a theory so revolutionary that, in the future, the world of economics and beyond will literally be changed by it.Years later, following the success of his theory, Nash is working for a government agency and is a professor at the Massachuttes Institute of Technology; here, he meets Alicia (Jennifer Connelly) and falls in love with her. However, for Nash life is not as easy as it sounds, as soon he -- and the viewers -- will get to learn that part of his world is not quite what he thinks. He is suffering from schizophrenia, and with the progressive degeneration of it both his love life and his work as a mathematician are at risk of being destroyed forever. Will love and genius triumph over tragedy?OK, this last question sounds a little overdone and goofy, but it is not so dissimilar from level of depth that A Beautiful Mind maintains through the film. The problem with A Beautiful Mind is not so much that the film takes liberties with John Nash's story, but rather that these liberties are the result of poor presentation and weak ideas.I have never read in its entirety the book that tells the real (not fictionalized) story of John Nash, but I am aware that the nature of some of his hallucinations is not played the way it is played in the film; the clear boundaries between reality and delusions are suppressed in the film to surprise the viewer with a plot twist. Fine, I am a fan of plot twists when they add something in terms of significance, but here it is clearly done only for entertainment value. The same can be said about many events in Nash's real life that in the movie are skipped, distorted or changed. It is clear that the aim of A Beautiful Mind is not to change a true story in order to explore the mind of a troubled genius, but rather to present a product as clean and accessible to the public as possible. And while this has apparently guaranteed big cash and the Academy consideration, it didn't fool me. You see, Howard's Cocoon did not have ambitions to be much more than a fairy tale, and on that level it was perfectly enjoyable. A Beautiful Mind is not a fairy tale, and I think we should expect a little more than a story where everything is on the surface.I am not condemning the fact that A Beautiful Mind took a true story and fictionalized it, but rather the fact that it did not do so to add levels of depth to it; it did so to make it the most commercially palatable. Symbolism, psychical discourses, and mathematics are pretty much completely absent, and the glimpses of Nash's genius are put on screen through 'romanticized', computer-generated visual effects; anything that could have possibly disturbed the public has been removed. I am quite positive that even a documentary-like approach to John Nash's story would have given more insight about the human mind and more though-provoking material. A Beautiful Mind is not a terrible motion picture, it is a terribly average motion picture, one that would have satisfied me if it was a made-for-TV production.The acting is satisfying. Crowe, who inexplicably won last year for his mediocre portrayal of Maximus in Gladiator, is up for another Oscar this year. His work here is certainly good, but not great. Jennifer Connelly has been better before, but she is equally satisfying.Sadly, A Beautiful Mind cannot be recommended, and the fact that it was nominated for multiple Academy Awards probably puts a final word about the real meaning I give to the Oscars.6/10",6,0,1,17 March 2002
Gladiator," Too flawed to be considered a great film
","WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEADThis is a pretty good film, but certainly not worth being considered a serious candidate for 'best picture of the year' (sadly, the people at the Oscars are probably gonna think different). The reason for my statement is simple: although the visuals are excellent and there are some really strong points through the whole movie, the script is pretty simplistic, and is inaccurate as a portrait of the ancient Roman empire.Also, I have a big problem with Ridley Scott's depiction of 'evil' and 'good' characters. Apart from Blade Runner, he always insists too much on how the bad guy is evil, and how the good guy is the voice of reason and freedom. This movie is no exception. Maximus is portrayed too much as the 'good guy', yet it's pretty obvious that we can't consider him ONLY good. He was a warrior, fought and killed people for Rome. We see him killing people in the arena as a gladiator, yet anyone can realize their lives as men were as important as Maximus', and the Roman empire did wrong to them as it did to Maximus. Don't get me wrong, Maximus was fighting for revenge and for his own life, and we obviously can't consider him a villain. But anger and sadness should be what we see in Maximus, or maybe his character should be partially rehabilitated -- i.e. regretting his life as a legionary and showing frustration for what he has to do to survive in the arena -- before we are TOLD that he is SO good and caring. Sadly, the script doesn't add much depth, and that's a shame because I think Crowe could have done much better with a good script. More, Ridley Scott tricks us by making Maximus a man that once was just a farmer, and that's historically inaccurate (in the Roman empire you couldn't become a Legion commander unless you were a noble). I found the movie too manipulative to make me really care about Maximus' character.More, I found the love story with the princess pathetic. It didn't add anything to the movie, and it was there just to make it a little more appealing to the mass audience. A love story between two 'beautiful people' always works for some. Not for me. I recently saw the DVD version and I think most of the stuff that got cut out was actually much more interesting than this love story.Elsewhere, the movie is really good. The visuals are great, and I liked Commodus' performance as well (although I wouldn't call it outstanding). The battle scenes are very impressive. The fight in the end is awesome, too.I would rate this movie something between 6 and 7 out of ten, but I stick with 6. Sorry, but considering the budget and the potential this is a failure, although a fairly good movie.",6,0,0,26 January 2001
The Godfather," Another kind of 'family movie'
","The Godfather is one of the few films in which I personally did not find any significant weakness even after many viewings. From the direction, to the acting, to the storyline, to the score, The Godfather has the word classic written all over, and it really is not much of a surprise that it is now considered by many one of the top five movies of all time. Perhaps when it comes to cinematic techniques The Godfather has not been as revolutionary as Citizen Kane, but its influence on motion pictures is comparable. Rarely a movie has defined or re-defined a genre as much as this one did for 'gangster movies', but its influence goes well beyond that.The Godfather's influence has been so big through the years that elements of it can be found in virtually every 'organized crime film' nowadays; almost every comedy featuring a gangster in the last few years has spoofed something in The Godfather. The Italian-American old mobster a-la Don Vito Corleone has become one of the most established figures in the public's imagination.But to say that The Godfather is simply 'influential' is to diminish its true qualities, and so is to describe it simply as 'a movie about gangsters'. The Mafia is certainly the main focus the story revolves around (despite the fact that the word is never mentioned), but although the movie never tries to forcedly insert separate subjects it contains an amount of psychological and social subtexts that cannot be overlooked. Considerations on how the social environments changes us, on how moral values appear different from different point of views, on how violence can destroy a human soul, and on how power can corrupt an individual are deeply blended into a story that stays practically always true to complete realism, and the result is a picture of astonishing efficacy and believability.As good as the direction and the story are, it would be unfair not to consider the major role that the actors' performances had in the cinematic triumph that was The Godfather. Praised by many as the best cast to ever appear in an American movie, all the cast in The Godfather succeeds in portraying complex, three-dimensional characters without ever making a slip. The exceptional portrayals of Don Vito and Michael Corleone respectively by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, the performances by Robert Duvall, James Caan and Diane Keaton as Tom Hagen, Santino Corleone and Kay Adams, the ruthless Virgil Sollozzo played by Al Lettieri -- as well as more than a few other roles -- are all perfect for the movie, and they all succeed in making us believe these are real people, not just actors. We are not watching a central character and a bunch of incomplete figures that revolve around him: although Michael Corleone is the character that gets the most screen time, everybody is the center of this world his own way. The movie makes it possible for the viewers to identify with different characters and to observe how their personality and story fits in, and it does it much more effectively than many bloated multiple-storyline movies that came out in the last few years.The movie opens on the wedding of Don Vito Corleone's daughter, Connie (Talia Shire). Don Corleone is a powerful man, and it was not without the use of violence that he achieved this position during the course of his life. The wedding scene gives a perfect setting of where and how the Don's power extends; from the regular worker in a neighborhood, to the immensely popular singer, to the friends in politics and right to the ruthless killer, Don Corleone has links to people ready to ask him favors and to pay him back. Some are trustworthy, some are not, but thanks to his intelligence and intuit the Don can almost always distinguish the two.However, this is 1946, times are changing, and to many of the younger people working in the crime business, Don Corleone's ideas are becoming obsolete. The Don believes that the new trend in the business, narcotics, is too dangerous and the families dealing with it would eventually end up self-destroying; while his family had deals in alcohol and gambling for a long time, part of the Government and law enforcement was ready to close one eye. Drugs are another thing.To this day, Don Corleone was able to keep things together while maintaining his economic and political power, but things will brutally change when a powerful drug dealer name Sollozzo enters the picture. The refusal of Don Corleone to cooperate with Sollozzo, and a weakness immediately spotted by the latter, will ignite a war that will cost many lives, and that will see Michael Corleone, Vito's younger son and the one who never wanted to take part in the family business, lose his 'innocence' and transform into a gangster as ruthless as the people he initially stood up against.I purposely decided not to spoil much about the plot because I believe that the film is perfectly enjoyed without knowing anything in advance, and -- believe it or not -- there are still quite a lot of people who have never seen this movie. There are multiple scenes that manage to create an incredible tension, various twists, and although like any other masterpiece The Godfather can be watched knowing the whole story beforehand and still be a phenomenal experience, I believe it is always a pleasure to see it for the first time and enjoy its multiple climaxes. Besides, to outline such complicated characters and such an emotionally intense story in a short review like this one would be inadmissible.There has been much speculation on how the events in The Godfather novel written by Mario Puzo, the book the film is based on, could be an exposé of true facts. Many believe that the character of Johnny Fontane , for instance, was based on Frank Sinatra's real life, and many of the other characters were modeled after real people. I won't go into that: frankly, I have no idea whether these voices are reliable, although the Frank Sinatra reference seems obviously quite believable.The cinematography of The Godfather is dark and tasteful, and colors are used perfectly to give a true feel of the era it is set in. There is a fair amount of violence, though rarely gratuitous.The Godfather certainly doesn't need my recommendation. The film is universally considered one of the best of all time, and the performances by Pacino and Brando alone is the stuff of legends.",10,491,632,5 March 2002
