Lucky Number Slevin," Well worth watching
","Well... This must be one of the funniest 'what-just-happened?!?!' movies that I've seen lately... It begins somewhat confusing and for about half of the movie lenght it's kept that way... Slevin keeps getting mistaken with some other guy and getting himself punched around due to his big-mouth ('I suppose your mouth got you that nose...'). Then there are two characters that will have you raising your eyebrow: The Boss (Morgan Freeman), that first shows up in front of a dumbfounded Slevin, talking some nonsense about Shmoo, and the Rabbi (Sir Ben Kingsley), that is, YOU GUESSED IT, a Rabbi... Yeah.. and also a gangster... The cherry on top of the cream (those wacky characters) is Slevin's/Nick's somewhat crazy neighbour (Lucy Liu), that seems like a 'Lucy Liu-type' Ally McBeal, always nervous, fast talking and intent on solving the 'Big Mystery'... Well... If I kept going on, I'd eventually spoil the movie, one way or another, so let me rest here...Oh... and by the way, the soundtrack and filming is absolutely wonderful... The songs seem to fit in with the scenes' mood and the way these scenes are filmed give precisely the feeling the director wants us to feel: fast paced, if it was meant to fast paced; calm, descriptive, if it's a story-telling sequence...Hope this was somewhat useful to you; it's my first review...",10,2,5,26 June 2006
