The Blair Witch Project," My favorite movie without a doubt.
","This film is the only film that I make sure people that i know have seen it. It is brilliant, a few of my friends did not like it but they are just ignorant to the fact that it is so hard to make such a spine chillingly scary movie without the use of expensive cameras or big special effects. This film gives you the same feeling if not better that all of the high budget films do but with a no frills approach. It would be a sin for someone to not see this film if they have the chance.

Final Destination," A let down.
","After seeing the preview for this movie a few times I thought that it might be good to watch. I was wrong. There was no suspense during the entire film and some of the deaths were so elaborate (the teachers in particular) that it really turned me off. I enjoy Horror films but this was poor, I rate this film about the same as Urban Legend 2 and I still know what you did last summer, weak.",6,1,1,21 November 2000
