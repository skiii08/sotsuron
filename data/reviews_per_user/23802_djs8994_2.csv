Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A critique
","First of all I would like know what constitutes an 'episode'? Seeing as there were only six in a gargantuan conflict which presumably lasted years, you'd think an 'episode' would be a pretty large turning point? In the original they were: destruction of he death star, Luke is vader' son, and the destruction of another Death Star ( They might have given the most important weapon in the universe a better defence second time around ), however Episode I (and II) hardly anything consequential happens.
I have trouble believing that he would begin writing something as exciting sounding as 'Star Wars' with a story involving tax regulations. Surely, given 15 odd years to spare, a better story could have been written, maybe starting when Anakin wasn't a kid. Why do we have to see in the prequels, Anakin wrestling with his soul to prove to us he's evil? Can't we just accept that in action / adventure films bad guys get evil behind the scenes , which saves us a lot of emotional hassle? Special effects are also a problem in Episode I and II. A reliance on CG effects has made films date even before they have been released. The purpose of special effects is , forgive me if I'm wrong, to make a scene or stunt look real. The models in the originals looked real, unlike the aliens such as jar jar which, I fear will look like brer rabbit in 'Song of the South' in a few years time. But, the various worlds lucas creates are often stunning,  The City Planet, probably lifted from Asimov's Foundation series, looks great, as does the naboo planet.But Critisism of this film, and there has been mountains of it, is useless seeing as the movie made a billion dollars worldwide, But it was obvious that 1999 was a one off and Episode II was to receive little hype and money ( comparitivly) to Episode I.",5,0,1,5 July 2002

","It must come as a shock to anyone to have hugh grant bring up the events of September 2001 in order to sell a movie at its beginning.  To use that actual event which each of us thinks about every day from now on to sell your light and fluffy comedy is pure manipulation of audience's emotions. Having that as your opening gambit didn't put me in a mood to enjoying this film at all. It is a clever idea to have a number of stories interconnect in some way and have them all come to the same conclusion. I am sure this would have been a better film if Richard Curtis had taken maybe 3 of the better stories and rejected the others. The stories on offer here ranged from the very funny to the downright dreadful, and this was the most annoying aspect of the whole film. An example of this was the contrast between the story involving the aging rock star, desperate to find a hit single despite admitting it was awful, and a totally pointless story about 2 pornography actors having fake sex. The Bill Nighy story has the lions share of the films best moments and it was a shame the whole film couldn't be about his character. It just makes it more annoying that we see as much of this tale as we see Laura Linney's troubled woman and her disabled brother. Out of all the stories (I think there were 8) only 2 were substantial enough to maintain any interest throughout he film, the rock star story and the one with Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson. The rest of the story lines included the cliched story about a best man falling in love with a married woman, which involved a rendition of all you need is love' in church which made me feel that all I needed was a nail to stick in my eyeball. We also had Hugh Grant being prime minister, which upset me more than any other part of the film, when he gives a cringe making speech about how great Britain is next to the US president  The special relationship has become a bad relationship' is the gist of it. I couldn't believe how crass and xenophobic this was, and in real life I hope a real prime minister would have been laughed out of office for such a speech, but the whole country seems to have loved Hugh Grant for it in the film. The worst story of the film involved Liam Neeson encouraging his son to break security barriers at heathrow airport just to say goodbye to a girl from his school, something he couldn't manage an hour before apparently.  Oh and he meets Claudia Schiffer at a surprisingly competent school concert to make up for his dead wife.Wouldn't the really existential thing to do at the end have been for a hijacked plane to crash into the airport terminal at the end when they are all having their lovey moments at once? To have Hugh Grant's voice over like at the start saying I told you love was all around but you didn't listen so we had to kill all the characters' This is not to say this is a totally bad film. There are enough laughs in the stories that work to make up for the ones that don't, but it still doesn't excuse the fact that half the film shouldn't have been made.",Null,1,3,3 January 2004
