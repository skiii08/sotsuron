Vertigo," Hitchcock's dizzying masterpiece.
","'Vertigo' refers to the powerful fear of heights, and the disorientation and dizziness that is brought on by it, in the main character played by Jimmy Stewart. That character, 'Scotty' Ferguson, leaves the police force due to a tragedy brought on by his condition, and becomes a private detective for an old friend. What seems like a simple task of following the man's beautiful wife, ends up nearly costing Scotty his sanity.  The film is one of blind obsession, and what people will do to fulfill those obsessions. Stewart, a Hitchcock favorite, is effective in the role of a regular man overcome by obsession and feelings of guilt, almost to the point of madness,  and Kim Novak is memorable in her complex dual roles. 'Vertigo' is a classic, and is among the best of Hitchcock's works - when he was at the 'height' of his powers!",9,2,4,20 March 2004
Raiders of the Lost Ark," A modern day adventure classic!
","Raiders of the Lost Ark is an adventure movie of such rousing fun, action,thrills,chills, and style - it's a modern classic! The film was conceived as a modern throwback to the 'serial' short films of the 40's and 50's, and delivers the impossible cliffhanger moments with panache. Again, Steven Spielberg's brilliant direction keeps things moving along, and the film never fails to deliver. Harrison Ford is perfect as Indiana Jones, and it's hard to believe that the role was originally offered to Tom Selleck. This film really made Ford a leading man that can carry a film all by himself. He's so identifiable as Indiana Jones, without being typecast as the adventurer, as his fine and varied film career can attest. 'Raiders' is the best Indiana Jones film(yet), and the height of pure movie entertainment!",10,0,0,17 March 2004
The English Patient," An epic tale of doomed love
","'The English Patient' can rightly be compared to the films of David Lean, whose sweeping epics such as 'Lawrence of Arabia' and 'Bridge on the River Kwai' must have inspired the director Anthony Minghella. The film is beautifully photographed, and like 'Lawrence', is set in Northern Africa, but during the second world war.  The story is complex, but it boils down to a forbidden love between an opinionated and often difficult archeologist played by Ralph Fiennes and a married woman played by Kristin Scott Thomas.
  The story, based on a novel by Michael Ondaatje, is told in flashbacks by Fiennes' Count Laszlo de Almasy  - the titular character.  The fact that his name does not sound like he's English plays a key role in what unfolds. He has been badly burned in a plane crash, occurring just as the film opens, and is being cared for back in Europe by Hana, an army nurse played by Juliette Binoche. What makes this story epic is the vast sweep across place and time, and the development of characters beyond that of the two ill-fated lovers.     The film makes clear that true love and passion, even with dreaded consequences, can make life worth living, or worth dying for. If you're a romantic at heart, and can appreciate a film without the standard happy endings and simple moral codes, you may find that 'The English Patient' speaks directly to you.",9,87,116,19 March 2004
Alien," This Alien isn't related to E.T.
","'Alien' is both formulaic and unique in many ways. The art direction and set designs are excellent, but similar in some ways to Star Wars. The virtually unstoppable and seldom seen alien is similar to the shark in Jaws. The story, members of a space crew being picked off one by one in a creepy ship, is like the classic 'Ten Little Indians'. What makes the film unique is in the sum of its various parts, and in its innovations.
  POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD: The concept of having the Alien gestate inside a human body and burst out is incredible, and provides one of the most memorable scenes in horror/sci-fi film history. Also, the scene with Dallas in the air shafts, the alien closing in but seen only as a blip on a tracker, is really exciting and quite unique. That scene was even parodied on 'The Simpsons', when Groundskeeper Willie was hunting for Bart's dog in the school's air vents. The film is made up of groundbreaking elements, and that's what made 'Alien' more than just a formula monster movie. It's sequel, 'Aliens', added more of an action element , but the later sequels were a mistake.",9,0,1,22 March 2004
Taxi Driver," The tension builds to a grisly climax
","POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD: Taxi Driver is a character study of a very disturbed individual, Travis Bickle. We know the movie is building up to something, but unlike some movies where the only payoff is the climax, one can be fascinated with the journey into hell that Travis goes on, and which we tag along.  The film has few actual violent scenes, but the ones that it has really make an impact on the viewer.  The robbery scene is raw and disturbing, and the climactic 'attack' on the mob run whorehouse apartment is shattering.  Has any scene in cinema had the raw, disturbing power and ugliness that this scene shows?It is a gruesome ballet of death, like a train wreck in which we can't turn away. Some movies are filled with violent action from beginning to end, but the violence lacks realism or raw, shocking power.  By prescribing it in small intense amounts, Scorsese shows it for what it is - gory, ugly, powerful, fascinating, and not for fun. A popcorn movie this is not!",10,0,0,25 January 2004
Aliens," Better and Meaner than the original!
","'Aliens', the sequel to 'Alien', has all the elements of the original and MORE! The film takes a bit of time to develop the story, with Ellen Ripley going back to the planet from the first film to help save colonists and battle the Aliens, but this time accompanied by some real firepower and a small army of Marines. The development shouldn't be viewed as boring or slow, and besides introducing an interesting scenario, it's the calm before the storm, and what a storm! The action sequences in Aliens are intense and claustrophobic, and they're more the stuff of nightmares than the original.
  The character of Ripley is really developed in this film, and she ranges from uncertain, tough, caring, motherly, sexy, and pure hell with a gun - and it all works. Weaver really became a star with Aliens, and it's probably her best film ever.",10,0,2,22 March 2004
Hellboy," Watching this was Hell, Boy!
","I liked comic book characters as a kid, and still liked 'Spiderman' and 'Hulk' in theaters, so I wanted to like this film about one I never heard of before- HELLBOY! The word of mouth was good, so I gave it a chance. Big mistake.  Even though Hellboy himself was charming and should be given a sitcom or variety show, he just didn't have good material to work with. Hellboy, although clearly derived from the X-Man Wolverine in attitude, muscles, and facial hair, was fun and a devil bon vivant. The supporting characters were also quite fun, the professor played by John Hurt(Hellboy's adoptive father), the green FBI agent to appeal to chicks with his buster brown haircut, and Hellboy's other mutant buddy, Abe Sapien- a telepathic fish man. The fish dude, although listed as being played by another actor, had to be voiced by David Hyde Pierce of 'Frasier' TV fame- if it's not I'll eat some raw halibut! I expected the fish/hero to start complaining about his skinny wife Maris. Conversely, the bad guys and the monsters Hellboy had to fight weren't very appealing- they were either ridiculous looking or had no charisma whatsoever. It was also unclear as to what could stop them, or if they could be killed. They could survive some things, but be destroyed be similar types of attacks- it didn't even make fantasy film/comic book sense.
  Another shortcoming with the film is it's excessive length. Two hours felt like ten, and the storyline seemed pointless. There also never seemed to be real tension, and the fight scenes were hard to follow. Go see 'The Mummy' or 'Hulk' again, and skip 'Hellboy'. Wait till he's hosting a talk show on TV to catch his act.",5,0,1,15 June 2004
The Big Blue," The Big Bore
","I rented 'The Big Blue' expecting and wanting to like it. I expected a lot of beautiful cinematography by the gifted, stylish director Luc Besson (which it does have), and an in depth(pun) exploration of the mysterious, exciting and dangerous world of breath-hold deep diving. What I didn't expect was that most of the film would be devoted to the boring love story between the enigmatic dolphin-man Jacques Mayhol played by Jean-Marc Barr, and the ditzy Johana Baker played by Roseanna Arquette. I'm not against love stories, but it was excruciating in this film. This couple didn't seem to click, and just caused the film to drag out to a long and meandering at 2.5 hours! POSSIBLE SPOILERS: The friendship and rivalry between Mayhol and Enzo Molinari, played by the Besson regular Jean Reno was good, and should have been enough to give the film a 'human' element. However, even this element of the story becomes a cliche, and any movie viewer should be able to predict the outcome of their dangerous competitions.   The diving scenes are few and far between, and only really seem to gain momentum in the last half of the film. The first hour of the film has about 3 minutes of diving action, which should have been the main source of interest in this film. Even later on, the actual diving scenes are interspersed with the 'love story angst' scenes that make the viewer finally resort to the fast forward button.   The movie should have been more true to its subject matter and the men and mysteries surrounding it, and not the typical Hollywood relationship driven drivel it has in spades. It could have been great, but it drowns in cliches and its boring love story.",3,10,24,2 April 2004
The Graduate," Still at the head of its class 35+ years later!
","The Graduate is an incredible film, period! The cast, the direction by Mike Nichols, the screenplay, the soundtrack, are all PERFECT. If the role had gone to Robert Redford, would it still have meant as much? Dustin Hoffman was brilliant, and so believable as the unsure,awkward, and stressed out Ben Braddock that imagining another actor in that role is impossible.  While all the cast was great, it was Hoffman that made it what it was!  Tippi Hedren or Kim Novak probably could have been adequate Mrs. Robinsons, many other young actresses could have played Elaine, but Dustin Hoffman WAS Benjamin Braddock! The film has humour, and is basically a dark comedy, but I think its greatness lies in its drama. The film appeals to the Ben Braddock in all of us.  The unsure, awkward part of ourselves that wants to break free of expectations and do what we feel is right, and will make us happy.  Maybe everything wasn't perfect after the bus ride, but we can imagine and hope it was!",10,1,2,31 January 2004
Jaws," Cemented Spielberg's brilliance
","Jaws is still the ultimate adventure/scare movie ever made. One forgets that this was Spielberg's first BIG budget film (not counting The Sugarland Express), and the pressure he was under was intense.  'Bruce' the shark could have been a phoney looking disaster in the hands of most other directors, but Spielberg adapted to the limitations of his animatronic 'actor' and infused the film with a sense of mystery and forboding by rarely showing the shark, and only in quick glimpses when he did.  The acting was first rate with great actors Robert Shaw as Quint, Roy Scheider as Chief Brody, and Richard Dreyfuss as shark expert Hooper. They made you CARE about the characters. Without that we would WANT the shark to eat them, and all tension and suspense would be nothing but chum in the water.    Perhaps the biggest negative about Jaws is all the sequels it spawned. The movie was great and should have been left to stand on its own, with the sequels draining some of the reputation that the original created. Imagine E.T. coming back with phasers bent on world domination, it just doesn't work.  See Jaws again for the first time, and remember how great it really is/was/will be.",10,2,4,25 January 2004
Rear Window," Another Hitchcock Masterpiece
","'Rear Window' tells the story of a widely travelled photojournalist, played by Jimmy Stewart, who ends up wheelchair bound with a cast from hip to toe. This character, 'Jeff' Jefferies, used to excitement and covering wars and events around the world, suddenly finds himself in his small apartment with nothing much to do except watch his neighbors.  This man seems to be afflicted with a need to watch and observe the world, and isn't happy watching TV or reading books to pass the time, because he never does throughout the film. He does however, find a human drama by observing his neighbors across the courtyard, and he can interpret who they are and what they do by watching their activities throughout the day, and night! However, with one neighbor, played by Raymond Burr, he suspects a sinister and much darker reality, he thinks the man has murdered his wife.  The film is not a typical film of voyeurism, because of Hitchcock's choice of Stewart to play the photographer Jefferies. Stewart is the decent and normal 'everyman', not a twisted and perverse 'peeper'. If the photographer was played by Robert Mitchum or William Holden, men who have played darker, more morally ambiguous characters in their career, maybe the film would have a different meaning. With Jimmy Stewart however, we can be assured that Jefferies is studying his environment and not becoming gratified with what he's viewing. That said, his viewing becomes close to an obsession when he believes a murder has occurred, but not quite to the unhealthy degree as the obsession he portrayed in another Hitchcock classic, 'Vertigo'.  The film is classic, and it is both a time capsule and relevant to today. The lack of air conditioning during the film's heat wave forces people to leave their windows and blinds open, where as today they would most likely be out of view. The relevance is in the relationship between the 24/7 cable news, 'Americas Most Wanted', video and photo obsessed society of today, that voyeurism and the public's desire to provide breaking news is applicable. In this era, we are all like 'Jeff' Jefferies, and that is what makes 'Rear Window' more than a quaint period piece.",10,1,3,21 March 2004
Donnie Darko," Should have been called Ronnie Crapo
","Spoilers? Maybe-- This film was in a word, AWFUL! It was nothing but a long, excruciatingly tedious build up to an answer about what this jerk's deal is.  Is he a psycho killer?  Is he a good kid?  A bit of both?  Who gives a rat's a** !  Why did the character have so many classic psycho nutcase facial expressions? To lead on the viewer and to 'surprise' us! What a load of junk and a waste of our lives to watch this. I rented this dvd because of all the rave reviews and because Jake Gyllenhal has been very good in other films. I like different, Indie type films, but the ratings for this disaster has me totally perplexed!  Rent it and decide for yourself, but please vote if you don't like it, and give it a 1/10!!",1,6,15,30 December 2003
The Birds," A little bird brained, but not too bad
","Hitchcock's 'The Birds', is not quite the masterpiece that ranks with 'Vertigo' and 'Rear Window', but it's still interesting. The film was probably quite influential in the movie trend of having animals of all types attack, and that may not be a good thing. Bees, ants, cats, dogs, spiders, bats, fish, bears and rats are some of the animals used in such films, and I'm sure that guinea pigs, harbor seals, and penguins are in the works by pioneering animal attack auteurs.   The viewer has to suspend their disbelief that sparrows and sea gulls are deadly minions of human destruction, but the special effects and credibility gap make that kind of a stretch. People may think that with today's CGI effects that this film is perfect for a remake, and maybe so, but can't the movie viewing public encourage fresh ideas with our movie dollar votes? Hitchcock tried to cultivate a sense of uneasiness throughout the film, a creepiness and mystery that makes the viewer feel that weird things are possible, but I mostly felt that through Jessica Tandy's strange performance as the mother.   All in all, not a terrible film, and fun as a Hitchcock time capsule sort of film, but not one of Hitchcock's best by a long shot.",7,0,1,22 March 2004
