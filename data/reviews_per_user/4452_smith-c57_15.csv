Ford v Ferrari," Cracking film
","Great story and great acting, bit unsure about Christian bale's accent but that aside was good, although it was quite a long film it didnt drag, the dialogue was solid the action sequences great and you felt like you were there with them",9,13,34,6 November 2019
Rocketman," Fabulous film
","It is going to get inevitable comparisons to bohemian rhapsody, but it is a different sort of film, I loved the queen film and remi malek was superb, still think there were more oscar worthy performances though, this film is more of a musical, with fantasy dance sequences and using the music of Elton John cleverly to tell the story of his youth and start and rise in the music industry, even though it is a musical there is less whitewashing of the darker parts than bohemian rhapsody, which I felt was a bit wishy washy, this shows a lot of the flaws in Elton John, a few people who are portrayed in the film will no doubt not be very happy with the way they are portrayed, especially John Reid, played well by Richard madden, Jamie bell is great as Bernie and well, but taron egerton is amazing as in the starring role, if remi won an oscar than he deserves one even more so",9,3,7,26 May 2019
A Star Is Born," Breathtaking
","I will start by saying this is really isn't my normal sort of film, I remember the 76 version with Streisand and Kristofferson and thought it was ok, but I was blown away by this, lady ga ga is excellent but this film is really bradley Coopers, his performance as a fading alcoholic rock star is truly breathtaking, the music is great and the whole thing was well written brilliantly performed and a proper roller coaster of emotions, I saw plenty of tears in the eyes of people watching as I left, a truly well made emotional winner",10,3,6,12 October 2018
BlacKkKlansman," Powerful and funny
","This is the best film I have seen in a long time, not only is it funny in places, it is superbly written well acted and above all very powerful, the images at the end of the film are particularly poignant and troubling, especially with the black lives matter campaign happening and the presidents reaction to it
Spike lee has pulled of a modern masterpiece with this film, if it is not at least on the list for best film at the Oscars it will be a travesty, this is a must watch, a real eye opener that shows that not as much has changed in the last 50 years in race relations in the USA",10,8,16,19 September 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," It's not a 10 or a 1, make up your mind
","The reviews on here are worthless, people have already made up there minds before seeing it, this film is neither a 1 or a ten, what it is is a solid film with good action sequences, good performances from all the main leads, it ties up most of the storylines quite nicely, the star wars nerds will moan about it because it is not exactly what they wanted, and the fans will give it ten because they would love it no matter what, I would skip the reviews and go and see it, make your own mind up
This film was always going to divide people, I've enjoyed pretty much all of the star wars films, even the hated solo and last jedi, but then again I'm not a nerd who spends his entire time in the cinema analysing every bit of the story and looking for errors, I just turn up, buy some popcorn and sort back",8,12,37,19 December 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," Great fun
","A thoroughly enjoyable two hours spent wallowing in nostalgia, I can understand why it has been such a commercial success, remi malek is great in the lead, still wouldn't be my choice for the Oscar though, been better performances this year in my opinion, Steve Cogan for stan and Ollie for one, but he was good, the film, while fun, felt like it sugar coated the obviously flawed genius and very strange real Freddie, I truly think it is the music that makes the film, the last 15 mins especially, in my opinion there have been better films in the last 12 months that are more original and interesting and far more Oscar worthy, blackklansman, stan and Ollie, and the badly overlooked leave no trace, but as an enjoyable evening at the cinema celebrating the life of a British icon and his music it is a good evening out",8,9,12,2 February 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Might just be the best Spider-Man film ever
","Great film, good solid storyline, great animation and characters, I took my teenage daughter and she loved it, but there is more than enough to keep adults amused as well, a thoroughly enjoyable film for all ages",9,2,4,2 February 2019
Avengers: Endgame," 3 hours just flew by
","Absolutely loved it, every character gets a good chunk of screen time and they all use it to full effect, its laugh out loud funny at times, really touching at times.",10,9,19,25 April 2019
The Favourite," Mad as hell but fun nonetheless
","Loved this from start to the rather odd ending, mainly because of 3 outstanding performances from 3 outstanding actresses, Olivia Colman will get mist of the plaudits and awards, but stone and Weiss matched her in every way, a fun if slightly insane film, filmed in such a way that it almost felt like you were in the palace with them, my only slight gripe was the soundtrack was a bit grating at times",9,3,6,14 January 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," A real marmite film, but I love marmite
","This may be my favourite Tarantino film, he makes you feel that you have traveled back in time to 60s California, Pitt and de DiCaprio are excellent in the main roles, and the supporting cast were also excellent, I could have done with a bit more of Margot robbie as sharon Tate as I thought she was amazing in the role, not as violent as other Tarantino films, well until the final 10 minutes, but I absolutely felt like I was back in the 60s, his use of music was, as always, spot on, this is not a film that all will enjoy, but I did, and I will definitely go back to see it again",9,3,7,14 September 2019
Aladdin," A pleasant surprise
","I really enjoyed this, naomi Scott is beautiful and charming, Aladdin himself is played really well, and will smith is excellent as the genie, some genuinely laugh out loud moments, plenty of action, great songs, out of all Disney's ' live action ' remakes this is so far the best",8,1,3,23 June 2019
Midsommar," Unnerving
","This is a very strange film., the cinematography is amazing, it has some truly graphic and horrific imagery and florence Pugh is outstanding in the lead role, she will win an oscar one day, but probably not for this.
I left the cinema unsure of what I had seen, but I did enjoy it, it is totally different from anything I have seen and for that I applaud it, I felt slightly uncomfortable all the way through, and I'm pretty sure that was what ari aster was aiming for, I personally preferred this to hereditary his last film, as I hated the ending of that film, but you can see it is clearly by the same director
I'm not sure if I loved it, but it certainly had an impact on me",8,3,7,9 July 2019
Joker," Masterpiece
","This is an absolute masterclass in character acting from Joaquin Phoenix, not so much a superhero/villain story, it is more of a study of mental health issues in society today, drug addiction and the social issues facing people who society has left behind, you will struggle to find any actor who deserves the oscar this year",10,3,6,18 October 2019
It Chapter Two," A difficult book, but a pretty good effort
","I loved the first film, it was a joy, the second installment was not quite as good, but I thought they did a pretty good job with what is difficult source material, pennywise is suitably scary, and the cast do a pretty good job, there are some proper jump scares and quite a lot of laughs",8,1,2,14 September 2019
Jojo Rabbit," Funny, and very moving
","What a fantastic film, hilarious, especially the first half, it had the feel of a mel Brooks film for the first half, the second half of the film while having plenty of laughs was also very moving and bought a tear to my eye, especially one particular scene.
The young boy who plays jojo was very good, and the supporting cast was also excellent, a special mention to the outstanding thomasin Mackenzie, she is brilliant as the young Jewish girl, I confidently predict this girl will one day win an oscar after seeing her in this and her equally outstanding performance in leave no trace",10,3,7,4 January 2020
