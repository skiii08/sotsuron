The Blair Witch Project," The ultimate journey into darkness.
","'The Blair Witch Project' is the ultimate journey into darkness. Unlike the typical Hollywood horror film, it isn't the pre-packaged, slick, glossy production that a 'Nightmare on Elm St.' or a 'Friday the 13th' film is. It is a very unsettling film to watch, and even more unsettling to stomach. I have some words of warning for those that see 'The Blair Witch Project': expect to be left shaking and trembling when that hour-and-a-half descent into Hell ends. In short: this film WILL scare the Hell out of you. Enough said.",10,1,2,15 August 1999
