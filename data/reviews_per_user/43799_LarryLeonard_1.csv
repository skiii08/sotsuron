Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Talk talk talk...
","Boring.  All they do is talk.  Jar Jar is incomprehensible.  The actors are wooden and/or terrible.  The plot is byzantine.  No characters.  Since I have to have four line to post this, let me add that the writing was amateurish, and the dialog laughable.",3,0,1,26 November 2001
