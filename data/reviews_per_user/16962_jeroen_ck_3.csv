"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Pretty Bad
","I really don't understand these films like 'hot fuzz' or 'shawn of the dead'. I think they are all pretty bad. And 'Run fat boy run' was even worse. For starters the main character isn't really fat!! It would have been much more funny if he was. My problem with these films is that they tell you something like a guy who never finishes anything, and then he douse. and thats the plot, thats not funny at all. It's all so simpel and boring and emotional like a really bad friends episode. The directing was bad, Simon Pegg just was'nt convincing, Dylan Moran was alright butt not great as the best friend and hank azaria played a good antagonist. Butt I much rather watch 'the black adder' or the 'young ones'. Thats real British comedy for you. I guesse its all about taste. I just don't get why people like these films and why they get the money to make these movies. Lets just say they can do much beter and hopefully some day they will.",1,5,11,18 July 2008
Wanted," Lame
","Yet another teen wet dream on the screen. Any adolescent could dream up such a (Hey look at how cool I am) story. I myself (23) daydream now and then. Butt I wouldn't make a movie out of some delusion of grandeur. This movie just pushes the credibility to far. I mean how 'special' or 'talented' do you have to be to be able to stop a bullet with another bullet. And they pick there targets out of a peace of cloth??? Hmm...They don't explain things very well. And in the end what really happened? He works in a dead end job. Becomes an assassin. Gets betrayed. Takes revenge (with rats). And then asks us: What have we done lately? I say, 'Make love not war.'",1,9,16,23 January 2009
Avatar," Do you think they payed rights to 'dances with wolves'?
",Is there any creativity left in Hollywood? This movie is like a collection of clich√©s we've seen over and over again. It is pure escapism and nothing more.Why would we focus on earth when we have this blue planet where we can simply start over again. So far the idea of the movie add some battle sequences and a few million dollar special effects and you have yourself a blockbuster.What I really don't understand is why the na'vi people are almost exactly like the native Americans. I think you would at least try to cover up that the movie is just like 'Dances with wolves'. Except the character development and engaging story of course. A good film if you have some time to kill and don't want to think to much. Butt I cant help thinking it could have been so much better with some more creativity and thought.,1,10,17,29 April 2010
