Captain Phillips," Tom Hanks Best!
",What a strong excellent film. This would have to be one of Tom Hanks best. The strength in the film is amazing and it expresses excellent feeling towards the audience. The storyline is strong and true. Its accurate to the real story and far from over the top. The characters are amazing and true to themselves. Each of the Somalian fisherman are excellent and all strong individuals. The film lacked a bit of music but it was not absolutely necessary for this type of film. The US army are frustrating as usual but I can understand why. Some seriously deep tactics would have had to been put into place to successfully gain back the Captain. I would like to know what else the US army did to show the Somalian government who is really leading. Maby this was done after the incident. Regardless of this Somalia have a terrible record and the US armies quick reactions saved all passengers. The leader payed the price though. 33 Years in jail and he now has to live with the fact that it was him that caused the other three to be killed. What a sad life he is going to have. Overall one of the best movies of the year. 5 Stars all the way! I would recommend this to anyone! Definitely one of my favourites! What an inspiring film!,9,1,3,23 June 2014
Blood Diamond," One of my favourites!
",This film is simply just excellent in so many ways. The setting (Sierra Leone) is picturesque but behind this beautiful natural living country lives lies upon lies and a bloody civil war continuing fatefully and showing no luck of stopping. Leonardo Di Caprio chance to both attempt bringing peace to the country with a photographer and journalist and make some earnings from the illegal diamond industry. Blood Diamond takes you on a long story all starting when a local village father is taken to work in the diamond industry and given little no nothing to live off. In the end it is up to him and others to go on a journey to find his son and too a multi million dollar diamond. This would have to be one of my favourites movies ever! I would definitely recommend it to anyone and as well as 'Hotel Rwanda' which in my mind is even better. The sound in this film was absolutely outstanding and both the characters and graphics were too simply brilliant. If it wants for Leonardo Di Caprio's stupid and pathetic accent that continued to change from Australian to South African to American to I don't even know what! Maby he wasn't the right character for the show but in saying this he did a 7.5-8.5 out of 10 for me. All this put a side I would give the film a 10 out of 10!!! What an amazing inspiring movie!,9,0,0,24 June 2014
Godzilla," Boring Plot- Excellent effects
","Godzilla 2014 is a vast improvement over the quite terrible 1998 film. The film started well and I enjoyed the mix of Science and Geography thrown in there especially about the nuclear reactor. It kept the film motivating and purposeful. Sadly this all faded leaving Godzilla and two other large creatures roaming around the world destroying various things. From here on end the film had a very poor plot (Kill Godzilla) and the acting was only mediocre. The US army were both good and at the same time pathetic. Trying to shoot the beast quite obviously didn't help at all. So what did they try doing... Blow up Godzilla! This just reminded me how lame the creativity of this film really was. In saying this the effects were brilliant and watching the film in 3D IMAX made things even better. The sound effects and music is to be commended too. I enjoyed the opening theme song also, however I would not recommend this movie.",4,0,1,23 June 2014
