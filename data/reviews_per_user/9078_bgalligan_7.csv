Kill Bill: Vol. 2," My female mind liked Volume 1 better. Vol. 2 still packs a wallop.
","I had rented Kill Bill: Vol. 1 last week. I liked it so much I couldn't wait for Vol. 2. Opening day, I was there. I might have had my hopes up too much. Volume 1 centered completely around the women. The guys are on the back burner 'til Vol. 2. That's probably why I reacted more favorably to Vol. 1. Vol. 2  is still a finely crafted film. I'm guessing that men liked Vol. 2 better since men are more prominent. Vol. 2 is a better film emotionally. The violence is less cartoonish. The fight between 'The Bride' and ole one-eyed Daryl Hannah is quite realistic. (I kept thinking of Blade Runner during that scene). Well, as realistic as it can be. Who can really get thrown into walls time after time and continue fighting. Tarantino owes as much to spaghetti westerns as he does to martial arts films (which I've never been that fond of). Aren't nearly all of the man-with-no-name Eastwood films similar in theme? A wronged man gets his revenge. In this case, the Bride gets her revenge. I will definitely see these two volumes again on DVD. Tarantino infuses each film with so much style that one viewing won't do. Thumbs up for sure.",9,2,4,21 April 2004
The Patriot," predictable plot and some melodramatic dialogue redeemed to Mel Gibson's acting and some genuine moments
","First off, this will contain spoilers. I had high hopes for Patriot, and so I was mildly disappointed. Some scenes just didn't ring true for me. The whole subplot dealing with the lone black man in the cast was just another way to show how honorable Mel's character was. Simplistic dialogue and unrealistic for the time period. Another phony scene is when Gabriel's (Mel's son) honey gives her speech to propel the town's menfolk to take up the fight. Oh, she looks pretty, but the dialogue is lame and her acting worse. It's easy to make comparisons to Braveheart, which is a far better film. The Patriot is no history lesson, and I didn't expect it to be. But, there are enough genuine moments and exciting action sequences to make this a totally watchable film. Granted, all the set pieces are predictable: Son goes after villain, gets killed...father then goes after villian..but the cinematography is gorgeous and Mel holds it all together.He works well with children. It's difficult when actors become stars to not compare one film to another, or one character to another. Stars become stars playing to their strengths. In one scene in particular, Mel's face is spattered in blood. I couldn't help but think of his painted blue face from Braveheart. Maybe Mel should go for the yellow next time and then he'd have all the primary colors covered. On a final note, the Patriot isn't GREAT movie making, but it's entertaining and even rousing in some scenes.",7,0,0,3 July 2000
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," More vulgar than I expected, saved by Carell's performance.
","I wanted to see this based on all the favorable reviews. I have to remember in the future that most reviewers are male. A man might find the excessive vulgarity and profanity funnier than I did. The 18-25 year old males will undoubtedly love this film. This movie is rated R and it is about a 40 year old virgin, but funny shouldn't mean four letter words in practically every scene. To be honest, some of the male talk left me in the dark. I guess you have to be a guy to know the 'guy speak'. I was expecting sharper dialogue, humor based more on observation. There are a few good one liners, but I wished for more. In the showing I saw, I imagine the 65-70 old woman in front of me was cringing a good deal of the time. Some scenes made 'me' uncomfortable. I'm guessing this movie will play better for men than most women.Steve Carell, so good in NBC's show 'the Office', is equally excellent here. I was surprised at his range. He never makes Andy seem dorky, just a little out of the loop when it comes to women. His performance saves the film. The supporting characters are all excellent. I wish they had been given less raunchy material. I still give this movie a thumbs up, but with reservations, especially if you're easily offended.",8,7,16,19 August 2005
The Fast and the Furious," A life action cartoon.
","I only saw this movie because it was one of the few DVDs I hadn'tseen in someone's collection. What a waste of time. Maybe youhave to be a guy to appreciate a movie like this. Better yet, maybeyou have to be a guy who only likes action and a brain dead script.Some suits simply decided what would attract gobs of 18-25 yearold men on opening weekend. (We'll start with this undergroundculture of young, hip people...yeah...yeah..and then they'll drivethese cool 'tricked out' cars...yeah..yeah..yeah.. and gorgeousbabes will be hangin on their bulging biceps.... these hip guys willhijack semis to pay for all of their toy cars) Boring. The acting wasokay and Paul Walker is easy on the eyes. There are some goodmovies in this genre..e.g. the Mad Max movies, but this one's aturkey.",1,4,10,15 February 2004
Seabiscuit," Loved the book, movie 'almost' as good.
","I just finished reading a previous review lambasting the liberties the script takes with the facts of this true story. Well,  we can't have a six hour movie (as much as I'd like to). Characters have to be trimmed and scenes are often changed to heighten the drama.Other characters and scenes were left on the cutting room floor as well. I myself wondered why Pollard has no wife and Charles Howard has no other sons. It is a flaw to not mention that Seabiscuit often carried 130 pounds in weight while other horses in the field often carried much less. I guess handicapping is a thing best left to horse enthusiasts. To be fair, there is a quick shot listing the entries in the last race shown and the weights assigned to each horse. But, you can't see that Seabiscuit is carrying the most weight. So, maybe this ended up on the cutting room floor.(Can you tell I wanted a longer movie)Each character is fully realized and the time is taken to develop them. Jeff Bridges, Chris Cooper, Tobey McGuire are all superb, as is the comic relief character 'Tick Tock', played by William H. Macy. The film beautifully captures the flavor of the book and by the end, I had a big lump in my throat. For once,  a movie about characters instead of explosions and mind numbing violence.Hoorah for a job well done. My only quibble is the excessive use of documentary footage and still photos, especially during the big match race, which broke up the flow of the scene. I guess the producers felt they had to include such footage because audience members younger than forty would need to know when this movie took place. Sadly,  how many teenagers actually know when the depression was? I would have preferred to use the characters and dialogue more to bring the era to life. I'll give this movie 9 out of 10.",10,0,0,25 July 2003
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," I can't believe how much I enjoyed this movie.
","I'm a forty-one year old woman who liked 'Pulp Fiction' and 'Fargo' immensely. It's no surprise that I loved this film. Yup,  loved. Maybe I'm at just the right age to appreciate the oddball references to pulp TV and film. Tarantino is obviously having fun. There isn't a wasted piece of film anywhere. Uma Thurman surprised me. I've never had much reaction to her before, aside from Pulp Fiction. She's quite effective whether she's trying to move her big toe or slash another of the 88. I've got to buy the soundtrack. Who'd believe that you could have music of Zamfir (the pan flute guy) and the theme from Ironside in the same film?The dialogue is priceless and reminiscent of 'Pulp Fiction'. Half smart ass vulgarity, half philosophical musings. I can't wait for Vol. 2. I think I'll have to see it in the theatre. Excellent Tarantino.",10,11,24,16 April 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," from a 41 year old woman who never read the books
","I have seen all three 'Rings' films in the theater. That's the onlyplace that does them justice. I thought the final chapter had a badcase of not knowing when to quit-itis. The director couldn't seem tolet the story go. The major battle sequence was beyond exhilarating. (spoiler) And,of course I loved the woman who did the faceless bad guy in..'I amno Man!' He crumbled like the wicked witch in Oz. I don't really takethese movies seriously. I've never really cared about any of thecharacters. Maybe you need to be a male who grew up reading thetrilogy. The trilogy is pure entertainment.Elijah Wood(en) seemed to be striking two notes. Either he wascrying or he was glaring in rage. What a dull character. I guess Iwanted him to be stronger. Throw the ring in already. I guess wecould blame the ring. Maybe he was hypnotized. I found Sam muchmore interesting because Sean Astin's a better actor.I guess I'd give this a movie a 7-8. I have a difficult time givingfantasies a 10. Oh..is it just me? or is Gollum incredibly difficult to understandmost of the time, in every movie. I guess I'll have to put on theclose captioning when I rent the DVD to figure him  out.",7,0,2,4 January 2004
