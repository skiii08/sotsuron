Insidious: Chapter 2," James Wan Does It Again!
","James Wan picks up from the last installment and certainly does not disappoint. This film really does live up to the hype. After watching it, I was so glad that I recently watched 'Insidious Chapter I'. I do agree that you can watch the film without seeing the first part however I think if you do, you will appreciate part II even more. James Wan's intricate woven plot proves that horror films don't need to be linear with some blood and gore to be scary. James Wan's direction for 'The Conjuring' and 'Insidious I' was spot on. It is no different this time around. Insidious Chapter II deals with many sub layers like time travel but Wan seamlessly pulls it off. He seems to have mastered the use of lighting which creates this creepy yet thrilling atmosphere. The pacing of the film is perfect and personally I think an improvement from last time. I like the way Wan creates suspense with no music just silence. It isn't too obvious when the scares are going to happen. That sense of not knowing is the reason why I enjoyed it. Also if Wan does go for a big scare, it will be a 'BIG' scare. Insidious II has good acting, good suspense and definitely some good scares. Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne on top form once again. Definitely go and see 'Insidious chapter II'. It certainly is one of the better horror films in recent years. You will not be disappointed!",8,1,2,13 September 2013
Gravity," 'Houston... We Have A Few Problems!'
","The script was very average. The plot didn't offer anything innovative. I don't think a person will look back 10 years later and say 'Gravity, what a timeless gem'. It just isn't that kind of movie. I think the effects covered over the cracks of a very mediocre film.On the other hand, the good things about Gravity. It is well acted. This film really did depend on two main roles. Clooney and Bullock portrayed their characters very effectively. In my opinion, one of the most likable characters Clooney has ever portrayed! The special effects are outstanding! I went to see this in cinema and yes, sometimes you would forget you are on planet earth! The lighting, sound, cinematography and the design was sharp! I liked the tone Alfonso Cuarón sets but I do think the story dropped off in a few places. I can see why some found it a bit dull and boring. It is a good sci-fi flick however the script was a real let down because it could have been so much better! But don't leave that turn you off, go and see it for yourself! It is worth the watch!",6,0,3,2 March 2014
Dallas Buyers Club," Captivating! Tackles A Significant Subject With Sincerity And Excellence
","With a year filled with amazing films it takes something very special to eclipse them. Dallas Buyers Club is that something special!A film that takes an important subject matter like AIDS/HIV but doesn't hold back. Bares the true nature and spreads awareness to its viewers makes a great film in my opinion! Powerful and absorbing, you can't take your head away from the screen. Matthew McConaughey with a disappointing start to his film career proves that he is one of the best actors right now! The performances from Jared Leto and McConaughey are outstanding! Not only their unbelievable character transformations but the emotion, the power, the rawness they brought to their roles is something very special.Riveting story, incredible performances! A film that needs to be seen!",10,2,3,8 March 2014
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Bit Of Mitty In All Of Us!!
","Who hasn't daydreamed about their perfect life? We can all relate to this film, whether it's that horrible boss at work, getting bullied, self confidence issues, impressing that girl you like. This is what makes Mitty such an enjoyable experience!Visually stunning and thought provoking, it pushes the boundaries but in a good way! You really get the see Stiller in a different light but an interesting light. The plot is entertaining but kept simple and so it should be so that it can carry that universal message that, 'Everything has a purpose'. The acting is good. Who else is better playing the horrible villain than Adam Scott? Ben Stiller's directorial approach is spot on, the landscapes are visually beautiful and I can't wait to see what he does in the future!The soundtrack is a reason to see this film alone! Amazing. Perfectly intertwined which fitted the movie perfectly. Honest and uplifting! Personally, 'Jose Gonzalez' and 'Of Monsters And Men' the stand outs for me. If you are looking for a entertaining, adventure film that is uplifting and well performed than look no further! Give it a chance!",9,0,2,2 March 2014
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," A Webtastic Sequel!!
","The first Amazing Spiderman was good, this was even better! So many things they got right. Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone are amazing as always. Their chemistry lights up the screen, which is great because even between the action scenes, you are glued to the screen.Jamie Foxx, brilliant as Electro. Even if I am a small bit biased with Electro being my favourite villain ever in spiderman! :) Some people say that green goblin(harry) was under developed and yes he was. However I actually liked it that way. I like having one great villain. They also probably didn't want to repeat the same mistakes Spiderman 3 did and have too many villains.The action scenes were really well done. I know some people who thought there was too much effects and your eyes felt like popping, but it didn't really bother me all that much.Hans Zimmer shows his genius once again. Adding dupstep to Electro's scenes was pure perfection. It probably sounds like a risk on paper but once you witness it (especially in cinema), it fits the film completely.Thoroughly enjoyable! Truly amazing! Good plot, excellent effects, great acting! What's more to be said... :)",8,9,24,20 April 2014
Prisoners," Dark, Thought Provoking, Masterpiece!!
","Yes, this might not be a film for the action nuts out there however if you like a dark, gritty film that keeps you guessing throughout then this is right up your street!The intricately woven plot that Guzikowski has written tells the story of two families searching for their missing children and the detective who is wrapped up in it all. Ultimately the film explores the human mind and shows how far people can be pushed to their breaking points. The dark, moody atmosphere Denis Villeneuve creates fits perfectly with the film.Jake Gyllenhaal and Hugh Jackman transcend among an array of highly skilled performances from the whole supporting cast. Both actors at the pinnacle of their acting powers, career bests for sure. While watching, you really begin to understand and feel for every character. The plot is absorbing and suspenseful. It took me 2 viewings to fully understand the whole story. The little things I missed the first time around makes me admire this film even more. The true testament of a great film in my book. A dark, precise, mysterious, masterpiece with a little violence thrown in means it's a must watch for any thriller fan! In my view, one of the best films of the year!",9,2,4,1 March 2014
Man on Fire," Denzel at his finest!...Not Just A Typical 'Shoot Em Up' Film!!
","Who doesn't like a revenge driven, all out action flick every once in a while? Luckily this film goes above a typical action 'shoot em up'.Denzel Washington as always, outstanding! Without doubt one of his best performances! His portrayal of Creasy is captivating! Creasy is a complex role with many different sides. He is strong, brave, troubled, vulnerable yet caring man. The development of his character is mesmerizing. Denzel handles it with such ease! The supporting cast is also phenomenal. Christopher Walken, Mickey Rourke, Dakota Fanning to name but a few all putting in top draw performances. The relationship between Dakota's character and Denzel's makes this film special in my view. Some may call it cliché but I thought it was handled superbly by the actors and Scott's direction. The pacing was perfect. The soundtrack is also brilliant. Shades of 'Gladiator' in some parts but who cares? It does a great job translating the emotion throughout.Okay, I won't say to much. However I will say that this is not just a typical blow up things action flick. The plot, the pacing, the character developments, the raw emotionally charged performances will keep you glued to your screen. I think its suitable for any movie lover! You won't be disappointed!",10,4,6,12 April 2014
Godzilla," Godzilla! Doesn't Quite Get There...
","First of all let me say I am a huge fan of Godzilla! Always was and always will be. When I heard about the stellar cast involved like Ken Watanabe, Juliette Binoche and most of all Bryan Cranston, I was excited. Actors at the pinnacle of their performing powers. Godzilla started of so well. Full of interesting characters, plot points and the premise was very good. However what let this movie down was killing of the best actor in the film too early... Bryan Cranston. Just when you begin to understand and feel for the character, they go and kill him off! Aaron Paul Johnson is a good actor and improving but in my view he was not ready to take control and lead this huge blockbuster film. At some points I lost interest. Towards the end it felt like it was dragging on. I just wanted Godzilla to fight it out already. It took a good while for Godzilla and his enemy to be introduced which I didn't mind. I loved the way the movie tried to focus on character development rather than unnecessary all out cgi action but again if you kill off the best actors than what are you left with?...The good things about Godzilla are the effects were really good. The beginning was thrilling. The performances were believable. Overall it was a good popcorn flick, good action but it is not the film I will watch again. Didn't leave a lasting impression unfortunately but glad they tried to reboot it and hey... at least it's better than the last Godzilla film. :)",6,1,3,2 June 2014
