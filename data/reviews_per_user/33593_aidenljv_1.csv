Blade Runner 2049," Slow paced overly long movie
","Slow paced overly long movie, cinematography, production design and visual effects best this year. Just thought the whole movie was too long and drawn out very boring in places where nothing happened. Personally I never liked all that fog in movies people in the cinema were having conversations with each other while they waited for stuff to happen. it's too long and simply",6,1,4,3 January 2018
