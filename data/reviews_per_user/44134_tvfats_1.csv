50 First Dates," OK, Not The Best Flick Ever Put On Celluloid, but...
","Adam Sandler has a track record of several clunkers followed by a dandy nice, entertaining flick...This is one of the latter...Smartly directed, the flick hits your emotional target as the tale weaves it's way from the first chance meeting in the diner to the wonderful fulfilling ending...Adam and Drew man the helm quite ably...Supporting roles are filled by many of Adam's regulars...Overall this is a winner because it can hit and tug your heartstrings 'ON' button...You want laughs, you got 'em...You want beautiful scenery, you got it...You want an entertaining sit down with a fun flick, this is it...Enjoy one of Adam's better efforts...Aloha!",8,1,1,7 April 2012
