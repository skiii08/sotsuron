The Monuments Men," Terrible
","For a movie with such good actors, this was surely a big disappointment! What a huge waste of talent! What a waste of time watching it! I expected much more from a film with such big names. I think the basis of the film, the book,would have been such a rich source of data for the book. Somehow this did not translate when the film was made. To me, it seemed that a group of good actor - buddies got together and decided they could make a movie starting themselves . It was self promoting and shallow. I'm sure there was much more to this story than what was shown in the film. Certainly far from being their best work!",Null,1,3,15 February 2014
