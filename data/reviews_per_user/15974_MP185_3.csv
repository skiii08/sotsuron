Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," DVD One: Star Wars on disc
","Of course, of all the Star Wars films to put on DVD, I'd least like to see 'The Phantom Menace.'  I'm personally dying to see 'Empire Strikes Back' in all its digital glory, but from what I've heard, we've got to wait 4 more years for that.  As for the 'Episode One' DVD I have to say the packaging is impressive.  And the visual and sound effects are simply state of the art. Unfortunately, the movie still stinks.  It is a horrible, horrible film. The dialogue is atrocious, the acting stiff and lifeless and the editing annoyingly overkill.The DVD has been hyped for having tons of extras but don't be fooled. Basically, the 2 disc set contains the movie, a few documentatries, an audio commentray and several delted scenes.  After you get done watching them you might feel as cold and empty as you did after first seeing 'Episode One' in theaters.  The one hour documentary 'The Beginning' is interesting, but I couldn't imagine watching it more than one time.  As for the rest, the cut scenes included amount to more bad fotage from a bad movie.  The exception is the waterfall sequence which actually packs some of the excitement of old Star Wars films.  The rest of the scenes are excuses for ILM to show off more computer effects.'The Phantom Menace' is not only a lousy film its also a dangerous one. Because it hurts the Star Wars legacy, which was firmly in place thanks to the original trilogy.  In Episode One, Lucas changes many of the mythical aspects of the saga, turning the force into midichlorians and making Anakin a 'virgin birth.'  And rumors have it that Lucas will add new scenes into the DVD versions of the classic trilogy to tie it into the prequel films. I'd personally rather that George stop making Star Wars films than dare to alter the classic trilogy.",Null,0,1,16 December 2001
American Psycho," Misunderstood Cult Classic
","People overlooked this film when it was released in 2000 because of the book's bad reputation and the controversy over making a film about such a dark character.  Having read the book all I can say is the film maker's had their work cut out for them.  Bret Easton-Ellis's novel is both disturbing, daring and unforgettable.  And most of the stories described could not be put on film without risking an triple X rating for gore and sexual violence. So rather than go that route, the film makers decided to make 'American Psycho: the movie' more of a black comedy with clever satire. Unfortunately, most of this humor was misunderstood by the movie public.
Simply put, 'Psycho' is a very funny movie.  The lead character, Patrick Bateman takes himself very seriously but is seen as a bit of a bafoon by those around him.  I believe the film version of Ellis's book is meant to be a comedy of errors, albeit very dark in nature.  Every scene has a humorous undercurrent to it.  (WARNING:  SPOILERS ahead) From Bateman's seemingly endless array of skin cleansors to the bizarre sight of him running naked down a corridor carrying a chainsaw), its all meant to be shocking and also one big joke.  During the book you can never tell if Patrick is imagining his psychotic episodes or if they are really happening.  The film makes pretty clear that most of what's happening is part of Bateman's sick fantasy world.  Made clear by the unbelievable sequence where Bateman goes on a shooting spree and somehow evades capture by blowing a cop car.
I think this movie will pick up popularity in years to come and become a cult film.  The film is indispensible because its one few that dares to make fun of the 80's chronic materialism and gross excess.  All in the while making the ultimate 80's success story, Patrick Bateman look like exactly what he is, 'A big dork.'",Null,0,0,16 December 2001
Blow," You'll feel sorry for a drug dealer
","'Blow' is one of those 'only in America' type movies.  No where else could the story of a drug dealer be worth 2 hours on screen.  The irony is I found myself really feeling empathy for George Jung, realizing that he's really not that bad of a guy.  And the movie itself doesn't glamorize what he did for a living.  It shows his mistakes in glaring view.  In he end, you can't help thinking that George hurt no one but himself by his actions.  The DVD features an interview with the man himself and its both disturbing and fascinating.  Seeing George (SPOILERS AHEAD)  locked down in jail, looking sickly and lonely is very moving.  The one part of the story that really stuck with me is the part about his daughter, the 'only thing in his life with any real meaning.'  That is truly devastating.  You can tell George really wanted to be a good father but had the wrong ideas on what that entailed.",Null,0,0,16 December 2001
