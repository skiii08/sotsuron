First Man," First man to leave theatre
","This is the worst movie I saw in 10 years .
Close ups of camera made me so sick , there is no touching drama ,
Neil's daughter died , I even didn't blink .. all his friends died in explosions .. that was funny not even sad .
The music was bad .. the moment he touched the moon wasn't any special . Even the ending was ... ughhhhh that wasn't an ending of a 2 hours movie .. thats a waste of time .. stay away",1,1,4,21 October 2018
