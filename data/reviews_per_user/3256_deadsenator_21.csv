The Ring," Good suspense. Above average film. - 6 of 10
","I enjoyed this film.  It has it's share of faults, but overall it was okay. I vacillate between a 5 and a 6, but I'll give the film the edge because I liked the surrealism throughout.  The dialogue was almost poor in areas, but I can overlook that.  After all, Naomi Watts is quite easy on the eyes...  6 of 10",6,0,0,6 August 2003
Minority Report," A two-hour commercial! - 6 of 10
","Did anyone else get annoyed at the amount of commercials that are in the future?  This, to me, was one of the big problems with the film.  I felt sold out to a two hour Pepsi commercial.  I get sick of it in real life, and I will not tolerate it in film.  That said, the rest was not bad.  But it wasn't fantastic, either.  The special effects were well done, but not awe inspiring.  The dialogue was nothing that moved me.  The acting was solid and Tom Cruise did well, but the plot was quite plain and predictable.  I really expected more from those involved with this film, but maybe this is the tripe that most mainstream moviegoers eat up.  Eck.  How it can rate in the top 100 movies on IMDB, I'll never know as I can think of at least 200 better movies.  But Spiderman did the same before it deservedly fell further back.  Please, people, expect more.  I can only give it a 6.",6,0,0,9 July 2002
Underworld," Good story, better effects, but bad acting. - 6 of 10
","I liked the effects, the story and the plot twists.  That's about it.  The one dimensional characters were flat and hollow, although the story helps to fill some holes later (too little, too late).   The actors presentations were terrible.  The only one that really added anything extra was Michael Sheen (Lucian).  The writing was awful and better care should have been taken here.  'Leave us!' is used a bit too much.  The vampires use of guns got tiresome.  The vampires really didn't do anything to impress me at all, but this film is worth seeing for the special effects on the werewolves alone.  The job done by the crew is fantastic.  Watch the extra dvd footage for some of the behind the scenes magic.  -  6 of 10",5,0,0,14 March 2004
The Others," Not bad, but it's been done before. - 6.5 of 10
","This really wasn't a bad movie, but I got pretty tired of Nicole's screaming.  We were constantly adjusting the volume between the overly loud yelling/music and the too quiet dialogue.  The pace and intensity was good, but this idea has been done before, eh?  And all too recently to be overlooked.  Most other copies have waited a bit.",6,0,1,16 June 2002
We Were Soldiers," Not bad, but not great, either. - 5.5 of 10
","Not a blockbuster war film, but it had it's moments.  I liked the comparisons between the opposing sides' commanding officers.  Perhaps it could've been played out better.  I really wondered how the terrain really looked.  This set looked false, but not having been to Vietnam, I don't know.  I also was very confused how someone runs into battle standing fully upright looking like they're trying to catch a bullet in his teeth.  This happened constantly in the film and frustrated me.  Keep your head down!",6,0,1,10 March 2003
Elf," I like Will, but I was disappointed with this. - 5 of 10
","More Will, less cruddy writing and plot.  It has it's moments, but ultimately turns into a middle of the road X-mas film, which is fine for most.  Will could have raised the marks on this film by displaying more of his talents and fleshing out more of his scenes, but sadly the writing and direction missed the target.  I really like Jon Favreau, too!  Perhaps his next effort will lead to more success as this film will fade into memory in a few months.  Admirable try, but only 5 of 10 from me.",6,2,4,16 November 2003
The Bourne Ultimatum," Bouring. What's the big dealio? - 5 of 10
","I guess I miss the point of these films. Big drum beats, shaky camera and quick scenes don't equate to a good film, in my opinion. I could use a bit more depth, but I guess it's not fitting for the plot. The frenetic pace actually wore on me at first and then bored me. The 'twists' really didn't seem all that surprising and the end did not seem all that fantastic or unbelievable to me. Is this the best they can come up with? With films like this being swallowed like precious wine from everyone, Hollowood won't be making anything good for a long time. Come on people, demand better. I can only go 5 of 10 here and as I think about it more and more, it's generous.",4,2,7,18 August 2007
The Fast and the Furious," What a dud. The cars are the only high point. - 3 of 10
","If you watch this film, do it only for the cars.  They're the only things worth seeing.  Crap plot, lame acting and terrible dialogue add up to a waste of Vin Diesel's time.  I really enjoy seeing Mr. Diesel on the screen, but this film did nothing to advance his career.  I do hope that he's more selective the next go around.  I gave it a 3 of 10 for the cars and racing. It was probably too high...",3,2,5,16 February 2002
Seabiscuit," Good stuff. Well worth seeing. - 7.5 of 10
","I rounded my vote up to eight even though I gave it a seven point five.  It warrants it.  It's the first time in a long while that I've heard folks clap and cheer in a theater.  I find this peculiar, but sometimes people need this sort of release.  The film itself was well done.  There are not many flaws and none that warrant a mention.  The casting was wonderful, the script solid and the fine acting matched a fine story.  This is one of the better 'feel good' stories I've seen in a long while.  7.5 of 10",8,0,0,17 August 2003
The Mummy Returns," The Mummy Returns: Empty Headed
","This is a prime example of Hollywood drivel.  All glitz and glitter without much plot or dialogue or acting or things that one would consider substantive in a film.  The scenes with real people were far and few between the computer generated portions of the film.  In fact, nearly the entire film was made on a computer.  Some are pretty good, but most are over the top and one is rendered numb by the end.  The best scene is the one with two HUMAN females fighting.  And it's because they are human, not CG.  This is not a quality film and best left to the 13-year old kids that love this stuff.  A three out of ten.",3,0,0,12 May 2001
The Descent," What? This movie stinks. - 1 of 10
","This film doesn't have much going for it. The characters were uninteresting and bordered on the annoying. I enjoyed their fate when it finally came. Very few points of interest, which actually includes the premise. It's as if someone had a fairly neat idea and completely ruined it with the writing and directing. I really cannot imagine how or why this film has scored so highly. I felt that it warranted a rating of two or three, because of a couple of minor positive points, but I was coaxed to help drive the rating down from an outlandish seven point five. Yikes. I had to agree.This is one to avoid. At least don't pay to see it.1'ish of 10",1,16,31,6 August 2006
The Untouchables," Garbage. Overblown garbage. 4 of 10
","The music is over the top. The acting was tepid. The story was cheesy.  The dialogue was some of the worst I've ever heard.  How did Connery ever win an Oscar for this???  Ug.  It doesn't have many good points.  This film does not deserve a 7.8 in the slightest degree imaginable.  For most, it's too late to avoid this tripe, but this film should be re-voted to reflect the true measure of this Hollowood turkey.  4 of 10 at best.",3,7,19,30 August 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," Phew! I think I sat too close! - 6 of 10
","There is a lot going on in this film.  That's one of it's problems.  Much too much to follow and it only got worse.  Too many characters with too many agendas.  The dialogue was too pedestrian in parts and too complex in others.  Some performances were a bit stiff.  With that said, there are some good points:  Neo is back with the core cast.  There are some great fight scenes, fantastic special effects, funny moments, and did I mention the fantastic special effects?  Seeing it on the big screen is a must in my opinion, but you won't be _completely_ in awe of this film.  But you should like it well enough to go see the third... six of ten.",6,0,0,21 June 2003
Mystic River," Does not fulfill it's potential. - 6 of 10
","This film could've been much better than it was.  Somehow the actors missed their mark.  If you thought Penn was good in this, see '21 Grams' http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0315733/  He is far better in that film. 
Robbins' role seemed too fragmented to watch.  I believe that must've been Eastwood's intent, though.  Otherwise, I'd say his character was awful. Bacon and Fishburn do fine, but I was confused why Bacon's marital troubles were tossed in here.  Just to flesh out his character?  Okay, but it seemed a touch too much.  I didn't care.The premise?  Hometown justice meets 'organized' justice.  Big deal.  This film has an overblown rating.  6 of 10",6,0,1,26 July 2004
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Ug, what garbage. - 1 of 10
","Perhaps I'm just not a fan.  The first of the series was a decent film. Full of excitement and visual fun.  The second makes us sit and listen to way too much dialogue and not enough action.  It also introduces more hate/anger into the story, while the first spent little effort in this and it didn't need to.  We can see who the bad guys are easily enough.  How folks can tolerate this as good story telling, I'll never know.  The first was a 6+, but this one can't rise much above a one of ten.",1,5,11,21 July 2003
War of the Worlds," What...? Not great, but fun special FX. - 5 of 10
","Well, this one misses the mark slightly. Some implausible story turns cause some confusion on this one. I didn't understand why some things happened when they happened. Or why they happened at all. Character development should be more important to some film makers. *****Possible Spoiler Alert*****My main gripe, though, is that it's a premise of this film that they placed the Martian walking machines in the ground some while before the attack. With this in mind, I would think that there would have been a sampling of the Earth's microscopic life as that occurred. I just can't buy that they died from microbes in this scenario. The original did not propose this in my memory which makes the ending more plausible. Or did I miss something? This doesn't make much sense. Neither do a couple of other things, but I'll let them slide.Passable acting, no deep dialogue, but then, it's an action film. The action is sometimes slow, but there are some pretty good FX. All this adds up to 5 of 10. Maybe a fat five, but no better.",5,1,2,5 July 2005
Bruce Almighty," Yikes! One of Carey's worst. - 4 of 10
","I can't recommend this film.  Sure, it's got some laughs, but overall the plot is rife with holes.  Carey yucks it up some of the time, but it ain't enough to Carey this turkey!  Aniston and Carey are NOT a good on-screen couple and the prime drive of the film end up a love story.  I don't think so.  Ug, I could go on with all the problems with the plot, but why bother. See for yourself, if you like.  You'll laugh a time or two, but in the end, you'll wonder why Carey didn't do X number of other things while he was God. Then you'll stop by a church on the way home just to pray since they drilled this into your head at the end.  Eck, 4 of 10.",4,2,5,21 June 2003
Signs," Hmmm...disappointed. A 1950's fear of aliens film - 5 of 10
","I was a little disappointed with this film.  I expected more, but it really didn't offer much more than Day of the Triffids (http://us.imdb.com/Title?0055894), which I guess that was made in the 60's.  At least I could laugh more in that one; whatever.  There was some good suspense sprinkled about, but the kids were the best part of the film.  But don't go just for the kids!  Wait to see it discounted or for free or if it just happens to be on.",5,0,1,20 January 2003
Identity," Ehh. Not great, but not terrible - 5 of 10
","How this film got a rating over 7 mystifies me.  It's too scattered.  There are some good elements here, but none really get expounded upon.  The plot wasn't too hard to predict, but it wasn't until the halfway point that it was readily apparent.  Nice work with the twists early on, though, but there's almost too many.  The ending wasn't my cup-o-tea and it made me way more confused about the film.  For that, my rating sinks 1 point to a 5 of 10.",5,0,1,14 November 2003
Amélie," Fabulous it is. - 9 of 10
","This is a fantastic film in many ways.  The writing, story and dialogue are wonderful, but then there is the acting, editing, directing and cinematography.  Oi!  There is too much that is good about this film to tell you here.  See it for yourself and pick.  And lest I forget, Audrey Tautou is very charming as Amelie, but thankfully now I have not forgotten.",9,0,2,18 January 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Okay, it's good, but the CG and length are excessive. - 8 of 10
","I have enjoyed the LOTR trilogy as much as anyone, but the computer graphics got a bit out of hand for my tastes in this one.  The sets are fantastic, but they could've worked a little harder on the special effects to make them seem a bit more real.  Aside from that, I wonder how someone can easily breath sulfur gas, wonder why stories must be so tidy, and remember that intermissions are a good thing.  I loved the film, but a few things make it less powerful than the first (which I rank the best of the three), but a magnificent film and story, nonetheless.  Bring dinner and a pillow.  8 of 10",8,1,1,30 December 2003
