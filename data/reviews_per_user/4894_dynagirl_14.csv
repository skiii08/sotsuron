The Blair Witch Project," Hansel & Gretel revisited with terrifying realism
","The Blair Witch Project was, without a doubt, one of the most intense films produced in a very long time. It's documentary style not only gave it a real feel, but also allowed the audience to experience the entire story first hand. As the characters spiral into terror of unimaginable proportions, you take the journey right along with them.Story and character development are superb and the acting is surprisingly realistic. You'll actually have to remind yourself that it isn't a true story. But the nicest thing about this creepy little film is how much is left to your own imagination. With the massive budgets of most commercial films, we're so used to 'seeing' everything that nothing shocks the average movie goer anymore. In Blair Witch, it's what you DON'T see that really scares you.",10,1,2,1 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Ax Jar Jar and you've got a movie.
","Having read a number of critic reviews before seeing Phantom Menace, I was sort of expecting to be disappointed. But what I found instead was quite an enjoyable film. It was attractive to watch as well--the costuming was superb, the vehicles very stylized, and some of the scenes were just downright breathtaking.There were definitely some flaws. The acting was rather flat, with virtually no emotional pull at all. We really didn't get to know any of the characters except little Anakin (a writing & directing problem more than anything). But since this was Episode I, I suspect there will be considerably more character depth in the next installment (I hope, anyway).Another problem was with all the computer generated characters. I may be alone on this but, with the exception of the Battle Droids, they left a lot to be desired when compared to old fashioned puppetry (or even a guy in a costume). And speaking of computer generated characters...One can only pray that Jar Jar Binks meets with an untimely death before Episode II. I had been forewarned about this character, but in my wildest dreams I could never have imagined just how annoying he actually was. The film needed some humor, but Jar Jar just didn't cut it.I guess it sounds like I'm ripping this film apart, but I really did like it and would definitely recommend it. Maybe my low expectations helped!",7,0,1,20 May 1999
United 93," Powerful
","United 93 was nothing like I expected. It wasn't a slick Hollwood movie and it wasn't a sappy movie-of-the-week kind of thing. It was raw and intense and gripping. What the director seems to give us is as close to a real-time accurate account as possible. I didn't get the sense there was much embellishment and there are no unbelievable heroics. Instead, we see confusion and fear that lead to desperation, courage and incredible determination. The film spends as much time on the ground, in air traffic control towers and NORAD, as it does in the plane. But you really feel the drama, shock and utter chaos of that day from perspectives that you probably wouldn't expect. The really interesting thing is how much of the tension is created, not by the film, but by the viewer. You know what's going to happen, so every moment that it's not happening, reality is playing as this contrasting backdrop in your mind. It was a truly powerful film.",9,5,10,29 April 2006
Minority Report," Interesting, but tries a little too hard
","Steven Spielberg needs to stop trying so hard to make a masterpiece. Minority Report was a good movie, but it felt forced, obvious and even preachy some of the time. Social commentary should never be at the forefront of a film or itdetracts considerably from the story. A statement should be the subtext--the'read between the lines' part of a movie. But Spielberg seems to think it's the other way around: the social statement is your film and your characters andstory are just coming along for the ride. It just doesn't work well when you do that, though. When you overlook all that, there is something worth seeing here. It's nice to look at, displays a dizzying array of gee-whiz futuristic gadgetry and, of course, you've got Tom Cruise. So, you know, it's not bad.",7,0,0,2 July 2002
Training Day," Nice looking, well directed GARBAGE
","If, like me, you passed up Training Day in the theater because youthought it looked stupid, but after Denzel Washington won the BestActor Oscar, you thought about renting it because, you know,maybe it's not so bad, then DO NOT RENT THIS MOVIE!I'm by no means a movie snob. I can appreciate a nice, slick,Hollywood film. But Training Day is the epitome of bad scripting.The characters are painfully cliched and the story is completelyunbelievable--the movie is just plain awful... painfully awful. As forDenzel Washington's character, well, think John Travolta in BrokenArrow.",2,33,69,4 April 2002
Insomnia," Dull, dreary and s-l-o-w
","I'm not one to knock a good drama, but this movie was simply not enjoyable. It's a decent enough story and certainly the performances are excellent, but thepresentation is too bland and subdued. The style of the film would seem to be intentional to sort of punctuate Al Pacino's character's perspective (he's astressed out cop with insomnia), but that's just not enough to keep the viewer interested. The plot itself is actually pretty simple and straightforward, so the fact that it feels so long and drawn out is inexcusable.",5,0,1,2 July 2002
L.A. Confidential," A brilliant piece of work
","This is without a doubt, one of the most intelligent films to come out of Hollywood in quite some time. The script is masterful, with intrigue and rich, three dimensional characters. They have such history and meaning that their motives are abundantly clear, without being too obvious. Even Kim Bassinger did an outstanding job (her Oscar was much deserved).It really is a beautiful film to watch, too. Everything from the color to the wardrobe, help give this film it's voice and immerse you in the story . Few films pull viewers into their period with such realism as LA Confidential.",10,1,1,6 February 1999
The Bourne Identity," Disappointing and Typical
","After a solid and intriguing opening (about the first 30 minutes), Bourne Identity deteriorates into a rather typical thriller. That might not be so bad; but because it leads you to believe you're in for something good--something a little different than your run of the mill Hollywood chase flick--it's a major disappointment. There's simply no suspense created and no surprise as to how this movie ends. Yawn.",5,1,2,2 July 2002
Saving Private Ryan," Most over-rated movie of our time.
","Let's begin with the 'in your face' gore. Guts on film don't bother me and I'm sure it was historically accurate. But as a movie, it played out like a predictable horror film after the first few heart-pumping minutes. Who didn't see it coming from a mile away when a guy Tom Hanks is dragging gets blown in half? Pure shock value, not story value.Also, the film doesn't look good. From scene to scene we endure a barrage of styles--everything from choppy POV (whose?) to grand panoramics. I assume the drastic changes in cinematography are meant to represent character experience, but I found them a major distraction to becoming absorbed in the film.Characters are poorly defined and even stereotypical: the hothead who doesn't want to follow orders, the 98 lb. weakling who's never shot a gun. We've never seen those before! The only thing that really surprised me was that he didn't find his 'inner strength' by the end.The modern-day bookends were quite bothersome as well. This device rarely works because it does nothing more than hinder the audience from being in the moment. I also had a VERY hard time empathizing with the character who appears in those scenes (I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't yet seen it). We're not given a reason to believe he would feel so strongly later in life, so I simply couldn't share in his drama.There were certainly some great moments in the film, especially in the final battle sequence--the stabbing death of one of the soldiers, and another shooting at a tank with his pistol in desperation. Overall though, the film just didn't flow and I wasn't drawn in.I think audiences are confusing what they think was a shockingly realistic war movie with what was actually just plain shocking for a Spielberg movie. For a good war movie, I'll take Platoon anyday.",5,0,1,4 February 1999
Men in Black II," Light, fun, enjoyable
","After reading about MIB2, I was expecting it to be really lame (let's face it, most sequels are), but I was pleasantly surprised by this. No, it's not as good as the first one. Partly, that's because there's no real surprise--we already knoweverything and so do the characters. There is some attempt to recapture the fun intro of the first movie by having J return to the agency, but that fails incomparison to K's enlistment last time. What MIB2 amounts to is really just a new assignment for our MIB guys. And sadly, Linda Fiorentino is absent fromthe cast. We do get the worm guys and the talking dog again, though (even ifhe's a bit over-used). Overall, MIB2 is done well enough to be fun and enjoyable without feeling like a second-rate rehash.",6,0,0,2 July 2002
Mission: Impossible II," Fun action movie, not much more
","Don't go looking for a masterpiece and you'll like MI2. It'syour basic action movie, with fun techno-gadgets, greatexplosions and some intense fight sequences. Sure thereare ridiculous and unbievable moments, but all-in-all it's agood ride.",7,0,0,11 September 2000
Pulp Fiction," Pulp Directing
","Quentin Tarantino should have his director's license revoked (or at least be banned from the editing room) for this awful piece of garbage. The movie as a whole was a hack job of mismatched scenes, purely designed to hide the flimsiness of the story and mask the crudity of his directing.The film has some masterful stand alone scenes and Tarantino should have stopped there. His calling is short films, not features. Even the superb acting (no, not you Quentin) can save this 'film.'",4,6,15,4 February 1999
Scream," The intellectual slasher flick...
","Cleverly scripted and surprisingly full of suspense, this is one horror movie that really leaves all others in the dust. Even the first Nightmare on Elm Street can't compare.What this film does, above all else, is renounce the cliches of horror movies past. There are, of course, a few moments of digression when you know what's coming and who's going to get it next. But for the most part, this one really keeps you on your toes, rather than yelling 'don't go in there!' at the screen.Scream is certainly bloody, so it's not for the squeamish. But if you've ever seen even one slasher film, you'll really get a kick (and a scream) out of this.",9,0,0,6 February 1999
Blow," Leave after 90 minutes and you'll love it
","Blow is a rather good film until about 2/3 of the way in. It's stylish, well-paced and thoroughly engaging. But then it takes a major dive. The problem isn't so much with the story, but rather with the presentation of it. It's just completely unbalanced, losing it's pace and direction in that last third. Granted, it's based on a true story, but that's no excuse for the dull, s-l-o-w, hum-drum final scenes director Ted Demme throws at us.",7,0,0,8 April 2001
