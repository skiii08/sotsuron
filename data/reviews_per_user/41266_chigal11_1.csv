National Treasure: Book of Secrets," OK, but not as intense as the first
","This was clearly dumbed down for the younger audience. Lacked the intensity, mystery and danger of the first. Followed the treasure hunt approach, but the girlfriend and Riley had little true power. Nor did the FBI really have much power. Helen was a good addition and could be used in future stories. And definitely left an opening for another sequel.Never did resolve the accusation and truth behind it all. Wimped out on the rationale behind the hunt for the Treasure.Raise it back to PG13 at least and look at Indiana Jones as a model for what could be done.",8,0,1,23 December 2007
