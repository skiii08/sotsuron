Your Name.," Over-rated but good
","Granted that i have watched only a few anime movies in my life, but this is surely over-rated. It is good however and kept my attention. Te reviews are correct, but almost 9/10? That is a bridge too far.If the Hollywood types are remaking I can already tell it will fail.",7,15,20,25 January 2020
Murder on the Orient Express," Boring
",Simple as that. It was boring. This film was not exciting. There was no flash of brilliance. There was no action. There was no pretty woman.I think ere is the bottom-line: this film already existed. They had shot it and filmed it before. Why make another one?,2,7,12,25 January 2020
