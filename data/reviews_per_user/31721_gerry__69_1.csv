Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Why do people hate this movie?
","In a recent interview, George Lucas was asked about how it felt to have one of his films loathed by so many people.  His response was that it was the highest grossing Star Wars film thus far, so the naysayers must be a very vocal minority.  Instead of sidestepping this issue, I hope to convince people that _The Phantom Menace_ is just as good as any of the other Star Wars films.Look at _A New Hope_ for example.  It stylistically rhymes with _Menace_. It had a linear story, character and plot set-up, plodding action with a few bright points, but it had to.  In order for Ep. V and VI to succeed, we had to be introduced and familiar with the characters already.Episode one does this as well--it is a one track story, very simplistic in design, but it's purpose is greater than the story of _the Phantom Menace_. It's only real duty is to set up the characters, plotlines, and locales for the next two films.That isn't to say that Episode I isn't entertaining.  The pod race is fun, the climactic lightsaber duel between Obi-Wan, Qui-Gon and Darth Maul is beyond anything Star Wars audiences have seen before, and the characters are fun to watch on screen.When all is said and done, Star Wars: Episode I:  The Phantom Menace is not a brilliant film, but neither were any of the other Star Wars movies.  It is an entertaining popcorn flick with lots of action, and that is all a Star Wars movie needs to be.",Null,1,2,28 May 2002
