United 93," Propaganda
","The US government controlling Hollywood to put out a film based completely on lies in an attempt to convince the public that 911 was a terrorist attack rather than a false flag to get support to invade Iraq.
Disgusting at best and an insult to the souls murdered on that day.",1,3,12,26 January 2019
Knives Out," Slow
","30 minutes into movie and I'm playing with my phone.
Sub par acting. Terrible accents.

Trying way to hard with camera angles.
Cluedo...but way way more boring.
Colonel Mustard in the library with a candlestick.
Maybe it will improve after 30 minutes. Can't say.
Better things to do.",2,6,10,21 February 2020
