Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not as good as the hype made it out to be.....
","To say the least all the publicity here in California made 'Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace' look like it was 'The Movie of The Millennium!'  There was a lot of loose ends, they were trying to reach too much of the populous.  From a kids point of view it wouldn't make a lot of sense, (i.e., the political side of the Monarchy) then from an adults view there wasn't a strong plot either ..... Well maybe Next time they'll spend more time on the basics than money on the art.....",Null,0,0,4 September 1999
