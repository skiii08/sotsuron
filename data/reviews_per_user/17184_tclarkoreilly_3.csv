The Avengers," Wish I could avenge the 2.5 hours and $20 wasted on this
","I really enjoy some comic book movies - 'Spiderman 2' and the first 'X-Men' are excellent in my opinion. But I'm completely baffled by the high ratings given 'The Avengers'. The dialog is stupid, most of the costumes really lame, the story line completely predictable and good lord but the clich√©s run rampant. The 'super-villain' has a British accent - that's about all you need to know about this movie. Most of the acting was completely forgettable or, in the case of Samuel L Jackson, just plain god-awful. If it weren't for Robert Downey and Mark Ruffalo, I don't know how I could give this more than one star. As I was suffering through this awful thing my mind kept drifting to 'Mystery Men' and how much better and funnier it is!",3,12,28,13 May 2012
First Man," Lack of realism detracts from the reality of the actual events
","Overall I am disappointed by this movie, which tries to be docudrama. While visually spectacular, it often fails to depict the environment of space realistically.Some of those scenes are beautiful and great (lunar module Eagle gliding serenely in lunar orbit) - but other key scenes fail miserably, if you know what the reality is like. Many of the scenes set in the vacuum of space (not inside the ship) have explosive and whooshing sounds. The director is trying to make it more 'exciting', but it's not exciting to me if I know it's not real. A few movies have gotten around the 'space is silent' quandary in imaginative ways - 'Gravity' used extremely effective music to go along with soundless explosions, '2001' used the sound of breathing as the astronaut drifted through the void.The lunar landscape is depicted as ridiculously craggy and extremely steep, especially at Apollo 11's landing site. At one point Armstrong walks up to a crater, which looks like a deep black well. Silly and phony-looking. The craters and slopes on the real Moon are almost always very gentle and lunar terrain has been softened and sandblasted by micrometeoroids for billions of years,The Earth is depicted as a crescent during the Apollo 11 EVA, when actually it was gibbous on July 20, 1969. You might say that's a very minor nitpick, but the movie presents itself as a docudrama - displaying technical sloppiness with no regard for realism.",6,13,23,12 October 2018
Prometheus," There must be a space pony in here somewhere!
","As many others have pointed out, 'Prometheus' is visually spectacular yet fails miserably on a story-telling and acting level. The story lurches clumsily from one disconnected 'surprise' to another, to no point at all (epitomized by the 'surprise' of Vickers' paternity - why the hell do we care???) The characters act in completely unrealistic and stupid ways, and represent the shallow one-dimensional stereotypes we've come to expect from 'B-grade' science fiction movies (the brash risk-taking scientist, the tattooed in-your-face Limey with attitude, the world-weary ship's company-man pilot, just doin' his job...). There is virtually no development of these idiotic stereotypes. Amazingly, there is no real suspense, beyond the premature discharge of an accordion (I wish I were making this up, but I am not). There are plenty of lame attempts at suspense that don't work (exploding alien head, fake rubbery-looking cobra beast, ridiculous robo-surgery scene). All of these detract fatally from the movie as a whole - this thing is actually painful to watch! And yet I see that some claim that 'Prometheus' is a misunderstood masterpiece like '2001', if only we'd look beneath the surface of horrible scripting to find its 'deeper meaning'. Yes, 'Prometheus' is a lot like '2001', except that 'Prometheus' sucks and I hated it. Ye gods, '2001' was sublime and mysterious where 'Prometheus' is a tangled, reeking mess of botched writing and editing. Truly sad to see the director of 'Alien', 'Blade Runner' and 'Gladiator' reduced to this garbage. Move along folks, nothing to see here...",3,11,18,21 June 2012
