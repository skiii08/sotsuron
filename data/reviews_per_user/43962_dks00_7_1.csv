Mission: Impossible III," Sorry - I liked it
","People: It is what it is - a popcorn movie! It is not an Oscar winner (FX maybe) so give Tom a break.Tommy-boy is a nut, but I liked this movie for what it is.Hoffman was awesome as the villain. The scene where he is running down the list of things he said he would do to before Ethan dies was awesome.Although the party scene looked like a Felicity reunion scene, but I let it go.Simon Pegg's nervous Brit bit was great.Michelle Monaghan played a great 'wife in danger, but steps it up when needed and kills the bad guy'. I know that in real life she would sue for divorce and take half of his stuff, but Julia adapts well to her husband being a silent killer.",7,1,3,10 May 2006
