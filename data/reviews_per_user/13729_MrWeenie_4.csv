It," Overwrought and Ridiculous
","It might have been better but the music was terribly awkward throughout and really ruined it. Also, I don't think that it was as effective at being scary as the original, either, because it relied a bit on too much on camera tricks and CGI. Although acting between the kids was usually good, the grownup actors generally weren't picked or directed as carefully and typically were bad. It's biggest problem was that the dialogue was sometimes unnatural and unconvincing. It probably still could have been a six star movie for me with minor changes, but as is, it's a five. IT wasn't quite worth my time.",5,1,2,28 August 2019
Prometheus," Surprisingly Not Good.
","This movie created some problems for itself. Sometimes its digital animation was overdone, squandering pivotal action sequences by making them seem ridiculous. Also, some ideas were recycled, such as the suspicious android, the likes of which anyone who watched 'Aliens' will find either too familiar or too predictable. Additionally, acting was infrequently bad. One example of that is Elba's poor American accent. His character had shipmates with non American accents. He could have kept his natural way of talking and the film would have been better for it. Not least of all among the movie's many failures and clich√©s, its on screen romantic relationships were goofy and/or disgusting.Its basic plot may have been decent enough on its own to earn a pass, but that had to clear all of the hurdles which this movie's makers created for themselves, in order for the movie to still seem good in the end. My feeling is that it does not quite do that. It seems okay, maybe even pretty okay, but ultimately, it is not quite a film well done.",5,0,0,9 March 2015
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Even for a Star Wars Movie, It was Bad
","Some awful casting, bad acting especially by John Boyega, weak character development, and it relied on Star Wars cliches rather than a good original story.",2,11,15,6 May 2019
Life," Not A Waste Of Time, But Still Forgettable
","Its dialogue sometimes seems more well suited for its target audience than for its characters. Actually, fairly often it doesn't seem to fit the characters at all. Also, I think that it failed to grab me at a few pivotal plot points. For example, instead of being drawn in by certain scenes which were meant to be very tense, instead I found myself paying more attention to devises such as the music in such scenes. So, it wasn't a seamless movie watching experience. However, I like science fiction horror, and there were some things I liked about this picture. Still, ultimately, while I don't feel like it was a complete waste of time, I feel like it's basically forgettable. 5.4/10",5,1,6,26 March 2017
