Despicable Me 2," Best Movie Ever!!!!!
",I think my husband & I were as excited to see this movie as our girls. My husband left work early to come see the movie with us. The first is a family favorite that we watch all the time. Boy did it deliver I think it was even better than the first which Never happens. The entire audience was laughing out loud the entire movie. I.m so glad they waited to make sure the next movie was equal quality or better. And it's better. I don't want to say anything to give anything away. Except to go see it bring the kids bring the parents they will love it. I won't be surprised if this ends up being one of the most popular movies of all time.,10,1,6,3 July 2013
