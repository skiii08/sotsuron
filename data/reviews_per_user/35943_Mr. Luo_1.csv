Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," What the heck was that ??
","Well, There I was ... bored. George Lucas had a chance to create something really great here, and dropped the ball. The effects were really good, the pod race was awesome, and the lightsaber duel was really good as well. The rest of the movie was the problem.Where do I start .. The dialog, pacing, Jar Jar, the plot, the kid, the 'acting', the 'Ewok Factor'. I was waiting for Howard The Duck to make a cameo. That way Lucas can sell that action figure as well..I just came out of the theatre with a negative attitude about the whole thing.",2,0,1,21 May 1999
