Skyfall," Up there with the best but...
","I really liked this Bond. I liked what the producers were trying to do with Quantum and thought that Casino was overrated. Been there seen that, albeit with different actors. QoS had style but was badly fragmented. Skyfall delivers on the potential that casting Daniel Craig offers. This is not Bourne reborn, this is Bond reborn. Hiring Sam Mendes was a very smart move and the film feels a little more grown up, a little more intelligent as a result. It's also visually very stylish in an understated way. Berenice Marlohe rather than Famke Jansen. It's by no means perfect. The last reel has 'let's keep within budget' written all over it and that's a shame. Destroying an isolated house in the Scottish highlands smells of cheap and all the press-fed justification re Bond's childhood is bullshit. This was a budgetary decision and the film suffers as a result. That said, it's still one of the best. There are signs of too many cooks at work. Lines like 'I never did like the house' belong to another Bond and point to a loss of nerve but Sam Mendes and Daniel Craig have finally laid the ghost of Connery.",7,0,3,27 January 2013
Public Enemies," Soulless
","Even Miami Vice had something that inspired me to revisit it, even if that revisit only confirmed my suspicions. Nonetheless, it offered a sense of greatness missed, in a lesser variation on the way that Heaven's Gate does. Public Enemies offers none of this. It's not a disaster. It is exactly what it seems to be, and that's its problem. Subtext, never a big part of a Michael Mann movie, is MIA here. The other problem is the choice of medium. This is the first film I've seen which has made me question the use of digital photography. Here it grates. It's a modern medium. Here, in a movie steeped in the 1930s, it throws you out of the moment, time after time. There are good performances, the cinematography's appropriate, the script's adequate but the whole fails to achieve anything beyond the sum of its parts. Blah.",6,0,0,27 May 2012
Midnight in Paris," Lazy and simplistic
","I've enjoyed some of Allen's recent films, as he works his way round Europe, gently and sometimes not so gently lampooning Americans and their unattractive habits and mores. Vicky Christina Barcelona was the high point of this series, subtle and beguiling and beautifully observed. By contrast, Midnight in Paris is a heavy-handed disappointment. It starts badly, with a pointless sequence of shots of the city, improves when we meet our hero, his shrewish fianc√©e and her appalling parents and then utterly fails to deliver on its very cute premise. The script is unfinished and never gets beyond its saccharine sweetness to tackle the philosophical and metaphysical questions that the premise poses. There were moments to be enjoyed in the casting and sometimes the action but the clumsy writing cut them short almost every time. It says a lot about a film when even Marion Cotillard fails to inject any real depth into her character. Lazy and simplistic, as are the critics and audiences that praised it so highly.",5,0,1,23 May 2012
Zulu," Myth and reality
","Time hasn't been kind to Zulu. I saw it when it first came out. I was thirteen or fourteen at the time and I enjoyed it. It had a certain Boy's Own appeal and (as I thought at the time) some decent action sequences. It was, and is, in many ways a British Alamo. Almost half a century on, the faults are manifest and glaring. I watched it recently on bluray on a 106' screen. Not quite as it was meant to be seen but close. Off topic, the bluray PQ is as bad as most knowledgeable critics have said. DNR and edge enhancement are glaring to the point of distraction. I haven't seen anything that bad since the bluray of The Italian Job, coincidentally another Michael Caine film. On to the film itself. The script is adequate. It restricts itself to a very limited perspective and that's a choice. I don't know but I hope that it's historically accurate because that's the only justification for such a narrow POV. The cinematography is flat. It takes talent to make Africa look boring, to miss the contrasts between the land and its natives and invaders, the sweeping views and the claustrophobia of the mission. I wondered what Vilmos Zsigmond might have done with it. The acting varies from good enough, Stanley Baker and Nigel Green, to hopeless mugging by the rest, led from the front by Jack Hawkins. Michael Caine is miscast as a British officer. The direction is borderline school play, with some shockingly badly realised scenes. Watch Stanley Baker et al stand around impotently as Hawkins persuades forty native soldiers to desert. The fight scenes are worse. I lost track of the number of spear or bayonet impalings where you could see that the blade was beyond the target body. Like The Alamo, this seems to have been a labour of love, with Stanley Baker standing in for John Wayne. I suspect that the budget was less than The Alamo's $12m but that doesn't explain the amateurish feel of the enterprise. It also doesn't explain the film's standing today. For all its political agenda, Tony Richardson's Charge of the Light Brigade is a far, far better film but you wouldn't know it from current reviews. 6 out of 10 for old times' sake.",6,1,9,26 August 2012
The Favourite," Wickedly entertaining and accurate depiction of an unwelcome menage a trois
","Firstly, this is not for simple palates. It lacks obvious dramatic moments and the kind of crowd-pleasing finale that the cousins seem to need. In their place, the film offers endless nuance, psychological and emotional truth and an ending that perfectly fits the story as told. And it packages all of that in a deceptively simple movie. And deception is the word here. This is like Liaisons Dangereuses for real people.
The cast, Rachel Weisz, Emma Stone and Olivia Colman all bring their considerable A game to a very smart and very witty script. The cinematography is spot-on and the music is idiosyncratic and sheer perfection.
Of course, all these attributes inevitably limit the film's audience. I imagine that showings outside the big coastal cities of the US will be less than enthusiastically welcomed but that's a very small and unavoidable price to pay. If you got past third grade and have an IQ in triple digits, buy a ticket now.
A footnote for those who gave the movie a poor or worse rating: because you lack the education, breadth of vision or humanity to understand what's really a very simple story, don't blame the film, the actors or the filmmaker. Look to yourself. Recognize this opportunity to become a fuller, more complete human being. Learn to read.",8,3,5,15 February 2019
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," No-one ever went broke underestimating... etc.
","Lea Sedoux and Jeremy Renner bring a depth to their characters that's at odds with every other aspect of this film. It's an expensive cartoon and if that's what you want, then you'll be quite happy. If, on the other hand, you're over twelve or have an IQ into triple digits, you're in for a disappointment. Moderately smart ten year olds should not waste their (parents') money. It has its moments but they're lost in a welter of ill-judged humor, preposterous stunts and worse plot devices. The first half hour or so is particularly bad as it becomes clearer and clearer that no one has any clue what kind of a film they're making. I didn't think it could get any worse - and then Tom Wilkinson turned up! Thankfully, it's only a cameo role and the film starts to improve. Some of the Dubai stuff is really quite good but then it begins to get silly again. MI was almost in Third Man territory for it's first twenty minutes or so. MI3 proved that the franchise works well as a James Bond alternative, offering a similar mix of locations, glamour, action, beautiful women and fast cars. I wonder what MI5 will bring. By the way, the acronyms are getting confusing. IMF, MI5? A John le Carre financial thriller?",6,5,8,22 April 2012
Sherlock Holmes," Oh dear!
","It's not terrible, just another lazy blockbuster. Casting Robert Downey as Holmes isn't a bad idea. And reminding audiences that Holmes wasn't entirely cerebral, that he was an accomplished boxer, is a legitimate way of broadening his character and his appeal. But Downey isn't a natural Holmes. He needs foils to bring out his edge or he seems too playful, too Wildian. The foils provided are not up to the job and the result is a lazy, disappointing film. It looks wonderful. Its re-creation of late Victorian London is convincing without being too realistically grimy. Very Hollywood but it works. The plot is adequate without ever challenging its intended audience. The problems lie in a script so anodyne that even Mark Strong can't overcome the villain's cardboard cutout qualities, in two crucial casting errors and finally in the over-reliance on action, for which read fight, scenes. Jude Law is much, much too bland as Watson. There's not enough contrast with Holmes. He's neither sufficiently irritating nor sufficiently irritated and it denies Downey's Holmes a proper frame. The result is a sort of buddy movie. Those issues pale into insignificance when we come to the casting of Rachel McAdams as Irene Adler. Who in God's name thought this was a good idea? McAdams is a good little actress and cast as a pretty little housemaid on the make, she might have done a decent job. But as Irene Adler, a woman smart enough and tough enough to thrive in that world, with an intellect to match Holmes' and a strength of character to make her irresistible to him? You've got to be kidding. All of which is probably why there are so many fight scenes. Without those, even the intended audience might notice the flaws. If you have a brain, don't waste your time on this. Watch BBC TV's recent Sherlock instead and see how it should be done. There are six of those, each one a feature length episode and the sixth is even better than the first.",5,0,1,7 May 2012
Vanilla Sky," Glossy but emotionally subpar remake
","I revisited Vanilla Sky recently. I wondered if my early impressions of the film might be ripe for revision. In one way they were. I came away from my second viewing with a clearer idea of the film's strengths and weaknesses. Vanilla Sky begins with a disadvantage. It's an almost frame by frame remake of the hugely successful and widely admired Spanish film Abre Los Ojos and so actively invites comparison. That's been done and I can't add anything meaningful to the debate. But since Vanilla Sky was made, there has been a rash of similarly themed movies, books and (in Britain at least) radio plays. Judged by these standards, the movie fares quite well. It's beautifully made. Everything and everyone looks wonderful. The girls in particular are perfectly cast and bring serious emotional power to their scenes. If you don't think Cameron Diaz can act, take a look at her scene with Cruise in the car. It'll send shivers up and down your spine. But that emotional punch is ultimately what the film lacks. It's the missing ingredient and the fault lies with Cruise. As the rich and impossibly charming playboy inheritee of his daddy's publishing empire, he's note perfect. Of course. Tom Cruise has made a career out of knowing his strengths and is rightly the most commercially successful actor of the last few decades. There's no denying his commitment to his craft and what serious actor could resist the lure of Charles Laughton's crown as the king of prosthetic pathos but it's the undoing of this film. All the training, all the practice, all the sheer willpower in the world cannot prepare you for a role like this. And that's the point. The role is pivotal and Cruise is not the actor to invest it with a full emotional life. Frankly, it's hard to think who would have been a better choice. Without Cruise, the film might never have been made and anyway, he's not the movie's only problem. Kurt Russel's responsible for some cringeworthy mugging, better suited to a bad daytime soap. Would I rather the film hadn't been made? No, it brought the story to a wider audience and has its own strengths. I doubt that it will be remade any time soon but if it were, I wonder what Tom Hardy would make of that central role.",6,0,1,4 February 2015
Flight," Welcome to Hollywood
","The first 45 minutes of 'Flight' are breathtakingly good. Sure, the opening scene might have been exhibit A in Jennifer Jason Leigh's reasonable assertion that women are there (in movies)to make the stars look heterosexual. But then the film takes off (pun utterly intended) and those thoughts are lost in the appreciation for the artistry on show, as are the thoughts that questioned a modern airliner's ability to survive inversion. Did you see the TU144 accident at the Paris airshow? And then we reach the (Samuel)Becket-like scene in the hospital stairwell and you're wondering why this film didn't make history. The answer comes quickly as we watch Denzel Washington descend into a cartoon character of an addict and stay there for the next ninety minutes. Hollywood (and America) will probably never get over its obsessions with addiction and redemption but everyone needs to find a new way of expressing it. The final scene in which Denzel tells a group of fellow-inmates that being banged up for ten years is the best thing that could have happened to him is beyond ridiculous. The sad thing is that there was a great film to be had here. The exploration of the tension between the various vested interests after an air crash as well as the real moral dilemmas posed were touched on but never explored. Business as usual for mainstream Hollywood. Shame on you all.",6,0,0,29 January 2013
