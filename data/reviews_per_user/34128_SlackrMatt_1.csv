The Ring," Great story...poorly done
","I saw 'The Ring' expecting this grandios production of horror. Unfortunately for me, the horror in 'The Ring' was the fact that there was no horror if you took out the loud noises. Any film will be scary if you slap in a loud bang after the entire theatre has gone dark and silent. It's a trick movie folks like to use to make it seem like you jumped at something frightening when all it was was someone tapping another person on the back. Someday soon I hope someone produces a film that's ACTUALLY scary. Until then, I guess 'The Ring' will have to do. Once again, it was an all right movie but with the great story that it did have, it could've been so much better.",Null,0,0,3 November 2002
