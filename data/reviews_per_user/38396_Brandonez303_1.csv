Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Too Much Talking?
","I really enjoyed Kill Bill Vol.1 because of its over the top music, violence, and directing. Kill Bill Vol. 2 was good, but my only complaint about the film was the extended dialog. It seemed as if Tarantino was trying to fill space and extend the length of the movie. The main scenes were with Budd at the strip club and the dialog between Bill and Uma Thurman before the final fight. The sometimes pointless dialog made parts of the movie boring and quite un-enjoyable. Maybe I'm missing some greater meaning or underlying message, but overall it just made me think less of the movie. I would enjoy to hear your thoughts and comments on the subject.",7,0,1,16 March 2006
