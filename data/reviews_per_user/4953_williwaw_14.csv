Skyfall," Daniel Craig is a Star!
","Daniel Craig is the best James Bond ever and is superb in this movie made by MGM and Columbia.Superb support by Ralph Fiennes and the peerless Judi Dench, but it is Daniel Craig's movie all the way. A real movie star. Tough, Elegant, and a certified Leading Man. Javier Barden is wickedly fun in a role very much a departure. I enjoyed this movie and it is one I could see over and over again.Run don't walk to see Daniel Craig as James Bond in Skyfall. I am dismayed this fine film which has already racked up gross of over $1 Billion and likely to end up in the top 5 of all time when the final grosses are counted did not receive Oscar noms for Craig, Dench and Barden.",10,1,7,12 January 2013
Brokeback Mountain," Film Masterpiece
","Director Ang Lee creates a spellbinding movie about two Men who fall in love. The movie is set in the West and using cowboys as a metaphor for masculinity, Star Heath Ledger was robbed of an Oscar for one of the truly great performances and Jake Gyllenhal is superb as Jack and should have won Best Supporting Actor. Tastefully done, it will surprise those who think they are going to see hardcore scenes, because there are none. Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway give splendid support but the film belongs to the two Leading Men who are brilliant actors. Superior film, and deserves to be ranked as one of the finest films of recent years.Sometimes Oscar gets it wrong, 'Brokeback Mountain' was the best movie of the year and should have won the Oscar.I recommend this great brave filmWilliwaw",10,8,8,12 June 2011
The Best Years of Our Lives," Wyler, Loy, March, Andrews Masterpience
","William Wyler the Director of such classics as Wuthering Heights, Mrs. Miniver, Little Foxes, Jezebel, The Letter returned from the Military Service in WWII and created a film classic, a Masterpiece. Produced by the Independent Studio of Samuel Goldwyn this film is brilliantly acted by a cast of true artists Myrna Loy, Frederic March, Dana Andrews among many others. One cannot praise the ensemble cast enough, and kudos to sexy Virignia Mayo, and two standouts: Teresa Wright and Harold Russell. I am a Veteran myself but of a later war but found the similarities of the treatment given returning WWII Veterans and those of Vietnam and Desert Storm very powerful. Great black and white photography and a beautiful musical score add to the picture. Starting with its evocative title The Best Years of Our Lives is one of the finest films I have ever seen. March, Wright and Russell won Oscars, as well as Mr. Goldwyn, Mr Wyler and the Picture. Deservedly so! Ms. Loy top billed has a small but very pivotal role and is magnificent.A Great MoviePS The Reunion scene between March and Ms.Loy is one of the finest scenes in any movie ever!",10,3,3,31 May 2011
Quantum of Solace," Splendid Bond Film Starring Daniel Craig
","Quantum of Solace is the darkest of the James Bond films and surely of the 3 starring Daniel Craig the most serious. I enjoyed the film principally due to the charismatic performance of Daniel Craig, now my favorite male film star who plays James Bond I feel as Ian Flemming wrote the character, that is tough, and at the same time impossibly elegant and charming. A Man's Man.The filming of South American locales enjoyable Judi Dench as M is once again brilliant and I cannot think of any other actress who could do what Ms. Dench does with the role of M.Some do not like this film, I do. and I do most of all for the star presence of Mr. Craig",9,0,3,14 January 2013
Gone with the Wind," David Selznick's Film Masterpiece
","Irene Mayer Selznick wrote when the titles of this film appeared on the screen during the sneak preview of this great film she wept and could not stop crying. Deeply Mrs. Selznick knew that David Selznick bet all on this film, that he was obsessed with the film and that in a way He loved it more than David Selznick loved his wife. When one thinks of 1939 and the way this Film advanced film, that Selznick took a civil war story and made it the most famous and possibly one of the greatest films of all time, perhaps the American screen has regressed since 1939. Nowadays all we get is too much Special Effects.Casting Scarlett O Hara, Selznick built up a PR frenzy among the public as great stars such as Norma Shearer, Katharine Hepburn, Jean Arthur were mentioned as well as then newcomers Susan Hayward and Lana Turner. Bette Davis went to her grave wishing she had been cast as Scarlett. Other stars tested were Lucille Ball, Joan Benneet and Paulette Goddard who looked like the likely selection until one night Vivien Leigh appeared on the Selznick back lot. From then on Vivien Leigh 'became' Scarlett O Hara and gave one of the screen's greatest performances and won the Academy Award.Superbly produced by David Selznick at Selznick International and released thru then mighty MGM, and directed by Vincent Flemming, Gone With The Wind is one of the greatest films of all time and indexed for inflation, the biggest moneymaker of all time. George Cukor had been Director but Selznick fired Cukor. In retrospect a wise move as I do not think Cukor could have directed the action and Civil War battle scenes as Flemming did.Clark Gable is a dashing and great Rhett Butler, and splendid support by Olivia De Havilland Leslie Howard with a peerless performance by Hattie McDaniel who infuses soul into her great performance and justly won the Oscar. Costumes, Set and Art Direction, Cinematography are all tops with a thrilling score. This movie advanced the picture making into a modern era. David Selznick ever the gambler won his gamble, but would soon lose his wife due to his affair with Jennifer Jones. And ironically while creating the second greatest female star of her era (after the great Garbo), Vivien Leigh and David Selznick never made another movie together. Irene Selznick's powerful tears were momentous not only for the success of this film, the impending failure of her marriage and Selznick's eventual decline.Film scholars should read 'Memo From David O Selznick' -one of the most intensive books ever on the life of DOS and 'Showman' by David Thomson for more info on Gone With The Wind",10,1,1,25 July 2011
Lawrence of Arabia," Masterpiece
","Sam Spiegel who began his career as 'Sam P Eagle' reverted to his birth name and produced some of the greatest films of the 50's: The African Queen, The Wild One, Bridge On The River Kwai and Suddenly Last Summer. Spiegel's greatest triumph would come with this film in a new decade the 1960's. Columbia Pictures gave Spiegel's great discretion as he worked from London under his Horizon Film's banner. Stars like Brando, Hepburn, Bogart, Taylor, Clift, were in Speigel's films. Taking the story of T E Lawrence, Sam Spiegel once again joined forces with His great collaborator on The Bridge on River Kawi David Lean and together they made in my assessment the finest film of all time 'Lawrence Of Arabia'.Casting Peter O Toole after Marlon Brando declined the role, Lean and Spiegel created a worldwide star and to me O'Toole's Lawrence is the finest performance I have ever seen from an male star. (Gloria Swanson's Sunset Blvd gets my vote as best femme performance). O Toole while nominated lost the Oscar to Gregory Peck. (Jack Lemmon's searing Days of Wine And Roses was also nominated)Maurice Jarre created a memorable score, one of the best if not best ever. David Lean assembled a cast of Alec Guinness, Jack Hawkins, Anthony Quinn and in a star making performance, Omar Sharif. One cannot praise this film enough, including the magical photography in the desert, and the performance of a lifetime from Peter O Toole.I consider this the finest film I have ever seenWilliwaw",10,2,5,25 July 2011
Lincoln," Daniel Day Lewis Towering Performance
","Daniel Day Lewis becomes Abraham Lincoln in this splendid film directed by Steven Spielberg. A sure Oscar winner! I liked Tommy Lee Jones in this film but feel Sally Field was too old and perhaps too arch as Mary Todd Lincoln. The role of Mary Todd Lincoln has intrigued actresses over the years and one of the roles that Bette Davis tried to get Jack Warner to film while Bette was the Star of the Warner Bros. Lot. Ms. Field is 66 but looks ages younger but the fact is that Mary Todd Lincoln was 15 years younger than Lincoln himself. I have read that Spielberg and Day-Lewis were concerned over this fact but Field's persistence paid off and was cast. Who else could have done Mary Todd Lincoln? This film has splendid art direction and is a credit to the studios that filmed this epic: 20th Century Fox, Dreamworks and Disney. Years ago one studio would be listed as producer but in today's fragmented Hollywood co productions are the norm.PS One day I would like to see Daniel Day Lewis and Meryl Streep in a movie, what an acting duel that would be",9,2,5,14 January 2013
Some Like It Hot," Oscars for MM, Jack Lemmon, Joe E Brown, Wilder and Picture
","Some Like It Hot is arguably the funniest movie ever made. I remember when the picture was announced, and MM had been off the screen for a while. I was so happy to see MM back to work and anticipated its release. In my wildest hopes could I ever image the classic picture it became. Billy Wilder initially wanted Frank Sinatra to star with Jack Lemmon. Mitzi Gaynor was to be Sugar Kane. However when MM found out about the script her agents approached Wilder and after clearing the pix with her home studio 20th Century Fox MM became Sugar Kane in this UA pic and an immortal iconic portrayal resulted. We all know of the battles MM had with Wilder and their mutual antagonism towards each other. Such is the price of Genius. Tony Curtis replaced Sinatra and the billing was Monroe-Curtis-Lemmon. Curtis who recently died carped about MM all his life and I feel some of it is because MM took an essentially supporting role and made it the star role. While Curtis was excellent Jack Lemmon is magnificent. A special notation should be for Joe E Brown who was retired but cameback to work and gave an memorable performance.'Some Like It Hot' is very sophisticated today, 50 years ago it was stunning. Two Men in drag, and one may have as the saying goes 'jumped the fence' and lived with another man in a relationship!No praise is enough for this film and those artists who worked on it and I feel Marilyn Monroe should have won Best Actress ( MM wasn't even nominated!), Jack Lemmon should have won Best Actor and Joe E Brown Best Supporting Actor. Billy Wilder should have won for Best Director and the Picture itself should have won for Best Picture.Bravo Wilder, Monroe, Lemmon, Brown!!",10,1,1,1 December 2010
Zero Dark Thirty," Splendid Film
","Kathryn Bigelow is a brilliant director whose first work I enjoyed was Keanu Reeves film Point Break. Zero Dark Thirty is a great movie and involves the Audience at many levels. Jessica Chastain-- whom I had never seen in a film-- reminds me of a young Susan Hayward viz sexy, alluring, feminine, tough and a brilliant actress. Jessica Chastain's nomination for an Oscar is well deserved. With proper career guidance Chastain could be a leading Lady star for years.As an Army Veteran myself I am very sensitive to the way the Armed Forces are portrayed in films and I applaud Ms. Bigelow for her direction of this film and the respect shown our valiant troops.",9,2,10,14 January 2013
There Will Be Blood," The New Paul Muni
","Daniel Day Lewis escapes into a character more deeply than any actor I can recall except for the great Paul Muni, the sadly mostly forgotten and at a time the biggest star at Warner Bros during the 30's. Brilliant camera work and set decoration are apparent in this fine film but it is a Day Lewis Field Day as he mesmerizes the scenes.I wonder if the last scene is a drunken rage and that it is not real. Does he really kill the Preacher? Why did he kill the impostor who said he was his Brother? Why Murder the man? Did he murder the Man or was this all in a an alcoholic blackout?A visionary who was tough minded he lost his beloved Son at the end who also was tired of his Father's imperious moods.",8,0,0,6 July 2013
Casino Royale," Daniel Craig is Superb
","Casino Royale was a Ian Flemming film produced as a spoof in the 1960's with the elegant David Niven as Star.The new Casino Royale starring Daniel Craig is the film Ian Flemming wanted the film to be: Tough, Smashing Entertainment starring an Actor born to be James Bond, Mr. Daniel Craig.Daniel Criag is wonderful as James Bond, and no words can fully describe the elegance, toughness, and directness that Craig brings to the screen as James Bond, the best bond Ever.Judi Dench is priceless as 'M'.Highly recommend this film as enjoyable entertainment. Bravo",9,2,5,14 January 2013
Flight," Amoral Drug Adict Alcoholic Pilot
","I am sorry to write this negative review for I usually only write positive review about films and stars.Saw this film and was tempted to walk out. The film depicts a self absorbed alcoholic pilot who is a cocaine user, and what upset me greatly is that many in the audience seemed to like him as a character. Some of the performances are done well especially the young co pilot and the stewardesses on the flight crew but for one minute did I believe Denzel Washington was a Pilot. Any one consuming that much vodka on an hour flight would be flat on his back passed out.Am not an expert but when the Co Pilot saw that the Pilot ( Washington) was unfit for flying the co pilot had a responsibility to take over controls. Mr.Washington's nomination for a Best Actor to me is undeserved. John Goodman was 'comic' as the drug dealer. Why did thee Director make the Co Pilot who suffered many life enduring injuries and his wife as cartoon characters because they both found solace in Faith? The plane clips a steeple of a church as it lands in the field...is this the Director's opinion of Religion?I do not recommend this film especially with those with young families due to the blatant drug use, nudity, foul language",1,10,21,19 January 2013
Up in the Air," Clooney's Mistake
","I was so disappointed in this movie. From the get go gutter language. I travel the road, work out in Hotel gyms, drink at the Bars and never hear the profanity that was in this movie. These script writers should study the work of the great screen writers to learn that WORDS are important. Clooney looks faded, old, worn and only Garbo could have that blank look and get away with it, on George Clooney a blank look is a blank look.The women in this picture will soon be forgotten too. Where are the great lady stars of yore like Kim Novak, Julie Christie? who never had to talk trash but were mesmerizing so sexy whom you never forget!I also fly a lot and Sam Elliot looked 100 years old as a Pilot. Am sure a lot of AA pilots got rankled over how a Pilot was portrayed.I am not sure if anyone else caught this but I surmised early on that Clooney was playing a gay man trying to masquerade as a playboy straight man; deep in the closet but GayAmerican Airlines should ask for its money back.",3,1,5,1 July 2010
From Here to Eternity," Zinneman, Lancaster, Kerr, Sinatra, Reed, Clift Classic Film
","In beautiful black and white photography famed Director Fred Zinneman displays a great ability to capture military life. As an Army Veteran myself, I saw a lot of realism in this film. Burt Lancaster was a perfect Hollywood Leading Man and Great Box Office Star with hits such as Birdman of Alcatraz, Judgment at Nuremburg, Elmer Gantry and this great Columbia classic. Deborah Kerr was perfect in the female role once assigned to Joan Crawford. Joan Crawford was a much better actress than given credit for and technically one of the best actresses ever, but wasn't her persona that her characters slept around? Rita Hayworth would have also been a great selection and as Queen of Columbia surely was considered. Ms. Kerr had a ladylike image and this role was casting against type. The beach scene is erotic and yet understated. If the film were made today that scene would be so blunt Splendid work by Donna Reed, Frank Sinatra, Ernest Borgnine and Montgomery Clift. Kudos to All and to Harry Cohn of Columbia who was also referred to as uncouth but what films Columbia made under Cohn's tenure: Mr. Smith Goes To Washington, Lost Horizon, Love Affair, Mr. Deeds Goes To Town, The More the Merrier, All The King's Men, Born Yesterday, Picnic, and this film among many many others, and just before Cohn died a Columbia Pictures masterpiece, The Bridge On The River Kwai, maybe we need more 'uncouth Executives' like Harry Cohn!!",10,2,3,29 May 2011
