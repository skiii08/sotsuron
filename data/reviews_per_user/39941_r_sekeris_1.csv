The New World," This. Is. Too. Slow. For. Me.
","I do consider myself a cinema lover: I've made my own home theater (my living room looks like an old cinema) and find myself twice a week searching for new DVD's to add to my extensive collection. I don't mind slow movies either: I just love Lost in Translation for example. I guess there is a difference between a slow movie and a tediously slow movie, like 2001: A space Odyssey and of course this one. I've sat trough 1.5 hours of 'A new world' but that was as far as I could go. You could actually die of boredom watching this flick. They really should place a warning on the back of the DVD box. If you want to see a good movie about the native Americans go see Dances with Wolves.",3,1,5,19 March 2007
