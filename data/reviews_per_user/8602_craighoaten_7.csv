Hereditary," Rubbish
",This film is rubbish. The End... a few creepy bits but other than that it's terrible.,4,1,3,22 June 2018
Us," A Total waste of life
",This isn't the worst film I have ever seen but it's in the mix. Typical best bits in the trailer movie. Make's absolutely no sense. So disappointed as I looked forward to this. I'm not sure if it's a comedy or a horror but was terrible at being both. Honestly watch something else.,2,0,0,7 June 2019
Midsommar," What??? Just what??
",I have watched some disturbing films in my time but this was a belter for disturbing and not even in a good way. It was like the director came up with a really messed up idea and his colleague's decided to just add to it with more messed up ideas. I watched it to the end to see where it went and it just went from bad to worse and beyond. Do yourself a favour and avoid this film. It's a waste of time and will leave you sat puzzled and disturbed.,1,19,31,26 September 2019
It Chapter Two," Rubbish!!!
",Don't waste your time it's awful and goes on for ages. A couple of jumps but awful for the next 2 hours and 55 minutes. Avoid,1,23,38,6 September 2019
It Chapter Two," Rubbish!!!
",Honestly this is a terrible film. Such a poor remake of a horror classic. Cheap unfunny joke's a few jumpy scenes but I think that was due to the share volume in the cinema. Do not waste your time on this you will regret IT!!!,1,14,28,6 September 2019
12 Strong," Weak!!
","I did not expect much from this film and it delivered just that. Bad acting, cheesy moments and plenty of unnecessary explosions which was probably where most of the money was spent. It's predictable and unrealistic. Not worth watching.
4* at best",4,53,130,5 April 2018
Creed II," Worth a watch.
","The Rocky Films are Legendary. Every Kid that watched the early Rocky films wanted to be a boxer truly inspirational cinema at its best. That being said from Rocky IV they Started to go way down hill. That bring's me on to Creed, practically a replica of the later Rocky just more street, cheesy and obvious. You have practically seen the film before watching. It's ok at best.",5,0,2,12 June 2019
