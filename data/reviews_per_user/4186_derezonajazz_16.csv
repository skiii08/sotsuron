Blade Runner 2049," Doesn't beat the original
","Great cinematography and cast. There's nothing more that they could do with the script that was given. I feel direction is what failed this film from being perfect. The pacing is slow and story a bit all over the place in my opinion. Sigh...and I loved the original - ah well. A decent film, but not a great film!",7,8,14,29 September 2018
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Prefer the first
",The action sequences and even gore animations weren't as compelling in this film. The first was better.,7,0,1,15 March 2019
Se7en," Wow
",Such a well written and disturbing psychological crime thriller that will leave a bitter taste in your mouth all the way through.,10,0,0,15 March 2019
Fight Club," Beautiful
",Can't get enough of this film. A psychological thriller that will have you glued to the screen. Fine performances and a nice soundtrack.,9,0,1,14 March 2019
Inglourious Basterds," comedic war film with a message
",A film which gives power to the victims through comedy during WW2. I'm glad we can laugh and overcome our dark past through such movies,8,4,7,15 March 2019
The Fifth Element," Fun ride
",Sure there's some cheesy moments amidst a serious plotline- but this film does it so well combining the 'elements' so to speak!,9,1,2,15 March 2019
Forrest Gump," Iconic
",Hanks is a fine actor and brings Forrest to live in this gorgeous film with some very memorable moments- particularly his heartwarming relationship with Lt Dan and Bubba. Well worth the watch,9,0,1,15 March 2019
28 Weeks Later," Mixed feelings
",I found the British one more raw and disturbing than this. I guess sequels often can't beat the originals. This film definitely has its moments. The violence and stories of the individuals are very disturbing and leave a sick taste in your mouth. Definitely still enjoyable when you're in the mood for a horror film.,7,10,16,28 September 2018
The Machinist," Really good Christian Bale movie
","Old as it is, one of his best - forget Dark Knight where he had no personality- this film will introduce you to a very different side of Bale. What's more commendable is the sheer weight loss he endured for the role - what commitment! Very raw, very dark and definitely worth the watch.",9,6,9,28 September 2018
The Love Guru," Mess
",This film takes the medal for the worst comedy of all time. Poor taste even in today's time,2,0,1,15 March 2019
The Dark Knight," Great but long
",This film follows a tale of antiheroes And villains - well portrayed by the likes of ledger and eckhart. Bale is mediocre as always in this franchise. It was a bit long but an enjoyable watch,8,0,0,14 March 2019

",This is a touching film with brilliant performances by Hanks and Duncan - check it out!,8,0,0,15 March 2019
The Silence of the Lambs," Disturbing
",A very disturbing film and taboo area for the time. I loved Hopkins in this. I felt some of the violence was a bit gratuitous but didn't detract from it being a well acted and well written film,8,0,0,15 March 2019
Sin City," Comic style drama
",It was a great stylized action adventure film without a lot of substance in the writing. Character development was lacking. Otherwise an enjoyable watch,7,0,0,15 March 2019
Donnie Darko," Bleak and disturbing
