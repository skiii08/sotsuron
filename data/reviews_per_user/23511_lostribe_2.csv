Frost_Nixon," Lighter hearted than you'd expect
","I just wanted to say that I had trouble getting anyone to go to this movie with me because everyone expected it to be dry and depressing. This had mainly to do with the fact that people from my generation remember this era all too well, and it was quite painful at times. In fact, largely because the movie focuses on David Frost as much as Nixon, there are many humorous moments in the movie. I really expected to see a lot of time devoted to rehashing the events of that era, and was surprised that you saw none of the usual anti-war demonstrations you would expect, hippies being perhaps the only group of people besides politicians who weren't exactly shocked when Watergate exposed a high level of corruption, since they had so often been the target of it. I can't explain why that was left out entirely, though it was referred to obliquely, being the group Nixon most reviled.Nevertheless, it was fun taking a peek into Frost's world, and his character truly sparkled. Very entertaining movie with a great cast.",8,1,4,2 February 2009
Crash," Contrived
","I was extremely disappointed with Crash. There were a lot of characters developed in the movie, and all of them said and did things that were more extremely rude or exaggerated than anything I have encountered in real life. In fact, almost every character was just a big jerk, and I didn't care what happened to them. There was one that was someone who seemed consistently nice and that you could empathize with. I can't believe Hollywoodites jumped all over this movie for an Oscar. It was entirely composed of contrived nonrealistic scenarios designed only to please uninformed idealists. And that's not me saying idealists are a bad thing, but I prefer smart ones who can face reality and deal with it while setting their sights higher. I don't see the point of making excuses for and glorifying in media a bunch of jerks in order to try to make them sympathetic when there are so many good people who may have also suffered bad circumstances but still chose to be a nice person instead of a jerk with an excuse. Let's glorify those people instead. And I believe there's many more of them than there is the other.",4,5,12,24 August 2006
