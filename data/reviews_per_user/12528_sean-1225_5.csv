Alien 3," Alien 3 tried to be more like the first film, but it failed for a few reasons...
","David Fincher is known for making many famous films such as Seven and Fight Club, but this was his first feature length film. Alien 3 tried to be more like the first film in the series but it didn't have that feeling about one Alien on a spaceship hunting seven people down. Instead, Ripely is left on a prison planet where there are loads more people and the Alien is stronger. I didn't like the film for a few reasons, and one was because too many people died too early into the film, which I found annoying. Also you are desperately waiting for Ripely to tell everyone about the Alien on the planet, so that the film can properly, but instead there is just more talking which gets boring. We also see the Alien too easily because you see it up front, but in the first and second one you could barley see it sometimes. Finally, near the end with the door part I got really confused and hated the upside-down camera shot, even though it is meant to be the Alien's eyes. My review gives the film a 5 star rating, but many people give it a 1 star, which I think is too low because there are some good things about the film. I thought the acting was pretty good in the film and some of the special effects were great, although they had made Terminator 2 a year before it so many people at the time may have thought it wasn't anything special. I loved how many ideas they could use to make the Alien kill someone, but I won't mention anything. And some people say the ending was stupid but it wasn't and I will not say anything about it. Overall I would give it a go but only if you have seen Alien and Aliens. I have never seen Alien Resurrection but I may see it soon.",5,0,0,30 May 2009
Star Trek," One of the best Science Fiction films of all time, and fans of Star Trek will enjoy it...
","I am not such a big fan of the Star Trek films and TV series, but I was lucky to see this film for y brothers birthday party with his friends and my dad. In my head I thought that this movie was going to be all boring and too much talking about stuff that makes no sense. I was totally wrong as I was glued to my seat and my eyes stared at the film for the whole thing. I must admit that I never got to see the first minute, but I managed to figure out the whole story of the Star Trek series as before it I knew nothing about Star Trek. It wasn't just the story that amazed me, it was the CGI that did. Now I really hate some films with CGI, but this film was just so good with it, and I think that if they were to use CGI more sensibly then films like this one would be great! I also loved how the planets slowly were destroyed, which looked pretty cool. This film believe it or not, was really funny too. In fact, it was not just funny, it was sad, very sad. I will not mention those parts though... For some reason this review was very hard to do, but I highly recommend it and yes, it is in my top 25 films of all time.",10,1,8,30 May 2009
Rocky V," Rocky, what have you done...
","I must say that the Rocky franchise is the best franchise of all movie series, and I love them all, except this one. I don't even count watching this one because it is so bad and dumb. The story basically is about Rocky retiring (again), and him, Adrian, Paulie and Rocky Junior have all lost there house, so they must live in Paulie's old house, in a rough area. The movie basically has nothing to do with Rocky, and mostly about his son. It is so boring, and your waiting for something to happen, but no, nothing happens. Tommy Gunn comes up to Rocky and Rocky doesn't give him an autograph (or something, I can't really remember how the met) so he gets all angry and in the end they have a fight, but not in the ring. If it is so bad then how come it did not get a 1 star? Well I must admit that I could not give a Rock movie such a low rating, as it is nice to see some of the references to the old Rocky movies in this one. All I can say is that you don't want to watch unless you are a true Rocky fan!",3,2,6,29 May 2009
Batman Returns," If you thought The Dark Knight was dark, you have not seen anything...
","Batman Returns is the sequel to the 1989 film Batman, and both of them star Michael Keaton and are both directed by Tim Burton. As I explain in the summary that The Dark Knight is very dark and violent, you have not seen a true violent Batman movie until you watch this one. The story for the movie is pretty confusing, and from what I remember, the movie takes place after Batman's encounter with The Joker, until the Penguin is terrorising Gotham city. There is also another villain who is with Penguin, and Batman's girlfriend dies and becomes Catwoman. This can get confusing to remember all the villains after watching the movie as there are three different ones, all with their own story. I don't want to spoil much of the movie, but I must tell you there are some violent parts, especially the beginning which you will know all about if you watch the film. McDonalds made some toys for the movie to release in happy meals, but it was so violent that children will want to go see it and it would cause a bad influence on them. The movie has you glued to your seat, trying not to go get a drink or go to the toilet, because some of the action scenes are the best in any super hero movie. The Penguin could only be played by Danny Devito as he does an excellent job as him. The movie could have got 9 stars but it was let down at the end where it just got way to silly for me and overall stupid. Some fans say that it is not the original story of the Penguin so they don't like it, but it doesn't even matter as the movie is so damn good! Not as good as Batman 1989 or The Dark Knight, but give it a watch and maybe you will enjoy it.",7,0,0,29 May 2009
The Terminator," One of my favourite Sci-Fi films of all time, and just as good as T2...
","First of all I would just like to point out that James Cameron is my favourite director of all time, as he has made films such as The Terminator, Aliens and of course, Terminator 2. If you have seen Terminator 2 or 3, you may not have seen the original. It is completely different to all of it sequels in a good way, and that is what I like about it. The story is basically about the war between humans and machines in 2029, and the machines send back to a Terminator to kill Sarah Conor, as she gives birth to John Conor, the leader of the human resistance. Although it seems like all hope is lost, the humans send back one of there soldiers, Kyle Reece. Only one person would be able to play Terminator, and that would be Arnold. He has the mood that the Terminator needs, and defiantly makes people laugh with all his lines throughout the films. Michael Bhien was also brilliant as Kyle Reece. It is hard too describe what genre this film can be classified as. It could be action due to how many times The Terminator, Kyle Reece and Sarah Conor meet the police. It could be horror due to all the deaths The Terminator causes, which could also be classified as slasher. The only problem I have with the film is the music, which is that 80's dance music which I hate, whereas T2 has some great music. Defiantly check this film out though as I am sure you will enjoy it, even though it is not as good as T2!",10,1,2,7 June 2009
