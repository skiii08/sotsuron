Blade Runner 2049," This one is for sci-fi fans, not for me
","Maybe it was because I haven't seen the original one, but for me this felt bit hard to get focus at the start and the build up of replicants being so different of humans didn't catch to me. Human robots but not robots and so on. Also the movie was too low tempo for me.The story itself gave me some Matrix vibes of the main character 'K' being build as the chosen one and shot down as not being the chosen one and still ending up saving everything and in a way being the chosen one. That was a hard sentence. But I really liked the story. Unfortunately there were parts that I would liked to be more centered like 'killing' of I'd Joi and K realizing it was all fake love. With the movie being as long as it is, some time could've been used for this sub-plot.Overall I unfortunately got bored watching this so I guess this kinda style just isn't for me. I liked the plot and the theme and I have liked many movies with the same theme but this just didn't work for me. That's why the low score.",5,2,4,16 March 2019
The Death of Stalin," Dark parody about the fallen Soviet Union
","A nice humoristic take on the state of the Soviet Union after WWII. The movie shows nicely the characteristics of the 'unified' party of the CCCP which in it's union is constantly plotting against each other and trying to take power whenever possible. There really aren't any good or bad guys, just men going after power and using anybody in order to get it. Characteristics work without going completely over the top. The movie doesn't give an accurate view of the history, but it isn't the movie's job. It is a parody and as such does a good job in giving entertainment. Another view would surely give new viewpoints to the movie.",9,1,1,7 March 2019
Lost in Translation," Wonderful story of a weird relationship
","An interesting story of being in the right place in the wrong time and creating an odd but yet so normal relationship. Perfect example of opposites attracting and friendships forming in a most peculiar way. Movie also shows how friendships/relationships don't form by force. Murray and Johansson play their roles well and are perfect suit of an imperfect couple. The tension between the two and Murray's character's imperfection brings more to the movie. This sort of story feel very lifelike and a one (without other person being a movie star) that could happen and in some sort of way has happened to many. And that makes the movie touching. Leaving the end open was in my opinion better than the two embracing each other and living happily ever after. Now the ending doesn't ruin the movie to half the audience, which either want the two to end up together or to stay as strange encounter in a foreign place. Maybe not a perfect movie because it kinda lack's content, but close enough for me. Also a good thing in the movie is that there isn't any forced plot twists and unnecessary sub-plots. A must see.",10,1,2,10 March 2019
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Visually powerful movie, but lacking content
","Nice blockbuster movie and a good remake/reboot of the franchise. Maybe because of this the plot was not as intriguing as I had hoping for. Also some holes in the plot and cliffhanger ending lowered the experience for me. Also because of the cliffhanger this movie didn't feel like a standalone movie, but just a preparation for the next movie(s). This feeling is intensified for me because I know the franchise and at the time of me watching this film, sequals have already come out. Visually great movie, good CGI and I liked James Franco and there could have been more of him as this is only the rise of the apes and their origin. As Franco is their creator, this could have been focused more. Now the reasoning is left to being his I'll father. Visually great, but for me, the plot is too hollow. Nice way to spend Saturday evening, but no classic",7,0,2,2 March 2019
Murder on the Orient Express," Good adaptation of the book
","It's hard to turn a well written mystery into a movie. This, I would say, does pretty good job at it. Lots of the elements are well put and modifications from the book are done well enough. Also the actors are good and pretty much many of the best have been gathered for this. Towards the end, it gets harder for the movie to keep the excitement up to par like the movie does and the ending takes a bit away from the movie by being so oddly put.Nice movie, good murder mystery with the comedy value of Hercule Poirot.",8,0,2,31 March 2019
The Shawshank Redemption," A true classic film
","Took me a long time to see this movie, but finally decided to watch it and wasn't disappointed. Probably most movie fanatics know the movie so I won't focus on the movie that much, but the feeling of watching it. This one truly feels like a classic story with the storytelling, having a clear plot, but still keeping us on your toes on what is going to happen. It depicts in a real fashion on how life can be and not being boring at any point. Story guides on one direction, but every moment feels like it could turn to a different direction. Really great storytelling, creating the feeling of hopelessness, character build and classic plot from start to finish. I truly enjoyed watching this from start to finish, nothing felt superimposed.",10,0,0,8 March 2019
Wonder Woman," Woman Tarzan meets Pocahontas
","I'm not quite sure if I liked this movie or not. It had good elements and it was nice to have the hero be portrait by a woman. Still it felt pretty much like just another superhero movie. Different setup and new characters, but still it was hero learning to be just a normal person and yet having all the burden of saving the world. Wonder woman's sidekicks bring nice addition to the movie and Wonder woman is well depicted. I just didn't get anything more from this than just a regular good superhero movie.",7,0,1,31 March 2019
The Fighter," Great acting makes you forget the film's flaws
","It is no wonder that Bale got an Oscar for his part as Dick Enlund. His adaptability and dedication to a role is unbelievable. He is easily the best part of this film. Mark Wahlberg Also fits great in to his role as the younger brother Micky. And the mother isn't bad either.Otherwise the movie is mediocre. Nice twists and turns trough most of the film, but the ending falls flat. Until then the movie is a back and forth battle of doing the right thing and falling back to old habits. Ending is just being happy ever after and all being a big happy family all of a sudden. Nice movie to watch, but nothing special.",8,0,0,28 March 2019
