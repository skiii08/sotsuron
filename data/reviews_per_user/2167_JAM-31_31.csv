Come and See," Possibly the definitive Russian front film
","'Come and See' is bizarre, disturbing, and haunting.  It is more moving and enlightening than all of the other (mostly disappointing) films I have seen depicting the Russian front in World War II.  Strangely enough, the Red Army is entirely absent from the movie.As a Russian film, it begins less conventionally than most films produced in the west.  It starts off very surreal, and it is difficult at some points to understand what is going on or what certain characters are doing.  This gives the theme a foreign and realistic feel.  We follow the life of a peasant boy in Byleorussia in 1943, as he joins the partisans.  Certain events involving his family and his introduction to the partisans (especially one involving a young girl) make his fight more personal. Strange interactions between characters and Director Elem Klimov's follow tracking shots dominate the film, and give it a unique method of storytelling.  Then the nightmare begins.The destruction of a Russian village is the horrific centerpiece of the story.  It is brutally realistic, with more tracking shots that hold for long periods of time without cutting.  We see the German Wehrmacht burn a barn loaded with civilians to the ground as these soldiers clap, smile, and embrace each other.  The chaotic action involves many scenes that are sporadic (flames burning out of control, a German soldier accidently shoved into the barn house with the victims) and possibly improvised, which lend a great authenticity to the material.  The images are unforgettable, and will stay with you long after you've seen the film.  Klimov has succeeded in putting the viewer in the village.  Surprisingly, despite coming out of the Soviet Union in 1985, 'Come and See' never felt to me like propaganda. There was no communist rhetoric, and the heroes were all partisans, many of which were flawed.  The Germans aren't caricatures at the same time they commit acts of evil, and view their actions in a banal way.  When one of them defends the atrocities of his platoon, he states, 'inferior races spread the microbes of communism.'  The character delivers this line not with fierce anger, but with nonchalance, as if it were common knowledge, not something that he needs to explain to anyone. Some reviews have criticized the 'afterthought,' a rewind of the Nazi rise to power and invasion of Europe, as unnecessary.  It may be, but it is still powerful.  Other 'flaws' people find with the movie are all characteristics of the director's style, therefore I don't find them flaws.  'Come and See' is a great, very different, and very moving film.

Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," My Thoughts on 'The Phantom Menace' (Spoilers)
","People have told me that the only reason that I liked `SWE1: TPM' is because it has the `Star Wars' name attached to it.  But I think this has an opposite effect; it gives it an enormous amount for it to live up to, since the original films are three of the greatest and most successful films ever made.It doesn't live up to any of them, but it does succeed in some places greatly, on its own.  The movie has already become one of the most discussed films of all time, so forgive me when I inevitably tread into familiar territory...THE WEAKNESSES: I didn't hate Jar Jar Binks as much as many people did, but he does bring down the movie.  His presence is quite embarrassing, especially when sharing a scene with dignified characters, such as Obi Wan and Qui Gonn Jinn.  But multiple viewings definitely reduce his annoyingness, since you will know what to expect.  You may even start to like him, maybe more so in the next episode.  Jake Lloyd is sometimes so-so, but sometimes terrible as Anakin. I feel it may be unfair to dump such criticism on a 10 year old actor, but Lucas should share the blame as well.  I really wanted to see Anakin as one messed up kid!  A moody, dark child who has the potential to go either way in his future.  Kind of like Haley Joel in 'The Sixth Sense'--why didn't they just get him to play the part of Anakin?The main flaws with this movie are in the script.  I really didn't like or buy many of the coincidences that Lucas created for this story, and this includes his reliance on characters we have already seen, both major and minor.  This is a prequel to the Star Wars trilogy, so why not work with more fresh characters?  That Anakin built C-3P0 and piloted a spacecraft navigated by R2-D2 is totally absurd.  And we don't need to see Jabba the Hut, the Tuskin Raiders, or other aliens from the previous movies to remind us that we are watching a 'Star Wars' film.  They in some cases almost undermine the vastness of the 'Star Wars' galaxy.The story can be difficult to follow at times, and it reminds us that one of the strengths of the originals was what simple stories they were.  The movie is so enormous that is actually quite overwhelming.  Countless establishing shots of new worlds is common throughout it.THE STRENGTHS: The overwhelming epic that this movie is can also be looked at as a positive.  So many worlds, and so much going on.  The worlds are all beautiful to look at and incredibly imaginative.Darth Maul is easily the best new character.  He is so silent and mysterious, yet so demonic and forceful.  He hardly speaks, and paces like a tiger when blocked by a forcefield-barrier, staring at his victim.  The final lightsaber duel is the greatest scene in the movie, and the only place where the film actually manages to top the originals.  It's fast, furious, and enthralling; Every time I see it I get chills when it begins.  The other battle sequences in the conclusion are also pretty spectacular, filled with great sound and visual effects.The storyline starts to get really good when Senator Palpatine, played by Ian McDairmid, starts to take on a significant role.  He manipulatively encourages Queen Amidala to vote against a particular senate leader (played by Terrance Stamp), whose downfall leads to Palpatine's nomination, and eventual election, to leader of the senate council.  It is quite chilling when we see him up close, after Yoda and Mace Windu claim that they know there is still an evil Sith somewhere out there, plotting against them. Apart from when he appears as a hologramed Darth Sidious, we never see any evidence of Palpatine's objectives, but since we are already aware them, he appears ever more sinister.I am still a little confused on what 'The Phantom Menace' actually was; I'd assume it was Anakin Skywalker's destiny, but could it have been more subtle?  Could it have been Qui Gon Jinn's failure to become a phantom spectre after his demise?Despite its flaws, 'SWE1:TPM' is a creative, magical, and entertaining thrill ride, and I look forward to 'Episode II'.

Raiders of the Lost Ark," The Greatest Adventure Movie of All Time
","From beginning to end, this rip-roaring action movie is perfect.  It was my favorite movie for years until it was topped by another Spielberg film, 'Saving Private Ryan' (and only because that movie's subject matter is more important)  It hits perfection on everything associated with adventure films, and nothing in its genre has come close to topping it since, save maybe its first sequel, 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.' 
It has a great plot, characters, music, exotic locales, villains, stunts, cinematography, and special effects.  Thrilling and expertly choreographed and photographed action sequences--the gunfight in the Nepalese bar and the hijacking of the Nazi plane are excellent examples.  It deserves its spot on the AFI list of the top 100 greatest movies of all time.  It was inspired by the serials of the 1930's, but represents them better than those films do themselves.  The stunt work is incredible, with hero Indiana Jones (introduced here for the first time) running from giant boulders, dragged underneath trucks, and punching and whipping his way through dozens of fights with nasty bad guys.  Harrison Ford is excellent, and so are all the supporting roles, especially Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood, and Ronald Lacey as Toht, who is possibly movie history's most menacing henchman. 'Raiders' is also scary and suspensful--many of us who grew up in the eighties remember being frightened by the beautiful spectre released by the Ark, who then morphs into a screaming death's head.  Its also quite amazing that the many snakes and spiders in this film were all real. 
Whenever you feel down, this is the movie to watch.  Pure escapism.  It is so uplifting and exciting, what more could you ask for?  Grade: A+",10,0,0,20 October 2000
Iron Man 2," Bad. Simply Bad.
","Okay, I am not a big comic book fan, nor do I know too much about 'Iron Man.' I am a big-time movie fan though, and there are certain things that a comic book movie (and basically ANY movie) needs to be successful.And they are: THRILLS... EXCITEMENT... SUSPENSE... STORY... 'Iron Man 2' has none of them. How does a movie like this get released without them? 'Iron Man 2' has no exciting plot for the hero to overcome to stop drastic consequences. No exciting action sequences to keep us on the edge of our seats. I don't know or really care how much this film keeps to the comic it was based on--if it doesn't have an involving, exciting story, it fails.All of the actors, Downey, Johannsen, Favreau, Rourke, Cheadle, give mediocre, forgettable performances. All of them are good actors who I have enjoyed watching in other films, but seem to just be trying to be cool, hip, and clever in front of the camera this time.This film should have reminded me of the 'Batman,' 'Superman,' or 'Spiderman,' films, but it has more in common with the 'Ocean's 11' movies: a bunch of big stars hamming it up, trying to be 'cool,' and having fun in front of the camera, instead of trying to make a good movie.What does Mickey Rourke's villain want in this film? How will it affect the world if he achieves his aims? Why should we care if he succeeds? Why are there no moments when Iron Man seems on the verge of losing everything? This film is an example of letting success go to the producers' and actors' heads. Hopefully the fan-boys will realize and admit it stinks before more action and comic book films turn out as dull as this one.Grade: D",3,5,9,15 May 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Bizarre, and without the 'Swashbuckling' Spirit
","I guess many may find it strange that I would be disappointed in a movie like this.  But I love a good swashbuckler, and this film would seem to be a great opportunity to make just that.  But it is not one, its just, in a word, WEIRD.  'Pirates of the Caribbean' is a very strange movie.  That doesn't have to be a bad thing, but this film just doesn't have the spirit of the old fashioned pirate films, or, despite the many references to it, the ride it was based on.What was I expecting?  I guess a film that was at least in the tradition of 'The Mask of Zorro,' or if we want to dip into the serial age, Errol Flynn's 'Captain Blood' or 'Robin Hood.'  People might claim that the cliches of these films are old and uninteresting, and that the other attempts to imitate them did not go over well (many will site 'Cutthroat Island.')  But I don't think it would have been that hard for the producers of this film to come up with something that had a traditional, fun, engaging, and original storyline.  'Zorro,' 'The Three Musketeers,' and Kevin Costner's 'Robin Hood' arguably held their audiences and entertained them, without the absence of this rousing spirit.  Some might even claim that 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy has swashbuckler-pirate film influences.'Pirates of the Caribbean' has a bizarre plot and even stranger characters. I still can't really explain what this film was about--not what one would expect from a straight-pirate movie.  The plot involves pirates who are 'undead.'  I have no problem with that--in fact, the movie would have been great if it had been influenced by 'Army of Darkness.'  The undead skeletons of this movie wearily drag their feet along, argue with each other, and act miserable.  Other than a few monologues on how it really sucks to be dead, I never really got the feeling that these pirates were really that bad-off. After all, they can't be 'killed' this way (which somewhat makes the sword-fights irrelevant.)  An even bigger mystery to me was why these pirates needed to be STOPPED from lifting their curse.  I'm sure it was right there in the script (I believe it had something to do with the safety of those whose blood was needed to lift it) but this never really added any urgency to the plot.The bottom line seems to be that nobody is ever having much fun on the screen; even Johnny Depp, for all of his eccentricities, never seems to be enjoying himself.  Orlando Bloom expressed delight in counting his number of kills and in sliding down the smooth stones of a castle, shooting arrows in 'The Two Towers,' yet he never does anything like that here.  On a level that is rather un-PC, I'm sure that in many ways it would have been a blast to have been a pirate!  Nobody seems to believe that in this movie.  The pirates on the ride sure did--they drank, they sang, they raped and pillaged, and burned villages to the ground.  The pirates in this movie just lumber, whine and argue with each other.  They do some plundering but never seem too thrilled about it.  Where's all the drunken debauchery?   This movie needed more of that.  It also needed the partying band of skeletons from 'Army of Darkness,' a campy and fearful villain (Jeffrey Rush could have still played the part), and a hero in the tradition of the films I have mentioned above.  There are some positives.  The props and ships are impressive, the special effects and cinematography are quite good, and there was much thought put into the elaborate (although strangely isolated) set pieces.  I guess I am glad that this movie is doing well, in that it may bring back the genre. But 'Pirates of the Caribbean' probably doesn't deserve to be the movie to do that.

Terminator Salvation," Why this film didn't work
","'Terminator 2: Judgment Day' is one of my all time favorite films. The way that movie ended, so beautifully wrapping things up, I was against any more sequels being made. I am glad that that film still stands on its own, self contained, and that James Cameron had nothing to do with this film or the last one.I was still excited about 'Terminator Salvation,' though. The mythical future war against the machines I thought would be a great setting for a movie. But it turned out to be an opportunity wasted.The main problem with this film is John Connor. Casting Christian Bale in this role was a great start, but unfortunately a finish. After reading an article about how director 'McG' (No, it's not too late for him to change that name) pleaded with a resisting Bale to take the role, 'Give me a chance!' I was willing to give him one too. But then I read that John Connor wasn't even originally in the script. That he was added later. This makes the role almost unnecessary, and it shows. Why was the script written without him in the first place? If you are going to do a 'Terminator' movie without Arnold, then you HAVE to have John Connor in it.John Connor in this film is flatly written and boring. It diminishes his importance and damages the mythology of the franchise. His brief entrance and appearance in T2 presented him like a legend as did Kyle Reese's description of him in the first Terminator film. Instead, Connor is never interesting or charismatic, and his only 'motivational' moments come with passionless speeches over the radio. He needs to be William Wallace, Spartacus, George Washington, and all great leaders rolled into one.The other major problem with the film is its convoluted story and lack of originality. I found Sam Worthington's character and performance mediocre in this film. His terminator-like character is a ruthless, evil bad guy, then a bad guy with heart, who is a machine, but he doesn't know it character arc is not so clear, and at the same time a cliché. One of the worst moments of cliché in this film comes when the 'Blair Williams' character learns that Worthington is a terminator machine, yet still decides to rescue him from Connor and the resistance. OK, so Worthington saved her in a previous scene, but now she knows he's a terminator! Hello? Don't you think she should listen to the resistance when they prove to her that he's a machine and a dangerous enemy? Even if you can argue that her actions were plausible, do we really need to see this tired, dumb-character cliché in another movie? As for the rest of the film, action scenes are ranked somewhat exciting to routine. Special effects are decent, although the world these characters live in isn't that impressive, exciting, or believable. Grade: D+",3,7,12,12 June 2010
A Bridge Too Far," Impressive Late 70's All-Star-Cast Epic
","Whether or not this is your type of film, you have to admit that the spectacle is very impressive.The airdrop sequence (photographed long before CGI) is an awesome sight.  So are the battle scenes.  The movie is told in the style of the day, of an all-star-cast war epic.  The battle scenes are huge, bloody, and explosive, but they don't cause fear and put you right at the center of the battle the way that, for example, 'Saving Private Ryan' did.I liked all the performances, and most of the casting choices were dead on (Connery and Hopkins, for example, but excluding Max Schell, who did well with the part, but I believe the real Bittrich was bald.)  I also really liked the performances of Michael Caine, Elliot Gould, and Ryan O'Neal.The score of the film is great.  Typical historic license is taken for some parts of the movie (The British, not the US under Major Cook, captured that bridge), but as a whole it seriously lets you understand the tragedy of Operation Market-Garden.  I recommend this highly to any fan of the genre.",Null,0,1,18 April 2000
Lost in Translation," Couldn't really empathize
","On the one hand, this film will inspire many conversations, about the film itself, about the future of the characters, and about the meanings and relevance of the situations that the characters experience (assuming you take enough interest in the film not to just blow it off).  But I can't LOVE this film the way so many people seem to.  I just couldn't get into it, despite its strengths.Why I couldn't is that I just feel little sympathy for Bob Harris, played by Bill Murray, no matter how good the performance was.  He is presented as somewhat of a 'has-been' actor.  He is miserable in Japan, as he gets 2 million dollars for a couple of whiskey spots--I'll let the absurdity of that thought speak for itself.  I understand that he feels he is selling out, and he would rather be doing a play.  Well Bob, you just made 2 million dollars--go home and do a play now!  A friend who loved the film said that doing those commercials in Japan is 'demeaning.'  Why?  Its a regular part of the acting profession.  They make their money doing things like this, then they can afford to do the projects they want.  This might sound cliche, but I just have trouble feeling bad for a man who has been successful in a field that has such a low success rate; millions of people have tried and failed to break in, and would kill to be in his position.  Then there are the experiences in Japan, in particular, the ones on the set, that drive him bonkers.  I don't know why.  One segment has a director speak in long speeches in Japanese, then his translator gives instructions to Bob with only one word commands.  Ok, so that's a little weird and annoying.  Then there's the next director, who is nicer, but asks Bob to do things to advertise the drink that don't really make sense, mostly because we sense translation difficulties.  So again, that's weird, and yes, this culture is different from our own--what's the big deal here?  Bob is asked if he drinks the whiskey, and he replies that he will 'as soon as I'm done.'  As with most of his commercial-set experiences, I just can't share in his cynicism.Where Sophia Coppolla's cynicism is more successful is in her depiction of actors and directors.  Apparently, everyone in this film is based off of someone she knew, with Scareltt Johansson playing 'Charlotte,' based on Sophia, herself.  Sophia met actress Cameron Diaz on the set of her husband's (Spike Jones) film, 'Being John Malkovich.'  This is where the film gets 'ballsy.'  I know of many films in which real people, including actors are represented by fictional characters.    The representation of Cameron Diaz in this film, by Anna Farris takes this concept one step further; it is a flat-out vicious ATTACK.  Farris plays 'Kelly,' who is possibly the most clueless, annoying, and outrageously stupid character I've ever seen in a serious film.  Since the word is out, Anna has said that she admires Diaz, and comparisons between Diaz and her character are not true. This is mostly damage control I suspect, but I guess it would be necessary here, if to prevent a feud.  In recent times, I can't think of anything more specific and nasty!Then there is the relationship between Bob and Charlotte (which actually takes too long to get going).  I don't feel what others do for several reasons.  I noticed Scarlett Johansson first in 'Ghost World.'  I don't know why it took so long for her to become the new 'it-girl.'  She is extremely interesting and charismatic (and as she matures is becoming quite sexy). People I have talked to have described the two characters in this film as soul-mates, and have talked about how special their time together was.  I have traveled and have actually had similar experiences, and in this case, I empathize with Bob.  But I can't see that in Charlotte.  Bob will, of course, think of this experience forever.  He will always look at it as a bright spot in his depressed existence, and yearn for the day he comes back into contact with Charlotte.  Charlotte will probably move on in a few days. Not that this experience couldn't mean as much to a young woman as it does to a man (as it was well presented in, 'Before Sunrise'), but I did not get that feeling from her.  She will go back to her life, maybe change things, but she will probably meet plenty of others with whom she will share this connection, others who will probably mean much more to her.  She was flattered by Bob, and enjoyed his company, but her interest appears misleading in my eyes (maybe this film is more proof that MEN are the real romantics!)One final thing: I'm getting really tired of seeing marriage depicted in a cynical way by Hollywood.  In this film, Bob's wife no longer pays attention to his 'needs' as he talks to her on the phone.  She is more concerned with material things, like the items and utilities of their house, and doesn't listen to him.  He tries to connect with her and she rudely rejects him--she doesn't 'get' him, we know!  They are in a tired relationship--I've seen this a thousand times in modern movies.  The best thing I can say about 'Lost in Translation' is the discussion that it might provoke after viewing it.  Grade: B-",Null,0,0,29 December 2003
The Aviator," Major Disappointment
","I was looking forward to this movie probably more than any other this year. After all, I love aviation, aviation history, the 1930's, the 1940's, and am a fan of biopics. Based on the early reviews for it, I was not going to be disappointed. But regardless of the acclaim that this film gets or the awards that it may receive, 'The Aviator' is pretty much a mess.To be fair, although I have always found him interesting, I am not very knowledgeable on Howard Hughes' life. I knew that he had contributed much to aviation, that he was very rich and successful, about the 'Spruce Goose' fiasco, about his reclusive end, and I had loved 'Hell's Angels.' It's tough not to admire a pilot pioneer whose main passions appeared to have been flying, making films, and hot women. But all of these elements failed to live up to those things on screen.'Hell's Angels' is one of the most interesting and unusual films that can be seen today. It wasn't a dramatic masterpiece; it was more of a guilty pleasure. Today we marvel at the incredible stunt work and visuals from that film, as well as a zeppelin attack that resembles campy science fiction, a silly love triangle with over-the-top acting, and images that have been colored by hand, long before movies were in color. The stories behind the making of that film are equally interesting; it is rumored that three pilots died while making it, and that Hughes himself performed a stunt that nobody else would. These things are only mentioned as an afterthought at the movie's premiere.Then there is Hughes' 'womanizing.' Leonardo Dicaprio is too boyish, and just not believable when it comes to this. Since we know that Hughes had every major starlet at some point, we are just supposed to accept that Hughes had the charm and wit to get them. But what is his charm, other than that he's a hot-shot pilot with lots of money (ahem... did I just answer my own question?) A scene where HH seduces a cigarette girl (added at Leo DiCaprio's request) is poorly written and flat-out unconvincing--he's doing a poor man's imitation of Trent seducing the cocktail waitress in 'Swingers,' at best. Leo never has much chemistry with the women who come and go throughout his life. Why did they stay (if, only briefly) with him? A scene with Catherine Hepburn's family makes us believe that she was his most important connection, yet the scene really doesn't fit in with the rest of the story--it is a plant with no payoff.Many other scenes are just there, yet provide no drive or momentum for the film; why do we need to see Jude Law play Errol Flynn (also unconvincingly) in one scene? What was the point of the (suppossedly hilarious) scene in which Ian Holm tries to convince the ratings board with calipers that the cleavage presented in 'The Outlaw' is acceptable? What I was most disappointed with in 'The Aviator' were HH's achievements in aviation. We all know that he was an important pioneer in aviation, but after seeing this film, I can't exactly say why. The dream of expanding the airlines is mostly dealt with by depicting the rivalries of Pan-Am and TWA--not very interesting. Most of his daring exploits are, again, poor imitations, this time of the daring exploits from 'The Right Stuff'--a far superior film. Great emphasis is placed on the 'Spruce Goose,' which is probably not something that HH should be too proud of. The film really loses steam in its last third; by the time he made it to the hearings, I really didn't care whether HH won or lost.Howard Hughes was a lot of things, but I can't tell what was most important about him after watching 'The Aviator.'

The Village," Lame and Uninspiring
","(Spoilers, of course)I haven't 'given-up' on Shyamalan yet.  I really liked 'The Sixth Sense,' and 'Unbreakable' was a decent film too, if not as good as TSS.  'Signs' had some great scenes and moments of suspense, even if it had gaping plot holes (aliens killed by WATER???  The essential building block of all life in the universe???)But 'The Village' has almost nothing to offer. Besides a few eerie scenes, it can't be considered a 'horror film' for very long.  And it has a 'big twist' that, unlike '6th Sense' or 'Unbreakable,' this time I saw coming.We are introduced to a bizzarely timeless village.  It resembles a village in Colonial America in the 1600's, but then we see a tombstone that states it is the 1890's.  So what is the purpose then, of this outpost?  Why do they act more like colonial pilgrims than people from the turn of the century?  Nobody we meet has much of a defined role, and we know little about how these people live.  Nobody makes a very strong impression (although Adrien Brody really tries to, disappointingly bad after his outstanding performance in 'The Pianist')We learn early on about 'those we do not speak of,' monsters whom the village is at war with, and get a brief glimpse of the creatures shortly afterward.  At about the half-way point we learn that we have been cheated out of the horror-film that we were expecting, and find that those monster-creatures are an illusion to keep the occupants of the village within its boundaries.  I understand that Shyamalan wants to shock us, but couldn't he at least do it by sticking to the same genre?  At that moment, I thought the 'big twist' was abundantly clear; the adults speak of the 'outside world' and talk about how important it is that their children not learn of it.  I also caught that the adults seem to drop their way of speaking at this point, too.  They have also mentioned the evils of money and wealth.As young Ron Howard's daughter makes her way to the outside world, I kept waiting for her to come across a Pepsi-can, or some other hint that would give us the twist.  When it does come, surprise-surprise, with a jeep and a park ranger, some of the theatre was surprised. I expected it to come this way, so obviously I wasn't shocked.When a writer is in his earliest stages of brainstorming, he often comes up with a concept that he likes.  After thinking more and more about it, he may come across plot-holes or other elements that convince him that the story is not worth writing, and that he should dump the idea and move on to other things.  Shyamalan should have dumped this idea in this stage, because it doesn't work--it's stupid!  When learning of these people's history, we are supposed to believe that this is their backstory for forming some timeless cult in the woods of Pennsylvania?  This idea is dumb and unbelieveable. Why couldn't they just join up with the Amish?  Each adult in the village has an explanation of why they are there, and none of them are genuine--they are all just weak excuses to pull a lame twist on the audience that we would never find believeable in the first place.Grade: D-",Null,0,1,14 August 2004
Cold Mountain," A Flawed but Interesting Civil-War Epic
","(Moderate Spoilers)I enjoyed this film, and am surprised at the amount of criticism andanger lavished upon it.  True, it is flawed, and for most of thereasons that people have cited; Nicole Kidman looks out ofplace--tall and beautiful, with great skin and teeth;.  There is anabsence of black characters, when at this time, 1/3 of thepopulation of North Carolina was black; The film was made inRomania, when it took place in the states.  I personally don't mind it that the characters are all too 'pretty' to bein this film.  The way people look has much to do with the reasonthey become stars.  The absence of black characters may be amore valid criticism, as there were many in the book.  But thisdoes not take away from the story.  And, although I feel for thepeople who protested this movie because it meant losingentertainment jobs for Americans, Romania served as a greatlocation to film this movie, as it had many spots untouched byindustry, could convincingly depict the four seasons of the year inthe short period that they had to film, and of course, it brought thebudget down.'Cold Mountain' is a brutal and disturbing odyssey, much more sothan Anthony Minghella's other epic, 'The English Patient.'  In it, wewitness graphic animal slaughter, cruelty toward Southerndeserters, (including a pair of sons murdered in front of theirmother while she is being tortured), and other violent encounters. At times, it is as unpredictable as it is formulaic, as we aresurprised by characters who are suddenly killed off, or whounexpectedly come back to us.  I can't understand why people find it unbelievable that Jude Lawand Nicole Kidman would have a connection from only a fewmoments together.  War rushes things, and relationships like thishave been common (I don't know as much about the Civil War, butduring WWII, many couples divorced after the man returned home,as they hastily got married before they went overseas.)  Evenwithout war, people have devoted themselves to others whom theyhardly knew, off of brief connections they felt with each-other.  Ialso do not agree with those who complain that Law and Kidmanspend the entire movie apart, when we are paying to see themtogether.  The two leads have quite a few scenes together. 
As Law deserts and travels back to Nicole Kidman, he experiences many different encounters with interesting characters,including a woman who slaughters her loyal goat in front of us,people who routinely try to turn him over to the Confederacy, and avery powerful sequence with a war-widow (I never knew NataliePortman could act!).  These encounters are unfortunately unevenwhen compared to each other, but they all work in their own right,and always keep us interested.  Nicole Kidman's life back at homeis equally important, as is her relationship with Oscar-winner,Renee Zellweger (and I do pity that poor rooster!)  A posse of menstays in the town to hunt and kill deserters, providing manysuspenseful and frightening moments; these characters areoutrageously evil and murderous.  My biggest complaint about thefilm is how their story unsatisfyingly ends with a quick shootout. 
Now while I found the film to be one of the more creative,interesting, and entertaining movies of the year, I found it achievedfar less than the greatness that the filmmakers probably tried toproduce.  The script needed more work.  I haven't read the book,and I suppose it was difficult to adapt.  Something overall ismissing from 'Cold Mountain.'  It has random glimpses of greatpoignancy and emotional impact, but seems to give up tying themtogether to better define the movie.Grade: B+",Null,0,0,1 March 2004
U-571," A mediocre re-hash of 'Das Boot'
","I am not really bothered by the historical inaccuracy of this film.  I understand that today's audiences want realism, and so do I, but a thriller/adventure can take artistic license if it has to, especially if it has a good idea and an interesting twist.  But 'U-571' has neither.  It has all the typical token characters (even a smack-talking black one) in situations we have seen before.  Almost every scene in the movie is a variation of 'Das Boot,' but shorter and not half as effective.  And while 'Das Boot' was an excellent and accurate depiction of submarine warfare, 'U-571,' is just a depiction of what we've already seen in submarine movies (depth gauges going off the line, sailors looking upward, waiting for depth charges to explode, leaking sea water spraying everywhere.)  Jonathan Mostow is a very good director; he really kept us guessing and on the edge of our seats in 'Breakdown,' but he tries way too hard here, and isn't half as successful.  It's too bad that this is the project that he claims he has always wanted to do.  The only reason to see this film (and not to rent 'Das Boot') is that it is in theatres now, and has a hip cast.",Null,3,6,1 May 2000
The Patriot," More of an action film than historical fiction (Some Spoilers)
","The Emmerich-Devlin-Rodat team set out to accomplish a great deal when they began production on 'The Patriot.' The American Revolution is full of great stories and dramatic events, but surprisingly there aren't many films on this period. The film makers wanted to fill this void and also dispel many of the myths about the revolution, and present the truth that, as Dean Devlin said, 'the revolution started in the north, was fought in the south, and was won by the French.' 'The Patriot' isn't a horrible movie, but it fails on many levels. First, the issue of slavery: Well, while his sister-in-law has slaves, Benjamin Martin (Mel Gibson) has black 'workers' who work for him out of their own free-will. This is a difficult issue to deal with. Francis Marion, the character whom Benjamin is based on, did have slaves, and he was guilty of many other horrible things. Depicting Martin with these workers is basically a white-wash of the period--so much that it's offensive. Although at the time freedom, separation of church and state, and free speech were considered revolutionary ideas, audiences could not root for a slave-owner. Perhaps it would have worked better if Martin had neither slaves nor these `workers' employed for him.  As presented in the film, it doesn't appear genuine--it's a cop-out.Second, the raw brutality of the film is so manipulative that it's almost flat out ridiculous. Nobody, we learn early on, is safe from being killed off, just to get a rise out of us. 'The Patriot' premiered at a time when unflinching realism was politically correct and popular with audiences. In some ways it seems as if Emmerich, Devlin, and Rodat wanted to cash in on this phenomenon, if not to at least add their own entry to the genre of shocking, harsh war films. Jason Isaacs as Col. Tavington gives a completely monstrous performance, having no sympathy for anyone, in one scene stuffing all the inhabitants of a village into a church and burning it to the ground. Many atrocities were committed during the American Revolution, but this scene is not an accurate representation of events that occurred at this time (Dean Devlin admits on the commentary track that the scene was complete artistic license.) But the scene wasn't even necessary--in fact, all Tavington needed to do to appear a 'monster' was shoot prisoners of war (in which case, 'Tarleton,' the character he is based on, did.) Another embarrassing scene that (thankfully) didn't make it to the final cut had Tarleton torturing one of his defiant victims, brazenly claiming to him that he `always' does his worst.  American audiences do not need to be convinced that the Revolution was necessary. In fact, 'The Patriot' would have been much more successful if it had been ambiguous--tough, uncouth, and unsaintly militia taking on a more humane British enemy would have been more intriguing. Many of the militia members are rough and unmerciful, but the general black and white theme is present at all times. Other problems include various inaccuracies, like those amazingly accurate pistols from the 18th century, that always seem to find their targets.  A monologue from Mel Gibson about one of his past atrocities is so clichéd it fails to have any impact.  A character plays dead, faking out his opponent, dating back to action films of the 80's (or before.)  And let's not forget that unforgivable line, `It's a free country or at least it will be.'These strong weaknesses definitely demote the film, especially considering that it was created to earn prestige and acclaim.  But `The Patriot' does succeed on some levels, and it is worth seeing.  Mel Gibson claims that he strongly identified with his Benjamin Martin, being that he is also a father of seven children.  This strengthens his credible performance.  The period sets, costumes, and a great assemblage of character actors create awesome spectacle, and the film is photographed very well.  Many of the film's most obvious exploits do work: A moment between Benjamin Martin and one of his daughters is truly touching, and Heath Ledger's apology to his father about one of his past mistakes is a very moving scene.  The sound and visual effects are very good, and so are many of the battle scenes.  The theme that militia tactics were a large factor in the defeat of the by-the-book British is what works best.  I enjoyed 'The Patriot,' I just wish they did better.  Grade: B-/C+",Null,1,3,13 February 2002
Cross of Iron," Hell on the Eastern Front
","I just gave this film a second viewing, and realized that it is far superior in many ways to other films depicting the eastern front, primarily 'Enemy at the Gates' and 'Stalingrad.'  I originally didn't think there was much separating it from Peckinpah's other films; it has a heavy influence on manly bonding, slow-motion shots of soldiers twitching as blood-squibs explode on their bodies, and what some may see as a sexist attitude towards women.  These are soldiers who are fighting a war against kids and women, fed up and disgusted by those, like Captain Stansky, who still see the Russian conquest as an heroic adventure. These soldiers aren't much different from Pike's outfit in 'The Wild Bunch.' But 'Cross of Iron' displays a very convincing atmosphere of death, horror, and futility.The film has a few low and dated production values--the 1970's haircuts, old methods of filming combat (the slow-motion, again) and some lack of scope hurt the film a small amount.  But the movie excels in depicting the terror of combat.  Being shelled by one's enemies comes off as particularly devastating.  However, scenes without combat are just as effective; A high-ranking officer realizes he can not shake hands with a combat veteran who has stubs, a truck drives right over the carcass of a rotting German soldier, and the dialogue and appearance of the men in Steiner's platoon constantly reflect weariness and fatigue.  'Cross of Iron,' together with 'Come and See,' may be the definitive war films on the Russian Front. Grade: B+",Null,0,1,6 December 2001
Pearl Harbor," A Guilty Pleasure--REALLY Guilty! (Minor spoilers)
","I had been following this production since I first heard about it for many reasons.  Mainly it was because of the spectacle and that I am a fan of war films but also because I was critical of the people behind this production.I must admit that I am not a fan of Michael Bay--I HATED 'Armageddon,' which I thought was an incoherent mess of a movie.  I was worried that Bay was not mature enough for a film like this, and that he just figured that the formula ('Titanic' + 'Saving Private Ryan' = $$$ and OSCARS) guaranteed him recognition and a box office hit.Much to my surprise, this movie was surprisingly coherent.  It also seemed to me that the quick cutting 'style' (or enormous flaw) characteristic of Bay was rather absent in this movie, or at least severely lessened.  But 'Pearl Harbor' is not inspirational or creative filmmaking; it is a standard reliance on what has worked in superior films of similar subjects.  Every camera angle, shot, line of dialogue, or stunt in this movie has appeared in a better film already.  However, this didn't ruin the movie for me.  I have a weakness for movies like this, so I found much to like.  I went along with the romance between Rafe and Evelyn, even if I forced myself to, in an idealistic fantasy way.  This is also applied to the look, feel and cinematography of the period piece; the movie looks more like it was filmed at a 1940's theme park than actually in the 1940's, but this also helped me lose myself in the romantic fantasy of the film.  The dogfights are also spectacular, and the planes probably move faster and maneauver much smoother than WWII era aircraft, thanks to the flawless CGI.  There were moments during PH where the movie would lose my attention--surprisingly enough, this happened quite a few times during the actual attack.  The footage is always impressive, but never involving enough to shock or horrify the viewer.  This was one of the consequences of Bay's directing, and not the only one (I really dislike his style of montage).I was really looking forward to the final act, which depicts the Doolittle Raid, however it was rather disappointing.  It really seemed as if the production was rapidly running out of money and had to speed through the entire sequence to get it done.  As a result, much of the suspense and interesting aspects of the bombing raid are lost on us, and they are much better presented in the classic, 'Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo.' 
Other flaws (that I had a problem with): I wish there was more of a 'it just happened' feel to Danny and Evelyn.  Instead, Danny nervously (and rather guiltlessly) follows Evelyn around and practices pick-up lines on her.  Is this an admirable (or believeable) way for him to act around the girlfriend of his presumably dead best friend?  Come to think of it, isn't Danny kind of a JERK?;  WHY are the Zeroes painted green!?  Other Japanese planes in the movie are photographed in silver, so why would the filmmakers, claiming that they are striving for accuracy, paint the legendary and infamous planes incorrectly?;  The climax (in occupied China) of the movie comes off as really convenient, yet it ads a great awkwardness to the aftermath and conclusion.I guess what is most offensive about 'Pearl Harbor' is the rush that people will get from watching a bunch of explosions and carnage, when what we are seeing is based on the deaths of over 2000 of our citizens.  Michael Bay and even Jerry Bruckheimer may have held intentions to make a respectable movie to honor the veterans (entirely secondary to the big bucks, of course), however in many ways it makes mindless summer fun out of an absolutely horrible, murderous tragedy, and that is what makes me feel guilty about enjoying this movie.

The Dirty Dozen," FANTASTIC!!!
","This film is a wonderful achievement.The story is intriguing, filled with bitter irony, violence, and tension. The characters are great, too (and so are all of the performances.)  We really get to like and care for all of the sentenced men who make the 'Dirty Dozen,' and also for Lee Marvin, the best bad-ass to ever appear on the screen!  The movie is funny, extremely brutal, and even touching at the end. Although it is quite fictional, and considered an 'action' film, it still leaves much up for discussion, such as the way these men are locked up for committing crimes at first, keeping them from doing their jobs as soldiers, or professional killers.  And once they do get their chance to serve, and become heroes, their actions are merciless--the mission is plain and simple; kill a group of unsuspecting German generals to cause confusion on the eve of D-Day.  It has many chilling moments; Lee Marvin orders that they dump gasoline on their enemies.  The MP's response, 'Gasoline!?  Are you sure?' is unforgettable, and so is Marvin's expression when he leaves the embattled chateau and sees that one of his men has been killed.The final forty-five minutes of the movie are amazingly tense--and possibly the shortest forty-five minutes you'll ever experience watching a movie. The only thing I wish they could change;  I'd like it if a certain character (the last one to get killed) lived.  Oh well, I guess it does give his arc some closure.  If you haven't seen this movie, I really recommend it. You'll wonder why it slipped by you for so long! *****",10,3,7,5 January 2000
Saving Private Ryan," Still Great, despite criticisms (some spoilers)
","This is my favorite movie of all time, and it is a great one.  Like all great movies, it has unfortunately become prone to backlash and criticism. I think that almost all of it is unfair; the movie is brilliant, and it is not supposed to be a `typical' war film.  Instead of talking about the film itself, I actually feel compelled to defend this masterpiece.First of all, what people bash more than anything are its `bookends' in the military cemetery.  Every war movie has its own theme-`Full Metal Jacket' was about men dehumanized into killers, `Gallipoli' was about soldiers as individuals, and SPR is about the sacrifices that WWII veterans made that we no longer appreciate.  The `bookends' would not have worked in `The Thin Red Line,' or `Apocalypse Now,' but they are necessary here.  True, they are a little overly sappy, and the Ryan family's girls are so attractive it is distracting.  But one of the major points of this movie is that many of us have forgotten what the veterans of this war did for us, and that we no longer appreciate the sacrifices they made.  Far too often do younger people look at those from the war generation with indifference and disrespect.  I am a WWII buff, and ever since I started reading about it in high school, I was always bothered by the fact that nobody seemed to care about it.  The faded flags that open and close the movie are not symbols of patriotism-they are our fading appreciation for WWII veterans' sacrifices.  I am happy that SPR brought a renewed interest in this subject.SPR is about the American GI's experiences in WWII Europe, and Spielberg is not claiming with this film that people of other nations did not help or die fighting fascism with us.  The Second World War almost covered the entire globe.  I would never complain about the lack of Americans in `Soldier of Orange,' or `Hope and Glory,' two great films that are about the Dutch and British experiences, respectively.SPR is not as black and white as many people claim it is.  The Germans are not all `EVIL MONSTERS' in this movie; Isn't it Americans who sadistically shoot Germans (actually Czechs) who are most obviously surrendering?  The `Steamboat Willie' Character is just a soldier doing his job--he later comes back and shoots Americans, after Miller's squad released him (and NO, he is NOT the SS Trooper that stabs Mellish with a bayonet!)  Miller made the mistake of letting `Steamboat Willie' go, because it seemed the `decent thing to do.'  But was it?  A POW who is let go cannot be expected to surrender--what do we expect him to do?  Tell his army upon meeting them that he can no longer shoot at Americans? According to the Video Hound book on war movies, the SS Trooper who stabs Mellish tells him, in German, `Don't fight it.  Soon this will be over.  You're going to a better place.'  He is mercifully killing his enemy. He also lets Col. Upham live, since Upham poses no threat to him.  This soldier is a good soldier, unfortunately on the opposite side.  To many, it may seem like the Germans are depicted as monsters in this movie.  But we must look deeper, and remember that men under fire don't really care what nice guys their enemies are outside of war.  And comments like, `The German army were not Nazis.  They were just soldiers' are as much generalizations as saying `all Germans were Nazis.'  There were plenty of Nazis in the Wehrmacht.  As far as I know, SPR was well received in Germany.  Spielberg was honored with an award there shortly afterward.This movie is anything but unrealistic.  I think I even saw a claim on the IMDB that it was fake because `Soldiers would never storm Normandy without air and artillery support.'  Guess what?  They did!  Normandy was an awful mess!  Heavy cloud cover and fear of killing their own soldiers prevented the US from defeating the defenses at Omaha, and lead to the ultra-realistic slaughter depicted in the first half-hour of the movie.Some have called the actions of the Germans in the final sequence (one of the greatest I have ever seen), `unrealistic,' and `unintelligent.'  At this point in the war, the German army was in no position to carry out proper by-the-book battle tactics.  They were under Hitler's stubborn orders to `hold at all costs' and were sent on many suicidal missions like this one.  It was so bad that by the time of the Battle of the Bulge, Americans were appalled at the way that German soldiers marched right up a road, in broad daylight to the front.  Historian Steven Ambrose said that Americans had no choice but to open fire on the columns, and mow them down 'like a scythe cutting wheat!' Besides, Generals, Captains, Lieutenants, and Privates, etc. on both sides make horrible mistakes, and this war was no exception. As for the plot of this movie, one historian described it as `Very possible, but not very probable.'  Take the case of Fritz Niland of the 501st PIR.  All three of his brothers were killed in combat, in different divisions.  Luckily, high officials in the US army knew where he was, and they had him sent home, immediately.I don't see how anyone could not be affected by the opening sequence on Omaha Beach.  It is clearly amazing.  Actual veterans have offered their medals and patches to Spielberg because of it.  The climactic battle sequence is absolutely unforgettable.  I've seen it so many times, yet it is still difficult to watch.  It is incredibly suspenseful, frustrating, explosive, horrifying, and shocking, yet it is all beautifully and coherently filmed.  When Miller tells Ryan to `earn this,' he is also speaking to us, to the generations born after WWII, who have to respect what the veterans have done.Most of us haven't `been there,' and we will never be able to say that we know what combat is like.  But Spielberg has pleased veterans in creating a movie that depicts their experiences as well as a movie possibly can.  SPR is a wonderful movie that will always be remembered, and that's worth more than any Oscar award it could have received.",10,0,1,15 May 2000
The Pianist," Awesome... You will bear witness!
","'The Pianist' is one of the most realistic and convincing films about the holocaust and about Poland in the war years.  What makes it so grand is that it is told with honesty and without emotion, or dramatization.  We see the events as they happen, without any added emphasis or, without what some would call 'manipulation.'Watching 'The Pianist' is like bearing witness to life in the Warsaw Ghetto. We see what Szpileman saw, and we never extend beyond his point of view. As a result, things are left unexplained; characters that help him or know him disappear, and we do not learn of their fates (like the blond female resistance fighter).  Other events do not always have an explanation, but we see them anyway; the SS man who suddenly appears and randomly forces a bunch of workers to lie face down for execution never gives us a reason for his presence.  Was it to keep the Reich's quota of dead Jews, was it 'disciplinary' or was it simple bloodlust?  In any case, this random sequence turns out to be one of the most disturbing and memorable scenes in the film.  Watching, we often get one angle, from a distance, and often without close-ups (this is a film that really should be viewed on the big screen, and I understood this when I first saw it in the theater).  We also witness horrors without any added emphasis; a family is cruely massacred, and inhabitants of the Warsaw ghetto are forced to perform humiliating tasks and do unpleasant things (like eat food off the ground) just to survive.
'The Pianist' is a visual masterpiece.  The perfect cinematography gives us a real vision of what happened in Poland.  I felt like I was watching a real column of German troops as they goose-stepped through Warsaw.  Again, Polanski does not give us a closeup: we see what Szpielman is watching and nothing more.  For history buffs and historians, there are some extremely impressive recreated images, recreations that required an effort that those not familiar with this period would not appreciate.  In particular, there is a shot of Jurgen Stroop, the SS man in charge of putting down the ghetto uprising, that completely matches (down to the soldier's faces) a photo taken of him and other soldiers watching ghetto buildings burn.  Another scene has ghetto residents traveling over a bridge in the ghetto; the match to the real photo is so convincing its uncanny (I showed a friend the photos while I paused the dvd and he too, was amazed.)I was also surprised at how good the film's few combat sequences were. Most of them are short and involve German/SS assault squads and resistance fighters.  They are choreographed beautifully, and are filmed in the same sort of undramatized way as the rest of the movie.  It will probably never happen, but I'd love to see Polanski direct a straight-war film.Given Polanski's past, it is hard to endorse his works with a totally clear conscience.  But one can not doubt the impact of his deeply troubled life on his very powerful works.Grade: A",Null,0,1,15 December 2003
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Steven Spielberg's Worst Film?
","Steven Spielberg is my favorite director.  I have loved almost everything he has done, so I can be quite critical of his 'disappointments.'  I think I disliked 'Hook' more than this movie, but 'Hook' wasn't pretending to be anything more than a kid's film.  I didn't have a problem with '1941,' which wasn't great, but I didn't think it was the huge bomb that many people did.The reason that 'The Lost World: Jurassic Park' could be Steven Spielberg's worst film is because it plays more like a Steven Spielberg rip-off than it does as one of his own films.  One of the things that the director is most skilled at is inferring things, giving us haunting foreshadowing that will get us lost in the fantasy of his stories.  Examples of this include: the opening scene of 'Jurassic Park,' where we cautiously await loading of a raptor to it's holding pen, that turns to horrifying disaster, without ever really 'showing' it; the opening of 'Saving Private Ryan,' where we sit with the soldiers in a higgins boat, hearing distant sounds of explosions, knowing that immense slaughter is approaching; many instances in 'JAWS,' where the IDEA of a shark is described and presented without ever SHOWING it.In 'TLW:JP,' there are countless times where we move to an extreme close-up of Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), where he realizes that something is wrong, and says something like, 'Run... as fast as you can,' while we are supposed to anticipate something.  We don't.  Nothing more than we have already seen, anyway.  When the group of hunters are trying to escape the island, there is a moment when they realize a certain danger they will face.  'Raptors,' a character says, followed by an echo of their growls; No chill down my spine. Almost every time the movie tries to instill fear and fantasy inside us it fails, as if it was directed by a novice movie maker who is trying to imitate Spielberg.The movie also has huge plot holes and many unbelievable elements; a character who tries to be good, and 'save' a T-Rex from death by replacing a hunters' bullets with tranquilizers is the main reason the animal later runs wild on the mainland.  I didn't buy the 'pack hunting' of the Compy's, and I didn't really like the scene where they kill a victim.This isn't a horrible movie, and it does have it's moments, but none of them are spectacular.  The special effects are very good, but they haven't improved much since the first movie (4 years before), and they aren't 'groundbreaking' like they were in 'JP.'  Pete Postlethwaite's 'Roland Tembo,' like 'Muldoon' in JP is one of the two movies' best and most believable characters.  He has the best story line, where he wants to hunt down a T-Rex.  However, when the moment finally comes, it turns into a disappointing, wimpy climax.  It could have been the greatest scene in the whole movie--how did Spielberg miss this opportunity?  I think he wanted to save the T-Rex's best moments for the finale on the mainland.  But the San Diego sequence, while 'different' from the rest of the two movies, isn't very good.  I read the sometimes very talented Crichton's novel before this movie came out, and it was pretty bad--just a quick way for him to make a buck.  It seems like Spielberg was unfortunately thinking the same thing this time, and directed the movie on autopilot.  Grade: C-",3,2,11,10 October 2000
Black Hawk Down," Good... But not great.
","I looked forward to `Black Hawk Down' with expectations that were almost impossible to meet.I never read the book, and I didn't know the specifics, but I remember the incident that took place in Somalia in 1993.  What I remember most about it (and will never forget) were the photographs released from the aftermath of the operation; in particular a very sickening picture of a Somali, smiling wide, looking gleefully into the camera while a dead, shirtless American GI lay dead in the background, after being dragged through the streets.  Then I heard that a movie was being made about this incident.The reviews and buzz that came out before the film's release seemed to claim that it was a modern movie classic, comparable to the ground breaking films about war and diplomatic failure of the past.  `It's at times very difficult to watch' is what I read in many different articles about `Black Hawk Down.' After seeing the trailer, which depicted a mob of blood-hungry Somali militia walking toward the camera (apparently approaching downed soldiers off-screen), I was very enthralled and nervous about seeing it.  A recreation of what I had seen in those photographs would be difficult to watch indeed. But the events depicted on screen were of course, as is almost always the case when recreating real, tragic events, not as moving as they were in those photographs.  I understand that this is an extremely difficult task. What the reviewers were referring to in respect to the `difficulty' in watching it consisted of more graphic battle gore that is becoming commonplace, resembling scenes from `Band of Brothers' and other graphic war recreations.  `Black Hawk Down' is an exciting and involving story of soldiers under fire after a mission goes wrong, and it keeps us interested in the fate of those involved.  But it really doesn't offer anything particularly new to the genre, nor does it have any profound statements about war or diplomacy that haven't already been explored.BHD is essentially a true story, but its production values keep it from feeling entirely real.  There is too much surface gloss.  It is shot mostly in the fluorescent-bluish shade that dominates all of Bruckheimer-produced films, and there is also an abundant use of slow motion.  I will be the first to defend war films that are criticized for not having enough `character development,' since stories about soldiers under fire don't necessarily need extremely different personalities to define their characters-combat will define their actions.  But BHD's characters usually only offer plot developing lines throughout the film.  Again, this is a true story, but it doesn't seem much different than fictional military thrillers, especially concerning the limited character classes-there are only three: the soldiers in combat, the enemy, and the men behind the blue blip screens trying to get things in order.  Ewan McGregor's reluctant soldier presented what felt like the most realistic personality in the film, but most of the other characters felt like they came out of a Tom Clancy novel.  The veterans of this mission deserve more.  I am one who feels that Ridley Scott's best days are behind him.  I didn't care much for `Gladiator' or `Hannibal,' both of which had too much surface gloss and not enough personal involvement with the characters.  `Alien' is still (and probably always will be) his best work, others may say `Blade Runner' is.  Where Scott does succeed in this film is in his coherence of the battle, which was quite a difficult task.  The battle scenes, although somewhat standard for a combat film these days, are intense.  They are also quite exhilarating-I found myself cheering aloud at times.  It was satisfying to see our superior troops fighting hard against enemies that have a similar value system to the ones we are fighting today.  SPOILER WARNING:  Most of the soldiers survive, and our superior training and equipment inflicts tremendous casualties on our foes.  The end result is that, with all due respect to the veterans who died in this horrible conflict, I actually felt better about what happened in this incident than I did when all I knew of it was those horrifying pictures.  I don't know if that was the film makers' intention.  Grade: B.",Null,0,0,6 May 2002
The Insider," Russell Crowe gives an outstanding performance!
","I was totally amazed by Russell Crowe's performance in this movie.  It is one of the best I've seen in years.  He plays Jeffrey Weigand, a flawed protagonist, never over-the-top.  We can see and feel his pain and fear in almost every way possible, even without regarding his dialogue.I wish more people saw this film, and I can't believe that Crowe didn't get the Oscar this year over Kevin Spacey, who was also good, but just playing himself (then again, the academy also inexplicably gave best pic to Shakespeare in Love over Saving Private Ryan!)This movie is a classic underdog film, Mr. Weigand vs. big tobacco, a television corporation, and the establishment.  It is perhaps a little too long, especially in the final half hour, but it is an excellent drama, well written and well directed.  It succeeds despite its lack of violence and other conventional Hollywood blockbuster gimmicks, however, this is probably why it didn't make as much money at the box office as it deserved.

Life Is Beautiful," More than victims
","Although it isn't the most realistic look at the holocaust, 'Life is Beautiful' excellently shows us that the victims of Nazi genocide weren't just that: they were more than victims.  Other films that deal with the subject usually just depict people after the horrible events of Nazism are taking effect.  And when we read about the death camps in history books, all we see are numbers of the dead.  This film concentrates on the personalities and lives of a family who would eventually fall victim to Nazi persecution.The first half of the film is a charming love story.  It is partially a clever satire on fascism, but doesn't wallow in terror, fear, and thuggery. Instead it concentrates on Guido's (Roberto Benigni) romantic pursuit of Dora.  We wish the best for them, but learn that this is not possible with the start of the second half.What we see of the holocaust from that point on isn't the most graphic or brutal depiction of what happened, and that is why this movie has been criticized.  It does however, make you fear for Guido and his family, and we empathize with him throughout his ordeal.  A scene where he thanks the SS man who shoves him onto a train in front of his son disturbingly captures the humiliation that a situation like this would result in.That Guido is making it seem like it is all a game to his son makes a great, haunting story, one that his son will think of forever.

Stalingrad," Street fighting scenes are best
","I was very excited when I first saw this movie on the shelf at the video store.  I am a history buff, and I love WWII films.  At last, I thought, they made a movie about the eastern front. How was it?  Fair.  It unfortunately has many shortcomings. The best scenes involve the mid stages of the battle, in the bombed out ruins of the city--although they don't explain to us that it was the Germans who bombed the city to ruins, making lots of places for Soviet soldiers and guerillas to hide.  The scenes of woundings and amputations in the improvised sewer hospital are quite horrifying, also. My problem with the movie is its lack of details of the campaign.  How did the German army get surrounded?  The Soviets launched Operation 'Uranus,' but that is not explained in the film.  Hitler's stubborness and unwillingness to let his soldiers surrender is also not explored very well, and this is a very significant aspect of the battle of Stalingrad.  We also see the soldiers suffer, however, it is not done effectively enough.  The film also doesn't explain why the battle of Stalingrad was so important--this film could have been the same almost anywhere on the eastern front, during winter. If you're interested in the war, then you might as well see it.  Hopefully we will someday see a film from the Russian point of view of this battle.",Null,0,0,12 December 1999
Enemy at the Gates," Good, but too narrow for its subject (Spoilers, of course.)
","I had been looking forward to this movie ever since I first heard about it, but I also suspected that this story of Vasilly Zaitsev (Jude Law) the sniper was too small for the backdrop of Stalingrad.  I found that in my eyes my suspicions were correct, however 'Enemy at the Gates' is still a good production, and worth seeing for fans of history and war films, and probably almost anyone else. The main problem with the film is that its main story is too trivial for the enormous subject it is about.  Stalingrad was probably the most important battle of World War II, and also might have been the largest battle ever fought. The Nazi invasion of Russia would eventually leave over 20 million Russians dead.  Stalingrad ended with the loss of an entire German army, a disaster of such enormous magnitude that even Goebbels' Nazi press didn't try to hide it.  However, `Enemy at the Gates' uses Stalingrad as a backdrop for a story about snipers.    The intro is really powerful, but since these Russian soldiers are being `introduced' to the battle, we don't get the feeling as much as we should that this is a war being fought on their own land.  The film also doesn't present to us how many civilians fought for Stalingrad.  At times it even seems to claim that snipers should be given the most credit for the Russian victory!  It also sometimes seems like the war is very far away, almost as if it was a sporadic inconvenience for the Russians, not the ongoing inferno that Stalingrad was--the battle scenes are very good, but there aren't enough of them, and I would like to have seen more of the fighting that took place in the sewer, and the bombing raids that killed 40,000 civilians in one week.  `Enemy at the Gates' is also flawed by peachiness, and what seems like Annaud's determination to present ambiguity in his material.  An awkward and contrived speech by sniper Koulikov (Ron Perlman), discussing the similarities between Nazism and Communism in a 'Catch-22' sort of way comes off pretty hokey, given the fact that the Red Army was facing an enemy that had been murdering millions of Russian civilians in cold blood.  I also couldn't buy a Russian mother being more satisfied that her son was a traitor over being killed in battle--I think it very unlikely that a political officer would relay such information to a woman to comfort her sorrows.  This solution makes it easier for American audiences to swallow, but doesn't come off very authentic.  Also, heroes like Zaitsev were useful for propaganda purposes, but they were not the sole deciding factor in uplifting morale.  By mid 1942, the Russians proved to be an enormously determined people who were totally at war.  It is true that Red officers would shoot their own men who retreated and those who were trying to surrender, but it is wrong to say that this battle was won simply because soldiers were forced to fight fearing death from both directions.I guess I must keep in mind that an epic that would explore all of the aspects of Stalingrad, on a sort of 'GETTYSBURG' type scale is highly unlikely, and I should probably be happy with what has been presented.  I must say that what is focused on is very well done.  The battle scenes are powerful, and filled with carnage and realism.  It was thrilling and horrifying as Zaitsev waited among his comrades in a boat, while Stuka dive-bombers strafed, destroyed, and killed the unfortunate people and boats beneath them.  Every bombing scene is in fact, pretty intense.  The production designers must be commended in their terrific presentation of the embattled city.  The best scene in my opinion is probably Zaitsev's introduction to Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) in the fountain.  Here, Zaitsev first displays to us his talent as a sniper, cooly and calmly picking off high ranking officers, and soldiers a few ranks beneath them--it is filled with suspense and gives us a guilty respect for his excellent marksmanship.  Many people are criticizing the love story, involving Tania (Rachel Weisz), but I didn't mind it.  I actually found the sex scene between the two lovers to be surprisingly passionate and realistic given the situation.  The main plot, the battle between the snipers is very engaging, although it isn't perfect.  Zaitsev often worries about his abilities, but history has not described him in this way.  Antony Beevor's excellent book, `Stalingrad' (which I would highly recommend to anyone interested in the Ostfront or WWII) describes him as somewhat arrogant, and says that he claimed he would reach 150 kills before the war ended (he reached 149).  Beevor also states that since the very complete Soviet records never mentioned anything about Zaitsev's duel with a German sharpshooter, this story is probably false.  SPOILER WARNING; DO NOT READ ANY FURTHER IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE!The original `legend' describes Heinz Thorvald (`Konig' in the movie) being tricked into thinking he has killed Zaitsev.  This does happen in the film. However, instead of emerging to find his supposed slain enemy, like Ed Harris did in the movie, it was believed that Thorvald peeped his head up from his scope, exposing himself to Zaitsev, who seized the opportunity and shot Thorvald in the head.  I prefer what happened in the legend as opposed to what happened in the film, and I'm not sure why Annaud chose to depict the climax this way.Overall, `Enemy at the Gates' is a good, engaging movie.  Jude law is excellent as the lead, and most of the supporting cast do well with their roles.  The production values and realistic battle sequences are jarring and memorable.  I just wish that it had explored the Battle of Stalingrad in a much broader scope.  Grade: B",Null,0,0,23 March 2001
Rosemary's Baby," This one gave me nightmares
","I found this film disturbingly scary on a level I'd compare to 'The Exorcist.'  It won't affect everyone the same way--I've yet to see a decent horror film that didn't terrify one viewer and humorously amuse another with indifference.  But this one should affect anyone with an active imagination. Imagination is what makes this film so disturbing.  I know it is a cliche to say that 'less is more,' and that scenes of horror that are 'implied' are more successful than those that show it explicitly.  But 'Rosemary's Baby' does more than that--it almost displays everything that is happening in front of us in a banal way, so that we accept it at face value, without shock, until it is too late.  The story starts out rather happily, and non-threatening.  A young, attractive couple is searching for an apartment in New York City.  They meet an old, eccentric couple living in the apartment above them who seem rather intrusive and annoying, but we accept these characteristics as the affects of aging and loneliness.  A series of strange events occur, some of them involving deaths.  But we are not frightened by any of them yet.  They accelerate rapidly until the now pregnant Rosemary is obviously in great danger, and so is her unborn baby.  There is a conspiracy against her, but it still is not clear exactly who is involved, who she can trust, and who is leading it.  The answers are right in front of us the whole time, with a final twist that is as disturbing as those from the 'great shockers' of recent films, including 'The Sixth Sense,' 'Fight Club,' and 'The Others,' yet it is not as abrupt.  This is because the story builds to the climax without really hiding much, for the film uses our assumptions against us. The elderly couple CAN'T be poisoning Rosemary could they?  Rosemary's husband HAS to be the one person she can rely on, right?  Rosemary's nightmare that seemed 'so real' was just a nightmare, wasn't it? 
SPOILERS AHEAD***The vague glimpses of Satan himself fornicating with the heroine are not evident to us until much later.  When we see a group of elderly, seemingly innocuous nude people gathering around and commenting on what is happening, we at first refuse to take it at face value.  After all, it is not just these weird people we see, Rosemary's husband is there (John Cassavettes, 'Franco,' from 'The Dirty Dozen.')  Cassavettes actually turns out to be, in my opinion, the most evil character here--so self-serving that he actually sells his wife's womb just to further his career.  The final scene is somewhat campy, but isn't any less frightening.  It is also interesting to see that the people involved in this cult of witches ('All of them Witches') are really, at heart, 'normal' elderly people, who knit, tell lots of boring stories, enjoy having visitors out of loneliness, etc.--they just worship Satan!  ***END SPOILERSIn general, I think this film is definitely worth seeing.  How one will react to it is a different story.  I found the grainy film, toned-down special effects (the snake-eyes were very effective), the leisurely pace, and the old-fashioned style of directing by Roman Polansky to be the key factors in the success of this film as a horror movie, or 'thriller.'  All of these elements make us think and force us to use our imagination, and then shudder with revulsion, and the end result seems very real.  If you agree on the success of these elements, watch the film, but be cautious, after all, I again admit that at 28, I had nightmares after seeing it... Grade: A.",Null,5,8,3 November 2002
Vanilla Sky," Cameron Crowe Fails (Spoilers, of course)
","I know that 'Vanilla Sky' is supposed to be a remake of 'Abre Los Ojos,' which I haven't seen.  But I think Cameron Crowe was more influenced by other films and trends when he made this film.It is usually a good thing for directors to step outside their boundaries, and experiment with new techniques, material, and subject matter.  But it doesn't always work.  I am not the biggest fan of Cameron Crowe.  I wasn't impressed by 'Jerry Maguire,' which was overly long and clichéd, nor by 'Almost Famous,' which I found slow and uninvolving (although I know I am clearly alone here.)  But I know there was something about these two films that audiences and critics loved, which probably had to do with the amount of heart that Crowe put into them.  I could definitely see Crowe's passion in this movie, but it didn't mean the movie was a success.'Vanilla Sky' plays like bunch of sampled techniques from films that are superior in their experimentation.  It seems that Crowe wanted to make his 'Requiem for a Dream,' 'Fight Club,' or 'The Devil's Advocate.'  The crafts that he borrows are tired now, and the film never appears like anything more than a failure and exploitation of these methods.  The quick cuts, splices, and camera tricks have no punch and fail to grab us.  The numerous twists and eventual copouts offered by the plot never have any impact.  The film starts out coherently, but I found the first half hour to be just awful--for some reason, in this and the other Crowe films I have mentioned, I was totally uninvolved in the story.  I found Tom Cruise's character to be really dull and he left me detached from his interactions with Penelope Cruz.  I never felt like I knew who these two characters were or why I should care (or not care) about them.  The 'car crash' sequence interrupts the weary story but isn't anything special, and I found Cameron Diaz' performance to be too much on the campy side.  Many have commended the opening dream sequence, which shows us an empty Times Square in New York City.  But I found that it irritatingly resembled an internet or cell phone commercial.  There really isn't any imagination to the brief sequence--we have already seen empty streets of once busy places to fill us in that 'this is a dream'--the fact that it's Times Square just reminds us that there are thousands of frustrated New Yorkers waiting off camera to go about their business.  The scenes involving Cruise's irritation with his broken face are gruesome, but not disturbing enough to equal good moviemaking.  These moments are sometimes humorous, and the final sequence is photographed very well, but the answers of the movie are unsatisfying, and make questions and plot points presented earlier in the film irrelevant.Cameron Crowe was passionate about this film, but this just isn't his field.

Any Given Sunday," Worth a look, but you're better off watching a real game.
","What seemed like a great combination, Oliver Stone and football, unfortunately produced pretty mediocre results.  A real football game is much more entertaining--if you ever have to chose between the two there should be no question.Stone never really lets us 'see' a game.  He puts us on the playing field, to give us a realistic, shocking, jarring experience that real football players endure, in between cuts to the scoreboard.  This works at times, since one of the movie's main themes is the serious injury that football players risk every game they play, all for money, fame, and the fans.  But this is all that Stone really gives us concerning the football sequences. The more recent high school/tolerance film 'Remember the Titans' actually gave us better football sequences, with a better understanding of strategy, plays, and action.From what I understand, Oliver Stone tried to get the permission of the NFL to use real logos and team names, and he was unsuccessful.  This unfortunately lead to what is possibly the movie's greatest weakness--the fictional uniforms.  This is actually much more important than it might appear; A team's logo and look are critical to team sales, and sales are also important to a team's success.  The uniforms in this movie are ugly, dull, and poorly contrasted--they are distracting and don't look like NFL uniforms picked by researchers at all, but more like the work of a production designer given only a matter of weeks to decide on every team's appearance.  This contributes to the huge fantasy world that this film takes place in, with fictional cities and team names as well, and it all results in a setting that is unbelievable.The movie has a somewhat decent script, and performances by Jaime Fox, Dennis Quaid, and Al Pacino are all pretty good.  The supporting cast is also quite colorful and entertaining to watch.  If you're a football fan or an admirer of Oliver Stone, then it's worth a look, but not if there is a real football game on!

Munich," Enjoyed the movie, disagreed with the message.
","Spielberg has described 'Munich' as his 'prayer for peace,' and that theme has overshadowed most of the real events this film is based on. It tries to see the actions of both sides, Israeli commandos and Palestinian terrorists, as equal. This brings down the film in an idealistic and preachy way.When I first heard about this film, I was very excited that Spielberg would be directing it. I thought he could bring attention to the way Israelis have suffered under terrorism in the way he brought attention to the holocaust in 'Schindler's List.' Most of what I know about the Munich massacre and its aftermath comes from Aaron J. Klein 's 'Striking Back,' one of the most recent studies of the affair. What that work states is that the targets of 'Munich' were high profile PLO members. The Israelis were anxious to fight offensively, not defensively, against Arab terrorists. Most of their targets did not have a direct hand in planning Munich. But in the film Eric Bana's 'Avner' is not informed of this until the end, and it is presented to us as if the Israeli government is being shady, just eliminating people it had old rivalries with. The purpose of these assassinations was 1. to prevent terrorists from committing future attacks, 2.to deter terrorists by making them feel unsafe, wherever they were by knowing that while they sought the murder of Jews, they too could never sleep soundly at night, and 3. revenge.'Munich' doesn't express well enough the motives for the reprisal killings, and the Israelis who take part in the operations are depicted as too somber and glum--Israel could not survive if its agents and leaders acted this way. Israeli prime minister Golda Meir, in the film, states the film's often quoted line, 'Every civilization finds it necessary to negotiate compromises with its own values.' In reality, Meir knew well that the perpetrators needed to be hunted down and punished, mercilessly. The impact of the targeted killings, especially the operation 'Spring of Youth' in Lebanon, is not given proper significance in the film. 'Munich' implies that each of these missions was a bloody, unnecessary mess that lead to more tit-for-tat violence. 'Spring of Youth' made Israel's enemies look at the Mossad with tremendous fear and awe; that Israeli agents could hunt down and kill supreme heads of the PLO in an Arab country, while their targets lay in their own beds. The 'deterrence' motive definitely seems to have been achieved by these operations. Although controversial, 'targeted killings' have proved to be very effective. Israel brings the threat of death to those who plan terrorist attacks, and as a result, the terrorists spend 90% of their time hiding and only 10% of their time planning attacks. Avner says in the film, 'Those we killed are being replaced by worse.' This is a myth held by the world. True, everyone is replaceable, but often when a highly experienced, skilled, and charismatic Arab terrorist is killed, his replacement is a young person who can't understand the intructions of his weapons because they are in Farsi. Targeted kills are a blow to their organizations, and it is particularly demoralizing to terrorists when their 'best' leaders are elminated.My other complaint about 'Munich' is that it feels rushed. Spielberg needed to slow down here, and he should have story-boarded the film. The Munich massacre is sped through too quickly, and there should have been more about how the Germans, with no anti-terror squad at the time, maddeningly bungled the rescue mission of the athletes. What Spielberg instead focused on was the violence (this is one of his bloodiest and most gruesome films to date). The final sequences, involving a concoction of scenes of Abner having rough, sweaty sex with his wife and the murder of the athletes, is bizarre and does not sit well. Many might find it offensive.What do I like about the film? Well, at least Spielberg tried to make a personal film about the conflict. You can tell that his heart goes out to both sides in an idealistic way. The cinematography, lighting, set pieces, vehicles and costume design appear authentic and dead-on. It has a suspenseful opening and tense moments throughout. It is skillfully cast and all the actors do very well--especially Eric Bana, Geoffrey Rush, Omar Metwally, and Daniel Craig, who needed more scenes. Craig is the toughest, most gung-ho character and has the more memorable lines in the film, like 'Don't f**k with the Jews,' and 'The only blood I care about is Jewish blood.' The movie gives us great exotic locales and interesting character faces, and a noir-ish feel with a look into a shadowy world of espionage. The film seems at times more about the toll taken on government agents who do hard and ugly things loyally for their governments than about Israel and the Palestinians.What we have in the end is a film that wears its heart on its sleeve. It is Spielberg's 'prayer for peace,' with some loss in accuracy as a casualty. Grade: B.",7,1,5,3 November 2007
The Thin Red Line," Too choppy and unfocused despite its potential
","I was disappointed with this film when it first came out, but a recent viewing on DVD mad me enjoy it more.The movie is beautifully photographed.  Malick has a great eye for visuals, and not just for the scenery and pretty colors.  He knows how to compose a shot.  Like any Stanley Kubrick film, press pause anywhere during this movie and you have a brilliant picture.  The movie has an excellent and haunting score, accompanied by effective narration.  The war scenes are great in most cases (especially the ones on the hill.)  Some solid characters also.  The landing on a Guadalcanal beach, with landing craft and airplanes is spectacular, accompanied by impressive sound.Unfortunately, many of the film's flaws didn't go away the second time.  It dwindles on things too much, especially the scenes of one character's gorgeous wife back home.  It moves very slowly at times, although I was able to forgive that after the first viewing.  It slows down near the end, however, when the movie should be speeding up.  It's biggest, most obvious shortcoming is the choppiness of what is rumored to be a five plus hour epic shortened to three; stories start but then drop off suddenly, and this is true of some of the most interesting ones.  The best story (in my opinion) involved an almost father-son like relationship between Nick Nolte and John Cusak, but it just ended and never came back.  Many actors had much bigger roles in the original cut.  There are many characters that a viewer could mix up, since they may look similar and have the same amount of screen time. I am a fan of war films, and would be interested in viewing the final cut. But most people wouldn't, and this puts the director in a situation he could not win, and the film is, sad to say, in the end, a failure.See it for certain sequences, especially if you're a war movie fan (the film seems pretty accurate, although I thought that Japanese soldiers usually fought to the death at this time, and rarely surrendered).  Lastly, this film is nothing like Saving Private Ryan, and should not be compared to it. Since it so often is, however, I would like to say that someone who claims that TRL is better than SPR is most likely either, A.)trying to prove that they are unconventional, or B.)unsophisticated and trying to prove that they are sophisticated.",7,2,5,27 December 1999
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Disappointing
","I loved the first two films of the Indiana Jones trilogy and was extremely disappointed with this one when it first came out, for several reasons. First of all, the opening is one of the most contrived and unbelievable things I've ever seen.  It's as if the producers said, 'Okay, we need a way for young I.J. to find his hat, his whip, the scar on his chin, the way he dresses, his fear of snakes, and his search for adventure all in ten minutes!'Some of the special effects in this film are horrible--there is no explanation for the pathetic giant B-movie snake that opens its mouth and attacks young Indy.  Sometimes the camera angles aren't wide enough, either. The fake-looking rhino that rams it's horn into the roof is shot way too close.  This is also true of some of the scenes inside the tank, later. The angles are so tight you can only get a  vague idea of what's going on.In accordance with the first two films, I don't buy the relationship with Indy and his father.  He never mentions his father in the other films (because the writers hadn't thought of him yet) and in 'Raiders,' Indy mentions his mother to Marcus.  It is stated in this movie that she died while Indy was young.  Indy's character seems slightly different in this movie as opposed to the other films.  Marcus Brody, an intelligent and interesting (although short on screen time) character in 'Raiders' is reduced to a goof-ball who clowns around and gets into trouble for humor's sake.My biggest complaint with 'Last Crusade' is its lack of punch as a supposed thrill-packed adventure film.  It is extremely lacking in almost every aspect.  Every action scene is over almost as quickly as it had started. Indy and his father get out of everything way too easily, whether it be landing a plane, boat chases, correctly selecting the right grail, or escaping Nazi-war planes.  The tank battle sequence is the most impressive of the movie, although it is lackluster compared to anything in 'Raiders' or 'Temple of Doom.'  Vogel makes a pretty nasty Nazi, but the rest of the villains are boring.  Donovan is just another traitorous man in a suit, strait out of a television murder mystery.  Ilsa isn't very vicious as a villain, or charismatic as a love interest.  Kazim just spouts prophecies at Indy on the brink of death.  Where are great villains like Belloq, Toht, or Mola Ram when you need them?The movie does insult your intelligence more than the other two.  For example, why does Vogel fire a pistol at Indy while he's inside a TANK? Why does Donovan drink from the first grail before anyone else does, without testing it on anyone first, and why does he take Ilsa's word?  'Shooting ME won't get you anywhere,' Indy contrivedly tells Donovan, giving the villain the opportunity to shoot his father.  While both of the first films had magic and supernatural elements, the scene at the end with the 1000 year old crusader really pushes it.I recently watched this film with a close friend, a fan of the first two who hadn't seen 'Crusade' yet.  Halfway through it, he turned to me and said, 'Let's watch one of the other ones.'  That would have been a good idea.",3,22,58,9 October 1999
Jurassic Park," Spectacular Adventure from the Master Storyteller
","Rarely will a film capture my imagination and lose me in its own world. Jurassic Park is one of them.  After seeing the mosquito-in-amber trailer, I read the book and couldn't wait for the movie.Spielberg was the only choice to direct this film.  He has one of the best and most recognizable styles of all directors.  From the opening moments, he leaves the audience knowing that a fantastic adventure will soon take place. He learned suspense from the best, and perfects it.  I loved the first scene on Isla Nublar, with the Raptor being transported to its holding pen. We don't see the animal, however, we really get the feeling that there is something horribly vicious inside!  We also get this feeling from the scene where the visitors witness the slaughter of a bull by raptors.  Spielberg does this with his lighting and sound effects, along with expertly paced editing.  When, after much suspense, he does show us the carnivorous dinosaurs, they are terrifying.  The T-Rex scene is a classic!  It is extremely intense and scary. This movie has almost everything.  It has a great story, a great concept, and thrills galore.  What I guess it does lack the most is characterization, and although the characters are one-dimensional, they are brought to life well enough to tell the story.  My favorite character in the book and the movie was Muldoon (the big game hunter), although in the novel he didn't suffer the same fate as he did in the movie.  It still is a very good adaptation of Crichton's novel, and holds its own if you haven't read it. You can't have a summer without movies like this!  Grade; A.",10,1,2,12 June 2000
