Ali," real Ali absent
","I recall all the phases of Ali's career.  This good movie does not come close to recreating the excitment of this man's achievements.  The actor's delivery is wooden and lacks the sparkle of Ali's tirades. To those who are too young to have followed his career, believe me, Ali is a much much more powerful figure than what appears in this film.  For one thing, his characteristic mischievousness is not evident in the film.  Just looking at Ali made you feel good and happy (except if you were in the ring with him, I'm sure!)I found that Ali's opponents were incredibly well casted. Howard Cosell is brilliantly interpreted. And I also found that the fight scenes were extremely well done.  No phony Rocky slug fest here.Very enjoyable movie.  But Ali, you are the greatest, and nobody can do you. Ever.",5,0,0,11 January 2002
The Bourne Identity," litmus test movie
","This film, along with Enough, are what I call litmus test films in my search for movie reviewers on which I can rely. I use excruciatingly, no-doubt-about-it, obviously bad films as litmus tests in my evaluation of reviewers. This movie is an excellent test instrument.Apart from spectacular views of Paris, there is very little entertainment in this badly directed movie where everything seems to be out of sync. . . In a negative way, it is everything OO7 films were not.Mark The Reviewer, you made out list.The lady from the Washington Post (Dasson?), you are forever off it.",4,1,3,14 June 2002
Jarhead," A narrow view of a large calamity
","While my wife and I found the film interesting and worth the time and expense to view it, we also found it to be lacking in an important way.Whether this was the intent or not, this film will be viewed by many as an insight into what the war in the Persian Gulf was. By focusing exclusively on the impact of the war on the lives of American soldiers, we are again presented with an incomplete view of a real event. A view that reiterates the hopefully false impression that the importance of any event is the impact that it has on the United States or its citizens.One of the major impacts of the war in Iraq is the calamity that it has brought to the Iraqui population (whether or not it was for their own good is not the point). This essential dimension is totally absent from the film. In fact, I recollect less than 10 Arabs portrayed in that film (unless you count the corpses). If the impact of the war on the general population was not an important consideration in the soldiers' reaction to their war experience, this in itself is a highly revealing fact that needs to be presented.In order to understand my concern about this film, imagine that someone made a film about the bombing of Germany and focused nearly exclusively on the experiences of the bomber pilots without covering in any way the impact of this bombing on the general population. Such a film would quite rightly be considered deeply flawed, no matter your opinion on the culpability of the German populace with respect to Nazi crimes. If the pilots had not been concerned about the negative side effects of their actions (they were), that is an important dimension that would have needed to be presented.",4,0,2,11 November 2005
Enchanted," Undescribable awfulness
","How can I describe the awfulness of this movie? Cliché-ridden? Yes. Dull? Yes. Unimaginative? Yes. Predictable? Yes. Unfunny? Yes.But it is even worse than that. After about 40 minutes of this inane story, I looked at my watch, and we were only about 10 minutes in this dragging film. After about 30 minutes, my wife said to me 'I am so relieved that YOU picked it!' What else is awful about it? The music! A pale, pale, pale, pale attempt at imitating a 1950's musical. Sorry, I was around when the 1950 musicals came out, and they were nothing like this uninspired version. Who would want to listen again to ANY of the boring lyrics of ANY of the songs in this movie! Pity the poor sound editor of this movie who had to listen to them again and again.What else is awful? Well, many things. The chipmunk scenes, for instance. Who wants to spend any part of his or her time on Earth watching a chipmunk do a charade ? And then later in the film, do ANOTHER one! A critic wrote that Walt Disney would be proud of this film. This is what made me suggest to my wife that we should see it as our Friday-night-at-the-movies selection. Au contraire, there is nothing of the genius of the original Disney films in this very limp version of a fairy tale. I think he would be appalled. Incompetence must not be rewarded. Don't go and see it. André",2,24,52,14 December 2007
Moulin Rouge!," A noisy, witless film
","Unless you are craving to hear people screaming at each other or to sit through unimaginative choreography for two hours, avoid this disjointed cinematic contraption involving one of the least photogenic support cast I ever recall seeing on screen.  Not only are they not a pleasant sight, but the director insists on constantly filling the screen with their grimacing faces. How much teeth, gums, tongue and bulging eyeballs can one stand ? The storyline is insipid, the acting mechanical, the editing choppy and distracting.One thing is certain in my mind:  if Moulin Rouge had offered the kind of noisy and uninspired music heard on this film, the chances are very slim that it would have been the setting for a film a century later.",Null,0,0,1 June 2001
Mulholland Drive," A dream best left untold.
","Can anything be more boring than having to listen to someone describe a dream he or she had recently?  ( 'And then, I... and then she....and then it....and then he ...and then I...and then she...and then he...')Not until this film was made.",3,0,2,24 November 2001
The Last Samurai," Charge of the lightweight brigade
","Most Americans I know are polite, honest, decent people wishing nothing but good things for other people.But the Americans I so often see on the screen are portrayed as violent, know-it-all, stronger-than-everybody-else, gross, ignorant-and-proud-of-it trailer trash kind of folks.  The Last Samurai continues in this tradition. With his trademark open-mouthed stares into space, this little man (Tom Cruise) who has the stage presence of a soap opera stand-in, is constantly trying to fit into shoes that are way too big for him.
It was hard throughout the long series of scenes to contain our laughter. (Spoiler) It was impossible to do so when in the last moments of the film, this little guy from good ol' USA crawls in,  all patched up after being repeatedly sworded and shot multiple times by a  battery of Gatling guns. He makes an inarticulate plea to the Emperor, who tear in eye, decides on the spot to change the course of Japanese history.  And Hi'o, Tonto, away....!!!If I were an American, I would be embarassed by this kind of self congratulating idiocy.",3,1,3,6 December 2003
Life Is Beautiful," An unfunny, offensive and generally bad film
","In my view this is an awful film. Cliché ridden, woeful acting, idiotic storyline. Does anybody honestly believe that this otherwise smart kid would continue to believe the stupid story about the point gathering game ? Did we lose something in the subtitles ?This is a totally unfunny comedy (unless one thinks that falling on the floor or getting an egg squashed on one's head is absolutely hilarious. I used to but I haven't for more years than I care to count.)In my view, associating slapstick (and bad slapstick at that) with something as tragic as the holocaust borders on blasphemy. I felt sick in seeing this giggling buffoon prancing around trying to get a laugh in a concentration camp decor.Throughout the presentation, I couldn't make up my mind whether that main actor reminded me more of Jerry Lewis at his worst or of one of the three Stooges, except that the latter comedians did at times succeed in making people of their era laugh. They did not always take for granted that laughter being contagious, all one has to do is giggle intermittently and the laughs will follow.And no, the short scene depicting the bodies does NOT make up for the general lack of sensitivity displayed in the other 99.999% of this movie. In fact, this scene seems totally out of place in the storyline, as if the actor had mistakenly walked off the set. ...As if the ballet dancer had stepped on your toe.",2,6,14,26 February 1999
Love Actually," a FUN movie
","What a wonderful way to spend two hours!  The cast is superb, the humour is side splitting, the plot ridiculous, the movie spendid.AND no jiggly handheld camera work to distract us from the screen action!Bravo!  Encore!",9,0,2,22 November 2003
