Alien 3," A sequel that isn't possible!!!!!!
","At the end of the second Alienfilm 'Aliens' the queen alien lost her eggsack when she began chasing Ripley. So, when the queen was on the ship and finally blown out of an airlock, she couldn't plant another egg in the ship that leaves the mothership in Alien 3. Unless it is possible for the queen to create an egg without the sack (that's something I haven't heard about or seen in the movie). Anyway, to me this movie was just not possible because of this and therefore a total waste of money.",6,6,8,4 August 1999
Alien: Resurrection," Better than Alien 3!!!!!!
","I had a lot of doubts about this movie. Would it be just as worse (or worser) as Alien 3? As a matter of fact, this one was far better than the third Alienfilm although I found it to be the most gory and hard (there's lots of violence) of the four movies that are out now. The story was great (only if you see my comment on Alien 3, not possible) and the movie was visually stunning (beautiful sets etc.).",Null,0,0,4 August 1999
Alien," Great Horror-/SF-movie!!!!!!
","If you haven't seen this film yet, go and see it now! The whole looks Ridley Scott gave this movie is excellent (very dark, horrifying, very scary music etc.). The second best, for me, out of the four movies that are out now.",9,0,1,4 August 1999
54," Pretty good movie
","When I went to this movie, I went with the feeling 'it probably is a movie kind a like Saturday Night Fever'. Well, I was pretty right. Most of the actors did a good job, but I thought Philippe (Shane) wasn't that great. Mike Myers, au contraire, played one of his best roles. The film gives a more than average view about studio 54. The film isn't as far as great as Boogie Nights, but that's because this is a slightly different movie. The best scenes of this movie were to me Steve Rubell rolling in his own money totally stoned and of the world (a very vulgar scene). The last scene where you see Steve Rubell on the stage looking over the dancing people and you can see in his eyes that the party was over, that was a great scene. My final remark, a pretty enjoyable movie!",7,0,0,29 April 1999
The Truman Show," Incredible movie!!!!
","Jim Carrey in his best movie until know. 'The Cable Guy', one of the most underestimated movie, and 'Liar, Liar' were also great but this one really hits the top. This is a movie that will keep you thinking!!!!",10,0,0,10 February 1999
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Best one of the Trilogy
","The fourth Star Wars movie was great because of the story and groundbreaking special effects. The second instalment had even more than the first film. The special effects, especially the asteroid belt sequence and the Hoth battle astonish me every time I watch the movie. Also this movie is much more darker than the first one because of the plot of course, Darth Vader is Luke Skywalker's father, amazing!!!! It's one hell of a rollercoaster ride, great!!!!",10,0,1,10 February 1999
