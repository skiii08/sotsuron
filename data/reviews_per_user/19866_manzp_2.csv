The Blair Witch Project," The Blair Witch Project holds my title for the worst movie ever made.
","For years, I considered Tentacles (from the seventies) to be the worst movie ever made.     However, it was easily beat out by The Blair Witch Project. Although the movie was supposed to cast a feeling of being acted by amateurs, it came across as having been produced by amateurs.     But don't let the poor production, direction, editing and such take away from the acting; it was awful as well.    I have no problem with some profanity here and there, but in this case it was there for no other reason than to be 'cool'.    To me the amazing part is that so many kids were taken in by it.",1,2,5,4 June 2000
The Transporter," Great action, fun movie, stupid music.
","I really enjoyed this movie.    Even with the incredible amount of unbelievability, it was engrossing.     I guess I am becoming an old fogey because when the cool techno music switched to 'rap' noise, I became quite irritated and distracted from the actual movie.   I thought Qi Shu was outstanding; I am looking forward to seeing her in future films. Statham did a fine job as well.I would have given it an even higher rating than I did if it weren't for the annoying 'noise'.",7,0,0,13 November 2002
