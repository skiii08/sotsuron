The Expendables 2," Explosive !
","In this second installment of The Expendables series, Stallone and company include a few former action heroes to create quite an ensemble cast. As he has done in the past, Stallone's sequels set out to top the original and he has succeeded here as well. What makes this film and it's predecessor enjoyable and somewhat unique is the fact that Stallone's character (Barney Ross) is a member of a team as opposed to a one-man wrecking crew like Rambo and Cobra. The plot here is very similar to the first film but the action and flow seem to be increased. Jean Claude Van Damm turns in a very convincing performance as a villainous arms dealer. The humor here is also escalated further than the first film. 
If you're fan of action movies with war as the backdrop, you will probably enjoy this film very much. It's simply entertainment. Nothing more, nothing less !",10,0,0,11 January 2018
The Expendables," Action for Action-Lovers
","For the trivia enthusiasts out there : Barney Ross was actually a professional prize fighter in the 1940's who held titles in 3 different classes. 
As for this film : The best way for me to describe it would be like listening to 2 opposing arguments about professional wrestling. One would be that it's mindless and lacking any authenticity. The other would be that it's simply entertainment. Nothing more. Nothing less. 
If you're a fan of this genre, you will probably enjoy this film a great deal. The crew assembled around Barney Ross (Stallone) seems very team-oriented and operate like a well-oiled machine. Eric Roberts turns in a convincing performance as an international villain. What Stallone has managed to do here is expand the tongue-in-cheek action film like he did in Demolition Man. He brings in all sorts of action heroes who actually make fun of their own films in the course of the dialogue. The hand-to-hand combat scenes are incredible and well choreographed. In general, this is an action film not to be taken seriously at all but still viewed closely.
My only regret about the plot itself is that there is no explanation as to how this team gets assembled, what Ross and his teammates did before becoming 'The Expendables', etc. It simply begins with them venturing out on their first mission. But that's just a minor point. 
Again, if you're a fan of Rambo, Terminator, Die Hard, etc., just sit back, relax and enjoy an action-packed adventure. My personal favorite is Jason Statham as 'Lee Christmas'.",10,0,0,9 January 2018
Taxi Driver," A Cult Classic
","While not the greatest storyline in history, this film has stood the test of time as a true cult classic. Many colleges use this film in Arts courses to display and analyze how well it is actually pieced together. The acting and script are very convincing but where it fails is in the actual storyline (which isn't really much). One of the most outstanding features of this sophomore Scorcese effort is that it introduces us to 2 future mega-stars in Robert DeNiro and Jodie Foster. Also of note are the supporting performances of Harvey Keitel, Peter Boyle, and Cybil Sheppard. Albert Brooks also turns in a short but very convincing performance. The most memorable of all scenes in this movie is the 'you talking' to me' mirror scene which has been duplicated many times in both television and film.",7,0,0,10 March 2015
American Beauty," Where's 'The Beauty' (or storyline for that matter)?
","I have to agree with those IMDb reviewers who simply cannot understand how this movie won the Best Picture award or for that matter, how it is even considered a good film. It's nothing more than an overblown, exaggerated view of a dysfunctional family set to the backdrop of a suburban lifestyle that, for the most part, seems totally unrealistic. While Kevin Spacey usually turns in consistent performances (although he always seems to play rather offbeat characters), I felt his performance here was very weak. He plays a middle-aged man going through his midlife crisis period but to me, just seems unconvincing. Even Annette Benning's performance seemed way below par. Quite frankly, definitely not worthy of Best Picture and not one that I would want to own.",1,10,18,11 March 2015
Heartbreak Ridge," Very unique !
","As far as I know, this is the only movie that focuses on the rescue mission in Grenada in 1983. Although there are a few geographical, continuity, and factual errors in this film, it's one of those movies that just seems to get better each with each viewing. Some of the supporting acting is a bit weak, but Clint Eastwood, Marsha Mason, and Arlen Dean Snyder turn in very convincing and well-portrayed character performances. The role of Gunnery Sergeant Tom Highway was chosen by Eastwood at the exact perfect point in his film career. Particularly impressive are the quotes throughout this film. It's just one of those movies to sit back and enjoy.",9,0,2,3 September 2015
Apocalypse Now," Outstanding ! !
","This is my favorite of all the Vietnam era movies and maybe the best war film of all time. Though a surrealistic storyline, the backdrop of the Viet Nam war becomes the perfect setting for this adventure based on the novel 'Heart of Darkness' The acting is superb and the cinematography is exquisite. Every performance in this movie is top notch. It may be Martin Sheen's best performance ever. A well-chosen soundtrack and a very well written screenplay. Memorable for many lines such as Duvall's 'I love the smell of napalm in the morning'. Brando's performance in this film is simply awesome. Another Coppola masterpiece which took 16 months to film. To this day, I still believe that this film contains the best opening scene in the history of filmmaking!",9,0,2,9 March 2015
Casualties of War," DePalma at his absolute worst !
","I have to agree with the other reviewers who asked : 'How could this movie have possibly been made?'. This piece of absolute trash really says a lot for the many brave American soldiers (men and women) who faithfully served our country throughout the Viet Nam war. The story centers on the rape and eventual murder of an innocent Vietnamese child by 4 American soldiers who were refused leave. Who in their right mind would want to make a movie like this? The performances are just awful and totally unrealistic. Sean Penn is his usual unconvincingly terrible and casting Michael J Foxx in a war film is about as convincing as casting Stan Laurel in the lead role of Rocky ! I just fail to see how portraying American GIs as low-life rapists and murderers serves as quality entertainment. Very unconvincing acting, an awful plot, and totally off-center directing make this film the very bottom of the heap for me. One I would never recommend nor want to see again. Very disturbing junk. DePalma was really out of his element on this one and should have been court-martial-ed for this movie. It makes our Viet Nam GIs look like the Russian soldiers who served under Stalin during World War 2.",1,7,31,17 March 2015
Once Upon a Time in America," Not Even Close. Leone Fails.
","Of all the entries in the gangster/mob genre, this one is by far, my least favorite. The drawn-out, extended opening of this film sets the stage for a rather lengthy (more than 3 and 1/2 hours) and far-fetched story about the rise of Jewish mobsters in New York City. Although a huge fan of his, I have to admit that this is one film where Robert DeNiro just does not seem to fit. While James Woods turns in a competent performance, he too just seems a bit over the top and unconvincing. The rest of the cast, as well, while convincing at certain points, doesn't seem to gel and many of the scenes should have been shortened or deleted completely. The storyline is poor and leaves nothing memorable. Clearly, this is one genre where Sergio Leone just does not belong.",1,7,21,9 March 2015
Pulp Fiction," Pulp Trash
","I have to agree with those reviewers that find this film disjointed, overly and unnecessarily violent, and just plain difficult to understand. I, for one, fail to see how this movie resurrected the career of John Travolta as his performance was just totally unbelievable. Focusing on what appears to be several unrelated life experiences, Tarrantino once again utilizes his penchant for violence, drug addiction, rape, and other assorted seedy topics. The plot (if you want to call it that) is non-existent and the scene involving Ving Rhaimes is just flat-out disgusting. For Tarrantino fans, this may be the ultimate. But for me, it's just not a good film.",1,58,136,10 March 2015
The Departed," Just didn't get it
","Quite frankly, it took me a few viewings to figure this one out. This movie seemed a bit too long and contained several unnecessary characters and events. Mark Wahlberg's character, in particular , just seemed way over the top and was just plain annoying. I still haven't figured out why this character is even included in this story. As for the other performances, Nicholson seems a bit out of place in this one and Martin Sheen is a little too low-key. I must agree with other reviewers that state that this movie contains way too much information, plot twists, and should have been a lot shorter. I have yet to see the original 'Internal Affairs' but will now seek it out and compare the two. Again, I agree with other reviewers that I just didn't see what the big deal was about this movie. This was not one of Scorsese's best as far as I'm concerned.",3,7,10,9 March 2015
The Silence of the Lambs," An Extremely Well Done Thriller
","This movie has to be one of the most unique and gripping thrillers of all time. Anthony Hopkins' performance raised the bar as to how a villain can be portrayed as he turned in one the greatest performances of all time. His Dr Lecter extended way beyond convincing as he became this character and is considered by many to be the greatest movie villain of all time. It is very difficult for me to visualize any other actor in this role. Jodie Foster also turns in an outstanding performance as Agent Starling, an academy student seeking entry into the FBI. The storyline is very original and the supporting cast is simply amazing. While it does center on the deranged minds of 2 killers, this film does not rely on excessive gore, blood, or dismemberment in order to captivate the audience.",9,1,2,11 March 2015
Casino," Good but a bit familiar
","Many reviewers have described this movie as 'Goodfellas Part Two'. While it's difficult to disagree with that assessment, I do feel that this picture has some merit of its own. Like Goodfellas, it is loosely based on a true story which adds some value. The presentation is very similar to Goodfellas but also provides different settings and plot twists. My major criticism is that of the length. It's just too long and contains a lot of unnecessary dialogue and extended scenery. However, Sharon Stone turns in one of the most brilliant performances of her career. All in all, a really good movie. Nothing totally original. But as stated before, a bit too long.",8,0,1,9 March 2015
The Breakfast Club," Dentention Has A New Definition !!
","Quite possibly, this may be the best teen-focused movie in history. The plot is extremely original and the tempo and storyline are just fantastic. Disregarding useless Hollywood monikers (such as 'the brat pack'), each cast member creates a memorable character perception while, at the same time, contributing to a wonderful ensemble effort. Judd Nelson, Emilio Estevez, Anthony Michael Hall, Allie Sheedy, and Mollie Ringwald each turn in what may be the best performances of their respective career. The story centers on a Saturday morning detention session in a Chicago high school involving 5 radically different students each suffering from a unique form of peer pressure. Paul Gleeson turns in a very convincing performance as the detention dean. This film has depth, emotion, humor and a soundtrack that fits to perfection. A must see !!!",9,0,2,13 March 2015
Goodfellas," 'Good But Not Great' Fellas
","I realize that in many circles, this film is considered an absolute classic and possibly Scorsese's greatest. However, over the course of time, my perception of this film has changed. Having read 'Wiseguy' by Nicholas Pileggi, I realized that this movie does not conform to the book all that much and tends to stray a great deal. While most of the performances are memorable, they don't really resemble the actual characters that the story is based on. Joe Pesci's performance seems way over the top to me although certain short scenes of his are hilarious. Overall, I'd say his performance was overacted. DeNiro, Frank Vincent, Lorraine Bracco, and Ray Liotta turn in very convincing performances and Scorsese's approach to this film was very unique and well done. One of the many overlooked features of this movie is the soundtrack. While not quite chronologically correct in some spots, it does tend to emphasize certain scenes. My major criticism of this film is that way too much time in the second half is devoted to Henry's drug problem. I felt that this segment of his life could have been summed up in one or possibly two scenes. But here, almost the entire second half of this movie focuses on Henry's drug addiction and dealing. Not necessary. Another criticism is that the famous 'Lufthansa heist' is only mentioned here and not shown at all. I believe that this, above all, was the centerpiece in the lives of Jimmy Burke and Henry Hill and is not given enough attention. I would have preferred to see more detail about the heist and less about Henry's drug use. Other than that, it's a memorable film and worthy of a few viewings. But as an all-time classic, I don't think so.",7,2,3,1 April 2015
The Godfather," The Greatest Film of All Time ! Period.
","This film contains all the elements of a genuine masterpiece. Its attention to detail, history, and tradition. An absolutely wonderful screenplay. Its comparative closeness to the novel and a storyline which became the template for future stories in this genre. As for the performances: there is not one single character flaw in this entire cast. What continues to amaze me about this film more than any other is the fact that not only were the correct actors and actresses chosen for the roles but that they were each chosen at the perfect point in their respective careers. Throughout this film, there is not one actor nor actress who seems 'too old or young for the part'. Nor does anyone (including an extremely strong Diane Keaton) seem 'out of place' or 'unconvincing'. The plot and storyline could not have been better and this is one film that no matter how many times you've seen it, it still continues to amaze, entertain, and (in some ways) inform. Like some of the classics which preceded it, it holds up very well over time and will probably continue to do so. I currently own on VHS 'The Godfather Saga' (the first 2 movies woven together in chronological order) which is absolutely amazing. It begins with the birth of Vito and ends with the eventual rise of Michael. Although Francis Ford Coppola does not like this version of his epic, I sure wish he would release it on DVD.",10,15,21,24 March 2015
