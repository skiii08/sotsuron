The Expendables 2," Poor story ....less fitting with the ACTION scenes
",What should I say a good try no I think this is a good try from the previous one but overall its SATISFACTORY.........1st of all i still not able to understand what is the actual story of this film.......frankly speaking for me its like combining good quality action scenes together in one film. Though the start is good as it quickly comes to action rather than finding any reason to start with it....and also no signs of anyone from the team getting any sort of single injury or a single bullet shot wound in any action part..........common man we are watching team of people with 60+ age its OK they have been superb action heroes in past but please give some reality to the film. Dialogues are sometimes good but sometimes we cant just understand what they wanted to say....... There were also some pop ups from different actors but cant explain it here as it might become SPOILER......but these pop ups didn't make any connections how they showed up like that :-)..... Nevertheless cutting the long story short.........its a better try from the first part but it could be far more better if things would be handled in a sequential way......cast is looking quite OLD specially ARNOLD and Dolph.... But good expressions and acting shown by SLY and van dame.......... My rating is 3 out of 10 mainly because of the OLD GUNS appearance....,3,5,12,29 August 2012
