Minority Report," An intelligent whiteknuckle ride.
","What do you get if you cross a Hollywood's superstar with a film legend? Answer: one of the greatest action films of all time!  Minority Report has it all - a great cast and crew, an intelligent story line, Steven Spielberg, incredible special effects and some of the best action sequences ever filmed on celluloid. I'm not kidding when I say that it had me on edge of my seat in the first five minutes and kept me there for the entire film. That is pretty rare, considering that most movies struggle to keep the interest of the audience in the second half, but not Minority Report, it just got even more thrilling. Hollywood at it's best. Entertainment at it's best.  Movie directors can learn a lot from Spielberg, it's just a pity he isn't giving lessons, otherwise the audience wouldn't have to sit through films like Rollerball and Jason X. A classic. 10/10.",Null,0,0,26 July 2002
The Others," Good
","Although I did enjoy watching The Others, it did seem a little over rated to me. Apart from the performances and the surprise twist at the end, there wasn't an awful lot to this horror. At no point did I find The Others scary, so fans of ghostly horror movies may be somewhat disappointed with that revelation, nor did I feel that the main characters were ever in any real danger. But as I said before, the acting in this movie is stunning, particulary Kidman's eerie portrayal of the tormented mother. She is, I think, the only true female star left in Hollywood, all the others have either retired or have died from old age. Surprisingly, the children were very good too. Overall, I give this movie a 7.5/10. Worth watching twice",Null,0,0,11 May 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," WOW! WOW! WOW!
","Wow! Lord of the Rings is a wonderful film and a future classic. Unlike many of todays blockbusters (Tomb Raider or Pearl Harbour for example), Lord of the Rings doesn't draw it's power from stunning special effects and beautiful art direction, but rather from the skill and humanity of the lead actors. Incidentally, the film boasts an exceptionally strong cast, but it's Ian McKellen (Gandalf the grey) who stands out amongst the rest. To even conceive a cinematic version of Lord of the Rings trilogy is daunting, not only because it's storytelling on a very grand scale (and definitely not budget friendly!!) but also because Tolkien never fathomed his book as a motion picture and unintentionally made it very difficult to translate his work to the big screen by breaking many of the rules of film making. However, with only a few minor changes Peter Jackson manages to pull a really spectacular film out of his hat. And for this, he is ignored at the Oscars.  Sickening really. The members of the Academy are bunch of cowards, they probably prefered Lord of the Rings over a Beautiful Mind, but as it's a fantasy film felt embarrassed about voting for it.I wholly recommend anyone - not just Tolkien fans - to see this move at least three times. Well worth it!",10,3,4,30 March 2002
Van Helsing," Just okay
","Van Helsing is okay, nothing special. Van Helsing has two main problems, the first of which concerns the clich√© and vastly uninteresting characters. We have seem these types before - the strong, action orientated heroin who eventually gives into her femininity by falling in love with the hero, her equally boring male counterpart! Next time, take out a leaf from Pirates of the Caribbean's book - it was the brilliant Johnny Depp who made POC such a worldwide hit!! Why? Jack Sparrow is unique, hilarious and highly watchable. Also if you are going to stage elaborately expensive action scenes remember to turn on the lights, otherwise the audience will not be able to see what is going on and lose interest!! I hate watching poorly lit action scenes, you barely make out the shapes!!",6,1,2,19 February 2006
Pearl Harbor," Boring
","When I see films like this, it's just another reminder of the greedier side of Hollywood. Bruckheimer's not the sort of producer that goes after Oscar glory or critical acclaim, his only interest in life is box office receipts. Normally, he is actually quite good at finding hit films, but not today Josephine. I'm glad Pearl Harbor was a massive flop, it just goes to show that it takes more than money to make a financially successful film. Maybe he should watch Lord of the Rings a couple of times to find out why. Don't rent this movie at the video store, it's very boring to say the least. Nothing happen in the first hour of the movie, and when it does you couldn't careless about it. What's more, Cuba Gooding Jnr was wasted on this film, the producers didn't even think to give him a bigger role. Not my best review, but if the moviemakers didn't bother, why should I.",Null,0,1,30 March 2002
