United 93," One of the most moving films I have ever seen!
","After walking out of the film (excuse me), I walked into the men's bathroom, and there were two men standing against the wall crying. As one of the men looked up at me, tears streaming down his face, I knew what he was going through, and he just shook his head saying, 'Wheeew, man that was rough.' Never have I seen a film affect people to this degree. Other than seeing 'The Passion of Christ,' I never saw an audience leave in complete silence. Usually someone speaks, but you could have heard a pin drop.Paul Greengrass, the director, shows you something true (or as close to true as facts allow). Most films that are fiction and have great stories move us emotionally, but those films that are true and have something we remember involving a devastating event effect us to the core. I think most of us can remember where we were when we first heard the news of 09/11/2001. My mom remembers running down the street at 24 years old telling everyone that Kennedy had been shot. I remember watching the space shuttle explode in the 80's (skipped out of school that dayÂ…ha ha), but nothing compared to watching the live television coverage of the World Trade Center disaster.Greengrass, being English, doesn't just concentrate on the plight of the passengers, but allows the audience to see it from the terrorist's eyes as well.Spoiler: There is a scene where the primary terrorist is sitting next to a prominent executive in a designer suit and leather shoes. You see him continuing to stare at the shoes as if to be thinking my compatriots and people are dying and starving and this greedy American continues to consume products at will without regard to survival.As you watch this film, keep in mind that the film is just as long as the actual flight of United 93. Given the circumstances, what would you do? What amount of terror would you be feeling? The passengers had only a short time to react to all the things that were happening, yet they found the time to call their loved ones and tell them bye. Greengrass' film is emotionally draining and powerful. Greengrass takes you on the ride with the passengers and doesn't let you go. I did find myself having an urge to leave the theater because I wanted to get off the plane. Then I reminded myself, 'They couldn't get off, so I won't leave them.' This film will be the one remembered in years to come as the pivotal film about 09/11.",10,2,6,9 May 2006
Paranormal Activity," Does the movie live up to the hype? HELL YES!!
","Do yourself a favor. Before seeing this film, go to the theater without knowing anything. Don't read anything or look at spoilers. Just let it be u, the movie, and the dark. Mooooo ha ha!! Ohh sorry! I saw this movie last night with a friend of mine, and to say that it freaked me out is an understatement.The one lesson that I have learned from watching suspenseful films is our imaginations are more scary to us than being fed scary scenes from a film and told what to think. I will not presume to talk about any scene n this film for it would 'spoil' the experience.Hitchcock said that suspense is a bomb under a table that never explodes. Well n this film there is a bomb that doesn't explode, then does explode, and then does a dance. It is a film that will keep u on the edge of ur seat the entire time. It is rare that u see a film that lives up to the hype,but this $15,000 film delivers and delivers big!! I know that most of what I have said has sounded generic; however, I don't want to say too much because more information other than the trailer could ruin the experience. I will leave this last thought. Something happened at the end of the film that has never happened to me before. When the movie ended, no one moved. People were stuck n their seats and no one was leaving. To me, it seemed as though they were frozen with fear for an entire minute. When a film has that much power, u need to do yourself a favor and see it.",8,1,5,17 October 2009
From Hell," This movie is the definition of the Hughes brother's style!
","After watching this movie for the first time, I thought it was really good, but throughout that next week, images and the look of the film stayed with me. The Hughes Brother's depiction of 19th century England is as I have always imagined; the peasantry and the upper class being so separated, the look of the buildings, people, cobblestone roads, fog, and lastly the Legend of Jack the Ripper. Also, keep an eye out for the Hughes brother's use of the camera.This is my favorite Johnny Depp role; he is an addict, genius, poet, and is constantly haunted by the visions he receives. Johnny Depp has amazing versatility as an actor. His English accent was very surprising.I hope any history buff or person that is interested in the Jack the Ripper case watches this film. It is truly wonderful to see.",9,2,3,20 January 2006
300," '300' is the Definition of Testosterone!!!
","Over a year ago, I saw the clip for '300' and showed the actors working out and getting in shape for their roles. I was so pumped about this film (being a history minor and all). It really delivered wonderful fighting scenes and the only thing that was wanting was the script. It was a little weak at times, but still had some good lines. The best part of the film is the transition from normal speed fighting to slow motion. It makes the film. Everyone should know that this is a hugely violent film. It is likely the most violent I have ever seen.This is a testosterone filled movie. The first half hour is describing how the Spartans came to be and then the last 3/4's of the film is nothing but pure fighting with small breaks in between. Don't be surprised if you walk out of the movie sweating!!!! Exciting and Fun!!",8,3,7,24 March 2007
