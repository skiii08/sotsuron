","When a movie is able to surpass its predecessor in all the right ways, it's bound to be a timeless classic in years to come. Blade Runner 2049 is stunning and very powerful.

Interstellar," Well done Mr. Nolan
","After 1.2M+ IMDb reviews... here's my review of interstellar. I've seen this movie more than 12 times. I first saw it in grade 7 on a small TV and No other film I've ever seen has had this much of an impact on me as a movie critic and filmmaker. This movie is visually stunning, emotionally-charged, and powerful. I love it more & more every time I see it and it, and it is a masterpiece of our time. If visual storytelling, screenwriting, or music composition is your thing... this is the movie for you! Hans Zimmer has created an emotionally resonant score to hit you in the feels unlike any other film. Christopher Nolan directed the heck out of this movie and did a phenomenal job. The performances are outstanding, life-like, and painfully realistic. This film HAS inspired and WILL inspire filmmakers for decades to come. I understand that many people don't like this movie because it was boring and/or WAY too long, but movies can be for many purposes... you can go to the movies for explosive and mindless fun or you can go to the movies for an emotionally realistic escape into the future with philosophical themes about human connections, love, and perseverance. Interstellar is a masterpiece needing the recognition it deserves.",10,1,3,3 October 2018
