Walk the Line," What's the value?
","That was an unusual feeling after watching this movie. I thought I would worry about Johnny's wife and family but I didn't. Did I feel sorry for Johnny? I can't say so.
It was unusual for me because all the time I watch movies I find a character to sympathize to. But not this time. What's the reason? I tried to find it out. This movie is more than just about a person or some event. For me this movie is about values. In this movie I saw how people can choose different values than they had before.
It made me think about the time of value. Before it I thought if a person has some strong values he/she will follow them whatever happens. Not everything is so simple.",10,1,1,11 March 2018
