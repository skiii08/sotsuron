The Avengers," Avengers Assemble!
","This is the first MCU movie I ever saw and this one got me invested. It was a little longer than I expected but it was really entertaining! There were a lot of elements taken from the other movies that help string all the movies together. I did have a few issues, this was longer than it needed to be and the first half was a bit too information-dense. The second half, though, more than made up for it. The action sequence and the visual effects were amazing. All the characters were assets to this film. The humor, the bonds between the characters make the movie special. This was deeply enjoyable!",9,0,1,5 January 2019
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," A Little Boring
","I had high expectations from this one but this quickly fizzled out. Honestly, the last Hunger Games book did not need two separate movies, so this one didn't really have a lot of progression. There wasn't much character development and not a lot happened really. It seemed like filler material and was incredibly slow. The actors were okay in their respective roles but I really thought it would be better since I had enjoyed the other movies in this series. I will continue on to the last film of the series to get some closure, but this was a one-time watch for me.",7,1,1,2 April 2020
A Star Is Born," Deeply Emotional and Personal
","I have been avoiding this movie since I thought this would be too sappy. Well, after watching the movie, I have to say, I was not quite accurate in my thought. I have to mention, I knew the story and I had watched remakes of the original story, so I was well aware of what was to come. What this movie did, though, was make it so deeply personal that I couldn't help but root for the characters to have a happy ending.Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga exhibit scintillating chemistry and they really looked like they were completely invested in the story. I enjoyed the concert scenes, but the conversation scenes where they get to know each other were what really drew me in. Bradley Cooper has done a wonderful job in his debut directorial venture, and he sure exhibits a natural flair for storytelling. I am eager to see more from him in the Director's chair.The best thing about the movie was the cast. The lead characters were great, but the supporting characters were no less. Billy Elliot was so good in his role as Cooper's brother in the film. The songs were emotional and beautiful, and both the leads did a great job on their vocal performances. I was surprised by Cooper; Gaga, as usual, does a great job. There's a real pathos in her voice which draws out emotions from the audience as well.The other elements, including the cinematography, sound design, and editing were all very well done, and works to further benefit the movie. This was a great adaptation of the well-known and well-loved tale.",8,0,0,21 March 2020
Iron Man 2," A Good Sequel to the First Film
","Considering how much I liked the first film, I was expecting to like this one just as much. However, this was a tad disappointing. I loved the new additions to the story like Nick Fury and Natasha Romanoff, who both had pivotal roles to play in the movie, although they could have been given more screen-time. Sam Rockwell was good in his role as antagonist to Tony Stark, and Mickey Rourke played the creepy villain in this film. I loved Robert Downey Jr., and he shares amazing chemistry with Gwyneth Paltrow in this one. One issue I had with the film was that too many things were happening. The structure of the screenplay could have been kept simple. Could have been better but I enjoyed it nevertheless. A good enough sequel.",8,0,1,5 January 2019
12 Angry Men," A perfect piece of work
","This movie has been on my radar for a very long time, consistently placing in all the Best Movies of All Time lists I've come across. Now I can testify to the fact that this movie is nothing short of cinematic brilliance! Every single moment in the movie, from the minute expressions to the big proclamations, had me marveling. The actors have performed with such sheer honesty that I couldn't take my eyes away.Most of the run time, I was gushing over the cast, their little jokes and long speeches, but it would be a crime for me to not mention the direction and the cinematography. The movie was shot so intimately, creating an almost unsettling feeling in the viewer. I could feel a persistent adrenaline rush throughout the run time. Every time there was a vote call, my heart would beat a little faster while awaiting the verdict. This is the very first time that I have watched a movie with any of these cast members and I realized what I had missed out on. From the moment the jurors enter the jury room to the moment after the verdict when they go back to their respective stations in life, these fine actors made me feel a connect to the characters and to the story, leaving me completely engrossed. That is possibly the biggest victory of a movie made in the past: Standing the test of time. And boy, did this movie exceed all my expectations.As I read the trivia after I finished watching the movie, I realized that at the current moment of my viewing, in 2018, all of the jurors have passed on. But to have been a part in making a timeless legacy like this one, maybe that's what it means, to have lived a fulfilling life.A timeless classic like no other I've watched so far. Will definitely watch again.",10,0,1,12 February 2018
Just Go with It," One-time (somewhat funny) Watch
","I watched this movie for the lead actors. Suffice it to say, I was a little disappointed in the end because the movie wasn't as good as I expected it to be. It was slapstick comedy at best, with a lot of the jokes being too crude for my taste. The overall plot though was a comedy of errors and was reasonably funny, although at times, it went a little overboard. It also seemed like Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston were trying too hard. Having already proved their natural flair for comedy, and great comic timing, it seemed like the lead actors were putting in a lot of effort to come off as funny. That was a tad upsetting. I did like Sandler and Aniston's chemistry though. The supporting cast was also decent. The light nature of the movie and the humorous undertones were good enough to warrant a watch, but I probably wouldn't watch it again.",7,0,0,18 December 2018
Aquaman," Better Than Expected!
","This was definitely an improvement on the DCEU movies. I enjoyed it much more than the recent movies based in this universe. First, the pros- the visual effects are aesthetic and absolutely stunning. The action scenes are also great, and the amount of CGI work on this actually shows. It looks really good. Jason Momoa is also a big asset in this film, because, to be honest, he makes Aquaman cool. Aquaman hasn't been one of the most-liked superheroes in popular media, and many have previously made fun of the character. But, Momoa here really flips the script. The way he carries himself in the film has really changed the way I look at Aquaman, and I'm sure he has done the same for others too.The supporting cast were good, and I liked Nicole Kidman's portrayal as Queen Atlanna. Patrick Wilson was also good in his role as the antagonist.Moving on to the cons, I thought the script was a little weak. It seemed like a rehashed plot and was very similar to other superhero origin stories and a little cliched too. I especially thought the movie was awkward at times. Without going into spoiler area, I thought some moments didn't make much sense. Black Manta also was not so well-used here. I wish we could have seen a little more of him. I am expecting better for the sequel as this movie really makes me want to get into the DCEU. This was fairly good; one extra star for the CGI effects, which were very well done.",8,0,7,16 March 2020
Megamind," Smart, funny and really engrossing
","This was my second watch and I've enjoyed this film both times. Megamind is the villain of the movie, who just wants to be bad. His origin story showed how fate didn't deal him the best cards but he tried to work with what he had. His nemesis, Metro Man, is the good guy. Everyone loves him and every time Megamind and Metro Man square off, the latter wins. But Megamind doesn't give up and keeps trying to be the best villain of all time. He keeps kidnapping Roxanne Ritchie, a journalist and keeps challenging Metro Man. Later in the story, Megamind feels the void that the absence of a hero has left in him, and he decides to create another hero to challenge.The movie was funny and the writing was well thought-out. I don't watch a lot of animated movies and even I enjoyed it thoroughly. Will Ferrell is fantastic as always and Tina Fey does a great job again. I'll probably watch this again some time.",8,0,0,6 August 2018
Suicide Squad," Disappointing
","Considering all the hype this has gotten, I was expecting a cracker of a movie, but this fizzled out. The movie just seemed pointless. The story was not well-structured enough and it seemed like the main conflict in the story was brought on by the good guys themselves. I liked the special effects and the background music, but there isn't a lot to write home about. With characters like El Diablo, Harley Quinn and Deadshot, a lot could have been done but this movie just did not work out for me.As an independent movie, without the DC supervillains, I would have rated this higher, because it was somewhat entertaining. But the supervillains just seemed like a waste in this film. Some really bad casting choices- Cara Delevingne was atrocious and I was cringing every time she came on screen. However, Margot Robbie was good as Harley Quinn.This was a waste of time. Left a lot to be desired.",5,0,0,7 August 2018
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Hard-to-Watch and so Twisted
","This was quite the 'comedy', oh boy. The title pretty much tells you about a pretty important piece in the story- the three billboards. The story was very nicely built up, and the acting by the main leads was absolutely amazing. They brought their characters to life. One can feel the pain in Frances McDormand's every move, the rage and confusion behind Sam Rockwell's actions, and the struggle in Woody Harrelson's eyes. Great casting!There were times when the movie became almost too difficult to watch, as it dealt with a lot of different matters- rape, murder, domestic violence, police brutality, homophobia, and racism. But each topic was dealt with it in a sensitive way, and it didn't feel like a confusing mixture of social issues.I cannot speak enough about the direction and the screenplay. It was a very mature portrayal of problems that plague the society, and one woman's struggle to get justice for her daughter. This was really a great movie. Even on the second watch, this doesn't feel at all stale.",9,0,0,16 March 2020
Justice League," Expected More
","After watching the trailer, I was expecting something absolutely mind-boggling, so this was a bit of a disappointment. The entire movie felt like an introductory session into the characters of the Justice League. Steppanwolf wasn't a very formidable villain either. DC still has a long way to go and considering the big players in the DC comics world, I have hope that they will get there soon.This movie made promises it couldn't keep, even though stylistically, this was still entertaining. My favorite character was Barry Allen (The Flash). Ezra Miller was really good as Allen and added the comic element in the film. His expressions were perfect and made me laugh throughout. Probably one of the only good things about this film. I also enjoyed the battle sequences and the special effects.Seemed like it had a lot of potential but fell short in execution. Would have liked to see the story move further. Hopefully the upcoming movies would be better.",7,4,5,25 August 2018
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," A Fun Watch!
","I procrastinated on this movie for quite a while, not knowing what to expect. I was scared that it might not be as good as the Harry Potter franchise. I'm so glad a friend asked me to watch this because this movie, although not as dark as the Harry Potter movies, was as enjoyable. The movie was an adventure. The special effects were amazing and I loved the Fantastic Beasts used in the film. The Niffler, the Demiguise, and the Bowtruckle were all adorable and so endearing! Eddie Redmayne was amazing as Newt Scamander and it felt like he was meant to play that role. Newt Scamander is an unconventional film hero. He's not big and muscled like the Marvel superheroes, nor is he an agile, street-smart hero. Instead, he is the sensitive and sweet type of person who your heart just goes out to. His bond with his animals, and also with his new friend Jacob was heart-warming. I loved how believable Redmayne was while playing the character. The supporting cast was great too and Dan Fogler was great as Jacob Kowalski, the clueless No-Maj who is forced into an epic adventure. The entire cast of characters brought something to the table and made the movie what it was: An absolute delight to watch!",8,1,2,6 January 2019
Guardians of the Galaxy," Entertaining and Fun!
","I was a little skeptical about this movie since I haven't really enjoyed sci-fi based films in the past, but this one surprised me quite a bit! The cast is amazing and Chris Pratt is fantastic as Peter Quill. Also, Groot and Rocket Raccoon were so good in this film, I went back to watch their scenes over and over again. The action sequences were great and the visual effects were quite outstanding. The best thing about the movie is the use of humor in the script and how organic it felt. It didn't feel forced at all. The mid-credit scene was amazing and there is a dance-off in the movie that made me laugh quite hard. Overall, a very entertaining cinematic experience!",8,0,1,6 May 2019
Elysium," Reasonably Entertaining, Lacks in Character Development
","While I did think Elysium was entertaining enough, I did not understand why the movie had to be so shallow. You don't really get to know any of the characters, and you don't end up rooting much for them either. A longer run-time could have been much more satisfying.The cinematography is excellent and I loved how visually appealing it was. But, the science fiction aspect of it was severely lacking. The screenplay really needed to include the 'Why?' behind Elysium to develop a deeper connect with the audience. A lot of unanswered questions remain.With regard to the casting and direction, it was fairly good. Damon, Foster, and Copley are good in their respective roles and the supporting cast also do justice to their roles. Overall, this was okay, but it could have been great.",6,0,0,5 May 2020
Thor," Behold, the God of Thunder is Here!
","Thor is, quite possibly, one of my favorite characters in the MCU and Chris Hemsworth does really well in his role as the arrogant-but-lovable god of Thunder. The cast is really good, complete with premiere acting talent- topped by Anthony Hopkins as Odin. I loved the special effects, the fight scenes, and the humor, but undoubtedly, the best thing about the movie is the portrayal of the relationships between the characters. The Father-Son relationship, the one between the brothers, even Thor and Jane's bond- it was all structured in a beautiful manner. The movie relied a lot on the special effects but the core conflict between Thor and Loki was what made the movie heart-warming and entertaining at the same time. A great addition to the MCU!",8,0,0,5 January 2019
Iron Man," Best Casting Ever!
","Robert Downey Jr. was made for the role of Tony Stark/Iron Man. He is absolutely perfect as the lovable jerk too big for his shoulders. Every minute of this movie was a testament to the fact that RDJ was probably the only person who could pull it off. Whoever made the casting decision deserves an award.Talking about the movie, this one was thoroughly entertaining and backed with the performance by RDJ and the supporting cast- this sets the tone for the entire MCU universe. The special effects were great and the suits looked pretty good. The best thing about this movie is the surprising humor moments between Tony and the other characters (including his robots). The story was structured pretty well. This movie sealed Iron Man as one of my favorite superheroes ever! This was a lot of fun!",9,0,0,5 January 2019
