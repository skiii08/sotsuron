Hereditary," Wuh?
","This movie is far from boring, as some reviewers have concluded; solid acting, eerie cinematography, and almost a decent script makes this an overall decent movie... UNTIL ABOUT THE FINAL 20 minutes. I would have rated this higher than a 5 (quite possibly a 7) but the film's conclusion felt totally out of place.If they had just cut out the last few scenes of nonsense & had the mother sacrifice herself for her family (what's left of it!), I'd imagine there'd be fewer reviews asking for 2 hours of their life back.",6,0,1,27 August 2018
