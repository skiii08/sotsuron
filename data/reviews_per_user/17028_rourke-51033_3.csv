Sucker Punch," Interesting
",I liked this movie quite a lot but it makes me irritated that you want to love it but can't. The story underneath the psychedelic drug trip is very interesting and it 's a bit of a Life of PI situation. The movie is basically ruined by the best thing in it. Which 's strange. The action is amazing but that is what takes you out of the story that is actually going on. When babydoll dances in the film she shows us what they are doing but in a different way and as a result we end up with these metaphor clogged video game missions that take you out of what Is actually a very good story about freedom. They are cool to watch but they sort of feel out of place in a movie about a brothel or a mental institute depending on how you look at it. But definitely worth a watch.,6,0,2,11 April 2016
Captain America: Civil War," Great movie
","Captain America civil war is a great action scenes and a thrilling story. Its problems , however, involve multiple underdeveloped characters (scarlet witch, vision, black panther and Spiderman...also crossbones and baron zemo) scarlet witch is developed in this film and we see her struggling with her powers so she gets ticked off the list in this film. Vision isn't really developed much and the only development his character receives is in his relationships. Black panther, as a new character he hasn't been developed, was devolved slightly and we see his passion for what he believes in play out. Spider-Man is amazingly developed and the new Peter Parker is best one so far. Crossbones and baron demo are so horribly boring that they are probably the worst marvel villains so far (which is saying something). The plot was really intense and the action scenes were amazing so the good > bad.",8,21,45,2 May 2016
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Great film...even better if you are a DC fan
","This film was a great movie but it had a few problems. The pros do ,however, outweigh the cons. Story- personally for me, I really enjoyed the story because you had to fit it together yourself and wasn't really obvious. This movie did require you to think and although the core storyline was there you had to fit things you heard earlier in order for any of the motivations to make sense. Action- The movie has action throughout the movie and has nice story driven moments in between. I would say that about 40% of the film was action. When action did occur, it was absolutely amazing and what else would you expect from Zack Snyder. Notable fights include: batman's nightmare, batmobile Chase, batman v superman fight, doomsday fight finale. Wonder woman- I loved wonder women in this movie as she delivers all her lines with terrorising accent that makes you feel as though she is Amazonian. Her fight scene at the end with doomsday was amazing. She uses her sword, gauntlets, shield and lasso in the fight and it flows together nicely. Batman- one of the best characters in the movie. Hellbent on taking down superman. He is actually extremely creepy as batman and is almost James bond-esque in his Bruce Wayne scenes. Finally we see batman using detective skills and all of his gadgets. Batman is simply brilliant and wonder woman and him make this movie deserve at least 5 stars. Lex luthor- this character is extremely interesting because he is not the lex we know and yet he is at the same time. He is quirky, weird, awkward and also extremely terrifying. The moment he enters a room, it just makes things tense. Edditing- the first twenty minutes is very jumpy but after lex's party it all comes into focus.This would be my only problem with the film. Doomsday- although he looked crap in the trailer, he looks a lot better in the film. He also has an amazing fight with the trinity. One of the best parts of the movie. The military activation was all there. Batman v Superman- although the fight happened a lot later than expected it fit perfectly with the story and as you watch superman try to convince batman that lex has played them both you really feel bad for superman. This fight was good and straight out of the graphic novel. There was also some interesting stuff involving their parents in the fight. Over all verdict - statement - my favourite comic book film since iron man 1.",9,4,8,26 March 2016
