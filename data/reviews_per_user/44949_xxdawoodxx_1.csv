Walk the Line," Excellent Stuff!
","The movie is simply great. Down to earth it is and the acting is really great. Pheonix (Cash) has done a great job and of course and as usual Reese Witherspoon has done a great job as well. The way Pheonix portrays the character of a broken/confused/upset man... I'd say he has done a brilliant job. The way he asked his dad, 'Where were you?'... OMG it actually made me cry. Reese on the other hand portrayed a serene and patient person. Not to mention that she took care of Cash (Pheonix) for sometime which I found a really touching part of the movie.Not to forget to mention the fact that this movie has no nude scenes in it. It was rather a REAL romantic movie with only dialogues on the romantic part. Although a slow movie but that does not bother me in saying that it is one of the best movies I have ever seen! The movie just has you thinking about it the whole day and you want to watch it over and over again. A great movie I'd say and definitely more that worth watching!",10,1,3,8 April 2006
