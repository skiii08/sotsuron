Hereditary," What a waste ...
","This movie was a complete mess.It's one saving grace: it can be used as a case study on how NOT to make a horror film. Although the first 20 minutes proved to be credible, by the middle of the movie I had lost all interest in the plot. Not to mention the last 20-minute section of the movie -- which was so absurd and preposterous that I was tempted to leave the theater altogether. An insult to intelligent movie goers, the quality of this movie is so poor that it makes it almost unbearable to watch in its entirety.",2,36,74,17 June 2018
The Hateful Eight," Opportunity Squandered
","Great director. Excellent ensemble cast. Such a unique plot! Not to mention the 70 mm Panavision experience (in selected theaters).With all this going for it, 'The Hateful Eight' had all the elements to become one of those movies that excels in so many areas. On paper, by design, this movie had it all. Unfortunately, everything the movie had going for it was squandered by the gratuitous violence embedded across multiple scenes. Many of the scenes in the movie could have benefited from a 'less is more' approach which would have enhanced the suspense and made this the classic thriller-western it deserved to be.",6,0,1,9 May 2017
