United 93," Powerful
","This movie made me angrier than any other movie I can recall. The passengers on board United 93 were heroes to say the least. Knowing they were likely going to die, they chose to sacrifice themselves, in the words of the Air Force PJs, 'so others may live.' This movie perfectly embodies the American spirit. We will fight tooth and nail against evil, no matter the cost.",8,0,0,21 August 2018
It," Like saying you want to recreate the Mona Lisa and drawing a stick man
","The acting is fantastic. The cinematography is phenomenal. The story has strayed so far from the book that it's almost unrecognizable. IT is my favorite piece of fiction ever written. Part of what makes IT so good is the (very) slow build up throughout the book: the revelation of the history of Derry, the terrifying encounters with Pennywise, the simultaneous telling of their stories as kids and adults, finding out the true nature of Pennywise, and how they decide to fight IT. The movie accomplishes none of these. It is a collection of well shot scenes and that's it.",5,0,0,22 September 2019
Dawn of the Dead," Entertaining, but could be a lot better
","The characters really take away from this movie. Their level of idiocy really detracts from what is an enjoyable, albeit frustrating movie.",7,0,0,13 June 2018
Face_Off," Interesting Idea, Mediocore Implementation
","The idea for the movie was interesting. They could've done a lot with it. I found the writing to be somewhat nonbelievable. The best movies are the ones where you forget about the actor and all you see is the character. This is why Heath Ledger was amazing as the Joker. This movie does not accomplish that. All I saw was John Travolta and Nick Cage acting; I was never engrossed in the actual characters. The action scenes are so over the top as well that I couldn't buy into it. Cheap entertainment, I watched it because it was on Netflix. It's worth watching if you can't find anything else, but don't expect to be blown away. The whole movie is fairly predictable.",6,0,1,25 August 2018
The Dark Knight," The Perfect Villain
",The Joker doesn't use chaos as a means to an end; it is the end. Anarchy in its purest form. How do you beat a villain who has no agenda? Heath Ledger plays the greatest bad guy in cinema history and to this day remains my favorite role from any movie.,10,1,1,15 October 2019
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," The Trilogy that Never Should Have Happened
","The movie looks good visually and is well acted. That is the extent of its saving grace. This movie is almost entirely a remake of A New Hope. Instead of the Rebels vs the Empire, you have the Resistance vs the First Order. Instead of the Death Star, you have Starkiller. The names aren't even original. You have the newbie to the force standing up to the seasoned villain. The only difference is that Rey is exceptionally good at the force and fighting with a lightsaber right off the bat. What? It took Luke, the greatest Jedi of all time, 3 movies to develop the amount of skill she has. This is explained, albeit poorly, in Rise of Skywalker. Her first use of the force is a freaking Jedi mind trick? Talk about ridiculous.A new trilogy could have taken two possible directions. It could haven followed shortly after Return of the Jedi with new actors, or gone to a different time/place in the galaxy with entirely new characters. Instead they tried to walk some weird middle road where they brought back everyone's favorite characters and made them all freaking losers. Han Solo is killed off in the most ridiculous possible way. He survives attacking two different Death Stars just to get shanked by his whiny emo kid? Wow.Disney really screwed up here, these movies never should have happened. I actually liked Rise of Skywalker because it attempted to fix all of the mistakes in 7 and 8.",5,3,5,4 February 2020
