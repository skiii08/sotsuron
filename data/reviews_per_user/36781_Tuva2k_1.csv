Requiem for a Dream," Strange rules by people to people
","Rated R for intense depiction of drug addiction, graphic sexuality, strong language and some violence?!?! This is the kind of movie that should not be rated R. Why? Did you feel like taking some drugs after the movie? I think this is a good movie that really makes people think about drugs and how dangerous it is. The decay of these characters really makes you think.",10,0,1,25 March 2002
