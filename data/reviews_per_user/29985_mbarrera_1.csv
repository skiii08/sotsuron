Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A sad, big disappointment...
","After so many years waiting, I was greatly disappointed with this movie. Mr. Lucas had all the elements there, but the final blend went just wrong. It *could* have been such a great prequel...Yet, I will be willing to see Episode II. Maybe the force will be with us then.",Null,0,1,10 July 1999
