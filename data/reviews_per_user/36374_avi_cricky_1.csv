Changeling," Somethings never change...!
","This is not a review from me...but instead just a feeling that made me write my first comment in IMDb. First thing I want to say is 'movie is incredibly amazing and trilling'. I should also mention suspense because it is actually an unexpected driving story that made me watch rest of the movie.In case of performance, I think everyone did a fair job. But, Angelina's one was quite surprising though as most people like me just seen her as a star not as an performer. In that terms, I think she did more than fair job to her role.I will give 8 because movie beginning made me not to give full even though movie picked up immensely after that. Overall a worth while effort from everyone including director, Eastwood. I wish them all the best and make all profits from this good movie.Avi",8,1,3,19 March 2009
