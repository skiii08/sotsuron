The Hangover," More than expected
","I just returned from the theater where I saw 'The Hangover', and I must admit, with what I saw from it first, I wouldn't have chosen it myself, but a very foxy lady (Italian, redhead, and a nice rack) asked me if I wanted to see that one, and any guy will know that if a girl like that asks you out, SHE chooses the movie. Awaiting her arrival, I met my cousin up front, and he told me he thought'The Hangover' was that chick flick. After just watching the film for 2 minutes, Bradley Cooper appeared on the screen and my date said 'Oh God, he's so hot, that's the reason why I wanted to see the film'. At this point, I didn't really think this movie was going to be something, but soon I had to review my opinion.The humour in this movie for starters is of different levels. There is the sexual innuendo/teen-humour, there are crazy and absurd situations, there is some slapstick, basically, whatever humour you favour, this movie has got it. You'll laugh at some point in the film.The beginning of the movie gives you a great feeling. It really somehow has that vibe of 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas', where you also had the feeling that you wanted to experience the same fun the actors in that movie had. You just feel like you're on a 'magical ride' with them, and you regret not being there in real life.The characters in this movie are really worked out nicely, both by the screenplay as well as the actors. Hot shot of the evening, Bradley Cooper, really gave me the impression like he was an incredible fun person to be around with, and I'd definitely want Phil (his character in the movie) to be my friend in real life. Zach Galifianakis (Alan) plays a great annoying little moron too. In the beginning of the movie you hate him, and you'd wish they dump him in the desert, but he manages to win you over by his at least good nature.A nice addition to the movie is Ken Jeong who plays a (probably) gay leader of the Chinese mafia who seems obsessed by imitating Western (African-American) slang and manners. Normally I'm not too fond of Asian actors, but this one really give the movie extra humour.Don't let a weak trailer keep you from seeing this movie. I've enjoyed it immensely, and had quite a few laughs, while I'm usually not the kind to break out in laughter.",9,8,14,25 July 2009
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Prince of Parkour
","Just returned from the theatre where I watched the PoP-movie. I must start of by saying I am biased when reviewing this movie, but the PoP-trilogy is the only game I ever finished (apart from God of War I and FFX). All others made me lose interest after a few levels, so I absolutely love this series.But apart from my gaming history, I really liked the movie. Does it contain a lot of depth? Does it contain the best worked out characters, Not really, so why a nine? Because that is not what one should expect from such a movie, which more drives on atmosphere, scenery and action.In the beginning the movie starts a fun adventure, with drunk and dashing Dastan even reminding me a bit of Jack Sparrow. He loses this edge though later in the movie, when he turns into a more serious character out to save the world. The ostrich races also attribute to the light hearted atmosphere in the beginning of the movie since running ostriches are just plain cool and funny animals.However, around 30 minutes in the movie, the real story begins with the time traveling dagger. These time travel effects are quite impressive, and I momentarily can't think how else you could have portrayed them in this movie. However, there are only four or five time transportations, which is kind of a shame since I expected more.Another special effect are the parkour moves from the Prince of course. These are present throughout the entire movie, and even though sometimes it is a bit hard to follow what is happening, they stayed close to the game when it comes to the prince's moves.The plot is quite predictable after around 45 minutes, but that doesn't bother me in these kinds of movies. These movies aren't really made for plot twists anyway. The only thing I didn't get is that they predicted the world would end if they released all the sands, but instead, the Prince is returned to before everything started, instead of the world ending. I didn't pay all attention at this point, so maybe it's clear if I rewatch the movie.Last of all, I want to say something about Jake Gyllenhaal and Ben Kingsley. Ben puts a great performance here once again, from minute one he radiates something evil, although that could also have to do with the fact this is how evil Persians are portrayed now (bald men with eyeliner). I never really noticed Jake Gyllenhaal, but after this movie I have become a fan, especially in the first 30 minutes where he's playing the fun loving Dastan.I didn't think this was a bad movie, but one should enter the theatre with the right mindset, sitting back for some mindless special effects action.",9,11,25,23 May 2010
Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs," Three's a crowd...
","Ice Age III was the long awaited sequel to the second Ice Age-movie. Long awaited at least by one of my dearest friends, who just gets a kick out of these kind of CG-animated movies. Due to time limits, we didn't get to see the movie until a few days ago, and I must say it kinda disappointed me. I was unable to laugh the entire movie, the characters had all their best jokes in the first two movies I think, and they leave little entertainment value to me. Now, it is probably my problem, since these movies are not for me. However, my friend also told me, she had only smiled a few times during the movie, and usually she's belly laughing throughout these cartoons. Another thing we both agree on was that there was that Scrat appeared too often in this movie. He was best in the first movie where he got a little scene in the opening and ending of the movie, but in this movie, he appears in short scenes throughout the movie, and this is overkill in our opinion.The plot in these movies is also painfully obvious after you've seen the first 15 minutes, at least to the adult eye.My personal experience was not that positive but this does not mean it is a bad movie at all. I can appreciate the stunning graphics this movie offers, along with the nice voice acting, especially by Sid and Buck. Buck is also a new character that will be a favourite to many, but for me he did not work. This tough 'jungle pirate' that believes fear is just a four letter word, has grown completely paranoia and has multiple personalities, much to the delight of other people in the theater.The humour in this movie is described as being for kids and adults, but quite frankly, I don't think too many adults will enjoy this movie for the humour, most parents will be dragged to this movie by their children and have a nice time, but nothing more. However, this is an ideal movie to take your kids too, and give them a delightful afternoon for a relatively cheap buck in these times of economical crisis.It was not for me, they could have quit after the second movie, but still 8/10",8,1,3,25 July 2009
