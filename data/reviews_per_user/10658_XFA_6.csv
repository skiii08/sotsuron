The Ring," 'She will NEVER stop'
","I've never seen the ORIGINAL of this film. I never even knew it was a REMAKE. People I know that have seen this rendition of this film kept telling me how good and quite scary this is.... So , I rented it and was very enthralled in it. I wanted to know what all the fuss was about. I'll say it is fairly good , decently interesting and much different than anything I have ever seen. The only thing that I did not care for in this was the ending , I was quite disappointed in that. But this has some spooky parts and for that - and the story itself , I liked this. I mean , just think of this film as a realistic happening - in that aspect - this is quite scary... But you know - there is a lot more SCIFI here than spook.I like HORROR better than SCIFI - but I still enjoyed this. Pretty kool.... :) PEACE",Null,1,2,22 October 2004
54," The Party Doesnt End Til Sunrise
","I love this movie. Mike Myers was excellent in the role as club owner Steve Rubell. Although he was not the only club owner at that time , but noone ever even sees that guy in this film. Mark Christopher does an excellent , almost flawless job in depicting the party that was Studio 54. Like with all bio/movies , some pieces are not true - but Mark seemed to put as much truth as he could fit into this one - as was the same for his other 1998 film , bio/movie of supermodel Gia.One thing that was a little sketchy about this film is that when the viewer sees all the 'guests' that were granted entrance or had been on the 'guestlists' to enter the club , one may have a hard time knowing who is depicting who. In other words , as far as the real Studio 54 club goes , 'guests' were people in power , of money , in the art world , in the business (actors , actresses , supermodels , music artists) - and this makes it hard to tell which star in the movie is depicting which star....Get my drift? Who is playing who in this movie???? Are we as viewers supposed to get just the 'feel' of the club , or are we to know who these people are supposed to be???? Other than that - I JUST LOVE IT!",Null,1,2,1 September 2003
The Exorcist," Eek!!!Scariest Stuff I'VE Ever Seen!!!
","OK - I ADORE this film...The original 1973 release has always fascinated me(I was born that year)I will credit this movie - alone - for making me such a die-hard horror fanatic. I could never watch this movie alone.I've also heard many many stories of the effect it had in it's original release at the theaters , on its viewers.Incredible masterpiece.... Horrible , psychological stuff scares the pants off me. Then , this movie was remastered with some new things and ....Oh bless their hearts - put back into the theaters for a Halloween release , which I HAD to go and see. I still loved it. I thought the extra parts of the film were decent and interesting. This movie is SO scary - this is the scariest movie I have ever seen in my life! What I just found out last month when i seen the real story behind this film - that really amazed me - was the fact that , - that really creepy voice poor little Regan has when she is possessed is actually , a voice of a woman!!! WHOA! Not that what happens in the film and the idea of the film are not scary enough , but what always got me - was that creepy voice. Best horror film EVER. Nothing can ever be this scary again. Halloween viewing at its evilist. PEACE",Null,0,1,17 September 2004
28 Days Later...," 'And you're going to be next...'
","last week , i visited a good friend of mine - he had told me he bought this film on DVD - told me about the story(saying that he wasn't SO impressed with this , because what the heck IS RAGE???...it is an emotion not a virus!!) - But he told me to take it home and check it out for myself. So , last night I decided 'Hey , what do I have to lose?...Time to watch this film finally.' OK firstly , this DVD has TONS of extra stuff - thats pretty kool. I'm sitting here - thinking - 'ok , show me what you've got.' LOL , To be completely honest , this film had my undivided attention after the first half hour. I'm going to say I seen this wholly as a SCIFI film , in the event that , like I've already quoted my friend as saying , 'RAGE is an emotion , not a virus'....But in this film , RAGE becomes a virus and it turns into an epidemic as far as it can take itself. So , the storyline here is way unique. I think this movie is excellent. Well thought out , well made - not scary but the idea here is a bit scary.... I almost bought this on DVD myself , but when reading the back of it - i noticed there is no storyline to get your attention....It just states that this is one of the scariest films since THE EXORCIST. This is no where as scary as THE EXORCIST , for realistic reasons. THE EXORCIST is HORROR. This is SCIFI. That's the difference. OMGosh!!! Great stuff here.... If you are into SCIFI or a kool twist in your horror film viewing , check this out!!!! PEACEOOvv",Null,2,4,21 October 2004
The Evil Dead," some of the best female zombies EVER!
","I viewed this film for the first time ever this past week. I really had no idea what to expect - except that I had seen some great effect-clips on TV and that right there made me have to view this. I have seen the sequel to this. I wasn't that impressed with it , although it was not bad at all. But this first film right here , this one has the right stuff... Also this is an original idea to me - as it's the first time I've ever seen a movie based on 3 women being killed and then ultimately turning into quite gruesome zombies... This movie made me jump when I already knew something was about to happen. I really enjoy this film a lot. Very spooky - Very Halloween-esque. Brilliant.... :O HAPPY HALLOWEEN!!",Null,0,1,31 October 2004
Carrie," Carrie For Prom Queen!
","Extremely interesting , unlike any other... Great , great movie. Love horror - love Stephen King - love the story. A lot of stars here also. One of Stephen's finest...and actually captures some truth on the horrors of outcasts of sorts in high school.A very real feeling ensues from this. The beginning and the end get my attention every time. Keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting for the extremes. I know this movie by heart I've watched it so many times.PEACE",Null,2,3,18 September 2004
