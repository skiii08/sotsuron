Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Random Thoughts
","First off, I would have to ask do the film critic's thing we are idiots, or do they have such an ego to think that they can pan a film and make the American public hate a film? The answer has to be no as I am sure after seeing Phantom that they either were watching a different film or were just out to get some publicity from some of their reviews.First I have to say I wished that there would have been some more development of Darth Maul, but I understand this would of added to the film and taken away some other aspects of the story Lucas was trying to present. I felt that the film was an excellent effort, even though there were one of two places within the film where I felt like things just seemed to drag on. I did think Jake Lloyd looked extremely stiff and unbelievable in places in the film but other than that the acting was excellent.  It is a fun film to watch and aids in setting up the next two, it's not meant to be a stand-alone film and if you view that way it will only hurt your opinion of a great movie.One last thought the movie would have been much better without Jar-jar and his useless antics, even though they did make you laugh at time, he was still a distraction.I have to say it was much better than Jedi, but not as good as Empire and Star Wars.",10,0,0,24 May 1999
