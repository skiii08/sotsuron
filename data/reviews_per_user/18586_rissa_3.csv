The Blair Witch Project," what a joke
","This film is to movies what 'The Bridges of Madison County' was to fiction.  It's stupid and banal but worst of all, it's not even particularly scary.  The worst part is having to sit there for 45 minutes waiting for something to happen while the main characters run around screeching at each other like insane twits.  I must admit I probably would have found it more realistic had the movie taken place in a location where it is actually possible to stay lost for more than two or three days like, say, Montana or Colorado, but Burkettesville, Maryland? I can't believe you could walk around for a whole day and not run into a Tastee Freeze by lunch time.",1,0,3,17 August 1999
Saving Private Ryan," faded glory
",Very impressive battle scenes but ultimately the movie left me with the feeling that I was watching two flicks -- the first a very realistic account of war; the second an attempt by Spielberg to create a kind of 'Apocalypse Now' (or 'Heart of Darkness') version of World War II as the main characters stand around and talk about how surreal war is on their journey through the French countryside in search of Pvt Ryan.  The beginning and ending scenes at the graveyard also struck me as silly and preachy.  The D-Day landing by itself is enough of a reminder of what the world owes the men and women who fought and died in WWII without Spielberg Making Sure that We Don't Miss the Point.,6,0,0,20 September 1999
Braveheart," overlong, blurred, historical mishmash
",Veers between Camelot fairy magic and a Monty Python sketch. Wallace was 19 when he began fighting the English -- why is he played here by a 40+ year old man?,1,15,32,17 April 1999
