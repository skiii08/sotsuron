The Lobster," Wth?
","This 'movie' if you can call it that was a complete waste of 119 minutes of my life. Absurd, pointless, and 'jumped the shark' about 30 minutes in. Goodluck watching this and not being bored into a coma.I never review any movies but this one takes the cake.The plot is ridiculous and fails to develop in any way, shape, or form.How this movie is rated a 7.2 is beyond all comprehension. This film should be an insult to the actors involved.I kept waiting for this film to end and it just kept dragging on with nonsense.I cant even summarize the movie because its impossible to pay attention to it after the first 30 minutes. To be honest i read the plot and saw the 7.2 rating and i wanted to see how that was possible.My conclusion is that this rating was absolutely false and mislead plenty of people into wasting their time with this trash.",1,13,17,12 August 2016
