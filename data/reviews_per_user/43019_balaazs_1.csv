Minority Report," Se7en Runner
","Another fairy tale by one of the most professional mainstream directors of our time. Steven Spielberg's journey into the future, where murders can be caught before they even commit a crime. Interesting story, but beneath the surface, we can only find David Fincher's Se7en and Ridley Scott's Blade Runner mixed together with a bit of Spielberg's technocracy.
