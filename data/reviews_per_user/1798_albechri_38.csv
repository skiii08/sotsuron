The Rock," The Pro
","Once again, Connery eats all of his co-star in a movie.After Red October, he is given an opportunity to play a charismatic characters against prejudice and threats. Not mentioning mass destructions.This time, he got a fair act from Nic Cage, but Stanley Godspeed characters doesn't give Cage enough room to expand his acts. What do you expect? Nic Cage has already famous partly for playing a looser. And this time he played another non-field agent who has to work together in a terrorist act with a lethal secret service agent.Ed Harris got an opportunity to kick some good ass, and he did well, as he did in Just Cause (also with Connery). They should stop meeting like this.The action is fast and good.The story is much gripping, and the director of photography provide us with much excellent shoots. Very entertaining.Claire Forlani (if I'm not mistaken)steal an act as Connery's daughter. She shines bright because his face suites the scripts and situation. Good casting!An all time action movie...",8,1,1,22 May 2000
The Blair Witch Project," The Extreme Project
","I give this movie highest ranking for setting up new standard in movie making. It's effects are so big which cause many people to rearrange their concepts of basic movie making. And the integrity between the fictions and facts blend in bigger wave of terror and reality which strokes many moviegoers. It's the face of movie integrity and terror. And I'm sorry if it's gonna be the first, and the last, because somehow I feel that nobody can follow this movie's specific path anymore. The Blair Witch Project is the first and probably the last from extreme-reality movie standard.",Null,0,1,29 April 2000
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Critics Menace
","A film worth enjoyed, not worth to be criticized.Throughout the movie, we see how Lucas trying to fit in the plot he created in Star Wars (1977). It's not easy fitting a 22 years old story into a 30 years old phase. And you can see the plot move fast to make a strong story base towards it's sequels.The computer generated effects are truly needed in making this story, so it's totally foolish to say that the movie over used it. It's like denying bread in a burger.The characters are basicly basic. Not much improvement, except off course the famous Jar Jar Binks who by himself creates lots pros and cons to the fans. To eliminate him is like throwing away our bad and ugly side.He's fool to smart, as good to evil. And a strong representative for the outcasts (whoever they are).And the story doesn't demand much serious acting, as it doesn't demand much serious thinking.It's worth viewing. A basic family movie. May the Force be with you! Mesa love it...!",8,0,1,21 May 2000
Training Day," Growing Pains
","What Denzel Washington does in this movie is similar with whatSean Connery did in the Hunt for Red October, or Al Pacino did inthe Scent of a Woman; he simply outnumbered other casts.From the beginning, like Ethan Hawke, we look at him with a fullawe, such charisma and control and logical reasons towards allthe violence and crimes he does. And sitting on the third seat withthese two characters later proven to be a joyride between realismand idealism flick, similar like what Gene Hackman and WillemDafoe fighting in Mississippi Burning.The mean streets of Los Angeles are well presented, we simplylook at the violence and somehow, with Denzel Washingtoncharm, suddenly we're wondering what kind of life Ethan Hawkelive in, which puts him in such idealism... he's a pure heroschoolboy plunged into a pond of hell which he supposed to knowall the time.Apart from that, the sympathy and charms which supposed to bedrawn into our growing pains towards Denzel character remainsthere. That's the beauty of it, we are so deep with this characterand we can see his madness and his end with some understanding and acceptance.Indeed this is one of Denzel Washington's excellent-steadyperformance. His stare, his goove, his move, indeed casting himin this movie is the best thing the producer have done. And for Ethan Hawke, okay, he's there the way he's suppose to be,the usual boyish purity and idealism. I just hope he can delivermore developing characters as he have done in Alive.As for the storyline, the basic frame is nice, and blend nicely ineveryday's violence, but the pure luck of the rookie somehow blewit up... followed with somehow-a forceful ending.Training Day starts with a realistic starts, but later ends withidealistic standard scripts... but still it's an incredible movie towatch.Highly recommended for evening movie.",Null,1,11,28 October 2001

","She blend to this role perfectly, and that's just the way she acts best. She's born to play as her, and she over gloom and drown others in this movie.The movie is about Julia Roberts, and her assistance in a case. That's the basic plot. And seeing one true Erin Brockovitch fighting for herself and her family should be less entertaining than this.Despite the protests from few actual people whom being potrayed at this movie, this movie itself is very entertaining and educating, not mentioning inspirational.In the drama tradition of the coming 21st century, among high-tech effects and enormous fictions, this movie speed fast and gloom by itself, claiming that the true heart-warm story still remain important and powerful in movie business.A sunday movie-must!",8,0,0,19 May 2000

","It is Tim Burton in more realm style. A bit like Edward Scissorhands with Ed Wood style. The story actually a bit similar with the X-Files, an unsolved mystery, hidden crime, and supranatural matters... Trust No One... But here, Tim Burton, still with his favourite actor, Johny Depp presents more mature ways of movie story telling. The casts are played strict to their characters, and even Danny Elfman score seems more mature, not playful as Mars Attack! or other Burton-Elfman scores, but makes bigger score this way. The effects are usual (for this time), but to be noted, some interesting appearance from Martin Landau, Casper Van Diem, and off course Christopher Walken. Very impressing. Christina Ricci, again after Beetlejuice plays a character which has an attraction to witchcraft. But this time she was covered by Johny Depp strong plays. The picture are beautiful. The Production Designer really do well here. And the cinematography are equal to them, and able to intrepert the story and moods needed.

The story was so thick and digestable which makes us easy following the de-humanization of our mankind.What sets A different mark on this film better than the other is the training stage. It clearly presented the satire face of meN in military. How you may be still intact at the last Day of your inauguration but only if YOU choose to.ANd when you're sent to the front line, you'll loose that choice.That's the time when you're relying on your senses; to believe in God or believing in yourself.The sniper act is really intense, and for me it kinda talks about how we're actually dealing with life itself. Once we've passed certain time of difficulty, we encountered another unseen enemy; more deadly and over-rated.It's truly a brilliant tour of duty for us viewers, because only then we can choose how to live our life... without even have to experience facinG the death itself, in the line of duty.",Null,0,0,30 April 2000

Well, just put it this way, this is a classic Chinese story, and involves lots classic traditional way of thinking. Pride, Family, Honor, Loyalty, and Revenge are some of the classic way of life. And if supported the plot towards making the story not so complicated, but make the characters seems complicated and difficult to understand.The casts are well chosen, besides some objections about their pronunciations, they are well acted and off course, well fighting.This is another example of how the movie technic supports the story and bring out the imaginary scenes which can only be seen through the mind's eyes at first.

","So here it comes, the long awaited movie. The critics dying to find another blame, and the fans dying to know what will it come to another Mission Impossible movie. In brief, we can see John Woo domination here. More than just simplified storyline, also the usual Woo-ish photographic style (slow motion, lots of stills and stare), musical style (which destroys Hans Zimmer's musical talents), and intense-detailed action sequences. Congratulations! From a highly-strategic and tactical Television Series, to a highly self-motivated and one-man-secret mission, this last movie eventually changed into a full actions movie. Just that. There might be some contents exchange here. You can see the more and less lists below: Compared with the first one, you get: More emotional and love scenes More detailed actions and physical fights Tom Cruise exposed! Both body, face, and charismatic style, including awesome acrobatic style and Kung Fu moves (lets make a duel against Keanu Reeves) More sophisticated gadgets More face-offs And less: Less intelligent plots and smart strategies One man mission. This time he shares A BIT with his colleagues Less Mission: Impossible mysteries. This movie is predictable and simple And still: Focused on Ethan Hunt's personal judgements and revenge Left the other IMF agents backed him up with full supports (regardless his emotional interference) In the end, you find yourself looking at an action movie (much better than the last James Bond movie), entitled Mission: Impossible. Wrapped in world-class intelligent, but filled only with first-class actions. The biggest lost might be from the musical score. There's too many new standard applied here, including the opening scene. And the original-heart stamping mission theme song is cut off, and changed into a new rocking theme. For many Tom Cruise or action movies fans, this movie proves to be satisfying. But if you are an original Mission: Impossible fans, you will be disappointed. The first movie is to be comprehended slowly, this one isn't. Just swallow and taste it. It's a must for Tom Cruise and John Woo and especially action movie fans!",8,0,1,4 June 2000

But IF and only if we CAN SEE them? We are forced to accept the world around us in multi dimensional.Another interesting plot is to confront our fear. The next step after accepting is dealing with it. What can we do better with this ability? How should we do it?The Sixth Sense couldn't be done without Harvey's performance. He outcaste Bruce Willis. Playing as a child with supernatural gift, he stand alone like a SITH, a character-race in Star Wars (Lord Sith, Darth Maul, etc.), with power and ability causes other to fear and stay away from them. And here, we can see he is alienated from his mother, and friends. And almost from those spirits he saw. No secrets in that.One plot we are not suppose to reveal is Bruce Willis' character. He is, yes, a psychologist with a deep trauma after some patient attempt to murder him, but here we can see another fact. We are, indeed almost always trying to ignore our fate and conditions. We do our best to cover our pain and failure, as we're trying to move along and to forget it. But unless you're dealing with your deepest pain and failure, you will be able to move forward better.

Freedom from the fear and mental tortures in which he received during his 3 years of imprisonment. Physical tortures and isolation is better compared to mental and thought imprisonment. Nelson Mandela once said 'They can kept me away, but the will not kept away my thoughts and ideas' Maximus Decimus Meridius (if I'm not mistaken), a top rate Roman general, is offered a choice between coming home to his family Spain or take another duty in Rome. He cannot say no and half heartedly decide to rule Rome and stand up for the people and the republic for the glory of the Roman Empire. A condition which was changed by the corrupt politicians and tyrants. Alas, the Empire died and replaced by his son, a disfunctional characters longing for love and acceptance from his father, the last Caesar. Maximus overuled the Caesar and deserted until he was stranded at the gladiator arena. And we are dealing with the imperfect characters; Maximus who is imprisoned by his own rage and pain towards his family, Caesar who is imprisoned by his own fear and hunger for love, his sister who is trapped in her fear and love towards his brother and son and in between good and evil. The audience was placed perfectly in the screen. From the magnificent opening, the barbarian and bloody fights in the collosseum, through many colossal acts and supportive CGI. Russel Crowe (Virtuosity, the Quick and the Dead, the Insider), the humble hero arise not because he is well built like Arnold or with Bruce Willis sinister look. It's because he is merely integrated with the casts and the atmosphere built by the talented movie crews. And so the Gladiator arise, towards the fight for the freedom. A freedom more than just physical, which asks us about how we're dealing towards our own imprisonment. Freedom from fear, hate, anything. Destined to be another Ridley Scott (Blade Runner, Black Rain, Alien, Thelma & Louise) masterpiece, the movie itself speaks with the same ambience like his previous movies. So typical and make us stop and think after the movie ends...",9,0,0,13 August 2000
