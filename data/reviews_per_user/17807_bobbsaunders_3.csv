Ford v Ferrari," A Cheeseburger with extra cheese.
","It is entertaining, its a crowd pleaser, Christian Bale (as always) inhabits the role and Matt Damon is Matt Damon. But this is made to appeal to the widest range of viewers and as such dumbs just about everything down. Its soooo predictable, corny as hell and of course the baddies are so archetypically baddy. There's nothing subtle here, though I did like Marmite product placement.",6,39,68,15 December 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," Hugely Entertaining and Moving - but not a great movie.
","This title seems self contradictory, but although this movie is deeply flawed, I overall loved it. It is very moving and I was genuinely tearing up in the last 10 minutes. Rami Malek is the main reason, with his extraordinary performance that isn't just an impersonation, it provides insights into the darkness and lonliness that drove Freddie to such heights. Lets not also forget that this was largley directed by Brian Singer, a director well skilled in eliciting emotional responses (Silver Lining Playbook). Shure, he departed before finishing it due to creative clashes with Queen, but his skill is on display in many parts of thus movie. If you haven't seen it yet then be prepared for a very hokey first half that gets progressively better throughout. The second half is what makes the movie. Go see it, its fine entertianment.",8,1,4,6 November 2018
Green Book," Trite, cliched, shallow
","How did this film even get considered for an Oscar? This is low grade pap, unchallenging, unbeleivable, dull and so cliched its difficult to believe a fine actor like Mortensen would get involved. And why cast a Scandinavian as a Bronx Italian? Mahershala Ali has done himself no favours either creating a cartoonish 'sophisticate', though the hand doubling during his piano playing was impressive. This is heavy handed populism, shallow and self-righteously preaching, reducing a complex social struggle to simple stereotypes. The cinema landscape of 2018 must be very lacking for this to be lauded as it is. But then in reality it is not, with Masterpieces like Roma on display, its just that the Oscars is not really as important as it would like to be.",3,123,259,31 January 2019
