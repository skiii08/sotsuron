Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Great Movie!
","This was a great movie from start to finish. It has the best special effects ever. I also think it's not only the best Star Wars movie, it's the best movie ever too. It has great acting and a great script. It's totally worth the wait. Thank You Lucas!",10,0,0,20 May 1999
