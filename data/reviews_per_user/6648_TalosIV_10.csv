Catch Me If You Can," Subpar Spielberg
","WOW, what an overrated film!  The movie is simply too long and very poorly paced.  It could have used some voice over narration from Frank.  Similar to 'Goodfellas'.  I kept thinking of Goodfellas while watching this film.  A criminal, period dress, period music.....then they part ways.  The pacing of Goodfellas is brilliant and length is no object.  Those are the two areas CMIYC fails.  It's all over the map with one too many endings.  It is also an embarrassing role for Hanks.  Leo is good. 
I cannot fathom why Spielberg wasted his time with this film or why critics are fawning over it.  As a big Spielberg fan, I am disappointed.  I'm one of the few who thinks A.I. is a masterpiece.  There was just no magic in Catch Me If You Can, nothing special.",Null,1,8,9 January 2003
The Day After Tomorrow," Bah, nonsense
","If you're watching just for the effects, don't bother. There are few and far between. This is a standard, run of the mill, disaster movie. However, it does have a nice left-wing twist, if you're into that sort of thing. See, America is to blame for everything in this movie. Yep. And, we really get our comeuppance, boy howdy! We ignored scientists so long and in this movie, they all get to say 'nananana, we told you so'! Unfortunately, this sort of junk science is perfect for Hollyfraud. Also, unfortunately, the uninformed and ignorant will take it as gospel.Grade: *1/2 out of ****",Null,23,47,29 December 2004
Van Helsing," Boring, loud and obnoxious
","Being a fan of the classic Universal horror pictures, I was both dreading and looking forward to, this movie.  I walked out after one hour.  Loud, no sense of direction, dark, horrible CGI and terrible acting.  Particularly on the part of Richard Roxburgh as Dracula.  The 'brides' were laughable.  The Wolfman was a total waste.  Another example of too much CGI, not enough real makeup.  I'd rather watch The Howling.  Most of the CGI scenes were dark scenes, especially the Wolfman scenes....always a sign of trouble.
I recommend avoiding this film and sticking with the classics.  Go get the Monster Collection DVD and see the difference between great cinema (The Bride Of Frankenstein) and this wretched waste of time (Van Helsing).",Null,8,14,15 June 2004
Dirty Dancing," Dirty Watching
","So, the family is off to a resort where all you do is dance or golf? OK. And you can only dance like 'old folks', unless you find the secret smoke filled room where staff (and random 'lucky' guests) grind against each other?Then, a wonderful abortion subplot? Jennifer Grey looks 16, Swayze 30, ahem. She gets her 'break' due to the aforementioned abortion. Then she gets in line to potentially need one herself, along with her creepy sister. At least their dad can perform them.Just awful. Essentially, a soundtrack in search of a film. No story. Painful dialogue. Very little chemistry.I have friends who love this film. I always figured it would just be cheesy fun. But it's not. It's boring and morally ambiguous, at best. Put ME in that corner, facing the wall.",Null,0,1,7 June 2020
28 Days Later...," Excellent film
","This is not a typical zombie picture.  It is a film about human nature.  The ugly side of humanity.  It is well worth checking out but don't expect another 'Resident Evil'.  It is NOT boring.  It is quite thought provoking. Shot on DV, you will get used to the 'look' of it before you know it.",Null,10,16,29 June 2003
JFK," An amazing film
","So Oliver Stone throws every conspiracy theory he can think of, into the story. So, he uses dubious sources. So he takes 'dramatic license' at every turn, self admitted I might add(on feature length commentary). This movie is just fantastic, hypnotic. Anyone interested in the JFK assassination, should NOT end their research with this film. That would be a huge mistake. However, they should definitely BEGIN their research with this film.Great performances all around. Costner is quite good as Garrison. Decide for yourself, Garrison the hero? Or Garrison the nutjob? Stone paints him as an American hero, with nary a blemish. Perfect in nearly every frame. Pesci is his usual 'over the top' brilliant. Tommy Lee Jones is both normal and utterly creepy and corrupt, as Clay Shaw/Bertrand.See this film. Then do some digging on the net. Still, there will be more answers than questions. But it's a fascinating journey.",Null,2,13,12 October 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Great film, just like the first
","I have not and will not read the books.  I just don't care.  I like film. The world created in these films is brilliant.  You feel completely absorbed.  I couldn't believe 3 hours had gone by!  I understand that purists do not like Rings.  So what.  Purists didn't like Dune, either.  For those of us who are not so 'into it', these are very fun films.  Technically brilliant.  Smeagal/Gollum is particularly impressive. Jar Jar WHO??If you like fantasy, go see these films.  You will enjoy yourself and be swept away from this weary world for a few hours.9/10",Null,0,0,9 January 2003
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," A total misfire
","Perhaps I'm just too stuck in the past. I've never read the book, but I love the original film. Wilder just cannot be replaced. His Wonka was NOT weird, he was just putting on an act to push the kids and parents to their respective breaking points. And it worked.In the original film, the ultimate prize was a secret until the end. In this one, we know some kid is getting something pretty special.Johnny Depp's Wonka is just a freak. He would have little to no chance of becoming ANYTHING in life. I happen to love Depp, but this performance was bad and tough to watch. One or two amusing lines and nothing else.The ending of the original film is much better. A better morality tale, if you will. Handing the everlasting gob-stopper back to Wonka, was perfect.So this one is closer to the book? Hmm...guess I'll have to skip the book then. Of course, Dahl wrote the screenplay to the original film, so what to think? Hmm again.Sorry, the original is a twisted bit of confectionery magic. This one is missing an ingredient or two.",Null,3,6,6 August 2005
The Departed," The best movie I've ever seen, that I also didn't like....SPOILERS
","The acting, direction, cinematography....all first rate. Technically, a brilliant film. The tension built up nicely. The film didn't seem two and a half hours in length.Unfortunately, the payoff didn't work for me and the film, as a whole, was bleak and cynical. I had emotional investment in only one character, Costigan, and he gets his brains blown out. OK, OK...I'll admit, it was nice not to have the typical clich√©d ending. Costigan would have been greeted by applauding cops, like Sullivan was. Then, on the verge of a big promotion, would have handed in his shield and walked out onto and down the street.....camera rises...fade to black.So, I'm OK it didn't end that way. But holy moly, everyone gets shot in the head. Just as a matter of fact, it seems. There's no real 'good guy', again, not necessarily a bad thing. However, you MUST be emotionally invested in someone. For me, it was Leo but just barely.Essentially, everyone was a rat. That was pounded into my pointy little head from the first frame and then pounded in again and again and again. That's a lot to wade through just for that message.Ultimately, the film felt like a waste of time. Everyone dies. Well, except for Dignam. And...every cop is dirty. Not just a little dirty....but shoot the other cop in the head, dirty.Big disappointment. Maybe my love of 'Goodfellas' is blocking me. But I don't think so. It was one of the best films of the 90's.",Null,1,2,28 January 2007
Gladiator," Great film!
","First, I must admit bias.  Any film dealing with ancient Rome stirs my interest.  I had no problem, whatsoever, with the CGI in this film.  Rome has never looked so good!  The sets, costumes and acting are all of superior quality.  The score, by Hans Zimmer, is beautiful.Now, if you want a history lesson...read a textbook.  Just as Titanic was a fictional story within a factual framework, so to is Gladiator.  Few films dealing with history are accurate.  View Gladiator for what it is, a grand spectacle and a great film.",Null,1,1,4 February 2001
