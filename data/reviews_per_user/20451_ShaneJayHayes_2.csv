Casablanca," Quite simply the greatest film in American history
","Casablanca is the consummate Hollywood film.  It is superbly directed, acted, and filmed.  Bogart is amazing, the characters are deep and engaging.This is easily one of the greatest films of all time.  The story is timeless and meaningful, full of heart and should endure for another fifty years with no problems.  A true masterpiece and the benchmark by which all other films should be measured.  If you haven't seen it, you are at a profound loss.  If you have then you know the greatness of this film.",10,158,261,31 December 1999
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Something just wasn't Right
","I was so bummed when I finally saw this film. I had read the book as a child and absolutely was enthralled with it. I had wrongfully assumed that the movie would have that same kind of excitement and adventure for me. The CGI was well done (Kong producers should have asked these guys for help!), the story was alright, the acting was exactly what I expected.Story: My first question for the film would be...what in the world takes so LONG to get the story really moving? This IS the Chronicles of NARNIA right? Well I was afraid the actors would age on screen before my very eyes at the pace the first act was going. There was TOO MUCH (I know you don't hear that often) character development. I didn't ever think they were all going to get through the wardrobe. Once they did the story picked up a little and it felt a little better from there. However it never had that adrenaline rush of excitement one usually gets from movies of this style.As for the acting, hey they are kids, they did pretty darn good for kids. Not all kids are Dakota Fanning.I would recommend this film only for families with children and for those who have not read the book. Why? Kids won't care that the acting is mediocre or that the first act moves like molasses. They will be happy with pictures of snow and hide and seek games. Why people who haven't read the book? Because if you have read the book you will be disappointed (assuming you have a pretty decent imagination) and if you haven't read the book and you are of adult age, you probably aren't going to read it now so you might as well see the movie.",6,0,2,15 December 2005
