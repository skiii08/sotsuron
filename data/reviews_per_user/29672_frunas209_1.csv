Marie Antoinette," Beheaded By Boredom!!!!!
","I just finished watching what I am considering one of the worst movies ever! I was going to turn it off 45 minutes into the movie but I decided to finish watching..so that I could never set eyes on it again. Kristen Dunst's portrayal of Marie Antoinette was mind numbing. If this is how Marie Antoinette truly acted I would have murdered her before she was even crowned Queen. I felt the pastries in the movie were better portrayed and acted than the so called thespians. Each actor committed cinematic torture when they signed up for this SNOOZER of a film. Sophia C. I believe you are an amazing young talent (just what Hollywood needs) but this one here didn't do you any justice. I say scratch this one off your resume FOREVER!!! I must say though I rather did enjoy the soundtrack. TWO THUMBS UP for the soundtrack, EIGHT FINGERS DOWN for the movie!",2,1,2,4 January 2008
