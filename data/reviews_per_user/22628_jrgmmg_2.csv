The Avengers," Do not miss this movie!
","Short and sweet, probably THE best super-hero movie ever made. I went in to this with some trepidation. Most flicks with an ensemble cast waste way too much time and energy on the special effects and action and not enough on character development. (Like those horrible Batman flicks pre-Christopher Nolan.) But the Avangers are the exception to the rule. This was just a fantastic movie. The fight scenes and action moments were spectacular without going over the top ala' Transformers and the character development and interaction was superb and totally entertaining. Some of the most enjoyable moments of the movie was the banter between the characters. And I won't ruin this for anyone but stay for the end to catch a glimpse of the next bad guy. Apparently it's been announced on the web but I didn't know until I seen the film. I was blown away. He looked awesome! What a great flick.",9,1,4,5 May 2012
Casino Royale," Outstanding
","I have no idea what all this negative email is about concerning this flick. Pay absolutely no attention to it. I've been a Bond fan ever since my father took me to see Goldfinger back in 1964 and as far as I'm concerned, this is the absolutely the best Bond flick by far since those early great films with Sean Connery. This is simply a magnificent movie on any level and Daniel Craig is the Bond we've all been waiting for since Sean decided to retire his tux. Daniel Craig brings a charisma and dangerous edge to the Bond character that even Connery only sometimes was able to achieve. As for the film's arch enemy, Mads Mikkelson is truly superb as the villainous Le Chiffre. It's been said that the mark of a truly great Bond film can be measured by it's antagonist's performance and it's body of villains as well as it's beautiful women. And this film certainly delivers in both regards. In most Bond movies the ending is so predictable with no surprises or plot twists but Casino Royale manages to throw a remarkable curve at you as it reaches the films final climax. Me personally? I can't wait for Daniel Craig Bond movies.",9,1,7,15 July 2007
