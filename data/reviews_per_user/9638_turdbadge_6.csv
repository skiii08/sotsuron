The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," copy and paste of Battle Royale 2
","Abnormally, i'd generally like to experience remade flicks. More so the if i loved the original. I know there are extremely few which equals or excels to the original but it's not a big problem for me 'cause i don't even expect them to. It is to me like a bonus track of a beloved album, no more no less.So i got no hesitation in checking Hunger Games as well (i was even excited actually) 'cause the original must be in my all-time best 10, but, oh my..I won't say any more about this XEROX COPY crap. (copied on retarded machine, moreover) Nough said by nough people.Now one thing i just can't believe is how this could be legal. As far as i've read on internet articles, Suzanne Collins and her people haven't even paid a penny to the original Battle Royale makers for doing this, which means Hunger Games is not an official remake of Battle Royale. Then what the h..! is Hunger Games's identity? Some's gonna say it's JUST BASED ON or INSPIRED thing but you know it's way beyond those kinds. Then what? Sort of Homage thing ? Yea possible, but Suzanne Collins and her company have hardly mentioned about the original on either official ads & reports or non-official comments. Instead, Suzanne Collins's kept saying she's got a bit INSPIRED ONLY and Hunger Games is totally different from Battle Royale 2 or something like that. Besides, more importantly, while shamelessly copying scenes-by-scenes from Battle Royale 2, Suzanne Collins intentionally missed the KEY-POINT of Battle Royale 2's story for his own audiences' taste, for COMMERCIAL PURPOSE in other words. Then how can we call it Homage anyway ? My conclusion is : Hunger Games is not only a copy crap, it's rather A CRIME, LITERALLY. I don't understand why Battle Royale 2 makers let them make money with this stolen thing.Am i disappointed ? No i'm fine i didn't even expect. I'm just p***ed and upset for this shitmakers' shamelessness that's all.",1,22,31,4 February 2015
Divergent," A teeny-bopper young adult dystopia copycat of Hunger Games/Battle Royale
","Oh dear god why'd I go see this movie?! If I wanted Hunger Games, I should've went to see Hunger Games. Wait! No, I take that back. If I wanted Hunger Games, I should've watched Battle Royale. Cause if I'm honest, this movie is a copycat of a copycat. Oh how I miss the good old days! The good old days where if you went to see a movie set in a dystopian future where a corrupt government put its citizenry in peril on a whim, it was rated R because it contained great special effects, gritty foul language laced dialogue, and contained adult themes. But this! Okay! I understand the concept of movie studios dumbing this type of film down so tweens can partake in something that makes them feel like they are cool, or makes them feel like their rebelling. Even though they aren't really, they're just soaking up things that have been rehashed from what was cool 25+ years ago. Please! Tween society, realize that when everyone is a rebel, the only true rebellion is against rebellion itself!",10,2,4,28 July 2014
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Haven't got a clue
","It's not often I watch a film where I haven't got a clue what's going on, but that's what happened in the case of X-Men: Days of Future Past: come the ending, I still hadn't the foggiest about what I'd just watched. The plot, if you can describe it thus, seems to be about a young man who's advised to commit suicide by his aged mentor, only to return as an ass-kicking 'demon warrior' with special supernatural powers. His job? To bump off the rest of the 'demon warriors' that are out there.There's some English religious mumbo-jumbo talk in an effort to explain the discrepancies of the plot, but you'll be bypassing that in favour of checking out the various warriors and their special skills. By far the most interesting is an immortal fighter whose body bears the scars of each person he's killed â€“ a neat idea that sadly isn't explore to the fullest extent, as it could have been with a more skilled writer behind it. In some ways, this is like a grown-up version of X-MEN, with the addition of a series of bloody and sadistic fight scenes.There's action aplenty, and lots of CGI blood, but the choreography is pretty poor, it has to be said. Even worse is the script, which makes no effort to characterise each of the principals, so that the demon warriors themselves are more often than not interchangeable. The acting is dodgy to say the least, and director Bryan Singer needs to go back to film school to figure out how to make a real movie next time, instead of this silly, noisy nonsense.",1,9,21,12 October 2014
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Anderson's Most Solid Effort to Date
","That an intense and intelligent movie this is. As others have noted, the nods to Italian cinema of the 70's era are bold and brash, yet it's also a quintessential Englishman abroad drama. The atmosphere created by the soundtrack was electric and it felt like hearing the world with new ears when I left the picture house at the end.Don't expect a neat narrative, this film plays with your senses and your understanding of whose doing what to who and why. It's exceptionally claustrophobic throughout, and the disconcerting edits constantly leave you asking more questions about what's going to take place next.",1,7,20,17 May 2014
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Spidey Gets All Twilight On Us
","In 2012, I was happy to finally see a Spider-Man movie with a lead that I felt embodied the Twilight characters I grew up reading. The plot itself might not have been anything to write home about, but it was, at least, a good movie and worth the IMAX ticket price I paid to see it. Fast forward two years to the second installment of the re-booted series and I'm practically praying for terrible ticket sales in hopes that Marc Webb and his team of writers have learned from their mistakes with this one. In short, the film was spent mostly circling around Peter's internal conflict to let go of Gwen per her dying father's request as well as Peter's search for answers and some sort of closure with the sudden departure and deaths of his parents as a child. I understand these are two things that needed to be included, but to span the breadth of over two hours worth of running time? Aside from that, we're treated to the Batman Forever-esque depictions of Electro and Rhino (very briefly for the latter) and the sub-par, paint-by-number acting chops of Dane DeHaan as Harry Osborn/the Green Goblin. Aaaand that's the movie. No, seriously. A few action sequences here and there to at least whet the appetites for the kids and mouth-breathers, but that's really it. I give Jamie Foxx credit for evoking sympathy for his character early in the movie, but overall it was a trudgingly-paced and uninteresting flop of a superhero movie that will either be remembered for doing nothing differently from Sam Raimi's Spider-Man films or forgotten for exactly the same reason. 8",5,1,5,8 June 2014
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," the Battle Royale deception
","I enjoyed the first ripoff, but Catching Fire never did. The first 45 minutes or so of this movie should have been boiled down to about 15 minutes, seriously. I grew very weary waiting for something, anything, to happen. We need more BR reenactments and definitely more Liam Hemsworth (who is wasted here). The rest of the movie wasn't much better, and if the next 2 installments follow suit, there's just no point to continue watching these films. The Hunger Games: Catching Fire was essentially just a placeholder for the third movie in the series, whenever that comes out. There was not a whole lot of meat, just a lot of subtle plot-building that doesn't resolve at the movie's open ending.",1,43,85,23 May 2014
