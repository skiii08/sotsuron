Casablanca," Everybody comes to this one, again and again
","Another perfect movie. Also, another prime example of a movie that gets better with multiple viewings. A few lines from Casablanca have become as much a part of the English language as the words of Shakespeare. 'Round up the usual suspects!' 'I'm shocked, shocked!' 'I was misinformed.' Heck, Casablanca has even given popular culture a line that wasn't in the movie: 'Play it again, Sam.' Why do we love this film? Action. Intrigue. Love. Betrayal. Loyalty. Redemption. And, most important, Dooley Wilson performs 'As Time Goes By.' You've got to like this one. After all, 'Everybody comes to Rick's.'",Null,0,0,31 January 1999
Chinatown," Smart film-noir
","Smart film-noir draws me in every time. This film is one of the smartest. What casting! The star of the film is 1930's Los Angeles. Jack Nicholson is the flawed good guy, Jake Gittes. Film legend John Huston is the bad guy. The theme is the exercise of power. When Jake was slapping Faye Dunaway, my dismay matched his when we both suddenly understood exactly what she was saying. Few movie moments equal that one for provoking sheer astonishment mixed, finally, with horrified comprehension.",Null,0,1,31 January 1999
Citizen Kane," It really is the landmark film everyone says it is.
","Sure, 'Citizen Kane' unscrupulously savages publishing magnate William Randolph Hearst, but who cares about scruples when you can experience film direction as stylish and a story as fascinating at this! Welles deserves every accolade he's received for using 'Citizen Kane' to redefine the art of the motion picture. And he was just a kid when he made it! Hearst wouldn't allow this film to be mentioned in his papers. He probably was just envious of the life of Charles Foster Kane.",Null,1,2,31 January 1999
The Terminator," Together with part 2, groundbreaking science fiction
","I can't really discuss 'The Terminator' without also discussing 'Terminator II.'  Arnold Schwarzenegger plays essentially the same character in both films, but in Part I he's a (really) bad guy, and in Part II he's the hero. It's a time travel story in which a humanoid robot from the future arrives in the present to murder a woman so she'll never give birth to a child who is destined to grow up to lead what to all appearances is an incredibly unsuccessful fight against humanoid robots in the future. And that's just the first film. In the second film the child is already born and another humanoid robot from the future, a spooky shape-shifter this time, arrives in the present to murder the kid, but a third humanoid robot (Arnold II), programmed this time to do good deeds, follows the bad robot to the present and tries to protect the kid and rescue the kid's mother who is in an insane asylum because she keeps insisting that robots from the future are trying to kill her. Did you get all that? I'm a sucker for a good time-travel story, and the next time this one's on TV, I'll be back. This is first-class science fiction Â– it's entertaining and it makes me think. (I also really liked Arnold in 'Total Recall,' but I can never really work up an interest in watching it again because I can't make up my mind whether the story is taking place in the real world or in a brain aneurysm.)",Null,0,0,31 January 1999
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," I wish the fall had killed them
","Have you ever seen a picture of a 19th Century outlaw?  Did he look like Robert Redford?  Did he look like Paul Newman?  Or, better yet, have you ever seen a picture of a 19th Century outlaw's woman?  Did she look like Katherine Ross?  And even much better yet, can you picture 19th Century outlaws riding double on bicycles through a lush countryside while B.J. Thomas sings about raindrops falling on their heads?  This isn't a western; it's a Hallmark Card.  'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' stars the three most unlikely outlaws Hollywood had to offer at the end of the 1960's.  The two male leads, who were to work together so perfectly a few years later in 'The Sting,' are not believable, sympathetic, or even interesting in their parts.  This was one of the most popular movies of its time, but even when I was young and had no taste, I was astonished by its totally anachronistic look and sound.  If you want to enjoy a film that features 19th Century outlaws, try 'My Darling Clementine.'  Don't waste your time on this one.",Null,2,4,30 January 1999
MASH," A classic war-is-hell movie
","No, not the very wonderful TV series. The Robert Altman film with Donald Sutherland as Hawkeye, Elliott Gould as Trapper John, and Radar as Radar. This is a dark comedy, but it's a delight from beginning to end. And even more effectively than the TV show, the movie illustrates the complete insanity of war. (But even the movie doesn't depict Jesus on the cross hanging from a helicopter. For that you'll need to read the book.) Like most Altman films, this one is episodic. It's also gritty, grim, bloody, offensive, and charming. And Frank Burns (Robert Duvall) is not a character watered down and humanized for television. This is an example of a film so rich in detail (like Altman's 'Popeye,' come to think of it) that it demands multiple viewings.",Null,66,92,31 January 1999
Fargo," The Coen Brothers stub their toes
","'Fargo,' by the gifted producer/director/writer team of Joel and Ethan Coen, reminds me of one of their previous films which I enjoyed very much, 'Blood Simple.'  Like 'Blood Simple,' 'Fargo' is a tale of crime gone wrong.  This time it's a kidnapping plan that spins horribly out of control, leading to several grisly murders.  Also, like 'Blood Simple,' 'Fargo' is a comedy. But this time, for me, the humor didn't work.  'Fargo' has been described as something of a warmhearted tribute by the Coen brothers to the wonderful people of their home state, Minnesota.  No it's not.  It's a nefarious assault on decent people whose main offense against humanity, apparently, is that they are friendly and trusting.  And they talk funny.  I happened to see this film in Washington, D.C., where others in the audience repeatedly guffawed in superior tones at what were supposed to be silly rubes on screen.  Several audience members seemed to consider it their personal duty to laugh loudly and pointedly in sophisticated derision at decent, open and honest Minnesotans.  And the way they talk.  Maybe having grown up in the southern United States makes me particularly sensitive to accent bigotry.  I dunno.  But I liked the good people in this film, and it annoyed me that the Coen brothers portrayed them with contempt.  Warmhearted contempt is still contempt.  You've been away from home too long, guys.",Null,0,0,30 January 1999
Independence Day," Bad science fiction
","Robert Wise once made an intelligent film about an alien invasion of Earth. It was called 'The Day the Earth Stood Still,' and it's still an entertaining and enlightening work of science fiction.  'The Day the Earth Stood Still' is everything that 'Independence Day' is not.  The former appeals to our adult intellect.  The latter appeals to what's left of the 12-year-old inside us.  Sometimes that's OK, when it works.  I'm looking forward to the new Star Wars movie as much as anyone.  But aren't we getting a little tired of 'government conspiracy' storylines?  I've got news for you: If the U.S. President can't keep a little Oval Office hanky-panky secret, his minions certainly can't hide a bunch of aliens out in the New Mexico desert.  The 'X-Files,' government conspiracy plot has run its course for me.  (What's that you say?  The whole Monica thing is really a plot by the aliens to put one of their own, Albert Gore, Jr., into the top job?) ) Actually, I'd love to see a film that intelligently explores what might really happen if the aliens landed.  But 'Independence Day,' with it's overwhelming special effects and evil/cute aliens that say 'uh-oh' before they're blasted to smithereens, is not that movie.",Null,0,1,31 January 1999
Gone with the Wind," Frankly, I just don't know...
","I go back and forth on this one. 'Gone With the Wind' was reissued when I was just a kid, and all my parents' friends were talking about how they loved this definitive romantic tale of the War Between the States. So my level of anticipation was high when my folks took me downtown to see it at the old Loews State Theater in Memphis. I was not disappointed. It was one of my first *adult* films, and I was swept away by the story and the music and the Technicolor cinematography and the sheer power of the melodrama. (A few days later, when I tried to obtain the book at the library, I actually had to get special permission to check it out with my juvenile library card.) I must have read the book ten times during junior high and high school. After I graduated college the movie was re-reissued, and I took a date to see it. She hated it and so did I. I couldn't believe I'd ever enjoyed such an overwrought potboiler. Then, some years later, Ted Turner restored the print to its original glory and I watched it on television. This time I deemed it a masterpiece. So, 'Gone With the Wind' is on my list of films I'll watch again. But frankly, I don't know whether I'll give a damn.",Null,1,1,31 January 1999
The Princess Bride," Read the book
","I read the book first; a smart move as it turns out.  The book is full of swashbuckling heroes and daring rescues and stunning miracles and sly humor. The book is extraordinarily entertaining.  But the movieÂ….  Lots of people seem to like this film.  But compared to the book (how shall I put this delicately?), the movie sucks.  Buttercup looks only like a pretty girl, not the hypnotizing beauty of the book.  Fezzik looks only like Andre the Giant, not the world-class strongman of the book.  And Westley looks like a wimp. A wimp.  A total wimp.  The great hero Westley is a wimp wimp wimp.  Even his mustache is a joke, and it makes me sick to look at it.  I hate this movie. Please read the book.",Null,0,1,30 January 1999
Lawrence of Arabia," White Man to the Rescue
","Golly, I want to like this movie.  I keep reading all the rapturous reviews and I'm told that this is a cinematic masterpiece with unforgettable images and a magnificent score and unsurpassed acting and on and on.  Maybe I should have seen it in a theater with a big screen.  Maybe then I'd have been blown away by the beauty and the majesty and the awe inspiring desert vistas.  But I have never seen it in a theater with a big screen.  I've seen it only on TV, and that leaves me with little but Lawrence and his story to consider.  And I don't like Lawrence.  I don't connect with him; I don't understand him; I don't understand why the Arabs seem to be drawn to him; and I just don't believe him as a character.  (What's that business about prancing around and waving arms with white robes blowing in the wind? Lawrence seemed to believe himself a much more impressive human being than I found him to be.)  And I don't like the story. The Great White Man, the closest thing to God on Earth, brings hope and trust to the poor unenlightened Arab tribes.  Spare me.   (",Null,1,3,30 January 1999
Chariots of Fire," Maybe I missed the point
","Here's a film that seems to affect some people profoundly, but which leaves me completely cold.  I've seen it only once, and that was a long time ago. But I'll never forget my total disappointment in the film, coupled with my dismay that I had somehow completely missed the point.  I expected to like it very much.  That theme music by Vangelis is soul-stirring, and being familiar with the music before I entered the theater, I expected a story every bit as thrilling.  But what I got was a lot of running, a glut of pained expressions, and a religious, won't-work-on-the-Sabbath prig, who didn't bother to check the calendar before leading his countrymen to believe he'd represent them in the Olympics.  Great painters, poets, playwrights, inventors, mathematicians, teachers, (I could go on) leave the world a better place for their having been among us.  Great runners leave us with records that get broken.  The guys in this movie ran fast for their day and thought very highly of themselves, but they weren't the great heroes they were purported to be.  Maybe I didn't completely miss the point after all.",Null,6,9,31 January 1999
Mission: Impossible," Impossible to believe
","How in the world could this film ever have been a commercial success?  I cannot believe this one didn't die like 'The Avengers' the weekend after it opened.  But some people did like it.  Unbelievable.  I don't want to give away anything here, but I really must ask, 'Would you accept a story in which Sherlock Holmes turned out to be Jack the Ripper?  Would you accept a story in which James Bond assassinates the Queen?'  Well, not me.  This movie's plot was full of holes, the main character behaved stupidly, and the special effects showed activities that were outrageously impossible.  (A helicopter tethered to a bullet train was actually FLYING in a tunnel!  I couldn't even laugh at that, it was so ridiculous.)  Some misguided souls say they like a movie that doesn't make them think.  The trouble with this one is that you MUSN'T think about it, else you will seek out the producers to demand back the two hours of your life you have wasted.",Null,0,0,31 January 1999
Some Like It Hot," A classic farce, a love story, and a suspense thriller
","Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis are musicians who witness a mob hit and have to go into hiding. They disguise themselves as women, join an all girls band which features Marilyn Monroe, and catch a train to a tropical resort where things get very complicated. Supposedly Monroe was a real pain to work with on this film, but her performance is completely charming. Joe E. Brown as the older gentleman who falls in love with Jack Lemmon (he's a woman, remember) is absolutely hilarious. This is a classic farce, a love story, and a suspense thriller all in one film.",Null,1,1,31 January 1999
It's a Wonderful Life," Every time a bell rings I think of this movie
","Suicidal George Bailey is given a chance to see what the world would be like if he had never been born, and through his story we learn that our actions affect other people in ways we may not comprehend. The scene I love most, that still gives me chills just thinking about it, is the scene in the cemetery when George discovers that his brother Harry, whom he rescued from drowning when they were kids, wasn't the only hero who saved some soldiers on a troop transport. 'Those men died! Harry wasn't there to save them because you weren't there to save Harry!' In the 1970's, when blank VHS tapes cost $30 and I had to be selective in using them, this was the first film I recorded for my collection. It's a perfect film. I wouldn't change a frame. And I'll always get teary when Clarence gets his wings.",Null,0,3,31 January 1999
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," This cuckoo laid an egg
","Jack Nicholson is crazy.  Or, maybe he's not crazy; maybe it's the SYSTEM that's crazy.  Yeah, that's the ticket. The SYSTEM has gone crazy and Jack's the only sane guy and of course he's been thrown in the loony bin because he likes to CHALLENGE THE SYSTEM.  And then Jack meets Nurse Ratched ('Wretched,' get it?), an RN who graduated from the Joseph Mengele School of Nazi Nursing with a Master's Degree in mean.  Boy is she ever mean to Jack and all the other inmates who look loony but aren't REALLY.  And then Jack takes all the inmates on a school bus ride which is fun and then he takes them on a fishing trip which is even more fun.  And then Jack treats everybody to an orgy with prostitutes which is the most fun of all!  And the next morning the Stuttering Boy awakens to discover he's neither a virgin nor a stutterer.  It's a MIRACLE!  But then Nurse Ratched is mean to him. Oooh, naughty Nurse Ratched.  (She's so darn cute when she's mean.)  And that makes Jack angry so he tries to strangle Nurse Ratched (YEAHHHHH!!) but he doesn't (AWWWWÂ…).  And then Nurse Ratched takes MEAN to an all-new level. What a GREAT story that is!  And so full of DEEP MEANINGS too!   (As irony often doesn't translate very well onto the Internet, let me be clear.  I hated this film from beginning to end.  I cannot be entertained and I do not wish to be enlightened by experiencing man's inhumanity to man.)",Null,1,3,30 January 1999
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," This film's force will be with us for a long time
","In early summer 1977 I found myself taking in the sights on Times Square one Saturday afternoon, and I came across a long line of people waiting to get into Loews Theater (which turned out to have a screen, oh, about a half mile wide) to see 'Star Wars.' For several months I'd been intrigued by a silver-gray movie poster at the Memphian Theater back home that said simply, 'Coming to Your Galaxy This Summer: Star Wars.' My feet were tired from walking all over New York, so I decided, 'What the heck,' and got in line. When I bought my ticket I was given a pin-on button, about three inches in diameter, upon which was printed against a blue field of stars, 'May the Force Be With You.' 'Wonder what that means?' I thought, and I pinned it on my shirt. I found a seat and for the next two hours, as I sat suspended in space from the front row of the balcony, 'Star Wars' transported me, as no movie had before, to adventures in a time and place I could never have imagined. 'Star Wars' took my breath away. Almost literally. When the Millennium Falcon kicked into overdrive and the stars stretched, I nearly fell out of the balcony. The next day I traveled home and told all my friends that they would soon see a new science fiction movie that was about to sweep the country and they would all love it. They thought I was nuts, but I was mostly right of course. (Can you believe some people don't love 'Star Wars?') Now I have the new version of all three 'Star Wars' films on LaserDisc, and I expect to continue enjoying them for years to come. And yes, I like the new versions better. The Jabba the Hutt scene was an especially welcome addition to the first film.",Null,1,2,31 January 1999
Back to the Future," A Perfect Film
","I think some movies are perfect. By that I simply mean that given the chance, I wouldn't change a frame. This is one of those movies. The structure of the film is convoluted and full of surprises, but always easy to follow. The first quarter or so of the film is all setup for gags to come later. The viewer must be alert, because there's a payoff for virtually everything that's said or done. This film demonstrates better than any history book that as the decades pass, our understanding of the world changes in ways we don't immediately comprehend. Watch as a 1955 character demands a time traveler tell him who is President of the United States in 1985. His reaction, upon hearing it's Ronald Reagan, is priceless.",Null,1,2,31 January 1999
The Godfather," Pulp novel = movie masterpiece
","Back in 1972 I was much too intellectual to be interested in a movie based on a pulp novel. Then I was dragged to see 'The Godfather' and my outlook on popular entertainment changed forever. If 'The Godfather' was outstanding, how could 'Godfather II' be better? I dunno, but it is. The movies spin a tale of family, and they illustrate how the sins of the fathers, even loving fathers, will cast tragedy across the generations. Steer clear of part III, a redundant tale that begged never to be made.",Null,0,2,31 January 1999
