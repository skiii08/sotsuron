Sucker Punch," 144 minutes too long.
","Opening in a interesting,imaginative fashion I was hooked. The use music and no dialogue was a truly inspired decision, but from then on, the film went down hill.The problem I have with this movie was the acting. Emily Browning delivered a lacklustre performance as 'baby doll', believe it or not, someone cannot create interesting viewing when their facial expression is constantly set on 'bambi'. Along with the other actress', Browning tries to portray herself as some sort of female bad ass, but just ends up looking like a toddler playing make believe.The graphics where stunning, and where one of the highlights of the film, along with Carla Gugino's turn as the doctor.To be honest, this film had a lot of potential, but failed to pull it out of the bag. A lot of it didn't make sense and the bits that did where boring and predictable.",3,4,9,2 May 2011
