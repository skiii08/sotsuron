3:10 to Yuma," Doesn't Anyone Realize $200 Ain't What it Used to Be?
","There is all this criticism over $200 being offered to kill Wade's captors. Do those claiming this is 'stupid' not realize there is something called inflation; that the penny candy on 'Little House' now cost a buck? As for Wade's stupidity for getting caught, ever consider that part of him wanted to get caught? Why else would he be waiting around knowing the lawmen were back? 'Stupid script!' Or possibly Wade was done. But as he said, you have to be ruthless to run his gang.So if he were to change, he'd need to be freed of his posse. Getting on the train to Yuma might just be his ticket to a new life when he busts out of the caboose or the prison (which he claims to have done twice already).Killing his own men seemed over the top, but when you ponder that he probably didn't want to be shackled to these guys anymore, it becomes easier to swallow.I did find Russell Crowe a bit too glib, but Christian Bale was spot on.The look and sound of the movie were fantastic. Not a truly great movie, but definitely a good one, with some exceptional elements.",8,0,1,20 July 2008
Minority Report," Professionally Done, Nothing Sublime
","This is a very good Hollywood movie that benefited from excellent actors and superb production design--the best money could buy. But was it brilliant, sublime.? No.Like many Speilberg films, it ends about two scenes too late. These final syrupy scenes insult the audience and tie things up too neatly. It's as if he wants the audience to leave the theatre feeling 'everything was beautiful and nothing hurt.'The premise of the movie is a good one, but the Minority Reports actually are less important than a murder that was covered up. The story and script have holes that are pretty big and cliches aplenty. The annoying Feds encroaching on local turf. The mentor turned opponent. The lovely wife who looks like she removed all worldly flaws in a 120 degree yoga studio--hey I'm not complaining. The black side-kick/friend who doesn't get very much screen time.It's good. It's a fine movie. But it's not moving art. Should it be? Maybe not. Could it have been? I think so. But when you're buying Cracker Jack, you really shouldn't look for Coupe de Ville at the bottom (Meatloaf anyone?). Just a toy surprise. And this one is nice and leaves an impression about as long as those phony tattoos.",Null,0,0,25 June 2002
Malcolm X," Oscar??
","It's taken me a while to watch this film. I have to say that it's got it's problems. Mainly, the beginning is way too long and looks like it was shot for a different movie. And there are other nits.However, Denzel Washington shines. He gets better and better and better as the film goes on. Wade through the first 30 mins, because the rest is well worth it.I agree that Russell Crowe got gypped during the Academy Awards for 'A Beautiful Mind.' But Denzel clearly deserved the Oscar for 'Malcom X' (Pacino won it that year for 'Scent of a Woman'). Does this make it all fair? Not really, but maybe a little.",9,1,6,20 June 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," It Was Okay
","Great? No. Acceptable, yes. C+/B-. Go see it for what it is, not for what it's not (a religious experience).Portman and Christensen were better than reviewed. But there were some moments that just kind of made me want to gag. The effects weren't really any more impressive than Phantom Menace's--except of Yoda's duel at the the end.I've watched the first two movies many times. Will watch this one again? I doubt it.",6,0,0,17 May 2002
Ocean's Eleven," What Could Have Been
","This viewed like a very competent workman's like effort with almost no passion. I found myself truly bored while watching the planning and execution of the biggest heist in history.There were few surprises and little suspense. And I really didn't like the mental flashbacks, ala Spike Jones' 'Three Kings.'Yes, it's making tons of money at the box-office, but nobody claims the restaurant that's served billions has the best cuisine.",6,0,1,11 December 2001
Meet Joe Black," Is Your Time Really That Valuable?
","So many people have complained about the length of this movie. What were all these people going to do with the `offending' 45 minutes? Save the world? Find a cure for cancer--or even bunions?This movie doesn't have the pacing of Moesha (whom I admire) but why should it? To use a sports analogy, it's more like a baseball than football or basketball. It unravels at its own pace. It provides respite, not competition, to our chaotic environs.I have had the opportunity to observe a few of the Robert Parishes of the world. They are much more complicated men than how they are portrayed in Hollywood projects. This movie daringly casts a wealthy man as a deeply moral rather than corrupt.Anthony Hopkins trumpets why life is to be treasured and death despised. Why the person for you might NOT be the one right under your nose, but rather the person you have yet to really meet. That it's worth it to wait for the special somebody who makes your life more vibrant and you a better person to boot. In a world fascinated with the macabre and marketed to the ordinary, such messages are sorely needed.Being a member of the `Y' chromosome sex, I cannot truly be a Brad Pitt fan. But I must say he did a fine job and had great chemistry with the rest of the cast, all of whom were first-rate. And that death chose to experience life through the body of a morally conscious businessman (instead of a rock star) shows where this movie's values reside.Meet Joe Black was a brave and inspired movie. I hope at least some give it another shot.",10,15,28,14 October 2001
Annie Hall," Glad to Have Finally Seen It
","What a gem of a movie. Woody is at his finest and Diane Keaton is adorable. It also perfectly captures/satirizes the 70's, NY, LA and gentile and Jewish mindsets. This movie really shows how great Woody Allen can be.",10,0,0,22 December 2001
Ran," Brilliant
","Is Kurosawa the David Lean of Japan or what? This is a brilliant film about man (and woman's) desire for territory, flesh, revenge and respect. That which most powerfully motivates leads to demise. Never predictable, this film has as many ebbs and eddies as the human soul.",10,1,3,20 December 2001
Born on the Fourth of July," Uncomfortably Timely
","I understand that Paul Newman encouraged Tom Cruise to do this film to counter balance jingoistic flicks like Top Gun. When I first saw it, I was not all that impressed. How the times have changed.While we hug our bravest firemen and hang flags from our car windows, we forget the dirty side of war. This film reminds us. But today, times are if anything, only more complicated. Unlike Vietnam, our country was attacked and innocent civilians were the casualties.Ben Laden and his associates told 60 Minutes months ago that the United States' weakened military resolve has emboldened them. So what do we do? I don't know. Except I pray to God every day for a miracle. What else is there to do?",Null,0,1,18 September 2001
