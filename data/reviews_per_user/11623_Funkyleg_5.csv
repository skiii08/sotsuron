Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not horrible, but not good either.
","Ok, well, let me just start by saying that I am a bigger Star Wars fan than most people.  I am not, however, going to brainwash myself into thinking that Episode One matched up in any way to the other Star Wars films.  When the Special Edition Star Wars films were released with their computer enhancements, some were good (usually backgrounds), but some were bad (Jabba and Han's conversation).  When is Lucas going to realize that computers can only do so much.  A lot of the charm of the first 3 movies was the amazing puppetry.  At least they were something real and tangible rather than a computer generated mirage.  I mean, look at Chewy, for crying out loud! He's a big, furry costume.  If he were a character nowadays they wouldn't bother with the costume and make some ridiculous looking computer genrated...thing.  And the fact is, computers make things look too busy. That may sound kind of dumb, but just stay with me.  I don't care how close to real motion a lot of this computer stuff looks, it's STILL NOT THERE. All of the computer characters movements are too exagerated and deliberate. And no wonder the acting was a problem...they had computer generated main characters.  The entire movie they were talking to nothing in a computer generated nowhere.  I won't even get into Jar Jar and the idiotic accents of the Viceroys.  Basically, I can watch this movie, but there's many parts that make me cringe.  On it's own it's an OK movie.  Compared to the other Star Wars movies, it hasn't the heart.",Null,0,1,21 August 2000
Apocalypse Now," One of the most chilling depictions of the horrors of war and man.
","Apocalypse Now is quite possibly one of thee greatest films ever made, and definitely a masterpiece.  Not only does Coppola depict the horrors of war, he also examines the savagery which is at the heart of all mankind.  Coppola does not show the horrors of war the same way most war movies do.  Saving Private Ryan used gruesome visuals and intense drama.  Platoon attempted to show the interaction between men, and their loss of innocence.  Apocalypse Now is much more creative.  The creative approach is perhaps shown best in Roert Duvall's character, Lt. Col. Kilgore.  Coppola uses the humor of this man who is so obsessed with surfing, he attacks a village primarily so he and his men could surf there.  This was an incredibly creative way to show how a man can become so insane while not becoming detached from relationships with other people. Beyond the depiction of war, Apocalypse Now attempts to show the evil that is at the heart of every man.  This is not necessarily to say that all men are evil, however, it is saying that all men are capable of such evil, and are often attracted to it.  As the men travel further and further down the river in the movie, the things they see become more savage and insane, as well as the crew itself.  So, in essence as they travel further down the river, they travel further into the evil heart of man.  This is the main theme behind the short story which the movie was based on, 'Heart of Darkness' by Joseph Conrad.  The end of the river is the culmination of all evil.  A display of what man holds inside him and what he is capable of. Apocalypse Now is less of a war movie, and more of a journey into the heart of evil.",9,0,0,11 March 1999
Mission: Impossible II," Pure John Woo C**p
","This movie was terrible.  The plot was laughable and extremely predictable. Woo's attempt to turn Tom Cruise into James Bond was a total mistake, as was his leaving any sort of suspense or plot twists out of the movie.  I mean, what is Mission Impossible (or any action movie) without a few moments where the story takes a sudden turn that you weren't expecting.  The constant slow motion, techno-drenched, swirly camera shots were ludicrous once you realized that most of the action was practically impossible or not nearly as exciting as Woo wanted you to think it was.  Woo's deal is that he tries to amaze you with his camera work in an attempt to divert your attention from the paper thin plot and characters.  And seriously, that gun just happened to be buried at his feet in the sand?  How creative.  To sum up, Mission Impossible 2 is a brainless pseudo-action movie which plods along in a series of slow motion shots and shallow love scenes before exploding into a horribly unrealistic  case study in idiocy.",3,0,0,5 June 2000
The Graduate," Incredibly complex, yet funny and moving
","I don't see why anyone would not like this movie.  Maybe they just weren't looking deep enough.  It perfectly portrays the pressures of finally 'growing up', and cutting all ties with your former life.  Hoffman's character experiences a rebirth (often symbolised by his swimming in the pool (or womb)) into 'manhood', although he can't figure out what that's supposed to be.  The incredible directing and camera work alone makes this movie a must, and even if one isn't looking for any deeper, artsy meaning they should find it incredibly entertaining.  The humor also, is ingenious. It is a movie where each time you watch it, you realize something new about it.  An incredible picture, I highly recommend it.",10,1,3,3 July 1999
The Thin Red Line," An incredible movie.
","Anyone who gave this movie a 1 is out of their minds.  I assume that most people would score this movie low because they did not understand it.  One person actually said to me, 'I don't like those Vietnam movies'.  Some Armegeddon fan type people are too eager or used to action to appreciate this masterpiece.  This is not your typical 'war' movie.  It does not attempt to be 'Saving Private Ryan.'  What it does do is explore man's inner being, and attempt to show what we all fear, love, or hate, and how we all are human, even if not all the same.  This movie was incredibly moving.  The artistic way in which it was directed may have turned off some 'mind in neutral' movie goers, but if you really just watch, you can learn about yourself, and your fellow man.  It shows that in the end, beneath the surface, we are all weak and unsure, and essentially alike.  So, if you didn't understand it totally, fine.  Just at least appreciate the beauty of the film.  This is one of the better films I have ever seen.",10,0,0,16 March 1999
