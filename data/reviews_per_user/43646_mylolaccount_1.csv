Iron Man 3," Cape - Superman, Superman - cape. Please meet.
","Terrible movie. Zod and his crew are the only ones I have empathy for here. They have a clear purpose at least. Humans are just reacting to external stimuli without ever having the means to change the outcome, so we can ignore them as insignificant in this scenario. And Clark... He has a cape. Really? He has a *ucking cape? For *ucks sake, what for? What purpose does it serve, other than making the whole thing look intensely moronic, I wonder? None really. Cape - Superman, Superman - cape. Please meet. You might not like each other but by God you are stuck together for all eternity and beyond. This movie takes the meaning of stupid to a whole new level.",3,0,1,19 October 2013
