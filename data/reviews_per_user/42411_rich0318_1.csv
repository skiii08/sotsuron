Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Geez People!
","I can't believe how many people rip this movie apart, yet it averages 7.0 out of 10 stars!  I'm not sure why people hate this movie.  If you're really into the story line of the original series, then you should be interested in how it all began.  If you just like a good story, then it fits into that category.  If you like special effects, this has that as well.  Yes, this movie has its weak points-Jar Jar and baby Anikan-but Ewan McGregor and Liam Neeson were excellent in their roles.  If there had never seen the original movies and this came out, it wouldn't get near the trashy reviews it gets here.  People expected way too much.  Even George Lucas said before the movie came out that people shouldn't expect too much - it's just a friggin' movie.",Null,1,2,30 November 2001
