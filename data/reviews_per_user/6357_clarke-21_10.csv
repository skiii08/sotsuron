The New World," Only Terrence Maick
","Terrence Malick is some kind of cinematic genius. He has a unique way of writing a story so that it coincides with the directing and cinematography.This movie is fantastic. Set design, cast and art direction. I was totally prepared to hate this movie when I rented it and saw the box.Turned out to be a surprise and an acting performance by Collin Ferrel that is not only tolerable, but strong. Christian Bale delivers here as well. Surprisingly, the only person who disappointed me here was Wes Dudi. Is he like the default Indian for every Native American movie? He didn't have an important role in the movie and didn't need to be in it.Add this to your Netflix rotation.",7,0,1,7 August 2008
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Writer talks about Star Wars movies influence, Joseph Campbell and new myth
","All, Like many of you, I'm a fan of Star Wars. Since I was born in 1977, I'm what you might call a Star Wars baby. At least that is what my mother told me. Star Wars has been a part of my life for years.Times have changed, but I remember feeling like the characters in Star Wars were friends who I was on a journey with. Do you know the feeling? Like, if I'm watching Empire Strikes Back, or if I happen to stumble onto it on some random channel, I have to immediately watch Return of the Jedi.A few years ago, while at dinner with friends. A cinematographer asked me what my greatest movie experience was. Without a doubt, Return of the Jedi's opening scene, where Darth Vader walks down the plank... I remember the audience's ovation.The movies were fun then. When Return of the Jedi was released, I remember Vader's opening scene and the long lines. The lines for Jedi where ridiculous.Like many of you, I was expecting to feel the same magic, when the last three movies were released. It didn't happen. I could be wrong, but I think the most exciting thing to happen in the Star Wars universe, within the last 15 years, has to be the Phantom Menace TRAILER. I remember downloading this trailer from Kazaa and hearing the audience going crazy. For a split second, when I watched the trailer back in 99, it was 1983 all over again.As the years have passed, I've grown attached to films with similar themes. The hero, who takes off on a journey and has a similar quest to Luke. A few years ago, I sought out the writer of another favorite film, The Last Dragon.The writer, Louis Venosta revealed to me, that Joseph Campbell's book, A Hero With a Thousand Faces, was an intricate part of his writing. I had never heard of Campbell until this time. I would learn that Campbell was the author who influenced Lucas. In fact, Campbell has said that Lucas was his greatest student.After reading several of Campbell's books and meeting with Venosta, I thought about writing the sequel to the Last Dragon, but then realized that I needed to write my own story.As a native New Yorker, and someone who could have lost his life during 9/11, I felt that a story needed to be made. A new myth. I finished writing my first book in 2008. Over the last few years, I couldn't figure out how to get the story out to the people who needed and wanted to read it.Like many of you, I hate all of the remakes. I was watching EMPIRE OF DREAMS, the documentary of the Star Wars films and I see a comparison between the time when Star Wars was made and the current state of affairs in the United States today. When I was selling my book on the streets of New York, a passerby told me that there weren't any new stories since the Matrix.The name of my book is MASTERNEVER AND THE FLOW OF DEATH. You can download the entire book by visiting www.masternever.com I've included an entire soundtrack that accompanies the book. I hope you will download and enjoy the book.I hope you don't mind me posting here. After writing a book and several screenplays, I want to connect with people who have similar interest. The rest of the Star Wars babies. Those waiting for a new myth.I'm also posting here, because IMDb played a vital role in starting this journey four years ago. So, I've come full circle.You can see me talking about this book, mythology and stories, but visiting this video.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBwDNDWirSs",Null,0,1,29 December 2010
Pan's Labyrinth," Good, but not great in terms of Fantasy movies
","Pan's Labyrinth is an good movie, but the problem that it has, when compared to other great fantasy movies is the amount of reality that is involved.There are two stories involved in this movie, and I while I won't discuss the nature of either, I will say that I'd prefer the movie to have a greater percentage of fantasy.Don't get me wrong, this is a really good movie and it is on the all time list of fantasy movies, but it has to much reality interwoven into the story.This movie could have been great if there was more character development and a greater percentage of the movie had dealt with the fantasy world involving the main character.",8,0,2,2 February 2007
Captain America: The First Avenger," Don't Believe The Hype
","I ventured into the theaters this evening expecting to see a decent film or at least the best adaptation of a comic. This is what I'd heard the last few days.Captain America is NOT the best comic book movie. It is a very average film with good special effects.To be totally honest, I don't think this film is better than Thor. Thor's writing was much better. Captain America is entertaining, but it lacks a certain element which would make it exciting.If you have not seen this, you can totally wait for the DVD. It isn't better than any of the Iron Man films, not better than Thor and it was just enough so the Avengers film would be made possible.",Null,19,45,24 July 2011
City of God," One of the best films ever made...may change your life
","This has to be one of the best movies I've ever seen. Fernando Meirelles gets credit for bringing this amazing story to life, after reading the novel written by Paulo Lins.This movie is amazing for several reasons. Many of which have nothing to do with directing. First, the music supervision is amazing. The score features some of the best classics, from Brazilian music. If you aren't a fan of this music, then this movie may make you one.The cinematography is breathtaking. César Charlone is rarely mentioned when this film is discussed, but he should and often. I've never seen a movie that has been shot like this.Bráulio Mantovani did the amazing job of creating a screenplay from the book. The book includes many characters which are not mentioned in the movie. I'd advise anyone who is interested in the book, to read it after they see the movie.The movie exposes you to both the beauty and the brutality that exist in the cities of Brazil.This movie is an experience.",10,2,5,27 December 2008
Drive," True Cinema
","For whatever reason, too many film makers have been concentrating on making movies that look and feel like reality. DRIVE feels like a film. One that makes you appreciate the movie experience. So many things are right about this film. The cinematography, music supervision and directing make this one of the best movies I've seen in years. There is an artistic quality evident. A quality that is lacking from most productions today. Initially, I had my reservations. I don't like to follow the crowd and other than word of mouth, I did not hear much about the film. Other than 'This is suppose to be good.'Initially, this film will conjure up images of some of the best movies based in Los Angeles. Michael Mann's HEAT and Harris's BOILING POINT. There is something about Los Angeles. As a photographer, I feel as though light is read differently in Los Angeles. You get hues and tones that you would not have access to, shooting in a place like New York City. The director, Refn, really displayed his creative talents here. The film editing was exceptional and immediately, Refn's style will conjure up images of Tarantino, but with dare I say, more experience. Ryan Gosling was solid, but it was Albert Brooks who really stole the show with an unforgettable performance. I'd be surprised if Brooks does not receive an Oscar nomination. This isn't a typical film. You'll have to watch this film twice to soak it up and really understand it. The music supervision and soundtrack is amazing. There is a retro feel you get while listening. In a world where film does not always equal cinema, this is an artistic masterpiece.",Null,2,5,1 October 2011
Super 8," Super Hype
","After being inundated with favorable reviews and comparison to E.T. and some of Spielberg's early work, I thought I was going to see a great movie.This movie is mediocre. Film students will love it because, technically, it is correct and so much was done right, but from a viewer perspective, this is not a great movie.What is this movie? Feels like Goonies, meets E.T and with a brief Close Encounter.This is a good movie, but you leave the theater feeling that you didn't get the full story. Not only that, but more character development was needed.This movie sucked. Not because it is bad. But because the marketing behind it made it greater than it was.If you have not seen this, you can wait for Netflix.",6,0,1,23 June 2011
There Will Be Blood," (spoiler) I drink your milkshake!
","You'll see mixed reviews on this movie. People have been griping about the music supervision and lack of closure at the end of the movie.This is definitely not a movie to see if you're depressed or recovering from a traumatic incident. You won't know how to feel when this is done.After seeing this movie for the second time, I have truthfully come to love Daniel Day Lewis as a villain. His performance in this movie was better than Gangs of New York and his character has one of the best lines in movie history, a line that will find its way into pop culture.'I drink your milkshake! I drink it up!'Excellent acting by Lewis and Paul Dano.",10,1,7,24 January 2008
