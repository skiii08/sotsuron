Mission: Impossible III," Some cool effects and scenes, but felicity was cooler than tom
","Who would have thought Felicity would overshadow tom? Oh wait, I guess that's a given. As much as I didn't plan on seeing the film, I got into a free screening, so I figured it wouldn't break my pact for not paying to see it. Anyway, Tom had some bi-polar moments, as one would expect by now, going from happy to sad, to happy, to crazy, to sad in about 6 seconds. But the scene near the beginning when he tosses the gun to Felicity (yes, i know its not her name in the movie) just had a cool effect and camera rotation, and she holds a gun well.The overall plot just seemed very shallow and less 'life-threatening' than the previous MI's. It jumped around a lot and just tried to employ as many effects as possible instead of trying to get you really into the story. Entrapement was better for the genre. Silent Hill had cooler effects for movies out now. Keep in mind, when I look at Tom, all I can think is 'crazy.'",3,2,4,5 May 2006
