Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Why?
","Star Wars: Episode I- The Phantom Menace is like watching a infant being slaughtered before your eyes. What was once a beautiful thing...now mutilated. Why George Lucas would release this horror upon the U.S. is still unknown, but one thing is certain, it shouldn't have happened. I purpose an immediate removal of all remaining prints to be seized and burned. This abomination of a movie deserves 2 stars if only because the 'acting' is comical. Seriously, I laughed my ass off watching this pile of garbage. It has to be more comical than any movie I've seen in the past couple years (Besides Star Wars Ep. 2-3...those were a riot!). Bottom Line: Don't watch this movie, yes, even you have some strange fascination about men with glowing sticks, avoid at all costs. It's a trap!",2,2,4,8 October 2007
30 Days of Night," How could you screw up what was laid out for you?
","30 Day's of Night sucked on so many levels, it's not even funny. Don't get me wrong, I loved the comics, but this movie was vile. Not in the good way either...The story was horrid. Even though the man behind the comics, Steve Niles, wrote the screenplay it couldn't have been farther from the original story line. There must have been two scenes, TWO SCENES, that were the same between the comics and movies. Why? The comics were practically story boards to what should have been done! And the comics were good, that's why they sold well. They shouldn't have strayed so far from the source material...The so called 'Special Effects' were bad. Really, Really, Really, bad. The CGI was so painfully obvious that it hurt. 30 Day's of Night is like watching a hyper-violent 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit'. One scene in particular sticks out. Eben and his ex-girlfriend (Who should be his wife if it followed the f#%king comics!) are driving in their car, when a 'Vampire' hops on the roof. The Animators were so lazy, that they didn't even give the vampire a face. It was just a shadow on their car. I've seen better animations in Pokemon.The acting, I didn't really have much hope for this seeing as Josh Harnett was cast in the lead. But, I will say he did a pretty good job as Eben. However, everybody else was vile. Nobody showed any emotion in their voice, none. It was like the Director hired his closest friends to do the job.Skip this movie at all costs. Maybe it's just because of my high expectations, but this movie ranks along with Uwe Boll's House of the Dead as one of the worst movies ever made. If you really, really, really, really, like vampires you might like it. Anyone else though, avoid like the plague.",1,3,11,11 November 2007
