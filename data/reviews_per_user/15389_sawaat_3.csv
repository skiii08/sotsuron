Raiders of the Lost Ark," One of the best films ever made
","I've known this film for about as long as I can remember, and the entire Indiana Jones trilogy for that matter. When I was a kid, all three of the movies were the same to me, but as I got older I realized that while the sequels do have their good moments (Not including Crystal Skull, yikes) there's really only one of the films that I personally believe still holds up to this day and is the best out of the trilogy. 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is exciting, inventive, humorous and classic. Harrison Ford offers a ruggedness and an undeniable charm to the character of Indiana. He's much more three dimensional than my 7 year old self remembers. He's not a perfect hero, he gets hurt, he stumbles and he makes mistakes, which in my opinion, makes the character even more appealing. Karen Allen plays Marion, who I think is the strongest female lead of the trilogy, and Karen was by far the best actress in the series. Not quite damsel in distress material as she proves throughout the film that she can hold her own, and she refuses to be bossed around. Part of what makes this film so fantastic is the details. Spielberg has a great attention to them and despite the film's enormous stature, I found it's the smaller things that make it the success that it is. Every shot is positioned beautifully, particularly in the opening temple sequence. That's not to say that the film's riveting chase sequences and heart-pumping action aren't notable as well. All the elements fall into place beautifully like a perfect jigsaw puzzle. There's little left to be desired and hardly a thing to complain about. If you have not seen this film already, please watch it! I guarantee you won't be disappointed. I'd say that spending a weekend marathoning through the trilogy would definitely be worth your time!",9,0,0,13 May 2014
The Matrix," My Favorite Movie Of All Time
","Visually entertaining, thought-provoking and extremely well executed. The Matrix has been on the top of my favorite films list for quite a few years. I've heard a lot of people say it hasn't aged well, and I have to strongly disagree and say that this movie was ahead of it's time, making now (2014) a perfect time to watch it! While it's sequels struggle to conduct a clear plot and fumbles around with countless loopholes in logic, the original film doesn't have a single story mistake (at least as far as I can think of!) and manages to follow through with intelligence and cleverness. Style! Did I mention this movie has style? In more ways than one. Not to mention a dozen pop culture references, a solid cast, and unforgettable special effects. The whole movie is laced with dialogue that becomes a brain game for the audience, forcing them to think and ponder about whether or not their own world is real or not. I know when I first watched it, I started to get a bit paranoid! The overall atmosphere of the film is one of awakening to your surroundings, the struggle between what people tell you to feel, and what you truly feel. Rebellion, the challenging of authority, being creative and the survival of human life. Overall, the film is basically one big action packed, mentally stimulating and gratifying present wrapped with a bow that is trying to say in the biggest way possible: You can do anything if you believe...'Don't think you are, know you are' - Morpheus",9,0,0,4 April 2014
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," A masterpiece of a sequel
","Have you ever loved something so much, that when you sat down to discuss what exactly it is about it that you adore, you could not find the words? That is how I feel about the Empire Strikes back: And I haven't a clue how I am going to express myself in less than 1000 words, but by god I will try.These days, it's tough to find a movie sequel that is worth watching. It's the kind of thing that causes critics and casual fans alike to roll their eyes and say: 'Really? Another one??' And it's true, sequels are usually the victims of poor script, less than decent acting and ugly visual effects.But don't lose hope my friends, if you are sick and tired of the sequels of the 21st century, I present to you Star Wars: The Empire strikes back (1980), directed by Irvin Kershner and written by Lawrence Kasdan. The sequel to the astronomically (haw) successful film 'Star Wars' (1977).Arguably the best Star Wars film ever made, and definitely one of THE best films ever made of the 20th century, TESB surprised and astounded audiences of all ages. Who knew it could get any better than blown up Death Stars and Garbage compactors? To begin, the film is relentlessly suspenseful right off the bat. Not even ten minutes in, and our main heroes are already in a spot of trouble. Something the last film accomplished but not to the same degree. And then, just when we think everyone is back together and all is well, a great snow battle ensues between the Rebel Alliance and the Galactic Empire. I would say that this is the jist of the plot of the film, but that's taking it way too lightly.What Kershner does so well is he takes the characters that you have grown to love and pits them up against their darkest, most sinister fears. Everyone is broken up, vulnerable, misguided and tortured (mentally and physically). And yet...the film can be quite humorous at times. While it does delve into deep, dark places, it never goes so far that you start to feel depressed with our heroes situation. It is still an extremely fun ride no matter which scene you're watching.One of the most enjoyable aspects of TESB is Frank Oz's incredible puppet Yoda, or rather, his incredible portrayal of Yoda, because at the end of the day, the little green creature is another character in the story. Now when I saw this film when I was younger, I of course believed that Yoda was a real thing. I didn't really know how movies were made back then. Now of course, seeing it through adult eyes, now I know how the film makers operated Yoda and brought him to life, but the whimsy is still there, he still feels completely real in every shot he is in. And I always feel like a kid again whenever he starts talking.The performances in ESB are so much better, no doubt because of the stronger script and stronger direction. Also that these actors have had three whole years to get to know their characters a bit better. Mark Hamill in particular, who may have rushed a few of his lines, or sounded maybe just a pitch too whiny in the previous film, has become such a grown character, not fully grown, but you can see a maturity there that simply didn't exist before. To Hamill's credit, he is also a big reason why we can believe the existence of the non-human characters such as R2-D2 and Master Yoda. Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher have perfect chemistry and none of their romantic scenes ever felt out of place.And lastly, although I have decided not to spoil anything, I will say that the ending to TESB is so incredibly unique and different to anything we have seen before, and we will never see anything like it again. The group is divided, characters have been injured, they aren't in the best of shape, but what do they do? They move on...they keep their optimism and hope. Their situation is not perfect, but they are able to find a small shimmer of light in the growing shadows. And that's what makes this film so incredibly moving, what a perfect lesson for movie goers of all age demographics. That no matter how hopeless a situation is, somewhere there is an answer.Therefore I give The Empire Strikes back a 10 out of 10. I struggled to find any faults with this movie, and was pleased that I could think of none. So I hope you go out and enjoy it as much as I have, and will continue to do so. May the force be with you!",10,1,2,27 November 2015
