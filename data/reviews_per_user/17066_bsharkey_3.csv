The Devil's Advocate," lawyers are evil, and this movie proves it.
","a pretty decent performance by Reeves (for once), and definitely by Pacino and the supporting cast.  a tad longer than i'll usually tolerate unless the story is really that involved, but it worked.  better than i expected, and one that really makes you think.",8,0,1,25 July 1999
Rudy," Notre Dame propaganda/recruiting film.
","watching this was like sitting through a 2 hour propaganda piece on Notre Dame (the university, and it's football).  thanks, but no thanks.  if i want to be subjected to such brainwashing, i'll watch Reefer Madness!  i gave it a '5'. go Trojans...",5,5,27,20 December 1998
There's Something About Mary," if you're not dying in the first 30 minutes, get up and leave!
","this movie killed!  one of those rare gems you actually think about going to see again (i never do this, but would make an exception).the thing about Something About Mary is that i was under the impression that i would know all the jokes from the trailers going into the movie -- boy was i wrong.  Not only were there 1000 other laughs that i didn't anticipate, the ones that were revealed in the previews were even funnier than i expected.if you haven't seen this yet, what are you waiting for?",8,1,1,19 September 1998
