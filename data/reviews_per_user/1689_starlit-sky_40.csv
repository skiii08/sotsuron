The King's Speech," The Best Movie of 2010 - Contender for Best Picture Oscar
","The King's Speech is, in my opinion, the best movie of 2010. It is the story of King VI's struggle with his speech impediment and his therapy sessions with Lionel Logue, a speech therapist with unorthodox methods.Colin Firth is amazing as King VI. I have never been a huge fan but in this movie he just raises the bar to whole another level. Characters with impediments are quite common (Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man, Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump, Daniel Day-Lewis in My Left Foot) but Colin Firth's portrayal is truly unique and stands on its own. Geoffrey Rush is also magnificent and his talent shines with all its glory. He makes it look so effortless and yet the expressions he portrays in the movie are so subtle. I think both Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush deserve an Oscar. They have great chemistry.Story is very intriguing as it is based upon the true story of King VI who was suffering from speech impediment which prevented him from pursuing the crown or even wanting to pursue the crown. What makes this story different from the other movies with challenged characters is that at the end ****SPOILER***** the character makes a break through and turns into a different person.Screenplay is very well written and should be nominated for Best Original Screenplay as it is not based on previously released material. Costumes, art direction and the score are equally impressive and well-done. I also liked the cinematography and wide-lens shots. There is one particular scene where King and Lionel are talking and Lionel stops to fall behind and the camera is focused on King where the image of Lionel in the background becomes blurry creating a sense of isolation.If you like drama movies with historical context, great acting which will inspire you, you will surely enjoy King's Speech.",9,0,1,21 January 2011
Training Day," An Excellent Cop/Action Movie
","Young police officer Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) tries to prove himself to a senior cop, Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington), to be admitted into his narcotic unit in LAPD in his first day. The whole story takes place in just one day but what a day that is! From the beginning to the end, they witness all kinds of criminal events as they cruise down the back streets of Los Angeles. Jake is a straight arrow and completely honest, yet equally naïve. Throughout the day, he desperately tries to handle the situations he encounters in his own naïve way whereas Alonzo, who is much more experienced in the field, has completely different methods of resolving issues. As a result, they often disagree over how each situation should be handled and Jake realizes that his views are mostly in conflict with those of his senior officer. However, since his objective is to get into narcotics department and since the only way is to impress Alonzo, Jake obeys Alonzo's orders. After all, Alonzo is the expert in the field so he should know better.
The best thing about the movie is that it keeps the audience guessing right till the end about the actual morality of Alonzo. Is he really a corrupt police officer as inexperienced Jake suspects him to be or are his ways really how things are handled in the narcotics department of LAPD? Neither the audience nor Jake really knows the answer to that question for it is Jake's (and also our) first day in that field. Who are we or who is Jake to judge Alonzo's morality who spent many years in this field? Can we really say for sure that his methods are not practised in reality? After every argument, when Jake tries to rest his case, Alonzo comes back with a stronger argument and convinces him that his methods are the best. Of course, you don't know the answers to these questions until the end unless you haven't read the complete plotline. I honestly think whoever is responsible with the publicity of this movie doesn't know anything about the art of movie making. The same goes for the person who is responsible with the plotline which gives away everything about the movie. If you haven't seen this movie yet, do yourself a favor: DO NOT READ ANY reviews (especially the plotline in the 'Main Details' page) which give away the whole story. Possible Oscar Nominations: Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke both deserve Oscar nominations (Best Leading/Supporting Actor) for their excellent performances. Antoine Fuqua has done a very nice job as a director by capturing the ambience on the streets and with his depiction of criminals' lives, especially of those in the black neighbourhood. Each scene is nicely done and the suspense is so authentic. I was especially impressed by the tension in the scene where Jake sits down at the poker table with the guys waiting for Alonzo to come back. You can find a similar tension maybe in a horror movie.What I didn't like (***POSSIBLE SPOILERS***): I didn't like the publicity of this movie where Denzel Washington was openly declared to portray a corrupted cop which probably is the biggest movie spoiler that I have ever encountered in my life. The best part of the movie is the puzzle it creates over Alonzo's real character because it is not possible for the audience to decide whether or not issues are handled in Alonzo's ways in special narcotic division. Given his real character away is to kill the joy of the entire movie. Even at the end of their day, during their conversation in the car, Alonzo's explanation is very convincing and makes perfect sense. Only thing I didn't like about the movie itself is the scene where Jake jumps from the terrace of the building to the Alonzo's car after beaten up pretty badly. This scene was not realistic.",8,1,11,17 December 2001
Memento," The Most Original Movie Of The Year So Far
","Memento, for one thing, is a very ORIGINAL movie. It is impressive how the story is told which makes it so original. It is quite astonishing to see such an innovative method of story telling after all these years of movie making. The movie just makes you believe that there is no end of human creativity and imagination.Story is told backwards from the perspective of the protagonist who cannot remember what happened 30 seconds before due to an incident in which his wife was raped and killed. The story of the movie is his attempts to find his wife's killer. It is very interesting to watch the story going backwards. The director, in my opinion, makes a flawless job of telling the story backwards; it is just ingenious. The success of the movie is mostly based on the screenplay, which is written very cleverly. In each scene, you see what happened before and try to make a connection to what you saw in the previous scene, which, in fact, comes afterwards in real time. As you reach the end of the movie, you come to know the reasons that triggered the events in the beginning, I mean at the end. The most important elements in the story telling are the writings on the protagonist's body, notes at the back of the pictures he takes in order to remember the characters and the little notes he writes on papers. As the movie goes on, you see when and for what reason he took the notes on the back of the pictures and tattooed some of them on his body. The movie also kind of makes you ask the question whether one can rely on the notes he takes as the incidents happen and whether one can rely on these notes' corresponding to the true incidents in reality. Protagonist claims that he can, answering, 'yes' to that question but I thought the otherwise. This is not a easy movie to understand. I am going to rent it when it comes out because there are some things that I didn't understand. In the end, like me, you may find yourself asking whether there was a character named Sammy in reality, who killed his wife, what was his real job or even who was Teddy. But these questions don't take any excitement from the movie. This is a very, very good movie. I strongly believe that this movie deserves at least a couple of Oscar nominations (I know there are probably very good productions to come before the year), including 'The Best Original Screenplay', 'Best Director' or even 'Best Editing'.",10,0,1,17 June 2001
The Others," So you thought 'The Sixth Sense' was good! This movie will put you in a coma!
","'The Others' is an extraordinary psychological thriller, full of suspense, frightening scenes and surprises that are guaranteed to blow your mind. Honestly, I never thought that they could make a better ghost movie than the 'The Sixth Sense'. I was thinking, 'why bother making another ghost movie while there isn't much left you could possibly add? It has been done already!' I couldn't possibly be more wrong. It begins like an ordinary ghost movie but it develops into something purely unimaginable to the point of making 'The Sixth Sense' look like 'Sound Of Music'! I assure you that 'The others' will become a classic in a short time and be a HUGE SUCCESS. This is an extraordinary movie, a magnificent cinematic achievement. Its suspense excels any other movie I have seen (except maybe 'Alien' and 'Silence Of The Lambs'). This movie is EVEN better than 'Jacob's Ladder' and 'The Sixth Sense'Why is it better than 'The Sixth Sense'? 1) It has a better plot that keeps you at the edge of your seat -at times while it doesn't make you jump out of it. 2) There are more suspenseful scenes and they are MUCH scarier than the ones in 'The Sixth Sense'. In fact, the scenes are so scary that they make audience LITERALLY jump out of their seats! 3) It also has more surprises (In 'The Sixth Sense', there was only one big surprise at the end). 4) It also has more characters that make the plot more sophisticated whereas 'The Sixth Sense' had only two main characters (or maybe three, including the mother). 5) It keeps you guessing right to the end and the pay off is quite magnificent. 6) The camera and sound effects are used in much superior and advanced ways. The scenes are shot from a perfect angle in such a masterful way; they actually add more tension to the already suspenseful situation. You could almost hear the whispers of ghosts as if they were whispering in your ear. Even when those ghostly sounds overlap with the sounds made by the characters in the movie, there is a sensible distinction that creeps you out. 7) The location of the story is also much more perfect for such a story than in 'The Sixth Sense'. The whole house itself, its interior designs, and its massiveness gives you the creeps. What I didn't like about the movie: You may find some inconsistencies if you think how the elements of the material world can share the same platform with the otherworldly, but there is no infallible way to overcome this in a ghost theme anyway. I loved the movie in its entirety. The Best Scene Of The Movie: The scene where Nicole Kidman faces The Others at the end of the movie. Line of the movie: 'Sometimes the world of the dead gets mixed up with the world of the living.' spoken by the nanny, Mrs Mills. Possible Academy Awards Nominations: 1) Best Screenplay, 2) Best Sound, 3) Best Sound Effects, 4) Best Performance by a leading Actress (Nicole Kidman) and in my opinion, 5) The Best Picture. You will like this movie if you like: The Sixth Sense, Jacob's Ladder, and other movies with ghost theme.

The Prestige," This movie has the pledge, the turn and the prestige
","This is a movie about two rival illusionists, Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale), who try to outdo each other's tricks and prove to be the better one. And while they are trying to learn the secrets of each others' tricks, they also sabotage each other's shows. One day, Alfred invents a trick that seems to deny the laws of physics (but after all, this is magic and all magic tricks seem to deny the laws of physics). Robert sets his mind to figuring out Alfred's trick and improving it so he can come out as the better magician. His journey to understanding Alfred's trick takes Robert to the US where he meets a scientist who seems to have found a way to manipulate electrical energy at a whole new level. He invests his money in a machine that can perform real magic (something all illusionists claim to do but only wizards can do).The movie begins with Alfred being accused of murdering Robert (while Robert was performing his magic with that electrical machine) and sentenced to death penalty. Since they are known to have sabotaged each other's shows, people take this to be one of those incidents that just ended up deadly for Robert. As Alfred is in jail, he gets Robert's journal and begins reading it. From this moment on, the movie moves backward in time and we get to see how the feud between the two magicians initially began and the events leading up to the Robert's death. The movie doesn't follow a straight time line and can be a little confusing at times. With Alfred's reading Robert's journal in where Robert speaks of reading Alfred's notes, sometimes it is hard to know where we are at the story.Overall, I think the Prestige is a pretty good movie and I must add that it owes much of its success to directing skills of Christopher Nolan. The way he tells the story piece by piece as he pulls them from different places and times can easily go wrong but he is very good at doing that. I also liked the unknown element in the movie. There were some simple explanations to the seemingly magical tricks and there were also some unknown, sci-fi elements.",10,0,1,29 October 2006
The Terminator," One of the Greatest Modern Science Fiction Movies
","It's not easy to write a review about a movie I have seen 27 years ago. This movie is quarter-century old. It's a great combination of action, science-fiction, mystery and romance. Fundementally, it is based upon a futuristic science fiction idea.The present time story begins with two guys appearing out of of thin air, searching for Sarah O'Connor. One of them is a tough guy, full of muscles, who seems to kill anybody on his way without any hesitation or remorse. The other is a mild character with somewhat more delicate features.As the story unfolds, you realize each character has his own agenda about Sarah O'Connor. One of them is protective of Sarah while the other is trying to terminate her - hence The Terminator.Why The Terminator is trying to kill Sarah is the mystery of the movie. It ties to the introduction in the beginning of the movie when we are given a glimpse of the future when mankind are battling with the machines for their survival.Overall, Terminator is a great motion picture, a combination of familiar sci-fi elements put together in an original script packed with entertaining action sequences. Arnold is perfect for this role. Its almost as if the role has been written for him. Its success has been confirmed by later sequels (T2 Judgment Day, Terminator 3 The Rise of the Machines, and Terminator Salvation).",10,1,1,20 January 2011
Cloverfield," Blairwitch Meets Godzilla Meets War of the Worlds
","Most simply put, this movie is a combination of Blair Witch, War of the Worlds and Godzilla. It begins with the familiar concept (which is starting to become cliché) that the following events actually happened and video tapes were discovered. Then the audience start to watch the video tapes which are shot in the hand-held camera style (again, Blair Witch style). New York city is under attack but we don't get to see the attackers, this unknown element does bring some suspense to the story. Then we discover *spoiler* that it is a gigantic creature (kind of like Godzilla) from outer space that is attacking the city. That, in a nutshell, sums up the movie. Even though I didn't get bored and watched until the end, I don't think the movie offers anything original other than bringing good ideas from the past movies into one plot. Special effects look more impressive on film shot with hand-held camera style. This is the best part of the movie. Story is very basic and like I said nothing new about it. The movie deserves a rating between 6-6.5 .",6,1,2,22 August 2010
Crash," Movie about racism and good and bad in people
","In a society where everyone has racist inclinations, everybody's path is bound to collide with each other, especially in a racially diverse city like LA. The movie has a very strong message but I am not so impressed by the way the message is delivered. The plot seems to me to be a little too contrived. The structure of the plot is similar to 'Traffic' where there are different group of characters each living in their own world and their paths cross each other unexpectedly. It seems every character has an issue with a certain race. One cop doesn't like blacks and harasses a black woman in front of her husband, two other black guys don't like white people, and harass a white couple and steal their van, some middle eastern guy's store is broken into and he blames a black guy, some Chinese guy hates some other race (I cannot remember, there were too many hating going on). It's like a contest of hatred (whoever hates the most number of races wins!). The message is serious but I think some of the dialogs are just overdone. They are way too direct and not subtle enough. We get it, these people are racist and racism is a bad thing. We get it, we get it. The way the characters behave is just too over-the-top. The story and unfolding of the events are enough to give us an idea of what's going on in their heads, do we really need to hear every little racist thought they are thinking? I am also not so pleased with the way every group of character crosses path with the other - so many coincidences. I know the title is 'Crash' and it is part of the movie's message: people colliding with each other. But again, some coincidences come off as contrivances (so long I don't read the screenplay writer's thoughts, I am OK with it but when I can read them, then to me they are contrived for a purpose and that takes away from the movie). Overall, not a bad movie but not good enough to win an Oscar.",6,3,7,14 October 2006
The Town," The Town is a successful crime thriller
","The Town is a crime thriller about a team of bank robbers in Boston area. The story centers around 3 main characters, Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck), Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) and James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner). Doug and James are professional bank robbers but they are opposite characters. Doug, even though a criminal, is portrayed as a likable, charming character. We see more of his positive qualities: he refrains from harming other people. Doug, on the other hand, is a truly corrupt character who enjoys hurting other people.A lot of people point out the similarities between The Town and Heat and claim The Town is an imitation of Heat. Although there are some similarities I think this is inevitable since both movies are about a team of bank robbers and there will be bank robbery, shoot-out and car chase scenes and a romantic love affair always adds a flavor to stories. I actually liked The Town better than Heat. I thought Heat was too long; the story was drawn-out needlessly which ruined its pace and took away from the action. The Town, on the other hand, focuses more on the action. I also think action scenes in The Town are better and more suspenseful.If you like crime thrillers, you should definitely check this one out. You will find The Town is a decent, well-directed, entertaining movie.",8,1,3,25 October 2010
The Bourne Identity," My name is Bourne, Jason Bourne
","The Bourne Identity is the first movie of a very successful trilogy. The movie begins with a body floating in water off the coast of France, pulled into a boat. Soon we learn he is not an ordinary person. There is something mysterious about him. He is suffering from memory loss and doesn't remember anything about his own identity. On top of that, there are dark characters lurking at every corner that are chasing after him. As the story unfolds, we get to find out more about him but there is still a good amount of unknown facts that maintain the suspense and mystery. This is a very well-made movie with a very well written screenplay, amazing action scenes (the car chase scene is just amazing) that will keep you at the edge of your seat until the end. Jason Bourne, like James Bond, is a spy and this is a spy movie but in many ways there are major differences which make The Bourne Identity quiet special. Most James Bond movies are one-dimensional in the sense that James Bond is the good guy and everybody he is eliminating are the bad guys. Jason Bourne, on the other hand, is multi-dimensional because he is constantly re-defining himself (and that goes throughout the entire trilogy) and the movie is not really drawing a clear picture if he is the bad guy or the good guy. This ambiguity is possible due to his amnesiac condition. For all we know, he may have been a bad guy before his accident but now he is defining himself with his current actions. This ambiguity creates a mystery around him. And the mystery is thickened through the identity of the people who are trying to eliminate him, mainly Conklin (Chris Cooper) who is running the Treadstone project (more about Treadstone in later movies). The conflict between Jason Bourne and Conklin, and Bourne's turning against the people who gave him the assignment adds a whole another dimension to the movie which is not seen in James Bond movies. I must say that The Bourne Identity is probably the best movie of its kind. It doesn't fall into known clichés, unrealistic action scenes, explosions, hero doesn't display any super powers, no special effects, no silly plot twists and turns or plot holes, all of which we are accustomed to see in average Hollywood production. Highly recommended.",10,2,2,7 September 2010
American Psycho," Not A Good Movie
","American Psycho contains so many elements, it is so hard to categorize it. Yes, there are some erotic scenes but I would not call it erotic, there is violence and blood but I would not call it scary, there are some funny moments but I again would not call it funny. Now you may say 'do we have to categorize it?' Of course, not. But all those elements are so disconnected from one another that they seem out of place. A good-looking killer without a motive. And I still do not know why I was not scared even a bit by the murder scenes. He likes 80s music specially Phil Collins, Huey Lewis and the news. Unfortunately, all these things fail to come together to make meaningful whole. Was the purpose of the movie to create an irony by trying to make a picture with all these irrelevant traits? And what about the final? What conclusion was I supposed to draw from the last conversation he had with his attorney? Did I miss something? Not a good movie.",5,3,11,7 August 2000
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," A Sequel that Measures Up to the First Movie
","Imagine a sequel that is almost as good as the first original movie, or even better. That's not very easy to do. Most sequels are terrible, made only to bank on the original movie's ideas without introducing anything new.T2 Judgment Day is not an original movie because of its plot, or its idea but it is actually groundbreaking in terms of special effects. I do not like movies that rely on special effects alone for its appeal. There must be more to a movie than just special effects. And T2 delivers it.T2 is a special movie: This is, I believe, the first time CGI was used. Prior to T2, you could easily make out the image that was pasted to the film. The graphic image would stick out like a sore thumb, its contour easily traceable by naked eye.With T2, CGI (computer generated imagery) technique has evolved to such a level that creating any image and adding it to the film became possible. And this is done so well, there is really no way of telling it apart from the original film like you could do in movies prior to T2. Contour lines are no longer visible, they are much smoother and blend with the original film.As for the story, it is almost the repeat to the original movie and there are many parallel scenes. Again two characters fighting each other for the fate of Sarah O'Connor, wait, this time for John O'Connor (Sarah's son); that is one main difference. So we have a new character added to the story. We have a more sophisticated terminator, T1000, the indestructible liquid man - thanks to CGI effects. We get to see the character who is responsible for building the micro-processor that gave birth to SKYNET, the evil mainframe that declared war on humanity.One thing I would like to emphasize is the performance of Robert Patrick, the actor who portrays T1000. His acting is simply fascinating and, in my opinion, is the reason why this movie works so well. A lot of the people are impresses by the CGI, rightfully so, and forget to give credit where its due. Robert Patrick brought T1000 alive. Without his impeccable performance, the movie would fall flat, even CGI couldn't save the movie. His brute looks, his robotic but finely-tuned moves, his cunning ways were just what this movie needed.After T2, there were two more franchise movies, T3-The Rise of the Machines and Terminator Salvation.",9,4,5,20 January 2011
The Exorcist," Exorcist comes back after 27 years to haunt us again!
","Exorcist, a movie which is nearly 27 years old, has come back to haunt us again! And it seems people who see it for the very first time seem to be as much shocked as the viewers who saw it in the early 70s.
Exorcist, I believe in many ways, is a good horror story. First a little girl's soul being taken over by devil is quite original in its own terms. Innocence falling victim to evil forces. The screenplay, based upon that theme, is quite terrifying. However, there are some parts I have to criticize: 1) There are some scenes in the movie that are left out of context. For instance, the scene in the church where it is showing the statue of Virgin Mary having being tampered with. This scene lasts only about 2-3 seconds and is out of context. Who has done it? And why? Is it the devil? Isn't devil busy taking over Regan's soul? 2) Now here what bothers me most about this classical horror picture: After they tie Regan to bed, she totally transforms from a human being into a demon. I mean she looks just like a demon; she doesn't look anything like a human being. Her eyes, her face, her voice, I mean she totally becomes a demon-like creature. What I don't understand is that they still treat her like as if she is a sick person. I mean try to recall the reactions of the characters that witness a transformation of a man into a werewolf standing next to them. Do they get scared and run away, feeling the presence of an evil being or do they try to speak to the newly transformed creature as if he is the same being. The girl is completely gone, there is almost nothing left of her but they insist to speak to her as if she is still conscious. The way doctors look at her after all that transformation is utterly ridiculous. They seem barely in shock. It is a demon they are looking at!!! But they look as if it is normal, like something they see everyday! Instead they should be more shocked, more scared, more in the awareness of the fact that the being they are dealing with is not a girl anymore, it is a demon. My guess is that, in the original screenplay, the transformation she goes through is not very outstanding, not very conspicuous; she preserves 75% of her original looks, and that's why all the other characters around her treat her as if she is really sick. But when they were shooting the movie they must have gone way too far than what is in the original script in terms of creating her looks. There is no way, anyone can perceive that being as a sick little girl, it is a demon-creature. That is, I think is the mistake, which is bothering me most.What I like most about the movie? The performance of the mother is just amazing. And the unforgettable score, 'Tubular Bells' by Mike Oldfield. Here's another criticism: They don't play that score often enough; they should have played it more often. And what about the 11 minute restored parts? I have seen this movie years ago so I am not sure but I guess the only additions are the sudden flashes of devil's image in background, in the dark and the image of devil's statute on the wall of Regan's bedroom. My personal feeling is that these scenes are either totally new or restored because I don't remember seeing them when I have first seen the movie.",10,0,1,27 September 2000
Pearl Harbor," Where are the Kamikazes?
","Finally, highly awaited and overly promoted Pearl Harbor opened at theaters across the world. like to review this movie 1) on itself and 2) in comparison to Michael Bay's other movie, Armageddon, and I have two major critiques coming out of each review.1) Firstly, I was so surprised that there was NOT even one scene of a kamikaze diving into a battle ship despite the fact that kamikaze attacks are the most important element of Pearl Harbor story. So why were there NO kamikaze scenes? We all have seen historical movies where the history is told inaccurately due to lack of knowledge or events twisted on purpose but never had I seen a movie where the most important element is disregarded all together with no plausible reason. How can you make a Pearl Harbor movie without Kamikazes?2) My second critique is based upon the incredible similarities between Pearl Harbor and Armageddon. Here are the ones I have noticed: 1) In both movies, the first hour and 20 minutes is filled with comical incidents and easy-laughter type of jokes. Remember The Armageddon where Bruce Willis' crew was being tested for their space mission? Do you remember the funny incidents that take place during these tests? In Pearl Harbour, it is exactly the same; funny things happen when the pilots are tested for -not for space mission but this time for- war. In both movies, we see that the first half of the story is senseless comedy which somehow spoils the wholeness of the movie to the point of making it look like two separate movies. Some may argue that it is a artistic achievement to combine two parts but I think if they are so separate in nature they should not be combined at all because that makes the whole picture look incongruous. If you are going to make a comedy, you should continue with the same pace and told the story from that point of view. If you are going to make a serious war movie then you should be very careful with the degree of comedy involved. 2) In both movies, a guy is leaving a girl behind for his duty. In fact, it is the same guy, Ben Affleck. He was leaving Liv Tyler behind in Armageddon promising to come back where he does exactly the same in Pearl Harbor. There were romantic scenes before he left for the mission; in Pearl Harbor, again, there is romance all though this time scenes were less sensual. 3) In both movies, there was a aftermath which was filled with tragedy. In Armageddon, Bruce Willis had to stay and sacrifice his own life whereas in Pearl Harbor Ben Affleck's friend gets killed in fight with Japanese and Ben Affleck returns as the sole survivor in both movies.Briefly, I think Pearl Harbor is suffering from a lack of story. It is simply filled with easy comedy, romance and special effects which are told in such an expected and in such an average way, it takes away the whole excitement. A good movie needs more than that.",2,0,0,17 June 2001
Saving Private Ryan," Most shockingly realistic battle scenes ever made in a war movie
","If you love war movies, Saving Private Ryan should be your favorite. The battle scenes at Normandy are outrageously shocking and realistic and it's beyond anything movie audience around the world has ever experienced before. Steven Spielberg's genius shines once again. His hand-held camera style makes you feel like you are actually there on the battlefield, in the middle of it all, bullets whizzing by, rockets exploding, soldiers dying in great numbers, as they are shred to pieces with all the heavy artillery raining down on them. It is quite breathtaking and also saddening. It is a story of a team of soldiers on a mission to save one Private, namely Ryan. Ryan is the last son of a family who already lost 4 of their sons to war. So the powers that be decide to do something nice for the mother and launches the mission: Saving Private Ryan. Rest is history. This movie took the war movies to a different level. Strongly recommended.",10,1,2,3 September 2010
Transformers," a typical Michael Bay movie
","Too much action and not enough character or story development. Michael Bay seems to think that if he shoots impressive action sequences (like he did in Pearl Harbour for example) then he thinks the movie will work. But it doesn't. Typically, his movies begin with people trying to connect sexually-there is always some reference to that (this is almost traditional - see Armageddon and Pearl Harbour). I can tell that almost every Michael Bay movie will have some sort of love/romance in the beginning. OK, it is a big part of life but the way Michael Bay presents it is so typically Hollywoodish and unoriginal. I don't like the way filmmakers throw romance in every movie nowadays. It seems they feel like they have to include romance as if it is an obligation. That's why, it feels completely unnatural and unconvincing. Same comments apply to the humor in the movie (so cliché and predictable). I haven't seen the Transformers cartoon or read the comic book so I cannot comment on that but this movie seemed to me unoriginal and poorly constructed piece of cinema without any real value except for visual effects, which is why I gave 4 out of 10.",4,0,3,20 July 2007
Million Dollar Baby," overrated movie which is predictable after the 2nd act.
","I must say that I am really disappointed that this movie got the best picture Oscar. It starts as a promising movie, the opening act is wonderful. Maggie (Hilary Swank) is a young adult woman who is trying to be a professional boxer asking help from an old, experienced boxing coach Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood). Eddie (Morgan Freeman) is Frankie's right-hand and possibly the only one who really understands him. Frankie is haunted by guilt about something happened between him and his daughter in the past and he is reluctant to coach Maggie. But Maggie has been through many hardships and is not a quitter. She is determined to get where she wants and she is willing to do what others are not (actually this is from a sign in the gym they are working out: winners are willing to do what loser are not). Soon enough, she wins Frankie's heart and Frankie finally warms up to the idea of coaching a female boxer. Maggie, in a way, could be thought of as a 'female Rocky' as she, too, is an underdog, someone who is poor, had many hardships but willing to fight until the end (only, unlike Rocky, it's a she). Then the championship games begin and after the 1st act is over, the movie takes a tumble. From then on, everything is downhill and very predictable. I can honestly say that I knew everything that was going to happen in the last 45 minutes of the movie. I could have walked out the theatre and wouldn't have missed a thing. Because everything that happened in the last act was just predictable. There was no room in the story for any improvement. It's like the plot has been decapacitated. It was very painful to watch. I felt all the buttons that the director was trying to push to activate emotions. They were just too obvious and in our face. Overall, this is not a bad movie but not good enough to win an Oscar.",7,1,4,14 October 2006
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Here comes the disappointment from Tarantino
","Kill Bill Vol. 1Quentin Tarantino's 4th film, Kill Bill, is a story of revenge that is quite stylistic in terms of fighting scenes but lacks a story that stirs up the emotions of revenge in the audience. It starts with a Klingon proverb from the movie, Star Trek II, The Wrath of Khan: `The revenge is a dish best served cold' The movie doesn't waste time heating things up. First, we get a glimpse of Umma Thurman's character severely beaten face, a sound of shotgun (which supposedly should have blown her head off) and we skip to the part where Umma's character starts to take revenge from the people who did her wrong. As we go along, we are introduced to the characters of Deadly Viper Assassination Squad through flashbacks.This kind of backward storytelling, where we start from the end and gradually move back in time through flashbacks may work for other themes. Sadly, it doesn't work for a movie about revenge. By the time,  we get to know what has gone wrong between characters, the revenge part has already taken place and the movie is over. When we are watching Umma's character killing her enemies, we do not feel anything. I admit that every scene is very stylish, especially the fighting scenes. However, without establishing any familiarity towards the characters, the scenes are simply unable to create any emotion. This, I found to be the biggest problem with Kill Bill Vol 1. One might say that the real revenge will take place between Urma's character (Black Mamba) and Bill later, in the Volume 2, and by the time we get to see that happen we will have been acquinted with every little detail about the events that led to it. Even if this is true, the Kill Bill Volume 1 would remain to be a movie where an unknown character is taking revenge from her unknown assailants from the past. The fact still remains: we do not know enough about either Urma or her assailants to feel the slightest emotion for either one of them.Quentin Tarantino was apparently influenced by the old time Chinese Kung-Fu movies and wanted to make a movie where he pays his due respect to those old classics that led him to directing movies in the first place. He does add his own style and humor to what is already a well-established, a distinctive genre of film-making. Nevertheless, a movie where you know so little about the characters is doomed for failure. If you are interested in seeing a very-well shot martial arts movie (Kung-Fu combats and sword-fight scenes) embellished with super neat camera angles, choreography, music and editing, then Kill Bill might be just your movie. If you are expecting more than that, then it will probably disappoint you. If you want to watch a good revenge movie, I would simply recommend First Blood/Rambo. You will find yourself take side with Rambo against the evil small town cop. And when Rambo kicks ass, you will cheer for him as hero and take pleasure in the pain of his enemy, something you will not experience in Kill Bill Vol 1.",8,0,0,15 October 2003
Paranormal Activity," Entertaining but not original
","Paranormal Activity is a well-executed and entertaining film however it is not entirely original. It is the story of a couple who suspect there might be an evil spirit haunting their house. They decide to film the paranormal activity by using a hand-held camera. I have seen many movies about houses haunted by spirits but not one that is shot by hand-held camera in an amateur style. This makes the movie somewhat believable. But other than this idea, the film falls short of offering anything original. It has some scary moments and the suspense builds up nicely but when you get to the ending it feels like 'Blair Witch Project' in the house. If you like ghost stories and haunted houses, I recommend my favorite movie of the genre, 'The Others'.",7,0,7,19 October 2009
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," An intelligent movie with wisdom on romance
","Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a rare movie with an intelligent script that studies the pain of romantic relationships and breakups. It's quite philosophical and requires thinking. The editing and storytelling styles are unusual which could be challenging to some viewers.In order to understand some of the philosophical ideas behind the script, one needs to be familiar with existentialist philosophy and the ideas of German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche who pioneered existentialist philosophy. Nietzsche believed that pain is essential to human experience. People should not numb their pain. Instead people should use their pain to cultivate their character. He likened the pain to the roots of a plant; the deeper they go, stronger the plant will be. In short, pain builds character.The other concept of Nietszche that stood out to me in the screenplay is the eternal recurrence of events. Nietzsche suggested that events in the universe could be repeating themselves in endless cycle which he called 'eternal recurrence'. Charlie Kaufman probably named the title of the screenplay after this concept. We all know that he knows about Nietzsche as he is quoted a couple of times in the movie (the lines from 'Beyond Good and Evil).The other existentialist concept is the world is what you make of it. It is how you see it and it matters more how you see it than it being an independent reality. If someone erases you from their memory, that doesn't take anything away from the goodness of memories themselves. If they mean so much to you and still a part of you then that's all it matters. Well enough with the philosophy...This is the story of romantic couple, Clementine (Kate Winslet) and Joel (Jim Carrey), who go through a breakup. Joel finds out that Clementine had a procedure done to erase all memories of him and their relationship. He decides to go through the same procedure and remove her from his memory. However, during the procedure he comes to a realization. This realization is the wisdom of the movie. It offers a great message inspired by the aforementioned philosophical ideas.I think Eternal Sunshine is a great movie and a rare cinematic art. If you love literature, philosophy and intelligent film-making, the chances are you will like Eternal Sunshine.",10,1,2,20 March 2011
Avatar," Visually groundbreaking but story falls short at the end
","Visually, Avatar is probably the most stylish and groundbreaking film in the history of cinema. Its use of CGIs and visual effects are truly at whole another level from everything else I have seen. This technique may be the first of its kind. This a science fiction/war story with strong dramatic elements. Humans are colonizing another planet due to its rich resources and they engage in a battle with the planet local inhabitants (the blue creatures). At the end, it is a classic battle between strong evil enemy and the less powerful, good guys. I think the ending was contrived and unrealistic. Something about it just didn't feel right. I think it could have been written better, more intelligently, but it felt as if they wanted to bank on the visuals so they stretched the story to include more action scenes which, in my opinion, is the only downfall of this movie. I still think it should have won the best picture (instead of The Hurt Locker).",8,2,4,3 September 2010
Saw," I want to play a game!
","Two men wake up in an isolated room only to find themselves chained by their feet to walls from a distance from each other. Neither of them have any idea where they are, how they got there or who might have kidnapped them. Soon they discover clues as to what they need to do to survive this sick test, designed by a maniac who is referred to as the 'Jigsaw'.Saw grasps you from its very first moment until the end. The idea that a killer designing traps in where he places people so they will end up either killing themselves or escape with serious bodily injuries is quite horrifying. And yet, it still has a message: Jigsaw is trying to teach his victims the value of life. The story is structured very well. As two men (Adam and Dr. Gordon) start talking to each other they discover certain connections between each other and their relation to the Jigsaw. The story is two-fold, past and present: we go back in time to see the victims' past connections and we also see them co-operating to get of the situation they are presently in. But all those connections are revealed gradually serving very well to the building suspense.As you might expect, there are some gruesome scenes in the movie but they are not gratuitous. Even though we are used to seeing some many twists at the end (it seems ever since 'The Sixth Sense', every thriller/suspense movie must have a surprise ending), SAW still manages to surprise us at the end with a shocking ending. I highly recommend it to all horror fans.",10,0,1,9 October 2006
From Hell," Each scene is stylish but the movie lacks soul
","From Hell is the story of Jack The Ripper, an infamous serial killer who committed his crimes in the late 19th century London. He is allegedly the first serial killer who killed his victims with sexually related desires. The movie is based upon the comic book by Alan Moore which, probably, is the most reliable source on Jack The Ripper who allegedly selected his victims from prostitutes who witnessed a secret wedding between one of their friends and a prince from the Royal Palace in order to prevent this scandal to be known by the public. This mere fact is enough to suggest that Jack The Ripper, along with orders to kill were from the Royal Family. However, the way he kills victims in a ritualistic way suggests that there were other motives involved other than merely getting rid of the witnesses.
I have to admit that 'From Hell' didn't turn out to be as good as I hoped it would be. This is a kind of movie where each scene is nicely done but when you put them together they lack soul. Hughes brothers have done everything right, the camera angles, locations, decoration, costumes, acting is good but when all put together, the movie still doesn't have a soul. One of the reasons for my dislike is that the characters don't seem very real. For example, Mary Kelly (Heather Graham) doesn't have the look of 19th century prostitute. Directors didn't even bother using some make up effects to make her look like a prostitute. However, all her friends  have more realistic prostitute look, which makes Marry Kelly look even more incongruous. Her relationship with Inspector Frederick George Abberline (Johny Depp) is unnaturally hurried and lacks soul. Inspector Abberline's visions of the murders are haphazard. Does he see them when they are happening or after they've happened? Does he see them when he 'chases the dragon' (when he is high on opium) or anytime when he feels like it? In one scene, he touches the wall near the crime scene and picks up some visions. I have found his visions to be very chaotic and not adding any excitement to the story at all. They just create some visuals but that's all. The victims are not introduced to the audience in a way that will make them likable. That's why, you don't feel any sympathy when they are murdered. I have found a lack of excitement there too. I have also noticed one technical mistake: in one scene (I guess it was right after the second murder), a cop turns the corner and sees the dead body lying on the sidewalk. You see him right before he turns the corner and after he turns the corner and sees the dead body. There is not one single visible reaction in his movement. He doesn't pace up to rush to the dead body, he doesn't seem to stop for a moment in surprise. From the beginning of the scene to its end, his speed and movements are unnaturally unvarying. What I liked: From Hell is a highly stylish movie with a quite realistic depiction of 19th century London. Costumes, locations, set decoration  and the way the scenes are shot are stylish. It is always nice to watch Johny Depp although this is not one of his best acting performances. The story is very true to the original book in the sense that it grows on all of the characters who were, in reality, accused of being Jack The Ripper. The story, at the end, remains to be loyal to the widely accepted theory.
If you like horror movies and enjoy serial killer themes, there is a great chance you might enjoy From Hell. But if you are expecting a serious movie with a strong plot, rhythm and soul 'From Hell' is likely to disappoint you.",5,2,4,17 December 2001
Titanic," Classic Titanic tale flavored with romance, superbly directed
","We all know the story of Titanic. Telling it through the eyes of ordinary characters would be dull. James Cameron smartly decided to make this a movie about romance between two lovers Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose (Kate Winslet). I think the strong romance actually works and makes the audience care more about what happens to them, and of course, to the ship. This is a very sad story - as you might guess. The scenes after the ship hits the iceberg and everything goes haywire are shot with cinematic excellence. I believe this movie still remains to be the highest grossing films of all time and most number of Oscars earned. The only thing that bothers me every time Kate and Leonardo co-star in a movie, it is always Kate that gets nominated and Leonardo is always passed. I hope his day will come soon.",8,1,2,3 September 2010
Mystic River," Mystic River: I give it a 7 out of 10.
","Mystic RiverMystic River is a psychological thriller that looks at a murder case from the points of view of three main characters: Sean (Kevin Bacon) a cop, trying to solve the case, Jimmy (Sean Penn), the father of the victim, and Dave (Tim Robins), an old friend of the two who might be hiding something about the murder. The movie begins by showing us those three characters when they were kids playing street hockey on the street, followed by an event that will change Dave's life forever. It is due to the distress this event has brought upon on Dave's character that will later draw suspicions on him about the murder. When we are brought back to present time, we see that Jimmy is running a grocery store and has a daughter; Dave is also married and has a kid. After the murder, we are introduced to present-time Sean, who is the investigator on the case. Mystic River succeeds in keeping the audience guessing until the end while questioning the concepts of prejudice, justice and karma. Jimmy's insistence on taking the matters into his own hands to punish the killer reveals his aggressive side which, combined with his obstinate prejudice and criminal tendency, makes us gradually lose our sympathy for him despite the tragedy. Jimmy's first suspect is her daughter's secret boyfriend, son of Just Ray, with whom Jimmy had a feud with in his criminal past. But our attention quickly turns to Dave as his alleged story about the confrontation with the mugger at the night of the murder looks less credible due to his deeply troubled and disturbed character. Instead of feeling sorry for Jimmy, who lost his daughter, we find ourselves feeling sorry for Dave who might have something to do with the murder. 
The first thing that stands out about `Mystic River' is the Oscar-caliber performances of Sean Penn and Tim Robbins. Performances of Marcia Gay Harden, Laurence Fishburne and Laura Linney are also worth mentioning. Second thing that caught my attention was that it rightly gives you the feeling that is adapted from a powerful book. Clint Eastwood does a good job of directing but it is not his directing that makes the movie work. It is the performances of the actors and the strength of the book the movie is based on that makes it work. Having said that, I also must say that there are some parts of the movie which, in my opinion, do not work as well as they are intended to. The phone calls from Sean's wife fail to rouse any feeling, probably due to the fact that we are not familiar enough with both characters or the nature of their dispute. It might have been better if the introduction (act 1) of the movie were stretched just a little longer to give us some familiarity with all of the characters. Instead, most attention is given to the act 2, the investigation. However, what bothered me the most was the Sean's reaction to the revelation by Jimmy in the end because it appeared to be in conflict with the portrayal of his character. I guess the signals were there during the interrogation scenes, where Sean played the `good cop' for his friend Dave, but the bad cop for the boyfriend, that Sean was moved by his emotions. Otherwise, there would be no reason for him to not carry out his duties like a rational police officer.",7,0,0,16 October 2003
The Departed," An explosive crime-thriller! Could be the best movie of the year.
","Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) are two new Police Academy graduates who are trying to make it into the police department. However, Colin has been raised by the notorious Irish mafia crime-lord Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) and is only there to infiltrate the police dept. He makes it through the interview and becomes an employee of the unit whereas Billy is denied the same opportunity. Instead, Billy is offered to take an assignment as an undercover cop to infiltrate the mafia. But this is a very special assignment and only two police officers, Oliver Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) know that Billy is actually a cop.So, we have two men each working secretly for the other side and no one, except their bosses, knows their true identities. Soon, each side realizes that there is a mole in their unit and tries to uncover his identity. That's when things start to get tricky. As each party tries to inform their boss about the possible future actions of the other side, it turns into a dangerous game. Colin warns his boss Costello ahead of time because he knows about the operations of the police department and Billy tries to inform Oliver and Dignam about what Costello is up to.This is truly an excellent film that will keep you at the edge of your seat until the very end. The plot is very well-written and, despite the many twists and turns, it feels completely natural. I feel the need to say a few things about Leonardo DiCaprio. I have always liked his acting but his performance in this movie is truly magical. He has matured as an actor and he completely steals the show in this one. He is explosive! All the other actors are actually performing very well.I am not a big fan of remakes and this is a remake of an originally a 2002 Hong Kong movie, 'Mou gaan dou' (see the name Siu Fai Mak in the writing credits; he is the screenplay writer for the original movie). Having said that, I must admit that this movie really blew me away and I am not a kind of guy who is easily blown away. This could be the best movie of the year.",10,2,4,29 October 2006
Stranger Than Fiction," Stranger Than Fiction - one of the best movies of 2006
","If I were asked to guess who wrote the screenplay of this movie, I would definitely say 'Charlie Kaufman' because this is exactly the kind of story that could come from the mind of Charlie Kaufman (except in this case, we owe our thanks to Zach Helm). In this stranger-than-fiction tale, our hero, Harold Crick is an IRS agent who lives his life by calculating every step, carefully planing his day, his schedule instead of enjoying the moment. One day something goes wrong with his wrist watch while he is asleep and then he starts to hear his life being narrated by a female voice. It is funny that just as the narrator is introducing us to the character of Harold Crick, the very same character (who is supposed to be merely fictional) also hears the same narration. Soon, the voice becomes quite intrusive and makes him lose his train of thought. Harold goes to a doctor seeking advice about this weird situation. Of course, the first thing that comes to doctor's mind is that Harold is going insane or probably schizophrenic. Considering this may not be the case, Harold ends up seeking help from a literature professor Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman) who tries to understand what kind of story Harold is in (comedy or tragedy?). In the meantime, Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson) the voice inside Harold Crick's mind, is actually a real-life author and writing a story about her character...well...Harold Crick. But the bad news is that, at the end of every story, Kay kills her main character - something that puts Harold on the edge. Harold, who is not very good at socializing with others and who is a very lonely man, starts to open up a little and connects with the woman he desires, a young woman named Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal). But, if the story's ending doesn't change Harold's life will cease to exist. This is a very good movie with an inspirational message about the meaning of life. If we think about it, the author Kay is more like a God figure because she decides who lives and who dies. We can think of ourselves as characters in a book written by God. And if knew the exact time of our death, how would we continue to live our life or could we continue at all? The movie's message is strong and inspirational: live your life without calculating every step, be more spontaneous, stop being so result-focused and indulge yourself in the little details of life, enjoy the moment. After all, these are the things that makes life so precious. This message comes way before the ending but the ending puts a cherry on top of this message. I highly recommend Stranger Than Fiction to anyone who is interested in the meaning of life. I give it a 8 out of 10.",8,1,2,31 December 2006
Inception," A Christopher Nolan Classic - one of the best movies of 2010
","Let me start by saying that Inception is not a movie for all audience. If you are familiar with director Christopher Nolan's style and vision, you know what I am talking about. And if you don't know what I am talking about, you should probably stay away from Inception.Christopher Nolan's movies are quite complex, multi-layered, story- within-story type of movies (remember Memento?). You will probably have to watch it a few times to put it altogether and even then you may not be able to solve everything as some things are still left to viewer's interpretation. If you are looking for a movie which will make total sense, stay away.You must believe the logic of the movie: there is a device that enables a person to enter the mind of another person while he is dreaming. The purpose of this is basically to intercept the creation process of the mind that occurs during dream state and steal ideas from subconscious. When the mind is in a dream state, it continues to create and at the same time observes what it creates. These two processes happen concurrently, we don't even notice. The movie also introduces the idea of planting an idea in someone's mind, a process called inception.Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) accepts the mission to do an inception in the hopes that he can return to USA to his children, puts together a team of experts and plans the heist. The rest is a lot of action sequences that go deeper and deeper into subconscious.I think Inception is a very well-crafted movie, action scenes are amazing, especially the upside-down fight scene in the hall. I also like the editing, sound editing and sound mixing. Even though the concept is not totally original, the screenplay and its execution is quite stylish and unique. Most people criticize this movie being too similar to The Matrix but I disagree. Entering another realm which looks like reality and being bound by the rules of that realm are probably the only common trait both movies share. Inception sets itself apart from the Matrix with its unique style, and totally different plot.",8,1,5,21 January 2011
The Good Shepherd," Intriguing subject of early history of CIA
","The Good Shepherd's subject material is very intriguing but the movie has some problems. The story revolves around the character of Edward Wilson (Matt Damon) who is asked to join the agency to run some operations back in 1939. But the current time line is actually 1961 so the movie goes back and forth in time as different incidents take place within the agency. The main problem with the movie is that it is trying to do too much. There are so many characters in the movie and because we see them only for a brief period of time, we don't feel anything for the characters. There is not enough character development. It is essential for a movie to establish some kind of bonding between the audience and its characters. This movie fails to do that miserably. Although I had no problem with Matt Damon's acting before, I was very disappointed by his flat performance. I am not sure what his character is supposed to be. Is he supposed to be brutal, cold-blooded person? Or is he supposed to be devoted to his work at all costs, moral/immoral, good/bad, brave/coward? His character lacks depth and is very flat I am not sure what he is. Since his character is the focal point of the story, it really takes away from the film's power. All the other characters, Sam Murach (Alec Baldwin), Philip Allen (William Hurt), Edward's son, his son's girlfriend, and all the other characters have so little screen time, audience doesn't know what to feel about them. The only characters that seemed to convey some real emotions were Edward's wife (Angelina Jolie), Edward's mute girlfriend Laura (Tammy Blanchard) and John Turturo's character: Ray Brocco. All the other characters had their functions in the story but conveyed no importance to me. This could be a very good TV series. Develop all those characters and stretch them out in a 2-3 year season TV series.",6,1,3,31 December 2006
Carrie," A Horror Classic
","Carrie is a bona fide horror classic. In my opinion, it is one of the best Stephen King's adaptations ever made (if you are a Stephen King fan like myself, you know how hard it is to adapt his books to big screen). Brian De Palma did a terrific job of bringing Carrie to life.This is a story about a very vulnerable girl with a super power: she can move objects with her mind, known as telekinesis. Her mother kept her sheltered. Piper Laurie portrayed Carrie's mother really well, a religious fanatic who has lost touch with reality. As a result, Carrie is disconnected from society and not living a very normal life. She is constantly bullied at school by other girls.The score is one of the most important elements of a movie but this is especially true in case of horror movies. Carrie's score is just amazing. You can get chills just by listening to the soundtrack. I especially love the way how the score sets the atmosphere of the scene. I have seen many horror movies but Carrie is special in the way how the score sets the tone so perfectly well. SLIGHT Spoiler ALERT******One of my favorite scenes is right before Carrie is crowned home coming queen; there is a dreamy music playing intervened by ominous music and it switches back and forth creating drama and suspense at the same time.I think Carrie deserves a minimum rating of 8. They don't make horror movies like Carrie anymore.",8,3,4,13 February 2011
The Silence of the Lambs," Put the lotion in the basket!!!!!!!
","Silence of the Lambs is probably the best movie of its kind. Its sheer intensity is unmatched. It is a superbly well-written story that involves multiple very dangerous characters, most notorious of which is Dr. Lecter (Hannibal). An FBI agent, Clarice Starling (wonderfully portrayed by Jodie Foster) needs to extract information from a dangerous psychopath Hannibal Lecter (amazingly brought to life by Anthony Hopkins) about a serial killer called Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine).There are so many elements that make Silence Of The Lambs chillingly scary. Buffalo Bill chooses young female victims and skins them. He kidnaps the daughter of a senator which quickly prompts an FBI hunt. Agent Clarice visits Dr. Lecter who is held in a maximum security prison to ask him questions about Buffalo Bill's psychological profile because he was Dr. Lecter's patient many years ago....when Dr. Lecter was a normal human being (if you can call it that).I have always found the idea of a psychologist going insane and becoming a human eating monster very scary. I mean he is supposed to be the expert about human behavior to cure psychological disturbances and he is the most disturbed of all. However, he is equally brilliant. Dr. Lecter's brilliant mind brings depth to his character. Clarice's difficult task of understanding and deciphering the mind of -not one but- two psychopaths creates multi-dimensions.I don't want to say too much about the story and what happens next. But let me say that the movie is full of suspense and literally breath-taking moments. After 20 years, I have not seen any other similar type of movie that I enjoyed as much as I enjoyed Silence of the Lambs. This movie completely changes the serial killer characters in movies and adds depth to them in an unprecedented fashion. Killers in movies like Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Friday the 13th, Halloween (the major horror franchises) gave us faceless monsters with no character depth. They wouldn't say a word or even make a sound (this was probably done to disassociate them from regular human beings). Even though this seemed to have worked, Silence of the Lambs' depiction of killer monsters in more elaborate fashion works even better.",10,2,3,13 September 2010
The Sixth Sense," An instant classic of a supernatural thriller
","I can easily say that 'The Sixth Sense' is an instant classic because it really has a very unique story-telling and approaches the ghost-human beings conflict in an original way.Dr. Malcolm (Bruce Willis) is trying to help a young kid, Cole (Haley Joel Osment) with his psychological problems and, at the same, trying to fix his relationship with his wife who has become quite distant lately. The story mostly revolves around Cole who claims to see dead people. But it is also about Dr. Malcolm who helps Cole to cope with his unusual gift. And in return, he learns something important about himself.The famous twist at the end is quite shocking but there are some clues during the movie which are intelligently concealed. The Sixth Sense is a GREAT movie and a must-watch for all audiences. It has been nominated for 6 Academy awards including the best picture, best screenplay, best director (M. Night Shyamalan), best supporting actress (Toni Collette)and best supporting actor Haley Joel Osment, at the age of 12.",10,0,0,9 October 2006
Final Destination," Terrible, terrible movie
","At the beginning, the plot seemed promising but then it turned out to be terribly stupid. What bothered me most about the movie was the way they used cheap techniques to make it scary. And by that I mean all the stupid, non-sense accident scenes which are supposed to scare you. Now we are led to believe that 'death has a pattern and chooses its victims according to that pattern'. Suppose that it is true, why do all the people have to die in bizarre accidents? Are there not other ways of dying, say a heart-attack or sudden internal-bleeding or any sort of sickness? And why has it never occurred to the main character that the next victim could die just by a natural cause and not by accident? But no, people had to die in those bizarre accidents so the audience could be scared! Well, I was neither scared nor amused by these cheap tricks; I wonder who were. Throughout the movie I kept I wondering what the main message was, that death has a pattern, that we can change it? And why death always had to come as accident? Could the main character stop deaths from happening if it came as, say cancer? And one more thing: why did the main character have to presume that death was going to come immediately right after it took a victim. I mean just because he figured out who the next victim was going to be and could make a list of that, it did not mean that death was gonna hit the next victim right away!!! It could have taken 10 years for death to strike its next victim. It seemed as if not only did the main character know in advance the cause of death but the time of the death too. So, I think these otherwise-could-be false presumptions were expected to be taken for granted and the events were deliberately set-up which made the whole thing seem so obvious. Not a good scary movie.",4,4,8,7 August 2000
The Matrix," The Most Philosophical Science Fiction Movie Ever!
","There are so many reasons why I think 'The Matrix' is the most brilliant science fiction movie ever made but I like to present its philosophical implications because that's what interested me most. Now, most people may think that 'The Matrix' is just a great science fiction movie with lots of amazing special effects but there is more to it than that. As a person with special interest in philosophy, I was amazed by the plot. It's like Plato's theory of forms converted into a science fiction plot! Plato is one of the greatest philosophers of all time from ancient Greece who theorized that the world we live in is not real. Instead, it is a reflection of a real world and all the objects we see are mere shadows of the ideal forms which exit in that real world. I do not want to go into much detail for I think the implication is obvious: The world we live in is 'The Matrix' where nothing is real; it is a computer-generated reality in which human minds are trapped while our real brains are hooked up to a giant computer administering that program to consume our energy. So everything we see is just a reflection of the objects created in that program, electronic signals stimulating our nerves to give us the impression that we are actually sensing material objects. In fact we are just watching the shield put in front of our eyes to prevent us from seeing the truth (just like in Plato's cave). Now this plot is amazingly parallel with the most recent findings in physics; Bertrand Russell explained it in a completely scientific way that we can never know if the real world exists because all we sense is just electronic signals stimulating our senses; we cannot know where these electronic signals are coming from or if the source of these signals is a 'material substance' in the sense we think of the term. 'The Matrix' suggests that these signals are delivered to us by a computer. There have been many empiricist philosophers, like George Berkeley and David Hume who denied the existence of the material world but their methods of proving their theories were not as scientific as the ones developed in the mid 1900s. 'The Matrix' is a movie where implications in these philosophical theories are presented in science fiction which, I think, makes 'The Matrix' so special. I sometimes think that this world is not real and our real existence lies in another dimension. I have friends who have the exact same feeling. Those of you who have similar thoughts will find the science fictional interpretation of their thoughts in 'The Matrix'. 
The fact that 'The Matrix' is a computer-generated reality makes all the visual effects, specially the fighting scenes, very plausible. Luckily, this fact makes it possible to create any kind of visual effects without the risk of making it look unrealistic (this is a computer program, anything can be real). 'The Matrix' is definitely one of its kind; it is not like most other science fiction movies where humans are against aliens. The screenplay is so original that it makes it surpass all other science fiction movies except, maybe my other science fiction favourite, 'The Planet Of The Apes'. I cannot imagine a science fiction fan not liking this movie.",10,0,0,12 August 2000
Heat," Heat doesn't provide much heat
","I saw Heat when it first came out to theaters back in 1995. I also recently saw The Town. Many people claim Heat is the better picture and that Town took its story and basic plot elements from Heat.Even though there are similarities, I think The Town doesn't deserve most of the criticism and Heat doesn't deserve most of the acclaim. In my opinion Heat is way too long. The director (Michael Mann whom I like) wanted to show too much about the personal love affairs of the characters. I know this was done for the purpose of character development but it was too shallow and didn't develop anything. It was too shallow because the problem of each love affair was the same: character's job (either police or criminal). And the same thing was repeated for all 3 characters, Vincent (Al Pacino), Neil (Robert De Niro) and Chris (Val Kilmer). They all have problems in their relationships. I think the movie is trying to do too much; it should have either focused on the relationships of characters and made it a drama or should have focused on the crime aspect and made it action/suspense. For example, in the beginning we see Al Pacino making love to his wife, taking a shower, all long scenes, and then there are scenes where his step daughter Lauren (Natalie Portman) is arguing with his mother because she is unhappy about her father. I thought these scenes really didn't add anything to the story.I also think the some scenes in Heat is too much Hollywoodized - it's funny because most people actually make this accusation about the Town. My examples are ******SPOILER ALERT*****: Robert De Niro is supposedly a very disciplined character (so disciplined that he can leave everything behind if he senses the heat around the corner). But then we see him slapping one of his team members in a diner where everyone is watching. Tom Sizemore gives a dirty look to one of the patrons. I thought this scene was totally Hollywoodish to show they are really tough guys. Why would a disciplined criminal would beat up his team member in a diner? That would draw attention and is risky. Later we see them outside the diner trying to finish up the job. They are about to take care of the guy but they lose him, right in front of their eyes. All these scenes made me dislike The Heat. Also at the very end, it is the wrong guy who gets shot. It is the wrong guy because he had major advantage over the other guy who should have been the one to get shot. That scene was poorly designed*******.There are good things about heat. It is a fine crime/drama. Robert De Niro is great although I find his romantic affair to be unrealistic and lack of feeling. I think Heat probably deserves a rating of 7. I also predict that within a year or so, The Town will surpass Heat's rating.",7,1,5,25 October 2010
The Thin Red Line," One of the Best War Movies ever - true masterpiece of cinema
","The Thin Red Line is a true masterpiece of cinema. When I watched it in theaters in 1998 I absolutely fell in love with it. I recently purchased the Criterion Blu ray release and realized that after 13 years, I am still very much in love with this movie.The Thin Red Line is not a typical war movie. It is not driven by action alone. It explores the duality of nature and draws parallelism between the struggle within nature and the struggle within each man. It achieves this through poetic cinematography, philosophical narration voice-overs, great battle scenes and great casting from the best actors in the business.The duality of nature is presented from the opening shot. A crocodile leaves the shore and moves into the water. The setting is a beautiful island. There is something about watching the most horrible event in all humanity, war, within a setting so beautiful, it touches your soul. Where the nature lives in harmony, soldiers are fighting a war. This duality continues all throughout the movie and never ceases to amaze. One of my favorite scenes is when the soldiers are walking through the grass, an aboriginal Indian is walking the other way, and when they are in the same frame, soldiers look like the alien element and the Indian seems to perfectly mesh with nature.The other unique aspect of The Thin Red Line is that it gives us the inner thoughts and feelings of the characters. Often, people put up a facade and keep their feelings inside. This is another duality the film presents through voice-overs. Soldiers do not always think about winning. They are human beings and they often dream about being home, going home, and they fear. In that regard, the movie is very realistic.The Thin Red Line also explores the morality in times of war, and the difficulty of making the right decision under extra-ordinary circumstances where the given objective (a military order) could compromise the sacredness of human life. This struggle is presented through the conflicts of colonel Tall (Nick Nolte) with captain James Staros (Elias Koteas) and sergeant Welsh (Sean Penn) with private Witt (Jim Caviezel).One indisputable fact is cinematography of the film is absolutely fantastic. The trees, the water, the hills, birds, all the colors of the island come alive (even more so on the Blu ray). The casting is one of the greatest ones you will witness. Two-times academy winner Sean Penn is here, Elias Koteas, Nick Nolte, Woody Harrelson, James Caviezel, John Travolta and George Clooney make brief appearances as well (also academy award winner Adrien Brody has brief appearance and John C. Reiley and Jared Leto)",10,1,3,16 January 2011
Slumdog Millionaire," the most overrated movie of the year
","Slumdog Millionaire's premise is so cliché that I cannot believe the hype; it's the story of a poor boy in love with a girl and some bad guys in between them. I don't know how many movies I have seen with this exact same premise. There must be literally thousands of Asian, Mid-Eastern movies with exact same story. Many people here complain about insult to India as a country. How about insult to all the other great movies that have not been recognized by the Academy? How about the great Afghan, Iranian movies that are actually much smarter and original than Slumdog Millionaire but somehow never get to be seen by the American Audience? What about the insult to them? Slumdog Millionaire's commercial success solely depends upon the producers, and nothing more (and maybe due to the fact that most Americans are not familiar with this kind of story or maybe hungry for unrealistic, almost fairy-tale like love story, innocence kept through hard-times). There is not one original idea in the entire movie. I easily predicted everything before it happened, including the ending. No surprises, no clever screenplay, no great acting.... I guess the only cinematic achievement in the movie was the excellent photography. The sceneries from India's ghettos were just amazing in the sense of photographic quality. Lastly, Academy should be ashamed of nominating this movie as the best picture not to mention in many other categories. The Kite Runner, a far superior picture didn't get single nomination. What an insult to the artists who worked in that movie.",5,6,10,24 January 2009
The Social Network," A movie about origins of facebook
","The Social Network is a well-made movie about the origins of facebook. The movie begins with Mark Zuckerberg (to-be creator of facebook) having dinner with his girlfriend and this opening scene perfectly introduces Mark's character and sets the tone of the movie. He is an intelligent kid who is not socially adept. You can tell this by the way he talks to his girlfriend and what he does after the dinner. He goes to his dorm and writes bad things about his girlfriend on the web and insults her publicly. He also breaks into the school's database server, steals people's pictures from the directory and sets them up on the web in doubles as part of a competition to pick who is the hotter girl. The Social Network shows how someone, while creating a brilliant tool that minimizes the distance between people, is creating a distance between him and the people around him. That is ironic. It also makes you question if morals and smart business decisions should always be in agreement. Because the decisions he makes are actually earning him benefits as an entrepreneur but creating conflicts with the others. I found myself wanting to side with him because he is a clever guy but he also has a way of looking down on people in a condescending way or pretending as if they don't exist.The movie also makes you think the delicate connection between an idea as inception and its execution. You may have an idea but if you don't have the ability to execute the idea and turn it into a reality, you will be dependent on someone else. The executing ability could be better than just having the idea. I think this is a movie that anyone can appreciate and will find its subject matter interesting. After all Facebook has revolutionized how people socialize today.",8,0,0,14 October 2010
The Bourne Supremacy," Supremely Entertaining 2nd Installment to The Bourne Identity
","This is just as entertaining and awesome as the Bourne Identity, if not better. Our hero Jason is in India trying to stay off the radar of those who are after him but that doesn't seem to be possible. We learn more details about The project Treadstone and Bourne's past. In this movie, the Ward Abbott (Brian Cox) character comes to front and also Pamela Landy (Joan Allen).The car chase scenes (shot in the streets of Moscow, Russia) must be the best car chase scenes ever shot in the history of cinema. The Bourne Identity also had incredible high speed car scenes shot in France but Supremacy takes it to another level, a supreme level you might say. There are some parallel scenes from Bourne Identity the first movie (the fight scene inside the apartment and the chase scenes where Bourne escapes his pursuers). Despite the parallel scenes, this movie is still unique.The action scenes, chase scenes, the plot, the characters make this movie, like the Bourne Identity, superbly entertaining to watch. I highly recommend it. The entire Bourne Trilogy is probably the best spy thrillers we have seen in many years, maybe the best in the history of cinema.",10,1,2,8 September 2010
Law Abiding Citizen," Interesting premise executed badly
","After the killer of his family is set free due to legal technicality, Clyde (Gerrard Butler), fights the justice system. The premise is compelling as it points out how the technicalities in the judicial system is standing in the way of the justice. Since Clyde cannot change the system, he decides to fight it in a criminal fashion. Soon enough we find him convicted and in jail. However, his enemies are strangely falling victim to inexplicable attacks and there is no perpetrator in sight. Inexplicability of the attacks and Clyde's continuously taunting district attorney Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) is what keeps the momentum in the movie. It is all entertaining and fun but the end the movie fails to deliver. When you find out how the attacks were actually carried out, you will be like 'What!?? Really??!!'. Not only is it unrealistic, it is laughable. It is very cliché, Hollywoodesque wrapping on what could be a serious picture. This movie doesn't deserve a rating higher than 6.",6,0,1,3 September 2010
