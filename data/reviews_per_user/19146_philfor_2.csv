Miracle," Disney-ized version of the story
","Check out the HBO documentary Miracle on Ice or the 1981 Karl Malden version before watching this one.Herb Brooks was a very intense, emotional man whose language doesn't fit into the Disney universe. Unfortunately, the Kurt Russell character seems more like the Emilio Estevez coach in Mighty Ducks. Overall the film does a good job in recreating the 1980 miracle but it does not satisfy this viewer with the raw emotion that was so palpable in 1980.The HBO documentary is much better in delivering the story and has interviews with the players, Herb Brooks and Al Michaels.",7,0,3,7 June 2004
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Good adaptation
","Very faithful adaptation of the book but overall unsatisfying addition to the series. Radcliffe and Watson continue to grow into their roles but Rupert Grint's Ron Weasley has lost his charm. Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman are utterly wasted with almost no screen time to develop their characters.Michael Gambon is a poor substitute as Dumbledore. Perhaps, he could be replaced by a CGI Dumbledore.The characters of Lupin and Black were well done and certainly carried the film. My rating 6 out of 10.",6,0,1,17 June 2004
