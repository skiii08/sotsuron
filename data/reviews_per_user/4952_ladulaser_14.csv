The Rock," See and HEAR it!
","This film is so underestimated it is almost a shame. Believable characters, somewhat unbelievable story and the greatest soundtrack of the 90s puts this movie as a middle-step between Terminator 2 and The Matrix in action movie history!",10,2,2,29 October 2001
The Ring," As good as original but in a different way
","I watched both this newer version and the japanese original in the same day. Thus, the japanese version was not as frightening, as I knew what to expect and when to expect it. If I had seen the japanese version first, though, I think I would've found that one better.One notorious difference between the two Rings is that the japanese is just about 95 minutes while the american one runs for almost 2 hours. It becomes clear why when they are compared in the same day as I did - the japanese main characters seem to have some kind of psychometric powers, i.e. the ability to see past events related to an object or a person that they touch. The american version is more true to scientific method and lets the characters find out more for themselves in a 'logical' manner. The quote-marks I just used are of course there since there isn't much logic to be expected in this movie.I definitely love both versions, I am giving both 9 out of 10, perhaps I would give the japanese a 9 and the american an 8.5 if possible, but they are good in so different ways that they're almost two different horror movies, although you recognize most scenes and often even the camera angles and architecture of the rooms and the steps inside the houses where the action takes place! This is a Blair Witch Project for the 00's, let's just hope that the sequel isn't as bad as in the Blair Witch case.",9,1,1,1 March 2003
12 Angry Men," Something for us mature cineasts (SPOILING POSSIBLE)
","I do not suppose that many of the pupils at the senior high where I work would appreciate this film. It features some nice things that used to be around until the '70s, but that now have been vanquished. At least from Sweden. For example:* Respect for older people * A jury consisting of males only * Black & white film :)WARNING! THE FOLLOWING HALF OF MY TEXT MIGHT SPOIL THE FILM FOR YOUEven though the movie was a criminology drama, it didn't feature any twist at the ending that revolved the whole outcome of the judgment you've been building up during the whole first hour and a half. The convincing is totally linear, except for one jury member changing his mind (between the two votes 'guilty'/'not guilty') twice. I would have liked to see a script with a bit more thought behind it. Anyway, there's nothing wrong with the quality of the acting, the filming or the sound, and maybe the linear story is kind of unusual for a criminology drama. So I am going to give it a 9 out of 10.",9,0,3,27 November 2002
Blade," Nothing special about it
","I don't really think very much of this movie. It's basically a B-action with 90's computer animation capacity at about 35% of its full potential, the story and characters are just about as deep and exciting as you would expect from a B-action.The only thing I found sorta funny about watching this movie was a 'rave' party, obviously depicted by someone who has NEVER been to a real rave but rather just watched the covers of 'Rave Mission' (german techno CD compilations). 4 out of 10 is all I can give this movie, and considered it's almost featureless, I think I've been nice by posting that vote.",4,1,2,24 March 2002
My Neighbor Totoro," Keeps and leaves you with a big SMILE!
","Last night, I went to a rave party. Because of that, I can't sleep tonight, even as tomorrow is my birthday. So I decided to watch some anime. Tonari no Totoro had been given a very nice average score here at imdb, so I settled for it. It seems fortune itself has decided to give me this birthday present that is the pure joy of watching this movie. I mentioned in a review of another anime (Kiki's Delivery Service), that it reminded me of Astrid Lindgren's 'Pippi Longstockings' which I was fed with as a swedish child. This movie is just about as fine! It gives me an insight of what it must've been like to be a child growing up at the countryside in the japanese 50s (which I guess is the setting for this movie), and at the same time it reminds me of what it was like for myself to grow up back when I lived in a house in the suburbs of Stockholm with a fairly large garden.I started smiling after watching this movie for about ten minutes, then I kept on smiling unto the worrying part (you will know what I mean if you have seen/will see the movie). How about that, by the way? An anime for kids that gets a 22-year old like me worried when the plot becomes saddening? Anyway, when the credits started rolling by with a beautiful, playful song in the background, I was smiling once again. This movie deserves no other grade than a 10, and that's what I'm about to give it :)<ul><li>Johan</li></ul>",10,5,6,21 July 2002
Lost in Translation," If you want to BECOME bored... (spoiler alert?)
","I just watched this film, and I asked myself: What was the MESSAGE? What was it that every critic in the Swedish movie magazines saw or heard that I didn't see or hear? This movie amounts to NOTHING! It's just a movie about a middle-aged man and a young girl who are very bored in Tokyo, so half an hour into the movie they decide to go out and do something together (the first 30 minutes could've just been cut away if you ask me! This should've been a TV movie...).So, they go out and party, meet a couple of times, but the middle-aged man - who is having a tough time with his wife at home who constantly reminds him how much his children miss him and stuff - knows just how old he is and thus do not attempt to score with the young woman.When they're done partying after a few days, it's just 'good-bye forever'. So to sum it up: There is no POINT in the plot, there is a minimum of (and an embarrasingly bad written) dialogue, and the milleu is not THAT beautiful, although the movie makers seem to want to give the audience that impression, since there are a lot of scenes with people just walking around in Japan.I watched this during the mid-day in my home, without any company and I was quite tired and bored. This movie is already boring, and I was glad I didn't have a hangover, because this movies pace would've made me throw up. So, for what kind of situation was this movie made? My guess is in my one-line summary: It is a movie for times when you want to BECOME bored. And how often do you want that? Exactly. A totally pointless movie, and I wish I hadn't wasted a bit of my precious lifetime by watching it. I can recommend to all you who read this to NOT go see this movie. Sincerely, from the bottom of my heart.<ul><li>Johan Ryd√©n</li></ul>jory@nacka.se if you got an opinion you want to share...",1,3,6,21 February 2004
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Excellent as always
","Well, what can I comment now, before the movies' official worldwide premiere? I'll stick to what has already been mentioned in the press I guess, since I don't want to spoil this movie for anyone, just like I had Episode I spoiled for me (some jerk told me which people dies at the end of the first episode).The movie resembles Episode V in a lot of ways. The only way I can mention without spoiling anything is that just like Episode V, it is the typical middle-step of a triology, where nothing REALLY majestic happens, but rather it's just a drive-in to the final part of the triology.However, since this was also the case in the first triology, which is now an immortal classic, I dare to give this movie 10 points.",10,0,0,13 May 2002
Moulin Rouge!," Not what I expected
","Another typical 'french', dark, romantic tragedy with a very transparent intrigue. Only funny the first ten minutes, if you don't get a headache because of all the effects that are thrown at you at an insane tempo. Maybe enjoyable for the masses (look at this movie's score!), but for an intellectual Mensan like me, this movie is of no value since it does not present anything I haven't thought of before.",2,0,1,29 October 2001
Grave of the Fireflies," Oh my GOD!
","I've been watching a lot of 'top' animated movies lately, just by seeing which japanese animated titles that have made to the animation top 50 here at imdb. Last night, I saw 'My Neighbour Totoro', which just made me smile. This movie effectively turned my lips up-side down, into a most saddened face. I have friends I know would be depressed for days or even weeks after seeing movies like this one. The animation is great and everything, but this STORY! Besides, I can't BELIEVE that it's rated 'PG' in the US, this movie should be rated 18 just because of depressing content! If a parent saw this movie with its kid, how would he or she explain to the child all the horrifics of war that are depicted in this movie? The child could get hurt for the rest of its poor life! I'm glad I didn't see this movie during the winter, 'cause if I hadn't had the beautiful weather to sheer me up, I would've started off my 22nd birthday (today) by crying!I give this movie 9 out of 10, I just can't give a movie this depressing the highest grade possible, even if it might be worth it from a cineast point of view.",9,0,1,22 July 2002
Shrek 2," I'ld even say it's better than most animes!
","Woah, what a film! I couldn't help laughing aloud on several occasions while watching it yesterday. My favorite scene must've been the commercial for 'Knights', a parody on the popular TV show 'Cops'.Everything is brilliantly made. With voice actors like Carmen Diaz, Antonio Banderas, Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy, plus SFX and GFX by Pixar, there is absolutely NOTHING to complain about on the audiovisual side. The script is well written, and when you deal with animated actors, there is not much that CAN be done wrong in the directing. The colors are just as beautiful as in Shrek 1 and follows the same color scheme, with a lot of green and red-pink-purple in shimmering, psychedelic, fairy-tale shades.The humor is of course also brilliant. This ISN'T a movie for kids, the animators were adults making a movie to be enjoyed by other adults. Some of the humor won't be comprehended by your children, and if you're a conservative right-wing Christian, you might have some difficulty explaining to them why everyone else in the movie theater is laughing. But if you're liberal and want to take your kids to the movies or they're begging you because it was such a long time ago, then here is your obvious pick!10 out of 10!",10,4,8,8 July 2004
The Matrix Reloaded," Has not quite melted in yet
","Wow, what a tan-tra (mind-blowing) movie! The action is intense just as in the prequel, although slow-motion is utilized a bit more here, almost to the point of overplaying. They could have speeded up the tempo a bit like in Crouching Tiger/Hidden Dragon... But that is just about all the complaints I have to this amazing sequel!All the impressions and information (there is of course tons of fresh Matrix philosophy) hasn't been completely processed by my brain yet, so I would advise people not to cast their votes within the first few days after having seen the movie. Maybe everyone should go watch it at least twice. I know I will. And when I have fully understood the whole movie, I somehow know that my vote - 10/10 - will be justified. That's what it all boils down to, a matter of faith. One cannot free his mind without faith :)",10,0,0,22 May 2003
The Shawshank Redemption," Beyond words
","Wow, this film was really something! I'm glad I started to watch all the top films of imdb.com's 'All time Top 250 Movies' list. Sure, The Godfather triology and Seven Samurai were great movies too, but they were way too long and I felt they rather gave me pain in the buttocks than a touch in my mind. This movie, on the other hand, has this distinguished feature; you don't want it to end. I haven't felt that way since I watched the Matrix at the cinema back in its old glory days (that goes for both the movie The Matrix and cinemas, they're out of date nowadays :)). It also made very clear to me that I never want to go to an american prison, just as little as I would like to go to a turkish prison...",10,0,0,11 December 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," A worthy final to a great movie-conversion of an epic story
","I got to see this third and final movie of the triology about the Ring at the premiere day, thanks to my job connections as a computer technician (what company would show this movie to its customers if the customers weren't geeks?). After sitting through 2 hours of presentation of Netware 6.5 (it was quite fun actually, the speaker made fun of everything), the movie was rolled up, without those annoying commercials that you get if you go to a regular session (that you have to PAY for, on top of that!).Behind me sat this corpulent middle-aged man who was complaining about EVERYthing and thought he knew better than Peter Jackson how a book should be converted into a movie. That mans idea was that all the details from the books should be displayed in the movie and everything should happen exactly the way that the books describe it, so that the book becomes the script in a way.Isn't that stupid? Some things just can't be brought from paper to silver screen. Take thoughts, for example. There are some TV series and B-movies out there where thoughts are whispered by the actor who thinks them, as the screen shows the actor walking back and forth, thus brining you the impression that he is really pondering something that's on his mind.I find that Peter Jackson has done a great job in converting the last book of the triology to movie, although it becomes a bit too much at 3 hours and 20 minutes. He cut 5 chapters from the end of the second movie (compared to the books), and those 5 chapters are now being told in movie number three. I warn you: Do NOT get a Coke or anything that contains caffeine, because half-way through, you will start wanting to go to the restrooms, and there's still a full movies worth of film left to watch!I won't give away the story details for all you people who haven't read the books, but I will say that I'm glad that the movie shows a LOT of celebration & epilogue at the end (I sincerely hope you could guess the ending would be happy in this mother-of-all-fairytales!), just like in the books.",10,0,0,19 December 2003
Goodfellas," Nominated for 'Best ripoff', or what?
","Just take a look at the top 250 list. Which movie has been at the top ALL the time (except for when Lord of The Rings was new and manage to race to the pole position and stay there for a couple of days)? It's Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather', based on a book by Mario Puzo!The Godfather is said to have been premiered in 1972 (I won't know, because I wasn't born back then), and during all the time I watched 'Goodfellas', i couldn't help feeling how much of a wannabe Martin Scorsese must've been when he directed his version of a 1900's mafia movie. He couldn't even write his own look-alike script, he had to do it JUST like Coppola and take a book about the mob and make a movie out of it. I'm not saying I could have done it any better, but how much of a rip-off isn't this 'Goodfellas'?Nothing wrong about the execution of the movie shooting though. Good actors, although I'm sick and tired of seeing Robert De Niro as a mobster. I'll give this movie a 4 out of 10.",4,7,23,29 November 2002
