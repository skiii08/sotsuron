It," What a buildup, what a letdown
","Oh man. I read Stephen King's IT a couple years back and was enthralled. It's creepy, funny, disturbing, inappropriate and so much more. To say I built this movie is up is quite the understatement and honestly this is the first negative review I'm writing on here. I feel bad doing it but we all have opinions and I suppose we are entitled to them. That said, IT is not a good movie. There is just something completely off about this film that starts when the movie rolls and it never quite goes away. First, it's not scary. Yes, I know fear is subjective so maybe you will think it is, but I'm just not sure how. I saw people giving Pennywise Freddy Krueger comparisons before the film was released in the U.S. and I couldn't sit still at work that day. Freddy Krueger?? I went on a Thursday evening, before its technical release in theaters, and boy was I met with a feeling I can't really describe. I felt broken. First, the movie is choppy. The editing is all over the place and even after reading the book, it's hard to know how a lot of these characters even come together in the film. I can't begin to fathom how difficult it would be to make a novel into a movie. I really can't. Especially this one. But, man, did I have a completely different vision for this film. After reading on the Duffer Brothers and their push for this film (rejected) into their eventual success with Stranger Things, it does now seem that IT as a high-budget television series would be perfect. For starters, there are so many characters and stories essential to IT that didn't make their way into the film. It would be impossible to get them all in there, but as we are currently seeing, a television series (if done correctly) is an excellent way to build characters, story lines and emotions throughout a 10-episode run. IT would have benefited from this medium.Second, the scares are completely random. The audience sits there as Pennywise scares his victims one-by-one, almost like we are all on a carnival joy ride. Throughout IT, I never felt any sort of connection towards the characters or the town of Derry. I actually thought the creative change to the 80s was the wrong move as well, and it felt like the actors were standing there reading lines in this choppy, strange format. The bullies were cringe-worthy. From the onset, Henry Bowers wants to kill the losers but we don't know why. We aren't shown into anyone's world (except Bev Marsh's) and those are by far the scariest scenes of the entire film. The casting of Mike and Stan is also very bad and it all just seems so cheesy and fake. I wasn't a huge fan of Bill in the movie either, honestly. Then, when some key creative changes are made from the source material later in the movie, that was about it for me. The creative differences were just too much and I saw this film playing out in a completely different light.It's tough for me to give a negative review of something because I know just how hard these people work to make a film and to create their art. I kept getting a Jim Carrey Grinch vibe from Pennywise throughout the film and I saw the evil entity more as a demon when reading the novel, and less as a stereotypical monster as this movie makes him out to be. I never got that feeling of dread I felt reading the novel and I definitely didn't get a sense of evil in the town of Derry. I'll be passing on Part 2, unfortunately.",5,1,2,7 December 2017
A Star Is Born," The MUSIC Lives On
","Real review: 7.5/10From the onset of A Star is Born, I knew I was in for quite a ride. That opening scene was AMAZING. Bringing an incredible blues heavy guitar riff to the silver screen in surround sound with the crowd going wild was absolutely what I needed to see. I felt like I was there and Bradley Cooper was beyond impressive.I thought A Star is Born was a great movie. Slow at parts? Yes. Some cheesy lines? Absolutely. But, I was so entranced by Bradley Cooper's character and how believable he was, that I sort of forgot I was watching a movie at times. He was that good in this. And, Lady Gaga was pretty damn good too for her first ever acting role. And her singing? It's out of this world. Her voice gave me chills throughout the movie, especially the song she sings at the end of the film. The movie had a lot of hype but overall, I thought it was a great movie. It was an experience. From the incredible music to the love story to the battles with fame, self-identity and addiction, Bradley Cooper nailed his directorial debut and I'm excited to see him do another one. Worth a viewing in the theater 100%!",7,1,3,12 October 2018
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," This One Didn't Quite Catch Me
","Where do I begin?First and foremost, Three Billboards is a fiery movie. Frances McDormand is, as always, superb. But, can a superb actress fix a sub-par film? As the movie begins, I really enjoyed it. It seemed like it was really heading somewhere. However, as time wore on, my opinions changed and I had no idea what this movie was attempting to say. It was also very difficult to feel any connection with McDormand's character and her daughter or son. One flashback the entire film? Strange choice.Second, there are some crazy weird scenes in this that don't quite hold up, or make any sense at all. A cop throwing a man out of a window, punching him in the face in the middle of the street and no one (not even the officer assigned to take over the Sheriff's duties) does a damn thing? I get it. It's trying to make a point. And, we've seen some crazy things in our days and times way before our generation. But, this one just didn't do it for me. I thought it was forced. Shocking. Then, things got even weirder after this.Rockwell is fired by the new Sheriff in town for his behavior. Due to the beloved Sheriff's suicide and his note to Rockwell about being a 'good man' (are we sure about this?) deep down, he needs to get his act together. As a flaming mazel tov cocktail nearly blows him to pieces, Rockwell runs through the flames (symbolism?) and is suddenly this changed man. Maybe, but again, it didn't seem very realistic to me. When the film ends, I remember sitting at my girlfriend's house and saying aloud 'what in the *expletive*?' I'm all for indie films. I'm all for different ways to tell stories. I'm all for innovation and experimentation. But, is this film really as good as so many critics said it was? Art is subjective and I want to make my own movies some day, but I just don't see it. Maybe that's the beauty of it but I'm sticking with my 5/10 and telling you to skip this one. It's just not a very good movie.",5,2,5,22 January 2018
Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping," If you're into this humor, then watch immediately
","If you're into spoofs, satires and mockumentaries that are funny as he*#, then it's time you threw on Pop Star: Never Stop Never Stopping. Anyone I've texted about this movie has replied with the same answer of, 'It looked so stupid.' But, that my friends, is why this movie is so smart. It mocks real life events in the music industry, pop culture, celebrity culture, the news and so much more. It's perfect. Just like Naked Gun, Airplane, and Scary Movie, Pop Star is the perfect mix of satire, realism and just flat out comedy. Of course it's dumb. So are humans and the real world we exist in. That's why it works so well. The best (my favorite) stand-up comics are always the ones commenting on the real world and how they fit into it. Andy Samberg knows how to create a character that seems completely absurd, but in reality, isn't that far off from reality at all. It's amazing to see and this movie is laugh out loud, cry tears type funny. Embrace it and let the good times roll.",8,1,3,8 December 2017
Liar Liar," Jim Carrey The GOAT
","In my opinion, this is one of the funniest movies of all-time. Period.
Jim Carrey literally carries the entire film, even though there are some great little performances scattered throughout as well. Jerry is perfect. Carrey does such a magnificent job with his humor, that you sometimes forget he is acting here. His love for Max is apparent, as are his horrible tendencies as a human being. By the end of the film, you are rooting for him the entire way. It's also one of the most quotable comedies ever. 'Yeah, in your bra!' The list goes on and on and on but do yourself a favor and grab a cold six pack and sit back and have some fun with this one. You'll be in tears laughing soon enough.",8,0,1,24 January 2018
Mulholland Drive," A masterpiece that I'll never truly understand
","I'll start things off by saying that my mom would hate this movie. It's confusing, it doesn't follow a traditional storyline, characters come and go, it's scary as hell, and the ending leaves you feeling extremely out of sorts. There are loose ends that never connect and when watching movies with my parents throughout the years, they don't enjoy films that don't have a definitive 'meaning' they can explain to themselves...and others.Mulholland Drive definitely doesn't have an ending you can explain. Well, some people can (or attempt to), but Lynch made this film under his direction, his vision and his own meanings that we will probably never know or understand.Just know this, do not go into Mulholland Drive expecting anything that you know from movies you've seen throughout the years. It will bend every expectation, trope, and stereotype you've ever seen on film. That's all I can really say. You'll contrive your own meanings from it. I think Lynch knows this too. He has this fascination with human curiosity and his pure genius comes from the fact that he can create a mystery film that ends with more mystery than it began with. If you do a Google or Youtube search on this film, you will see countless theories, threads, forums, and opinions on what it means and how certain scenes connect (or don't) to one another. Just give it a watch and find out for yourself. You may like it, you may hate it. But, I don't think you'll ever stop thinking about it, and that is the true importance here.",9,2,2,7 December 2017
The Dark Knight," I'll never forget where I was
","The first time I saw The Dark Knight in theaters, I was the DD for a group of drunk friends back in my high school days. To say my first experience with this film was underwhelming is quite the understatement. I left the packed theater feeling disappointed and annoyed with my buzzed peers.A few years later, I had the opportunity to see all three Batman movies in a row the night of The Dark Knight Rises premiere. It was my second day working in my first job out of college, and a bunch of us decided to buy tickets together. Because the theater was so packed, I was located in the dead center of the front row. I hadn't sat that close in years. When Batman Begins ended with the Joker card being revealed, I knew I was finally in to experience this movie the right way. An hour passed between films, and we all took our seats for the beginning of The Dark Knight.From the onset, I was absolutely HOOKED. Christopher Nolan decided to take a page out of Michael Mann's book and created an atmosphere in The Dark Knight that wasn't merely a superhero movie, but a crime thriller with intricate characters, decisions, emotions, action scenes and struggles. Does this movie has some flaws? Absolutely. Humans made it so that is always to be assumed. However, the positives greatly outweigh the negatives (always thought the Joker ship scene was strange and Gyllenhaal as Rachel was meh) and we were left with an absolutely stunning peace of cinema.It's hard not to watch this movie every time it comes on TNT (they love this movie and Saving Private Ryan) because it just has this ability to completely draw you in. Watching Heath Ledger take on the Joker from the front row was an experience I will truly never forget. I guess because I never really grew up reading the comics, I wasn't too worried how closely he portrayed any Jokers in those, and I thought his take on this villain was completely amazing. I can't imagine what it was like behind-the- scenes with him and Nolan working their magic. It is truly a joy to watch. It is so sad his life ended so early and we didn't get to see more from him in his young, budding career and life. Also, the ending of this film leaves me with goosebumps every single time and is the perfect lead into The Dark Knight Rises. Which stinks. But that's okay because I'm not writing about that movie, I'm writing about the epic that is The Dark Knight. So, do yourself a favor and watch this movie on a great TV with great speakers and immerse yourself in the cinematic experience. Turn your phone off, quit texting and checking Instagram and really WATCH what happens. There is much more going on here than you think. Batman and Joker set the bar for a superhero and villain combination that will be hard to top, and I'm not sure that any film ever will. The interrogation scene is perfect, as is the car chase scene (aside from some really terrible dialogue from the movie cops), the hospital scene and the very end of the film. You're in for a treat with this one.",9,0,0,7 December 2017
Scream," Truly Visceral and Disturbing
","I re-watched Scream last night with my girlfriend for the first time in a couple of years. She had just watched Scary Movie the night before with her roommate and had a scary movie in mind for the both of us to watch together. Before viewing, I could tell that she didn't remember much about Scream and the fact that it is actually a scary slasher movie. I couldn't wait to see her reactions.From the onset, the opening scene with Drew Barrymore is still one of the best in horror/film history. It's absolutely terrifying. The music? 10/10. The cinematography? 10/10. Writing? 10/10. Suspense? 10/10. Hitchcock elements? 10/10. It hits on all cylinders and then some. When Barrymore's character is attempting to scream for her parents in front of a tilted, uneasy camera, with the killer right behind her...that is horror movie magic right there. Now, don't get me wrong. Scream is a brutal film. That opening scene could emotionally scar you, especially if you are a young woman in this world. That said, Scream plays on itself and other horror movies throughout, and plays the exact same game that the killer plays with his victims, with its audience. Horror movie tropes are a real thing, just like action movie tropes and romantic comedy tropes and suspenseful film tropes and cliches. The list goes on and on. I always find it funny when people think horror movies are the only films with these scores and scenes that can be predictable for the audience. How about Tom Cruise hanging out of a car door 565 feet in the air with machine guns firing at him, a beautiful woman by his side, and the fate of the world in his hands? Yeah...I think you get my point.What Scream does so well is relish in its self-awareness and then some. As I watched the movie a second and third time, it's so blatantly obvious who the killer is, it's hard to believe I ever thought that was the point of the film in the first place. Yet, there is still a twist. Just like in Pyscho, we know something is off about Norman Bates, yet we don't know the entirety of it. We're just scratching the surface. Now, does Scream have its faults? Sure. I'm not really going to dwell on them. From the tilted camera and quick zooms used in the film, I felt uneasy and slightly off throughout. Wes Craven has a way of making you feel uncomfortable just like he did with Freddy. The killer is a bit clumsy...but when you watch Nightmare on Elm Street, so was Freddy. He knows how to ride that line so well. The last few scenes are also pretty disturbing to watch, but with the music and the strange acting and horror movie games and cliches, it's just bloody fun. So many movies copied Scream that it can be hard to take it serious at times. When I tried to explain to my girlfriend that they are self-aware in their horror movie cliches and rules, she didn't seem to agree with me. 'It's just being a horror movie.' Which is true. It is. But, it's also playing on itself and so many that came before it, and now, so many that came after it. I can't imagine reading the script for Scream (originally titled Scary Movie). It is seal-vacuum tight. I am a firm believer in catching the viewer from the opening scene and with no cuts for the first 10-15 minutes, I was on the edge of my frickin' seat! Isn't that the joy in seeing a movie in the first place? I can't imagine seeing this in theaters and I hope it is re-released soon. It would be worth a visit to see on the big screen.",9,0,0,30 January 2018
Mother!," Whoa
","I saw Mother! in theaters by myself on a Monday night after work. I had read some reviews and hot takes and decided to go see it for myself. First, let's just get this out of the way. Mother! is completely insane. Extreme close-ups, claustrophobia, awkward scenes, intense acting, violence, greed, narcissism and more fill the film and you're not quite sure how to react.Second, Michelle Pfeiffer is an amazing actress. She is truly deplorable as a person in this film and it is perfect. She'll drive you absolutely crazy and you'll wonder why Lawrence's character doesn't just sock her in the face. But, I think that is part of the point here. That said, I can see why many people despised this film. It's in-your-face, strange, intense, vile and so much more. Watching it alone was a great choice because I didn't have to answer to anyone or give my response to the film based on their reaction to it. We've all been guilty of that before, I think. Overall, I liked the movie. It will offend you. It will make you squirm. It will make you ask what the heck is going on. It will make you question things. It will tick you off. But, plenty of events in my life have created these reactions and I've either learned from them, questioned them, moved on, or never let certain experiences go. That's a little how I feel about Mother! You'll probably never forget when you saw it (good or bad), how it made you feel, and the anger, frustration or confusion it invoked. Or, you'll just completely forget about it forever and wish you had never seen it. Enjoy! :)",7,0,4,7 December 2017
A Nightmare on Elm Street," It deserves its rightful place in horror movie history
","Aside from its clunky ending, A Nightmare on Elm Street is my favorite horror movie of all-time. For starters, Freddy Krueger does not discriminate, and he will haunt your dreams no matter your age. Aside from Alien's 'In Space, No One Can Hear You Scream,' 'Don't Fall Asleep' is the second-best horror movie catchphrase of all- time.After Friday the 13th and the 80s slashers took the scene, Wes Craven came through with a whole different evil villain in Freddy Krueger, a former child murderer that kills kids in their dreams. I'm sorry, what?He got the idea from a string of stories ran in the LA Times about a young child that had survived the field killings in Cambodia. After a slew of nightmares, the young boy was found dead in his house after dying in his sleep. The police found a coffee pot in his closet with an extension cord running up under his bed and plugged into the wall. He obviously didn't want to fall asleep either. Craven ran with the story and created the most heinous, vile monster in horror movie history. With some Hitchcock elements spun throughout, A Nightmare on Elm Street is a fantastic ride from start to (almost) finish. The mood, music, atmosphere, shots, effects, blood, kills, and nightmares are all perfect. There are a few scenes that you watch and say 'Wow, that's a classic cinema shot,' or 'Holy hell that's terrifying'. Some scenes make you feel like Freddy Krueger is actually out there waiting for you to fall asleep tonight.Heather Langenkamp, aka Nancy Thompson in the film, works perfectly here. All of the characters do really. There are some missed opportunities, sure, but it all works out and there are times throughout the film where you feel trapped inside a boiler room, a terrible nightmare or a dangerous place and think, 'Is this really happening to me?' The ending is a bit clunky and takes the fear away a bit, but I also think that is part of the point. As Nancy fights back and becomes the ultimate bad-a#$, Krueger becomes less and less of a threat. Facing your fears is difficult, but Nancy shows us the courage and tenacity it takes to destroy an evil entity like Freddy Krueger. Or, does she?",8,3,4,8 December 2017
