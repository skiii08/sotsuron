Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Watch it with the sound down
","I will skip a plot summary since the story of this movie is common knowledge.I enjoyed every minute of this film so long as the characters weren't talking.  George Lucas' dialogue is absolutely horrible to listen to. Almost every word is forced, strained, and unnatural.  The pod race scene (OK, so it was lifted from BEN HUR, it was still well executed and exciting) is enjoyable for every minute, except for the intrusions of the announcer's voice.  The voyage through the liquid interior of the planet is edge-of-your-seat suspense, but the scene is badly damaged by Jar-Jar's droning chatter.  By far the best scene in the movie, almost worth the price of admission by itself, is a climactic three-way lightsaber duel, whose effectiveness is due in large part to the fact that it has no dialogue.  The initial appearance of the city-planet of Coruscant is breathtaking.  It is no accident that Darth Maul is almost everybody's favorite character (including mine); it is because he has almost no lines.Nor is the script Lucas' only failure.  I was shocked at first by the low quality of John Williams' score.  I was wondering, can this be the same man who composed the vivacious, ringing melodies of A NEW HOPE, THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, SUPERMAN and RAIDERS OF  THE LOST ARK, or brought us the mournful violin strains of SCHINDLER'S LIST?  Then, when the end credits rolled and I heard the whole theme, I realized that the music wasn't as bad as I had thought; Lucas had just taken the very worst parts of it and used them to score the whole movie.  The only scene where the music works at all is the aforementioned lightsaber duel, where the eerie vocals add a great ambience.  Lucas also sabotages a climactic land battle scene; the view of massive troop carriers disgorging vast numbers of battle droids marching in lockstep generates no fear or awe, because Lucas has spent the first half of the movie making the battle droids look hopelessly stupid, inept, and amusing.The acting is mostly disappointing, probably because of the poor script. Liam Neeson, normally an outstanding actor, just sleepwalks through his lines as Qui-Gon.  Nathalie Portman gives a schizophrenic performance.  As 'Queen Amidala' she is pretty good, letting about the right amount of worry and fear for her people seep through her air of calm command.  But as 'Padme,' she is unbearably wooden; her scenes with young Anakin will make you cringe.  Ewan McGregor's Obi-Wan is simply boring.  Jake Lloyd is better than reported as Anakin, but still no great shakes.  Ian McDarmid is good as Senator Palpatine, and of course Ray Park is commendably menacing as Darth Maul.  There is no point in my heaping further excoriation on Jar-Jar Binks.I have no problem with escapist action movies: RAIDERS, the original STAR WARS, DIE HARD and the like are among my favorites.  Every minute of THE PHANTOM MENACE that involves lightsabers in people's hands is enjoyable. Every minute that lacks action is just boring.  And every minute you hear the characters mouthing their stilted, artificial lines is just plain painful.  Just rent it, ignore the non-action parts, and settle down for a nice few hours of Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan and Darth Maul beating the hell out of everything in their path.  And don't turn the sound up except for that cool three-way lightsaber battle.Rating:  ** out of ****.",6,0,1,24 August 1999
Casablanca," For all-around entertainment, the best I've ever seen
","CASABLANCA is the best treatment ever of the ancient theme of the love triangle.  Set in World War II Casablanca, a Moroccan city under the control of the collaborationist Vichy French government, the movie starts with a news wire that two German couriers have been murdered and their letters of transit stolen.  Each letter will permit one person to leave Casablanca to a neutral country.Enter Humphrey Bogart as Rick Blaine, owner of the shady but cheerful Cafe Americaine.  Rick is a cynical and hard-nosed man whose motto is, 'I stick my neck out for nobody.'  Like many a cynic, Rick is an embittered ex-idealist, still nursing his wounds from being abandoned by his lover Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman).  By chance he falls into possession of the missing letters of transit.Enter Ilsa, who comes to Casablanca on the arm of Czech Resistance leader Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid), a few steps ahead of the Nazi police.  We now have three people and two letters of transit.  Who will reach America, and who will stay in Casablanca?I know no other movie that so perfectly balances humor, romance, and drama. The soul of good drama lies in presenting characters with hard choices, and few choices are as hard, or as illuminating of the protagonists' makeup, as the choices in CASABLANCA.  All of the characters must decide what they will give up for love, for honor, and for themselves.  The scenes of Rick and Ilsa's love, years ago in Paris, are some of the finest romantic scenes in cinema.  And the humor, particularly in the person of Casablanca's Prefect of Police, Louis Renault, has contributed dozens of dry witticisms to our everyday language - 'I am shocked! Shocked! - 'The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.' - 'I was misinformed.' - 'It would take a miracle to get you out of Casablanca, and the Germans have outlawed miracles.'  So perfectly blended are these three major elements that you cannot point to a single shot or scene that should have been eliminated from the movie.  Never try to watch only one scene from CASABLANCA; you will inevitably be absorbed until the very end of the film.  It is little short of miraculous that the chaotically mismanaged shooting of this movie resulted in such a magnificent final product; it speaks volumes for luck and for Owen Marks' and Michael Curtiz' post-production editing.I have never encountered a movie whose supporting cast was so perfectly realized.  Every minor character is a fleshed-out, realistic individual, from Sasha to Carl the headwaiter to Rick's competitor Ferrari to the self-effacing criminal Ugarte.  Claude Rains' Captain Renault ('I'm only a poor corrupt official') steals scene after scene, and Dooley Wilson's Sam is a refreshingly loyal, charismatic and sympathetic conception from an era when almost all black characters were rendered as demeaning stereotypes. The only character who tastes of the cliche is the villainous Major Strasser, which can be forgiven in a wartime production.The only film I have ever seen as tautly effective as CASABLANCA is GLORY. Although the 54th Mass.'s story is arguably superior even to CASABLANCA for sheer dramatic power and acting talent, GLORY lacks CASABLANCA's wonderful humor and romance, which causes me to give the edge to Curtiz' classic as the better-rounded movie.  I have yet to see CASABLANCA surpassed.Rating: **** out of ****.",10,80,100,27 August 1999
G.I. Jane," Sloppy but good-hearted movie
","(Minor spoilers).G.I. JANE is the story of Jordan O'Neil (Demi Moore), who is selected to become the first woman to undertake combat training with the Navy SEALs. It is intended that, if she is successful, Congress will debate opening combat roles in the military to women. O'Neil must face the hellish rigors of the training, administered harshly and meticulously by master Chief Urgayle (Viggo Mortensen), as well as overcoming the hostility and uncooperativeness of her fellow trainees, and the political machinations of the Senator who selected her.The plot of G.I. JANE is a lamentable mess. At one point, O'Neil takes the irrevocable step of resigning from the program, only to promptly be let back in and allowed to continue. What? The sequences of the SERE island training are simply absurd; no trainees could take that amount of punishment without being hospitalized for weeks with multiple fractures. And there is the oh-so-predictable, oh-so-stupid gimmick of dropping the trainees into actual combat at the end.There is also the question of the realism of O'Neil's success. I will not deny that there are women who could make it through combat training; it's been done, in other countries and times. But it's a fact that such women are very rare exceptions to the rule. And G.I. JANE makes it quite clear that Senator DeHaven has passed over the best-qualified female candidates and selected O'Neil, a comm officer, principally for her appearance rather than her physical abilities. I just can't believe that any woman less than the very best in the field could pass SEAL training, when the program eliminates nearly half of the men who take it on.But G.I. JANE recovers in heart what it lacks in brains. O'Neil's determination to be treated as an equal, even when that treatment isn't nice, is laudable. The symbol of this attitude, of course, is how she shaves her head. But it is present everywhere else in the movie; she refuses special privileges, objects to an aide in the obstacle course, and even sleeps in the men's barracks. In a world where whiny feminists use unequal treatment as an excuse and a crutch to be discarded when no longer convenient, O'Neil insists on truly equal treatment, and I have to admire her for it.However, the movie's treatment of the issues surrounding women in the military is very simplistic and deceptive. At one point, when Urgayle points out that men will unreasonably endanger themselves to save women in combat, thus risking their units, O'Neil dismissively responds that if you save a man, you're a hero, but if you save a woman, you're taking an unjustified risk. This is not true, as those who've seen SAVING PRIVATE RYAN or FULL METAL JACKET should realize; both movies show how soldiers are sometimes forced to let a sniper's victim die alone because going out to rescue him will merely get other men shot too. I'm not saying the problem is insoluble; after all, much of military discipline consists of training people to ignore such natural instincts as running like hell. But complex problems such as Urgayle raises will not go away merely because they are ignored. At the same time, the movie ignores what I always felt was the strongest argument in favor of women in combat: the historical instances where women fought successfully on the winning side in World War II, Vietnam, and the Israeli revolution, among others.Demi Moore will never be a great actress, but she successfully shows O'Neil's fiery determination. Viggo Mortensen does a virtuoso job as Urgayle, though the ambiguous writing of his part makes it seem sometimes that he is playing two different men. Mortensen is one of the few actors who can play nearly any role he is handed; what two more different characters can you imagine than Urgayle in this movie and Weps in CRIMSON TIDE? Anne Bancroft is so good at impersonating ex-Texas governor Ann Richards that I didn't mind the fact that her part was a laughable stick-figure villain. Trevor Jones' suspense-building score is the only thing that makes the last scenes bearable.G.I. JANE is entertaining, and it at least tries to put out serious thoughts for consideration, even if it isn't very good at it. Give it a look sometime.Rating: **1/2 out of ****.",6,0,1,8 September 1999
The 13th Warrior," Sloppy and illogical, but sometimes entertaining
","How do you mess up a plot as simple as THE 13th WARRIOR's?  This is the story of Ahmed ibn Fahdalan (Antonio Banderas), whom the Abbassid caliph appoints as ambassador to the Northmen (interestingly, I don't recall the word `Viking' ever being used in this movie).  The Vikings dragoon him into service against a mysterious tribe of creatures that are attacking the Vikings' villages and eating the flesh of the slain.Screenwriters William Wisher and Warren Lewis competed with each other to see how many holes they could fit in a plot this small; I won't blame Michael Crichton since I haven't read his book.  The foremost absurdity is that we are supposed to believe that just 13 Vikings turned the tide of battle against this strange tribe of hundreds of creatures, even though the king's village has hardly `a man between fifteen and fifty' besides them.  The concept that this tribe can be defeated merely by killing two of its biggest and strongest members is the invention of someone who has only a video-game understanding of war. Ahmed, appointed as an ambassador, never once attempts any diplomatic function; the minute the fighting is over he turns around and goes home!  He also goes from being a poet unskilled with weapons to Zorro-like derring-do in no time flat, without even being trained.  A subplot involving the local king's son leads to a tedious duel scene and then goes nowhere.  The many smaller holes are too numerous to list.Almost lost in the mangled storyline is some very interesting speculation on the origin of medieval myth and superstition.  When the human-flesh-eating beast-men attack, and are beaten off, the bodies of their dead disappear.  Presumably the beast-men carried them off to eat, but to the Vikings demonism seems as logical an explanation as any.  A gigantic fiery snake winds its way down a mountain toward the Viking village.  This turns out to be a column of hundreds of mounted enemies carrying torches, but how many of the women and children who hid in cellars during the battle passed the tale of the fiery `dragon' down to the next generation?  And it's not hard to see the origin of the Beowulf myth in the confrontation with the beast-man tribe's mother priestess in a cave below the earth.Except for Ahmed and one of the Vikings named Herger, the characters are all cardboard.  I was not the only viewer who couldn't keep the twelve Viking warriors straight or attach names to them.  A love interest character named Olga, played by the beautiful Maria Bonnevie, is so poorly drawn that she should have been left out altogether.
The acting is a mixed bag.  I like Banderas; it takes a hell of a lot of guts for a man who makes his living as a sex symbol to take on an explicitly homosexual role, which Banderas did and did well a few years back in PHILADELPHIA.  But he's just not very good in THE 13TH WARRIOR.  His voice is exactly the same as in THE MASK OF ZORRO and doesn't sound the slightest bit Arabic.  He is given several dramatic one-liners that he flubs badly.  But he is good at simulating pain, and gives a good sense of stumbling over the words of the unfamiliar Norse language.  Dennis Storhoi as Herger does by far the best job.  He's a heck of a lot of ferociousness and scrappiness in a small package, and his face reminds me of a young Liam Neeson.  Vladimir Kulich has been wildly overrated as Buliwyf; the man never once changes his facial expression or tone of voice.  Schwarzenegger's Conan was Olivier by comparison.  Daniel Southern, playing Eadgtho impressed me with his screen presence, though his accent needed work.  Sven Wollter's King Hrothgar is lethargic and boring.The soul of this film, of course, is its action scenes, and they are good, though sometimes confusing.  The pace of the battles never lets up; they're savage and immediate.  Firelight is well used to evoke the primitivism of the battlefield.THE 13TH WARRIOR does a pretty good job of evoking the atmosphere of early medieval Scandinavia.  There's not a paved road in sight; the roughness and uncouthness of the Vikings and their home is well painted, if maybe a bit overdone at first.  Banderas ' prayer before the final battle is as superb a portrayal of the spirit of the medieval warrior as has ever appeared on screen. The Viking swords look like authentic museum reproductions.  But why are there no battle-axes? Swords were rich men's weapons; to make a Viking movie with no axes is almost sacrilegious. Some of the armor looks suspiciously like 16th-century Spanish breastplate-and-morion gear. Also, British Columbia is a bit verdant to pass for northern Scandinavia.The production values are as good as $100 million can buy.  Jerry Goldsmith's score is enjoyable as always, but it's not one of his greater works.  McTiernan sometimes applies the music poorly, allowing it to stop abruptly where it should have faded out.  Unlike many action movies, this one does not have the humor laid on too thick.  Banderas has an awful slapstick scene, but I enjoyed the chagrined swordsmith's line, `He insisted,' upon seeing his sword carved into a scimitar.I was mildly entertained by THE 13TH WARRIOR, but would recommend it only to genre fans, for whom the rich atmosphere and action scenes may outweigh the illogical plot and poor characterization.  If you see it at all, see it on the wide screen.Rating: ** out of ****.",5,0,0,9 November 1999
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," An absurd story, but a fine movie
","Contrary to some reports, Pirates of the Caribbean is not a movie about a band of pirates seeking to raise an Aztec curse by some mumbo-jumbo ritual, or the heroic rescue of a beautiful maiden who has fallen into the cursed pirates' hands.  Oh yes, the cursed pirates, the Aztec ritual, the rescue and all that rubbish are IN the movie.  But, fortunately, they're not what the movie is about.  Pirates of the Caribbean is really about white canvas sails and creaking cedar hulls, gleaming cutlasses and flintlock pistols, sailors' tattoos and golden earrings, sun-spattered islets and towering Caribbean cliffs, moonlit seas and driving storms.  It is not about any particular pirates, but about the aura of pirates, their atmosphere.  And if you love the pirate aura, as I do, you'll forgive the picture the preposterousness that it wears on its sleeve.The best thing about Pirates of the Caribbean is that the actors and the crew show real love and affection for the screwy B-movie they are making. Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, and Geoffrey Rush all look like they're having fun, and director Gore Verbinski's shots look like he loves watching the scenes he's making, lingering on the pirates and the ships and the islands instead of hustling them on and off.  This movie is much better than such dreck as Die Another Day, not because it's any smarter, but because it lacks the air of cynicism, of contempt for itself and its audience that mars productions like Tamahori's.  Die Another Day was made by people who didn't care a flying fig for espionage or intrigue; Pirates of the Caribbean was made by people who loved piracy, adventure and the sea.  The scene where Captain Sparrow finally swings aboard, caresses the ship's wheel like a long-lost lover, and murmurs, 'Bring me that horizon,' is inconceivable in a typical heartless summer blockbuster; most action filmmakers wouldn't be caught dead expressing such embarrassingly sincere emotion.This is not to say that Pirates of the Caribbean deserves comparison with the handful of real classics that have also been summer blockbusters, such as Raiders of the Lost Ark or Star Wars.  Those movies had stories; Pirates of the Caribbean has a muddle that passes for a story.  Just because Verbinski's movie is better than the average summer fare we get nowadays does not mean that it's great art, or even good art.  But unlike most movies about which people say, 'Don't think about it, just have fun,' Pirates of the Caribbean actually IS fun.Rating: **½ out of ****.Recommendation: Lovers of pirates and the sea must catch this one in the theater, but others can wait for video.",Null,0,1,16 September 2003
Troy," Good and original, unfortunately
","This movie is named 'Troy.' It is not named 'The Iliad.' Troy was a real place, and the Greeks really did besiege it and destroy it. The Iliad is a work of fiction written some centuries after the fall of Troy by a guy named Homer, who guessed at what happened based on the chants and oral histories handed down to him. The movie Troy is not an attempt to recreate the Iliad word for word; it is an attempt to show the kind of real events that might have given rise to the myths retold in the Iliad So it is no crime that the movie leaves out much of the Iliad. The problem is that the new inventions that substitute for the Iliad's version often didn't work. To paraphrase Samuel Johnson, Troy is both good and original, but the part that is good is not original, and the part that is original is not good.To review the good part: as in the Iliad, Hector is the most noble and impressive character in the story. In fact, he's even nobler here than in the Iliad, as he faces Achilles down directly, while Homer's Hector understandably but ingloriously flees the Greek champion for as long as he can. Eric Bana does the role justice, showing his devotion to his family and his city, and there is a streak of true Greek tragedy in how his love for the one destroys the other.On paper, Brad Pitt looks like a disastrous choice to play Achilles, so I'm pleased to say he did a fine job. He does very well in his scene with Priam, and he manages to convey with his tears over the body of Hector that he has finally realized that the man he has killed and whose corpse he has desecrated was a better man than he. Also, the movie comes up with a fairly imaginative explanation of how Achilles got his reputation for invulnerability to mortal weapons.Peter O'Toole, meanwhile, gives a radically different performance from his customary acting, investing Priam with far more dignity and majesty than he usually gets. It's delightful to see O'Toole still willing to strike out in a new direction at his age.I'm sorry, but that's it for the good part. The bad choices are overwhelming.To start with, making Agamemnon into a villain was a perfectly defensible decision, but making him into an incompetent was not. It is impossible to believe that a man like Brian Cox's Agamemnon could have united Greece despite lacking not only scruple but also courage, foresight, diplomatic skill, and military prowess. The pious complaints that kings don't fight, but let their underlings die for them is an almost charmingly clueless modernism: from ancient Greece to the Middle Ages, personal skill at arms and tactical mastery were the qualities most demanded of a king, and kings who lacked those qualities were usually deposed and killed by kings who had them.The second major failure is that the movie wants us to like Achilles, and I left the theater wishing that Briseis had cut his throat when she had the chance. Then Hector would have lived, and possibly Troy would have been saved. And what, precisely, would have been lost by Achilles' death? A talented killer whose only motivation for killing is so that generations untold will sing of his butcheries. Who is worse: Agamemnon, who slaughters people who did him no harm in order to unite warring nations under his rule, or Achilles, who also slaughters people who did him no harm, but does it only to make a name for himself in the epics? Achilles gives a high-falutin' final speech to Briseis, saying 'you brought me peace,' but what exactly did she do to bring him 'peace' that the woman he slept with in the opening scene didn't do too? It would be easier to like Achilles if there were at least some justice to the Greeks' cause; if, for instance, Paris had been the sniveling coward he was in the original text, or had kidnapped Helen, and if Menelaus had really been in love with her. But in this version, Paris is doing Helen a favor, Menelaus is fighting not for love of his wife but for his wounded pride, and Paris bravely (if incompetently) challenges Menelaus to single combat. Who can possibly want the Greeks to win? Rating: **1/2 out of ****.Recommendation: See it on TV.",5,2,5,14 August 2007
L.A. Confidential," Three of the best performances you'll ever see
","L.A. CONFIDENTIAL is the story of three policemen, Ed Exley, Bud White, and Jack Vincennes, who are involved from different angles in a purge of the police force following a vicious jailhouse beating.  One of the purged policemen is later found dead in the Nite Owl Cafe, one of six victims of a brutal shooting massacre.  Their investigations uncover a rape, a call girl ring, a police corruption scandal, and more other stuff than I can remember right now.In a typical cop movie, you're lucky to find one interesting character. L.A. CONFIDENTIAL has three leads, all of whom are fascinating.  Never have I seen three men who so finely tread the line between good and evil.Ed Exley, magnificently realized by Guy Pearce, is a wholesome, bespectacled young man of seemingly iron-clad integrity.  When he tells Captain Smith he wants to be a detective, a revealing exchange occurs.  Smith: 'Would you shoot a guilty man in the back to keep a jury from acquitting him?'  Exley: 'No.'  Smith: 'Would you plant evidence on a man you knew was guilty to keep him from walking?'  Exley: 'No.'  Smith: 'Then for God's sake, don't be a detective.'  And Exley is as competent as he is honest, which we learn during a brilliant interrogation scene.  But he is also overweeningly ambitious, and it becomes increasingly unclear whether, or how much, his actions are motivated by his principles or by his desire to get ahead.  At the end, it appears that he has made a final choice between his career and his moral values . . . but he's fooled us, and his character remains tantalizingly ambiguous.  Like Crowe, Pearce is Australian, but not even the slightest hint of an Aussie twang ever passes his lips; he is utterly convincing playing an American.Russell Crowe was unjustly passed over by the Academy, failing even to garner a nomination for his wonderful performance as Bud White.  White is a hard and violent man, for whom justice is everything, and let the law go screw itself.  At times he appears simply to be a thug, as he calmly beats a tied and helpless suspect black and blue as if it were just another day at the office.  At others, he is a virtual white knight, risking both his life and his professional career to rescue women who are being beaten by abusive husbands or pimps (and to administer harsh street justice to their abusers). And some of his actions are in between.  Crowe delivers White's lines in a terse monotone, always suggesting tension underneath.  He does most of his acting with his face and hands; the sharp spasmodic nods and the puckering of his brow always hinting at violence kept under tight control.  When he does lose control, he is terrifying, like a raw amoral force of nature. While some will automatically condemn White with the happy homily, 'We mustn't take the law into our own hands,' other viewers will admire him for his willingness to take responsibility for his own actions rather than hiding behind 'the law' or 'the system' which ultimately consists of people no better than he.Then there is Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey), a man who no longer takes either the law or justice seriously, and is now the technical advisor to the trash show 'Hush Hush' first and a cop second.  However, as the movie progresses, we can tell that he is becoming bored and dissatisfied with his life.  He's forgotten why he joined the force, but he would like to remember.  'I doubt you've ever taken a stupid breath,' Cap. Smith tells Vincennes, and we agree, but we also sense that he's taken damn few happy ones.  Spacey's acting just keeps getting better.  In most of his scenes, it's hard to believe that he's reciting scripted lines; he looks and sounds exactly as if he is making words up on the spot, just like people do in real life.So given these three magnificently drawn characters, rendered by three outstanding actors, why is my IMDb vote for this movie only an 8 rather than a 10?  Because of the plot.  The same movie with the same story could have been made with three completely different characters, and still been believable.  It's not that the story is actually bad; it's one of the most complex mysteries since THE BIG SLEEP, fairly original, and some of the plot twists are downright shocking.  But it fails to give us the sense that 'character is destiny' as the truly great dramas do; the same things could have happened to anybody else.  L.A. CONFIDENTIAL is ultimately a routine detective movie that happens to have some of the best acting and characterization ever seen on the silver screen.As a side note, I believe L.A. CONFIDENTIAL was very poorly served by its marketing.  The trailer, posters and title all suggest a trashy and lurid movie, told entirely from the perspective of Sid Hudgeons, Danny DeVito's sleazemongering tabloid king.  There wasn't a hint of the gem that was inside.  That's why I ended up seeing it on video, instead of in the theater as it deserved.Rating: *** out of ****.",8,0,1,9 September 1999
Glory," Simply the finest war movie ever made.
","Edward Zwick brings us the story of the 54th Massachusetts Regiment, the first regiment of the Civil War comprised entirely of black volunteers. The story centers around a group of black soldiers.  There's Trip, a cynical, bitter runaway slave (Denzel Washington); Rawlins, a wise and compassionate grave-digger who can no longer stand aside and watch others die to save his people (Morgan Freeman); Sharts, a devoted and naive young sharpshooter (Jihmi Kennedy); and Thomas, a well-educated free Northerner who in his own way is no less naive than Sharts (Andre Braugher).  All will grow and change in the course of the movie.  Col. Shaw (Matthew Broderick) is the white commander of the regiment who must win the trust of men who have known nothing but contempt and hatred from whites, while simultaneously putting them through the often-cruel process of training for battle.There are two movies that, even if I walk into them in the middle, will immediately glue me to the screen until the very end.  One is CASABLANCA. The other is GLORY.  This movie is pure drama without an ounce of fat on it. There's not a single shot, much less a single scene, that should have been edited out.Any discussion of GLORY must begin with Denzel Washington.  Arguably the greatest American actor living today, Washington has yet to surpass his astonishing performance as Trip.  Washington's role calls for a wide variety of emotions, all of which he delivers outstandingly: hatred and sourness that he cannot resist spilling onto his fellow soldiers, defiance and determination in the incredibly powerful scene where he is disciplined for desertion, an embarrassed affection as he realizes, and confesses, that his comrades mean the world to him.  Washington's Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor was hardly reward enough; the Academy could have renamed the award in his honor.Morgan Freeman is dignified and reserved throughout, as he transforms from bystander in the war to the leader-by-acclaim and the surrogate father of the troops.  His confrontation with Washington is classic.  Andre Braugher evokes great sympathy as, due to his comfortable upbringing, he suffers much worse than his fellows from the hardships of soldiering, yet refuses to give up.  Matthew Broderick, normally a mediocre actor at best, gives a sterling performance; one scene, where he takes the regiment in five seconds from the verge of mutiny to being ready to follow him through hell, should be shown in every ROTC course on military leadership.But GLORY is not a mere feel-good piece of sugar candy like, say, A TIME TO KILL.  These characters we come to know and love have to fight a very dirty, nasty, bloody war, and GLORY does not flinch from showing it to us.  War does not play favorites with our favorite characters.  Nor is the Union side portrayed as angelically just.  Indeed, most of the racism that the men of the 54th Mass. must endure comes from their bigoted fellow Union soldiers, and Shaw's superiors are realistically shown as corrupt and indifferent to the welfare of their subordinates.It is an interesting irony that Washington went on to play Spike Lee's Malcolm X, where he famously declares to his fellow black people, 'We are not Americans!'  Having seen GLORY, and having gained some understanding of how bitter was the sacrifice, how bloody the price, that the men of the 54th Mass. paid to win themselves and their fellows the rights that Americans today take for granted, one hopes that fewer Americans of any race will agree with the jaded view of the great civil rights leader.  As a paean to the courage of those who would rather die free than live as slaves, GLORY surpasses even BRAVEHEART, due to GLORY's superior acting and far greater historical accuracy.  Zwick, Washington, Freeman and Broderick have given us a true classic.",10,0,1,20 August 1999
Forrest Gump," Shallow, frequently offensive movie somewhat redeemed by Hanks and Sinise
","FORREST GUMP is a vaguely picaresque story of a mentally retarded but good-hearted fellow who grows up during the 1960s and 1970s, serving in the Vietnam conflict, running a shrimping trawler, and pursuing a very unlovable childhood sweetheart.  He has no control over his life, but is not smart enough to realize it or care.  Gary Sinise co-stars as Lt. Dan Taylor, Gump's ex-C.O. who follows him around after the war like an albatross hung around his neck.It's been five years since I saw this movie, but I still remember how it annoyed me, chiefly by appealing to the basest, most jaded parts of the viewers' personalities.  The worst instance was when Forrest Gump tells the audience that his sweetheart Jenny's father loves her a lot, always hugging and kissing her.  In my theater, a raucous, cynical snicker rippled through the audience at that line; we are intended to conclude from that statement that Jenny's father is sexually abusing her, and Zemeckis later confirms this leap to a sick conclusion.  It is a truly sad commentary both on the entertainment industry and on the viewing public at large that the very concept of fatherhood today is so disrespected that for a father to hug and kiss his daughter is taken per se as a sign of sexual abuse.Jenny's character is so despicable that Gump's love for her is inexplicable. Perhaps it is intended as an example of really 'unconditional' love, and shows what a sorry thing that kind of love is, much like the wife who clings to an abusive husband no matter what he does to her.  Her character hits rock bottom when, having abandoned Gump like a used-up tissue and taken his child from him without even informing him, Jenny refuses even to apologize to him because she was 'messed up.'  Gump swallows this excuse with stomach-turning ease.Now I don't want to launch into some Pat-Robertson-like tirade on the decline of American morality.  American morality is better today than in the past in many ways.  Racial hatred has gone from being an accepted norm to being absolutely intolerable.  Rape is blamed on the victim less frequently than in bygone days.  Sexual double standards are being abandoned. Religious tolerance and inter-faith amity are on the upswing.  But in some other ways, American morality is deteriorating, and this one excuse, 'I was messed up,' is perhaps the best example.  Every kind of barbarism, from Jenny's cruel and heartless manipulation of Gump up to and including cold-blooded murder, is now excused with the phrase 'I was messed up,' followed by an endless litany of the wrongdoer's misfortunes.  FORREST GUMP wantonly tries to widen this tear in the fabric of the viewers' moral thought.  I'm not buying into it.  Being 'messed up' may excuse viciousness against the person who messed you up; it should never be allowed to justify hurting innocent people.The movie's exploitation of the mentally handicapped for cheap laughs is also tasteless and vulgar (and yes, I will shamefacedly admit, I laughed at some of this exploitation).  I may not want a mental deficient like Gump for an airline pilot, but he deserves to be treated with at least basic decency and courtesy, which this movie doesn't; (i.e. where Gump, shaking Richard Nixon's hand, says 'I gotta pee.'  This is funny?).The mitigating, if not the saving, virtue of FORREST GUMP is the acting. Tom Hanks' rendition of a speech impediment might not fool the parent of a mentally retarded child or a speech pathologist, but it certainly convinced me and the average moviegoer.  Hanks generates the innocence and pleasantness required of the character, and while the voice grated on my nerves a few times, it was bearable.  Gary Sinise as Lt. Dan Taylor is absolutely wonderful, oozing bitterness and cynicism from every pore.I also give FORREST GUMP some grudging praise for being one of the few movies to use the wonders of modern digital special effects to actually drive the plot, rather than distract from it.  TITANIC and JURASSIC PARK also broke some ground, but for the most part I think that most directors lack the imagination to get the most out of the potential of modern special effects.  Zemeckis integrates the effects into his movies more smoothly than most directors have.I didn't really hate FORREST GUMP.  It obviously wants to be loved so much that hating it would be like kicking an annoying puppy.  But it's morally obtuse, shallow and vulgar.  The laughs are guilty laughs, and the philosophy is nothing deeper than the credo that God does indeed look after fools.Rating: ** out of ****.",5,1,5,11 October 1999
The Godfather: Part II," 'They're saps, because they risk their lives for strangers.'
","I am one of the minority who like THE GODFATHER: PART II better than the original.  In the first GODFATHER, we saw Michael give up his dream of an honest life to save his family and lead it back to greatness.  Here, we see he sacrifices everything for his family, and in the end loses even that.At the same time, we see how Michael's father Vito became the great Don. Starting out by doing his family and his fellow immigrants a great favor by eliminating the brutish, terroristic Don Fannucci, Vito ends up merely replacing one tyrant with another in ANIMAL-FARM-like style.As we see Michael and Vito maneuver for power against their enemies (including Hyman Roth, excellently played by Lee Strasberg), we begin to wonder how much worse the mafiosi are than the government officials who surround them.  Their dishonesty and their violence would hardly be out of place in many 'legitimate' governments throughout history, and in some cases even today.  As Michael tells a corrupt Senator played by G.D. Spradlin, 'we're both part of the same hypocrisy.'(Spoilers below).The ending of THE GODFATHER: PART II is one of the most poignant in history, as Michael's memory flashes back to a party before he joined the military. The scene contains four men besides himself: Santino, Fredo, Tessio, and Carlo.  All are dead now - three of them by Michael's own order.  As Tessio mentions that thousands of young men are enlisting to fight the Japanese after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Santino comments, 'They're saps, because they risk their lives for strangers.'  Now Michael, having risked his life for his family for years, finds they are strangers to him who fear and loathe him.  The third part notwithstanding, the tragedy is complete.Rating: **** out of ****.",10,2,2,2 September 1999
The Bourne Identity," A 'suspense' movie that gives everything away right from the start
","I'm not hard to surprise when it comes to movies.  I didn't guess the ending of the SIXTH SENSE, I had no idea who Keyser Soze was, and I didn't predict the twist in PRIMAL FEAR.  But with the BOURNE IDENTITY, it was perfectly obvious exactly who Jason Bourne worked for in the first five minutes, and in the first ten minutes it was clear what his job was.  I simply can't understand how people could call it suspenseful, much less confusing. Frankly, I don't think Director Doug Liman meant to keep anything about Bourne secret from the audience.  And that is stupid, because whatever potential the movie had to generate tension and suspense depended on us being as clueless as Jason Bourne as to who he was.Compare this movie to THE MATRIX.  THE MATRIX is a pretty second-rate movie too, but it's good for its first half, for one reason: we know no more than Neo does.  He doesn't know who Morpheus and Trinity are, or what they're up to, and neither do we.  The brief glimpse we got of Trinity just deepened the mystery.  In THE BOURNE IDENTITY, there is no mystery for us to penetrate; we're just waiting for Bourne to catch up to where we already are, which is simply an exercise in tedium.  This is aggravated by the fact that Bourne is pretty slow on the uptake.  By the time he got out of the Zurich bank, he should have realized that there were only two possibilities for what he was: intelligence agent and professional criminal.  The audience, of course, doesn't even have that much uncertainty, since we are shown Bourne's employers early on.Very little thought went into this movie.  For instance, when Bourne discovers his pile of passports, each with a different identity attached, he should have had no way of determining which one was actually him, since he had no memory.  But he just guesses right, miraculously.  The Swiss police are shown as being unaware that a U.S. Embassy (not present in Zurich anyway) is sovereign U.S. territory.  The Marines guarding the embassy are shown as being unarmed until they get into the arsenal; I've never been to the Swiss embassy, but in Nicaragua the Marines carried their M-16 rifles in the very door of the embassy, and even in the consulates.The best I can say about Franka Potente is that she managed at times to distract me from the fact that she adds nothing to the story.  This movie should have been entirely Bourne's show, and she's there just to provide a love interest and to be a springboard for dialogue, because Liman is too lazy to provide exposition with just Bourne himself.  Julia Stiles is window dressing; the director obviously hasn't the foggiest idea what to do with his female actors.Anyway, THE BOURNE IDENTITY isn't a complete disaster. It gets markedly better in the second half; it's no more credible than before, but at least the stupidities, like Bourne's escape scene, have a payoff in thrills.  The acting is good by everybody.  Take a note of the small touches: when Agbaje enters the morgue, his nostrils quiver as the smell hits him, and when Stiles hands over the information to the assassin, you can detect her fear of him even though he is on her side.  And it has a superior car chase scene.  The acting by everybody is good.Overall, the movie is tolerable, but the premise could have delivered a much better film.Rating: ** out of ****.Recommendation:  Action fans should catch it on TV.",Null,0,1,21 March 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING is a breakthrough
","Quickly, name the last sword-and-sorcery genre movie before this one that was better than mediocre?  I don't know why, but for almost fifteen years American studio efforts in this field have been terrible.  The genre has great potential, for its possibilities are bounded only by the film-maker's imagination.  But it is precisely imagination that has been lacking in the studios.  A return to the drawing board was necessary, and that is what Peter Jackson did, by going back to the founder of sword-and-sorcery as we know it, J.R.R. Tolkien.The result is not only the finest sword-and-sorcery movie to hit screens since THE PRINCESS BRIDE (take ten points, all of you who named it in response to my initial question), it's one of the most spectacular movies of any kind created in this newborn millennium.The story follows the adventures of nine marvelously individualized creatures (humans, Elves, Dwarves, and little people called Hobbits) as they seek to destroy the One Ring, an artifact capable of delivering absolute power to its wielder, and with it the absolute corruption such power inevitably brings.  It is an epic story, which set the pattern for fantasy novels for decades thereafter, and to this day no fantasy author or director has ever surpassed it.Peter Jackson has chosen well which parts of Tolkien's vast saga to include and which to omit.  The story is well rid of such inconsequentials as Gildor, Glorfindel and Tom Bombadil; the bone-chilling barrow scene is a regrettable but unavoidable loss.  Some Tolkien fans were outraged at the expansion of Arwen's role; I was worried too, but having seen the film I am now completely convinced that Jackson was right.  The Arwen of the book is a cipher, with no characteristics except beauty to explain Aragorn's love for her.  Liv Tyler's Arwen is a dynamic, devoted, brave (and beautiful) person, an excellent match for the warrior king.The movie looks great, the imagery inspired not so much by the brothers Hildebrandt as by painter and visual consultant John Howe.  Alan Lee was also a consultant, but fortunately his blurry, colorless style rarely infects the movie.  Too bad that my favorite Tolkien painter of all, Ted Nasmith, had no hand in this, but while he could have improved the movie, the Howe-like colors and light were a perfectly defensible choice for Jackson to make.But not all Jackson's choices are good.  The extensive prologue was clearly not the best way to acquaint the viewers with the story's background; most of it should have been related by Gandalf.  There is also no doubt that revealing the dark lord Sauron early on, in both his forms, was a mistake. The Lothlorien scene is far too brief; it either should have been eliminated completely or expanded to show why Galadriel is so tempted by the Ring and why her land is doomed whether the Ring-bearer succeeds or fails.The acting is well above average.  Veteran Ian McKellen would not have been my choice for the wizard Gandalf; Patrick McGoohan and Sean Connery both appeared to me to be better for the gruff but kindly sorceror.  So it's a good thing that Jackson directed and not me, because McKellen acquits himself far better than either of my choices likely would have.  His genuine love for the little Hobbits shines through in all his scenes, and his stubborn determination is magnificent, containing all the wisdom of age with none of the frailty.  Second best is Sean Bean's Boromir, a vastly better character than the Boromir of the book.  Tolkien's Boromir is such a p**** that it's hard to understand why his fellows even care about him; Bean's Boromir can be a p**** sometimes too, but in this case that's only one side of his character, and his love for the people of Gondor and for his home city of Minas Tirith draws our sympathy.  Very strong is Christopher Lee's Saruman; a wizard whose chief weapon is his voice could have had no better voice than Lee's to represent him.  Ian Holm also does a superb Bilbo.There are no really bad performances, but two disappointing ones.  Elijah Wood  doesn't do anything clearly wrong as Frodo, but he is just less interesting than all the colorful characters surrounding him.  As for Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, I may have set my expectations too high.  Mortensen is a favorite of mine, one of the most versatile men in movies today.  As Aragorn he is not bad, but never looks comfortable in his role.  In his second scene with Liv Tyler in Rivendell, Tyler looks like she's in love, while Mortensen just looks astounded that she loves him.  I couldn't see him loving her back.  In the last scene between Mortensen and Bean, something also seems subtly wrong; I don't know what it was, but somehow it felt as if Mortensen was trying too hard.As a postscript, I liked a scene that was almost universally reviled: the wizard's duel.  I can see why most people didn't like it, since it was easy to look at it as just two men being jerked around by wires.  If the acting by both combatants hadn't been so good, I might have seen it that way too. And yet, I am dead certain that shooting the scene more conventionally, with colorful rays and balls of light and lightning bolts, would have been a mistake.  It would have looked like two men operating high-tech weapons instead of using the art of wizardry.  To me, it really did feel like these men had unseen powers at their command.  Jackson's way of making the scene may have been an error too, but I think it was the better of the two errors to make.Rating: ***1/2 out of ****Recommendation: See it in the theater.

Being John Malkovich," Was there a reason I had to suffer for 112 minutes?
","I'm not sure that BEING JOHN MALKOVICH is a bad movie.  It may even be a brilliant movie, for all I can tell.  What I am sure about is that BEING JOHN MALKOVICH is absolute torture to watch, in a way very few movies are. The ordinary bad movie feels like being hit over the head and robbed.  The robber's motivation is easily understood.  This movie is like being hit over the head and then left to bleed in the street.  As you lie there you wonder, 'Why did he do that?  What did I ever do to him?' and you don't know the answer, but you know for damn sure that your head hurts.Here there be spoilers.  If the description above makes the movie sound too good to miss, don't keep reading.BEING JOHN MALKOVICH is mostly about an unsuccessful puppeteer, Craig Schwartz, who discovers a magical secret passage which allows him to see out of the eyes of actor John Malkovich.  Schwartz eventually learns to use this passage to actually take control of Malkovich's entire body, reducing him to a human puppet.  Schwartz uses this ability to betray his wife and score with his fellow office worker, Maxine, who has not the slightest interest in him or his art, but who is instantly aroused by money and the ability to manipulate people.Where to begin?  Craig Schwartz and Maxine are among the most appalling human beings I have ever seen.  I can't begin to imagine what Schwartz finds even attractive in Maxine, never mind lovable.  His wife Lotte is stupid, yes, but at first she actually cares for him, which Maxine never does.  In fact, Lotte is the only reason Craig isn't sleeping on a park bench.  What's more, Lotte is physically beautiful, while Maxine is every bit as reptilian in her outward appearance as in her inward personality.  Yet, betraying Lotte isn't the most abominable thing Craig does - indeed, it isn't even the most abominable thing he does to her.The act the chief characters engage in is a metaphorical act of rape: that is to say, the invasion of another person's body without their consent.  At first, it's equivalent to the kind of rape committed on a sleeping person without their knowledge; later, it becomes equivalent to the more brutal kind.  The visualization of the means used to invade Malkovich's body - a dark, wet tunnel filled with mud - lends a disgusting literalness to the metaphor.  As you may have guessed, this is not funny.But this is not all that makes BEING JOHN MALKOVICH torture.  The film itself is almost unbelievably ugly.  Not for every second, I'll admit; Cameron Diaz is pretty, and so are the puppets.  But they only make the rest of the movie look uglier in comparison.  Everything looks dark, dingy, and seedy.  Color seems to have been drained out of the film.  I doubt that Catherine Keener is anywhere near as ugly in real life as the movie makes her look, and I know for sure that John Cusack isn't.  BEING JOHN MALKOVICH looks the way the world does when you wake up with a hangover.Given the repulsive characters, the sordid subject matter, the hideous images, and the nearly complete absence of humor or even fun, I can't believe that director Spike Jonze was actually aiming for comedy.  Nobody could possibly miss the target that widely by accident.  Some serious point about rape and evil was surely intended.  But what?  I did pick up on the point that, even though he is a disgraceful human being, Craig is a genuinely talented artist whose abilities are unjustly overlooked; having 'become' John Malkovich, his art has not changed in the least, but suddenly the public claims to adore it.  Is that unfairness the message of the movie? If so, couldn't it have been conveyed without tormenting me?There's not much satisfaction in the ending, either.  Craig does meet a horrible fate, which he deserves, but Maxine and the other villains of the story proceed to live happily ever after, while Malkovich, the only completely innocent party in the whole affair, meets the most dreadful end of all.  I'm hoping the ending was meant to be unsatisfying; the other possibility, that we are meant to feel glad for the triumph of evil, is simply too bizarre to contemplate.Maybe some person smarter than I figured out the message this movie was intended to convey.  If you are that person, please e-mail me with the secret, because no way am I going to subject myself to BEING JOHN MALKOVICH again.Rating: *1/2 out of ****Recommendation: If you enjoy solving chess problems while having your hair pulled out, this is the movie for you.",Null,1,2,21 October 2002
Pearl Harbor," It's not the history that's bad, it's the story
","It mystifies me that the complaints against this movie so often center around its lack of historical accuracy.  I hate to tell you this, guys, but the movie mostly gets the history right.  There's a minor detail wrong here and there, but if somebody who never heard of World War II saw this movie, he would walk away with a very clear picture of what happened at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.  He would know that the Japanese planned the attack meticulously, that they struck without warning and achieved complete surprise, that the battleships were caught moored in the harbor, that the American carriers were not damaged, that the ARIZONA exploded and the OKLAHOMA capsized.  He would even know that the Japanese admiral who planned the attack, Isoroku Yamamoto, had severe doubts about Japan's ability to win the war it was starting.Perfect historical accuracy was not achieved, but neither was it claimed. The movie never pretended to be anything but a fictional story set against a historical backdrop, and the historical backdrop is perfectly adequate - far better than average for Hollywood.  It's the fictional story in the foreground that stinks.PEARL HARBOR's story is about a love triangle.  That's not the problem either.  The love triangle is a perfectly good plot device; some of the finest dramas ever made are built on it.  But the device can't work by itself.  It's a setup for the characters to make dramatic choices.  In PEARL HARBOR, the characters in the triangle mostly don't make any choices, and even when they do, the choices are irrelevant.  Forces outside the characters themselves set the triangle up; forces outside themselves then resolve it.  The characters' own thoughts and feelings don't drive the story.The arbitrary setup and denouement aren't the only problems with the story, though they are the worst.  The movie also presents stupidity as if it were a survival skill.  From their boyhood to their adulthood, Rafe McCawley and Danny Walker fly like dummies.  This isn't accidental; the movie deliberately paints them as dangerous to themselves and their comrades.  In the real world, stupid military pilots die - quickly.  World War II aerial warfare was one of the most unforgiving combat arenas in military history (for instance, you could very easily kill yourself without any help from the enemy).  What would it have cost to show these fellows as being aces because they were smart?  Not only would the movie have been truer to life, but it would have been more fun to watch.I can't help but sympathize with Cuba Gooding, Jr., who might as well have had 'gotta get the black demographic' stamped on his forehead.  He has nothing, nothing whatsoever, to do with the actual story; he doesn't interact with any of the main characters meaningfully, and had he been white he would have been written out of the script or, more likely, never written into it in the first place.  I have to admire Gooding's professionalism, since he did a good job anyway, even though he must have known he was a token.  I hope most of the black viewers had the good sense to feel insulted by the condescending assumption that no black person would have any interest in a story about white people.At least the bloated budget does achieve the things that bloated budgets can do.  The high-dollar acting talent pays off.  Ben Affleck's acting is superb; he does pain, resentment and embarrassment very well.  He doesn't get a chance to be subtle, but screenwriter Randall Wallace clearly intended Rafe McCawley to be a man who wears his heart on his sleeve.  Mako does a first-rate Admiral Yamamoto; his lined face and spare figure make him less than a perfect physical match for the real man, but he gets his spirit just right.  The visual effects are reasonably good.PEARL HARBOR was made in an attempt to copy the success of TITANIC.  Even the most rabid TITANIC-hater will have to admit, on seeing PEARL HARBOR, that James Cameron could have done a lot worse.  He could have made a movie like this one.Rating: ** out of ****Recommendation:  See it on cable on a slow night.",Null,0,1,21 October 2002
The Usual Suspects," Clever and well-executed, but not really gripping
","THE USUAL SUSPECTS begins with a shadowy figure murdering a man named Keaton, whom we do not know yet.  The mysterious person then sets a wharf and ship on fire.  Dozens of people are killed.  While one police team tries to get information out of a badly burned survivor who cannot speak English, Detective Kujan (Chazz Palminteri) interviews the only other survivor, a shy, crippled nebbish called Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey).  The rest of the story is told by Verbal in flashback as Kujan interrogates him. 
Verbal starts the tale six months ago, when a truck is hijacked, and the police round up five hardened criminals, the usual suspects, to place in a lineup.  Verbal runs scams; McManus and Hockney (Stephen Baldwin and Kevin Pollak) are a team of armed robbers and safecrackers; I'm not sure what Fenster (Benicio del Toro) does, since his accent is so hard to understand; and Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne) is a crooked cop trying to go straight. None of them gets arrested for the hijacking, but McManus proposes a team robbery while they are together, and thus an impromptu criminal team comes together.Both Verbal and the Hungarian survivor think that the mysterious figure of Keyser Soze, a legendary criminal, is manipulating the five men behind the scenes, especially when Verbal tells how an emissary of Keyser Soze (Pete Postlethwaite) approaches the team and coerces them into doing a job for him.  Soze is never expressly identified on screen, leading both the audience and the characters to wonder whether he really exists, and if he does, if he might not be one of the characters we've already met.THE USUAL SUSPECTS gets most of its mileage out of the device of Keyser Soze; not knowing who he is lends a lot of suspense to the sordid goings-on. THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT became a huge success for only one reason; the production team remembered that the unseen and imagined is more terrifying than anything that can be shown on screen.  THE USUAL SUSPECTS takes advantage of this same principle.The movie's ending is its raison d'etre; even if you have guessed the identity of Keyser Soze, you will be some distance short of anticipating all the last-minute twists that the script visits upon you.  It does leave you picking back over the movie trying to sort reality from illusion for some time thereafter.Unfortunately, THE USUAL SUSPECTS isn't a really superb thriller, because the team of Verbal, Fenster, Keaton, McManus and Hockney just doesn't contain a single sympathetic character, or even a particularly well-drawn one.  The audience doesn't have much emotion invested in what happens to them, or whether one or any of them is the mysterious Keyser Soze. Intellectually, the film is pleasing, but abstract; there's nothing at stake that really matters to the viewer.In the acting department, everybody is good, and Spacey and Baldwin are excellent.  Director Bryan Singer sets a steady pace, not as fierce as a De Palma, never mind a Hitchcock, could have produced, but without ever really being boring.  John Ottman's music is exceptional and Singer applies it to the scenes very well.A thriller movie that makes the viewers think is a rare exception to the rule, and so THE USUAL SUSPECTS is enjoyable.  Could we please have one that makes us feel, too?Rating: *** out of ****.",7,0,1,5 October 1999
Independence Day," Almost as bad as reported
","(Some spoilers).INDEPENDENCE DAY is the story of an attack on the planet Earth by the dumbest aliens in the universe.  In this movie, a heroic president (Bill Pullman), a crackerjack fighter pilot (Will Smith), and a computer programmer (Jeff Goldblum), with some help, manage to defeat the combined efforts of an entire species that has been scoping Earth out for decades in. . . two or three days.Words cannot describe how stupid these aliens are.  We'll leave aside the unlikelihood that a species thousands of years ahead of us technologically still hasn't advanced culturally beyond the rob-and-pillage society of the 13th-century Mongols.  It seems unlikely, but you have to admit that we humans have kept on being pretty brutal to each other despite our advancing technology.  But why would such aliens do something like blast Earth's cities, building by building, to get rid of us?  That's something like trying to exterminate ants by stomping on them one by one.  If the aliens wanted to get rid of us, they'd just bioengineer a microbe specifically bred to eliminate only humans, or whatever species they wanted to eliminate. Humans are only a hundred years at most away from being able to do this; to highly advanced aliens it would be routine, especially when they've putatively been spying on us and experimenting on us for decades.  They expose their flying saucers to attack from Earth's combined air forces, for no visible reason.  It's enough to make you wonder how these aliens ever lasted this long in the planet-conquering business.Then, of course, there's Goldblum using a computer virus to defeat the aliens, which makes about as much sense as the idea of using ENIAC to sabotage a Cray.  No, make that less sense.  And there's an alien that keels over at one punch from Will Smith but then kills half a dozen scalpel-armed lab technicians a few scenes later.  This goes beyond any reasonable suspension of disbelief; it's just plain lazy writing.Jeff Goldblum's acting is wooden and unappealing, and the characters are extremely one-dimensional.  I know some will say to forget about these matters and just be entertained, but that's not the point; I *need* to see some interesting people to be entertained, and the feeling of having my intelligence insulted makes for a less entertaining experience.  By the same token, thoughtful scripts and fleshed out characters aren't just more prestigious and more 'arty'; they're a lot more entertaining, too!Anyway, there are some good points to INDEPENDENCE DAY.  Aside from Goldblum, the acting is mostly pretty good.  Will Smith is passably cocky and arrogant, and Bill Pullman has some charisma as the president.  Judd Hirsch is so good that he manages to give some life to his cliche character. There are some humorous one-liners such as 'Welcome to Earth!' and 'Nobody's perfect.'The special effects truly are breathtaking at times, as when the shadow of the alien ship creeps over whole cities at a time.  I truly did feel as the Carib Indians must have felt when Columbus landed on Hispaniola and confronted them with something totally outside the range of their experience.  Off the big screen, this effect would be lost, so I don't recommend renting this movie on video tape.A man like Whitmore could never be president of the United States, but I can see what Emmerich was trying for; this is the guy a lot of Americans wish they had as president, instead of the snake-oil salesmen we usually get. And while it's totally unrealistic, even given his pilot's experience, that Whitmore would fly in combat, it sure would be nice to have a president who knew that the country would survive just fine even if he died.  (America has had five presidents die in office; the country survived each time none the worse for wear).Oddly I feel compelled to defend this stupid movie from its detractors in at least one respect; its American patriotism.  Patriotism, American or otherwise, is not in and of itself a bad thing to have in a movie. CASABLANCA is loaded with French patriotism (they play La Marseillaise at least twice); THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING is chock full of British patriotism; the Oscar-winning MRS. MINIVER is also full of British patriotism;  EXODUS is to a great degree an exercise in Israeli patriotism; and the much-hailed ALEKSANDR NEVSKI is a celebration of Russian patriotism.  Americans should be allowed their own patriotic movies (though preferably higher quality than this one).  Pullman has repeatedly been excoriated for suggesting that July 4 would become an international holiday, completely missing the point that such a holiday would be celebrating not American independence, but rather the combined efforts of *all* the world's countries to fight off the alien scourge, an event that certainly would deserve international commemoration and which happened to occur on July 4.Lazy, dumb, overblown and insulting, INDEPENDENCE DAY is not worth renting. But it is not as worthless as some would have you believe, and if by some chance it returns to the dollar theater, you could do worse than see a little humor and some good special effects on the wide screen, if you're in a tolerant mood.Rating: ** out of ****.",5,1,2,8 September 1999
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," How could anyone think this one was better than the first? (Spoilers, but nothing not already revealed in the trailers)
","Don't get me wrong, I think THE TWO TOWERS is a good movie.  I suppose, if you're tolerant, you might even call it as good as THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING.  But how could Time magazine run a cover calling it *better* than its predecessor?  Its strengths are the same strengths as the first movie's. Its weaknesses, on the other hand, are pretty well its own.Let's review those strengths.  Strong, charismatic performance by Ian McKellen as Gandalf?  Check.  Grand, sweeping vistas of the Middle Earth terrain?  Check.  Epic, savage battle scenes?  Check.  Dark, brooding cinematography?  Check.  Danger and the theme of struggle within oneself against the temptations of power?  Check.  Yep, we have a good movie here; it would take a lot of incompetence to ruin all those elements.But by gosh, sometimes it looks like Jackson tried.  Despite sacrificing much more of the story than the first one did, this movie covers less ground; given more than a chapter's head start, it fails to make it anywhere near the final chapter.I find it amazing that so many people focus on what was done to Faramir's character, when far worse was done elsewhere.  In fact, I liked what Jackson did to Faramir's character.  Tolkien's Faramir is insufferable; give me Samwise's honest humility any day over Faramir's how-noble-were-my-ancestors-before-they-bred-with-lesser-men posturing.  I like the fact that Jackson's Faramir feels the same temptation as his brother, but unlike Boromir, he is able to overcome it.  Gimli is the one who's been really let down, being completely reduced to a laughingstock. There were a few laughs at his expense in the first movie, but he was also clearly a warrior and a hero.  Now he's been made into a useless encumbrance for the sake of comic relief.Both TFOTR and TTT make significant changes from the book.  But in the first movie these were well-considered changes, omitting the inessentials and in some cases improving considerably on the book.  For one instance, Jackson's Boromir is a much more sympathetic tragic hero than the boor that Tolkien gave us; for another, Jackson's choice to have Aragorn deliberately part from Frodo, afraid that his love for Gondor would tempt him to steal the Ring, is far more dramatic than the fiat of fate Tolkien used. 
In TTT, the changes are not nearly so well thought out.  Consider the decision to have Theoden be directly possessed by Saruman.  Okay, that could have worked.  But Jackson overlooks the fact that this possession makes Grima the Wormtongue totally superfluous.  Grima's only job, influencing the King, is no longer necessary, and his presence in the court puts Saruman's plans at risk of discovery.  Either Grima should have been edited out completely, or the possession business should have been canned.  Also, since Jackson retains the scene where Grima is expelled, he should also have retained Tolkien's far superior version of it, where Grima is given a chance to redeem himself and throws it away.In the first movie, Arwen sensibly appears only when she is relevant to the action.  Her love scenes with Aragorn are well woven into the course of the story.  Here, while her scenes are quite well done in themselves, they are sometimes intrusive, and in several cases it is obvious that they should have been saved for the third movie.  Arwen's return to a desolate Lothlorien is one of the most tragic, heart-rending scenes Tolkien ever wrote, a perfect conclusion to the story of the Third Age.  To anticlimactically stick this scene into the middle of the second book is unforgivable.Finally, I object to the Ents being reduced to incompetents who don't even notice what Saruman is doing to their trees until a Hobbit shoves it under their noses.The only possible claim TTT has to superiority over the TFOTR is Andy Serkis' Gollum.  I was terrified of getting another Jar-Jar Binks; instead Gollum is one of the best CGI characters I've ever seen, very Hobbit-like while still being beastish.  Serkis makes Gollum menacing and pitiable at the same time.  He is probably the truest character to Tolkien's vision in either of the two movies.So, take THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING, slow it down, remove Sean Bean and Ian Holm, two of the best actors in it, greatly reduce Ian McKellen's role, and replace the well-judged changes from Tolkien's story with modifications that appear to have been thought up at the last minute.  You now have THE TWO TOWERS.  Is it good?  Yes.  Is it an improvement?  No.Rating: **Â½ out of ****.Recommendation:  See it in the theater, but don't set your expectations too high.",Null,0,0,25 February 2003
K-19: The Widowmaker," Good story, but not history; it cheats to raise the stakes
","Spoilers ahead, mate!  Turn your course ninety degrees north or you'll run aground on Spoiler Island!The opening says, `Inspired by actual events,' which basically means that there really was a Hotel-class sub called K-19 that had reactor trouble. That's about as close as the movie gets to the real events.  Everything else, even the names of the participants, has been changed to serve the story.But it's a good story, with interesting people, conflict over important things, and jaw-hurting tension.  Captain Vostrikov and XO Polenin are excellently portrayed by Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson (and their accents aren't as bad as all that; aside from varying in intensity they were decent enough).  Vostrikov really is a bad and irresponsible commander; every criticism that Polenin levels at him is true.   That makes Polenin's actions in supporting him all the more interesting.  But Vostrikov does learn from Polenin's example.The heart of the movie is the reactor near-meltdown, and the terrible consequences it has.  Military movies all too often portray courage as simply risking one's life to kill other people.  But what you see in this movie is REAL courage: I'd rather go into battle ten times than do what the reactor techs have to do in this movie.  Bigelow's portrayal of the chief reactor officer's breakdown is a touch of genius; it shows us what the people who did go into the reactor chamber felt, and overcame, and what the reactor officer himself overcomes later in the movie.  This movie should never have been marketed as a blockbuster; it works best as a simple and touching tale of heroism.Regrettably, Bigelow felt she had to cheat to keep the audience's interest, specifically by selling us the preposterous story that the reactor meltdown could have caused a 1.4 megaton nuclear explosion.  This changes the story from one that merely didn't happen, into one that could not possibly have ever happened.  Nuclear reactors cannot cause nuclear explosions, because they don't use weapons-grade uranium.  Even if they did, it would require explosives, not just heat, to crush the uranium to a sufficiently supercritical density to detonate it.Why did Bigelow resort to this?  Did she believe that a Western-world audience wouldn't care about the fate of mere Russkies, so that she needed to pretend that the fate of the whole world depended on K-19 to keep her viewers watching?  If so, she lacked confidence in the story she told.  I was, and am, a partisan of the West in the Cold War, and am glad that the West emerged victorious, but neither am I inclined to blame these Soviet Navy sailors for the evils of the tyrannical system that they were born into.  I would have enjoyed the movie every bit as much had Bigelow admitted that the sailors were fighting only for their own lives and the lives of their fellow crewmen.  And for those chauvinists who would see these sailors as less than human for being Russian, pretending that they saved the world doesn't help.Rating: *** out of ****.Recommendation: See it in the theater, and bring your suspension of disbelief along; it needs a workout.",Null,18,24,16 August 2003
Patton," Fascinating portrait of the Allies' greatest general
","A few years ago, I had the pleasure of reading 'The Patton Papers,' a collection of Gen. Patton's diary entries and letters edited by Martin Blumenson.  Having seen the movie, I think that no actor has ever better captured the spirit of a man better than George C. Scott, nor has any movie better portrayed that spirit than PATTON.Patton was a man who lived for war.  World War II was the high point and culmination of his life.  He didn't fight for any principles, he didn't fight to defend freedom or democracy or any abstract idea; he fought because he loved fighting.  In his diaries you can read of his fear of flunking out of West Point; the prospect terrified him because he was certain that he would never be good at anything except being a general or a leader of a country.  As a leader of men, he was exceptional.  His speech at the beginning of the movie is vintage Patton, an almost exact reproduction of a speech Patton actually gave to Third Army.  It's tough, and no-nonsense; Patton lets you know in no uncertain terms that he is here to win, to destroy the enemy, and by God you'd better be too.  I don't know if Patton actually directed traffic on the roads as he is shown doing in the movie, but it was a very Pattonish thing to do.  Patton did on at least one occasion get out of his staff car and join a squad of G.I.'s in heaving a vehicle out of the mud. Try to imagine Montgomery doing that; the very thought is hilarious!Patton's character explains his treatment of his men.  To those who had been wounded fighting for him he was always kind and considerate.  But to those whose minds could not stand the horrible strain that war imposed on them, he was merciless; he could not comprehend the fact that other people didn't share his love of violence for violence' sake.  PATTON shows this aspect of his character very well.Karl Malden's Omar Bradley is shown in an almost father-like role; he sees and recognizes Patton's immense talents as a general, and uses them in spite of Patton's natural ability to antagonize everybody around him.  Not shown in the movie is Patton's unloveable characteristic of turning on his subordinates once they surpassed him in their careers.  Patton had nothing but good to say about Bradley, until Bradley was promoted over Patton's head, whereupon Patton savaged Bradley in his diary.  Patton did the same to Eisenhower.A general can have no higher compliment than the fear and respect of his adversaries, and as PATTON demonstrates, Patton was more feared by the Germans than any other Allied general, at least on the Western front.  As one German officer observes all too prophetically, 'the absence of war will destroy him [Patton].'  And although mankind's single greatest stroke of good fortune in the 20th century was that Russia and America never came to blows, it is still hard not to feel sorry for Patton as he desperately seeks his superiors' approval to carry the war on eastward into the Soviet Union - anything, just to have a war to fight.  Patton is like an addict to a destructive drug.Hollywood has rarely given us such a textured and human portrait of a great man: cruel, often foolish in his relations with others, rude, and psychopathically attached to violence, but brave, dedicated, and loyal. Certainly those who, like myself, have Jewish blood, or who were otherwise marked for death by the Nazi state, all owe him a great debt of gratitude for his pivotal role in destroying that state.  And yet, had he been born German, Patton would surely have fought just as devotedly for the Nazi side. I'm glad he wasn't.Rating: **** out of ****.",9,168,226,8 September 1999
The Last Samurai," Hooray for Omura!
","Let it never be said that Edward Zwick doesn't know how to make beautiful movies.  Glory, Courage Under Fire, and The Siege are all magnificent to look at, and The Last Samurai is the most gorgeous of them all.  It is also, by far, the worst story of the four.Tom Cruise plays Algren, an American Army officer tortured by guilt over his role in the slaughter of Indians and seething with bitterness toward his former commander, Custer.  He speaks disparagingly of his comrades who died for `modern conveniences.'  So he feels conflicted when he is hired by a Japanese railroad baron named Omura to train the Japanese Emperor's army to crush a rebellion by traditionalist samurai who want to block Japan's Westernizing path to modernity.Now, a word or two about those `modern conveniences' that Algren disparages. Those conveniences include living past the age of one (which about half the Western population owes to modern vaccines and plumbing), being able to read (a luxury of the church and nobility until modern schools came along), and the radical concept of constitutional democracy, which may have been conceived of in Greece but not successfully practiced until modern times. These modern conveniences are worth fighting for, and it is no credit to Algren - or to Katsumoto, the leader of the samurai rebels - that they fail to see their worth.The man who does see their worth is Omura, who is made out as a villain but who ought to be the hero of the film.  He is represented as being a coward and a fool on the battlefield, but in fact he does the single bravest thing of anybody in the movie.  Katsumoto enters the imperial council chamber wearing his swords, defying the Emperor's law forbidding these weapons. Omura bars Katsumoto's way, standing unarmed before a master swordsman who could cut his head from his shoulders with one well-practiced motion, and says, `We are a nation of laws.'  Omura stands in the shoes of many Japanese who stood up for law against Japan's feudal reactionaries, and happily he wins, instead of being defeated and murdered like many of the militarists' opponents in the 1920s and 1930s1.The message Zwick wants to get across is simple; the samurai lived for honor, therefore they were good.  Westerners are dishonorable, and any Japanese who wants to Westernize his country is a despicable sellout. This is simply an ignorant idealization of the samurai.  There was much to admire about the followers of bushido: allowing for individual variation, they were disciplined and brave beyond anyone else the human species has yet produced, and were taught to make and appreciate art in a manner that their Western counterparts, the medieval knights, would have scorned as effeminate.  But like all human beings, the samurai were far from perfect.  They were hidebound traditionalists who froze Japanese society in stasis for hundreds of years.  They may have protected the common folk from bandits, but they were equally capable of testing a new sword's blade by cutting down a passing townsman.  They were xenophobic to a degree even the most ignorant and bigoted redneck would be hard-pressed to match.Akira Kurosawa, who understood the history of the samurai, saw through the simple-minded myth that Zwick has swallowed, as he showed through his character Kikuchiyo's speech in The Seven Samurai: `But then who made them [the Japanese farmers] such beasts? You did! You samurai did it! You burn their villages! Destroy their farms! Steal their food! Force them to labor! Take their women! And kill them if they resist!'  Kurosawa's samurai are people, real individuals with both good and bad in their natures.  Zwick's samurai are simply symbols, non-human ideals to which his guilt-ridden hero aspires.The Last Samurai is an excellent example of what George Orwell called `transferred nationalism.'  Orwell saw that after someone like Zwick has been stripped of attachment to his own country, he `still feels the need for a Fatherland, and it is natural to look for one somewhere abroad. Having found it, he can wallow unrestrainedly in exactly those emotions from which he believes that he has emancipated himself. God, the King, the Empire, the Union Jack -- all the overthrown idols can reappear under different names, and because they are not recognized for what they are they can be worshiped with a good conscience. . . . [Transferred nationalism] makes it possible for him to be much more nationalistic -- more vulgar, more silly, more malignant, more dishonest -- than he could ever be on behalf of his native country, or any unit of which he had real knowledge.'  This is exactly what has happened with Zwick.  His knowledge of American history has made it impossible for him to portray the U.S. cavalry or the cowboys as pure-hearted superheroes, so he has simply transplanted those traits into the samurai, and because he does not know much about the samurai he can avoid seeing that they do not live up to these ideals.  Kurosawa, with a real knowledge of bushido and its influence on Japanese culture, could never have done something so silly.But despite its naivete, The Last Samurai is worth watching.  The cinematography by John Toll is breathtaking.  The acting is very good all around.  Anyone who was watching Tom Cruise with an open mind saw that he did an outstanding job of shedding his 20th-century persona.  Masato Harada is excellent as Omura despite Zwick's butchering of his character; Shin Koyamada is heart-wrenching as the young samurai Nobutada, and Hiroyuki Sanada does great work as the gruff old warrior Ujio.  There is a magnificent score by Hans Zimmer, which Zwick uses to excellent effect (there is a sequence in the final battle where Zwick times his cuts to the beat of the music, which may be the single best use of a film score that I have ever seen).  As a story and a lesson, The Last Samurai is poor; as just plain cinema, it's terrific.Rating: **½ out of ****.Recommendation:  Watch it, just don't believe it.",Null,10,20,8 April 2004
Pulp Fiction," The appeal of this movie escapes me
","This oddly intertwined series of tales is chiefly about two professional assassins, Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson), and their misadventures in the world of murder, crime, and taking the boss's wife out to eat.  (Trust me, this is not as funny as it sounds). Haphazardly intermixed with this is the story of the boss, Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) and of Butch (Bruce Willis), a boxer who refuses to throw a fight for Wallace and thus earns his enmity.Some things are not wrong with PULP FICTION.  I do not believe, as some do, that it is intended to glorify violence and drug abuse.  It does play both these things for comic effect, in what I found a very tasteless, vulgar, and unfunny style, but I don't think Tarantino was trying to tell the audience that violence and drug abuse are actually fun and beneficial; inconvenient and inglorious consequences of both are shown quite graphically.  And the acting by Jackson, Rhames, and, yes, Willis is pretty darn good.Nevertheless, PULP FICTION bored me out of my mind.  I was not interested in the characters, because none of them is sympathetic; none feels about the world or reacts to it in any way remotely approaching my own.  And much of the movie is spent in long dialogue that does nothing to advance the plot. To be fair, Tarantino does have an ear for realistic, earthy-sounding phrases.  The lines never sound artificial, forced or strained; they do sound just like the spontaneous banalities that form the backbone of real people's conversations.  But I don't listen to strangers' banal conversations, because they're boring if I don't know the people.  And that's exactly how boring the conversations in PULP FICTION are.PULP FICTION's genius is generally said to lie in its accomplishments as a black comedy.  Well, whatever floats your boat.  I got very few laughs out of this picture.  Interestingly, I always find my friends' re-enactments of their favorite scenes from PULP FICTION to be much funnier than seeing the scenes themselves.  I was amused twice in the final tale by Tarantino's spoofing of movie cliches, as where Jules urged Honeybunny to 'stay calm, point the gun at me,' and where a hapless gunman misses Jules and Vincent with an entire magazine at point blank range, much to all parties' amazement.  But aside from that, the comedy eluded me.  I don't know how anyone could hail lower than lowbrow humor like Christopher Walken's scene as being some kind of comic genius.  Furthermore, realistically brutal violence and comedy don't mix well for my taste.Tarantino does have some imagination handling the camera.  For instance, Vincent at one point is told that Marsellus Wallace had a man thrown off a building for massaging Mrs. Wallace's feet; later, when Vincent meets Mrs. Wallace on orders to take her to a restaurant, the camera never leaves Mrs. Wallace's feet.But Tarantino's imagination often is no more than showing off.  The film's structure appeals to the sort of over-literate viewer for whom the word 'nonlinear' is synonymous with 'brilliant' and 'artistic.'  Not to be a spoilsport, but there's a good reason most movie scripts are arranged in a linear fashion: that happens to be the way time flows.  I'm not saying you can't tell a good nonlinear story, but there'd better be a reason for it. And I cannot tell what Tarantino thinks he accomplished by mixing at least five (counting the opening scene) different time sequences together in a seemingly random order.  I was not confused, but many others were, and I don't see what Tarantino gained in exchange for losing them.  One reviewer has suggested this device enabled Tarantino to put Jules' 'redemption' at the end, thus finishing the movie on a positive note.  If this is so, then the conclusion is just as manipulative and intellectually dishonest as any standard tacked-on Hollywood feel-good ending.Not that the ending is really bad; in fact I gave the movie an extra half star for its ending, as I finally became interested in one of the characters.  I would have liked to find out whether Jules succeeded in leaving the criminal life.  Of course, I take self-confessed 'redemptions' with a grain of salt, but since Jules seems to be uncertain himself about whether he'll kick the criminal habit, I can live with that.  But redeemed or not, Jackson couldn't completely redeem this frequently tedious, sometimes nauseating, and rarely funny two and a half hours.Rating: ** out of ****.",5,6,10,8 October 1999
Titanic," I loved it. So sue me.
","TITANIC provoked polarized reactions from its first screening.  For many, it was the greatest movie ever made; some patrons were reliably reported to have seen it more than thirty times, and it became by far the highest-grossing production in cinematic history.  But a fairly large minority of people, both in the average film-going public and among the critics, felt that the TITANIC craze was much ado about nothing, and many of them bitterly resented its bloated budget which they felt could have gone to far worthier films.  Two years after its release, the ardency of TITANIC fans is no longer quite so hot, but its detractors seem to grow ever more bitter, and thus a backlash has snapped out against the movie that has driven it from its former place at number one (!) in Internet Movie Database voting to a place completely off the top 250.  It's become passe to like TITANIC, but I still like it.  A whole lot, in fact.  And while I don't think it ever belonged in the #1 spot, ranking it below mediocre stuff like THE PHANTOM MENACE (#199) or FORREST GUMP (#172) just isn't fair.TITANIC is the story of two fictional passengers on the White Star Line's most famous vessel.  Rose Bukater (Kate Winslet) is the child of a family high in social class but deeply in debt; Rose's mother (Frances Fisher) plans to rectify this by betrothing Rose to the rich but odious Cal Hockley (Billy Zane).  Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a penniless dock-worker who has won his ticket on the TITANIC in a poker game.  Rose, having gotten a good look at just what her future with Cal Hockley will be like, attempts suicide, but is stopped by Jack, which sparks a brief but memorably passionate romance between them, under the shadow of the disaster we know awaits the ship.If you had told me in 1996 that James Cameron would direct a movie which had no violence or chase scenes for the first two hours, I would have laughed in your face.  I honestly had no idea that Cameron was capable of gentle scenes so rich with humor, affection, and grand spectacle.  The greatest ship ever launched comes to life and we get the grand tour, from the massive, throbbing engines to the graceful swanlike prow.  We get a sense of just how grand this voyage was for all participants, rich or poor.Leonardo DiCaprio shouldn't have been the sole focus of this movie's popularity.  Not that he does a bad job; he always delivers Cameron's sometimes strained lines believably and sincerely, and he does some fine work in a difficult late scene where he has to mix fury and love in the same moment, simultaneously kissing and berating Rose when she stays with him rather than flee in a lifeboat.  But Kate Winslet's performance is the real meat of TITANIC.  Her large liquid eyes can be heart-melting when she wishes.  She perfectly simulates the mixed embarrassment and joy she feels as Jack teaches her to break down the inhibitions that her class and upbringing have placed on her.  And at one point she delivers a kind of 'stuck for words' expression that is so perfect that she couldn't have done it better if she really had forgotten her lines.Billy Zane has a comparatively easy job as the villainous Cal Hockley, it's a one-note role, and Zane plays it that way.  While he's certainly not the most interesting villain ever to appear on screen, comparisons of him to Snidely Whiplash are unfair.  Hockley is not motiveless; he is merely one of those men who thinks of women as property rather than as human beings. There are millions of Hockleys in the world today, and you can see the wreckage they leave in their wake in any battered women's shelter. Hockley's character is perfectly realistic, just not particularly deep.My favorite supporting actor in this movie was Victor Garber in the quiet and understated role of Thomas Andrews, TITANIC's shipwright.  Of his many fine moments, the best is his reaction to Bruce Ismay's anguished protest, 'This ship can't sink!'  'She's made of iron, sir.  I assure you, she can.' Almost any other actor handed that line would have delivered it with contempt and sarcasm.  But Garber does it more with a mixture of disbelief and real pity, as he realizes that the man he is facing is emotionally incapable of facing reality.TITANIC certainly has many flaws.  The framing story is sometimes mishandled, making the first half hour drag.  The humorous wisecracks, while funny, are often very poorly timed and undercut the drama of the scenes. Since Cameron has to tell his story during the brief duration of the TITANIC's voyage, Rose's transformation from inhibited prisoner of class expectations to free and independent woman is too hasty.  Cameron also at times seems intent on demonizing the rich just for being rich, a tad hypocritical for a man who risked and made millions on this movie.  And the dialogue has more than its share of melodramatic lines and the odd cliche, though Winslet and DiCaprio deliver it so well that I generally didn't mind.Still, there is great power in Cameron's invitation to become attached to something you know is doomed.  Some refuse to take the risk, but not wisely; everything that you become attached to is doomed, sooner or later.  You get two choices: meet your own doom without ever having been attached to something at all, or meet it with at least the memory of how good the ride was while it lasted.Rating:  ***1/2 out of ****.",9,1,2,8 October 1999
Lord of War," Stick to what you do best, Andrew
","Andrew Niccol is the greatest screenwriter of our generation. He thinks deeply, writes intelligently, and is blessed with an incredibly fertile imagination. Above all he has passion and isn't afraid to show it, when most writers today hide their real feelings, if they have any, behind cute, cynical inanities. When his screenplays end up in the hands of good directors, like Weir in The Truman Show or Spielberg in The Terminal, the result is a masterpiece. But, regrettably, Niccol feels driven to be a director himself, a trade for which he has no talent at all. In 2002's Simone, his hand on the helm hobbled his own brilliant script, reducing a potential all-time classic to an ordinary good movie. And now, directing his own script again for Lord of War, Niccol falls flat on his face.The story: If you've got money, Yuri Orlov can sell you guns. Or tanks, or helicopters, or whatever weapons you need. It's his job, and he's good at it. He sells African dictators the weapons they use to slaughter their own people. He sells arms to terrorists for their mass murder jobs (though not to Osama bin Laden, who is always bouncing checks). For some reason, although he will sell guns to anyone, good people never end up buying his wares. He uses his blood money to buy a beautiful wife, a nice home, and to support his drug-addicted brother Vitaly. The development of the plot is essentially a moral version of the Limbo: how low can Yuri go? This is not one of Niccol's best scripts. It suffers badly from the worst kind of political naiveté, the kind that imagines itself to be sophisticated, making profound insights like 'somebody makes money off guns,' while cluelessly confusing Liberia's HIV+ rate with Zimbabwe's, attributing non-existent arrest powers to Interpol, and equating the single misguided Bush v. Gore decision to the rampant every-election cheating of a Third World despotism. But the script still had potential to be good, as it studies Yuri's growing self-loathing, and his suspicion that his brother Vitaly's worthlessness stems from his shame for Yuri's way of life and his own failure to do anything about it. The best and most tragic scene, where Vitaly finally does take action both to stop and to save his brother Yuri, represents what the movie could have achieved. A better director than Niccol would have focused on these character-driven moments and ditched the naive political nonsense.But alas, thanks to Niccol's directing, character languishes in the background while sloppy political thinking stands is spotlighted. The essential problem is that nobody in the movie, Yuri least of all, honestly examines gun-running as a profession. Yuri tries once to justify himself by saying that he sells people the tools they need to defend themselves. In Yuri's case, that happens not to be true. His clients, or at least the ones we are shown, use their new-bought weapons to massacre political opponents, wipe out ethnic minorities, and otherwise commit mass murder, not for self-defense. But the movie never addresses the fact that lack of guns, and the arms embargoes that Agent Valentine castigates Yuri for violating, also can facilitate mass murder. For a famous recent example, an international arms embargo against Yugoslavia in the 1990s left Bosnian Muslims and Croats defenseless against Serbian nationalists bent on genocide, and the resulting carnage went on for years before the international community decided to do anything about it. Yuri's sin is his choice of customers, not his choice of merchandise.This basic error percolates. As the movie points out, private gun suppliers like Yuri are small potatoes on the world stage. The five members of the UN Security Council sell far more weapons than all the world's private dealers combined. What is not addressed is whether these nations behave like Yuri, arming any murderous psychotic with ready cash, or whether they can legitimately say that they are helping people defend themselves. It is again simply taken for granted that all arms dealing is evil.The movie loses the opportunity to examine the ethics of arms dealing through the underused character of Simeon Weisz. Weisz has some kind of ideological basis for his arms dealing, but it's not clear what it is. Weisz believes that 'Bullets change governments far surer than votes'  an absurd claim, as in fact challenger candidates win far more often than armed rebels do. Eventually Weisz ends up selling guns to the enemies of Baptiste, the African dictator that Yuri is arming (or I think he does, anyway; Baptiste denies it but is probably lying). But there is no clue whether Weisz has chosen to arm Baptiste's enemies because he is morally opposed to Baptiste's brutal rule, or merely because Yuri has beaten him to Baptiste's pocketbook.However, Niccol's direction has other flaws than self-indulgent and sloppy political moralizing. He has also taken an above-average actor, Nicolas Cage, and wrung a bad performance out of him. Cage is monotonous and shallow, with none of his trademark appealing vulnerability. I blame Niccol not only because Cage is normally better than this, but because the supporting players who get less directorial attention are mostly doing good jobs. Eammon Walker is commendable as the ruthless Andre Baptiste, Sr., and Ethan Hawke projects considerable frustration in the role of Agent Valentine. I feel his pain, for this movie is an intensely frustrating experience, despite occasional flashes of character insight.Rating: ** out of ****.Recommendation: TV fare for a VERY slow night.",5,1,3,14 August 2007
Signs," Malt does more than Shyamalan to justify God's ways to man
","Amazingly, SIGNS is worth seeing.  Writer-director M. Night Shyamalan uses all his skill to tell his message-laden story with beauty, passion, humor, and spine-tingling suspense.  I won't say that it doesn't matter that the story is absurd and that its message can't survive critical thought.  It does matter, just not as much as I would have expected.SIGNS' hero is Graham Hess, who lives on a beautiful farm in Pennsylvania with his brother and two young children.  Graham is an ex-minister who lost the faith after his wife died.  Now, strange things are happening all around him.  He finds his crops flattened into odd geometric patterns; tame dogs inexplicably turn savage; mysterious visitors appear on his roof and then vanish.  Then, similar events start happening all over the world.  As the family realizes that these signs could portend the extinction of the human race, Graham faces the question of whether the God he forsook is controlling these events, or if instead he and his family are facing the impending apocalypse alone.Shyamalan proved in THE SIXTH SENSE that he is a master of building tension, and that ability does not desert him in SIGNS.  Shyamalan lets the audience know no more than the Hess family knows, so the viewers share the characters' dread and bewilderment.  He also cunningly uses the tension generated by the bizarre phenomena going on around the Hesses to spark the tension between the characters themselves.But (and hereafter there are some spoilers vaguely hinting at the ending), regrettably, all this skill goes to support Shyamalan's untenable thesis: that there are no coincidences.  He is shilling for Alexander Pope's old nostrum: 'All Nature is but Art, unknown to thee / All chance, direction, which thou canst not see / All discord, harmony not understood / All partial evil, universal good.'  Thus, SIGNS would have us believe, it is not really a random tragedy when a young mother dies in a freak accident, but rather it is God's secret way of saving her son by using her last words to spark a life-saving plan in her distraught husband's mind months later.  Similar divine providence is suggested in a young boy's asthma and a little girl's fussiness about her water.  Apparently it did not occur to Shyamalan that a God who was really pre-ordaining the world in mankind's best interest would have found a way of saving the son that did not include killing his mother or inventing a disease that kills thousands of youngsters annually.  I could easily name five other 'coincidences' that would have saved the boy's life just as effectively without using any grisly tragedies, and if I had the omniscience traditionally attributed to God I could probably think of a few more than that.Nor is the vapid message SIGNS' only flaw.  The movie also undermines the sense of menace by representing the hostile aliens as idiots.  An advanced civilization  that has conquered the barriers of interstellar travel is portrayed as behaving in such a manner that Stone Age barbarians could have beaten them off.  Indeed, they are so ineffective that not until the movie is almost over is it clear that they are hostile at all.  The aliens' weakness is a weapon that Earth obviously possesses in abundance, but the aliens don't take any precautions against it, not even the precautions that humans invented in their prehistory.  The Hess family's defensive measures would not have discouraged a good Roman centurion and his men, but they are able to stop hypertechnological creatures cold.  These absurdities don't just make the movie implausible, but also rob it of any lasting impact.  You don't walk away from the theater shivering at what you have just seen; you walk away hoping that any interstellar invaders that may someday happen by our planet are as incompetent as the ones in the movie.Was Mel Gibson good?  Of course he was; you didn't need me to tell you that. All the other actors do well except Shyamalan himself; he takes on too large a role and delivers a flat, robotic performance.  Unfortunately, that kind of acting is routinely praised as 'understated' by people who forget that you can't 'understate' something you didn't say to start with.SIGNS is also surprisingly funny at times, and none of the jokes misses its target.  A lazy writer would have written a cardboard buffoon into the script to provide comic relief; Shyamalan took the trouble to make each of his characters dramatic and comic by turns, and the movie is much better for it.There is no getting around the fact that SIGNS is a failure.  It's on a mission to convince its audience and will not do so; the only people nodding their heads will be those who were already convinced before they watched the film.  But the movie is such a pretty, humorous, and tautly made failure that it's enjoyable anyway.Rating: ** 1/2 out of ****Recommendation: Watch on video or DVD on a slow night.",Null,0,1,9 October 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Why did THIS one win the Oscar?
","Fellowship of the Ring was far and away the best of the three Lord of the Rings movies, and the Academy snubbed it.  The Two Towers was far less impressive, but that was understandable since the book of the Two Towers is the weakest of the original trilogy, and Jackson saved one of its best episodes, the confrontation between the hobbits and Shelob, for the third film.  The third film rebounds, as it ought to have given that the third book is the best, but it does not reach the level reached by the first movie, much less by the book.  Overall, Jackson did a good job, none of the movies is bad, and he deserves recognition for his work and the risks he took.  It's just hard not to feel disappointed, given the huge promise of the first movie, to find that the trilogy as a whole is quite good but nowhere near great.Certainly Jackson achieved a very impressive feat in constructing battle scenes that are even more exciting and terrifying than the excellent ones in the previous two movies.  The assault of Grond on the gate of Minas Tirith, the wild charge of the Rohirrim, the confrontation between Eowyn and the Lord of the Nazgul, and the desperate clash with the Oliphaunts are probably the finest fantasy warfare sequences ever filmed, managing to be intimate and detailed while also giving a sense of the overall strategic picture of the battle.  Kurosawa would have been hard put to do better.Too, Jackson pulled a major coup by constructing a version of the climactic scene at Mount Doom that will surprise the readers of the original book without disappointing them  and it would have been very easy to go wrong at this point.  And, Jackson manages a few times to do what he did with astonishing regularity in The Fellowship of the Ring: spot the dramatic moments and give them even more impact on film than they have on the printed page.  His version of the scenes in the Paths of the Dead and the lighting of the beacons of Gondor are masterful.But, Jackson has lost his eye for character; indeed, he has lost it so disastrously that I have to wonder whether his master portraits of Boromir and Gandalf in the first film were anything more than luck.  This is clearest in his revolting representation of Denethor.  Jackson's Denethor is a cretin: weak, craven, stupid, self-pitying, insensitive, spiteful, utterly devoid of redeeming features.  No man cut from this cloth could have lasted a month as Steward of Gondor, much less raised two of the boldest warriors of Minas Tirith or pitted his will against the Dark Lord Sauron for control of a Palantir.  The true story of Denethor, which Jackson misunderstood completely, is not of the crumbling of a coward, but what is infinitely more tragic, the crumbling of a brave man.Meanwhile, Gandalf has receded into Old Testament prophet mode, and seems to have no emotions of his own whatsoever.  Granted, even in the books Gandalf seems more distant and unapproachable after his reappearance, but he still had the old irritability and humor underneath.  Arwen, after being used so well in the first movie, again becomes an annoying hindrance to the plot. Gimli, at least, has improved somewhat since The Two Towers; he is still being used as comic relief, but the humor is now more of a deliberately self-deprecating kind than the humiliating pratfall jokes he had to suffer through last time.Also, I have to complain about some of the things that Jackson left out.  I will concede that he was right to omit two of my favorite parts: the meeting with Ghan-buri-Ghan and the Scouring of the Shire; time was limited, and something had to be cut.  (he could have omitted the Paths of the Dead too, if he'd had to, although that would have been a shame considering how well he did that sequence).  But the confrontation between Gandalf and the Witch-King of Angmar at the ruins of the Gate could have been done in thirty seconds, and the parley with the Mouth of Sauron would have required less than one minute to deliver one of the dramatic high points of the whole book.That Minas Tirith, Mount Doom, and the Grey Havens are magnificently done almost goes without saying.  Art direction has been the one consistent strong point throughout this whole trilogy.In all, The Return of the King is a good movie.  Certainly far worse ones have won Oscars.  I just hope that the award doesn't lead to people imagining that this is the best movie of the trilogy.Rating: *** out of ****.Recommendation:  Go see it on a big screen.  But watch The Fellowship of the Ring first.",Null,22,39,8 April 2004
The Matrix," It's been done better before
","The first half of THE MATRIX is pretty darn good.  After a bizarre and surreal action sequence where the black-clad Trinity (Carrie-Ann Moss) displays superhuman abilities in eluding some Men In Black who also have superhuman abilities, we meet the plot.  He is called Neo (Keanu Reeves), who finds himself being contacted by two seemingly omniscient characters: the aforementioned Trinity and a man called Morpheus whom we at first know only by his voice.  They try, not always successfully, to guide Neo out of the danger posed by the Men In Black (who we learn are called Agents, but Men In Black gives you a better idea of what they look like).The movie to this point is great fun, with a palpable aura of mystery making your pulse pound as you wonder what the explanation is for what's happening to Neo.  Better yet, the explanation we get from Morpheus is actually moderately imaginative and makes at least some sense (although one wonders how humans can live without a solar-based food chain beneath them; I can't explain more without giving too much away).Unfortunately, at this point, THE MATRIX is only halfway done.  The second half is a nonstop pastiche of action cliches and mystical mumbo-jumbo, as Neo, supposedly the most important person in the world for Morpheus to find, actually achieves very little other than to become your routine Hollywood superhero and pull off a depressingly prosaic rescue mission.  Characters come back from the dead literally by magic, or with no explanation at all. The action sequences are competently done, with an eerie musical backdrop sounded out by cartridge cases clinking against the floor, but they can't disguise the essential problem: THE MATRIX runs out of plot an hour before it ends.Keanu Reeves is not improving with age; the way he expresses disbelief will have you expressing your own disbelief, and there is no chemistry between him and the attractive Moss.  Laurence Fishburne's character is poorly sketched, leaving him nothing to do except be very, very cool, but he does that very well.  Moss does her action scenes with verve, but delivers her dialogue weakly.  Hugo Weaving, playing one of the Men In Black, is sinister, inhuman, and a lot of fun to watch.  A number of supporting characters who assist Trinity and Morpheus are well played.Regrettably, THE MATRIX is yet another case of Hollywood putting excellent production values into creating a half-baked story.  The same themes were much better examined just last year, in THE TRUMAN SHOW and DARK CITY.  And by no means does this film deserve comparison to BLADE RUNNER, whose plot dealt with the line between man and machine in a way that this movie never approaches.  THE MATRIX is mildly entertaining, but still greatly overrated.Rating: ** out of ****.",5,1,2,23 August 1999
Cube," CUBE is always unsettling, often terrifying
","This movie is not fun.  The picture it paints of humanity is very dark, ugly, and disturbing.  But it contains far too many elements of truth to be dismissed.  This is one of the very few movies ever to give me insomnia. I was badly shaken.CUBE's plot is simple.  A handful of strangers wake up inside a strange machine, a sort of maze consisting of 14-foot cubical rooms, some of which contain deadly, sadistic traps.  They have no idea how they came here, or what the place is for.  The story is simply of their efforts to survive and escape from the maze.  But a darker story is told simultaneously, as the growing tension and strain strip away the veneer of each character to expose what lies below.  A character who initially appears useless and annoying turns out to have hidden courage; a character who at first seems heroic is revealed to be anything but.The tragedy of CUBE is the energy the characters spend in conflict with each other when they so clearly need to work together to overcome the daunting obstacles of the maze.  The mismatched-partners concept is old, of course, but in most movies it is played for humor; in CUBE, it is shown as deadly. The story is a microcosm of the human predicament.  Humans understand what they are doing in this world little (if any) better than the characters understand what they are doing in the Cube.  Our planet is full of dangers that can and eventually do kill every one of us, just as the Cube is.  Yet, humans the world over continue to fight each other instead of cooperating to understand and overcome the problems the world throws at us.  That behavior is so routine that most of us have long since ceased to notice it or think it odd; by showing it in miniature, CUBE puts the absurdity of our actions in sharp focus.Another foolish human habit exposed by CUBE is the characters' tendency to reason from inadequate evidence to whatever conclusion fits their preconceived notions, a failing which proves as dangerous in the movie as it does in real life.The criticisms you have read about CUBE's mathematical implausibilities are true.  They certainly make the movie imperfect, but I don't see how they can be regarded as ruining it.  At any rate, CUBE presents one mathematical statement that brooks no argument (and here there is a SPOILER).  The Cube is one of the ghastliest, cruelest killing machines ever conceived, and yet when the carnage is totaled up at the end of the story, the score is: Humans 4, Cube 2.",Null,0,1,6 January 2003
The Thin Red Line," Pretty, but empty and pretentious
","THE THIN RED LINE is the story of Company C, a U.S. Army unit during the World War II battle of Guadalcanal.  It must attack a hill occupied by Japanese soldiers.  You now know the entire plot of THE THIN RED LINE, and yes, it is every bit as boring as it sounds.THE THIN RED LINE is subject to the same critique as THE PHANTOM MENACE: it's nobody's story.  Most of the characters (with two merciful exceptions) are boring and literally interchangeable; more than one reviewer has confused one character with another.The voice-over narration consists of maundering banalities disguised as philosophy.  At one point one of the G.I. narrators (who?  who knows or cares?) mumbles, 'Who's killing us?'  The Japanese soldiers are killing you, of course!  And you're killing them!  What could be more obvious or banal? Another pompously suggests that all humans are part of one universal soul. Are we seriously to believe that two men such as Col. Tall and Cap. Staros, with such different outlooks on life and diametrically opposite reactions to violence, have the same 'soul?'Oddly for a movie so obsessed with imagery (particularly of the lush jungle), THE THIN RED LINE consistently tells us what is happening to the characters, rather than showing us.  Officers beg for water for their men, lest the poor sods pass out, but we never see a soldier pass out or even gulp the last drip from a canteen.  Show us, Malick!  Show us the crusted salt dried on the baked skin of a man who has no water left in his body for sweat!  Show us the field surgeon losing his ability to care what happens to the men, don't just have him tell us about it!  Show us Arnold Schwarzenegger getting blown to pieces while Rick Moranis survives, don't give us a line like, 'No matter how strong or well trained you are, if you're in the wrong place at the wrong time, you're going to get it.' Show us what's happening to the people, not to the !@#$% papaya tree!The movie is also scandalously inaccurate.  Any war veterans in the audience will giggle to see two dozen Japanese voluntarily surrender to Company C alone.  In reality, Japanese soldiers were almost never captured alive, and when they were it was usually because they were too badly hurt to resist further.  Even worse is the portrayal of the native Solomon Islanders, who are made out as living a serene and peaceful life untouched by the war. In fact, the natives of Guadalcanal were very unhappy about being invaded by the Japanese, and made crucial contributions to the American victory by carrying water, ammunition and other supplies to the troops, rescuing American wounded, and as coastwatchers warning the G.I.'s of attack by air or sea.  All of this was at great risk to their lives.  The movie's treatment of them as passive flower children is inaccurate, patronizing and downright insulting.  Also, the idea of a soldier with multiple AWOL offenses not being court-martialled is absurd.  This is World War II, when they shot Private Slovik for desertion.In all fairness, the cinematography is breathtaking.  Also, the acting is uniformly high-quality, with Nick Nolte as Col. Tall and Elias Koteas as Cap. Staros providing very strong performances, especially considering the weakness of the script they had to work with.  The battle scenes are kinetic, giving you the feeling you are charging alongside the troops, and they manage to convey some pathos despite the film's refusal to let us connect with the characters.  Only these elements save THE THIN RED LINE from being a total loss.Bloody but detached, contemplative but witless, visually beautiful but emotionally dead, THE THIN RED LINE is not worth renting.  Hard-core film buffs might want to watch it on TV for the acting and for John Toll's flawless cinematographic technique.Rating:  ** out of ****.",5,88,132,19 August 1999
Gangs of New York," A trail-blazing movie - hopefully, those that follow the trail will be still better
","In 1846 New York City, the native gangs and the foreign (mostly Irish) gangs meet to fight an awful battle for supremacy.  The natives are victorious and the Irish leader, Priest Vallon, is slain by the terrible Bill Cutting. Vallon's son, Amsterdam, is dispatched to an orphanage and emerges in 1862 to find most of his Irish fellows subjugated (but cared for) by Bill and his native gang.  Amsterdam joins Bill's gang and begins to rise through the ranks.The United States' stories of its own creation have almost invariably been Westerns.  GANGS OF NEW YORK pioneers a needed new genre: the Eastern. Without the East, there would have been no conquest of the West.  Some of the most famous figures in the history of the West were actually Easterners, such as a New York City boy named Henry McCarty who moved to Arizona and became known as Billy the Kid.  As this movie demonstrates, the West had no monopoly on lawlessness and violence.  The 19th century East also deserves its larger-than-life heroes and villains, and GANGS OF NEW YORK tries to fill that need.The movie duly sets about creating the atmosphere and archetypes which will inhabit the land of the Eastern.  If Westerns are stories of ranches and railroads, then Easterns will be stories of cities and ships.  Just as the frontier landscape itself is a character in every Western, the city streets of New York itself live and breathe in this Eastern (kudos to Scorsese for shunning CGI sets in favor of real ones wherever possible).  While the West is a place of vast empty spaces, home to the lonely Indian of Fraser's `The End of the Trail,' Scorsese's East is a teeming warren of pugnacious immigrant tribes stepping on each other's toes, with open warfare avoided only by a brutal pecking order where every man exacts his `due and proper' from the man below.  Patrick Buchanan ought to see this movie depict how his own Irish Catholic forbears were treated with the same anti-immigrant prejudice that he now directs against modern-day newcomers to America.Another important part of the Eastern atmosphere is the language - `stargazer,' `turtledove,' `blodgett,' `dustup' -  that gives it a unique sense of time and place.  Not even the characters themselves understand all the local argot; when a gangster calls Amsterdam a `fiddling ben,' Amsterdam replies that he might be insulted if he knew what the epithet meant.  The soundtrack includes a number of enchanting songs; it is true that some are anachronistic and jarring, but even these are beautiful.The outstanding creation of GANGS OF NEW YORK is its villain, Daniel Day Lewis's Bill Cutting, a butcher by trade who slaughters both pigs and human beings with unsentimental expertise.  Lewis's performance ought to garner him an Oscar and will be the standard by which future Eastern villains are judged.  Bill the Butcher is terrifying, sadistic, bigoted, and evil.  He is also brave, strong, and capable of real caring for his underlings.  He manifests genuine respect for his victim, Priest Vallon.  In one scene, he artfully suggests that a corrupt policeman's reluctance to do his bidding is as hypocritical as a butcher crying over a slaughtered rabbit.  Scorsese has certainly taken to heart Hitchcock's maxim that a movie can only be as good as its villain.Unfortunately, GANGS OF NEW YORK is not quite as good as its villain, because it lacks a great hero to balance against him.  Leonardo DiCaprio does his best, and it is surprising how far his acting and his goatee go to toughen up his pretty-boy persona.  But Amsterdam is simply not a well-written protagonist.  He is impenetrable and uncompelling.  At the end of the movie, I understand no better why `the blood stays on the blade' than I did at the beginning.  Those who have seen Michael Corleone's voyage from good to evil will find Amsterdam's tribulations tedious and trite by comparison.Also unsatisfactory is the lady lead, Cameron Diaz' Jenny Everdeane. Jenny is even more inscrutable than Amsterdam.  I could not understand what attracted her to Amsterdam, and evidently Amsterdam doesn't either. Again, this is not Diaz' fault; she acts what she is given superbly.  She just isn't given much.The supporting cast is great.  Dominated by Lewis, it also features Jim Broadbent as Tammany Hall's Boss Tweed.  I ended up liking the politician Tweed more than most of the characters in the movie; he is corrupt and has no nobler motive than to line his own pockets, but at least he does so chiefly by helping the immigrants, not by stamping them down as others do. Other standouts are Liam Neeson as Amsterdam's father and Brendan Gleeson as Monk McGinn.Perhaps the uninspired presentation of Amsterdam and Jenny, contrasted with the powerful portrayal of Bill, reflects an overall problem with American cinema: we have become fascinated with evil, and regard goodness as dull. This does not have to be so. (See LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL for a man who is good and who is also fascinating and delightful to watch).  Here is where Scorsese's Eastern has not yet matched the Western.  Westerns deal with ranchers raising cattle, cowboys driving them, laborers building railroads, sodbusters growing their crops, lawmen chasing down bank robbers; in short, people making the West a better place than they found it.  If the criminals in GANGS OF NEW YORK had anything to do with changing America from a fledgling colony into a superpower, Scorsese doesn't show it to us.Scorsese presents us with a grand setting, populated by wonderful characters, on which little takes place besides senseless violence.  The movie is good, but I don't think many people will mistake it for great. Still, GANGS OF NEW YORK has launched the Eastern, and that is an important accomplishment.  Better plays will someday be performed on the stage that Scorsese has built here.Rating: *** out of ****.Recommendation:  See it in the theater if you have a strong stomach for violence.",Null,0,0,9 January 2003
Braveheart," Awe-inspiring and uplifting film
","It was a favorite dictum of the late science fiction writer Robert Heinlein that a free man can be killed but never conquered.  This is the guiding idea behind BRAVEHEART, and makes the movie a much truer rendition of Heinlein's thought than either of the two movies putatively based on his works (THE PUPPET MASTERS and STARSHIP TROOPERS).The story, very loosely based on historical fact, follows the 13th-century figure of William Wallace, native to a Scotland living under English domination.  Wallace tries to ignore the brutality and oppression of the English lords, and is repaid by the loss of his wife, who is murdered for the sole purpose of luring Wallace into English hands.  Concluding that he and his countrymen can only live in peace if they are free of English domination, Wallace leads a revolt against the English king, Edward I 'Longshanks.'  An ensemble of Scottish lords, including the leading candidate for the Scottish throne, make common cause with Wallace, but their loyalty is sometimes questionable.Mel Gibson gives a robust and sincere performance as Wallace, but it is his direction that truly shines.  His battle scenes are powerful and brutal, pulling no punches, showing the Scots' fight for freedom as a grim and agonizing experience.  The warriors are glorified, but not the war.  But Gibson does not skimp on screen time for the supporting characters, who are rich and varied.  Angus MacFadyen, as would-be king of Scotland Robert the Bruce, paints a fascinating portrait of a tortured man whose conscience weans him away from the cynical political maneuvers his father is teaching him.  Parallel to him is Sophie Marceau as Princess Isabella of France, King Edward's daughter-in-law, who finds Wallace more admirable and appealing than her own family.  Brendan Gleeson portrays Wallace's friend Hamish, an ox of a man with few brains but plenty of guts.  David O'Hara steals every scene he's in with his hilarious, lunatic turn as Wallace's ally Stephen.BRAVEHEART raises some interesting questions.  How much humiliation and oppression can be tolerated before it becomes worth fighting against?  Is the Scots' struggle for freedom worth the blood and pain that it costs them? How much of what is precious to you can you give up to save your life, before that life ceases to be worth living, or saving?This movie has been rightly criticized for its lack of historical accuracy. 'Prima nottae' (actually called 'jus primae noctis') was never instituted in 13th-century Scotland; the battle of Stirling was fought at a bridge crossing, not an open field; the Scots didn't 'charge the field' at Bannockburn but stayed wisely on the defensive, etc.  However, the details are not as far off as some would have you believe. King Edward is rightly shown as distracted with his wars with Philip IV in France; his son is correctly portrayed undermining his own leadership by giving cushy jobs to his lovers; the Scottish nobles' subservience to the English throne is realistic; the Scottish reliance on spears against the English cavalry is accurate.  BRAVEHEART is a poor history lesson, but it is no worse than average for Hollywood.Randall Wallace's script, aside from its historical faults, is tender, warmly humorous, and touching.  John Toll, whose cinematography was nearly the only redeeming feature of THE THIN RED LINE, brings the medieval Scottish landscape magnificently to life.  James Horner provides a beautifully melodious score.There are few films that generate such respect and admiration for their characters.  Wounded, bleeding, losing their loved ones, and often losing their battles, the Scots symbolized by Wallace refuse to stop laughing, loving, or fighting.  Their story, embroidered with historical falsehoods though it is, is irresistibly compelling.Rating: ***1/2 out of ****.",9,1,2,23 August 1999
True Romance," Sleazy, mindless trash
","(Minor spoilers)Tarantinolatry got so out of hand during the '90s that a number of people actually took this absurd movie for a masterstroke, even though Tarantino only wrote the screenplay for it.Clarence Worley is a nebbish who meets Alabama who is (sigh) a Hooker With A Heart Of Gold.  They decide to get married.  It becomes necessary to kill Alabama's pimp, Drexl (Gary Oldman, whose amusing performance is one of the few enjoyable moments in the movie) so the pair can be together.  However, they decide to grab Drexl's huge stash of cocaine to finance their future together.  Needless to say, this causes a plethora of criminals to try to kill them and get the drugs back.  Also needless to say, the plethora fails to do so.  Clarence magically transforms from a nebbish into a Tough Guy, whose strength is as the strength of ten because he spouts 'cool' profanities.  When you spout cool profanities, gangsters who are pointing their guns at you do not shoot you when you draw a gun.  They just rack their slides menacingly (this cliche is known to bad movie fans as Superfluous Racking).Clarence and Alabama do not have any interesting or memorable characteristics.  There is no reason for the audience to root for them to make it to the end.  Who wants to see these two who intend to finance their married life by helping some hapless addict kill himself (or worse, helping to start some kid on the habit), enjoy the fruits of their scheme?  Cliche characters alone do not make the movie any worse than an ordinary action movie, but these characters are not just cliches, but unlikeable cliches. 
Nor do the supporting characters make any more sense than the leads. Christopher Walken's Vince Coccotti tortures Clarence's father in order to learn where Clarence is, and then, bizarrely, kills him without first gaining any information whatsoever from him.  But first, we are subjected to a reprehensible, epithet-laden racist spiel from Clarence's dad, apparently intended to be funny.  Unlike in PULP FICTION, where the racial epithets could be excused as not meant to be offensive, there is no question in this case that Clarence's dad, who is being painted as a 'good guy' and is intended to engage the audience's sympathy, is deliberately trying to provoke Coccotti by suggesting that he has black ancestors (and it is presumed as a matter of course that an implication of black ancestry is belittling and undesirable).  If this were even the slightest bit amusing, it might be forgivable, but it isn't, despite the laughter of the characters on screen which is intended to cue the audience into laughter in much the same way as the canned laughter on a TV sitcom.  TRUE ROMANCE could have been a bland action movie.  By ladling on racism, an extra helping of unrealism and stupidity, and characters who are not only unimaginative but also repellent, it makes itself much, much worse.  Wish fulfillment movies can be pleasant, even if silly; the shape of Tarantino's wish fulfillment fantasy is disgusting.Rating: * out of ****.",2,28,73,16 February 2000
Gladiator," Things I like about GLADIATOR (warning: spoilers)
","1.  The battle scenes.  Even on second viewing, they had me on the edge of my seat, teeth locked, fists clenched.  'Are you not entertained?'  Maximus demands.  Yup, I sure was.  I was scared, horrified, nerve-wracked and at times revolted.  But bored?  Hell, no!2.  Marcus Aurelius.  In every other movie that shows Caesar Marcus Aurelius, the director slobbers all over him and makes him out as an all-wise philosopher.  Ridley Scott portrays him more like what I feel he was: a well-intentioned fool.3.  There are NO CHRISTIANS in this movie!  Scott broke Rule One in Roman-Epic-Making, which saith the plot must be at least tangentially about conflict between persecuted Christians and evil heathens.  Of course, Christianity in Imperial Rome started out as just an insignificant player among many, many cults.  For once we not only get a hero who isn't a Christian, but a hero who is devoutly and warmly pious in the old pagan traditions.4.  The acting.  Everybody does a wonderful job.  Crowe is so subtle that Phoenix upstages him, but they're both excellent.  Crowe, as always, is a master at hinting at deep thoughts that just barely ripple the surface of his face.  Phoenix gives us a wonderful villain, provoking both pity and disgust, whose footsteps on the path from good to evil are clearly visible behind him.  Nielsen, Jacobi, and Hounsou all enrich the movie, and even Harris (perfectly cast) gives a good performance.  And Oliver Reed is delightful; if he is playing himself, as the stories about him suggest, then he must have been an interesting man to know.  It took a lot of good acting to rescue some of the lamer dialogue, but by God they did it.5.  The coliseum.  Some of the rest of Rome looked too colorless and washed out to be believable, but the coliseum was spectacular.  And those tigers! How magnificent!  This truly was the 'grandeur that was Rome.'6.  Tragedy.  Not only does Maximus die, but his death achieves almost nothing.  We know the Republic will never be restored, the 'light' that is Rome will be snuffed in the Dark Ages, the dream will die.  But Maximus has kept his integrity; he has fulfilled his word to his emperor by seeing that Commodus will not rule Rome; he has done his part to try to restore the Republic, even if it is in vain, and that may not be such a small achievement.7.  Hans Zimmer's score.  Somebody said he lifted it; I don't know if that's true, but if he did then he lifted it from the right place.  It's simple and powerful, perfectly chosen for the scenes.  The Celtic wailing was a bit much at times, but I don't think Zimmer did that part.8.  A small touch, but a good one.  Lucilla, bending over the dying Maximus, does not say 'I love you,' which she surely must have been thinking. Instead, she says 'Go to them.'  Which, when you think about it, is really a much better demonstration of how much she cared about Maximus than the more obvious line would have been.And some things I didn't like...1.  The ending.  Ten points for having the guts to kill the hero off.  But Lucilla's and Gracchus' 'truly this was the noblest Roman of them all'-type posturing was pompous and unnecessary.  If we had to have an epitaph, it would have been better just to have Lucius say one sentence: 'There will be no more games as long as I reign.'  Of course that would probably be historically inaccurate, but since when did that ever stop a good storyteller?2.  Tigers Lite?  An adult male tiger weighs 500 pounds.  I don't care if you're Arnold Schwarzenegger, if one of those things jumps on your back, you're going DOWN and staying there.3.  Maximus' home.  Farmers that stand immobile, a mother and child we never get to know before they die.  It all sounded so much better when Maximus described it then when we saw it.But I'm just carping to show that I paid attention.  GLADIATOR's a magnificent movie.  For heaven's sake, fork over the money to see it on the big screen.",8,0,0,4 July 2000
The Godfather," A very good movie about very bad people
","Throughout history, well-intentioned men have committed many horrible crimes in the name of their mother countries.  THE GODFATHER is about a well-intentioned man named Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) who learns to commit horrible crimes in the name of his family.The Godfather is Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) who heads one of the most powerful crime families in New York.  He has three sons: hot-tempered Santino (James Caan), weak-willed Fredo (John Cazale), and Michael. 'Michael,' significantly, is the only Anglicized name of the three.  Michael is the only son who fought for the Americans in World War II, and the only one who wants nothing to do with the family crime business.  He is something of an outsider to his family.But Michael is devoted to his father.  And when Vito is severely wounded in an attempted assassination by drug dealer Virgil 'the Turk' Sollozzo, who thinks Vito's heir apparent Santino will be readier to deal with him, then Michael saves his life.  Later, Michael murders the Turk and his hired police bodyguard, knowing that he will have to flee to Sicily for breaking the unwritten truce between the police and the Mafia.The saga of Michael's rise to head the Corleone family is one of the most fascinating stories ever told on screen.  It is hard to tell a good story about evil, but Coppola succeeds, principally because he shows the sincere devotion to family that lies behind the characters' deeds.  Michael is slowly corrupted into a cold-hearted killer, not by laziness or indifference or any other vice, but by his defining virtue: his love for his father and brothers!  Likewise, Santino comes to grief as a direct result of his only redeeming feature, his devotion to his sister.  This tragic irony suffuses the film.  The viewer thus can forgive the characters somewhat for their crimes, because the life they have been born into gives them a choice between violent crime and abandoning their loved ones.Nino Rota's sad, haunting score is superb, and his Siciliana theme is beautiful and tender.  The supporting performances are superb, particularly Abe Vigoda and Richard Castellano as the Godfather's tough but genial caporegimes, Robert Duvall as the 'consigliere' or Mafia lawyer, and Al Lettieri as Sollozzo.  Luca Brasi unfortunately disappears too quickly; his role was more fleshed out in Puzo's original novel.Enter a world where murder is 'not personal.  It's strictly business.'  You will never forget it.Rating: **** out of ****.",10,1,2,2 September 1999
