Ford v Ferrari," Amazing - Best Picture Worthy
","I've gotta say that I came to the theatre with lower expectations since some people were complaining about the story sounding boring. I only to came to watch because it had two of my favorite actors in it, Christian Bale and Matt Damon. After the movie was done, I was blown away.The story is exactly what it says, but those words can't describe the experience of watching this. Right away you get to know the characters and they're not so generic as I thought they would be. Christian Bale was the best part of this film, and his performance is very compelling. It feels totally separate from what he was in the Dark Knight and American Psycho.As time passes, the stakes get much higher. There are always barriers added along the way, whether it's the dangerous conditions of racing or the people involved in it. You will definitely love some characters and hate some as well (you'll know who I'm talking about).This is the ideal drama we should keep getting from Hollywood. The performances by Bale and Damon are fantastic, and this'll bring many awards.",9,3,6,17 November 2019
Knives Out," Absolutely Surprised
","Before I start, I have to say that at first, I was hesitant on watching a film directed by Rian Johnson. I was disappointed after seeing The Last Jedi, and so I slightly lowered expectations, even with a good score.
What I noticed right away is that the casting was excellent despite it sounding unusual to be in the role based on their previous roles. The characters are likable despite their actions because each of them have their own unique characteristics.The story is a straightforward murder mystery but it's not as serious as others. There is a lot of humor in the movie and it's not one of the cringey ones. This is one of the funnier films of this year and most of the audience including me had a good laugh.How everything is setup and executed in this film, especially character introductions, flashbacks and reveals were well done. It's not generic. I highly recommend it, even if you don't like the director or these types of movies.",10,1,4,28 November 2019
Logan," Probably the best marvel movie
","I was so surprised that movies could be this good. They put all the action sequences and everything properly in two hours. The story was great and the character were fantastic. It is hard to believe that there are a few people out there that dislike this movie. Just like Deadpool, this movie filled me with excitement as I watched it.",9,2,6,3 March 2017
Jojo Rabbit," A lot of heart
","At first sight of the trailer, I cringed at what looked like a spoof of Hitler and a boy scout and I expected the same while watching the movie. I was surprised to find out, it was so much more. I've seen too many blockbusters and it's time I experimented more, with different genres. This movie was fantastic.So apparently this is mostly satire and then some serious stuff. It's not supposed to clash well, especially when Adolf Hitler is the comic relief. They some how made it work but I'm not sure some people in the audiences felt that. I laughed at one of the darker jokes and realized no-one else was laughing, but then again, that's what you should expect. Not all of it was dark humor as they added some lighthearted jokes, which is one of the reasons why I appreciate this film.What really makes this film stand out are the characters such as, Jojo, Elsa, the mother, and Yorki. What I wasn't expecting was getting attached to the characters and actually caring for them. These were portrayed as darker times and there were a lot of people who deserved so much better. The film tries to break norms from the past by having a 'Nazi' boy befriending a Jewish girl. It continues to ridicule the beliefs that Nazis had about Jews, and that's part of its humor.If you would get offended by what the film seems to portray at first sight, then you should avoid this. To the others, this is a recommended watch.",9,2,7,10 November 2019
