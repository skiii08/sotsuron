Hereditary," Takes a lot of imagination to make this seem good
","The movie was very slow to develop and the course of haphazard events led up to a vague ending, the son could have died earlier in the movie along with the daughter, the fact that it dragged on with trivial filler just made it worse. Why wait all these years if all that's needed is for the daughter and son to die. It doesn't give much dept into why or how the son was a heir to the throne or what he is doing beyond that or why the original king died if he was already in hell.",4,2,3,6 August 2019
