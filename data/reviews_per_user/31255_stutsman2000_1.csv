Sucker Punch," This is the worst film since Trespass
","If you pay money to see this film, you will feel like someone sucker punched you. I'm not kidding. Don't do it. Just...Don't.The first 3 minutes are incredible, I'm not gonna lie, and then it sinks in, a little at a time, the director of this film lost the story in all of the effects and style. He's filming an hour and a half long music video now, shot like a video game with pointless, overwrought fight scenes spreading through wasted genres in retarded ways: A WW2 bomber on a WW1 battlefield, chasing a Dragon while fighting off Zombie Nazis with M16s; wearing modern comm. headsets, but always yelling to one another.The best things about this film were the solid performances by Gena Malone, Carla Gugina and Oscar Isaac.DO NOT pay to SEE THIS FILM!",4,4,12,29 March 2011
