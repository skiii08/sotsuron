Iron Man 3," Iron man has come to an end
","This movie is better than the second chapter of the legacy, since the action and also the enemy to fight are more solid.
In this chapter the relationship with Pepper is deepened and it will bring the Iron man thing to an end.
Stark had planned the end of Iron man project, this time has come in this movie.
To defeat this enemy all the resources from Tony had to be deployed to succeed.I would recommend this third movie instead of the second one.
After the credits, there is always a Marvel treat....this time with the green doctor.",7,1,2,23 March 2020
The Maze Runner," Run to survive
","This movie is original and you can have a plot twist one after another.
It's thrilling and sometimes is scary, it's a good mix of both genres.
Actors despite the young age perform quite well.
In this movie we can see a tight bond between people trying to survive.I recommend this movie since it's something new and do not bore you at all",7,0,0,24 March 2020
Iron Man 2," Iron man is back again
","Second chapter of the legacy of Iron Man. This time the enemy is from Russia and he is physics like his father.
In this movie Tony goes deeper in the relationship with is father, and he is able to get the way to synthesize a new element to keep himself alive from Palladium toxicity.
Scarlett Johansson and Gwyneth Paltrow are able to stand by the eccentric character of Robert Downey jr, and this is not easy at all.A little bit disappointed for the final battle, short and not complicated for Stark.",7,0,0,22 March 2020
Inception," So mental that can be compared to Lost series
","This movie is exceptional, it brings me back to JJ abrams series. As soon as the characters start to go deeper in the dreams, the plot begin to be so complicated with records, relationships, everything that can blow your mind.
Going ahead it's easy to loose the perception of reality and dreams, it's exactly what the director what and it succeeds so wellThis movie is no something to relax after a tough day at work, you need to be mind ready to understand the plot and do not loose the contact with reality.
PS: in my opinion at the end he is back in the reality",8,1,2,25 March 2020
Iron Man," Nice mix of action and humour
","This movie is well directed and its rhythm is almost constant during all the duration. Tony Stark is so funny when he talks to people, especially to his assistant Pepper. He is also tech enthusiast and so passionate about manufacturing new devices.The cherry on the cake is the last scene after the end credits is NIck Fury from the Avengers asking Tony to join.If you like superhero, Marvel or Robert Downey Jr you cannot miss this movie at all",8,0,0,22 March 2020
