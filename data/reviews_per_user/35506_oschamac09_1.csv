Come and See," In war No one wins
",Come and See is one of the most powerful movies I have ever seen. Not only does it tell the story of the war between Russia and Nazi Germany but tells the story of millions of people in Byelorrusia through the story of a young naive boy. The 'naive-ness' of this boy ironically enough is lost through the world of a war. The movie is full of close-ups and even scary images of what war can do to anyone even a young boy who is at the dawn of his life. The movie makes sure not to glorify war and violence but shows the horrifying effects. Even though the movie is based on World War II it can still relate to todays events. War never seems to cease like the war in Iraq or Afghanistan. The soldiers over there aren't having a blast or being 'Army Strong' they are fighting for their own lives. Watching their friends get shot. People dying. People crying. People asking for help. Going into the military just like the boy of 'Come and See' without a clue of war truly is. The movie is a masterpiece. It makes a statement. In war NOBODY wins not even if the newspapers say it or the losing side lost more soldiers. Lives are always lost and can only damage people not even if the soldiers survive the war they still have to live with it for the rest of their lives.,9,1,1,8 February 2011
