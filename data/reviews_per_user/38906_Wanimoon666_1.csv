Miracle," Definitely the Best Movie This Year!!!
","I definitely feel that this movie is and will be the best of 2004. Kurt Russel's portrayal of Herb Brooks is amazing and I definitely think it is his best role ever. This movie really shows how America was suffering in 1980 and how this unbelievable moment made everyone believe that things would be okay...that anything is possible if we just would believe. I was truly amazed on how well this movie was casted and how average Hockey players depicted such an amazing role of the 1980's Olympic Hockey Team. The acting was much better than expected. Everything about the movie was perfect, even the way they used actual audio commentary during the game was amazing. I think I cried most of the was through the movie because of how emotionally stimulating it was. This movie was definitely one of Disney's best and I highly advise everyone to see it, even if you don't like Hockey.",10,0,0,8 February 2004
