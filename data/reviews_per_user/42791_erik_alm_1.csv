Requiem for a Dream," This is a fist right between your eyes, and it got R-E-A-L written on the knuckles
","Do you know someone who think drugs are cool?  Let them check this movie out.This is not propaganda against drugs... this is a fist right between your eyes, and it got R-E-A-L written on the knuckles.  There is no preaching, no silly sentence, only raw brutal consequence communicated in one of the most technically brilliant ways I've seen in a long, long time.I've never used drugs, and I hope I never will (hell no after seeing what it did to these people!), but of all movies I've seen depicting the drug-subject this one is the closest to reality.  Not only does it give you a feeling for what shooting up or snorting may actually feel like, it shows you what happens to your life...None of the characters are dumb.  I usually yell at stupid characters, thin reasons or incoherent reactions but this movie had me growling only once. Now afterwards I have to admit, a movie on drugs with no characters with risk behavior would just... turn out to nothing.These are people just like you and me, and just like you and me they are trying to fulfill their dream.  Dreaming is not bad.  But this movie shows us everything depends on what way we choose to pursue that dream, and as we all suspect, the short-cut turns out to be the long way home.I seriously recommend you to see this movie, at least if you are looking for something that will kick your mind and heart into motion.  Yes this movie is a bit like getting waked up by someone throwing a bucket of ice cold water into your face, but hey!  Waking up is a good thing!I give this move a 10 out of 10.",10,1,2,31 July 2003
