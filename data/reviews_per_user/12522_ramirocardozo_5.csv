Vertigo," 'Vertigo' ranks as one of Hitchcock's finest films, a real jewel.
","Perfect is not a word used very often in the analysis of a motion picture, but in the case of 'Vertigo' the adjective seems appropriate. This film is amazing and its place in movie history as one of the best ever made is more than well deserved.This tale about tragic love, obsession, and murder is so well made that the sensation of watching it is almost hypnotic.Hitchcock's direction is flawless. He never fails in holding the viewer attention unfolding the story with unparallel intelligence and impressive skills. He masterfully creates a suspenseful atmosphere with an unsettling dark tone that leaves the viewer exhausted and highly satisfied.Kim Novak is impressive as the leading lady. She's sexy, mysterious, and vulnerable at the same time, giving the best remembered performance of her career.James Stewart as a retired police detective suffering from acrophobia is magnificent. Is hard to describe in words how good he is in this movie. At the beginning of the film he is a kind and practical person aware of his phobia and willing to cure it step by step, but as the story develops he turns into an obsessed man full of pain and guilt who desperately tries to reconstruct his shattered life. The actor makes the psychological transition of his character in such unforced and natural manner that is impossible not to believe him. This is an unforgettable performance.Alfred Hitchcock was the real deal, an outstanding director with unique vision that made extraordinary movies. It is hard to believe that 'The Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences' never gave him an Oscar for his directorial efforts. But awards are a minor thing when you look at his body of work and 'Vertigo' ranks as one his finest films, a real jewel.",Null,7,9,11 October 2004
Dawn of the Dead," A rare example of a remake outdoing its original source.
","If you are looking for an intellectual development of the meaning of life, or for a script full of spirituality that shows the depth of human behavior 'Dawn of the Dead' would be a wrong choice. But if you are the type of moviegoer that appreciates the different genres of movie-making and enjoys a good scare once in a while this movie won't disappoint.The film tells the story of a group of people trying to stay alive and doing their best to avoid great danger. What is the great danger? Well, a very large group of former human beings turned zombies by a deadly virus are after them with the main purpose of eating their flesh. Not a very romantic notion and maybe not a very attractive one if you are thinking about serious cinema, but this is a very well made horror flick that manage to be tense, darkly funny, scary, and well paced. The direction is agile allowing the movie to move with a very nice rhythm keeping the viewer involved for its entire running length. The level of gore is high (I watched the Director's cut) but is a type of blood fest that feels satiric, not sadistic. The acting is good. Sara Polly as a nurse who lost her husband because of the virus and Ving Rhames as a tough but goodhearted police officer are worthy to highlight. The rest of the actors involved also give adequate and credible performances. This movie is a remake of the 1970's horror cult classic of the same name directed by George Romero, and in my opinion is much better film than the original. This remake maintains the B-Movie feel and the creepiness of Romero's film but does it with more technical skills and a more imaginative visual style. The acting is superior to say the less, and the action and suspenseful scenes are better crafted and richer in intensity.In conclusion, this modern 'Dawn of the Dead' is a solid effort in the horror department, and a rare example of a remake outdoing its original source.",Null,0,0,19 November 2004
The Village," A film that holds up for about one hour and then stumbles and falls.
","I won't elaborate much on the plot of 'The Village' due to fact that Director M. Night Shyamalan loves to tell stories where secrets and big revelations are the key to hold the movie together. What I will tell you is that the film doesn't hold together very well.M. Night Shyamalan is without doubts a very talented director with great skills in creating intriguing atmospheres. He knows how to give a special sense of tension to a particular scene. The problem with Shyamalan is that he thinks he's a good writer, and in the case of The Village this is far from the truth.The Village is wonderful to look at. The cinematography is great and there are several moments of hypnotic beauty, but these aspects are not enough to prevent the film from falling down. The way the story is unfolded is awful. The climax of the movie is anticlimactic (big contradiction here). The scares are so sporadic that the tension they generate soon evaporates in scenes of silliness and bad dialog. The acting is uneven. Bryce Dallas Howard starts very strong as Ivy (a brave young blind woman moved by love) but her screen presence looses intensity by the end of the picture. Joaquin Phoenix is adequate without shinning. Sigourney Weaver and Brendan Gleeson are both criminally underused. The two standouts are William Hurt as the Village's leader and Adrien Brody as a mentally challenged young man. These two performances deserve a much better movie.This is a film that holds up for about one hour and then stumbles and falls. Is overlong and at times hopes for the audience to lower its level of intelligence so it can get away with its poorly written plot.",Null,0,0,7 September 2004
In the Name of the Father," an impeccable film that will leave its mark in any sensible viewer
","'In The Name of the Father' is an impeccable film that will leave its mark in any sensible viewer. The film recreates a true historical event that was a sad example of extreme injustice and political double standards.The movie shows, with tons of eloquence, how the powers of government institutions are often used to manipulate the truth. Themes like physical and psychological cruelty, distortion of reality, mind and spiritual growth, human redemption, and family love at its highest level, are treated with brilliance by Jim Sheridan whose wonderful direction allows the viewer to emotionally relate to every aspect of the story.The performances of Pete Postlehwaite and Daniel Day Lewis, as father and son and victims of a terrible misstep of the administration of justice, are astonishing. The scenes between these two actors are incredibly powerful and truly heartbreaking. Emma Thompson also gives a great performance as Gareth Peirce, the lawyer who represented the long awaited arrival of the truth after years of harm and legal blindness.'In The Name of the Father' is a great piece of film-making.",Null,0,1,10 November 2004
Hero," Done with a hard to find spiritual sense of visual beauty.
","Some may argue that Yimou Zhang's 'Hero' is a little bit slow and that its plot is full of symbols that only Chinese viewers are able to fully understand, or that the story is not that interesting and way too ceremonial for its own good , or that it fails to create an emotional involvement between the audience and the characters. All these arguments could be valid depending on the point of view of each viewer, but there's an undeniable aspect about this film that is absolutely worthy to watch: Its unbelievable beauty.'Hero' is an unforgettable experience. The film is meticulously choreographed and the cinematography by Christopher Doyle is just breathtaking. There are scenes so overwhelmingly beautiful that is hard to find words to describe them with justice. Yimou Zhang tells a magical story of ancient China with a hard to find spiritual sense of visual beauty that highly compensates any minor flaw. Splendid.",Null,1,1,4 November 2004
