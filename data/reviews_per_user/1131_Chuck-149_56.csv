Raiders of the Lost Ark," The best adventure movie ever
","This has to be the coolest, most relaxing suspense-action movie ever. Harrison Ford is excellent as Indiana Jones, the school-teacher who acts like an adventurer. The scene where Harrison Ford calmly shoots the man threatening him with a saber 20 feet away ranks way up there in my top 5 all-time sequences. However, I believe that the whole screenplay and actors make this greatly directed movie great.",9,0,0,4 June 1999
Casablanca," Here's looking at you 'Casablanca'.
","This is truly a work of art.  Everything in this movie is perfect, the script, the actors, the filming, and of course, the music.Taking place in an unoccupied little town called  Casablanca during the second world war, the movie is simply gorgeous and meets perfection quite often.  The story is good and original.  It revolves around a nightclub owner called Rick who once had an affair with beautiful Ingrid Bergman and lost her when she found out her husband had not been killed in a concentration camp.When Elsa comes to Casablanca, Rick tries to avoid her as much as possible but who could avoid Ingrid Bergman.  I certainly can't and it seems like Bogart couldn't either.  It isn't any surprise this movie is ranked in everybody's top 15 movies",10,0,0,23 June 1999
Chinatown," THE film-noir of the century.
","Although I do not appreciate Polanski's movies that much ('Macbeth' for example which is the worse movie I've ever seen), I must say that I loved this one.  Sure, it's a little gory, which is what I usually do not like about Polanski's movies, but in 'Chinatown', I thought the gory scenes were OK for two reasons:-There is not too much gore.-The gore scenes are pretty subtle.In fact, I can only recall one gory scene, the ending.  I say it is subtle because I hadn't noticed that Faye Dunaway had been shot through the eye at first.   This movie shows you what you can do with just a few elements. A woman who believes her husband is cheating on her whereas she isn't really his wife, a water dam, and the man who controls the projects for the dam.  These three simple elements lead to a complex story of murder and incest.  Plus, Polanski got the best actors for the movie and created a masterpiece.  It's great.",9,0,1,26 August 1999
Se7en," Good but not as good as 'The silence of the lambs'.
","You're probably thinking that I am a very harsh guy, comparing 'Se7en' to 'The silence of the lambs'.  Well let me tell you why I am comparing them. The theme of the movie is pretty much the same as the one in 'The silence of the lambs'. I also once saw on a box that it was written and I quote 'better than The silence of the lambs'.  Unfortunately, that isn't true. Brad Pitt and Gwyneth Paltrow can't give great performances like Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins gave in 'The silence of the lambs'.  However, Morgan Freeman is a terrific actor and so is Kevin Spacey and so the two of them together can compensate for Pitt's and Paltrow's performance.  The movie starts off in a house.  Someone has been murdered.  The sin this person had committed was gluttony and it seemed he was killed in this way: someone held a gun against his head and forced him to eat spaghetti until he bursted open.  The detective in charge of this case is an experienced detective named William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and is shortly teamed up with a young detective named David Mills (Brad Pitt).  We them have the opening credits and the camera is filming inside the murderer's house.  It is filming his hands which are working on a table and you realize how careful the psycho is.  He cut off the end of his fingers and put bandages around them simply to be sure the police do not find any finger-prints.  The next murder is committed is a person whose sin was greed, then sloth, envy, wrath, pride, and finally lust.  The seven sinners all having been murdered, Mills assumes that the murderer will not strike again and that he has only to catch him.  But that's not what John Doe (Kevin Spacey), the murderer, has in mind.  No, instead of hiding out after his seven murders, he turns himself over to the police and has a last surprise for the two detectives, a surprise that will horrify them and allow the viewer which one is able to know when to hold back and which one should be holding back.  David Fincher does a better job directing this than directing AlienÂ³. However, I thought there was too much unnecessary gore in the movie.  Brad Pitt does a good job with what he is given and Morgan Freeman is as excellent a in any other movie.  But Kevin Spacey walks away with the movie and gives probably the best performance as the crazy John Doe whose way to describe a murder is as scary as seeing him commit one.  It wasn't any surprise he won best villain of the year at the MTV movie awards.  I think he didn't get a nomination for best-supporting actor because he already had one in 'The usual suspects' which he won.  The only disappointing part of the movie is truly Gwyneth Paltrow's performance who seems to be shy in front of the camera.  It's a good movie that got a little too much credit but is still worth watching.",6,1,6,27 January 2000
Fight Club," 'What is Fight club?' It's one of the best movies of the year.r
","There isn't really a way to tell you exactly what 'Fight club' is.  Some might say it's a black-comedy, others might call it a social drama, others, a social comedy.  I'm not sure which of those adjectives describe the movie best but the adjective 'One of the 5 best movies of the year' sure qualifies.  Another one would be 'One of Norton's best performance's ever'. In fact, it's probably his best after the one he gave in 'American history X'.  And yet another way to qualify it would be 'By far David Fincher's best movie yet'.  Yes, 'Fight club' is an excellent movie and true entertainment. Plus, there are great performances by Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, Helena Bonham Carter and Meat Loaf and great direction by David Fincher.The story is narrated by Edward Norton whose name seems to be Jack although he is never called like that by anyone leaving us in doubt.  He explains how he thought his life was a total bore and how he joined certain groups like groups for people with testicular cancer just to make friends. This is where he meets Bob (Meat Loaf) and befriends him.  However, at some point, he sees a woman named Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) in all those groups and guesses she has none of the problems the people attending the reunions have.  However, Jack doesn't either.  So they make a deal so that they do not meet again:  every week, they go to she goes to certain groups while he goes to other groups so they won't see each other.Weeks go by without anything really happening and one day, on a plane, Jack meets a man who calls himself Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt).  Tyler sells soap for a living.  After the plane lands, the two men each go their own way but when Jack gets home, he sees that his apartment has been blown-up and decides to call Tyler to ask him if he might have a free bed at his house. They decide to go to a bar and after three pitchers of beer, they are approaching the bar's closing time and go outside.  This is when, out of the blue, Tyler asks Jack to hit him.  The two men finally end up fighting for real and seem to get some kicks out of it and after a while, they decide to form a fight club whose two principal rules are 'You do not talk about Fight club'.The movie starts off right in the action and never lets the viewer down. Jim Ulhs's screenplay is excellent.  David Fincher also uses a few slow motions to add a certain intensity to the scene.  The music by the Dust brothers is excellent and the other songs used are excellent as well. However, as good as everything about this movie is, nothing beats Edward Norton's performance.  He is simply incredible.  Over here in Canada, the movie got the harshest rating which is '18 and over' and did deserve because although there isn't only violence in this movie, it is very graphic and depicted as it is just when it happens to a person.  Also, the violence shown is especially during the fights and no one dies in these fights. It isn't for the faint-hearted and has a disappointing ending but if you can get to gather all the courage you have to watch this one, you'll see you'll be glad you saw it.",10,3,8,17 January 2000
Citizen Kane," The most over-rated under-rated movie ever made
","This movie is brilliant because it is a simple movie.  You don't need to have read the encyclopedia 50 times or to have learnt the dictionary by heart to understand the story.  That's what is genius in this movie and makes it a true work of art. However, as good as 'Citizen Kane' may be, I believe it is one of the movies that is too unknown to people but is too over-rated by those who do know it.  Don't get me wrong, it's really great.  But to be as good as 'The godfather'.  No way.  I don't think it should get all that credit for having been the first AFI movie.  It shouldn't have been.  But the screenplay and the performances are so great that it does deserve its spot way up there. Maybe not first but easily in the top 10.",8,1,4,2 June 1999
Shakespeare in Love," Way too over-rated.
","When this movie came out, I didn't think much of it.  I thought it was just some romantic comedy trying to do its best at the box-office.  But then it got those thirteen nominations at the Oscars and I started to believe it was pretty good and when I saw Paltrow got a nomination for best actress, I knew she would win.  However, I was surprised it beat Saving private Ryan for best picture.  Recently, I purchased the movie on DVD and was very disappointed by it.  I can't say that, besides Judi Dench who won her Oscar for best supporting actress, it deserved its Oscars for best picture and best actress.  It really didn't and Paltrow wasn't that stunning.  The movie takes place in 1593.  There were two theatres at that time who were in big competition.  One of these was run by a man named Philip Henslowe (Geoffrey Rush in a superb role).  Now at that period in time, women were not allowed to play in plays.  However, Viola De Lessips (Paltrow), the daughter of a rich man, is in love with plays, especially Shakespeare's (Joseph Fiennes) plays.  She is so desperate to act in a play that she finally uses an alias, puts on a mustache, a wig and auditions for the part of Romeo in Shakespeare's new play, Romeo and Ethel which eventually turns out to be Romeo and Juliet.  But Viola has been engaged by her father to another rich man called Lord Wessex (Colin Firth) whom she doesn't love at all.  Naturally, she is in love with Shakespeare and the problems begin.  Joseph Fiennes was over-looked at the Oscars.  I think that instead of giving Paltrow nomination and the Oscar, they should have given the nomination to Fiennes and the best actress Oscar to Cate Blanchett for her role in 'Elizabeth'.  One of the reasons Paltrow won is probably because she is naked quite often in the movie.  Of course this is a good movie, but it was definitely not the best picture of the year.  Proof is, it isn't the best 1998 movie on our top 250 films list.  Judi Dench's and Geoffrey Rush's performances are, however, exceptional.  So, once again, this is not a terrible movie but it is not the best movie of 1998 either.",7,2,4,12 January 2000
The Hustler," The performances are what make this movie great.
","Except for 'Cat on a hot tin roof', Paul Newman didn't get any big roles until 'The hustler'.  But after he played the role of Eddie Felson, which got him a nomination, he became one of the most highly acclaimed actors in Hollywood.  So I guess you could say that to Paul Newman, 'The hustler' represents the same thing 'The graduate' represents to Dustin Hoffman.  It was his break-through movie and he was really good in it.  'The hustler' is also probably the best movie that director Robert Rossen has ever directed. He threw in together the ingredients of a film-noir and of a drama, mixed them together and created a classic.One night, Eddie Felson (Newman) decides to go to a pool-room one night to play the local champ, Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason).  He starts off pretty well and that frustrates Fats for he has never lost.  But as the hours pass by, Eddie starts drinking and becomes totally drunk and so Fats starts winning again until Felson is completely broke and must be carried out of the pool-room.Back in his town again, Eddie meets a woman called Sarah Packard (Piper Laurie) at the train station and falls in love with her.  She invites him over to her place and soon after, he moves in with her.  And so Eddie begins to settle down.  Then, one day he meets a man named Bert Gordon (George C. Scott) who tells Eddie that he will help him beat Minnesota Fats but in exchange, he wants 75% of everything Eddie makes hustling.  Eddie tries to negotiate with Bert about the size of the slice he is asking for but Bert is unflexable.  P***ed off, Eddie leaves the bar where he spoke with Bert telling him he doesn't need his help.Eddie goes to another bar and hustles a pool-player until the guy is flat broke.  But the guys in the bar despise hustlers and once Eddie has won and collected his money, the boys take him outside and break his thumbs so he won't be able to play pool again for a while.  When he gets back home, Sarah puts some bandages on his thumbs and he slowly begins healing.  It is then that he notices that his girlfriend has a serious drinking problem and that something has to be done.The rest of the movie is the best part of the whole thing.  Paul Newman, Jackie Gleason, Piper Laurie, and George C. Scott lead a terrific cast. Plus, Robert Rossen's choice of filming the movie in black and white made the movie all the more riveting and gripping.  But it's Jackie Gleason and George C. Scott who steal the show, one playing one of the best pool players ever, the other playing a greedy man who has Eddie beat Fats only for the money.  A true classic.",8,3,7,19 September 1999
L.A. Confidential," One of the best in the genre.
","Most film-noir movies are pretty good.  Personally, I think the best is 'Chinatown' followed closely by 'The Maltese falcon'.  However, there haven't been that many recent film-noir movies that rank way up there in the best film-noirs of all-time.  But L.A. Confidential is different, so allow me to present to you my third favorite film-noir.  Masterfully directed by Curtis Hanson, it IS, in my opinion, the best movie of 1997.  Kim Basinger's performance was definitely of Oscar-winning quality and I'm glad she won best supporting actress.    The story basically revolves around this: Three cops, their captain, their precinct, a big-shot criminal in prison, a murder in a diner, a rich man, prostitutes, and a writer.  Kevin Spacey plays Jack Vincennes, a hot-shot policeman known especially for being the technical advisor of Brett Chase, the actor playing the main cop in the fictional TV show 'Badge of honor'. Russell Crowe plays Bud White, the physically strong officer who is especially impartial to women beaters.  And finally, the third hero, Ed Exley played by Guy Pearce, who is the smartest, most honest (if not too honest) cop around.  These three cops represent the three main aspects of their police precinct: Brains, courage, and honor.  A gruesome murder is committed in a small diner.  Ed Exley takes the case. The only problem is that he is despised by most men in the precinct.  Bud White wants a piece of the case because his ex-partner was killed at the diner and Jack Vincennes just wants to keep out of it so he can make money working for Cid Hutchons (Danny DeVito) busting criminals, working narcotics.  However, we soon realize that the murder connects all three characters together and involves much more including a beautiful call-girl named Lynn (Kim Basinger).  There aren't any flaws in this movie and Curtis Hanson picks up the 'Chinatown' aspect extremely well making this, in a way, the 'Chinatown' of the 90's because it's just so good.  As usual, Spacey delivers a tour-de-force performance which includes action and laughs.  Danny DeVito is excellent as well. David Starthairn is terrific as Pierce Patchet, the millionaire who seems to have something to do with everything that goes around in L.A.  James Cromwell is equally good as the wise police captain. See it.",8,0,1,12 September 1999
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," The ultimate western comedy.
","My favorite cowboy movie goes by the name of 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid'.  This film has everything that you want to read into it. Some of the funniest scenes of cinema that I've ever seen are in this movie as well as some of the best action scenes.All you've got to do to be part of 'The hole in the wall gang' is have a gun, know how to use it, and like Butch and Sundance. There isn't much to say about this film without spoiling the surprise for you so let me put it this way:  just go see it.",9,0,3,23 June 1999
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," The unbeatable black-comedy on the cold war.
","What a movie this is.  This movie is a true group-work because the actors make the screenplay twice as perfect as it really is but Kubrick's editing, filming and writing helps the cast be perfect. Peter Sellers is terrific in his three roles but is by far the best as Dr. Strangelove.  George C. Scott is also excellent as the totally anti-communist American general trying to find a solution to question wether the bomb must be dropped or not. This is a hilarious movie and a work of art by a true genius who calls himself Stanley Kubrick.  By far his best movie from my point of view, 'Dr. Strangelove' is excellent and nearly irreproachable (don't forget the scene when Slim Pickens rides the bomb all the way down).",10,1,1,1 June 1999
Taxi Driver," The best movie to show the effects of the Vietnam war after it.
","What a movie.  De Niro's performance is excellent and one of his best career performances, Scorsese's directing is great as well and last but not least, Bernard Hermann's music is perfect and could not have been chosen better.  De Niro is Travis Bickle, a Vietnam vet who can't sleep at night so decides to become a taxi driver at night.  You then see all the horrors he has to live each night by seeing a few of the people he has to pick-up especially the man played by Scorsese. He plays a disturbed man who wants to kill his wife because she has left him for a black man. 
  Bickle falls in love with a political worker, Betsy (Cybill Shepherd), but their affair does not work out after Travis unwillingly makes a stupid mistake (I won't reveal to you what the mistake was, you'll have to see the movie to find out for yourselves).  We then realize he has been very affected by the Vietnam war as he somewhat becomes paranoid.  He then tries to save a twelve year-old prostitute from the world in which she lives and his attempt leads to a violent ending.  'Taxi driver' is a great movie and of the most powerful one in years.  The music, however, is probably as good as the performances and the directing. This is one you must see.",9,0,0,31 August 1999
Forrest Gump," The biggest thief I've ever seen.
","I know my one line summary might not be that clear so I'm going to explain it to you.  In  1994, we had classics like 'The Shawshank redemption' and 'Pulp fiction' who were in nomination at the Oscars and were stolen in every category in which they were nominated.  They were all stolen by 'Forrest Gump'.  These two other movies which were completely different in their style from the movies of the same genre as them but who came before them were completely over-looked.  And the worst part is 'Forrest Gump' is simply the biography of Forest Gump.  Also, it robbed every movie in the best actor category.  Of course it isn't that easy to play someone who is mentally ill but it's easier than playing just some ordinary person and playing it well.  Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) lives with his mother and comes from North-West Alabama.  However, he has a slight mental deficiency and a leg problem for which he must wear a brace.  When he starts going to school, he is rejected by everyone except the bus-driver and a young girl named Jenny.  One day after school, while Forrest and jenny are hanging together, they are surprised by a bunch of boys from their school who start throwing rocks at Forrest.  He tries to run away but because of his bad leg, he can hardly get away.  This is the classic scene when Jenny yells 'Run Forrest, run.' and as he runs, his brace starts to come off and the boys who were chasing him are unable to catch up to him for he is too fast, even though they have bikes.  As the years pass, Forrest and Jenny (Robin Wright Penn) go their own way. Forrest gets into the army and goes to Vietnam.  But one night in the camp, all the soldiers are in bed and pass on a Playboy magazine.  When Forrest gets it, he realizes Jenny has her photograph in it.  Further on during the war, he saves the life of his lieutenant named Don Taylor (Gary Sinise) but loses his best friend Bubba.  Also, his lieutenant is left legless because of the accident whereas the only Forrest gets is a bullet in the butt.  When Forrest gets home, he as many things to do.  On of them is to go over to Bubba's parents' house to announce to them he was killed in combat.  Another thing he does is try to find Jenny.  The movie is a kind of comedy-drama and is pretty good.  But I still don't think nor understand how it won best picture, best actor (Tom Hanks) and best director (Robert Zemeckis) at the Oscars. I mean, if it had really deserved those Oscars, wouldn't it get a higher rank than both 'Pulp fiction' and 'The Shawshank redemption' on our top 250 list?  I actually believe that the one who deserved an Oscar more than anyone else in the movie is Gary Sinise as Lieutenant Don Taylor.  However, it was almost impossible for him to win that year because we had Martin Landau in nomination for best supporting actor in 'Ed Wood' and he truly deserved the Oscar he won.  So all in all, this isn't a bad movie, it's just way too over-rated.",6,1,4,18 January 2000
The Godfather: Part II," The best sequel in cinema history.
","To all you movie-buffs who have seen 'The godfather' and really loved it but haven't seen 'The godfather part II' yet, you've got to see it.  It's absolutely incredible.    Once again masterfully directed by Francis Ford Coppola, it lives up to both its reputation and its predecessor.  One of the best parts of this movie is how you see two people changing in parallel:<ul><li>Michael Corleone (Pacino) who becomes a criminal after having sworn to his wife that the family would be legitimate.</li></ul><ul><li>His father Vito (De Niro in his Oscar- winning supporting actor performance) who goes from good to evil.</li></ul>  The movie follows the steps of its predecessor with many classic scenes (the ending especially).  Pacino, De Niro, Starsberg, Duvall, Keaton, and Shire give tremendous performances.  See it.",10,3,3,16 August 1999
Fargo," A terrible 'film-noir' movie with no plot, no action and way too much gore.
","I can't recall having seen a much worse movie than this one. Thank god for the Coen brothers they were able to get a great actress like Frances McDormand to play in it or this would've been, in my opinion, a disgrace to Hollywood and the movie industry.  The story is ridiculous and doesn't lead to anything besides an extremely gory ending.",3,5,15,1 June 1999
American Pie," The best pie ever made.
","I know what most adults are thinking when somebody talks to them about 'American pie'.  They believe it's some stupid comedy only about young kids who want to have sex before graduating.  Well, that's not what it is about. Indeed, there is much more to the movie than just four kids wanting to have sex.  There is a story of relationships between friends as well as a big sports theme (lacrosse particularly).  This is not only crude humor, it isn't slap-stick all the time.  It has some very intelligent moments.  The movie begins with a strong beginning.  Jim (Jason Biggs) is jacking off in his room as he is watching an illegal channel when suddenly, without any warning, his mother comes in.  This scene gives you a pretty good impression of just how much you will probably laughing through the movie. We then move on to Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) who already has a girlfriend, Vickie (Tara Reid), but have been at the same level of their relationship for quite some time now.  There is also Chris (Chris Klein) who is a Lacrosse player and is too insensitive to maintain any relationship with a girl.  And finally, there is Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) who is the fourth friend and doesn't try to hook up with girls that much.  But when the four guys make a pact to get laid before they graduate, they all become enthusiastic.
  First time-directors Chris and Paul Weitz do a great job with 'American pie'.  They seem to remember pretty well what their high-school graduation must have been like because the prom scene seems to be recreated in the exact same way it was for them.  They also seemed to know exactly when to cut the comic scenes perfectly so that they don't put too much and turn their jokes into stupid jokes.  Also to be mentioned as supporting actors are Sean W. Scott as Stifler, Natasha Lyonne as Jessica and Eugene Levy as Jim's dad.  It's a great movie with great humor and I highly recommend it.",10,1,2,9 January 2000
The Color of Money," Newman at his unequaled best.
","I've got five names for you: Dexter Gordon, William Hurt, Bob Hoskins, James Woods, and Paul Newman.  Now you're probably thinking 'What is this guy getting at?' or 'Who cares about these names?'.  That's because you DON'T know what I'm getting at.  These are the five actors who were in nomination for best actor in 1986 and the winner was Newman for 'The color of money'.  And he didn't just win because this was about his eighth nomination and he hadn't won yet so the voters decided he should win and voted for him.  No, he won because he was the best that year. 
  In 1961, Eddie Felson (Paul Newman) was trying to become the best pool-player around by beating Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason).  25 years later, he owns a small bar.  But one day, he hears some noises at the pool tables that only he knows because of his experience as a hustler.  When he turns, there he sees a kid who's about in his 20's and who has, as Felson says, 'a sledge-hammer break'.  He goes over to talk to him but since he's busy playing, he introduces himself to the kid's girlfriend, Carmen (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio).  He tries to see if the kid is a hustler by trying to hustle Carmen but at every offer he makes, she tells him he should talk to her boyfriend Vincent (Tom Cruise).   Felson buys them a drink and then takes them to dinner.  At the restaurant, Eddie tells them that after having seen Vincent play, he thinks he could beat anyone and also, Eddie pulls a little magic trick on Vincent and his girlfriend.  The next day, Eddie goes to visit Vincent at work and he makes him a proposition in which he will take Vincent and Carmen on a trip to teach Vincent how to make big money hustling and then, take them to Atlantic City where he could compete in the annual pool championship and would probably win.  After the proposition, Vincent asks for a few days to talk it over with his girlfriend, but they eventually agree.  Once they leave on the trip, the movie reaches its peak and Newman gives the performance of his career as he tries to teach Vincent the right way to hustle.  Scorsese's directing is indeed excellent.  The music and script are excellent as well and the supporting cast is excellent as well.  But Newman simply dominates the movie from start to finish.  He is twice as good as he was in 'The hustler' and didn't only teach Vincent how to win as a hustler when he was playing Eddie Felson in the movie, but he probably taught Cruise a thing or two about acting since Cruise's childhood movie-star was Paul Newman.  The two of them make a great pair.  But Paul Newman is still one of the best and shows it to everybody in this movie.  You've got to see it.",9,1,2,19 September 1999
Apocalypse Now," I love the smell of 'Apocalypse now' in the morning.
","This movie has got to be one of the best Vietnam war movies of all-time. It is definitely my favorite.  Although the movie doesn't exactly revolve around the war itself, the story around which it does revolve does show the horrors of the Vietnam war.The beginning is excellent with Martin Sheen waiting in his room.  He's waiting for a mission and he gets one.  One that'll probably make him lose the taste of having to go on a mission ever again.  He's assigned to take down a crazy American colonel who is called Colonel Kurtz.  He lives on an island isolated from any war activity or any possible American invasion. We do not know whether the other people on the island are being held captive or if they are there by their own will.On his way to the island, Martin Sheen runs into another  radical colonel played by the always perfect Robert Duvall.  It is during the unfortunately too short scenes with Duvall that we see what the war kind of looked like. A bunch of Vietnamese people living in straw houses and fields being bombed by the Americans.  It is during one of the American Napalm-bombing scene that Robert Duvall says 'I love the smell of Napalm in the morning'.The killing of Colonel Kurtz (beautifully played by Marlon Brando) by Martin Sheen is purely genius for we have the killing scene of Kurtz and the killing scene od a cow by Kurtz's men outside that are in parallel.The movie is beautifully well directed by Francis Ford Coppola (The godfather) and greatly acted by Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, and Robert Duvall.  I extremely recommended to anybody.",9,0,0,15 June 1999
American History X," One of the most powerful movies in years.
","Powerful, moving, and at some times touching, 'American history X' is all that.  Plus, it has a great script, great directing, and above all, great acting especially by Edward Norton in the lead role as the neo-Nazi. 
  After having shot and killed two black people as they were trying to break into his car, Derek Vinyard (Norton) is sent up the river for three years, a journey he will never forget.  When he is released, Derek seems to have changed a whole lot while he was in prison and as soon as he gets home, he tells his young brother (Edward Furlong) who looks up to him as if he were looking up to God, that he doesn't want him to get involved in the Nazi community as he did.  He also tells his kid brother not to attend a Nazi party that is held the same night Derek just got out.  Not listening to his big brother, Danny attends the party and is caught red-handed by Derek. 
  It is at the party that we see just how much Derek has changed.  He even goes so far as to asking his girlfriend to follow him by leaving the Nazi party and its community for ever. After she refuses, Derek finds his brother Danny at the party and escapes with him.  After the escape, Derek tells Danny what happened to him in jail and makes him understand why he changed and why Danny should as well.  The movie doesn't have any flaws and is powerful all along.  However, it is Norton who brings this movie to stardom with his compelling performance as Derek Vinyard.  Don't miss it.",10,0,0,26 August 1999
The Usual Suspects," Perfect, the best thriller ever made.
","I loved this movie when I first saw it and still love it as much as the first time I saw it.  This is an excellent example to describe a work-of-art.  Bryan Singer took six good actors and by creating a certain relation between all of them created a masterpiece of American cinema. Byrne, Baldwin, and Pollak are especially good as the main criminals but Spacey is the one who carries this movie to stardom as he brilliantly embodies Verbal Kint.The action scenes are excellent and the police line-up at the beginning movie is very very good.  Although this movie is primarily a thriller-action movie, Singer managed to squeeze in some scenes of humor (the line-up has its very funny moments).  'The usual suspects' grab your attention directly at the beginning of their crimes and won't let you go until they know that Keyser Sose is dead or off their track.  However Sose has his own plans about their destiny and is ready to make them work at all costs just like you should see it at all costs.",10,0,1,9 July 1999
Gone with the Wind," Good but way too over-rated
","This is the greatest movie of all-time according to many people.  But according to me, it's good but way too over-rated. Gable is incredible, Leigh is breathtaking, and McDaniel is excellent.  That's what I truly saw in this movie.  But are three excellent performances enough to make a movie that good?  They shouldn't.When I saw AFI's top 100 all-time classics, I thought that it would be second after Casablanca or even maybe vice-versa but when I saw that 'The godfather' was third before 'Gone with the wind', I thought 'Maybe it's a little over-rated' and when I did see it, I thought 'This is over-rated'. Now don't get me wrong, it's a must-see for any movie goer but it definitely doesn't deserve a spot in the top 40.",8,1,2,6 July 1999
Saving Private Ryan," Good but nothing like 'Schindler's list'.
","When I got to the theater to see this 'Saving private Ryan', I hadn't yet seen 'Schindler's list' and thought it was pretty good and that it would win a lot of awards at the Oscars.  However, after having seen 'Schindler's list', I understand why 'Saving private Ryan' did not win best picture of the year.'Saving private Ryan' is closer than a cool action movie than a heavy drama like 'Schindler's list'.  Sure it's good, but it isn't the best movie of the year.  I think that perhaps if Spielberg had cut out more of the action and gory scenes and had concentrated more on the fact that Mrs. Ryan would like to see her last son come home, it probably would have been a higher and better quality drama than it actually is.Although the opening on the beach of Normandie on D-day is pretty well shown, I think that there were a couple of scenes that could have been cut for example one of the soldiers looking around for his arm in a pile of others or the other soldier trying to keep all his intestines inside his body.All in all, it's a very good movie but it isn't even close to being nearly as good as 'Schindler's list' (which probably explains why 'Saving private Ryan didn't win best picture of the year).",7,0,0,6 July 1999
Lawrence of Arabia," Lawrence changes personality a little too radically
","I enjoyed this movie but not as much as others.  I think the first problem with it is that Lean spent too much time showing us Lawrence's character.  What I mean is that instead of showing only the non-violent side of Lawrence he also shows us his nice and polite English man side which didn't have such a major role in the picture.  Personally, I thought Anthony Quinn and Jack Hawkins were really the ones who controlled the movie and gave that nice smooth flow.  The fighting scenes in the desert are excellent and so is the acting, directing, filming, and story.I have to say that this is an excellent movie and the reason I it enjoyed a little less than others is probably all a matter of taste.  However, I have to recommend this movie-classic to any movie lover.",7,2,6,6 July 1999
Schindler's List," By far Spielberg's best movie.
","'Schindler's list' ranks in two categories of films: The best movies in cinema history as well as in that category of movies whose subject is what people want to see transfered to the screen.  What I mean by that is this: The story of 'Schindler's list' is how a Nazi works against the rest of the Nazis by making sure that all the Jewish people he can find will not be killed in concentration camps but work in his factory instead.  In other words, it's an anti-war and anti-Nazi movie.  And it's great.  Liam Neeson is excellent as Oskar Schindler, the one Nazi who doesn't want to see the Jewish people persecuted during WWII.  Ben Kingsley is very good as well as Iztak Stern, the Jewish man who Schindler employs to run the factory.  However, Ralph Fiennes performance is absolutely masterful.  His role is a crazy Nazi officer in charge of a concentration camp and he does a great job at it.  In fact, I believe he should have won best supporting-actor in 'Schindler's list'.  Moving, touching, and incredibly realistic, this based on a true story movie is a true gem and honor for cinema history and it's quite understandable that it is found among practically every movie-buff's top ten list.  It also has the great advantage of having been directed by another one of the masters, Steven Spielberg.  You've got to see it.",10,9,13,8 September 1999
Amadeus," One of the best movies ever made by a genius, Milos Forman.
","If you look back at Forman's passed movies, you think essentially of one of them, that movie being the all-time classic 'One flew over the cuckoo's nest'.  But you can't overlook his second masterpiece, 'Amadeus'.  Although not quite as excellent as his previous classic, Forman's tale of jealousy and tragedy plays out as well as it could have.  Plus, a terrific performance by F. Murray Abraham and a terrific script kept the movie as good as it could be for its complete running-time.  The movie's opening scene consists in the camera filming two servants running over to their master's room whom we hear yelling.  After they break into the room they realize that their master, Antonio Salieri (Abraham), has tried to commit suicide for his neck is slit.  However, he is saved just on time and taken to a hospital where a priest comes to see him offering him forgiveness.  However, Salieri uses the priest as a witness to his tale of the murder of Amadeus (Tom Hulce).  The movie shows all the facts that made Salieri hate Amadeus all the more as well as the trouble Amadeus could get into and his difficulty to make end's meet also.  You finally see how Amadeus dies, according to Forman naturally, and why Salieri blames himself for the murder of the composer.  Between the directing, the acting, the script, and the costumes, there isn't much Forman doesn't include.  Of course, the music is better than in probably any other movie.  But I think that what impressed me the most about this movie is Abraham's truely beautiful, convincing performance.  It's a shame he hasn't played in any other great movies since because he is a tremendous actor.  But the bottom line for this movie is this: See it.",10,2,4,10 September 1999
Patton," The only movie showing the rivalry between English and Americans and it's perfect.
","This is a terrific WWII movie.  It's the kind of movie that grabs you from beginning to end.  Patton's opening speech is breathtaking (so is the movie). The movie spins around general George S. Patton and his rivalry with English general Montgomery to stop Rhomel's troups first and earn himself a third star. However, Patton is very short-tempered (perhaps too sometimes) and must suffer some consequences for this bad temper. The fighting scenes in the desert are excellent but I believe that some of the most interesting scenes are when you see either the Germans or Montgomery trying to figure out what will be Patton's next move. 'Patton' is a clever, tough and uncompromising movie about the 2nd world war and must be seen at all costs.",9,2,4,1 June 1999
Annie Hall," One of Woody Allen's best
","I've only seen two Woody Allen movies up to now and I can already state that he is one of my favorite directors.  The other movie I saw from him is 'Everyone says I love you' which I thought was a very good movie with lots of laughs.  However, then I saw 'Annie Hall' and I realized just how good a director he really was.  He won an Oscar for best director in this movie and really deserved it.  Diane Keaton also won an Oscar as best actress in the movie which she also deserved.  The movie is funny entertaining and doesn't drag.  Actually it would be pretty for the movie if it dragged because it only lasts an hour and a half.  The story starts off with Woody Allen telling two jokes back to back. Then, he suddenly becomes a man named Alvy Singer and starts telling us the story of his relationship with a woman named Annie Hall (Diane Keaton). Along the flashbacks, we see what kind of relationships he had with other women.  And all along these adventures, he manages to squeeze in a ton of laughs.  He finally gets to how his relationship with Annie Hall began.  One day, after a tennis match with his friends where Annie was playing, he met her after the game.  They talked a little and then Alvy asked her if she could give him a lift.  On the way back, Alvy probably lost the taste of wanting to be in the car that Annie is driving. Some of you could consider this to be typical Woody Allen stuff, but even if you're right, it's great stuff.  What's also great about the Woody Allen movies is that in a scene in which he is playing but somebody else in speaking, it's always important to look at his face to get a funny figure or a grimace on his face.  The best part of his jokes is how he is able to tell them without even smiling.  Finally, throughout the whole movie, we see the love he has for New-York city.  If it hadn't been for the script-writer, he would have spent the whole movie in New-York.  It's a terrific movie.",8,1,2,21 January 2000
The Graduate," Good job Mrs. Robinson!
","When people think of the movie that gave the boost to Dustin Hoffman's career, they think of 'The graduate' which is totally correct in my opinion. However, even though he got a nomination for his role as Ben Braddock, and considering the fact that he is my favorite actor, I must admit that I believe he did such a good job in the movie because he was acting with one of the best actresses of all-time, Anne Bancroft.  I believe that the team they made is really what makes this movie an American classic.  Ben Braddock (Hoffman) has just graduated and so his parents decide to host a grand party in his honor and attending the party is Mrs. Robinson (Bancroft).  She manages to get Braddock to take her home and even gets him trapped in her daughter's bedroom as she stands totally naked in front of him.  Completely out of control, Braddock tries to break out of the room but Mrs. Robinson keeps him inside explaining to him that if he ever wants her services, all he has to do is call her.    The next week, Braddock calls Mrs. Robinson and asks her to spend a night with him at a motel.  She agrees under the one condition which is that he must never take her daughter out on a date.  However, when Mrs. Robinson's daughter (Katharine Ross) returns home from college, Ben's father tells his son he should take her out on a date just out of courtesy and this is when everything starts screwing up.  Fine performances by Bancroft, Hoffman, and Ross, great directing by Nichols, and excellent music by 'Simon and Garfunkel' are what make this one superb.  The only flaw the movie has is a rather simple dialogue but the originality of the script is so good that it helps back-up the movie's only weak spot.  Highly recommended.",9,1,2,10 September 1999
A Clockwork Orange," The creepiest, most violent black-comedy ever.
","Stanley Kubrick is without a doubt one of the best directors of all-time. His classic movies span from 1957 with 'Paths of glory' up until today and his movies are still greatly appreciated.  Among his classics are 'Paths of glory', '2001: a space odyssey', 'Full metal jacket', and my personal favorite, 'Dr. Strangelove'.  In all of these movies, you can see the desire that Kubrick has to depict violence as it really is.  Well in 'A clockwork orange', he depicted it better than any director did in any other movie.  In this true classic, you can see what Kubrick was all about: Showing events as violent as they really are.  The story revolves around a teenage boy named Alex (Malcolm McDowell) and his three 'droogs' whose night-time pleasures are murder and rape.  The movie begins with the four 'droogs' drinking a drugged milk in some kind of a bar for milk.  They then leave the bar and just for the fun of it, decide to kill an old beggar.  They then rob a car, pull up to someone's house, and after having been able to enter, they rape and kill the woman and cripple her husband.  After a second attempt at rape and murder, Alex's friends backstab him and turn him over to the cops.  It is then that he is sent to prison where he will volunteer for a special treatment which consists in taking out all the taste of violence out of a person.  After having successfully passed the treatment, he is set free.  But when he gets back into the world, everything has changed and Alex suddenly begins having great problems.  Ultraviolent and a little sick, this futuristic black-comedy is probably the first movie people think of when they think of Kubrick.  It may not be for all tastes, but it's still a classic and any movie-buff should imperatively watch it.",9,0,0,9 September 1999
Some Like It Hot," It was pretty hot.
","What else could you expect from director Billy Wilder but a masterpiece when he's given such s terrific cast and good script like he had for 'Some like it hot'.  I mean, if you've seen 'Sunset boulevard', 'Stalag 17' and 'Witness for the prosecution', it's impossible to think that 'Some like it hot' might be kind of boring and anyway, if you think it's going to be boring, you're wrong.  Also, you might not have noticed, but most comedies (except for Woody Allen's 'Annie Hall' and a few others of his) rarely hit the big-time or become timeless classics.  However, it was nice to see that AFI recognized 'Some like it hot' as being a terrific comedy and they ranked it 14th on their 100 greatest American films.  Two good friends, Jerry (Jack Lemmon) and Joe (Tony Curtis), witness a murder by one of the biggest gangsters but manage to escape but instead of running to the police, they decide to hide from the gangsters by dressing up as two women who play in a band (I forgot to mention that their job is to play in a band). It's on the trip with that band that they meet Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe) and they naturally both fall in love with her.  The rest of the movie is pure comedy and I don't want to spoil the fun for anybody so I guess you'll just have to see it.  The movie also has some great scenes like the one where Curtis imitates Cary Grant.  It's worth at least two good watches if not three.",10,6,9,3 September 1999
Pulp Fiction," Clever, tough, funny, brilliant. A gem.
","This is a great movie.  Quentin Tarantino who decided to break down his movie into four little stories did a great job at it.  Plus, he added everything in it that was necessary without overdoing anything.  Sure some of the scenes are rough but there isn't a scene in the movie where you can say 'Well that's a little too much' unless you hate violence.  But what is great about this movie as well is that Tarantino somewhat copied Hitchcock (Be forewarned, I'm giving away some scenes in the movie so if you haven't seen it, skip this part, read the last paragraph and read this after you've seen it.  However, if you don't mind having a few scenes spoiled before seeing the movie, go ahead, be my guest and read this).<ul><li>When Travolta stabs Uma Thurman with the needle, Tarantino did like Hitchcock used to do: He makes you think it's going to be very gory and sick but there isn't a drop of blood.</li></ul><ul><li>When Ving Rhames crosses the street, stares at Bruce Willis, curses at him and then gets run over by Bruce Willis, Tarantino copied a little the scene in 'Psycho' when Janet Leigh's boss crosses the street and sees her in her car when he thinks she's home resting.</li></ul>  So, this said, the movie is really great.  Personally, I felt that Travolta should have won the Oscar for best actor that year instead of Tom Hanks in 'Forrest Gump'.  It's an excellent crime movie.",9,0,0,16 August 1999
The Untouchables," The best movie on Al Capone.
","Before 'The untouchables', Kevin Costner wasn't as big a star as he is today.  So you could consider 'The untouchables' to be the movie that made a movie star of him.  Nowadays, everybody knows him.  We all know that he has delivered some very good performances and some terrible ones.  But his best performance is without a doubt his performance in this movie.  He seemed to know the feelings of his character very well and was great in the role of Eliot Ness, the cop who finally gets Capone convicted.  Also, we have Sean Connery who plays Malone, the man who helps Ness put Capone in prison and I think he steals the show in his Oscar-winning performance as best-supporting actor.  The movie begins with Al Capone (Robert De Niro) getting interviewed while his personal barber shaves him.  The second scene is what sets off the movie: Capone's men, who are incapable of convincing a bartender into selling alcohol that Capone imported into Chicago (we are in the 30's and there is prohibition in Chicago).  The bartender refuses and in revenge, the men leave a suitcase with a bomb in it.  But there is a little girl in the pub who only went there to get her daily milk and as the men walk out, she follows them trying to give them back their suitcase.  But the suitcase explodes in her hands killing her on the spot.  And then the story kicks off.  Ness (Costner) tries to bust Capone but doesn't know how and doesn't really have the guts to go all the way.  But when he meets Malone (Connery), he is taught a lesson of courage as well as how to beat Capone and the Mob. But how can a few strong and courageous cops stop the impossible from happening.  So naturally, the Mob fights back and  causes some serious damage in the cops' camp.  Brian De Palma used some 'extreme violence' to show the power of both the Mob and the cops in this incredibly powerful drama based on the true life of detective Eliot Ness who finally got Capone behind bars.  De Palma also masterfully directed the movie and made good choices for his cast which consists of Costner, Connery, De Niro, and Andy Garcia.  The script is excellent as well.  But as I stated before, I believe that it Sean Connery that makes this movie so great with his excellent performance as Malone.  I think that it is his best performance in his whole career.  So see this movie.  It's great classic about the Mob vs. cops where for once, the Mob appears as the bad-guy.  It's worth seeing at any cost.",9,1,1,17 September 1999
It's a Wonderful Life," Beautiful charmer, pure and simple.
","'It's a wonderful life' is one of those movies that is so good that it has the same effect on you even if you watch a million times.  The story is brilliant and at the same time it is somewhat simple, James Stewart's performance is probably his best, and Capra's directing is excellent as well.  Beginning with God talking to one of his angels telling him that George Bailey (Stewart) wants to kill himself, the movie never drags.  You then see Bailey's life and how he married Mary Hatch (Donna Reed) and why he now wants to kill himself.  But when George's archangel is sent on Earth and meets with Bailey, the movie is at its best.  Keeping it simple all along, Capra made his best movie ever when he did 'It's a wonderful life'.  It must not be missed.",10,1,4,31 August 1999
Die Hard," If you haven't seen it, 'Welcome to the party pal'!!
","An NYPD in L.A. separated from his wife who works there.  A mastermind criminal who wants to take the building in which she works hostage.  That's all you need to know before watching 'Die hard'.  It IS the action movie of the century.  Bruce Willis and Alan Rickman lead the cast in this non-stop action movie and they're terrific.  But that's not all.  The directing is excellent and the script, well it's pretty much perfect.  'Die hard' has all the elements  a movie needs to be great:  It's relaxing, it's got tons of action, plenty of laughs and one-liners, and overall, Hollywood's best action-hero ever, Bruce Willis.  That's all there is to it.  Now go see it and if that doesn't keep you awake for the whole running time, you should definitely see a doctor.  The other thing that's great about 'Die hard' is that if someone invites you to their party and asks you to bring a movie and you don't know which one to bring, bring 'Die hard' because everybody is going to enjoy it. Enough said.  Now go rent it.",10,0,1,26 August 1999
Psycho," Well, a Hitchcock's fan's best friend is his 'Psycho'.
","This is what great thrillers are all about.  It's rather hard to tell a lot about this masterpiece without spoiling some of the surprises contained in it but I'll try my best to spoil as little as possible.  This is definitely Hitchcock's best picture and it's really great.  For this movie, Hitchcock took many actors that were rather unknowns and made them movie stars by having perfectly directed them.  Plus, the idea and the script are exceptional and don't have any flaws.  And if that's not enough for you, just think of all the people that are afraid to take showers when they are all alone in their houses because of the traumatizing shower in the movie.  Anthony Perkins is brilliant as the hermit called Norman Bates who lives alone with his 'mother'.    It's pure genius and keeps you guessing until the end.  Martin Balsam and Janet Leigh are excellent as well in their supporting roles.  A sequel was made but I recommend only the first one (Hitchcock didn't direct the second one anyway).  You must see it.",10,5,9,16 August 1999
To Kill a Mockingbird," Powerful, moving, a masterpiece.
","This is one of the great all-time movies.  It is incredibly moving for you see the total negligence of a black man's innocence in South America and yet, you have Gregory Peck trying to educate his children, especially his daughter (brilliantly played by Mary Badham), against racial discrimination. This is one of the most under-rated movies ever with one of the greatest under-rated actors, Gregory Peck, and it's wrong to under-rate him; he's a very very very good actor.The movie is filled with power, sadness, and an excellent look at racism in South America.  I would say the ending with Robert Duvall standing behind the door and then Mary Baham takes his hand and goes outside with him on the swing is one of the prettiest, saddest, most powerful scenes of all-time. An absolute must-see.",9,0,1,18 June 1999
The Bridge on the River Kwai," David Lean's best movie and Guinness's too.
","I don't know why, but every time I ask somebody what their favorite David Lean movie is, I always get the same answer, 'Lawrence of Arabia'.  Well mine is 'The bridge on the river Kwai'.  I think that the roles in this movie were much harder to play than in 'Lawrence of Arabia'.  Another thing I don't understand is that when most people I know refer to 'The bridge on the river Kwai', they only talk about the script and naturally, Lean's directing and Guinness's performance.  I think that it is William Holden who steals the show and he didn't even get a nomination in it.  His performance as Shears is absolutely incredible and totally convincing.  The movie begins with an English platoon giving in to a Japanese prison camp in WWII on a Japanese island.  When they arrive to the camp, their leader, Colonel Nicholson (Guinness) asks to see the chief of the camp.  He is presented to Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) and announces to him that his platoon is surrendering.  Colonel Saito tells Colonel Nicholson that his men will have to work hard to build a bridge that goes from one side to another of the river Kwai.  Saito also tells him that if the men work hard, they will be treated well.    This whole conversation takes place right before the American grave-digger, Shears (Holden), held prisoner by the Japanese.  He also witnesses a little scene where Nicholson comes incredibly close to getting shot and so he understands just how hard-headed he is.  But Shears's only goal is to escape and that he does.    After his escape, Shears accidentally hooks up with Major Warden (Jack Hawkins) who he doesn't know.  However, Warden, with the help of Nicholson's private work in the prison camp, knows a lot about Shears.  He explains to Shears that Nicholson is one of his men and that his platoon surrendered because that's what Warden had ordered Nicholson to do.  He also tells Shears that he gave that order because he knew about Saito's plan to build a bridge and that Nicholson's mission was to (WARNING: SPOILER) blow-up the bridge when the Japanese train which contains the ammunitions and weapons is passing on it.  And since Shears was able to escape from the camp, Warden convinces him to help him get close to the prison camp to set-up the explosives.  'The bridge on the river Kwai' is a gripping, flawless movie and even though I said that Holden nearly steals the show with his performance as Shears, Guinness's performance is excellent as well.  Hawkins delivers a great performance as well and Lean's directing is nothing else than perfect. He seems to have that touch of being able to make three to four hours long movies without boring the viewer.  'The bridge on the river Kwai' was ranked #13 on AFI's list of their 100 all-time best movies which is exactly the rank it deserved.  It is really exceptional.",10,6,12,18 September 1999
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Nicholson's all-time performance.
","Probably one of the hardest psychological movies ever if not THE hardest, Milos Forman's classic is still brilliant.  Script, acting, and directing are flawless.  Nicholson plays Randall P. McMurphy, a free-spirited man sent to the mental institute for statutory rape and other previous convictions. 
  The only difference between Randall and the other patients is that he is very lucid of what is going on in that institute and he is especially conscious of the fact that the evil head-nurse, nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher in her Oscar-winning performance) is there only to make sure that the crazy become crazier.    There are many great scenes in this gem (like the ending).  However, if a drop of blood makes you faint, you'll never be able to watch this one.  It's an excellent movie.",10,1,3,26 August 1999
The Green Mile," Inferior to 'The Shawshank redemption'
","'The Green Mile' will have excellent chances at the Oscars because 'Th Shawshank redemption' was over-looked at the Oscars in 1994.  But it isn't as good as 'The Shawshank redemption' probably because it isn't realistic at all.  However, the acting level can be compared because Morgan Freeman and Tom Hanks are both very good actors.  As for the directing, I think Darabont did a better job with 'The Shawshank redemption' than with 'The Green Mile'. 'The Green Mile' is a very good movie however and deserves to make it to the Oscars and in many categories.  Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks) works on death row at the local prison.  Death row at his prison is called the green mile because the floor on which the men walk going towards the execution room is green.  Paul has a bad urinal infection that year.  But aside from that everything is fine.  Also, since the men who are going to be executed there are practically as many as the guards, well the guards have befriended them.  But one day, John Coffee (Michael Clarke Duncan) is sent to the green mile.  This man looks like he could kill a man by blowing him over.  He is even bigger than one of the guards named Brutus (David Morse).  But once he is locked up, routine-life on the green mile starts again.  One day however, while everyone is minding their own business, John calls Paul and asks him to grab his hand.  As soon as Paul grabs John's hand, John pulls him toward his cell and after a few seconds, he lets Paul go.  Paul instantly goes to the bathroom and realizes his urinal infection has gone away.  That was John's biggest secret.  The man is able to make miracles and soon starts  changing many things on the green mile.  All the guards deliver great performances and Michael Clarke Duncan walks away with the movie.  I'm sure you'll be seeing him in the nomination list for best-supporting actor at the Oscars.  As for the movie itself, I think I found it inferior to 'The Shawshank redemption' especially because it wasn't that realistic and Michael Clarke Duncan had a Jesus-like personality performing miracles and saving people's lives but he still delivers a terrific performance.  As for Frank Darabont, well chances are you'll be seeing his name in the best director nomination list if not this year's winner.",8,0,0,20 January 2000
Stalag 17," Holden's best performance ever.
","To all you people out there who believe Holden won an Oscar in 'Stalag 17' simply because he hadn't won in 'Sunset boulevard', watch it again. Holden teamed up with director Billy Wilder to create a hilarious parody of German P.O.W. camps during WWII.If I had to make a list of my top 10 most arrogant characters in cinema history, my #1 would be Holden as Sefton in this masterpiece.  But it isn't only Holden's performance that makes this movie great.  The supporting performances are great and so is Wilder's directing.  The scene where Holden is caught by all his bunk-mates while giving the German guard all the goodies so that the guard can tell him who the stoolie is is absolutely genius because his bunk-mates are then sure he might be the stoolie.There are many scenes of extreme laughter, especially the ones with 'Animal' who is obsessed with Betty Grable.  It is a true cinema masterpiece and I highly recommend it.",10,3,6,16 August 1999
Platoon," The first casualty of war IS innocence.
","It didn't take long for Oliver Stone to make a name for himself. Beginning with his Oscar-winning script for 'Midnight express', he has continued making great scripts and movies all along the years.  However, not that many people knew him or followed his career even after he won that Oscar except for his biggest fans.  So 'Platoon' could be considered to be his breakthrough movie and not only because it won Oscars for best picture and a best director one for him, but because it was really good. 
  Chris (Charlie Sheen) has dropped out of college to volunteer for the army to go to Vietnam.  But once he gets there, he realizes that the war really isn't how he thought it might be.  He sees the horrors of the war and lives them as well.  Also, there are two sergeants in his platoon and they are complete opposites; Sergeant Barnes (Tom Berenger) is a crazy man who kills any Vietnamese person as soon as he or she is in site.  And then there is Sergeant Elias (Willem Dafoe) who is completely against the war and probably wouldn't be there if he had a choice.  And so there is this hate rivalry between Barnes and Elias.  Barnes even goes as far as killing Elias in a very cowardly way.  Throughout the movie, there is Sheen's voice-over telling his experiences with the intermediate of letters he writes to his grand-mother.  The movie is a biography of Stone's experience in Vietnam and you can see how he just hated the war and considered it incredibly stupid.  The scenes in the Vietnamese villages are very powerful and the whole movie is very well directed.  I think that it's Berenger who steals the movie however with his excellent incarnation of the crazy Sergeant Barnes.  Globally, this is an exceptional movie and even though it's very rough and a little gory sometimes, I still recommend it to any movie-buff who hasn't yet seen it. It IS exceptional.",8,0,0,16 September 1999
Paths of Glory," An incredibly real movie about military injustice declaring that Kubrick is a genius.
","This is no normal war movie.  It isn't even a common type of movie because it declares the stupidity of a war that wasn't the Vietnam war but the World War I.  12 years after WWII, Kubrick went back to the roots of the previous war and showed the downside of the war which should be the one side everybody should see.  Not having yet established his trademark as the king of rough and dark movies, Kubrick made his mark with 'Paths of glory' in 1957 which came to be banned in France for 25 years because of his way of discriminating its army.   Kubrick had Kirk Douglas play the lead role which was perfect for him. the movie centers around the decision Douglas makes to withdraw his men from the attack of the 'Ant hill' after having been bombed by his own superior. Douglas remains unfortunately unaware of this fact until the end of the movie.  But after having had his men withdrawn from the attack, Douglas's men are accused of cowardice and three of his men are to be executed.  A short court martial is held at the demand of Kirk Douglas but he doesn't have the opportunity to defend his men.  The three are executed and Douglas is finally informed that his superior had ordered a bombing on his men.  His superior is to be removed from his post and the penalty that awaits him is unknown to the audience.  As in all his movies, Kubrick lets you hoping the badguy will be caught until the end but as usual, it's too late to change the bad part when he is finally caught.  A very close second to 'Dr. Strangelove', this is one Kubrick movie lovers will not want to miss.",10,0,0,28 July 1999
Raging Bull," THAT was entertainment.
","Through all his incarnations, De Niro has come through 100% each time on. However, he WAS Jake LaMotta in 'Raging bull'.  I mean he absolutely killed himself to play this role.  He went from his usual 150lbs. to to 212lbs. But his performance is was makes this movie so good.    Jake LaMotta is a boxer who wants his shot at the title but has never had it.  So after winning about six fights in a row, all fighters are afraid to fight him and so his brother Joey (Joe Pesci) decides to take matters into his own hands and makes a deal behind his brother's back to help him get a shot at the title.  He makes his brother fight an up-and-comer called Janiro.  After his rather easy victory against Janiro, Jake finally gets a shot at the title which he wins.  But after his fight, he seems to forget everything about his all his work-out and years of hard-work it took him to win the title and begins eating like there's no tomorrow.  He then has problems with his brother and after two other fights, he quits boxing.  We then see what De Niro looks like when he weighs 212lbs.  All through the movie, De Niro is right on in the role of  LaMotta and took home a very well-deserved Oscar for best actor. But he is supported by a terrific cast including, Joe Pesci as his trainer-brother and Cathy Moriarty as his wife.  It's one of Scorsese's best and has got to be seen by any movie-buff.",10,2,2,2 September 1999
The Silence of the Lambs," Chilling, scary, intelligent, brilliant.
","Excellent.  A true gem.  'The silence of the lambs' is the third and last movie up to date to have garnered the four major Oscars: Best picture, best actor (Hopkins), best actress (Foster), and best director (Demme).  The one thing that might make the fact that this movie won these four Oscars all the more exceptional is that contrary to  'It happened one night' and 'One flew over the cuckoo's nest' which are a romantic comedy and a heavy drama, 'The silence of the lambs' is a high-scale horror-movie.  FBI agent Clarice Starling (Foster) is assigned to track down a serial killer who calls himself Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine).  The only problem she must confront however is that to catch Buffalo Bill, she must consult with Hannibal 'The cannibal' Lecter (Hopkins) who is an ex-psychiatrist renowned across the country.  Dr. Lecter has a clue lying in his head as to what Buffalo Bill's true identity is and how to catch him.  However, Lecter will not cooperate unless Starling lets him in onto some of the details of her private life.  Incredibly gripping and frightening, 'The silence of the lambs' is one of those rare thrillers we see.  The ending scene is extremely tense and is probably the best suspense scene I've ever seen.  A masterpiece.",10,1,1,25 August 1999
Ben-Hur," Good and that's where it stops.
","This is a good movie but that is where it stops.  It isn't incredible because it won eleven Oscars, it isn't breath-taking because of that horse-race.  It's only good.  I know I'm in the minority that thinks that but that's how I think it should be considered.  Sure, Charlton Heston is good and I would say he's the one that makes the movie because the rest is just over-rated details.  I don't know what other movie-buffs truly see in it but I only see Heston's performance with the supporting actors.",Null,1,5,8 June 1999
The Deer Hunter," The one movie with 'The godfather' to which I would give an eleven out of ten.
","This movie is the best movie with 'Platoon' to show the horror and stupidity of the Vietnam war. Beginning with Nick questioning Michael about if they'll come back home after the war, the movie just keeps getting better and better.The whole Russian roulette scene in the Vietnamese prison camp is purely genius.  Ad to that, the relationship between the men is at no time forgotten during the movie and the scene where Nick kills himself playing Russian roulette is probably the hardest psychological scene I've ever seen in a movie. Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken and Meryl Streep lead a terrific movie supported by an excellent screenplay.  This is the kind of movie that you want to see a 100 times no matter how hard psychologically it may be. I've seen three times and won't stop seeing it until I die.",10,0,0,1 June 1999
Rear Window," Grace Kelly's best movie ever.
","Grace Kelly had all the chance in the world to prove herself as a great actress and she did prove herself.  In fact, she proved herself in 1954 by winning an Oscar in 'The country girl' but especially by playing in 'Rear window'.  Teaming up with James Stewart, she is terrific and looks absolutely marvelous.  But that's not the only good part about 'Rear window'.  The script is incredibly original and Hitchcock showed the world how subtle and suggestive his movies could be without screwing up his directing.  Jeff (James Stewart) is a professional photographer who broke his leg taking a picture on one of his days off.  So he is stuck in his apartment without anything to do but watch what goes on in the city through his rear window.  Well, he also has company from his girlfriend Lisa (Grace Kelly) and his nurse Stella (Thelma Ritter).  However, one day he notices that in one of the windows across, there is a woman who use to live there who has gone missing.  The man who lived there with his wife is Lars Thornwald (Raymond Burr) and Jeff starts to suspect him of having murdered his wife. 
  As soon as Stewart starts to suspect Burr of having murdered his wife, you can't take your eyes off the movie.  Everybody delivers a great performance in this movie, especially Thelma Ritter who also provides a couple of laughs as Stewart's nurse who is always talking.  John Michael Hayes's script has hardly any flaws and is one of the best Hitchcock ever had.  But Hitchcock adds the final touch with his masterful directing.  the only thing I don't really like about this movie is that is considered as being Hitchcock's best whereas I believe that 'Psycho' is by far his best.  But still, it's an excellent movie.",10,0,2,19 January 2000
Casino," No one did stay at the top.
","The fact that I believe that Scorsese and De Niro make a great pair might lead some people to think that I started watching this movie with the idea that it was going to be good, in other words, that I had a certain assurance that it was good.  Well I didn't.  However, I could have had one and the movie would still have reached my expectations.  I thought it was absolutely brilliant with some funny scenes and some great acting.  The movie talks about, as it says in the title, a casino.  But it's not just a casino.  It's THE casino ran by Sam 'ACE' Rothstein (De Niro).  Ace is the best football handicapper in the country but is so good that you could say he cheats when he bets.  Plus he never bets unless he is sure to win.  But in Las Vegas, running a casino requires help.  So his bosses in Kansas City send down one f his best friends, Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci), to watch his back.  As usual, Pesci plays a rather crazy character who seems to be particularly fond of being a gangster.   In Vegas, Ace marries Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone) and complicates his life by doing so.  Sharon Stone is incredibly brilliant in her Oscar-nominated role as the woman who begins the whole catastrophe and is as beautiful as ever.  However, things between Ace, Ginger and Nicky spice up and lead to disasters and multiple murders.  'Casino' is one of the best Scorsese-De Niro movies.  The script by Nicholas Pileggi is as good as the one he wrote for 'Goodfellas'.  It's excellent.  Now enough said.  It's up to you to see it.",8,1,1,7 September 1999
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Good but over-rated.
","Frankly, I think 'Star wars' is a great movie.  It was in a way the first of its kind and was very impressive.  However, I also believe that many people are turning this movie into one of the best of all-time for nothing. I don't remember having been hit by anything surprising except for the fact that everything was in space and that people lived in battle ships.  If you ask me, I think 'The return of the Jedi' was the best of the trilogy (I don't include the one that came out recently since I haven't seen it). However, I won't deny the fact that there is an incredible lot of imagination contained in this classic and that one of the reasons I probably enjoyed 'The return of the Jedi' the most is because of some of the questions that remain unanswered and are answered in the sequel or the third.  Some of the best scenes of the trilogy are in my opinion held in the first and if George Lucas hadn't invented the story that Darth Vader is Luke Skywalker's father, 'The Empire strikes back' and 'The return of the Jedi' probably would not have been as good as the are.  So all in all, 'Star wars' is still the best of the trilogy and is a real must-see.",1,7,42,31 August 1999
The Great Escape," The best concentration camp parody ever with 'Stalag 17'.
","In 1953, the Academy award winner for best actor was William Holden in 'Stalag 17' which was the story of a German concentration camp for Americans and was made to look ridiculous.  In 1963, the best actor Oscar went to Sidney Poitiers for 'Lilies of the field' and this is totally all right by me.  However, I came to notice that 'The great escape' didn't get any nominations either for acting, directing, or even best picture.  And this movie is ranked #81 on our IMDb voting list whereas the 1963 winner for best picture, 'Tom Jones', isn't even there.  Maybe 'Tom Jones' deserved the best picture that year, but 'The great escape' should definitely have had at least a nomination.  Captain Virgil Hilts (Steve McQueen) winds up in a German prison camp where he doesn't know anyone.  But there isn't only him in that camp.  A few days after he arrives at the camp, a well-known English Captain, Bartlett (Richarrd Attenborough), arrives as well and decides to take matters into his own hands by preparing escape plans for at least 250 of the prisoners in the camp.  Naturally, a job like this one requires a lot of help.  So he gets Hendley 'The Scrounger' (James Garner), Danny Velinski 'Tunnel King' (Charles Bronson), Colin Blythe 'The Forger' (Donald Pleasance), and Sedgwick 'Manufacturer' (James Coburn) to team up with him to make this one the biggest escape from a concentration camp ever.  This one has to be THE great escape.  At first, Hilts declines Bartlett's proposition to join his group claiming that he is going to escape much earlier than the rest of the group.  But after he screws up and is sent to 'The cooler', he decides to join up with Bartlett as soon as he is released from 'The cooler' and when he does, the Germans begin wishing these men never entered this concentration camp in their whole life.  But even though these men are pros at this kind of work, the Germans are able to find out about a few of their plans but to keep myself from spoiling anything, I won't tell you anymore about the movie itself.  Director John Sturges has indeed directed some very god movies including the great 'The magnificent seven', but he truly outdid himself in 'The great escape'.  The movie offers suspense, action, and some good laughs as well and keeps you wondering what will happen to the main characters until you do see what does happen.  Steve McQueen gives one of his best performances and Attenborough is excellent as well.  Some of the best scenes of the movie are when you see the Americans preparing their escape and all the work and trouble they have to go through to get it done.  It's definitely the greatest escape I've ever seen.",Null,1,2,26 September 1999
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Way too over-rated. Definitely not in the same class as 'star wars' and 'Return of the Jedi'.
","I was very disappointed upon seeing 'The Empire strikes back'. I expected more in this movie than just the scene where Darth Vader tells Luke Skywalker:  'Luke, I am your father'.  I was expecting as much excitement and unpredictability as in 'Star wars'.  I'm not saying the movie is bad or boring, but if you compare this the first and the third (or the fourth and the sixth), it just isn't as good, that's all.  However, just like in 'Star wars' and 'The return of the Jedi', Harrison Ford's performance is excellent and is the best part, in my opinion, of 'The Empire strikes back'.  But for fans of the trilogy, it's an absolute must-see.",5,6,29,10 September 1999
Born on the Fourth of July," It's only Cruise that is good.
","I understand that Oliver Stnoe participated in the Vietnam war and hated the horrors he had to live and he demonstrated very well in 'Platoon' but he didn't a very good job with 'Born on the 4th of July'.  I think what Stone tried to do with this movie was take a few of the same general ideas he used in 'Platoon' and put them in some different circumstances.  Only he missed with this one.  There are some scenes that could have been cut out and it wouldn't have made any difference.  Ron Kovic (Tom Cruise) is determined to become a marine and go to Vietnam. He even says that if he has to die there, well then so be it.  But then, we see what he has to live and see in Vietnam.  One afternoon, as the sun goes down, his platoon is attacked by the Vietnamese. Kovic takes cover behind a sand dune when all of a sudden, somebody pops up on the dune.  Not hesitating for a second, Kovic fires his riffle.  However, after the gunfight ceases a few minutes later, Kovic realizes that the man he has killed was one of the men in his platoon.   Kovic can't get over this and the next day, he is shot.  When he wakes up, he finds himself in the hospital and later learns that he will never be able to walk again and that his hopes of being able to have children are nill. But Ron is determined to walk again.  And so he tries and he tries until he falls down the bone of his leg pops out.  All his hopes suddenly just go to pieces.    So Ron returns to his hometown and after having had a fit with his younger brother who claims the stupidity of the war, Ron starts to realize that his brother is probably right and that the war was useless and stupid and so he takes part in all the anti-war movements.  But Ron changes a lot and finally he goes to Mexico where he finds ex-soldiers and prostitutes.  The rest that follows his trip to Mexico is the reconstitution of the life he lost at war.  The movie drags a lot at many times and there a few scenes that I would even consider boring and pointless.  Tom Cruise's performance is the best part of this movie and probably should have won an Oscar for it (although I haven't seen 'My left foot' yet).  Stone tries to show once again the image of young men losing their innocence at war but did a much better job at it in 'Platoon'.  So as you might have guessed, I didn't like the movie that much.  If you've got 'Platoon' and 'Born on the 4th of July' and you don't know which one to watch, you should definitely watch 'Platoon'.",6,3,6,17 September 1999
Goodfellas," As far back as I can remember, I always loved 'Goodfellas'.
","Tough and uncompromising with its rather hilarious moments, 'Goodfellas' is one of the best Mafia movies ever.  It's the story of Henry Hill, from the day he decided he wanted to be a gangster until the day he joined the Witness Protection Program.   All along the movie, he sticks with crazy Tommy De Vito (Pesci) and living-mob-legend, Jimmy Conway (De Niro) as they work for Paulie (Paul Sorvino).  All goes well for Henry until he starts cheating on his wife and then gets sent to jail.  The scenes in the jail where you see where wiseguys live apart from the rest of the prisoners are excellent (especially when Henry describes diner in jail).  As good as Liotta, Bracco , De Niro, and Sorvino are though, it's Joe Pesci who rules this movie.  His incarnation of the crazy, cowboy-like, short-tempered Tommy De Vito, he is excellent and it's understandable that he won the Oscar for best supporting-actor (he also supplies a lot of the laughs).  Don't miss this one.  It's definitely one of Scorsese's best.",9,0,0,16 August 1999
The Wizard of Oz," Without a doubt, the best musical ever made.
","1939 is considered by many to be the best the year in Hollywood's history especially because of the release of one of history's greatest classic, 'Gone with the wind'.  It is also the year that has the most movies on AFI's top 100 list with five: Gone with the wind at #4, Mr. Smith goes to Washington at # 29, Stagecoach at #63, Wuthering heights at #73, and The wizard of Oz at #6.  Personally, my favorite of these five is 'Mr. Smith goes to Washington'.  However, I do recognize the greatness of 'The wizard of Oz' and I do consider to be the most charming and most original musical ever made in Hollywood.  During a local storm in Kansas, Dorothy's (Judy Garland) house takes off into the air and crashes on the wicked witch of the east killing her automatically.  When Dorothy gets up again after having lost conscious because of the storm, she realizes that she isn't in Kansas anymore and the movie is now in color. After looking around for a while, a fairy appears and goes to see Dorothy and when she asks where she is, the fairy tells her that she is in the land of Oz and that the only way for her to get home is by talking to the wizard of Oz.  As they talk, Dorothy makes the acquaintance of the lovely people who live in Oz called the Munchkins.  But she is wearing a pair of red slippers which she doesn't know were the ones of the wicked witch of the east.  So the witch's sister, the wicked witch of the west (Margaret Hamilton), appears before Dorothy asking her for the slippers.  But the fairy defends Dorothy and the witch leaves.  Dorothy then asks how to get to wizard's home.  And this is when the fairy tells her that all she has to do is: 'Follow the yellow brick-road'.  Along her way, Dorothy meets a scarecrow who doesn't scare crows anymore and doesn't have a brain, a tin-man who is too rusty to be able to even slightly move and has no heart and therefore no emotions, and finally, a lion who has lost all his courage.  She invites the three with her to see the wizard suggesting that the wizard could give the scarecrow a brain, the tin-man a heart, the lion courage and tell her how to get home.  But naturally, the path that leads to the wizard is full of surprises all set up by the wicked witch of the west.  Charming and amusing, 'The wizard of Oz' is a very unique movie and has no flaws.  The story is incredibly original, the script is good, the directing is great, and the performances are exceptional.  But it's Margaret Hamilton and Judy Garland who are the best part of the whole movie.  Hamilton is very good and very evil as the wicked witch of the west and Garland is excellent as Dorothy.  The singing scenes are the best that have ever been directed and Garland's singing is simply the best there ever was.  It isn't a surprise that she was ranked as the eight female legend of AFI.  This is a great classic and the  best movie of 1939 after Mr. Smith goes to Washington.  But you should still see it at all costs.",Null,0,4,21 September 1999
From Here to Eternity," The best movie of the 50's
","Realistic, uncompromising, and at sometimes shocking, Fred Zinnemann's adaptation of James Jones's novel is simply perfect.    This story about military injustice somewhat differs from Stanley Kubrick's 'Paths of glory' for two reasons because it shows how two G.I.'s are bullied whereas 'Paths of glory' shows how careless the army is towards its soldiers and it deals with other themes than military injustice like adultery for example. 'From here to eternity' is a little ahead of its time because of its heavy references to adult themes like prostitution, alcohol abuse, violence, and murder.  Lancaster and Clift lead a terrific cast which also includes legends such as Deborah Kerr, Frank Sinatra, and Donna Reed (who is as beautiful as ever).  Reed and Sinatra took home well-deserved supporting actors Oscars.    Another reason for which I love this movie is that it is the movie that sent Sinatra to stardom.  After its release, he became a lot more popular in Hollywood and was offered many more important roles than before.  All in all, 'From here to eternity' is a great, compelling, realistic movie.  The Clift-Reed, Clift-army, Clift-Lancaster, Clift-Sinatra, Lancaster-army, and Lancaster-Kerr relations are extremely well interpreted. This is one of those films that are worth at least five viewings.  It's great.",10,1,1,16 August 1999
The Godfather," Perfect in every sense of the word.
","I've seen this movie a dozen times and still believe it is by far the best movie ever made.  From the opening sequence where you make the acquaintance of the Godfather, Don Vito Corleone and his family to the ending scene where Michael Corleone becomes Don Michael Corleone, the new godfather, the movie stays perfect.Marlon Brando is excellent as Vito Corleone (he won an Oscar for his performance) and Pacino and Caan are great as his sons who have two opposite characters, Pacino is practical and Caan is radical.  However, I believe Robert Duvall is the one who distinguishes himself the most as Pacino's and Caan's adopted brother and lawyer of the family.Many of my favorite scenes of all-time are included in this gem (especially the scene where Michael kills Solottzo and Captain Macluskey in the restaurant).  An absolute must-see at any costs.",10,1,4,15 June 1999
