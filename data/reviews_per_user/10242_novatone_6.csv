Iron Man 3," Some bits are great... if you haven't read the comics
","No spoilers here, but I loved Ben Kingsley in this. How cool would it be if he turned up at your house on Christmas Day and just sat about drinking beer and telling entertaining yarns about Croydon and Ray Winstone... I actually had a long think about this as various iron men outfits fought bad fire people near a boat for about 30 minutes. Finally, I saw a credit and realised it was time to start paying attention - as I had to find the remote and turn the TV off.No I don't read comics so I enjoyed the big thing involving Kingsley. With hindsight (after reading other people's reviews) it seems like a really dumb ass thing to do if you're trying to make a superhero franchise popular. However, Kingsley is still AWESOME in this movie. Don't blame him.So many plot holes here which leave a sour taste. Gwyneth Paltrow is reliably awful and totally miscast as expected - but I get the impression she couldn't really be bothered to try and act in this film - and why should she? The bit with the kid was funny, then the director realised how funny it was and - like so many other bits of this movie - he went overboard and it just got a bit annoying.One thing really annoys me - how come Tony Stark still drives an Audi A8 with an internal combustion engine? As an engineer himself surely he would be aware of it's meagre 11% power efficiency and would have built an Iron Man drive to power it. Maybe he did? If so why didn't he solve a larger world issue and just start making more fuel efficient cars for everyone? He could have based his HQ in Detroit, thus aiding the redevelopment and regeneration of an impoverished area of the country. Hmmm.Little things like this got on my nerves throughout the film, but overall it entertained me until the predictably loud, fighty and explody end which sent it into a final nosedive.In a nutshell - started promisingly, took a gamble, lost direction and veered out of control to become a other pointless waste of moviegoer's time.Watch it ONLY for Ben Kingsley.",5,0,1,29 September 2013
Gravity," 'Gravity' : the force is not strong with this one
","Despite the hype - for me 'Gravity' crashes to earth with a dull thud.The opening sequence to this film (widely regarded as the trailer) is actually rather good.It's good if you cover your ears to avoid the TERRIBLE dialogue that begins almost immediately with George Clooney nattering with his old pub mates back down at ground control, while Sandra Bullock struggles to fix a computer board or re-initiate a boot drive system or something or ANYTHING that gives the writers a reason to put these people in harm's way in space.Add to this a piece of appalling casting by making the token non-American crew member arse about in the background (on a supposedly serious government funded space mission?!) and do a Macarena in space, and THEN try and make you feel sorry for him NOT because he just got his face knocked off by space junk BUT because he had a picture of his FAMILY... Seriously Hollywood - people WITHOUT families are STILL people!!!!!Aaaagh.Nuff of the caps. Gravity has enough problems in the first five minutes that when they begin to unravel it sets off a chain reaction with bits of badly developed plot smashing into desperately under-developed characters and resulting in a tide of unrealistic science and clichés which encircle the earth, and every 90 seconds make unwelcome returns to the screen.WHY OH WHY put Sandra Bolluck in the driving seat. At least in Speed we were led to understand she hadn't driven a bus before. Instead here we are forced to believe she's undergone an entire SPACE TRAINING programme.Even as a doctor back on earth she admits she kept dropping stuff - so why let her use a MASSIVE DRILL - in SPACE?The science is incorrect but despite this I was looking forward to the development of the idea of an out of control chain reaction of destroyed satellites causing a kind of space tsunami of debris... It would have satisfied my hype gland sufficiently. Visually it would have been exciting, and it's a novel plot idea....But NO. We can't have that. You can't kill Sandra Bullock in space. There are LAWS against it.The writers of Gravity were too scared to take a step into the void and instead turned the remainder of their film into a heroic survival tale, replete with courageous hoots and patriotic speeches (albeit the sort of ones one makes to oneself in moments of crisis in burning up space pods).Then the film ends and I go looking for the vodka I stashed somewhere in the car. No wait, it's illegal to drink and drive...Damn, THAT wouldn't be a problem in SPACE.Poor. 3/10",3,0,2,24 November 2013
Thor: Ragnarok," Ragna wrong
","Oh dear oh dear oh dear.Where to start?Well, Thor 1 and Thor 2 were great. Loved those films - as someone previously said - the humour had a place in those films. It was all referential to an individual in an unknown place and out of their depth - and most crucially it was Thor being a dufus and the rest of the world around him playing the 'straight man'.Now - since Guardians Of The Galaxy was 'apparently' so good - they've gone to town on the funnies, and the plot or any believable emotional response to any event in the film takes a distant back seat. The result is a boring, unenfaging film. Not to mention confusing.I'm writing this film as Thor is sitting down talking to the hulk about fire. That's a scene almost exactly half way through the film. I haven't seen 50% of this garbage film yet and i'm Already bored and writing a review. Wow. Hopefully it will save some else the £9.99 Of wastes earnings buying it. Yes BUYING it. Marvel Studios don't even want to let me rent this utter trash.I could write more but the longer my review is, then the more of this film I have to watch.Forget Thor - in fact forget Marvel Studios, because they don't even understand their own films.Awful. 1 Star. Avoid",1,8,16,23 February 2018
Fast & Furious 6," Silly but fun movie
","I had a great evening watching Furious, I'm not really into street racing - but this film is more about the fighting and the bravado - and faux 'coolness'. The Rock seems to have somehow bulked up EVEN MORE for this role (it didn't look healthy - but I couldn't stop staring at his arms!) and his screen presence made Vin Diesel look like an ant, but Dwayne was fun to watch - if a little overly serious for such a silly film.Anyway, the runway scene has been discussed at length already - how about the bit when a car on one carriageway attached to a tank on the other side by a wire manages to pass by several concrete pillars without knocking them over (the wire actually passed through the pillars???) is totally impossible physics but you forgive it cos it's an ACTION film.I'm not a huge F&F fan because I have a modicum of common sense, so probably why I'm not upset that they didn't try to make another Tokyo Drift and tried something different in this film.Gotta say by far my favourite bit was where for some unknown but brilliant reason the director had Vin and Rock have a conversation at the end where they stand at different distances from the camera and both appear to grow and shrink as the angle changes. You'll know when you watch it what bit I'm talking about - right after one of the 'crew' comments that Vin's two wives are 'sexy as hell' (or was that 'sexy as a hill'?).Honestly - we watched that bit a second time over and laughed up some beer. It's hilarious! More of that in F7, PLEASE...!The ending is awful, considering all the squished Spanish people and mourning families of innocent military henchmen Vin and Dwayne et.al leave in their wake.7/10 for the fun of watching high budget nonsense - and the perspective scene :-D",7,0,2,14 July 2013
Joker," Chandler Fleck
","I was going to give this film one star but then I discovered the true spirit of the film - that it is the sequel to the series 'Friends', only set 20 years in the future...Think about it - Ross, Joey, Rachel, Lisa and Courtney have all moved on in their lives and left New York for pastures new, but Chandler has inadvertently moved to Gotham, and now looks after his ageing mother with his glory days seemingly behind him.Chandler had been practicing his stand-up routine throughout the 90's, but never quite hit the big time. Unfortunately he was burned-out after the tiring and endless series of humorous events - many involving a monkey - which unfolded over 15 heady years in the Big Apple.In a state of poor health - and suffering from mental trauma - the laughter track in his head has begun to manifest itself as an inappropriate hysteric outburst that he can no longer contain when he gets anxious - so he takes on a job as a clown.As the price of coffee rises way above inflation, Gotham's new generation of wealthy, white and privileged thirty-somethings begin to get restless, sack and sacks of untouched arabica beans begin to fill the city streets and caffeine addicted 'super-rats' move in. Social order rapidly begins to break down...Chandler decides he needs to try one last time to get out there and make the world smile again - but this time he has no monkey - and a series of bad gigs throws him way off the rails - leading him into a dark and disturbing new reality.When viewed for what it actually is - Joaquin Phoenix's turn as the deteriorating Chandler is stellar. It is simply stunning. Gone is the happy-go-lucky flatmate we once giggled at, and in his place is a broken man - one whose ties to his old life are starkly absent.Robert De Niro's role as Robert De Niro in 'King Of Comedy' was also spot-on, except he much was funnier in the earlier film.4/10 - because I can't see how Batman is going to fit into the 'Friends' universe",4,3,12,24 November 2019
The Wolf of Wall Street," A pointless and crass film.
","Well ... yawn.Here we have yet another Leo Dicaprio film where Leo Dicaprio plays Leo Dicaprio channelling someone or other and probably getting an Oscar as a result.I am sick to the back teeth of Leo Dicaprio films these days. He's not the only actor in the world. He's not even a particularly good character actor any more, as he always plays the same person in all his films. And all the films he's in seem to be about him.This aside, WOWS is a bad film. It's a long, long film. Seriously I don't think it was edited. It's a film that portrays a disgusting, degenerate, greed-driven conman who actually ruined the lives and futures of many, many REAL hard working people. And now he makes money while you watch this sordid bit of propaganda which essentially walks you through how he enjoyed wasting these ill-gotten gains and having sex and basically groping women along the way.But wait - this is where it mis-steps once again. He doesn't even ENJOY wasting the money he conned out of these people. In fact the film seems to be a walk-through of the life of a man who has everything, but isn't happy - at all - with his lot.Okay okay already! I get it - very rich and privileged people want you to know that it's a serious burden being rich. Wow, er ... thanks?That is literally the only point or message I can think to take away from this film.So if this sounds good to you - well - be my guest and add another wad load of cash to this guy's pension fund. I'll let you decide if you think anybody involved with this film deserves it.I've already made my mind up.",2,13,25,19 February 2014
