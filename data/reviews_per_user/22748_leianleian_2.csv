The Dark Knight," w0rst Batman
","i really don't know what is on in this version of batman which made the record for all time box office, it was the worst. The Batman voice is very gay trying hard to be male. In every superhero movies, leading lady always be on perfect look, but not on Dark Knight. There is only one truth, it was totally dark.The story was adapted from Spider man 3.Lack of batman gadgets.Cast was boring. I can't see any good looking cast.On every fight scenes, Batman really obvious that it was handled by a real martial art expert and not the actor itself.",1,15,36,17 September 2008
