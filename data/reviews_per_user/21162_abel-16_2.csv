Blade Runner 2049," Oh god....that was boring!
",I left when it was about 45 minutes left. By then the man besides me slept. And I wish that I had done my expenses instead of going to this superoverated movie. The plot is ..ok I guess. Not much more. But the real problem is in the endless dialogues and endless scenes. Not only are the dialogues really boring but they are so slow... Acting is great I guess. Technically of course very good. But far away from taking it up from the ditch.,3,26,58,5 October 2017
Alien: Covenant," Ever since alien 3 everything went downhill.
",----Spoilers! ----I love the Alien movies. From the first to the third. The fourth was OK apart from the clone stupidity. Then Prometwhatever came along and sat a new low in the alien series. This scary alien and hostile thing that was found inside another alien spaceship was scary. For so many reasons. Where did it come from? Who was the victim in the space craft? Lots of mystery and questions not answered. That really added depth to the story. Now we know that it was rubbish crap designed by some monkey robot for some quasi religious idiot reason. It takes away ALL the mystery and adds more moronic questions like why the hell do a robot play a flute? And what kind of idiotic robot learns like a five year old? I cant go on... Awful.,3,12,21,13 June 2017
