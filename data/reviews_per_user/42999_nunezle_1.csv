Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Seriously regret
","If there was a ZERO vote I would definitely vote it that.WARNING FOR THIS TERRIBLE MOVIE WILL DISTURB YOU IN MANY WAYS BEFORE YOU EVEN START TO FIND IT AMUSING!! I usually try to be open-minded and to consider all the angles of a story before judging it. But Borat was just so wrong. The fact that it was nominated for THE Oscars, and THAT IT WON ANY AWARDS blows my mind! It is amazing how people will consider such tasteless, depraved, and crude films as 'comedy.' This movie is sickening and gross. I cannot believe it was such a big deal, or that it played in regular theaters. I REGRET EVER THINKING ABOUT SEEING IT and I just pray that by some miracle I will one day hit my head hard enough to forget the disturbing fight scenes.",1,4,9,14 April 2007
