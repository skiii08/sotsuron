Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Kill Bill indeed.
","Fade in. INT. THEATER - NIGHT.Alright, Kill Bill Vol. 1 was action packed, full of Tarantino violence, fancy camera work, fancier acting, lots of swords, fighting death.  This film was molded after asian films/serials.  That is how the film in Japan.Kill Bill Vol.2 was full of Tarantino talk.  It was molded around old spaghetti westerns. It had the same flow as OLD American movies, slow cuts, no suspence. (Not saying this is necessarily a bad thing)  It's a style.The reason it was done like this was because, the creative genious he is, Tarantino filmed with the style of where ever Uma's character was geographically.  If they went to england we probably would have had an english style film.I loved it.
When it is cut together to make one movie (if they decide to do this), it will all work together and it will all make sense.Fade to black.",Null,0,1,18 April 2004
Alien vs. Predator," The milk's gone bad.
","*spoilers ahead...(besides the movie itself)*This movie was a pile of dried up rat feces that was hit by a shovel and the spores have infested my lungs, infecting them with the cancerous sting of hatred. But the graphics were amazing. With the tagline 'Whoever wins...we lose' you'd expect an amazing fight between the two species for global domination. Wrong. WRONG! Instead it's a story about Alexa Woods (Sanaa Lathan) trying to survive in an Aztec pyramid and becoming friends with her 'enemies enemy'. I don't give two poops about the humans of this film. I wanted to see some bloody action between rivaled species and I didn't get it: granted the death toll was amazing - 10 guys in like, 2 minutes. Amazing. But the aliens didn't really appear until three-quarters through the film. They had a couple pansy fights and the movie was over. Also, no suspense. I didn't feel my blood curdle once - all the situations were overly predictable. I know I can speak for myself and those in the theatre with me - this stinker of a movie got a standing 'boo'vation. I give this monkey anus of a movie 3/10CAST: Sanaa Lathan, Raoul Bova, Lance Henriksen, Ewen Bremmer, Colin Salmon, Tommy Flanagan, Joseph RyeDirected by: Paul W.S. Anderson Written by: Paul W.S.
