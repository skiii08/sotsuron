Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," horrible Movie Please have sense of respect for other cultures
","first of all this is a horrible movie that disrespects other people and shows other people in another country as a group of stupid, racial, barbarian people. I do hate stereotypes specially when they are of that level of plain ignorance. Sure i will hear some one say 'have a sense of humor'. NO, this is not humor absolutely not. I believe that people need to respect each other. If you do not care about mutual respect between people, if think that a whole culture should be humiliated in a despicable way, if you want to waste 2 hours of your life watching a movie oe sorry THIS SHOULD NOT BE NAMED A MOVIE after all it as it got no script no story line no goal no good acting no direction no kind of creativity whatsoever, and you aim for some stupid laughs see this movie. I cannot believe that this movie scored 7.8/10 on IMDb.",2,9,18,7 February 2007
