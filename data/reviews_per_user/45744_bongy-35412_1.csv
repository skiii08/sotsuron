The Equalizer," Great Performance By Denzel Washington.
",You can notice several things in this scene when McCall start analyzing the area first thing he notices is that the thug thumbs back the hammer he also notices the thugs eyes are unwavering and are at a fixed point that shows that the thug wasn't bluffing and he had the intention of killing the woman for the ring he also notices the tattoos on the thugs hand and neck indicating that he's a part or was a part of the Aryan Brotherhood and is likely done prison time increasing the chances that he wouldn't hesitate to kill the woman after that McCall is weighing his options he could kill the man in seconds and be done with it but there was the risk of the woman being killed in the struggle and as soon as the child walked in he realized that there was even a higher risk of not only the woman getting killed but also more innocent bystanders he figured the best bet was to let the man get away with the money in the ring and then deal with him later I love the way those scenes are shot no words need to be spoken it's all done visually,7,1,1,20 March 2019
