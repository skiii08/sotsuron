The Blair Witch Project," This movie sucked
","Man. i was bored with this movie before they even got to the woods. i had heard that the camera moves around a lot. and unlike 'strange days,' the moving camera wasn't bad. what was bad was the fact that nothing happened. period. it wasn't suspenseful, nor was it scary. it was boring. if you want a scary ghost movie check out THE INNOCENTS, or THE HAUNTING, or CARNIVAL OF SOULS (the originals or course). all three of those take the same approach of being scary without showing you what you're afraid of. blair witch just didn't pull it off. the 'documentary' on the blair witch that ran on the sci-fi channel was better.",1,1,4,1 September 1999
