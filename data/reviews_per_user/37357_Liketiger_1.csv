Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Such a enjoyable ride
","If you enjoyed the first film you will definitely enjoy this one.Its fast action packed fun that left me wanting more of the same. I watched the first movie without any expectations and wasn't disappointed, I was impressed. I went into this movie with very high expectations it was refreshing to see them all met and exceeded.The chemistry is great between the actors and the movie does not let up from start to finish. After walking out after the movie i was very tempted to go buy another ticket and go back and watch it again it was that much fun. The fact that the movie keeps u entertained for the whole 2 hour duration is a tribute to the director, he manages to keep all the good parts of the first movie but to also expand and make everything bigger and more exciting including the brilliant plotIts very hard to talk about the movie with out giving to much away. For me its a must watch and easily the best movie of the past few years.",10,0,0,8 January 2012
