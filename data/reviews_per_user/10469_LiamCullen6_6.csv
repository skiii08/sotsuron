It," The perfect blend of comedy and horror
","Having not seen the original movie and only tidbits of the trailer, I didn't really know what to expect when walking into the cinema this evening. Someone described the movie as 'The Goonies' meets 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' - this turned out to be an extremely accurate description!The opening scene seems to suggest that the movie will be very dark, yet these expectations are quickly dispersed as the horror is undercut by comedy. This happens repeatedly throughout the film: and it works. My friends and I (as well as the entire packed cinema) found ourselves gasping at scenes of sheer terror, then only moments later laughing hysterically at the banter between the main characters.I would say that this is not a film for the faint of heart, yet I think even those individuals would find themselves enjoying 'It'. If not for the horror, then certainly for the comedy and camaraderie. It's as if this is a movie within a movie: a mix of a high-school-problems/coming-of-age movie and a horror. A brilliant two-for-one if you ask me!Great acting from all of the cast as well as excellent writing make this movie a must watch!",9,227,440,8 September 2017
American Sniper," I don't get it...
","This is a fantastic movie. I do not understand why so many people are rating this film 1/10. I, personally, didn't want the film to end.This film is not a 'disgrace' it is not 'laughable' and it is most certainly not 'propaganda'. Get over yourselves.IT'S A MOVIE. And a very good one at that.Rather than list all the qualities which this film has, I'm going to explain to you what happened at the end of the film.When a movie comes to an end and the credits start rolling, everyone typically gets up and leaves right? Well NOBODY did. And there were at least fifty people watching this film in the cinema with my friends and I. Everyone remained seated until the closing shot on the casket with the many, many badges pounded into it. Only then did people slowly begin to rise, yet nobody uttered a word. The theatre was SILENT. And there were annoying pre-teen girls present and even they were speechless.The acting is stellar, the film tells an enthralling story, and this film is downright shocking. It perfectly demonstrates the effect war has on people. I don't care if the real Chris Kyle was a brutal human being: this is a movie. You judge a movie based on the quality of the story, not upon the person or story that it is based upon. If you want to see an action-packed, phenomenal and moving film this year, then go watch American Sniper.",8,206,362,19 February 2015
The Revenant," Stunning
","Go and see this movie. In the cinema. As soon as possible.Simply put, it is an excellent story of family, revenge, survival, and nature.The Revenant is one of the most beautifully-shot films I have ever seen. I lost count of how many scenes I sat there in utter amazement, which is undoubtedly due to the brilliant directing and spectacular cinematography: there's no shaky-cam, no quick-cut editing, and a lot of incredibly complex shots which appear to have been completed in a single take. If all films were shot similarly to how the Revenant is, then the movie industry would drastically improve.The entire cast did a phenomenal job and they all deserve recognition for their performances; however, if Leonardo DiCaprio doesn't win an Oscar for his breathtaking portrayal of Glass then that will be the single biggest injustice of the year.Do not miss the opportunity to see this masterpiece on the big screen!UPDATE: I've read an unnerving amount of other user's reviews complaining about the plot. I can understand that the plot may seem a little basic or perhaps lacking at times; however, the plot is not what makes this film so excellent, and I feel as though those who failed to recognise this have seriously missed out. You don't just watch the Revenant: you experience it. Every single element from the music to the cinematography is cleverly concocted to draw you into the film and put you alongside the cast in the brutal wintry conditions. If you've not been drawn in due to being too concerned with the premise of the story, then I fear you've missed a truly enthralling and one-of-a-kind cinematic experience.UPDATE TWO: Leo won the Oscar!",10,287,475,16 January 2016
Gone Girl," Shock and Awe
","How on earth is this film attracting so much criticism?! This is one of the best films of 2014 and people are labelling it 'utter tripe', 'an enormous heap of illogic and nonsense', 'wish I had missed it'. Are these people serious? Can we no longer appreciate - or even identify - a great film?!Gone Girl is a peerless plot-driven story about a wife who goes missing. Seems pretty ordinary, right? Well it's not. And it doesn't take very long at all for any sane viewer to recognise this. You start watching and - as you do with any mystery - you start collecting the clues and piecing together an explanation for the events which have taken place. But no sooner than you have formed the perfect explanation in your mind is it immediately swept away in the most overwhelming twist of the year. And it only gets better from there.Gone Girl is a roller-coaster; only you're riding it in the dark. You don't know where the next turn is, you can't see where you're headed, and you have no idea how many more ups and downs you're going to experience before it's all over. It's a film that keeps you guessing and just as you're beginning to (once again) think you've got it all figured out, the game changes and it's all up in the air once more. The diary-exposition format is also very clever and was executed perfectly. Many films fall victim to losing the viewer when jumping back and forth between past and present, yet Gone Girl - you guessed it - does it just right.This film ranks high in the mystery/thriller genre. It is just as compelling and perplexing as Shutter Island - if not then moreso. And let's not forget: the acting. Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike do a phenomenal job in their roles as husband and wife. Not a line feels out of place and both seem as though they were born to play Nick and Amy Dunne. By the end of the film I felt so immersed in their story that I found it hard to believe it was just a film. All in all, I for one am thoroughly pleased with Gone Girl. I knew from watching the trailer it would be something I would like, I just never imagined it could thrill me this much.A very underrated and overwhelming story that should be enjoyed by all.",10,313,469,25 January 2015
Alien: Covenant," A return to form
","Alien: Covenant has a familiar narrative: a crew on a mission in space encounter an alien lifeform, become 'infected' and have to fight for their survival. Yet this doesn't feel like a remake of the original Alien movie, or a sub-par spin-off. This feels fresh and exciting; breathing life into the saga once more.The movie didn't feel slow at any point in time - despite the fact that it does spend a fair amount of time building up - and didn't feel too long. The writing, directing, and pacing are all excellent: Ridley Scott's signature recipe.Without giving anything away, we see the return of a (very) familiar face, although major developments have been made since our last encounter, which are - thankfully - well explained. We are given answers (although not all) to questions raised previously, and given the information needed to chronologically connect Alien: Covenant to the rest of the saga. This movie goes to great lengths to redeem and justify the preceding Prometheus movie.All in all, Alien: Covenant is a fantastic addition to the Alien franchise. If you are a fan of the Alien movies and were left feeling at all disheartened after Prometheus, I can recommend this movie to you without reservation. Not only does it make up for Prometheus' shortfalls, it infinitely adds to the saga, before carefully setting up for further instalments. The combination of revelations from and developments since Prometheus, engaging cast members, plot twists, commitment to staying true to its roots and simultaneous innovations, make for a stellar watch.",8,43,78,11 May 2017
The Martian," It truly is impossible to please everyone isn't it?
","First off I just want to stress that this is absolutely the kind of film you want to see on the big screen; don't wait for it to come out on DVD! The Mars landscape is truly stunning and the visual effects look fantastic.I didn't really know what to expect when walking into the cinema today. I knew it was about some guy getting stuck on Mars, but that's about it. I had no idea that what I was about to watch would end up being one of my favourite movies of the year.The whole of planet Earth is trying to help Mark get home after he's been left behind on Mars and presumed dead. You can clearly see the emotion of those at the NASA command centre who are pulling all their resources together to make it work. The dedication and loyalty of Mark's crew is captivating as they come up with an idea to supersede NASA's original plan and swing the Hermes around the Earth and back towards Mars to pick their fellow astronaut up.And, of course, there are Mark's struggles on Mars. This botanical genius of an astronaut is forced to grow his own food and ration his resources so that he can survive long enough for help to arrive. His creativity, innovations, and breadth of knowledge undoubtedly save his life in this impossible situation. I lost count of how many times the cinema erupted into laughter. There were so many clever lines and witty comments that you couldn't leave the cinema without a smile on your face. But despite the comedy, this film was able to be very gripping and tense when it needed to be: Mark removing the shrapnel from his stomach, NASA's failed attempt to launch the supply probe, the malfunction in the base on Mars leading to all of his work being ruined, and the Hermes crew desperately trying everything they can to readjust their course towards Mark are all great examples of where The Martian excels dramatically.I also really liked that they were able to show the effect of such severe rationing: Mark loses substantial weight and muscle (I know it was a body-double, but still the effect is the same). In addition, the visible tooth decay was a nice touch which just goes to show how polished and attentive to detail the film is.Needless to say, the cast was phenomenal: Matt Damon (Bourne), Jeff Daniels (The Newsroom), Sean Bean (Game of Thrones), Kate Mara (House of Cards), and Chiwetel Ejiofor (12 Years a Slave) just to name a few.Several of the criticisms I have seen of this film are, to me, actually its strengths: the main protagonist who isn't concerned with his family back home (thank goodness it wasn't another cliché where he has a family that he oh-so-desperately needs to get back to), the length of the film (Interstellar, I would say, was bordering on too long, whereas Gravity seemed a bit short - The Martian felt just right), and the comedic element (to me, the comedy is what makes this film stand out - it is integral to its success - just like with The Edge of Tomorrow).And, as with all Ridley Scott films, the pacing was excellent. The plot didn't seem too rushed, but it didn't drag on either. Perfectly executed.If you enjoy good storytelling, excellent acting, stunning visuals, comedy, drama, and survival, then you can be sure to enjoy this movie as much as I did!",10,50,87,17 October 2015
