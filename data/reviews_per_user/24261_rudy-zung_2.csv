Deja Vu," Very tight screenplay that had me satisfied in the end
","This movie sneaked its way up to release without a lot of fanfare, which is unfortunately because this is a really well done movie.In simplest terms, Denzel Washington is ATF agent Doug Carlin investigating a New Orleans ferry bombing, and ends up falling in love with a woman victim of the incident.*** SPOILER WARNING *** Quite early in the movie, we are introduced by a new piece of surveillance technology that is capable of seeing anything that happened exactly four days and some hours prior to the present. It also turns out, that some of the present time can leak back into the past to the subjects being surveilled. With this equipment, Carlin has to piece together the events leading up to the ferry bombing, and perhaps influence the past enough to prevent the bombing from happening at all.Given this premise, the first third of the movie needed a stronger than usual dose of suspension of disbelief in order to accept that the smoke-and-mirrors bill-of-sale the operators (which to some extent remind me of the Lone Gunmen trio from the X-Files) of the machine tries to unload on Carlin in trying to explain the technology at work. Bear with the story however, and you will be rewarded in due time with a more proper explanation of facts. Keep watching the movie, and you will see all the loose ends tie up nicely.This is a very well written and tight screenplay. Give it a bit of slack at the beginning, and you will come out content.",8,1,3,27 November 2006
Stranger Than Fiction," A wonderful movie about fate, destiny, and mortality
","This movie was such the pleasant little movie, and shows Will Ferrel's ability to take on weightier dramatic roles far different from his old school Old School days.At its heart, the movie is of Ferrel's Harold Crick, a go-nowhere IRS auditor with no friends, living a self-imposed regimented life of constant monotony, doing the same things the same way in the same sequence every single same day. Until one day, he hears the voice of writer Kay Eiffel (played by Emma Thompson) narrating his life, in particular a line of prose hinting his 'imminent death,' whereupon his life take a turn away from the mundane. Faced with the certainty of his death, he seeks the owner of the voice in his head, and trying to divine whether the way he lives his life is influencing the narrative, or whether Eiffel's writing is directing the path of his life. In the midst of this, no longer fettered by his self-imposed boundaries due to his imminent death, Crick develops as a person aided in part by a renegade baker (in the form of Maggie Gyllenhaal) and finally coming to grips with his mortality.It may sound like this is a tragic movie of gloom, but in reality, it is a comedic tragedy, delivering humor in the unusual. This may be one of Will Ferrel's best and least annoying roles. Emma Thompson is wonderfully on the edge of breakdown as the death-obsessed author.",8,1,4,14 November 2006
