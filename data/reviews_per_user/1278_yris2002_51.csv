The King's Speech," A personal and historical drama, humanly rendered and skillfully interpreted
","The story of George VI, of his meek nature and his stammer may sound not so familiar to the great public, but the picture by Tom Hooper captures and appeals thanks to the humanity and the warmth it's rendered through. I do not know how much historical precision there is in the story itself, certainly the overall historical background is displayed vividly, in a period where the English monarchy began to change, due to the radio and the appearance of the royalty on the screen, which made them more near to the subjects, revealing their weaknesses to them as never had happened before. The movie gets to dose and perch the historical drama on one hand with the personal inner drama of the King and his relationship with his speech therapist on the other. This last may sound too predictable, too cinematographic in its development, but certainly the talent of Colin Firth and still more of Geoffrey Rush (whose interpretation appears as truly generous), helps make it always believable and likely. Also Helena Bonham Carter delivers a heartfelt interpretation, and in general the whole cast contributes to the high quality of the movie and to a deeply human vision of the themes dealt with.",8,0,0,31 January 2011
Angels & Demons," Congratulations to Ron Howard!
","No doubt Ron Howard is the great hero of this movie and has proved to be a truly professional and skilled director: he has perfectly understood the nature of Dan Brown's novel and the aim of the production, thus being the result a well-focused, well made and well performed product that will certainly be a top box-office movie.Dan Brown wrote this impressive thriller, made of action, suspense, paradoxical and surprising twists, with the aim of selling. Ron Howard spares no effort and succeeds in rendering the same thrilling and engaging story, based on a well consolidated narrative outline, where we find the trustworthy hero, Robert Langdon, capable of unraveling every mysterious sign and leading us to a shocking finale. Everything, of course, sounds too excessive, there is a crescendo of excess, at the limit of ridiculous, but what is worth underlining is the typical capability of Hollywood great productions to take their job very seriously, and to make a good product out of nothing, being both them and the viewer conscious of the real nature of what is being displayed. What counts is that the final result is an aesthetically good and entertaining movie: and it is, indeed.Evidently, the movie, like the book, represents no threat to the unbreakable solidness of the Roman Catholic Church, and even less to the faith of real faithful people. The fears and reluctance of clerical authorities when the movie was distributed, sounded a little excessive, too (and indeed, in the end even L'Osservatore Romano gave it a favourable review). It is not even a thought-provoking movie, at least it offers no new or interesting perspective: the ancient, and let's admit, quite old-fashioned (but probably not so out of fashion) dichotomy between science and religion, is just a pretext on which to build a strong and till the end entertaining story, still able to attract millions of viewers all over the world: all the remaining nonsense is forgivable.The whole cast prove good performances, Tom Hanks is a certainty from the beginning, being however in my opinion Ewan Macgregor (the Camerlengo) the most interesting character, and the one with whom Langdon has the only interesting exchange on faith, but all actors (even 'our' Pierfrancesco Favino) contribute to the enthralling atmosphere of the story.",7,22,43,13 June 2009
Black Swan," Enthralling, although oppressive psychodrama, superbly interpreted by Natalie Portman
","Movies dealing with stories of highly talented people, hit by mental insanity (let's only think of 'Shine') have always appealed to the public. This is probably due to the mysterious charm exerted by dramas concerning the human mind, mainly when the condition of mental insanity is intertwined with that of being a genius.'Black Swan' is no exception, still more exacerbated by the environment, that of classical ballet, where the tension towards perfection and the hard demanded sacrifices may challenge whoever's mental balance.Indeed, if on one hand I got to the end of the movie almost exhausted, as mentally and emotionally absorbed by the drama of Nina, on the other one I couldn't but feel like going to that very end. The story proceeds relentlessly, and as the sense of anguish increases inexorably, we feel more and more captured by its obscure and morbid development, until the highest moment of success coincides with the highest moment of folly.Natalie Portman delivers a truly intense and strongly felt interpretation, probably the best of her career up to now. We really get to feel her being gradually consumed with dance, we feel her mental distress together with her physical pain. The morbidity inside and outside her, in her real life as well in her follies, may sound a little excessive, but in my opinion necessary to make the drama true. Also Winona Ryder as Beth, the older and cut off ballerina, leaves a noteworthy interpretation.",8,1,4,10 January 2011
Changeling," Strong and poignant drama, wisely and intensely directed
","Having just seen 'J. Edgar' at the cinema, watching 'Changeling' for the first time on TV last night made me necessarily find similarities between these two great works by that gentleman named Clint Eatswood. Apart from some resemblance in the plot (in both movies a boy disappears), what is in common is the lucid denunciation of a perverted, wicked institutional power, tyrannizing the common people to the point that not only does not the police help the helpless, but moves against them and against verity. It's probably my total aversion to power abuse, and arrogance in any field of life, that made me appreciate both movies so much, also because the style is always so calibrated, balanced, sane. Certainly, there are strong scenes (for example in the mental hospital) but simply because necessary to the depiction of a whole system where violence and abuse dominated. However, never is a single moment of insane taste for cruelty or violence for its own sake or for sensationalism to be perceived. It's a movie full of controlled pathos, with very intense moments, and featuring great acting (the only disturbing thing, Angelina Jolie's over-glossed lips, truly out of tune, in some cases). Once again, Clint never disappoints, on the contrary proves to a great director, combining a deep personal humanity, with a strong consciousness of the means he has in his hands, and being able to use it intensely and wisely.",8,1,2,14 January 2012
The Monuments Men," Rather disappointing war movie, mixing tragedy and comedy with too much flippancy
","I usually fall asleep when I go and see movies at late show times, but I think the quality of this movie contributed to my falling asleep. A t the beginning the movie seems to promise a lot, the cast is great and you probably expects a lot from such great actors, but the movie never takes off, for different reasons. First, the contrast between the bleak theme and the comic treatment of the theme itself leaves somehow perplexed, as a result of this, every time there is a dramatic potential, it is banally resolved with some comic expedient, which is something which may works once, twice but not for the entire length of the movie. Moreover, the scenes do not seem to work together and in the end I got the impression of a chaotic scene sequence, moreover not supported by a strong script, so that the movie loses pungency in progress. The cast is delivers greatly, but cannot balance the flaws of a movie which could have offered much more.",6,1,2,2 March 2014
Marie Antoinette," supreme Kirsten Dunst
","This is the latest movie by Sophia Coppola and the first I saw, instilling in me the will to see the two previous ones. Needless to say, the protagonists in all three movies, are women, young women, living in an always definite environment, a hostile environment, being it the royal Palace of Versailles or a metropolis of today (Lost in translation), or a common American suburb in the 70's (The virgin suicides). The young girls are always alone, feel entrapped, oppressed and not understood by the nearest ones. This is evident also in Marie Antoinette, where we are not asked to take historical facts into account, the movie scores on history and politics, they do not matter, we are asked to enter the world of an adolescent, to feel empathy with a girl who was purchased at the age of 14 to become a queen, to be a wife, to bear an heir, never allowing her to be a teenager. And we are able to do this in such a natural way: in an exterior world made of feasts, banquets, cakes, colourful dresses, we can perceive, besides Marie's fun and lust, her deep solitude and suffering. Kirsten Dunst is simply perfect: her naturally attractive and powerful mixture of innocence and yearning for experience, of joy and sadness, emerging from a single glimpse of her eye, make her interpretation supreme. Much negative criticism had been spread around this bio-pic: use of punk-rock music as inappropriate, anachronistic dresses since dyed in colours that could not be achieved at those times, a general boring tone which too brashly disregards history. I totally disagree: that kind of music helps underline the modernity and actuality of feelings which always affect being an adolescent, the overcoloured and over elaborated dresses (wonderful, to say the least), represent a very effective means to contrast the exterior pomp with the inner suffering of the heroine, and the overall tone, disregarding politics and historical facts, is obviously searched for, in order to focus attention on the real protagonist: Marie as a young French girl.",9,0,2,7 October 2009
A Star Is Born," Authentic humanity and stunning performances.
","The love story between the seasoned artist who helps the unknown talented girl to find her path as a singer may sound as something already seen and heard about, but this has no relevance: the movie has a deep humanity of its own and can be appreciated for this, being references to other classics barely useless.
I did not suffer the long running time, the first half of the movie being however more energetic than the second, but it couldn't be otherwise, since it gradually digs deeper and deeper in the most secretive folds of a love story, inside which the egocentrism of every person, especially of two artists, makes it impossible to find a common way to grow together. However, an involving movie from beginning till the end.
I do not agree with some criticism about its being too melodramatic, I did not perceive drama as excessive and above all I found it authentically rendered, thanks to the stunning photography, which does not make any concessions to the real faces of the protagonists.
As far to them, I was impressed by lady Gaga's stunning acting skills, and appreciated her chemistry with Bradley Cooper, who captures your good disposition towards the movie from the very first shot, and has remarkable skills as a singer, and as a passionate director, as well.
I loved the soundtrack, and the quality of the live performances always add something more to the intimate atmosphere of a movie that leaves you with healthy tears on your face.",8,2,4,27 October 2018
The Notebook," The power of love: a good and well built romantic movie
","After a disappointing 'love' experience this movie came unexpectedly as a positive injection of sound love and hope to me. I really liked it and felt deeply moved by it, I almost needed it. The story in itself is nothing new, nor original (though I wonder whether there is still something new to be said in the field of love). What stands out is the way, in terms of simplicity and naturalness, which which the romantic story gets to the viewer. No melodrama, no pathetic script, sentimentalist excess is carefully avoided: this is just a simple, moving love-story, plainly narrated through the pages of a diary. It is so easy for the viewer to get involved, both with the juvenile passion, and then with the mature affection, between Noah and Allie, whose story simply testifies that attraction cannot be the only engine of love, and that without mutual, constant and loyal dedication and respect even the most powerful chemistry is doomed to fall miserably. The young actors playing the boy and girl are magnetically well paired, we can feel, sense the passion exploding from their bodies and souls, in the same way as James Garner and Gena Rowlands can communicate high sentiment in a superb way. Also Sam Shepard, as Noah's father, hits the sign, and proves how talented actors, used to more demanding roles, can offer highly professional performances also in lower-level movies and contribute to make a difference. So congratulations to movies like Notebook, which, although not being masterpieces, obviously (but they do not aim at being so considered) have that magic capability to let you go to bed with a soothing and delightful sense of trust, hope, or simply with the momentary illusion (but how much do we need it, sometimes!) that there are still sincere, honest and loyal men outside. And judging from the number of users' comments, both positive and negative, I infer that people are still attracted by romantic movies: in the end, all we need is love?!",7,0,2,3 September 2009
Public Enemies," Intense and originally shot gangster movie
","I saw this movie as a second choice, since the picture I meant to see was sold out at the movie-theatre, but although not being my favourite genre, I really appreciated it. The myth of John Dillinger is brought to vivid life by Johnny Depp who hits the sign, by offering a truly strong and deeply convincing performance. We do not come to know much about this rob-banker, except he loves robbing and planning robbing banks, he is a highly professional man, and committed to his job, he never retreats, he never gives up, he is honest and sincere, that's what makes Billie Frechette fall in love with him. I really liked her character, very intensively interpreted by Marion Cotillard: at the beginning she appears as a fragile woman, in search of protection, but as the story progresses, she proves strength, in the way she stays next to her man in the most tragic moments. Although we do not see much about their relationship, although they do not say much to each other (Dilliger once says to her: 'I like baseball, movies, good clothes, fast cars and you. What else you need to know?'), they are deeply in love, being their love founded on sincerity from the beginning, and the only moment, a very touching one, when Dilliger laughs (he generally shows a hard, almost insensitive face) is when he gives her the fur-coat as a present. The movie is very well built, the original and expressionistic use of camera-work makes everything sound very realistic and involving, although sometimes too indulging in violence. The script is very intelligent and made alive by a talented cast. And, let me address to the female public, Johnny Depp in a white shirt and a black suit is really worth the ticket!",7,2,8,8 November 2009
The Secret in Their Eyes," A plain plot and an old-fashioned style, counterbalanced by heartfelt interpretations
","The movie does not stand out for originality, both in plot and style. The story of a former federal justice agent, seeking for justice and bringing to light a cold case of rape and murder, in Buenos Aires, after 25 years, sounds more suitable for a TV series, rather than cinematic, the plot proves plain and developed in a somehow predictable and linear way (whereas the hint at some some political connection is not developed), except for some sudden time-shifts and some strong shots impressing the viewer, but not preventing the movie from sounding too old-fashioned in manner and style. Having said this, it would be unfair not to appreciate its heartfelt interpretations. The actor and the actress playing Benjamin and Irene are subtly paired, their individual histories and relation are not so well explored, but they get to communicate passion for justice and life, as well. It is also fair to mention the final interesting, plot-twist, and some emotionally and almost physically involving scenes, such as the one where Irene manages to get a declaration of guilt from the murderer, by provoking him: really shivering. As a whole, a wisely thought, almost by the book movie: it proceeds with a dry, plain, style, direct to the end, where no originality, excess, specialness, or simply out of tune element is to be perceived.",6,3,9,28 June 2010
Pirate Radio," A good-humoured and moving British comedy as a tribute to pop-rock
","If you think of 'Four weddings and a Funeral' or 'Notting Hill', you will be a little disappointed, being here the overall tone not so brilliant, dialogues not so sparkling, however, the both humorous and moving atmosphere of Richard Curtis's comedies is still recognizable.I think the real protagonist in 'The boat that rocked' is music, that sound pop-rock that in the 60's began to move the world, and to be opposed by the establishment as a dangerous weapon in the hands of the multitudes, as a threat to a well consolidated but no longer valid system. Among unreal situations, a totally-lacking plot, among odd and eccentric characters, what only matters is that power of music to revive one's spirits, to give voice to the most uncontrolled, animal, ancestral instincts of man. And thus becomes, in my opinion, the most vivid scene that of those hundreds of records floating on the water, the symbol of a generation, of an era that was then ready to explode, and that no strict establishment could have wiped away, even once illegal radio stations were shut down.No revolutionary message is conveyed: it's a good-humoured and at intervals melancholic tribute to a generation who, maybe ingenuously, but deeply, and truly believed in out of time-values, friendship, respect, love, and believed that music was a strong, and powerfully effective means to convey them. Even if you don't belong to that generation, each of us has experienced, one or more times in one's life, the communion of a piece of music with the most sensitive chords of our soul: it's about something emotional, but also physical and that's what the director just wants to celebrate. If you are fond of music, or simply you have once in your life been moved by a song, you will like this movie, or at least enjoy it for what it is, without the necessity of too much criticism.",7,65,100,18 June 2009
Dead Poets Society," No more words: just see and love it
","I saw 'The dead poets society' on TV for the umpteenth time, after at least ten years. And I felt like writing something about this awesome picture and I am happy to write the first review of the year with a movie full of faith, inspiration and courage. It is certainly one of my ten favourite pictures, each time capable of arousing such a strong emotional impact, that words seem to be insufficient, as too limited and limiting. In this sense, I think it is very difficult to say something new, or vaguely original about such a masterpiece that can speak and appeal naturally to the public without needing any praising words. However, after seeing it I couldn't but compare the impact it exerted on me the first time I saw it, being in my teens, and now, being a young woman. The first time represented a revelation, Joyce would call it an epiphany, I was totally absorbed and completely overwhelmed and, although not being able to get subtle and more mature hints, it was from the moment I saw it that I could clearly distinguish between teachers who meant teaching as a vocation, and those who just taught to make a living. I never had the fortune of enjoying a teacher of such a sort, but could feel those who really felt the responsibility of educating, and growing children and not only passing information to them. This time I still felt deeply emotionally involved, and still in the last scene I wanted to enter and stand on that desk, and join the students shouting 'Oh Captain, My captain'. Let's admit, that even though the student's years are far away, I still look forward to meeting a man like him, as endowed with a sensitivity and a human depth that would make him an ideal friend, or a perfect soul-mate. In the end, I can only say: see it and feel it, I have no children, nor students, but if I had I would let them see it, and I would consider it as a precious gift.",10,3,4,2 January 2010
About Time," A sweet and feel-good romantic comedy-drama
","The picture is definitely a feel-good picture, one of those which make you think: 'I really needed it'. The idea of travelling in time is not that original, and could therefore be dangerous to use it for the umpteenth time, on the contrary the strong feelings of sweetness and tenderness which pervade it make it pleasant to see and enjoy, never sounding trite or boring. The cast is great, and help create the feel-good atmosphere, which never abandons the viewer also when some dramatic moments are to be faced, since always supported by a positive feeling towards life and familiar bonds. There are some new faces together with some older faces of British cinema, working together very empathetically , on the background of a breathtaking Cornwall which is by itself worth the ticket.",7,5,9,9 November 2013
Midnight in Paris," A charming story set in a charming city
","You have to be a little familiar with the golden age of the 'roaring 20's', to be able to appreciate this dream-like movie: when Paris was the centre of a brilliant and explosive cultural environment and people like Hemingway, the Fitzgeralds and many other artistic geniuses strolled around the city in search for inspiration as well as pleasure. For me, it was one of the most charming literary period of all times, that's why I couldn't but enjoy this lively picture, which gets to render the enjoyable and intellectually brilliant atmosphere of those times. Let's admit that the subject and the setting could be enough to make a movie appealing, but Allen reveals once again to be the best director when trying to capture the spirit of a city: in this case, the magic of the 'ville lumière' really springs out from every day-and night framing, making the viewer feel like being there.There's always the Allen character, Gil, partially neurotic but poetic at the same time, but the characters I liked most are those magically related to that literary past, in particular, Corey Stoll as Hemingway, Marillon Cotillard as Picasso's lover, but above all an extraordinarily convincing Cathy Bates as Gertrude Stein. There's some wisdom in the dialogues, mainly focused on the perpetual human dissatisfaction for the present, and the longing for a more intense and vivid past, and so the contemporary Gil longs for the jazz age, the Jazz age longs for the Belle époque, which in turn longs for the Renaissance.... to the conclusion that the present is the only possibly vivid time, only if we have the courage to live it. As I have already noticed in Allen's latest movie, the director is getting old and seems to be looking for some final comfort, as if, once abandoned the caustic tone of the past, he has turned to a more relaxed and peaceful one. With 'Midnight in Paris', the story, and the way it is handled seems to confirm my impression, and the result is a pleasant, enjoyable, lively comedy.",7,1,2,4 December 2011
Begin Again," A fresh and heartwarming New York summer ballad
","If you are looking for a feel-good movie, you have found one to see. It's a movie about friendship, about failures and new beginnings, about solidarity, about second chances, about life. It's also about love, and what I liked most was the total absence of trite sentimentalism, which would have ruined the meaning and sense of the story, where feelings are never made explicit, but simply flow along with the music played and sung in the corners of New York. And what new, what else can be said about this unique city?: still full of hope, full of life, still the place nurturing the dreams of men and women, and even where an album can be recorded en plein air. I liked the warm and heartwarming atmosphere and the settings, I also liked the songs, which are never obtrusive and manage to communicate how music can shape and even change people and things. As far as acting, Mark Ruffalo really steals the show, thanks to a strong and biting performance, Keira Knightley does her good job as an actress and as a singer, as well. On the whole, a truly enjoyable, fresh picture, making one feel like being there",7,1,2,17 October 2014
Closer," Emotionally harsh, but honest, very well performed
","'Closer' is a quite interesting and well made transposition of a piece of drama: it is not easy to pass from the stage to the screen, but here Mike Nichols did a good job in keeping the theatrical quality throughout the movie: the four characters are deeply characterized, dialogues incisive, articulate, scenes are often evocative and never too explicit. Four attractive and talented actors (even Julia Roberts, who does not often convince me in other movies) move on the stage of a quite unrecognizable modern London and play the game of love with uneasiness, too self-confidence, cynicism, but never reaching a true consciousness about love, exchanging it for desire, desiring the other when they are not with him/her, and then being incapable of staying with him/her, when it's time to prove with action the love they so easily profess with words. It is very harsh in the way people deceive, then repent, tell the truth, ask for forgiveness, deceive again in a never ending wheel of truth and deceit that in the end seems unbearable and we need Alice's going back to New York as the only interruption of this intolerable and pointless game. In the end, we are unable to understand who loves who, and, of course we do not feel very comforted when we realize how this elusiveness of love adheres to real life, when we also have to, and sometimes cannot understand, if we are really in love, or we love the idea of love, or of being in love. What I appreciated is the honesty in portraying the mutability of true sentiment, in confused and complicated situations where both men and women show their best and worst, and cannot take a resolute step towards happiness, probably because, as it is said in the movie, people sometimes do not want to be happy, do not accept the stability of true affection, and prefer uncertainty to safety.As I said before, all the four actors offer talented performances: Jude Law is superb, Clive Owen very good (although it is so difficult to sympathize with him), Natalie Portman as the the fragile girl and Julia Roberts as the cold always feeling guilty woman render the complexity of their emotional inner world in a very convincing way.",7,0,0,19 September 2009
Shutter Island," Great shooting and acting, but a disappointing plot
","Suspense and thrill will not lack (will abound, indeed) in this movie, not so much in the action performed, but in what you expect to happen: an effective and consolidated stratagem to keep the audience attention alive. But in the end, all that well built tension and intriguing atmosphere turn into nothing. The different and apparently fragmented plot levels (medical experimentation on humans, Nazi references, the death of Teddy's wife) seem to be leading to a deep final revelation, which in the end is reduced to a very cliché ending, really not deserving all that build up.I have not read the novel, but know that the movie proved adherence to it, so no fault is to be found in Scorsese's work, who, in a way, put too much technical skill for a plot which did not deserve such effort. Also Di Caprio, brilliant as usual, offers too a focused, tragic and important interpretation. Good photography also gets to offer a scary and enthralling atmosphere, but in the end, every technical quality seems somehow wasted on a banal and cliché plot. Not that a movie should have an original ending twist to be a good movie, but such emotional intensity, and length (it takes almost two hours to get till the end), should come to a deeper or at least less banal conclusion.As a whole, it would be not fair to judge the movie in a negative way: great quality is evident in shooting and acting (but Scorsese and Di Caprio are a certainty of excellence), but what prevails is disappointment and a sense of wasted energy, put by the director and the cast, and requested to the viewer.",6,2,5,4 April 2010
Lost in Translation," A true love story: and the protagonists do NOT end up in bed!
","After having seen Marie Antoinette and the Virgin Suicides, I came, as a result of a natural process, to see Lost in Translation, and I was so glad to find that same delicate, refined, and intelligent touch I had so much appreciated. Lost in translation is a movie, written and directed (let's not forget it) by a young director, capable of offering, despite her young age, intelligent and unexpected food for thought. What certainly surprised me, was the choice to portray the true love story between Ben and Charlotte without the predictable ending-up in bed, which really appears something rare, used as we are to cliché scripts, where each love story makes us predict that sooner or later we will have to see some sex scene. The scene where the two soul-mates are fully clothed in bed, talking about life is simply marvelous, and the sincerity and honesty of their words, leading to a single touch of the foot, is truly great. The accent is posed on the true and deep communion between two delicate and akin souls, on their capability to share emotions, thoughts, and the apparently boring and slow pace is aimed at giving value to such delicacy. In the end, almost as a miracle, everything remains in a perfect limb of the possible, of the unlived: this is not to say that sex couldn't have played a significant role within their story, but to underline how most important and spiritually binding elements come first, and that sometimes those experiences not lived until the utmost, but left uncompleted are still deeper and more real than those completely fulfilled, as if fixed in a perfect limb of the feasible. I would recommend this movie to young people, who encounter love for the first time, but not only, to people who think of love only as an experience to be consumed, and are not able to live and feel love, to understand that intimacy comes from within, and that there can be more complicity in a single touch or glance than in a sexual encounter. The male public will be maybe a little disappointed, but it's nice to see a fresh and natural Scarlett Johanson not in nude scenes, and appreciate her as a good convincing actress, Bill Murray delivers a very good and authentic performance. Eventually, a sad movie, but also rich in ironical and funny moments. Really worth seeing.",8,1,2,2 June 2009
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Stunning acting for a strong dark picture
","This is a very lucid dark movie, where the initial plot becomes a kind of painful pretext to plumb the deepest contradictions and phobias , the fanaticism and sectarianism, the fundamentalism as well as the vulnerability of part of American society.
The subject matter and the overall tone of the picture are very strong: anger, hate, violence and grief dominate, and I honestly did not grasp that comic touch noticed by some criticism.
No doubt everything works inside the picture: screenplay and shooting reinforce each other, but they could not work at full, hadn't they been supported by the top-notch acting. Frances Macdormand offers an Oscar deserving performance, once again proving her unique talent in such difficult and unpleasant roles, and all the cast does a great job.",8,2,6,4 March 2018
American Hustle," Brilliant performances for an edgy and captivating story
","The picture recalls an outrageous political scandal which rocked American history in the late seventies, and which is treated here with a very sharp and intriguing touch. Despite the plot, what is remarkable here are the brilliant performances offered by the whole cast: I think every actor had a great chance to shine and they all used this chance greatly, also thanks to a solid direction which prevents them from becoming caricatures, despite their evident and searched for exaggeration. Bradley Cooper had a difficult role as an ambitious and out of control FBI agent, and did a very good job, Christian Bale was also great in interpreting a very fragile and yet complex character, Amy Adams was also surprisingly convincing in a erotically charged character, very unusual for her, and the promising Jennifer Lawrence seems once again really fit for psychologically frail characters. The script is very strong and edgy, and yet captivating with strong scenes and dialogues full of pathos and emotion. The music is involving too, with great tracks from those times and a very captivating dance scene.",8,5,9,3 January 2014
Salt," good action movie
","Although action movies are not my favourite ones, the fact I liked 'Salt', suggests to me it is a good movie, at least entertaining, thrilling, and being able to keep me watching, almost holding my breath, till the end. It's a movie full of energy, running, chase sequences: the heroine, Angelina Jolie, is really a portent of physical endurance, pure energy beyond all human credibility, she overcomes any obstacle, and makes you feel that energy and strength.The plot is obviously full of holes, almost absurd, but I guess plot is not so much important in this genre, being it is just a pretext in the service of action. Obviously everything sounds unreal, disregarding the most elementary laws of physics, but still action, and dynamism are what keep you attached to the screen till the very end. A good picture, certainly a tribute to the still flourishing beauty of Angelina Jolie, whose physical impact makes a difference and makes her role intense and effective, besides every excess and lack of realism. But realism is not part of action movies, isn't it?",7,26,47,30 October 2010
Silver Linings Playbook," A feel-good, enjoyable comedy-romance
","'Silver Linings Playbook' belongs to the category of good and sane American comedies, with some drama and romance, where all the necessary components are carefully and wisely rationed out to give rise to a pleasant and always enjoyable product. First, a well-constructed plot, that besides some conventions moves forward quickly and grippingly, and never concedes a single moment of boredom; then, an intelligent screenplay, that without sounding that original, is able to touch some emotional chords in a delicate way, with the addition of some funny lines. In addition, the intelligent use of a camera, to focus on the eyes of the protagonists to try to capture their inner distress to the utmost, and the emotional power of a varied and intense soundtrack, ranging from soul, to jazz to pop. Given all this, let's add a very strong cast, and the successful result is granted. The couple Cooper-Lawrence works perfectly, they are fully in sync, the former offers and unusually intense performance, and the latter gives a very promising adult-performance, considering her young age. But (and that goes without saying), the best performance goes to the always exhilarating Robert De Niro, who plays the obsessive-compulsive father with both strong and funny pathos and interacts with the loving mother Jackie Weaver in a very joyfully and heartfelt manner. To sum up, if you are looking for a feel-good comedy, just enjoy this comedy, which deserves the merit of facing the relation between mental disorder and love, with that amusing but respectful attitude, which is not so easy to find in movies.",7,2,3,16 March 2013
The Intouchables," amazing feel-good movie
","It's quite rare to find and have the pleasure to enjoy a genuine movie, blending comedy and drama with such naturalness: that's why 'Intouchables' is undoubtedly a rare authentic picture and the fact that the story is inspired by a true one helped make the movie more involving. Funny and touching at the same time, the picture evolves with simplicity but strong pathos, with the merit of avoiding every pathetic or melodramatic attitude: there's brutal honesty in representing the real condition of Philippe, as well as Driss's initial uncompassionate attitude. There are touching moments, there are true amusing moments, both accompanied by a forceful soundtrack. Acting proves brilliant, to say the least, and the pairing between Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy sparkles and captures the viewer's attention. I was swept away by Dryss's genuine smile as well as by Philippe's melancholic eyes, and the moments when they are together filled me with an authentic feeling-good sentiment.

","This is of course not the first movie dealing with aids and aids-related issues, and Dallas Buyers Club shares with them a very sharp touch, when brutality becomes necessary in order to keep credibility and authenticity. This picture is brutal, from beginning till end, brutal in scenes, dialogues, faces, gestures, but also keeps a very strong and touching sense of humanity, and this is what makes it a great picture, it oozes humanity from every pore, with a sense of authenticity which gives gooseflesh. And the greatly acting cast contributes to a fleshy and yet soulful performance. At last, Matthew MacConaughey has been given the opportunity to prove to be a talented actor, and the academy promptly recognized this matter of fact. He is definitely the central and driving force of this strong movie and his performance proves mesmerizing both in his strong and frail moments. Of course his weight loss proves impressive in contrast with his usual sex-symbol image, but what impresses is not just the physical impact but also his authentic acting, which makes him a real character and puts he drama of the story brutally and realistically in front of our eyes. It would be unfair not to mention the bravura of the other characters, especially Jared Leto, whose performance was really touching and heartfelt.",8,1,1,28 March 2014
Now You See Me," Between financial and magical thriller, promising but losing bounce in progress
","The movie starts with big premises: the abilities of the four illusionists are enchanting, and the idea of them being summoned and moved by a mysterious eye sounds really enthralling. The first part is developed through dynamic and vigorous sequences. The link to America's tragedy of Katrina, with an attack to insurance companies could also be interesting. Moreover, the rational explanation of the tricks results quite involving and intriguing, and the viewer feels torn between the need to understand how the tricks were made and a more subtle desire to believe in magic.And, to tell the truth, the picture never loses the viewer's attention, it's fast- paced, never a dull moment, but then, in the second part, something changes and the movie turns more into an action movie with chase sequences, punches, violence and moves away form those promising premises, hurrying towards a hasty finale with an interesting twist but lacking the solidity of the first part. The cast helps make a difference, although I found the big Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine a little under tone, I appreciated the boastful performance of Woody Harrelson and in general the freshness and vitality of the younger cast. On the whole, the picture is worth the ticket, two hours of real entertainment are granted, but I cannot deny some disappointment in the end.",7,0,1,14 July 2013
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Well structured, thoroughly accomplished, and thought-provoking
","Form a the point of view of structure, the movie is a sample of perfect accomplishment, there isn't a single flaw in the construction of the plot, as if the it were geometrically conceived. The world represented is full of grotesque, eccentric, unnatural situations, all strongly tied up by an intriguing and fast-paced story, with plot twists, surreal expedients, ironic and funny moments, without ever losing a strong control over the abundant material.This fantastic and yet real world is peopled by grotesque and bizarre characters, very well interpreted by a topnotch cast, everyone does a very good job, also supported by a strong and confident direction, which leaves nothing to improvisation.A very imaginary and refined work of art, where however the act of imagination and the unreal represented world are not for art's sake, but leave also much to think about the real world, a real contemporary Europe still victim of a tragic past and never resolved racial conflicts.",8,2,6,3 May 2014
Revolutionary Road," thoughtful, intense, lucid, superbly acted
","The movie is about conflicts inside marriage, about the illusions and disillusions marriage brings about, as often, in any time, but I think Revolutionary Road is much more deeper, as it penetrates into the conflicts inside human nature itself. April and Frank, after seven years of apparently happy shared life, have to come to terms not only with the real quality of their marriage, but with their personal and individual sense of frustration, being Frank a thirty-year old man, a husband and a father, who still hasn't found out what his real passion is and proves to be weak and immature, April having abandoned all her dreams to become an actress and feeling entrapped in her own perfect house. Thus becomes marriage a sort of comfortable, although painful, alibi, which allows both of them to find a reason for individual dissatisfaction outside themselves, shifting the real reasons from their inner self to some external circumstance in their life, in this case marriage lived as a burden. As a woman, I saw the whole story through April's eyes: her exterior coldness and self-control hide such terrifying anxiety and depression, overcoming her till the final choice of committing suicide. I think that her condition is still more difficult than Frank's, given her troubled and painful relation to maternity, a very delicate theme handled in the movie: when maternity is lived as a moral duty, as a solution to individual and marital conflicts, the woman is the one in the couple who suffers this condition more deeply than man, since she is torn by the love she 'must' feel for the creatures she has born and the reluctance towards the condition of being a mother when she didn't feel like to, simply because not every woman is to be a mother. Wonderful acting is offered, I would say as usual, by Leonardo di Caprio and Kate Winslet, capable of conveying true emotion, but also the whole cast deliver outstanding performances. Particularly striking is Michael Shannon playing Shep Campbell's role: he reminds me of a 'Shakesperean fool', who, relying more or less uncounsciously on his mental disorder, conveys explicit but terrible explanation for Frank's and April's condition of weakness and hypocrisy, directly in front of them, a sort of inner voice of their conscience who dares say explicitly the sense of death stirring inside their family and their lives. I think the movie is absolutely worth seeing, because it gets to the real core of human nature, in a direct, intense, and extraordinarily lucid way: a movie that must make everyone think, since it confronts many questions concerning not only marriage but the complexity of human nature, with which every human being, now and then, consciously or uncounsciously, sooner or later, has to come to terms, and the result of this confrontation is, as often real life shows, not always soothing and positive.",9,1,2,29 March 2009
The Lives of Others," Terrific screenplay and solid performances for a powerfully gripping drama
","It is the second time I have seen this movie. When I first saw it I remember feeling upset by the idea that just a little more than 20 years ago, in the heart of a civilized and enlightened Europe, there dominated such cultural repression and such terroristic means of questioning. Not that history of the former DDR was unknown to me, but probably because undeveloped at school, or probably because a little disregarded also by cinematography, it was rather upsetting. On a second watching, having assimilated the strong impact of the first one, I could better analyze the quality of the movie from a cinematographic point of view, and really appreciate it. It has a solid structure which makes every shot perfectly match with the whole, and contributes to an overall clear, lucid and perfectly built drama. The story proceeds with a quick pace, each scene is the preparation for the next one, everything is under control and follows a well marked and gripping path. The cast is simply outstanding: the actress playing Christa Maria is truly convincing in showing her deep inner laceration between her love for the stage and her love for Georg, the handsome and attractive dramatist, who knows where the right side lies, but finds it hard to assert it explicitly. But who leaves the most emotionally powerful mark is Ulrich Muhe interpreting Wiesler: he stirs thought and emotion, he is so dramatically contained, as his character requires, but, in a single hint at a smile (whe he reads Brecht's poems), conveys such a desperate yearning for true life, I think an Oscar deserving interpretation. In the end, a movie I would absolutely advise: it is intelligently thought-provoking, intellectually honest, and solidly built: a high-level piece of cinema. Really worth seeing.",9,6,8,5 December 2009
Unknown," Involving and well interpreted action-thriller
","The movie sounds intriguing since from the beginning and keeps its sense of mystery and intrigue till the end: this is a good quality, once reminding Hitchcock's thrillers, with the difference that in 'Unknown' the thrilling aspect cannot be separated from the frenzy typical of action movies. The result is an entertaining, involving pic, never losing its strong and quick rhythm and letting the viewer staying attached to the screen till the end. Set in a depressing Berlin covered by snow, always marked by the sad signs of a more or less distant past, a good photography gets to capture the overall gloomy atmosphere of the story and the mystery of a character whose vicissitudes seem as much incomprehensible as much needing some resolution, and an effective final twist as well. Liam Neeson plays skillfully, although not always sufficiently expressive, he gets to convey the sense of void of someone looking for some identity. A stand-out performance is offered by Bruno Ganz and also Diane Kruger supports Neeson quite well. Certainly not a masterpiece, but worth the ticket.",7,88,114,28 February 2011
Gran Torino," GRAN Clint Eastwood
","In this movie, considered as his last tribute to cinematography, Clint Eastwwod leaves a very precious gift, by delivering an over the top performance: this 80-year old man truly dominates the scene, physically and morally, he makes think, laugh, cry, he is simply GREAT.He chooses a delicate theme, racial conflicts, but involving many others: violence, justice, revenge, all focused around an old man, who lives on remembrance, cannot accept the sense of uselessness brought about by ageing, a man who has made rage the reason of his going on, but whose inner moral force will turn him into an example of wisdom and integrity.The real conflict is not that between white people and Asiatic people, but that between real human beings, and human rubbish, which has no colour, nor racial identity (even the white appear in a quite bad light).When closing credits appear, and you feel so deeply emotionally engaged, you can't but thank that genius who was able to concentrate such depth and richness in two hours: that's a MAN, an ACTOR and a DIRECTOR. We can just learn from him and hope he will deliver other precious gifts.",9,2,6,14 April 2009
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," emotionally touching, delicate, supported by outstanding female performances
","Really curious is the case of Benjamin Button, a movie that, besides being, of course, improbable and really strange and besides the extraordinary effectiveness in rendering the passing of time on the faces and bodies of the characters, is able to offer many significant and by no way banal stimuli of thought. The most interesting one is the choice to leave history in the background, focusing attention on the 'small' histories of the protagonists, who do not seem to be affected by what happens outside their lives. The impression we get is that 'great history' is always there, doing its inexorable course, but that our personal story has a force and a value of its own, able to overcome the greatest events. Wars as well as Katrina will bring death and destruction, but our story will remain our greatest and most powerful bulwark of self-defence, something which nothing and nobody will be able to erase. Within the long (but never boring) time run the curious life of Benjamin is displayed with delicacy, arousing feelings of tenderness and authenticity, as to underline the complexity of human life, along a line where TIME is the essential point, always there to remind us of the shortness of life and the necessity to catch the moment, being however this universal warning never stressful or annoying. Female performances are really outstanding: Kate Blanchett, Julia Ormond, Tilda Swinton prove to be three great prodigies of acting and hit the mark in an impressive way. Less convincing is Brad Pitt, sometimes victim of his own timeless handsomeness, and appearing entrapped in a sort of monotonous face mime. A movie that gets to engage the audience, just by touching some very sensitive chords of the human soul.",7,1,4,13 April 2009
Million Dollar Baby," simply terrific
","I watched this awesome movie last night on TV, and I could not stop crying for half an hour: its greatness and emotional power are really something rare and precious. It is simply incredible how the genius of Clint Eatwood was able to go beyond the physical violence of a boxing story and make it an astonishing metaphor of life. The mysterious and simple truth about life and death are so plainly but deeply concentrated in two hours. Respecting and protecting yourself, distinguishing between the moment you have to fight and the one you have to wait, searching for the great shot of a lifetime, always recognizing one's limits, suffering till the utmost to prove one's strength, standing up after being knocked down but accepting defeat as part of life, enjoying success, but realizing that fair play is not always rewarded, and in the end, feeling when the game is over, for good: this both boxing and life teach. Also faith, however fragile and doubtful, plays a significant role, Frankie goes to mass every day to expiate some guilt of his past life, he needs to believe in something beyond man, although not being fully convinced and although there comes a time in everyone's life when you are alone with your conscience and no one but yourself can make the right decision (the priest, too, knows that religious teachings do not always go hand in hand with the troubles of life). As the movie approached the end I seemed not to be able to stand the strong emotional engagement, I felt like changing the channel, but I did not, obviously, since it is a movie you have to feel until the utmost. Clint Eastwood is the prototype of true humanity, there are no sufficient words to express his greatness, and his pairing with the always impeccable Morgan Freeman make the story reach the deepest chords of the human soul. Hilary Swank proves to be a talented and courageous actress, in that she let herself be deprived of her natural beauty and femininity to convey the bare truth of life. It is a must see movie, one of those which make you think, cry, feel and cry again in an extreme way, a milestone in the history of cinema.",9,5,6,13 November 2009
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," well crafted, engaging and thought-provoking thriller
","I am among, I guess, those very few people in Europe who have not read the best-selling novel by Stieg Larsson, but, not feeling in the mood to see another too emotionally engaging romance or drama, although its being my favourite genre, I went to see what is depicted by Larsson's fans as a captivating and gripping thriller.Indeed, I can't say whether the movie proves adherence to the novel, which is something by the way difficult, considering the length of the book, however, I can say that the product is a well-crafted piece of cinema, which leaves also interesting food for thought. Used as we are, as southern Europeans, to see at Northern, and mainly Scandinavian countries, as models of democracy, economic progress and social welfare, it's quite surprising to see a modern Sweden stained by corruption and unscrupulous tycoons. Moreover, it is quite upsetting to get to know how Nazi extremist and insane ideas were rooted not so much in the history of the country, but in the conscience of people, in this case of a powerful and wealthy family, where the hatred towards the Jews has mixed with the hatred towards women, turning the lives of whole generations into a hell of ferocious violence and horror.As far as the thriller story, it's engaging, but carried on very carefully, every aspect being under control, with flashbacks constantly reassuring us about aspects we have already perceived, without moving a little apart from a well consolidated stylistic model of this kind of movie genre. Sometimes a little slow, sometimes too indulging in violent scenes, but with a strong directing consciousness supporting it. Convincing and really good the performances offered by the whole cast, unknown to the great public, but I would underline the actress playing Lisbeth as really outstanding and upsetting in her mental and emotional distress. On the whole, it's not a masterpiece, but a good and well made movie.",7,166,218,7 June 2009
The Adjustment Bureau," deeply intriguing and enthralling
","Can we plan our destiny, or is our destiny predetermined by forces outside our will? This is the main point of this science-fiction thriller, where the romance between David and Elise captured me so much as to make my attention concentrate more on the extremely attractive couple Damon-Blunt than on that central issue. Their chemistry works out effectively, never seen such a lovable Damon before, with such a charming smile, Emily Blunt proves mysterious and attractive as usual, so when they lips first meet, something explosive is ignited. The central issue is of course not original, but interesting in the intriguing and breathtaking way it is represented, without moving too far to any conclusion. Certainly free will is eagerly supported, certainly the movie sides with the need to dare and not to be afraid to follow what you think important for your life, against all more or less reasonable obstacles, even against your destiny, mainly when the love of your life is involved. The story proceeds with a quick, intriguing pace, the science-fiction and the romance, the supernatural and the realistic blend perfectly, on the stage of a wonderful and an ever-enchanting New York, keeping the viewer always captivated and entertained, and making the movie really enjoyable from the beginning till the end.",8,3,4,18 June 2011
Into the Wild," A rare pearl: when the word fails to translate emotion
","It's difficult and limiting to review such an emotionally engaging movie: it's a movie that can only be lived and lived again, the viewer just has to let it penetrate into his soul, mind and body. It's a movie that empties you in order to let you be reborn to a new life, at least to a new perception of what life and happiness are, and what has nothing to do with them. The depth and intensity of the experiences lived by Chris, as much extreme as the lands he visits (which provide an ideal and spectacular scenario for them), give evidence of such anxiety of life and truth, which go beyond the mistakes made by the young boy. Chris is, of course, a victim of an age which makes you believe the necessity to pursue the ideal, in an absolute way, never considering the opposite necessity to come to terms with real life, often hostile, misleading, which provides false values of materialistic happiness, but from which escaping is not always the most constructive attitude. However, his escape will prove to be almost therapeutic to him, since only at the very end of his physical, but also spiritual, and very painful, journey, will the young boy be able to understand the preciousness of true human relations, those which make you long for a human being you can share happiness with, as well as any other human feeling. The emotionally powerful soundtrack by Eddie Vedder helps to let the movie enter, gently but inexorably, into the very inner core of your soul, stirring such strong emotion inside, that the viewer finds it difficult to translate it into words. The word, however powerful and deep, fails when trying to rationalize the strong emotional engagement: you just have to allow yourself to be overcome by it and leave words aside, as too limited and limiting. It's one of those movies which really gets under your skin and cannot but alter your vision of life, forever. A pure and rare pearl within the cinematography of this century, and, I would say, of all times.",10,4,9,3 April 2009
Annie Hall," the quintessence of Allen's mood
","Let's first admit I am not among Woody Allen's fans, but after having seen and liked 'Whatever works' and discovered its script went back to the same period as Annie Hall, I felt like seeing it. Let's also admit I watched it in company of my parents who constantly repeated to themselves how it was possible to award it with the Oscar as best movie, and how it was possible to found a movie on talking, walking, talking while walking, walking while talking.... quite a funny condition to see one of Allen's best creation. The movie is a romantic and 'cerebral' comedy about man-woman relationship, seen from the point of view of a neurotic, nerve-wracking and too a self-conscious man, Alvy Singer, the prototype of many of Allen's characters, you may love or hate him abut he cannot leave you indifferent, and I would like to cite Roger Ebert when he says that Alvy is 'a seeker of the unattainable and an expert at making it unattainable, he is not a victim of forces beyond his control, but their author', as they can best summarize the condition of this eccentric, almost border-line man.There are extremely funny moments, as when he says that has been attending an analyst for fifteen years, and he will allow him another year before going to Lourdes: what strikes you as odd and disarming is the naturalness and immediacy when he pronounces such philosophical sentences or quotations, so that you can either laugh or despise him. I liked him, although I must admit that his neurotic talkativeness sometimes gets annoying, but in the end I cannot deny the movie is involving and innovative for the seventies. As I had said in my review of 'Whatever works', old age make people, if not wiser, more disillusioned, and more at ease with the bitterness of life, I think that in Annie Hall's script we could have never found the idea that 'Every temporary measure of grace' is the best we can obtain from life. Annie Hall reveals a yearning for life, even only for a speculation about life that 'Whatever works' puts aside in favour of a more disenchanted view and comforting final happy ending, but it is undoubted that the neurotic and sometimes pedantic nature of Allen's movies, characters, and probably nature, belong to both movies. You may love or hate it, but I think 'Annie Hall' is a must see movie for all those who like thinking about life and about the 'irrational' quality of man-woman relationship.",8,0,0,1 November 2009
Pride & Prejudice," when one can fall in love with a movie...
","I really feel deeply emotionally engaged in reviewing 'Pride and Prejudice': I am such a Jane Austen addicted that my review is more a profession of faith than a proper review: let's admit I cannot be an impersonal and objective judge. However, no doubt that Jane Austen's most loved novel is brought to vivid life by Joe Wright's adaptation: a matter of fact, a very considerable and significant one, is that the director didn't fall into the temptation to turn the movie into a romantic hodgepodge, but, on the contrary, respected the intention and the mood of the novelist. Jane Austen's narrative didn't belong to the romantic age, both from a historical and from a conceptual point of view: what she provided was deep psychological insight into her characters, along with careful social analysis. She could be considered a sort of modern psychologist, one of those counsellors of today, who answer questions in today's magazines. The movie, focused on Elizabeth's relation to Darcy, proves total adherence to the novel. The heroine is a self-conscious, intelligent girl, who, despite her young age, knows perfectly the complex, and not only charming nature of love. Love is not only a matter of honeyed words, and languishing eyes: love is a very serious matter demanding trust, honesty, communion of mind and soul and only when unresolved and tricky questions are sorted out, is she able to accept and to give love. What the movie doesn't lack, and which is to be found widely in the novel, too, is that subtle and witty irony, pervading dialogues and situations. Period detail is impeccable, costumes and locations are a pure delight for the eye. The final result is truly enjoyable, funny, thoughtful and extraordinarily able to attract a modern audience, both of women and men: I was able to persuade my father, who is an old-fashioned man fond of western and action movies and really allergic to costume-movies, to see and even appreciate it. I admit I was once able to see it twice: I just never get bored, it seems I can never get enough. I truly loved and still love this movie!",10,3,6,5 April 2009
Invictus," Well made, emotion-evoking 'bio-pic', supported by two outstanding actors
","Clint Eastwood has done, once again (but it was highly predictable), a great job, in this unusual bio-pic, in the way the story of Nelson Mandela, being now the president of a country which had kept him prisoner for 24 years, is seen through the adventures of the national rugby team, now become the binding element of whites and blacks.Morgan Freeman is one thing with Nelson Mandela, reminding him in his physical appearance so perfectly, and he manages to convey the temperament of a man ready to forgive so much, but also self-confident, knowing exactly where he wants to lead his country, and that South Africa will have to become one nation. Matt Demon is always believable, perfectly fit, both physically and psychologically, for his role, and offers moments of deep emotional involvement, mainly when he sees Mandela's former cell and thinks of his suffering past, when the leader's moral inner strength was his only weapon to go on. The movie flows with increasing pathos, bringing to light a strong consciousness of need for fraternity through forgiveness and respect for everyone.The genius of Clint Eastwood delivers another deep portrait of solid, true, honest men, and in a world always lacerated by false myths, leaves a message in favour of those universal, and ever founding values of human life, so taken for granted in words, but so difficult to find in real life.",Null,1,2,27 February 2010
La La Land," A well made, well interpreted and enjoyable musical
","If you are looking for a classical well packaged musical, La La land is ready to satisfy your search, and even if you are not a great fan of musicals, La La land may appeal to you, too. The story is the classical story of a boy and a girl looking for artistic success and falling in love, with all the difficulties that the opposition between success and love bring about, and with a finale which is not that predictable. What is appealing indeed is not the story in itself, but the way it is shot and performed. Shooting is flawless, music is entertaining but never obtrusive or boring, dances and songs are enjoyable and charming, the overall atmosphere is full of charm and soul. And the two protagonists make a difference: Ryan Gosling does a truly excellent job, offering a thorough performance, playing the piano, singing and dancing very well, and showing a very good and convincing chemistry with Emma Stone, who offers a talented performance, too. The final result is that of a solid, charming and well made musical, a perfect execution by the young Chazelle, who proves to be a very promising director.",8,1,9,1 February 2017
Departures," A very delicate and serene reflection upon life and death
","Although not being myself a lover of Japanese movies, I decided to see 'Departures', mainly because the recently released 'Poetry', which I liked so much, was in a way associated with it. The two pictures are in my opinion distant as far as content, but similar for the mood pervading them, which is indeed part of oriental culture and which allows the viewer to approach the most strong and disturbing topics in a very serene way. Here the theme is death, in particular the special rite performed on corpses in front of relatives, before letting the dead leave, for good: it's a delicate, and very respectful sequence of simple but significant gestures which sanction the final reconciliation of this world with the next, a kind of reconciliation between arrival and departure. The movie manages, very simply, and using no virtuosity to reflect upon the theme of death, avoiding all macabre or morbid particulars, keeping a solid balance between drama and grotesque humor, but never abandoning its serious intention, and it makes the viewer reflect avoiding any anguish or uneasiness. Inevitably and significantly focus shifts continuously from death to life, particularly to the meaningfulness of life, no matter how socially successful you are, to the real founding human values of life. As a whole, a sweet, delicate, and in a way comforting picture, where the slowness of typical of oriental movies does not bore, but leaves space to deep and serene reflection. Very good performances by the two male characters, we can perceive the evolution and growing maturity of Daigo and appreciate the more quiet but reassuring presence of Sasaki. I would have never believed that a movie centred on death could have left me with such a feeling of serenity and peace.",8,1,1,5 May 2011
When Harry Met Sally...," Brilliant, witty and so modern...
","I have watched this movie again, after so many years, in times when my little age did not allow me to get its meaning. Actually, this movie shot in the late 80's undoubtedly proves to be so modern, I don't know whether this is due to its witty dialogues, or simply because man-woman relationships always offer the same issues. Harry likes Sally, Sally likes Harry, probably since from the beginning, but it will take them twelve years to recognize it, they will have to grow up, together, before accepting and declaring this matter of fact. This is in my opinion the most interesting point in the movie: the importance of time, of just waiting until you finally have to realize that what you have been looking for for so many years has been in front of you for such a long time. On the other hand there are Jess and Mary, to remind us that there's nothing wrong in accepting love, who simply recognize their love at first sight and just act and live according to this fact. But there are people like Harry and Sally who fear embracing love, fear happiness, people for whom happiness is a matter of conquest, who need suffering before admitting what seems so clear, and untroubled. Actually, there is no true suffering in the movie, permeated as it is by such witty irony and disguised under funny situations, so that what prevails is a hilarious atmosphere. In the end, we get what we expect, and what is right, and we like it. Billy Cristal and Meg Ryan are wonderfully paired, they convey such tenderness and chemistry, not passion, but that mutual attraction that comes from deep mutual understanding. A feel good movie, well acted, and accompanied by such pleasant music, which delicately underlines situations set in an always wonderful and magic New York, in every season, making one feel like being exactly there....",Null,1,3,22 May 2010
The Reader," daring, thought-provoking, sublime
","The Reader is a very ambitious and daring movie, in that it risks being misunderstood, mainly by those who believe solved all the questions concerning the Shoah and can see clearly where guilt and responsibility lie. The movie, like the book, shifts the attention from the universal, great history to a personal, small history, trying to pose further questions, to look at things from a different perspective, but never falling into the temptation to justify or blame anyone or anything. The horror of what the Shoa was is out of doubt, is something the viewer has always in mind, and, given the due proportions between collective and individual tragedy, it just gives voice to those people who became, more or less unconsciously, the instruments of Nazi Germany, people whose consciences were totally destroyed and replaced by an absolute duty to obedience, fundamental to the success of that dreadful system. I would define the movie as sublime, in the romantic sense of the word, in its tension towards a possible definite comprehension of reality, even though no final and absolute truth is to be found. The movie moves gently but inexorably into the harsh story of Hanna, superbly interpreted by an outstanding Kate Winslet, one of the most talented actresses of today, capable of conveying a strange but touching sense of emptiness, sadness and at the same time a passionate longing for life. Her love story with the young boy is experienced with passion but also sadness and pain, the only moments in which she feels authentically human is when she is read the classics, which can lead her into the lives of fictitious characters, but full of pure emotion. Less convincing Fiennes' interpretation, who seems (maybe only apparently), a little detached from those events which should have left a time-resistant mark in his soul. The only flaw is the choice to use the English language, both for the books and for the letters between Hanna and Michael. I think it's quite misleading, since the question of the language is highly significant, in that is strictly connected with the sense of belonging to and identifying with a country and its history. This flaw does not prevent the movie from standing out as milestone within the cinematography urging thought and elaboration of the sense of individual, besides collective guilt, under Nazi Germany.",9,2,4,30 March 2009
Inception," Well structured pic on the power of human mind, but...
","No doubt the 148 minute time-run of 'Inception' does not bore the viewer who keeps almost attached to the screen in order to follow each passage, trying not to lose any little piece which may be essential to understand the whole. Indeed, the picture is well structured, each passage well explained, each step told and retold, so that we are led through without getting lost in the apparent maze. The power of human mind appears as something infinite, but well controllable. In the end, everything gets a meaning, every piece matches with the others. But this was in my opinion also the limit of the movie, the pretence that human dreams, which are still considered as part of the most irrational side of man, may become so lucidly rational. We find Dom Cobb (Leonardo di Caprio) planning dreams, structuring them into more levels, a true architect of the mind, stealing ideas, introducing ideas into other people's mind, as if, in the end, the human mind were only reason and control. As if any mystery were cancelled and each one became a vulnerable puppet whose most inner secrets could be stolen from deep within the subconscious. I am probably an incurable supporter of the mystery of human beings, and cannot accept too much rationality, but this aspect of the movie in a way disappointed me. Thankfully the character of Mal, Cobb's wife, helps give the movie some sense of the uncontrollable within human life, something belonging to emotion and memories, which may be stronger, against any rational power. And, in the end, we are also no longer sure of the distinction between dream and reality, which urges the viewer to let some rationality aside and let the mystery find its own space. A movie which however proves very well built, having a good direction supporting it, and needless to say, the always talented performance by Di Caprio leaves the mark.",7,2,5,15 October 2010
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Woody Allen tired of talking about men and women?
","With a good and even not so much hidden dose of witty shrewdness, Woody Allen chooses a cast of talented, besides charming, actors and actresses to patch up a quite low-range movie. Unfortunately, an attractive cast, together with a seductive city like Barcelona, are not able, by themselves, to provide a sense, in the end, which is not banal or annoying. Of course, talking about love in an original way, capable of conveying a new perspective, or simply stimulating thought or emotion, is hard work: when the history of man is too old, when everything and the opposite of everything seem to have been told, re-told, analyzed, even the genius of Allen seems a little resigned to this matter of fact and tired of talking of men and women which seem to be unable to communicate something authentic. What he offers to us is the old and trite commonplace of the dichotomy between passionate, adventurous love, on one hand, and stable and safe affection, on the other... I think too little for a highly gifted and experienced director like Allen. As I said before, the whole cast does its best to raise the film from the general impression of banality, some situations are amusing, intriguing, the solar and hot environment help to create a pleasant and enjoyable atmosphere. However, the final result doesn't hit the mark: boring and déjà vu, too harmless.",5,2,6,4 April 2009
RED," funny action movie featuring a great cast
","This is a movie full of action, but above all, a movie featuring a cast of true stars, who we probably would like to see in better or other kinds of movie, but who prove that when actors are talented they can make even the silliest movie entertaining. In this case the actors are perfectly capable of interpreting the ironic mood of the picture, and the result is a movie with true laughable, funny moments. John Malkohvic is simply great, never seen Ellen Mirren with a high-tech gun in her hands, but always refined even in that role, Bruce Willis in his traditional role of a tough guy with a tender heart never disappoints, and Morgan Freeman, well, is always the great Morgan Freeman. Ageing actors (note also a 93-year-old Ernest Borgnine) who are not ashamed of getting old and on the contrary play ironically and intelligently with ageing roles, to prove also that nowadays there are not many younger performers reaching their high level of acting.",6,2,2,2 July 2011
Inside Llewyn Davis," An anti-hero story, inspiring human compassion
","It's a very slow movie, and slowness reflects the lethargy of an anti-hero, the folk singer Llewyn Davis who wanders along the roads of a music-living Greenwich Village, where it is difficult to come out, although you are a talented artist and are in love with what you sing. Davis is very vulnerable, probably beyond hope in this sort of Odyssey, his voyage is a no home-direction voyage, with no Penelope waiting for his return, but if his sluggish attitude may annoy, it also inspires human compassion, in this case for a man who probably believes in art, but understands that art is not enough, and cannot cope with this matter of fact. The real tragedy lies in the incapability to connect to others, and first to himself, he is both self-centred and stuck on a motionless existence of his own making, you get angry with him and would like to slap him, but in the end, you cannot hate him.Isaac plays a difficult role with the due intensity and the right sensitivity, mainly when inspiring contrasting feelings, mainly that feeling of wanting to give up which makes him a universal character. The rest of the cast, although playing minor roles, help design the mood of a charming and yet contradictory musical era. And the ginger cat Ulysses (a significant name, indeed) is awesome and the scenes with Davis wandering in the Greenwich village with him in his hands and his guitar in tow are the ones I liked most.",7,0,2,23 February 2014
Joy," A weird piobic, where the cast makes a difference
","This a weird and dreamlike biopic, loosely based on the life of Joy Mangano, an inventor and strong mother who got rich in the 90's, by selling a revolutionary self-wringing mop. No doubt, Jennifer Lawrence gives a strong lead-performance, and the other actors are all around supporting her very well. This is one of those movies where the cast can make a difference to sustain and give depth to a story which is not that interesting or deep by itself, but leaves, despite its confused narration, many thought provoking hints at the numerous dysfunctions inside family. There are hilarious moments, counterbalanced by more dramatic and tense ones, always held together by a magnetic Jennifer Lawrence, who will probably please more the female audience, offering the model of a woman who does not need a man to stand up and face life.",7,2,6,31 January 2016
The Pursuit of Happyness," heartwarming, tender, comforting
","I was a little reluctant before watching this movie, I have seen 'Seven Pounds' recently, and found it disappointing (although saved by good acting) which, together with my low opinion of Muccino's Italian movies, contributed to my doubts on The pursuit of Happiness, but I had to reconsider my opinion, since I really appreciated it, and was able to stand the huge amount of advertising on Italian TV, which often destroys the pleasure of watching any movie.The plot is evidently but not annoyingly marked by the solid American belief that man's efforts and commitment lead to success, with that maybe too optimistic faith that everything will turn better, and your sacrifices will once get the deserved prize (although life often shows something different), but there's no pretence of too much didascalism, it's a quite realistic portray of the hardships of life, with a happy ending aimed at leaving the audience with some self-confidence and trust in others.The overall impression of anxiety, with all that running after people, appointments, occasions, is softened by some tender moments between father and son (at times melodramatic, but never too melodramatic) and also relieved by funny moments. The movie gets to leave to viewer with a positive sense of fullness of life (it could be titled The Pursuit of Life, since life, not only happiness, is to be pursued in every aspect), of the necessity to find a reason to go on, both for yourself and for the dear ones, with a strong meaning that there are really few valuable things in life, all the rest is pure nonsense. Really contrasting with Seven pounds, where a man, on the contrary, gives up and chooses death, leaving the viewer with a sense of sad surrender and illogical, besides humanly disturbing, self-abandonment.Will Smith truly fits the role, abandoning his rather blank face à la Fresh Prince of Bel Air, he offers a very effective and convincing performance and the young boy playing Christopher is really cute.",7,2,3,14 May 2009
The Great Gatsby," over-mannered in style, but effective and incisive
","Luhrmann's Great Gatsby is first of all brightly-coloured imagery and powerful audio-solicitation, excessive and over-mannered, as to get, sometimes, grotesque, but certainly appealing, mainly while depicting the extravagance of sumptuous parties. But this is the spirit of the roaring twenties, vibrating with intoxicating energy, and the style employed is well matched with the sparkling vitality of those times (and, by the way, you cannot expect sobriety in a work by a director like him).So, splendor of the scenery, awesome costumes and jewels, marvelous cakes and sparkling champagne abound and appeal the viewer since from the very beginning of the picture. Not to mention the irreverent use of music, with shocking covers and an hazardous contamination between hip pop and traditional jazz. The picture, however, is not only explosive energy and affected mannerism, on the contrary it pulses with emotion in dialogues and situations, and here the novel upon which it is based emerges clearly.Of course, if you compare the movie with Fitzgerald's work, you realize that some depth is missing, especially that sense of decay and despair typical of those same shimmering years. However, it is always difficult, sometimes impossible, to transpose complex literary works, especially those where the evocative power of the written word proves superior to the necessary directness of the visual image. But the screenplay and the use of camera help emphasise the inner anxiety of Gatsby and the mysterious nature of Nick, supported by the talented performances of the actors (Di Caprio is great as usual, and more handsome than ever), who interact very well with the female performances. To sum up, the final product proves effective and incisive, and the long timerun never bores, on the contrary the picture keeps its quick pace and brilliant touch till the end.",8,12,21,19 May 2013
Up in the Air," Good script and good cast for a bittersweet 'dramatic comedy'
","There's comedy, but there's also much tragedy (the global job crisis being very actual and urgent), cynicism, some pettiness of everyday human life, false compassion. There's some necessity for a happy ending, which would be welcomed, obviously, but, without revealing the plot twist approaching the end, let's only that (some) women can be as repellent as only (some) men can be. One the whole, I liked this movie, being unexpectedly less predictable than it sounded, it gets to mix seriousness and fun with intelligence, above all thanks to a good script, never forgetting the tragic background it is rooted on. Good acting is delivered by the three main characters: Clooney has always that adorable but sometimes annoying (highly tolerable annoying, indeed!) face, but he delivers a really good performance, on the whole. Vera Farmiga, all refinement and enigma, plays her part in a perfect way. In the end, after one million of flight miles, the movie reminded me of a travel quote I once read on a plane while coming back home from a journey, it sounded more or less like this : 'No one realizes how beautiful it is to travel until he comes home and rests his head on his old, familiar pillow.', and I would add, until he rejoins those true dears who will listen to his travel account and will accompany him along the everyday journey of life.",7,5,11,30 January 2010
Atonement," A passionate melodrama displayed with a strong artistic consciousness
","On the background of a terribly violent second world war, seen through the eyes of the young innocent soldiers, a story of passion and guilt is portrayed with elegance, but also strong intensity. A very good photography, together with close-up shooting, and the use of refined and impressive details (I can't get Keira Knightley's wonderful green dress off my mind) contribute to an effective visual impact. There is a taste for figurative art, for example the love scene in the library is, for a moment, fixed on the two lovers leaned against the bookshelves in a sort of chiaroscuro painting, passionate and refined at the same time. The handling of the whole story may appear too melodramatic, and unrealistic, but I think it is the result of a precise choice by the director, due to his conception of art, in terms of expectations from the public, and this is also evident in the final 'revelation': the idea that the work of art, being it a novel or a movie, should provide the reader or the viewer with something unattainable in real life, representing but transcending reality, playing with time, situations and endings. Obviously, the moment comes when we have to go back to hard facts, and the last scenes starring Vanessa Redgrave (whose uncontroversial talent makes the difference) remind us of this. When she enters the scene the emotional and visual climax of the movie is reached: her wrinkled face with her wonderful blue eyes could speak by themselves, truly astonishing. The whole movie is very well performed, Keira Knightley playing Cecilia and James McAvoy playing Robbie are attractive and seductive by themselves and, when paired, spread pure chemistry all around. Also the girl playing the young Briony Tallis seems very promising.",8,0,0,30 November 2009
