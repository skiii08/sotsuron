Blade Runner 2049," A true masterpiece
","I have never been this satisfied after leaving a theatre. The original film is one of my favorites and I was interested to see what Denis would do with it. I was completely blown away by his cold, dark, and somehow beautiful world. From the opening shot I was in awe at the beauty, visually and musically. Every performance is fantastic with the highlight being Gosling. The story was fresh while still paying respect to the original. While it is very long, it still manages to constantly keep the audience in awe or in complete suspense. The dark noir style and themes still releases an uplifting and satisfying ending. I loved everything about this film and if you love the original film, or love film in general, this is a worthwhile experience.",10,3,9,6 January 2018
Predator," An all time classic
","Predator is the best multi-genred film of all time. It perfectly blends action, science fiction, horror, and mystery while also having elements of a slasher and thriller. Every thing is so memorable and well written. The charecters are likeable, the suspense is fantastic, the pacing is perfect, and the action is unforgettable. There are too many one liners and great bits of dialogue to count. Its as close to perfect as a movie can get.",10,2,3,19 September 2018
