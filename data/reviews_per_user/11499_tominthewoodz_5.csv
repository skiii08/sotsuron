The Blair Witch Project," NOT scary!
","The Blair Witch Project was NOT a scary movie. By the time the movie was over I was still waiting for the 'scary' stuff to happen. I don't understand how anyone could possibly call this a 'horror' movie. It was just boring and terribly over-rated. I still can't believe they made a second Blair Witch movie, and there will be a THIRD Blair Witch film. I don't think anyone will be seeing that one. I didn't waste my time on the second film and I know for a fact I won't waste any time on the 3rd one. Out of 10 I give this film 3.3/10",3,0,2,11 March 2001
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Why I hated this film
","I'm not a Star Wars fan and I have not seen the other Star Wars movies. But, I don't need to see them to know that this is one of the worst movies ever made. Jar Jar Binks and Anakin (Jake Lloyd) are the most annoying characters I have ever seen on screen. I will never understand why George Lucas decided to cast Jake Lloyd as Anakin. His acting is awful in this movie. Natalie Portman as Queen Amidala is no better. I won't even mention Jar Jar Binks. We all know how pathetic he was. In short; the plot is lame, the acting is awful, and the effects are OK. The effects alone could not save this film. If you have not seen this poor excuse for a movie, then don't bother renting it. Save your money for coffee or something. Out of 10 I give this movie 1.1/10",1,30,57,11 March 2001
The Sound of Music," Sappy
","I had the misfortune of seeing most of this sappy movie several months ago. I didn't watch the whole movie, but the first half tells all. This movie is 100% garbage. The songs are annoying, and they add nothing to the movie. The acting is worse, and the plot is lame. If you are a fan of sappy musicals, then this is the movie for you. If you hate sappy movies, then don't waste your time on this cr*p. Out of 10 I give this movie 1.1/10",1,15,51,12 March 2001
American Pie," Waste of time
","I don't care what anyone says! This movie was AWFUL! I hated everything about this boring, pathetic, unfunny waste of time. I would have walked out of the theater, when I had the misfortune of seeing this movie, if I wasn't stuck in the middle of the theater. Don't waste your time on this pathetic 'comedy'. Out of 10 I give this movie -10.-10/10",1,17,41,11 March 2001
American Beauty," Not the best film of 1999.
","This movie was OK, but it certainly didn't deserve the Oscar for best picture. All the characters in this film are weird and sometimes dull. The plot is slow developing, and the end of the film is stupid and pointless. In short this is just another over rated 'best picture' of the year. I give this movie 5/10.5/10",5,0,0,11 March 2001
