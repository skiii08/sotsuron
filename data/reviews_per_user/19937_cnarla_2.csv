Changeling," One good man in a den of thieves
","You know I don't care if this movie deviated from the real life experiences. It is JMS writing some wonderful, thought provoking scenes and lines.As a B5 fan I have to admit to liking the lines which mirrored some of the beliefs he borough up in B5.I am not ashamed to say that while watching this movie I had goose bumps and shivers running up my spine, I also cried and cheered.This is one woman saying to city hall NO! and to quote B5 again she just had to say it one more time then they asked although in this case it was not so much saying no as @@#$@# you and the horse you rode in on. That by itself made the film worth it. As well as watching the Dr getting punched. Okay so I am a feminist who felt a huge rush of emotion watching women fight for the right to be recognised as intelligent human.I admit that as the man was taken to be hung I thought good! Then as I watched the scene I was cursing JMS as the horrid, grim, inhuman nature of a hanging was shown and you are left to rethink your beliefs. And from what I understand it was still not as realistic as it could have been. Then of course you start thinking about other forms of capital punishment and wonder if they are any less humane. All this while trying to watch and keep track of the movie.Then the treatment at the hospital and the thought that we really have not moved on a great deal.The one good cop in the film (our good man in a den of thieves) had me on the edge of my seat (literally) Would he listen? and then do what needed to be done? His sympathy for the boy who had killed or help to kill so many touched me. This was a child he could of hated and punished who no one had any reason to like and feel sympathy for, a child who had been so traumatised he would probably never get over it. What are we like today with children who kill? Do we shown them any sympathy or compassion. He treated this boy with respect. If the scenes are from transcripts of the interview. Did Walter Collins escape? The big question and one to which we will never get an answer as even if he did escape the chances of him still being alive (at about 92) are slim. He obviously had courage and a will to survive. I believe if he did escape he would of tried to get back to his mother. So sadly I believe he did not make it out of the farm. Or did not survive after the escape.I have no knowledge of the actual events and have not looked for them as I wanted to see the film by itself. Don't go if you just want a thriller or who done it. JMS writes neither with out making you think a lot deeper.I walked out with my head buzzing. A brilliant film.",10,6,9,6 February 2009
Stardust," One of the best movies I have seen in a long while
","I read the book ages ago and while I can remember the story line there were some details I had missed. Watching the movie I kept on going oh yes I remember that. There were some bits I did not remember, so how accurate this is to the book I can not say.As a movie is was glorious. The vibrancy of the scenes, the acting by various people. There was nothing to fault. The spry old guy that guards the hole in the wall.Robert De Nero is going to take a long time to live down the pirate scene, each time I see him now that is how I am going to remember him.I think this is a real triumph for the fantasy world. With so many books being turned into drivel on the screen it is wonderful to see one that still has its sparkle and allows you to spend 90 odd minutes in a world of imagination.The dead sons (who could only really get along when dead) I found very amusing. Michele checking out her pert new bottom was a hoot.The actors were well picked and did a fantastic performance.But still Robert De Nero in drag is going to take a long time to get over. I laughed till I cried.",10,6,8,30 December 2007
