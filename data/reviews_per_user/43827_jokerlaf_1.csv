Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It's good ONLY on the second viewing.
","It's Star Wars....expectations are high for the people who grew up with the first Trilogy.  Let downs were a plenty after seeing the movie the first time.  Jar-Jar is annoying as can be and detracts away from the dialog and surroundings of the other characters.  Darth Maul's screen time was considerably short lived and should have been implemented more with the Jedis.  The visual effects overwhelmed them movie completely and makes you wonder if those are even real actors on the screen and not just computer generated ones.  The dialog was that of a cheap porn flick (well, they all are I guess) and needs to be worked on the second time around in Episode II. Viewing one is over...Viewing two....you realize 'it's Star Wars and it is supposed to be cheesy and goofy at times' and you enjoy the movie so much more.  I give it an 8.",8,0,0,28 May 1999
