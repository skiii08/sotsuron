Deja Vu," Well done entertaining movie!
",Let's face it. nowadays you go to the local cinema to look at a movie and 99% of the time you can see the ending coming half way thru the movie.This movie is quite different from that because it does not sell you the ending until the actual end which is great. Yes the movie is far fetched but it is so wheel written that it all makes sense and there are more twists and turns in this movie than a formula one course. This helps make the movie entertaining.Denzel is superb and driven. Th rest of the actors do as well as Denzel with their screen time.All in all i can say it has been a long time since i watched a movie that good and it was made years ago!,9,5,8,27 March 2011
Man of Steel," Best Super hero movie ever! Period! A must see!
","I was apprehensive about the movie from the start and was not sure that it would measure up but i was surprised how epic this film was. From the get go you are thrown into it and the rest is a fun epic ride all the way to the end. I have never seen a movie with so much intense action that does the movie justice. This easily beats the Batmans, the Iron Mans and the avengers flick for both scope and cheer visual spectacle.The actors are spot on. The storyline is intelligent and make sense for this generation. There are no real sissy romantic moments for lack of better term that don't fit and derails the storyline. The visual are just above anything else i have seen so far in an action Sci-fi flick.The costume of Superman works and the rest of the costumes in the movie make sense. Nothing looks fake and is extremely well done special effects wise.The music is awesome. I thought that nobody could beat John Williams score from the original movie but Hans Zimmer has done a fantastic job with the themes of the movie.The only thing i can say that is negative about the movie is that Superman/Clark is a little bit too naive looking in this one both as superman and has Clark but i am sure he is going to gain maturity as he goes on into the other films.When i got out of the theatre after the show i heard someone say that it was a little too over the top. I have to completely disagree. Its a Superman film, it has to be epic. I would have hated to see Superman pick up daisies or have lame fights thru out the film.If you are into comic books you know that this film fits and works. If you are not into comics, you will see this as an action flick that you may or may not like because of the intensity. We have had a lot of intense films graphic wise in the recent past and people are getting used to them so seeing Superman smash thru a city block can be considered either epic from a comic fan or just another action scene for an action film person's perspective. So you have to judge the films based on your taste i would say.But Comic fans owe themselves to go. This sets the bar real high for upcoming Super Hero films.Superman also does something i never expected in the film. I wont tell you what it is but it changes the way i see the legend. My jaw dropped when i saw this. I never saw it coming. That moment was well done but not well handled after, the moment was washed or brushed off as not significant after it happened but it will stay in your mind forever and i am sure it will spark a lot of debates down the road.An epic masterpiece! Now all we need is to have a Doomsday fight!",10,2,5,16 June 2013
The Hangover Part II," Still fun and a good time to have to
","This movie was a lot of fun to watch. The cast is funny as always and the story is very good. For those complaining just don't watch it, simple as that. A comedy is probably the hardest type of movie to write because it has to be 'funny' and it hard nowadays to write something funny because most of everything funny has been done over and over.That being said, you can go different ways in your comedy but this movie is the type of comedy i like,it has a plot, is mature and it not a brain dead mishmash of stupid things or stunts or language that a lot of younger kids like. It is old fashion comedy and i hope they do more of this series.It is not going to change your world but if you want a break from reality, this movie is it!",9,10,12,27 June 2011
