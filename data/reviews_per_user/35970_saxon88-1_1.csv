Iron Man 3," Better than Expected
","I am a huge fan of the first Iron Man, and I didn't expect much from this one after the second. I honestly kinda just went to see RDJ. It's not a fantastic film, story and character are lacking, plot and dialogue also fall short. But I think it's best to come at different films from different angles. I realized I didn't go to the theater to think, in this case, I went to laugh, be entertained and I was. It was as funny, if not funnier than the Avengers, and it was all around bad ass. I left the theater wanting to be Iron Man (like everyone else). If there was a 4th I would most definitely go see it. I understand the only reason it was made was for the box office, but that is because it is a likable film with likable characters.",7,0,3,31 May 2013
