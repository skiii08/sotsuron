Mission: Impossible III," Mild movie
","This movie was OK not the best... Tom cruise does a very good performance in it... It had a lot of action and adventure in it. I'm a fan of Mission Impossible #1, #2 was not very good, 3#, OK pretty good. The movie started off a little weird and i didn't like it, But the end made up for it. Very good ending. MI3 reminded me of a copy of James bond that is really why i didn't like it as much as #1. But other than that the movie was all around good. I am a fan of Tom Cruise's and his proforma in it was very good. I suggest that Cruise fans see this movie because his performance in it was good. Toms the man in this movie once again.",6,0,1,8 September 2006
Spider-Man 3," Another Good Spidey
","Well I just got back from seeing Spiderman 3 and I have too say that it was pretty good. I enjoyed most of the movie, I really liked the fight scenes in it. The end of the movie was the best, I am not going to say what happened because I do not want to give it away to people that haven't seen the movie yet. Lets just say you will be happy, surprised, and shocked! James Franco 'Goblin' and Thomas Haden Church 'Sandman' really gave it their all in this movie. Them two really did great and made this experience all the better, Great acting! I think that they kind of butchered evil Spider Man a bit when he didn't have his costume on,it kind of got a little weird, making the movie feel more like a comedy than and action fantasy kind of movie.But overall the movie was Great! 8/10 for me",8,1,2,4 May 2007
The Last Samurai," Best Performance
","This is in my opinion Toms 'BEST' Performance. I loved the movie, it was unbelievable, 'SO INTENSE!!!' the movie was great Really good Visuals, Good fight scenes, good acting, good effects, and a 'GREAT PLOT'. The movie was probably one of the most heroic movies I've ever seen next to 'saving Private Ryan'. It was just so amazing it looked so much like the fights were real. Like they took real war from back in the day and put it into this film. So real. The end of the movie was so sad =(. But it was a great ending i loved it. If you are a Tom Cruise fan and haven't seen this movie yet then you better run out right now and Rent//Buy it cause it is Unbelievable!",9,1,4,8 September 2006
War of the Worlds," Very good
","Very good movie a TON I mean a TONNNNN! of action in it... Non stop action. Its a great thriller also. I loved Mostly every moment of the movie it was very good, Another one of Toms Masterpiece performances. =). Dakota Fanning 'Not sure if spelled Right'. was a great actor in this movie also. The movie was so realistic it made me feel like i was actually in the movie... Some of the scenes even made me jump and i had to look behind me to make sure that there was no aliens behind me =). Nut overall the movie was fantastic, Great plot loved it. Tom should do more movies like that he was great in it. One of his best films ever!!! If you haven't seen it yet you better get out and get it.",7,0,5,8 September 2006
Pineapple Express," Why in the world?
","Bummer, The one great word to describe this movie. I Really expected this movie to be a lot better. It was a major disappointment. The movie was way too long, it had a lot of failed comedy in it, and it really over exaggerated Pot smokers. Ill admit some stuff was funny in it but it was definitely a let down. Im not quite sure how this movie managed to make it into theaters, and also I do not get why James Franco would even agree to such a stupid movie and part. If I could I would love to get my $7USD back and go see the dark knight again. At least that movie wasn't a let down like this one. My overall rating for this film is a 4/10",4,75,141,22 August 2008
