Lucky Number Slevin," Chaos, surprise, great cast, great movie!
","In one year, only two or three movies can be truly marked as 10 out of 10. So you wait and you wait for them, watching countless others, some good, and some bad. But all that waiting is worth it when you stumble upon this kind of movies. Like Lucky Number Slevin. Yes, this is truly and sincerely a 10 out of 10 piece. Saw it twice in a row tonight, that's how great it is.It's not just the great acting, the seemingly chaotic plot which turns me and the almost total impossibility of predicting what will happen next. No. It's not only that. There's even more to it. There are surprises. What's bigger and better than an unpredictable movie? A surprising movie! And this one certainly is surprising.The soundtrack is also good and fits the movie very well. And in the end, when things start to fit together you get that excellent satisfaction feeling, which is however even then, shadowed by the prospect of the gruesome ending. But enough said, since I refuse to get in the action of the movie. You will have to discover that by yourself because I simply cannot bare to deprive you of such pleasure! This one is a must see!",10,4,14,10 June 2006
