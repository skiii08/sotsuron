The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," It was OK
","The movie starts at a slow pace and that pace is kept. There are more actions scenes at a great scale... but the tempo of the movie is slow. There are some powerful scenes and Jennifer Lawrence shines through. Maybe she is not the Katniss Everdeen that you had in mind after you've read The Hunger Games Books. But she is good, she is good indeed. I was curious about Josh Hutcherson. In this third movie, his character is like a new territory, a wild one. I think, the actor was waiting for this new phase to start. This is his opportunity to shine. He has a very shocking scene and he delivers some very intense acting . But we have to wait to Mockingjay Part 2 to see more of Josh and if he can pull it off. There's a lot more of Liam Hemsworth. He is OK. He has the opportunity to show his acting skills. Julianne Moore is a very good Alma Coin, joyless, cunning and intimidating. Philip Seymour Hoffman, Elizabeth Banks, Donald Sutherland and Woody Harrelson are perfectly cast. The movie feels like a 'waiting room' for the grand finale. It is a good movie though.",6,3,15,26 November 2014
