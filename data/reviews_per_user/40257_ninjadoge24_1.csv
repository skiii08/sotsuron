10 Cloverfield Lane," A rip-off of The Divide minus the gore
","This movie was nothing like the original Cloverfield movie. For most parts it felt like a rip-off of The Divide - with a bunch of people trapped inside a bunker followed by the female protagonist causing everyone else to die either directly or indirectly and then getting out of the bunker to try and face the world on her own. The last 15 minutes were no doubt intense, but did not feel original either. This movie doesn't deserve to have the name 'Cloverfield' in the title. Replace it with something else and I don't think it will affect the story.The acting was good. The special effects and the aliens at the end of the movie were good. The suspense at some points was great. There was little to none character build up. The story was clichéd. The ending was greatly clichéd, felt dumb and doesn't leave you wanting for more.2/10. This movie lacked what the original Cloverfield movie offered. Would recommend watching only if you are new to this genre and haven't seen any other alien/post-apocalyptic sci-fi movies. If you are a fan of the prequel, this movie will leave you disappointed.",2,1,4,18 June 2016
