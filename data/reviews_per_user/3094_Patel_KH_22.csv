Sucker Punch," You will be unprepared for the effects and Zack's imagination
","Got the privilege of watching the Indian premiere of Sucker Punch yesterday and my excitement was through the roof (afterall, this is the guy who gave us 300 and Watchmen). What made the screening even more special was it was on IMAX screen. Yesterday was the first time I have ever been to a film premiere and I will remember this for a long time. Zack has done justice to his reputation. You will find plenty of his trademark slow-mo fight scenes and close ups. I can't talk more about the fights without revealing more, but I'm positive the first fight scene will take your breath away. What made the experience jaw dropping was the 'IMAX effect'. Try and catch this film on IMAX if you can, and I'm sure it will have leave a different impression on your mind than a conventional theatre would. It features an ensemble female cast, Emily Browning(Babydoll), Jena Malone(Rocket) and Abbie Cornish(Swea Pea) played their part well whereas Vanessa Hudgens(Blondie) and Jamie Chung(Amber) were a distraction at times. But I wasn't impressed with Oscar Isaac as Blue, maybe he tried too hard to be a memorable villain. The core of the film however is the other(fictional) world (this is where we see Zack's imagination in full flight). The visuals are amazing, set-pieces are jaw dropping and epic in every sense. In short, Sucker Punch is visually enthralling action fantasy that will blow you away. Well done Zack!",8,77,149,23 March 2011
Se7en," Great serial-killer drama...
","Brad Pitt and especially Morgan Freeman were wonderful in this film. The plot was intriguing and the background score was also good. But after seeing quite a number of films with shocking endings I have to say I saw it coming. But still its a great film. Considering it was made in 1995, David Fincher did a tremendous job in making a visually stunning film. Kevin Spacey who plays the diabolical yet misunderstood serial killer was awesome in every way you can imagine. Definitely one of the best murder-mystery drama out there. Inspired by the seven deadly sins, the film follows two Cops, one on the verge of retirement and the other newly transfered as they try to solve the mystery behind the serial killing of various unrelated people. If you like crime drama, this film is a MUST WATCH.8.3/10",8,0,0,17 July 2009
12 Angry Men," A film with 12 stars
","Let me start off by saying I couldn't expect anything more from a film than what '12 Angry Men' provided. I don't know how else to describe this film than by writing the following statement. '12 Angry Men' is immaculate, impeccable, flawless, perfect and astounding. Pardon me for writing these many superlatives but this film is a classic Masterpiece in the true sense of the word. I absolutely loved it! The movie has one of the most simple plots and only runs for an hour and 36 minutes. It is predominantly shot in a single room and its in Black and White{released way back in the year 1957}. So whats so great about this film you ask? Well to start with this film has 12 stars...Have you ever seen a film with more stars? Probably not. These 12 stars are none other than the 12 Jurors who have to decide a boy's fate. All they have to do is to vote whether the boy is GUILTY OR NOT? What follows is the greatest and maybe the longest conversation in a film I've ever seen. You won't believe how different and unique these 12 men are.Juror#1 : A guy who appears confused and tries to calm everyone else around him so that they can reach to a conclusive verdict. Juror#2 : A shy person who doesn't speak his mind but understands the situations.Juror#3 : A dominant personality who appears very firm and a successful businessman.Juror#4 : The most logical of all.Juror#5 : A young man from a violent slum who maybe understands the boy's situation the best.Juror#6 : A well built man, principled and respectful.Juror#7 : A sports fan who doesn't care much.Juror#8 : An architect who deeply thinks about the case.Juror#9 : {I liked all the characters but the most interesting was this one} A wise old man whose experience speaks for himself.Juror#10 : A foul mouthed and an aggressive person.Juror#11 : An immigrant watchmaker and a supporter for the justice.Juror#12 : An advertising executive who likes to be with the majority.As someone had commented before 'If you ever see only one Black and White film make it this one'...Rightly said. Kudos to that Guy. Will always remain in my Top Movies list. Go see it!9.9/10",10,0,0,28 July 2009
Pan's Labyrinth," Stunning piece of MAGIC...
","Awesome! This film comes straight from the director's heart. Exceptional screenplay, magical storyline, masterfully set up and visually jaw dropping. A great mix of innocence and brutality, fantasy and reality, together in a wonderful fairy tale about the power of magic in dark times. The little girl(Ivana Bacquero) was a revelation. Sergi Lopez did a great job. The ending stumped me...superb end to a great film. The violence is graphic and the monsters are scary but i thoroughly enjoyed the film. Definitely goes down as one of my all-time favourites. Everyone should see this film.WARNING:Graphic content may not be appropriate for children below 12 years.9.6/10",10,2,11,6 August 2009
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," My favourite and for some very good reasons...
","I will divide my review into following 5 categories each accounting a maximum of 100%(if perfect)________________________________________________________________ Visual Pleasure:[100%] Visually, this film is a monumental landmark. A dream film for every action-movie supporter. The futuristic scenes were classic for a film shot before 1991. And the present day scenes are no less epic. Especially the Truck-Chase scene (this in my mind is the single-most awesome action sequence in the history of film-making). We are treated to some of best action sequences EVER in the entire movie. T-1000 & T-101 face-offs will be cherished by me for the rest of my life. Director's Work:[100%] James Cameron needs no introduction. And this is probably his best work (he has done few of the best films so its no small statement). He weaves each and every scene so well that its truly magical and a viewer's delight.Acting:[100%] Wow! That about describes it. The best Arnold Schwarzenegger movie by miles. Edward Furlong's best movie (he was exceptional...no-one else would've been more appropriate). Robert Patrick's best movie. And above all Linda Hamilton's iconic role as Sarah Connor (Curse Oscar jury for not giving a well deserved Oscar to the greatest action female character of all-time:Sarah Connor).Entertainment Value:[100%] Perfect! Couldn't ASK for more. A high octane and thrilling ride throughout the movie. This is what I call COMPLETE SATISFACTION or in Hindi:'Paisa Vasool'.Script:[100%] Flawless. Some of the best one-liners EVER. A superb message:'It's in your nature to destroy yourselves'. The relationship between a Terminator(Arnold) and human(John) was awe-inspiring. There are endless things I can list down here but its better if you experience it.__________________________________________________________________ My Advice: A MUST-SEE for EVERY action-movie fan. This film will definitely pass the test of time. In General, if anyone is a normal movie-buff, you should see this...What am I saying?? I'm sure everyone must have seen this if not something's wrong with you. Its a classic. My all-time favourite movie (and i've seen many-many films including most of the olden classics). I adore this movie! _____ 10/10",10,4,5,9 July 2009
Spirited Away," It feels like you are Dreaming...
","This film is magical. Chihiro's journey was wonderful. A stupendous film where the director has taken the story telling to a whole new level. Animation is marvellous & the imaginative vision of the director is app-laudable. Hayao Miyazaki's direction is really impressive. The film runs for 2 hours but you never get a feeling of tiredness...in fact you want the mystical, enchanting journey of Chihiro to continue forever. I saw the English dubbed version and it was very satisfying. The background score also compliments the film very well. I'm glad i saw this film! Highly recommended. If possible check Miyazaki's other films, he is a master in anime making.9.6/10",10,1,2,6 August 2009
District 9," One of the very best this year{its been a mediocre year comparatively}...
","Incredible. Cant believe they made this film with a budget of $30 million. The entire backdrop and the CGI effects were simply unbelievable.This film is shot like a documentary. Big thumbs-up to Neill Blomkamp, he really put in a lot of efforts in this and it was quite visible.This film also shows some very gross looking aliens{never before seen design of the aliens}, who are stranded at Jo'burg of all places{finally we have a movie where the action isn't in the USA, GLAD} for 20 yrs because of some difficulties{I don't want to give away spoilers}.The film revolves around the alien habitation called District 9 and the subject of the film, Wikus van de Merwe. The film also shows some pretty brutal violence and it can make a few sick. For most of the time I was awestruck at the believable plot, characters and the high intensity of action. Superb directing and a great piece of story which I think can actually happen. I recommend this to everyone who can handle brutal violence. You have to enjoy this yourself.9.5/10",10,1,4,11 September 2009
Before Sunset," A love story with a difference...
","Damn it! I felt they cut short this film. Whenever we hear the word SEQUEL, it feels like a recipe for disaster...there are very few instances in this world where sequel was as good or better than the first movie.This movie is one of those few instances. Two words that describe this movie are- JUST GREAT. It was a pleasure to watch both the movies simultaneously one after the other.The Ending was truly fantastic, keeps the viewer guessing & gasping for more. I loved it & wanted to see more of the chemistry between Jesse and Celine. One more fact that is unbelievable is that there is no kissing scene.A romantic film without a single kiss & mostly based on the conversation between the actors makes you question how is it possible??...Well for the answer you have to see this movie. The scene in the van, where they finally unburden themselves. One of the most emotionally raw and honest interplays I've seen. The only possible flaw was they didn't show more places in Paris.9.3/10",9,3,5,13 August 2009
City of God," WoW!
","WOW! The movie was excellent but the story is truly SAD. Can you imagine how insane it is to shoot a running Chicken with a gun...It was CRAZY right from the opening scene. The actors did a tremendous job (never seemed like they were acting). I'm giving it 8 stars (instead of 10) because there was no positive message in the end...It was implied that the life of misery in the City of God would continue. Make no mistake- the movie is Great but at the same time TERRIFYING. I don't know if they could've made a more better movie than this, It had everything and was almost PERFECT. I would rate this :8.4/10",8,0,1,13 August 2009
Cars," One of my favourite PIXAR movie and it has Schumi in it
","Enjoyed & loved it. Pixar & Disney totally rock! I found it fascinating that cars could behave like humans and that the feelings of superiority and spite and the rest of it... Besides the lesson is really something: Glamour is not all, sometimes the smallest and prettiest things are the best. People who love cars like me should definitely watch this movie. A great experience...... Oh Yeah! Don't forget it has Michael Schumacher in a Cameo{one of the reasons why this film rocked for me}.Exactly my kind of movie wherein Cars are given more importance and refreshing to see.9.5/10",10,0,0,6 August 2009
Grave of the Fireflies," Depressing and sad but a great movie
","A great depressing story. A must see for those who can handle sad movies. It was a heart-wrenching experience for me. Long after i finished watching this 1hr 30min movie i still couldn't get off my mind the hardships faced by the people affected by the war. Especially children were the most affected. This film is very honest. The background score matched well with the emotional tones of the film. I watched the Eng-dubbed version and maybe that brought down the depressing tone a little but it was haunting enough. This is one of those very few films that reduced me to watery eyes. Once you see it you may never watch it again{I think I'll never see this again}...Easily one of the best Anime films and maybe one of the best movies that shows the true cost of the war. This is one of the GEMS out there, Don't miss out.WARNING: Be prepared for an emotional ride. 9.2/10",9,1,2,6 August 2009
The Dark Knight," Darker than its predecessor but watch out for The Joker
","This film is complete in all sense. The dialogues were breathtaking, action sequences(shot using IMAX cameras) were marvellous, good humor, great acting & everything you want to see in a movie. The Dark Knight Redefines the superhero movie genre and sets the bar to an almost unachievable height. Heath Ledger(Joker) was mind blowing & totally insane{The Academy did justice by handing over him the Oscar}. You have to admire & love him. This is definitely going down as one of my all-time favourite movie. JUST WATCH IT At least ONCE & JUDGE YOURSELF. I may not be the first to recommend this but i wont be the last... 9.7/10",10,2,5,6 August 2009
The Greatest Game Ever Played," Maybe this is one of the Greatest Sports movie EVER made...
",I will divide my review into following 5 categories each accounting a maximum of 100%(if perfect) ________________________________________________________________ Visual Pleasure:[100%] This is extremely pleasing movie visually. I had a great time watching it. Golfing scenes are very well shot and the dramatic effects on the green were quite amazing. I also loved seeing the old wooden golf clubs and the bag.Director's Work:[70%] Bill Paxton is more associated to acting but this film shows he's got talent. Did a decent job.Acting:[90%] Shia LeBeouf was very good in his role of Francis Ouimet(this guy can ACT well). The rest of the cast was also good.Entertainment Value:[100%] I enjoyed every minute of it. It was overwhelmingly entertaining.Script:[91%] Based on a true story and therefore it makes the film that much more special. It was intriguing right from the start and loved every scene till the very end.__________________________________________________________________ My Advice: Definitely a MUST watch for all the Sports lovers especially Golf(You all will love it). Anyone who is looking for a nice entertaining movie and doesn't hate Sports can watch it. _____ 10/10,10,6,8,8 July 2009
Avatar," Experience that is worth every penny...
","More than a decade after his record breaking blockbuster Titanic, James Cameroon is back with Avatar!When I first saw the trailer, the name 'James Cameroon'{after all he directed my favourite movie ever - Terminator 2} was enough for me to get excited and though the trailer was decent I was a bit skeptical regarding the acting of Zoe Saldana {she looked a little cocky in the trailer and the dialogue delivery seemed poor} but I'm glad the film turned out to be very good and most of the actors did a good job.Avatar is not a film but a breath taking visual experience. The creative imagination of James Cameroon is so spectacular that it can't be described in words and would me more appropriate if you yourself experience the astonishing forests of Pandora. I expected to visualize a new world with extraordinary creatures {creatures of Pandora were truly amazing, some of them are etched in my memory}, new language and decent script. I got what I expected. The background music/sound effects are also pretty solid. 3D just adds to the viewing pleasure.People may complain there was no character development, stereotyped characters, clichéd story, plot holes, weak dialogue{I agree with this up to a certain extent} etc. BUT I say just sit back, relax and let the director take you on an unforgettable journey.Will it revolutionize cinema? Can't say,it probably won't but that doesn't take anything away from this masterpiece. Are the special effects worth the hype? You betcha, CGI is flat-out AMAZING. Is it worth the time and money? Yes, its worth every penny.I saw this in 3D at Imax but 3D or 2D this film should not be missed.",8,1,3,24 December 2009
Groundhog Day," This film will make your Day!
","Wow! This movie was very very good. It is more funny and clever than you would think. A nice story about a selfish reporter with the Channel 9 and how one day, 'Groundhog Day' changes his life forever. The characters and the entire set-up was really good. Bill Murray as Phil Connors was terrific and his personality change was totally convincing. This film entertains, makes you laugh, but above all the fun you have while watching this, it makes you think about the person you want to be and what you are. Actually it teaches you, 'How to be a better Human-being?' The supporting cast including the pretty Andie MacDowell were all very good. Truly a feel good movie. Everyone should enjoy this.All in all a nice film that will make your day...It certainly made mine.9.4/10",9,2,5,29 July 2009
Reservoir Dogs," Almost Perfect casting and a good film
","I must admit Tarantino has his own unique style of making films and this film is no exception. I'm still not a fan of his work but I liked this film. I've tried watching Pulp Fiction a couple of times but I could only manage a maximum of 45 minutes into that film...Lets just say Pulp Fiction is not my cup of tea, who knows maybe third time I'll see it completely and then decide for myself. So before watching this film I was a little skeptical about the quality of the film-making from Tarantino. As it turned out he did a very good job. I was pleased with the movie and I believe it was never off-track. Probably the best thing other than the plot and the characters was the casting. Kudos to the man behind the casting he was almost spot-on. Now that brings me to the point where I felt a little let down. Chris Penn as 'Nice Guy Eddie' was a DOUCHE BAG. I absolutely hated his acting especially during the Mexican Standoff scene when he yelled at Mr.White and while asking Mr.Orange for the answers{Chris was trying to bulge his eyes out}...That looked damn Phony and unrealistic. That scene really bothered me. The other not so good thing about the movie IMO was its profanity{especially the ear-cutting scene...it was gross}. Everything else was very good.Due to these reasons I give this film a 8.0/10",8,0,0,28 July 2009
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Box-office BLOCKBUSTER, riding on cool CGI effects...
","I will divide my review into following 5 categories each accounting a maximum of 100%(if perfect)________________________________________________________________ Visual Pleasure:[76%] There were basically 2 reasons I saw this, first being the fighting scenes between the Transformers and second being Megan Fox. My first wish was fulfilled, there's a lot of action and I love that (the best sequence was the one where Optimus Prime fights Megatron, Starscream and Grindor...superb). For some reason I felt Megan was portrayed much better in the first film. The reason I cut 24% is because they showed these Robots as sex machines (that was insulting...Wheelie & Devastator disgusted me).Director's Work:[10%] This guy is a little crazy. Someone should tell him to stop filling the films with his crappy humor. I really don't know what his job requirements are since the cool-CGI stuff is not his responsibility, he's pretty much useless or maybe there is something for him...lets see: shout ACTION, CUT and PACK-UP.Acting:[20%] Come on people we are talking about Transformers (particularly not famous for its acting). IMO the best actor was Optimus Prime.Entertainment Value:[74%] Its 74% entertaining and most of that 74% is because of the cool CGI-effects. As all of you know, seeing Davastator and the Autobots (excluding the Twins), Decepticons in action was cool.Script:[12%] The only thing that comes close to the bad direction is the Script. The Twins were Stupid and irritating to say the least (I don't know why they were given so much attention and screen time...they never looked heroic to me). Quite a few scenes were really unwanted. I hope they seriously prepare a good script for the next one (if there is one...looking at the box office numbers, there will be a Transformers 3).__________________________________________________________________ All the people who LOVED the first film should LIKE this. Anyone who's looking for a time-pass film can watch this. I saw this movie on the first day, first show for Rs.50 (around US$ 1 ...matinee show) and I don't feel cheated. My advice is watch this one at a theater with cheap ticket-price (if possible) and you won't regret it. Some cool CGI stuff waiting for you. _____ 5.3/10",5,0,4,10 July 2009
The Green Mile," A real Masterpiece...
","From the director of 'The Shawshank Redemption' {Frank Darabont} comes another masterpiece 'The Green Mile'. I absolutely loved it. Everything about this film stands out, be it acting, directing, cinematography and above all the story {adapted from the novel by Stephen King}. This film made me feel for the characters. I don't shed a tear watching a movie often but this made me cry pretty bad, it was that moving. With over 3 hrs you would think it was boring but believe me you won't move while watching. I can't gather enough superlatives to describe this movie. The dialogue in this film was simple yet deeply penetrating. Also has one of the best finishing lines EVER, 'But, oh, God...sometimes...the Green Mile seems so long.'{As someone said: A gift is not always a blessing} It was mesmerising, powerful, beautiful, brilliant and miraculous at the same time. It doesn't get better than this. I liked it more than 'Shawshank'...Now that says something since 'Shawshank' is in my Top 5 list. This will remain one of my all-time favourites for a long time. Highly recommended.9.9/10",10,1,2,17 July 2009
The Shawshank Redemption," Shawshank never won best pictureÂ… one of the greatest crimes at the Oscars in History
","I was literally HOOKED. No wonder this film is rated amongst the best ever. This is definitely one of the best movies you will see your entire life. Morgan Freeman's narration was awesome. Tim Robbins powerfully illustrates the importance of HOPE. All the characters did a superb job. This is surely one of my all time favourite movies. Its a classic & a true masterpiece of cinema... Don't think! Just watch & savour it.I saw the following comment by someone and thought of adding it to mine, I agree 100% to everything of the following: 'Many people in this world are unhappy. Most people in this world don't want to be unhappy. Lots of people wish, pray and above all hope for that magic wand to wave and wash them of their fears, losses, angers and pains once and for all. They see lots of other people seemingly in this magical state, while they suffer. To borrow the words of another film, they're watching the bluebirds flying over the rainbow. Many unhappy people have learned that the magic wand doesn't exist. They're not destined to join the bluebirds and fairy tales don't come true. It's not that no one lives happily ever after, it's just that they're not going to. They're busy dying.In this film, or as some people have quite correctly said, this fairytale, magic wands exist. And that magic wand is Andy Dufrense imitating Houdini. However this film is not about him. Neither is it about the prison, the governor, the guard, the plot, the acting, the cinematography, the script, the direction or the score. It's about Red. He is the one who has become institutionally unhappy, he's not only trapped in a prison, not only has he given up on the idea of ever leaving, not only does he have no hope, he knows that if the miracle would ever happen to him, he couldn't cope. He's safe in his unhappiness and that security is what keeps him going. Hope is, as Red say, dangerous. The metaphor for a certain illness here is very clear to me and I know that a rather large number of people suffer from it. A large proportion of those don't understand what's wrong, but they certainly can recognise a fellow sufferer. Those who are mercifully untouched by this illness definitely don't understand what's going on in those who do. They're too busy living.'Just a little piece of advice to everyone who hated/disliked this film; Believe me this film is made for multiple viewings...Don't hate this after viewing it once or twice, give it at least more than 2 viewings before you make up your mind. I'm POSITIVE it will become more and more better after each viewing and probably you will end up loving it. If not, maybe it was just not your Cup Of Tea. I hope this film satisfies everyone and I really don't care if its No.1 on the IMDb or outside Top250. Its not fair to hate a film because your favourite is not above it in the rankings!Its a deeply satisfying movie that makes you understand the importance of HOPE.9.8/10P.S. Technically{all round film-making} it may not be the greatest movie of all-time{that honor can go to Godfather/LOTR:ROTK/Star Wars 4,etc.} BUT it certainly goes down in my book as one of the finest and a movie to savour for ages.",10,2,3,6 August 2009
Blade Runner," Science fiction brought to life...
","Is this a good day or what, got the pleasure of seeing two science fiction films today and both are superb. First Serenity and now this.Ridley Scott has done an amazing job here. To follow 'Alien' with 'Blade Runner' is almost too good. I instantly became the fan of 'Alien' and the way the future is shown there. 'Blade Runner' gives a human touch to the future {not the same one, obviously}.Harrison Ford prospered in the character of Deckard. The entire ambiance is shown well, Kudos to everyone involved...wouldn't be easy to do that in 1982. I doubt if this film will stand the test of time though!'Sean Young almost too beautiful to believe in this...', some one said this and rightly so. One thing that I disliked was the ending or to be precise...the last few scenes, they appeared ODD to me, can't exactly tell why but certainly weird.A unique visual experience that brings science fiction to life. Cinematography is applaudable. I enjoyed this.---------8.1/10",8,2,6,13 October 2009
Toy Story 3," Complete satisfaction
","Toy Story 3 is an adventure filled, entertaining and deeply emotional film for all ages. Toy Story was the beginning of PIXAR's extraordinary journey and they have delivered with just about every film since. The only question in my mind before seeing this film was 'Will it live up to the lofty standards of the first two films?'. Toy Story and Toy Story 2 were great in their own right but this film outclassed them both. The start was subtle, we see Andy playing with his toys as usual but something has changed. Then we embark on a journey with all the toys, again as usual. At this point the movie was only good but in the second half it just takes off. Can't say more without spoiling it. It has to be experienced. And the best part comes last, the ending of this movie gave me utmost satisfaction. What an end to the best trilogy of all time (atleast in my opinion) and Toy Story will remain the best trilogy unless Batman 3 proves otherwise. This film will made me laugh, jump with excitement and cry...thats right, the last 5-7 minutes were so moving that I shed a few tears. If you are wondering how can adults cry over toys, go see this. The wizards at PIXAR have delivered a masterpiece once again. The bar cannot be raised higher. Toy Story 3 is now officially my favourite animated feature film along with 'Spirited Away'.P.S. Kudos to PIXAR for 'Day & Night'(short film screened before Toy Story 3), it was simple yet amazing.",10,3,4,1 July 2010
Goodfellas," Too HIGH on IMDb charts for my liking!
","I will divide my review into following 5 categories each accounting a maximum of 100%(if perfect) ________________________________________________________________ Visual Pleasure:[75%] This is a classic mobster movie. I've seen quite a few mobster movies including all-time greats like Godfather 1,2; but i've never been visually pleased with them. They are all smooth but none of them visually stun me.Director's Work:[100%] Martin Scorsese is a legend. I feel everything he does is flawless. With this film again he has done an exceptional job. Any director couldn't have done anything more to make this film better.Acting:[100%] This is the best part of the movie. Every actor fits into his/her role perfectly. The execution and the dialogue delivery from all the actors was truly remarkable.Entertainment Value:[71%] This is the thing that let me down. I wasn't fully entertained by this movie and this factor contributes a lot in my rating. Sure there were some parts that I liked a lot but not as a whole. Maybe people who love Gangster movies will like it a lot more than I did.Script:[90%] The script was again very good. The narration and screenplay was also impressive.__________________________________________________________________ My Advice: People who loved Godfather will love this one. Anyone out there looking for a well-acted and a well-directed film, this one is for you._____ 7.4/10",7,1,3,9 July 2009
