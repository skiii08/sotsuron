The Blair Witch Project," Midsommer murders is more exciting to be honest
","I found it pretty boring to be honest. I couldn't quite see why they used a black and white camera as well as a normal colour video camera as all it seemed to do was make it harder to understand what was going on. The plot is pretty basic and they didn't really seem to bother with suspense at all. I can understand that it is good for the budget and number of people involved in the project but I simply don't think its worth buying or renting because its not that good a film. As I said in the summary, Midsommer murders, a British TV crime production, is more scary which isn't saying all that much as it is more scary than a lot of horror. Still maybe I'm being a bit harsh. The acting is good and the characters feel like real people even if they still aren't the brightest of people. I give it 8 stars for the budget, 3 for the overall effect and as a total rounding up rating I'll give it 5 stars",5,1,4,14 September 2005
