Vertigo," Great Acting and Thills + Hitchcock= What Might Be the Best Picture Caught On Film
","This movie is just breathtaking with all its visuals and its aura is
just amazing. The cinematography and of course the directing and
impeccable acting is just many of the ingredients to Hitchcock's
masterpiece. It is undoubtedly his best work, and is a cinematic
masterpiece to this day, it is one of the best pictures caught on film,
so pure and enigmatic to film history, it flows like good wine. Anyone
who doesn't agree doesn't understand film at all, or is just one-sided
or biased against this film. THe only way this film should ever be
remade is if Hitchcock rises from the grave to direct it himself,
otherwise it should never be touched or ruined, and left alone as the
masterpiece it is. This is a masterpiece through all cinema's history,
so hopefully Hollywood will get the point, and not touch it. Some
movies need to be remade, but this is not one of them.",10,21,29,22 January 2006

Citizen Kane," This IsThe Most Important Film Ever Made, And Here's Why
","Arguably the greatest of American films, Orson Welles's 1941 masterpiece, made when he was only 26. Plot: Citizen Kane still unfurls like a dream and carries the viewer along the mysterious currents of time and memory to reach a mature (if ambiguous) conclusion: people are the sum of their contradictions, and can't be known easily. Welles plays newspaper magnate Charles Foster Kane, taken from his mother as a boy and made the ward of a rich industrialist. The result is that every well-meaning or tyrannical or self-destructive move he makes for the rest of his life appears in some way to be a reaction to that deeply wounding event. And in the end when everyone suspects that 'Rosebud' is something Kane wanted and never had, or something he had lost along with everything else, the irony is there, as they give up by saying that a man's life cannot be described in one word. Even though 'Rosebud' is the very name of the sleigh he had as a boy when he lived with his mother as a boy, and is the only thing he took with him, 'Rosebud' was always in his mind reminding of the event as he made moves through his life that would react to this deeply wounding event. And the scene of the men burning 'Rosebud' in the fire is breathtraking, leading you to the conclusion that the answer they were looking for to Kane's life was right there but destroyed by choice as it was for Kane. THe movie is breathtaking and may not be or be the best movie in history, it's your choice, i personally think that it is at the top, if not, the top. But I personally love Vertigo, read my review for Vertigo also, it has so many ingredients to project what we call the best picture in cinematic history, while Citizen Kane falls short to me, somewhere, although I can't place my finger on it and what it's missing. I think it's just the genre and how Vertigo's thrilling aspects interest me, but this is undoubtedly the most important film in all of history, rent, or better yet, buy the two-disc set, featuring an amazing documentary on disc two, which was nominated in 1995, for best documentary, by the Academy. And then you will understand this review completely, thank you.",10,1,3,22 January 2006
Cloverfield," I Thought It Was Great
","I went to see this movie at 12:01 A.M. on Friday morning, the first show, and thought the movie was great. Althoguh I will tell you that if you get motion sickness or easy headaches DO NOT see this film, and if you do move as far away from the screen as possible! My friend got a bad headache and we were halfway up in the biggest theater in at the place which probably holds about 300-400 people. I was not affected because I would just close my eyes for a moment if I felt like it was a lot of moving and it would help my eyes a lot. But I went into this film with no real knowledge of the film and no expectations. The marketing of this film was brilliant, and I believe they delivered a very good film with it! Now people are coming out and saying there was no plot or back story, and felt it was hard to relate or understand the characters, but what people aren't getting is that Cloverfield isn't supposed to be that kind of film. It is a film that we are supposed to watch as if we basically found or were shown footage from an attack on NYC by an unknown creature! I thought the film was effective and I truly felt as if I was with the characters while this all was happening and experiencing it with them, so it's not supposed to be a film with character development or a real plot or explanation. The film feels eerily similar to watching a 9/11 footage video, and when you watch those you feel for the people but don't need or expect a plot about them. Don't get me wrong their is a story within the film, but I'll just leave it at that. I thought the film was very innovative and almost ground breaking in the way it was shot and the feel you get from it! Great Job!",10,36,70,18 January 2008
