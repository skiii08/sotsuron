The Legend of Bagger Vance," Awesome Movie and not just a chic flick
","It has been several years since this movie came out and I watch it at least three to four times a year. This movie just touches a nerve about life and how we sometimes get lost and need to find our way back. I think this movie represents that. It is also just a great story with a hero and we need hero's. I never understood why movie reviewers or the media consider this movie a 'mistake' for Matt Damon, Charlieze Theron and Will Smith. It is an awesomely made movie with excellent acting and a really good story!! If that isn't what movie making is all about I don't know what is. This is a great Robert Redford directed movie with great characters and a good story. The cinematography is excellent and Jack Lennon character is one of the bests.",10,0,2,18 December 2007
