The New World," What movies can aspire to be
","I brought some of my remembrance's of Virginia with me into this film. I love Virginia with its even seasons, beautiful land and waters. So, when I saw the film, I could really feel the scene. I love the use of ambient sound. This is a beautiful movie. I have always loved Eric Horner's scores. The love story, the discovery, the encounters of different cultures. The pace and balance of the movie was good, and not slow. The character of Pocahontas was not only well played, but the substance of her story was beautiful and brought me to tears several times. It was an Oscar performance if ever there was a place of honor for acting. Yes, this is a movie I have enjoyed more than any in recent memory. I don't expect everyone to 'get it', and that is OK. But I think everyone needs to see this movie because it is what movies can aspire to be. Its the unsaid, but seen and the listened to.",10,3,7,15 May 2006
