The Blair Witch Project," Daringly Original....Extremely Terrifying
","The Blair Witch Project, set an example for many movies to come.  With a budget of only 36000, this film was able to create a horrifying film.  This proves that money and special effects don't make the movie.  The Blair Witch Project is a story of three filmmakers, who are creating a documentary.  As their curiosity thickens, however, they find themselves lost in the forest of the Blair Witch.  Over the next few days, they realize that they may never find their way back, and gradually their optimism disappears.  The amazing part about this movie is how they are able to frighten you without even showing the Blair Witch, or having the villain pop out and scare you. In this film, the terror builds up gradually, instead of very quickly, and allows the fear within you build intensity.  The final scene of this film, to me is an interesting outcome, but I will leave you in suspense.Original, and very scary.........*******(7 stars of 10).",7,0,1,29 September 1999
The Red Violin," A Beautifully intertwined story
","The Red Violin is a beautifully intertwined story following one very special violin throughout history.  From Italy, to Germany, to England, to China and finally ending up at an auction in Montreal, this is a film that had me touched the whole time.  The narrative in this film is very special as well, as it is told by an Italian psychic, reading a pregnant woman the future of this red violin.  With each new home, this violin seems to tell a new story. And in the end, each place it has been has come to claim it back.  The end is a great twist to the movie and I will let you find that out yourself. *********(9 stars)",8,0,0,23 July 1999
