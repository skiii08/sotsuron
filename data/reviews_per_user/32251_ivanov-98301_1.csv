Child 44," set of old dusted stamps...
","Since Dumas went to Russia and wrote about many things, like 'broad spreading cranberry tree', he had established trend which is very alive even now. I am far away from being another protector of 'soviet values' as you saw in many previous comments. But - do not call it 'historical', please, please. The movie does not fit in so many angles, from clothes to houses and so on, so on. Plus, the original book and following script made by people who had no freaking idea how militia and KGB had worked in USSR. All these things in the movie looks like a bad joke. How many millions they have spend for this? 50 mil? Why do not interview some of alive witnesses of these times? Some people said 'the movie failed to deliver the great story'. I am sorry, but story is plainly bad too. Probably this is a one of major reason why this movie failed.",3,23,43,16 May 2015
