","This is the Best Bond Movie ! 10/10!! I shed a tear as to how good it was ! Finally a Bond Movie that explains more about James Bond,,his background and who the hell is this 007 where he comes from his mind his life his back-story. There is so much i want to say about this film but can't as it may spoil some of the greatness in watching it ! Decide for yourself of course as art is art but besides the bond fans out there I think anyone who loves a good story and a great piece of film making will enjoy this. For me when a film ends i either think good glad it's over or i will just sit there and think wow..i want more. When we finish a great book there is the same feeling that you don't want it to end you want to stay,,this movie had that effect on me like no movie has in years.I actually am sitting here right now melting through another Perth heatwave and am on a natural high that the film industry hasn't given me for years. Thank you James Bond Thank you Judy Dench (who should win an Oscar for this film) 10/10 Skyfall is a slow starter but a huge finisher. Perfect Bond ,,I hope you all enjoy this film as it is a great movie too not just another Bond film.Pleasure ! Joy ! Perfect !",10,6,14,31 December 2012
