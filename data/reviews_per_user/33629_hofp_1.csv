Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," This is no regular movie, it's a Star Wars movie.
","I believe that The Phantom Menace has lived up to any expectations the original Star Wars movies have set forth.  The cast puts on an overwhelming performance, and George Lucas succeeds wonderfully at creating enchanting and visually stunning new Star Wars worlds.  I was absolutely mesmorized by the exceedingly beautiful Natalie Portman in her role as PadmÃ© and as Queen Amidala.  When you watch this movie as a Star Wars fan since you were 8 years of age, it's super exciting to hear people on the big screen talk about 'Skywalker' and not see Luke in the picture.  And also, meeting Luke and Leia's grandmother was pretty neat.  You don't have to be a fan to love this movie though.  The Phantom Menace has converted anti-Star Wars people into true fans.",10,0,0,22 May 1999
