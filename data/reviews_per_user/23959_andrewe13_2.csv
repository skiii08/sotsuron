The Ring," i've seen better.
","this movie is like a mix of sixth sense and the others w/ all the twists its got.  this movie will leave you with too many unanswered questions.  Not a bad movie, but a little corny.  only the beginning and the end are the good, so while the boring part in the middle plays when u see it, go out and do something, and come back for the end.  :)",Null,0,0,11 January 2003
Final Destination 2," Corny with a capital C.
","they coulda made this movie better, by not making it.  they shoulda just stuck with FD1, because there was no point in this one.  its not a bad movie, but its corny.  by the middle of the film, you know what will happen, its almost repetitivly anoying.  the death scenes are kinda disgusting, but they acted them pretty well.  not for the 'skweemish'.  I saw this movie January 25 before the release date.  go see FD1 instead if u havn't, or see a different movie.",6,1,1,25 January 2003
