The Devil's Advocate," An Angel Heart for the new Millennium
","I was put off of seeing this movie it when it first came out because:- (a) I'm not (normally) a Reeves fan (b) I am a Pacino fan but for some reason I expected his performance to be 'low-key' - perhaps a Michael Corleone great grandfather type figure - all restraint and quiet reflection. (c) I hate (most) courtroom drama moviesI saw the movie on video last night and was...... very pleasantly surprised. Reeves was pretty good - 100% believable in the role.  Every member of the supporting cast were fantastic and Pacino was excellent but in a very unconventional, unlikeable way.  His John Milton seemed, at turns, to (deliberately I think) parody his Godfather, Scarface and even Scent of a Woman characters.  One of my favourite movies of all time is Angel Heart. This movie is the only thing that has even come close to reaching the same sinister/inward-spiraling/reality-bluring atmosphere of that earlier movie. There was so much about TDA that was impressive.  Sure, the ending was (somewhat) predictable but the way in which it was resolved was extremely imaginative and thought provoking.  I was glad that the sfx were not allowed to 'take over' the movie which is a common failing in these CGI-prevalent times.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes intelligent, chilling movies.  One last point: Shouldn't the Rolling Stones fadeout track have been 'Sympathy for the Devil'?",Null,1,2,7 February 1999

","oh dear, oh dear, oh dear...this movie started off pretty good.  the pre-opening titles scenes were great and really built up the old anticipation levels. the title sequence itself was rubbish - Johnny Cash for christ sakes !?! after that it got rubbish very quickly. at about the appearance of 'stereotypical shaved-headed black guy no. 2', i realised that in fact this was going to be a cliched, MTV-generation non-event movie after all.  damn shame too. the scariest thing about this movie?  Tom Savini - he looks EXACTLY the same as he did in the original DotD.  that's 25 years old - is Tom actually undead or something? Last word - the soundtrack is absolutely pitiful.  some really poor tracks were layered over this movie.  WHY !?!?!?! please, please, please, when in another 25 years someone makes another remake of this film, can they put some effort into it and make it GOOD !?!",Null,0,0,6 April 2004

","This movie was absolute garbage. A crash course in trashy film-making for vacuous idiots. 'Hey dude, that was, like, one awesome movie...' - - - yeah, right! Get a life dick-brain. Tarantino is a shite film-maker. His whole career is 75% ripped-off Asian movies and little-seen US heist/noir movies plus 25% vanity projects that have been hyped on the 'strength' of his name. That he gives this celluloid tripe his 'mark of quality' says it all. If you want Roth, Tarantino and any other 'up-and-coming' 'Tarantinoesque film-makers' (HA HA! - what an oxymoron that is!) to stop churning out moronic dross like this, there's only one course of action. Avoid it like the plague.",1,2,4,7 August 2006
