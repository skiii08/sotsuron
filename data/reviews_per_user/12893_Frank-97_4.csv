3:10 to Yuma," Excellent movie until the end - the original film was better
","***********SPOILERS****************I thoroughly enjoyed this remake, despite some over the top excesses, but the ending spoiled it for me. The actions just made no sense. While I understand that Ben Wade had come to respect Dan Evans a great deal, it still made no sense for him to then murder his own men for saving his life by killing Dan. Just too far fetched! I saw the remake two nights ago and the original last night. While there is much I liked and admired in the remake, as I said, I thought the ending made very little sense. I was very curious to see how the original ended...as it turns out it was COMPLETELY different and to my mind much better and more logical.In the original, Dan does not get shot, so of course Ben Wade does not shoot his own men (totally nonsensical in the remake!). BOTH men jump on the train and escape the ambush by Wade's men. When Dan asks Wade why he not only saved him but got on the train to the prison with him, Wade said that he didn't like owing anything to anybody. Dan had saved his life (earlier in the original film) and so now they were even...besides 'I've escaped from Yuma prison before anyway!' This ending made infinitely more sense to me than the remake...it is a shame they changed it so much.",6,4,7,29 February 2008
John Wick," Booooooring!!!
","WOW! This movie was a monumental bore! The 'story' would barely make two pages of text. Former assassin retires, marries the girl of his dreams. He inherits her adorable little dog. Thugs teal his car and murder his dog. John Wick decides to kill lots of people involved.Shoots up clubs in NYC where dozens of people are gunned down. Does the NYPD make even a token appearance? NAHHH! Simply put, this movie was stupefyingly boring!It is hard to know what else to say about a movie that has so little substance. Quite frankly, the movie simply became silly, but not in a good sense...it just dragged on and on and on....",2,5,9,23 January 2016
Crash," AWFUL Hollywood claptrap
","I believe this is without doubt the WORST movie ever to win Best Picture. Previously I handed that to either Rocky (because its competition of All The President's Men, Network, Taxi driver and Bound for Glory were all far superior) or Shakespeare In Love (Saving Private Ryan was INFINITELY better). Crash though does not deserve any sort of consideration at all. It is smug, pretentious and has more ridiculous and heavy handed plot twists than any major movie I ever saw.*SPOILER* Example: Two cops stop a car driven by a black couple. The bigoted white cop proceeds to fondle the woman as he 'frisks' her as the husband asks politely to be allowed to go with just a warning. The cop lets them go. His partner is repulsed and asks for a transfer. Later on the bigoted cop rescues the very same woman from a car wreck nanoseconds before the car explodes. Still later the partner picks up a black hitch hiker and then gets angry at him presumably for laughing at him. The black man protests that he was not laughing at him and for some reason digs in his pocket. The 'good' cop tells him to take his hand from his pocket. When the black man doesn't do it fast enough the cop shoots and kills him only to discover the black man was reaching not for a gun but for a St. Christopher medal! PUH-LEEZE! Stupid ridiculous garbage made worse because it lured me in with a very promising first third that proceeded to go quickly and steadily downhill. The type of movie that Hollywood sorts love because they think it shows 'real life'...Drivel",1,3,8,14 February 2007
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Stupid and pointless
",No plot...no story at all to speak of...just non-stop cartoon violence.  The blood spurting from severed limbs ad infinitum reminded me of Monty Python's Black Knight in the Holy Grail.  I found this movie to be a monumental waste of time and boring as hell!  Leave your brain at the door! Far too many talented people were involved in this for the end result to be so pointless.,3,5,9,13 October 2003
