The Expendables 2," This movie is a steaming pile
","From the beginning bad guys die. They die with a lovely array of red goo cascading from their bodies. They die in a plume of red mist. They die, constantly. Our heroes just keep plugging them full of bullets and the action never stops; while the suspense never builds.There is a young whippersnapper named 'Billy' who was not in the first movie. You can guess what happens to such an idealistic young man who is the only one in the group with something to lose. I think this movie was written by an eighth grader with a book of clich√©s doing most of the work for him. The only thing missing from this desensitizing bloodbath were naked ladies.Somehow old guys with guns keep showing up and saving the day at just the right moment. Chuck Norris has the lamest role in the whole film and doesn't even roundhouse, or backfist, one person. Arnold only says what he has said in every other film he has ever been in. Stallone mumbles unintelligibly throughout. Statham has so many knives hidden in his coat you'd think he was a Cutco salesman. You only get one scene with Jet Li before he disappears without explanation for the rest of the film.This movie sucks. Hard. Couple this with the soundtrack which has two orchestras playing the score. One is a competent Hollywood symphony playing the notes that were written, while simultaneously a group of middle schoolers in beginning band try their best to play off key. It is really painful to listen to.Van Damme gets to show that he can act, but only for one scene before he goes the way of the rest.In the end they win. But we all lose.",2,1,2,29 November 2012
