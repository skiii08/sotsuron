Catch Me If You Can," Catch The Book First ... If You Can
","Catch Me If You Can is a great movie.  The atmosphere, the acting, the sets, the costumes, the music, ... all contribute to a very stylish and interesting film.  The only problem this movie has is that it's linked to one of the best books I have ever read.  The book is so much more exciting and thrilling than the movie.  I know, it's the same old story, 'the book is better than the movie', but in this case I feel that the screenwritter left out the most exciting parts of the novel and added way too much stuff that was only brievely mentioned in the book.  When the book starts, the mother is long gone and Frank's relationship with his father is maybe one page long. The movie also doesn't stress enough how after years of conning and living a luxurious life, Frank retires in France where he ends up arrested by interpol and ends in up in a French nightmare of a prison.  I could go on and on how great the book was and how I would go 'wooooooooow' each time I turned a page.  A wow effect I was missing in the film.  So Catch the book first if you can, if not, enjoy the film for what it is ... and read the book after you step out of the theater!",Null,0,1,3 January 2003
Lost in Translation," Lost in Total Boredom
","For quite some time I had told myself that I wanted to see Lost in Translation.  The film was re-released in the theaters due to the upcoming Oscars and at the same time, was available on DVD at the local Blockbuster.  I decided to go with the latter and rented it. Damn, was I happy I only spent $4.00 instead of the $10.00 admission ticket!!!!  Why this film is getting such a hype and why critics are praising it like its the best film in years is beyond me.  At first, I kind of enjoyed it.  Two Americans stuck in Tokyo, not understanding a word of Japanese and starting a friendship was a good start for a film. And then I waited,  And waited some more.  And I kept on waiting for something to happen.  Anything!  I was hoping those two boring, flat and depressing characters would get out of their expensive hotelroom and start an adventure in this crazy Japanese city that is Tokyo.  But no.  They hang around in the bar, jump in the pool, look at the city from their hotel room window, go back to the bar, have another dip in the pool, go back to their room, where they look even more depressed than they already were... Okay, are we still awake?  Well, considering they were having problems sleeping, they should have done the same like me: rent this overrated masterpiece.  They would have fallen asleep in no time!",Null,0,0,9 February 2004
Little Miss Sunshine," The best movie of the year ... so far!
","I just saw this movie last night and I'm still enjoying it! I had no idea what 'Little Miss Sunshine' was about. I had only seen one trailer, which basically consisted of one of the early scenes from the movie, when Steve Carell's character explains to Olive, why he tried to commit suicide. That scene was so funny that I didn't care what the movie was about, I just had to see it. Everything about this simple story of a little girl that dreams to be in a beauty pageant, and therefor drags her whole family on a road-trip from Alburquerque, New Mexico to Redondo Beach, California, is perfect. The writing was incredible, the dialog was clever and every character was so well defined that there really wasn't one single main character. The acting was amazing! I was so impressed with every single one of these actors, but the one that really blew me away was Abigail Breslin. Dakota Fanning watch your back! This little girl acted so natural that you never ever felt she was acting. One good example is the scene in which Olive (Abigail) asks her grandfather (Alan Arkin) if he thinks she is ugly. This scene was so moving that it could have easily ended-up being a very sappy and cheesy one. But the acting chemistry between Breslin and Arkin was so amazing that this is one of the best scenes in the movie. Wow, I loved this movie so much. Can't wait for the DVD to come out. I have to have this film in my collection.",10,4,9,12 August 2006
