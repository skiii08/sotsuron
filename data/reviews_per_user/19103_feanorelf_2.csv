Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Entertaining and disappointing
","I liked the first Sherlock Holmes a lot: the pace was good, the acting too and the chemistry between Holmes and Watson excellent. Quite an arbitrary reinvention of the character, but an enjoyable one: I appreciated that psychopathic facet of Holmes taken to paradox and the injection of fun and action. Yet it was still Sherlock Holmes, the genial detective, whose logic skills are beyond human. In the second movie one can find all the good ingredients of the first, but Sherlock Holmes: now that he has found his match and his nemesis, one would expect the main game to be played on the court of cleverness, one would want to assist a titanic chess game between the genius of investigation and the genius of crime, a sequence of formidable moves and counter-moves leading to plot twists one after the other. In truth, there is nothing of this: lots of speaking of cat and mouse games, but no cats, no mice and no game. It's not even worth to post spoilers... everything is so predictable.",6,1,1,9 January 2012
Alien vs. Predator," Predators genetic regression?
","As an Italian, let me apologize for having exported such a weird wax-statue of an actor as Raul Bova: fortunately the movie is so bad, that Bova is not its worst part.Others have written about how bad it is and why it is so bad, so let me just spend some words solidarity with Predators, for the sad evolution of their race.On the first movie - let aside the strange flawness of the Predator technology, preventing them from seeing anything covered by a layer of sh.. - it took a full-size Schwarzy, and a good amount of luck, to kill a Predator (and, anyway, after it had slaughtered a bunch of guerrillas, mercenaries and Apollo Creed, all armed to the teeth).Sadly on the second movie a Danny Glover, appareantly fully recovered from the finding of a bomb in his W.C., was more than enough for them. We also discover that even Predators have a should, and don't kill pregnant polices (of course, unless their fetus is covered with sh..).Eventually this movie, after promising us the fight between the best hunter and the fiercest prey, after showing how evolute and powerful Predators were some thousand years ago, reducing Aliens to chains and building an entire civilization to guard their zoo-cage, tells us that the best they can do nowadays is to send these pale imitations of the Three Stooges (their race champions, I guess, as they can take this hunt only once in a century) to get their ass kicked in less than a minute.Poor Schwarzy taking that much effort in besting such dumb asses... maybe he should reconsider quitting action and give himself to politics.",1,3,7,8 March 2006
