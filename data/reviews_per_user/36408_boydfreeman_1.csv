Ali," ALI (ON THE MOON)
","I saw an early screening of this movie and it reminded me of Man on the Moon in that most of us have already seen the documentaries on Kaufman and Ali and already know their stories. And in both cases the documentaries were deeper and more enthralling than the movies themselves.  There wasn't any great revelation in Ali.  Will's acting, although better than his previous attempts, wasn't quite able to grasp the depth and emotion of Ali.  Like most of Smith's movies, I would say this was average and will appeal to most, but leave others, like myself looking for something more.",Null,0,0,18 December 2001
