It," Creepy Fun!
","I loved Stephen King's book back in the day. The 1990 TV mini-series was great for it's time; but not phenomenal by today's standards. This current adaptation is fantastic! I have been waiting for quite some time to see the release of this film, and I was not disappointed! It is a horror film, but with with a heavy dose of drama. The character development is well done, and the story is far more immersive than the original. Very creepy, very fun! A+!",10,10,21,9 September 2017
