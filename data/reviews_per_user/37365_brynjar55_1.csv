Sucker Punch," I was really impressed
","It's a bit difficult to give this movie a vote since you are most likely either going to love it or hate it. It's perfect for young men who want to see action, hot women and don't really care if the movie is realistic or not. It has great fight scenes that range from evil samurai demons to Nazi robots, which is completely ridiculous - but they just make it look so good that it doesn't matter... The acting is not bad at all for this type of movie - or maybe its just because the women are so hot that you don't notice the acting, I can't tell.",8,8,15,23 June 2011
