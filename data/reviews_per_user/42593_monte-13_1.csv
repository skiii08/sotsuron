The Blair Witch Project," Its True what the say about being alone in the woods
","I would like to start by saying, it's funny what kind of reviews and opinions I read bout this movie. The most common one is 'It didnt live up to the hype', well I say to that 'who cares?'.I knew the movie was fabricated going into this. I knew the hype on this movie. But I also knew that the movie was bought, they did not make it. A truely independant film, and a remerable horror film.While you are watching this film you may think it is moving along rather slowly, but the deeper you get into the moment, the faster the movie goes, and has gone by.One of the most amazing things about this film is the grip that it has on your mind. You have to listen to the movie, and the fact that you have to listen so hard to the background, that you may start to hear things that arent quite there.The Blair Witch does feel the need to wrap everything up, it's part of the beauty. The movie does not end when the credits roll...you are still left thinking about it when you leave...it doesnt answer any questions, it doesnt want to answer any questions, in fact....it's the movie that is asking the questions and it is up to the audience to come up with it's own answers....",10,1,2,15 November 1999
