Moneyball," Another Brad Pitt eating movie..
","I'm starting to think Mr.Pitt doesn't know what to do with his hands when he's acting. But now he is rarely seen far from finger food. Initially I thought it was a character trait he'd invented for whoever he played in the Ocean's 11 series[ whenever we cut to him he usually was finishing some snack or other...hilarious!] But it seems that it's going to be a regular part of his performance cannon.He indulges in so many snacks, he actually mistimes one and while on the phone sorting out one dull transfer or another, he puts peanuts in his mouth just before he has to speak and then he spits them out.[ Honestly watch it again, it's no planned move] I'm baffled by this long uninteresting story, and why someone as good as Mr.Sorkin got involved. In a nutshell big league failure Billy Beane [ 'Dammit ! We've only got $39 million to spend !!...yeah, that must be tough'] uses Peter Brands system and fails to win the big prize...Why is the film about Billy ? Surely it's Pete's story , he's the underdog who came from nowhere to majors and changed how some teams used players. Billy was losing until he came along.Oh, and that 20 wins in a row ? This film is based around the use of statistics. And statistic's prove that if you do something long enough eventually all permutations will occur. That's why the record had stood so longÂ…it was simply time, not talent.Also Philip Seymour Hoffman, always brilliant, is left on the bench for most of the picture. And when he does appear he's only allowed to field rather than pitch [ Thats a baseball reference right ?]",2,14,26,19 December 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," Batman gets his ass kicked by everyone , some hero !
","Okay, first of all I'd like to compare how much time we see Batman on screen, to how long we see Bruce Wayne recovering from not being very well, after some injury or other. It's about equal. Who doesn't love a film about someone recovering from a serious injury ? Secondlt, he gets his ass handed to him by Cat Woman , twice ! And it's HER who saves HIM at the end ..oh sorry ,should have said spoiler alert.He meets McBain twice and LOSES both times...?!?! Sure, he kicked a few henchmen around but WTF ? So who does he manage to dispatch ? A rather petite woman , who's main weapon was a small penknife...so much for Morgan Freeman's bat armour and his spider senses...oh, yeah that's from one of the other guys.Also McBains Darth Vader speeches, were hard to understand and ultimately unnecessary because he wasn't the villain after all... he gave about six different speeches about...we'll I'm not really sure because, as I said, it was hard to understand.. but that was six to many.Hero's are simple characters, they are better than us, better than any of us ever can be. That is their purpose, to make us strive to be better human beings. When you reveal the hero is as human as the rest of us, you destroy more than the finales atom bomb can , because you remove not only the man but also the myth.",3,4,14,31 July 2012
