Blade Runner 2049," A masterclass in filmmaking!
","I loved every minute of this movie. DV has created a masterpiece, his best film ever and the best film overall since....i don't know?I also love the orignal, but this is even better. It has a more fleshed out story and more suspense. But the classic Bladerunner themes, cinematagrophy and soundtrack is still there. Just the achievement of making us care for a hologram is worth the applause.Hollywood doesn't make them like this anymore. It isn't for everyone, especially the younger smartphone generation ppl that wants the marvel/disney quick fix. This is a slow build and very long movie.10/10",10,1,5,9 January 2018
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Bland and boring with blatant fan service splatted all over.
","This is not a SW movie for me. Dark and brooding characters with no arcs or emotion, jarring editing, crappy score with no (new)themes and so obvious fan service it gets silly. Why even do this movie. I didn't care how the plans for the DS was stolen before, why should i now. The SFX are good i'll give it that, except for Tarkin and especially Leia(shivers...). When Vader showed up at the end slicing ppl i just rolled my eyes. Don't get me wrong i love star wars(or at least 2 of the movies) but this isn't star wars, for me anyways. I liked TFA better than this.Disney is 1 for 2 since they took over, and with an upcoming Han solo movie(which is a TERRIBLE idea) after Episode 8 i guess they are gonna keep that average.Bottomline: The Star Wars magic was just not there...at all",5,5,8,4 May 2017
Suicide Squad," Worst Moneymaker ever?!
","What a total crapshoot. Nothing to care about. No and i mean NO story. I guess DC still can't stand the premise of being a little tongue and cheek/campy. It's soooo 'cool' and 'edgy' and soo 'whatever'. But newsflash: A HUGE disaster of a movie. It's not even a movie, it's a music-video mixed with a trailer. None and i mean none och the chars is likable or relatable or even seems to have remotely any heart(enchantress pun intended). Even the SFX sucks.One extra star just cause Enchantress was kinda cool at the start(hand scene).I mean i couldn't even watch the movie in one sitting, had to break it down in 3 sessions just to get thru it. How can this make so much money? I'm stunned. Come oon people, raise your standards.BvS watch out, you have a new razzies contender.",2,1,2,6 December 2016
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Not that impressive...but a instant classic
","After hearing so much good things about this movie including the fact that it is no. 1 in IMDb top 250 i went into the theatre with higher expectations than i thought i would have. What i feared before i saw it was that Peter Jackson had made it to 'Hollywoodish' so to speak, which means that he wouldn't give it that hard and gritty look which at least i prefer instead of that artie, beautiful and pretentious look, which he in fact gave it. Though it is a fantasy movie and should have those mystical and beautiful moments it's not something that appeals to me so much. Of course it had it's moments; the Balrog scene and the Isildur battle in the beginning was very good indeed. But i expected more from a 3 hour super-blockbuster with supposedly the best visual effects ever. I for one was more impressed by the Matrix and Episode 1 effects. But the thing that sealed it was the fact that i REALLY felt that it was a LOOONG movie, and to me that isn't a good sign. For example when i saw Gladiator i didn't even think of the time, i was so in to the story and the action. I give it 7 out of 10.",8,0,0,30 December 2001
Man of Steel," Bad on so many levels
","Not good . No heart , no story. A darker Superman , killing people and destroying skyscrapers goes against the whole ideology of Superman that it gets a little ridiculously obvious that they certainly can make him darker like they did with Batman . Dad Kent wants to sacrifice children to maintain Clarks secret, and does not want to be saved out of a tornado , happy happy joy joy!! One of the central points of Superman is that he couldn't save his dad from illness, no matter how powerful he is. But here he COULD have saved him, but dad just says NO or just:Talk to the hand Clark!.... WTF!?The stupid Jesus symbolism is just vomit-inducing. Even if i was a believer(which I'm not) this would be cheesy. I certainly didn't see anything in his actions that was 'christ-like', i mean if you don't consider destroying skyscrapers, wrecking some dudes truck, snapping a foes neck, 'christ-like'...Last hour of the film is just an overflow of cgi action with indestructible characters punching each other and skyscrapers collapsing here and there ..... yawn . No, this film is already forgotten. Richard Donners version maybe campy, but it at least had a heart and soul. Man of Steel is as fun as watching paint dry, and sooo extremely pretentious...Why it has over 7 on IMDb is just cause of fan boys in denial. Just like with The Phantom Menace. Almost forgot: Shaky Cam!!MOS and Prometheus has to be two of the most disappointing movies of the 21st century.",2,1,5,27 November 2014
Spider-Man," A movie for kids....
","If i had been seven years old when i saw this movie i would have been SO excited about it. But i'll have to face the facts....i'm not! OK i know the movie is supposed to be corny and all that because thats the way most of the spider-man comics were done. But all i could think of after the movie was how much better and darker it would have been if it had been done the way Todd 'Spawn' Mcfarlane did spider-man at one time. No it just didn't do it for me. The love story was worse than both Titanic and AOTC and just made me bored. Of course a couple of good scenes were there, and for the first 30 min i was actually thinking that this can turn out to be pretty good. But during and after the wrestling scene the movie took a turn for the worse. Rating 6/10",6,0,0,24 June 2002
Aliens," Perfection!
","This is one for the books. A movie will never be so perfect and well done as this one. Pure suspense, action and horror in it's finest form.... I have seen it so many times i can't remember and every time it makes me excited. The effects is BETTER than all the computer bulls**t nowadays and just feels more real. Stan Winston is probably unemployed these days and this is his best work ever. I'm of course thinking of The Queen. And James Camerons only third film happened to be the one he never ever could top, tough T2 is a really really great movie but seriously, a film that stars Schwarzenegger could never be taken THAT seriously.This is the Sci-fi/Action-movie that sets the standard for every other film in the genre...Rating 11/10! ;)PS. I for one wish that Hollywood wouldn't focus so much on fancy CGI and CGI-characters and bring back the real magic that once fulfilled our imaginations....",10,1,2,16 July 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Better than the first? Hard one to judge....
","When i had seen this movie i felt pretty blown away and immediately thought that it was better than the first movie. Then after a while when the movie had sunk in so to speak i found myself only remembering the action-parts of it, and there are a lot of them believe me. The first movie had more heart and soul to it. Of course Gollum had a very good performance as a CGI character and Gimli makes you laugh at times, so there is heart in it.The fact that it didn't follow the book i had been warned about so that didn't effect me except one HUGE thing, to me anyway: The absence of Narsil in Aragorns hands. In the book he uses this white-glowing sword in the battle at Helms deep. I don't know how and when Peter Jackson is gonna 'give' him it. A major fault which really ticked me off...Credit were credits due tho, the opening scene is one of the best in cinema history.The conclusion is that i could go either way with TTT. But all in all i think it's an improvement. 8/10",9,0,0,26 January 2003
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Bloated CGI-fest.
","A repeat of the first, in short, but worse. It's just all over the place, firing CGI at us like it's all we ever need to make us think it's a good movie. A hero movie is as good as it's villain, and Ultron just fails. It's like in the star wars prequels with the battledroids, all robots is just cannon fodder and Ultron himself against 5,6 even 7 Avengers is just....unevenly matched. You never feel any of the avengers is in any danger. The twins are....redundant(with bad Russian accents). Who even cares when quicksilver dies? Why would a AI-robot have a mechanical heart??! And why would it 'hurt' if you pull it out??!? And what's with everyone(incl Ultron) cracking jokes every half a second. We have seen all this in the first movie. But it had a better villain, an actual person, and better timing of the jokes.Hulk/Widow love story is just bad. Nick Fury pops out from nowhere in Hawkeyes shed of all places, i mean this is just bad storytelling.5/10 with my brain shut down....",5,3,9,15 November 2015
Prometheus," In space no one can.....make a script?
","First off. The 1 star i gave it is for the visuals alone(which are great), the rest of the movie doesn't deserve any stars.I was reluctant to even see this movie, because of all the bashing it had received and because i'm a huge fan of Alien and Aliens. I was correct, i shouldn't even have watched it. The first scene just kinda sets the tone: Let's bash 3 billion years worth of evolution and make a dissolved space jockey our ancestor. Am i supposed to believe that the Space Jockeys Engineered all life on earth? Incl. dinos that lived for 150 million years plus, then to be wiped out by a asteroid so mammals and apes can take over the planet? Man that's a bold plan.... Or did they just engineer us? At what point? Was Neanderthals part of the plan? Chimps? Gorillas?Enter The religious Scientist...'It's what i choose to believe'. Seriously? In the 22nd century(almost)?! So much for the Scientific method i guess...And then the crew of the ship, Oh....My....God. 1 trillion (round number that ey) dollars worth of scientists?! I guess inflation must have gone bananas because that crew isn't worth more then a fart in space. They are just stupid stupid stupid in everything they do.Hey let's have an auto-abortion/c-section(of a baby squid) and then run about as if nothing happened, cutting thru the abdominal muscle and all kinds of tendons and then just stappeling it together: Yes! I'm good to go!Let's run directly under the falling space-ship and see if we can outrun it in a straight line!!'Space jockey angry, space jockey smash!' c'mon!?This stupid crap just pisses me off. 130 million dollars spent on this, it's a travesty. Some ppl seem to think this is profound and raises questions about our origins, well it does not. Maybe people just can't deal with the FACT of evolution, and that we indeed evolved from very simple lifeforms.Seriously R.Scott, what were you smoking when you approved this script?",2,20,29,25 September 2012
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Like watching a car-accident, you can't look away
","Lex Luthor and Alfred was the only things that made this movie watchable. Everything else is a jumbled mess, a series of scenes just mashed together. Sure Batfleck does a good job but Batman is poorly written as hell, and it clearly shows that the writers and Snyder don't give a shite about Superman, so they just decide to bash him both mentally and physically, as clearly they feel thats the only way to right the many wrongs made in MoS. Lex is not Lex, but he at least made me laugh, intentionally or not, specially when Superman growls 'Where is sheee?'. That reply he has made me laugh out loud. Wonder woman totally overrated, Doomsday just another cgi-mess, Supermans death had no impact whatsoever. Terribly pretentious and 'dark', stupid slow-motion scenes allover, strange narrative from Batfleck, to many dream-sequences. 'Martha'!!. This movie even turns my review into a mess ;)Bottomline is i did't care about any of the characters or their motivations. Basically all characters are dumb selfish assholes. But still, more entertaining than MoS, in a morbid 'can't help looking at the car-accident'-way.What grinds my gears is that this movie seems to think it's smart and profound. No it's not, it tries to be, but fails miserably. One extra star for the soundtrack, which can be good at times. Superman theme and WW theme is great. Zimmers soundtrack deserves a better movie, just like with MOS. Only thing DC has over Marvel imo.",3,4,7,31 March 2016
Signs," One word: Disappointment....
","After seeing Sixth sense and Unbreakable i had pretty big expectations before i saw Signs, even though i had heard some mixed opinions from my friends. The thing was that i actually thought Unbreakable was better than SS, unlike most of the people i know. So i was thinking that Signs has to be even better. I was wrong...The story itself is probably one of Hollywoods all time-leaders: Alien-invasion....and sure, Schlyman(or whatever his name is spelled) does his thing with creeping and subtle suspense, not underestimating the viewers, as usual. But something is missing, i can't put my finger on it but it just doesn't have that edge that the previous films. Surprise ending? I THINK NOT! It couldn't have been more predictable and actually cheesy.... aliens can't handle water...please! Earth surface is 70% water. Think the aliens wouldn't have analyzed it before they came? I don't.... Nope. Disappointment..... 5/10",3,1,1,18 March 2003
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Flawed, Derivative but pretty Good!
","At last a Star Wars movie with characters to care about again. All of them: Ren, Finn, Poe and most of all Rey is real fleshed out chars with a heart and soul that reacts and acts like someone you can relate to. Sure some of the plot points are straight from ANH and the story is so so.And i do have some gripes with Maz Kanata, Snoke and some other stuff, namely Han being able to find the falcon immediately. Hux and Phasma wasn't good and starkiller base with that sun-charging thing was, well to long of a stretch for me. I mean without a sun how is that planet or any planet around it going to survive for more than one day without it. The big laser wasn't even necessary....But other than that i really liked this movie. It has great action and humor. It felt like star wars and at last someone has the guts to make a female lead that is strong and independent entirely on her own. I mean she learns force powers more or less by just reverse engineering them(The real chosen one!?!). Also Kylo Ren is great, conflicted and vulnerable. Cudos to Adam Driver for making such a complex villain work.This movie has REAL filmaking, not just some double-chinned rich dude sitting in his chair drinking coffee saying 'Faster, more intense' on a green screen stage.....Rating: 7,5/10",7,2,35,17 January 2016
Contact," 'Billions and billions of stars...'
","Carl Sagan is a hero of mine. I admit it. Him and Richard Feynman. If more people had them as role-models instead of sports-stars, actors and models the world would look a very different place, to the better.Sagan never took opposition to religion, he merely asked: if there is a creator, who created him? In this masterpiece he again leans towards that question with religion being portrayed by Matt M and science by Jodie Foster. Of course science is the main focus and i remember Sagan in his TV- series 'Cosmos' often contemplating how a Non-Terrestial-Intelligence would contact us and that his conclusion was by mathematics, in this case prime numbers. This movie is great and has a message that speaks to many people: Have an open mind and be curious about the world and cosmos we live in, and that we are not alone in this universe. This movie is a lost gem in many ways, people these days just needs their quick-fix action-flick. That's sad.",9,2,5,5 June 2013
