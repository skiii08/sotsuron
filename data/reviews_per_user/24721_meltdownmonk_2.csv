The Equalizer," Fun Action Thriller; What the Punisher should have been
","I never thought of Denzel Washington as an action hero actor until watching this film. The more I watched, the more it felt like a super-hero film, and then by the end of it, it felt like a slasher film, with Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) as the monster/serial killer. The plot is the typical one-sided hero wins every fight is essentially immortal type deal. Robert McCall is a good citizen day and night, helping his co-worker get a security job, and befriending an escort and encouraging her to change her life into what she wants. There was so much focus on the character and his habits, and his relationships, i couldn't help but fall in love with the movie (I prefer sentimental movies with a lot of heart) It may have been cheesy, but I was sucked right in, and yet also anticipating some serious destruction and violence.. I was almost scared to see it happen. The fight scenes are brutal and quick, but take moments to dwell on the method of death. McCall has what I would call OCD or extreme attention to detail superpowers, and precise timing of everything he does. He's a complete nightmare for everyone he comes up against, and yet also seems completely harmless, so when he makes his offers to each and every criminal (except the last one) to stop what they are doing, and change, almost nobody listens to him, and an action scene ensues. Despite the fact you know he's going to win every fight, the movie still keeps you on edge. The director likes to dwell on certain shots for extended periods of time. The violence made me cringe and even look away more than once. The exaggerated scenes result in a dark, stylized, moody and intense artsy and overindulgent kind of feel. This is the movie that the Punisher should have been. In the Punisher, it was very difficult to care about the character. In the Equalizer, it was hard not to. And they do little to describe his past, which adds to the mystique, and mystery of McCall. A Monster, a Super Hero, a Action star. Denzel was turned into something like a Jack Reacher/Jason Bourne/Riddick/Bryan Mills in this movie. Dangerous, Thoughtful, Smart, maybe lacking in depth, but plenty or pure action roller coaster ride. Thank you Denzel Washington and Antoine Fuqua for the entertainment!",8,1,3,15 September 2016
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Fun Ride
","As a big star wars fan that was a kid when Episode 1, 2 and 3 came out. I remember cringing at some of the acting and directing in those movies. although I enjoyed them because I wanted to enjoy them. This movie was easy to enjoy - the action was fine, the special effects were fine, everything I would expect from a Star Wars film was in here, there were twists and turns, lots of science type things that aren't explained, but of source it's Star Wars, it's not sci-fi, so it tends not to make sense. I really enjoyed it overall. It felt emotionally satisfying to me, I like the characters - Poe Dameron was less annoying on this one than the previous two. Finn seemed more mature, although less involved. Rey was great, and Kylo Ren/Ben Solo was great. They don't waste time - bringing in the first twist of the story during the opening crawl. This continues right through - with lots of additional info that adds a bit to the Star Wars canon. I think it complemented The Last Jedi and the Force Awakens quite well.I will definitely watch this one again. It had a pretty nice conclusion - leaving lots open for further exploration/speculation/interpretation.",8,2,9,22 December 2019
