Ford v Ferrari," Wonderful acting
",Since I had just visited the Henry Ford Museum I decided to check this out even though I knew very little about racing. It was phenomenal. Everyone in the cast is just perfect and the soundtrack will get your heart pumping. I'd love to see it as an Oscar contender.,9,1,2,25 November 2019
Argo," Best film of it's type since 'Missing'
","This is a great movie with wonderful performances that is not getting nearly the buzz it deserves. Every actor is perfectly cast. I know there's been a lot of complaints about Affleck playing a Latino, but Tony's mother was Italian. I think people are just looking for something to nitpick.The most important part of the film is the introduction, and having the narrator juxtapose the later Iranian woman denouncing the US was a nice touch. That back story was needed, desperately and it was well done.John Goodman and Victor Garber are both delights. These actors never get credit for the range they have. Garber gives the Canadian ambassador the dignity he deserves and I thought it showed quite well the strain that he and his wife were under and the risks they took. Arkin is also wonderful and the play between him and John Goodman give the movie a few necessary lighter moments. The theater I was in cracked up when he said, 'Groucho said that?' and it had been as tense as a tightly wound 70's style watch at that point.Anyone who lived through this turbulent time will recognize what's going on. The costumes, the hair cuts, the big glasses, all are perfect for the time period. Yes, it's not exactly the way it was, but when someone says 'based on a true story' they are not saying, 'This is a documentary!' The movie 'Missing' had the same complaints and it was amazing.I do think the escape went a little over the top, with the police cars chasing the plane and all that, but the movie is worthwhile and more people should go see it. I understand why it got the rating it did based on the number of f-bombs, but I would take any teenager who has heard the word before and tell them this story is something they need to know.",9,2,4,5 November 2012
Les Mis√©rables," Better as a play
","Helena and Sacha steal the show, but the story gained nothing in it's translation to film for me. I really liked the play better. At least then I wasn't surrounded by people whispering, 'I didn't know Russell Crowe could sing!' I have to give everyone credit though for singing live. That was a bold move.I don't think much of Amanda Seyfried as Cosette. Neither her acting nor her singing grabbed me. I liked Isabelle Allen as young Cosette, though. She was absolutely perfect looking and didn't have to do that much acting. I agree with everyone who said it had pacing issues. It didn't flow well for me at all. I wish the loaf of bread theft had gotten more than one quick mention at the beginning. That needed to be dealt with at the start and I wish they could have managed one scene about that part of Valjean's story.",6,0,2,3 February 2013
