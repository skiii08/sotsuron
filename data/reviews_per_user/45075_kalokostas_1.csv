The Perks of Being a Wallflower," A Great Movie with Great Meaning !
","This is my first review and it is one of the best movies I have ever seen . The acting and the story is absolutely good and this movie really touches the feelings that never any other movie tried before . It brought tears to my eyes in the end of the movie . I truly recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't watched it yet , try it out ! It's definitely worth it !",10,1,2,24 June 2017
