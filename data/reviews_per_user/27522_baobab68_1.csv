The Blair Witch Project," Great film, but what does it mean??
","I would echo the reviews I have already read.This movie (or rather, a couple of very specific scenes), scared the hell out of me.The really wonderful thing about it is that you don't (ever) see anything that scares you. It's what you think you might see that's the problem.I didn't even realise until I checked IMDB that the actors are not the directors at all.And IMDB warns against reviewers spoiling the ending... I have to say that I don't think that's possible for this one...",Null,0,1,27 September 1999
