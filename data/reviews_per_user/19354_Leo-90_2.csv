Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Good, but not great, and here is why.
","Before seeing the film (opening day) I had heard a great deal from other internet reviews, reviews of reviews, and the like.To me, the film is very different from the original trilogy, and I begin to suspect why: the first three were very clean in their look and composition -- even if the things shown were dirty and battle-scarred. Here, in SW:TPM, those clean compositions are gone, and with that, to me, a lot of the sense of simplicity and directness that made the originals great is also gone.Also, in SW:ANH, characters took their lines seriously. Here, it seems actors are sometimes addressing the audience directly.",8,0,1,19 May 1999
Tarzan," it has its ups and downs
","First, the film:Disney strives for more realistic, 3d, lush backgrounds...and generally succeeds.  Reversing an unfortunate trend, they also started putting a little depth to the characters themselves, but...Col. Hathi and Kaa are not terribly realistic animals -- what are they doing in Tarzan?!  And have there been any recent Disney males that did NOT have a nose defined by a 30/60/90 triangle?It seems to me that Disney should return to some of the more stylized backgrounds to match their animation -- SLEEPING BEAUTY, for example, unless they are going to attempt to use the very contrast between realistic character and cartoon actor as part of the story.Second, the music:I found the 'soundtrack' to be unexceptional, and the use of the pop star's music to be repulsive.  Sorry, Phil Collins' fans, but it didn't fit. Either have a character sing it, or at least have it 'in the style' of the film -- not in the style of a modern pop singer.Third, the story:I went into the theatre having never seen or read any other TARZAN stories or films.  What was the story that they were trying to tell?  It seems to me that there were several different stories -- fine -- but they failed to really tell any of them -- not so fine.",7,0,2,18 June 1999
