Deepwater Horizon," Well Done Reenactment
","I am doing this review in an attempt to not have any spoilers, even though it is based on real events.I was already interested to see this with a winning cast of Kurt Russel, Mark Wahlberg & John Malcovich. I knew very little about the events surrounding the Deepwater Horizon previously.It did a great job at keeping up the suspense & a good job at explaining industry terms used in the film to a layman. Constant drama, action & a little comedy; as you would expect in a film like this. It wasn't dry like many documentary style reenactments can be. It kept you wondering what will happen next while constantly moving the story forward.Overall I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys well done, Hollywood quality reenactments.Be sure at the end not to stop it too early. There is information about the events that you may have mistaken for the start of the credits.",8,0,0,15 January 2017
The Men Who Stare at Goats," Would have rather watched actual goats
","I was bored this whole movie. It wasn't funny, it wasn't interesting. It was bland.
Not even the great actors cast could save this horrid movie. It was doomed from the start.",1,1,5,6 December 2019
