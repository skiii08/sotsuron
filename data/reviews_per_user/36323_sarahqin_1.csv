Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," I voted Borat for the worst movie 2006
","Borat, a long-awaited movie to one of my friends, was finally screened at the end of this year. Due to my friend's recommendation (I should say he was absolutely a fan of Ali G before he saw this movie), I went to the movies and tried my best to finish the whole movie without attempting to flee the theater though I really wanted toIn this movie, I saw nothing but very low-class comic ingredients like naked body, maniacs, jerks,freaks,whatever you name this kind of people. I could not find any ingenious things featured in previous Ali G shows. I really want to tell Sacha and his whole team: being provocative, controversial does not always make yourself outstanding. In most of the cases, make yourself look stupid and inferior.There are so many scenes that annoy me a lot, like take s**t down the Trump Tower, run through a Hall with nothing on, tell a Congress man that the cheese is made from his wife's tit and even show obscene photos to a elegant woman. I mean all these behaviors are totally unacceptable in our daily life if we consider ourselves educated enough. I don't think anyone could tolerate this kind of behavior. It is not funny at all, it is insulting, humiliating and villainous. As a normal person, I don't take the degeneracy as a way to show you are distinct or humorous and what's more,I don't think well-educated people would do either.To me, the best and profound comical factor is that you successfully make people meditate after bursting into laughter rather than making them feel sick. Comody is what makes our world more lovely and make people more grateful to what they have owned today. It is not something that builds up happiness at the expense of other kind people or even a country sort of already isolated from the industrialized countries.We are happy when we see wonderful things and we don't make fun of people when they are in trouble. The movie 'Borat' completely overturns our existent moral standards, devastates the social conscience and set a very bad example about how to be a decent man. It even raises the question whether we should let this kind of movies into our movie theaters without judging its deadly negative effect on our young generation just in the name of freedom of mind or freedom of speech!Last but not least thing I've got to say is that show appropriate reverence to people and different cultures, only by this way will people respect you!",1,12,26,10 January 2007
