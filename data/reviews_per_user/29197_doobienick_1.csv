Casablanca," The best
","Just a few days ago, a friend ( same age range ) asked me what the best ever, greatest movie ever made was and with barely a thought, I said 'Casablanca'. I really can't explain why but, to me, 'Casablanca' is the best.Casting, direction, lighting. Bogart as Rick, Ingrid as Ilsa, that pairing was perfect. Rains as the Captain, Sydney Greenstreet was perfect as Ferrari and who of the time would have been better than Henreid as Victor Laszlo. Peter Lorre had a great small part, as well.I saw it colorized once and I wanted to have Ted Turner beaten with something heavy.Great flick. A masterpiece.",10,2,3,11 December 2004
