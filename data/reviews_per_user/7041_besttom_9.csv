Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Can't stop watching....must look away....too disgusting to be so funny....
","OK, here is the spoiler - two guys end up naked in a hotel room wrestling on the bed. 1 of them is Borat, the other his producer, who is a fat, hairy disgusting slob. They do us the favor of 'black-barring' Borat's schlong - perhaps they black out too much? Either way, it is SO DISGUSTING to see these two hairy Central Asian guys - and the horribly sexual positions they end up in - that you just can't watch. It's so putridly offensive that you can't bear to even look up at the screen. It is so perversely grotesque that there is no way a viewing audience should ever be subjected to it. AND I COULDN'T HELP WATCHING WHILE ALMOST SPITTING OUT MY SODA IT WAS SO FUNNY!!! I'm telling you, it was like watching a multi-car crash in slow motion. That had to be the funniest scene of one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I thought 'Little Miss Sunshine' was funny and cute. I thought 'South Park' was funny & extremely offensive (duh). This movie was very similar in that way - I can't tell which I thought was 'funnier' or 'better,' but if you enjoyed South Park (BL&C), you will laugh your ass off at this film. It also had 1 or 2 sensitive parts in it, but the way Borat just skewers American culture / ethnocentricity is too much.",7,2,8,5 November 2006
Hotel Rwanda," Don Cheadle Deserved the Oscar
","I saw Ray. Jamie Foxx was good. However, Don Cheadle was superlative in his portrayal of Paul Rusesabagina. A severely underrated actor, Cheadle took on this role as if it were his own life. I can go on and on about how his performance in certain movies (Rosewood, Boogie Nights, Traffic) have either been ignored or down-played. Oh yeah, the rest of the movie - this movie should be required viewing by anyone involved in US diplomatic work in Africa (particularly Darfur / the Sudan) right now.... I can't believe how much I kept seeing the story of Darfur in this movie. Intentional? I don't think so. The DVD did include Cheadle imploring viewers to take action with respect to Darfur, but I think that's because the tragedies occurring there are so similar to what happened in Rwanda and the Western ('Developed') world's response to both is deplorable. Anyway, good acting, good direction, incredible story (truth is stranger...). I have to say the presentation of the slaughter - the fact the movie did NOT contain blood-and-guts violence they could've probably gotten away with given the nature of the story. The use of tension and the threat of violence that surrounds them always makes the movie meaningful and poignant. All in all, this movie should be required viewing for anyone with a soul.",9,0,0,5 May 2005
Ocean's Twelve," Buy the soundtrack, SKIP THE MOVIE!!
","This movie was BAD! I gave it a 2 b/c only tripe like 'Independence Day' gets a 1 in my book. But this had very little to do w/ the original, except the cast (not a big surprise, though - not many sequels do follow the same story). Anyway, here's a stream-of-consciousness list of complaints: Bernie Mac completely marginalized and under-utilized; ditto Andy Garcia and Albert Finney; the tension between the two Mormon (?) brothers is not explained AT ALL & therefor completely unbelievable; the 'plot-line,' if you can call it that, is completely unbelievable - not once during the film did I find myself 'on-board,' or following along with the story; there cutting back to the robberies were trite, forced and not plausible. Two redeeming parts are the jobs put in by the actor playing the Night Fox & the woman playing Brad Pitt's mom.[Some of my details may not be 'on the mark,' but that's because this movie was so bad I don't care to do the research. I want my money back & since I can't get it back, I simply want to warn as many people as possible to AVOID THIS MOVIE AT ALL COSTS. If you're thinking of seeing this movie, just get a lighter and burn your money instead, you'd be getting more entertainment value from the fire (and warmth!!) than you would from seeing this movie.]",1,5,10,11 December 2004
Little Miss Sunshine," The funniest movie I've seen this year....by far
","When I saw the previews for this movie, with its strong cast, I had high hopes. I read a good review in the Wash. Post & my expectations were even higher - which I hate going into a movie, 'cause it's always a letdown, right? Not this time - this movie was funny from go, both a dark comedy and just hilarious. It hits / scores on so many levels. Alan Arkin is such a strong old man for such a loser H fiend. Kinnear is such a loser for someone who sells a system for winning. I can go on and on - and I'm horrible at writing these, so deal. It's a great story of a young girl who I think it's safe to say you wouldn't imagine in the world of pre-teen beauty queen competition. She's gotta go be in a show so the whole family goes along. To say that hilarity ensues would be unoriginal, lacking any imagination & honest effort at reviewing this film. Hilarity ensues. From 1 dysfunctional, chaotic, 'ROFLOL' scene after another, the family (minus 1) finally makes it to the show. Now, I think one of the best parts of this movie is how it skewers the world of young girl beauty pageants. All this poor little Jen-Benet's running around - it's appalling & (honestly) hard to watch. They look like little midgets, certainly not like little girls. It's sad...So just as you're thinking it, Dad & Bro tell Mom to get Olive (the contestant) the HELL out of there. Olive goes and and guess what? More hilarity ensues.Bottom line, this movie is touching, it's real, it's sensitive, it's at times dramatic and depressing - hey, it's like a slice of real life. But through it all, this move is absolutely hysterical. You must see it and you will not be disappointed.",9,3,7,4 August 2006
Ocean's Eleven," Worth it
","Great flick, great ensemble cast, entertaining as hell!Clooney and Roberts' relationship is not well-developed and Andy Garcia's role is underdefined (he seems weak in the end), but all-in-all, it's a very entertaining movie and worth the trip!",7,0,1,10 December 2001
The Departed," Year's best - best in years?
","This is easily the best movie I've seen in a long time. (The last 2 good movies I saw were 'The 3 burials of Malquiedes Estrada' & 'Collateral,' FYI.) Great acting (even from Leo who I don't like), taught drama, the fast pace of this movie never seemed to let up, to me. (I had read reviews saying it dragged at points.) It was just non-stop intense drama and action and an ending - well, I won't give away the ending. It's one of those movies - I wanted to sit back down and watch it again as soon as I got out. Scorsese is SO good, this movie is so well written and every actor turns in a star performance. One glitch seemed to be the editing at points - the scene transitions were at times very quick - maybe too quick at 1 or 2 points - but the audio didn't seem to keep up. That's a trick of his, I know, but at 2 points, I thought it was unintentional. Whatever, that's my only critique, you know? PLUS - hello? Comfortably Numb from the Roger Waters Berlin Wall show? (at least, that's where I think that recording was from) - OUTSTANDING! Not really a 'love song' to me, but whatever, that's one of the best songs ever in one of the best movies I've seen in quite some time.",9,0,2,9 October 2006
The Ringer," Worthless
","This movie was simply horrible. There were no redeeming qualities about it - the sensitive representation of the mentally and physically challenged notwithstanding. Johnny 'Jackass' Knoxville is Not funny, nor is this movie, and in the few instances where actual acting was required, watching him was like (but not as enjoyable as) watching a train wreck. This is another movie that I should have taken out my money, thrown it on the ground, sprayed some lighter fluid on it and cried out 'Flame on!' Brian Cox was horrible - it's pathetic that he's got to take a role like this just to make money. The only thing that possibly could've made the movie more interesting didn't occur (so I won't comment on that any more), but the bottom line was that this movie was not funny (at all) and that was all it had to offer from the outset. This movie was krap.",2,3,9,3 January 2006
Heat," One of my all-time favorites
","This is one of those movies that has it all...outstanding acting, o/s directing, tight writing / dialogue, EVERYTHING! From the incredible performances of De Niro & Pacino - both Oscar-worthy, to the same level of acting / depth provided by Kilmer / Voight / Judd / Sizemore / Studi / Trejo / Haysbert....all of them. Michael Mann's direction, use of light and sound, tight shots and ability to present 'the whole story' with such an efficiency of words and the use of body language / other details is simply how it should be done. His script just crackles with tension, bravado, angst, emotion, it's so easy to get caught up in this film. This film is mandatory viewing for anyone man, PERIOD. It includes (perhaps) the BEST cop / bad-guy, shoot-'em-up dramatic action scene ever (clearly the best of the '90s) and just does such a good job of giving the viewer a glimpse into both sides of the law, without playing into such trite and tried clich√© roles of cops-and-robbers clone films. Heat should have won Oscars!!!",10,1,3,5 June 2005
V for Vendetta," Thought-provoking, Orwellian, but a bit too preachy (maybe?)
","V is a great film - it's got a good storyline, an honorable villain out for revenge against those who wronged him (and, in the process, bring down the Totalarian regime ruling England), and the gorgeous Natalie Portman. While it's hard to argue the Wachowski Bros. do a good job portraying the future in the aftermath of the past we're in the process of creating (What?), it just seems to me they go out of their way to tie almost all the ills of the 'Big Brother' controlled future to the U.S.'s current myopic administration. But as I opened with, they do a good job presenting that scenario. They refer to the wars of the 'Former United States' in the early part of the 20th century, almost calling those wars the cause for our downfall. But what really did us in was our lack of preparedness for Bird Flu (or pick-a-flu), and the controllers of the state of Britain have gone a great length to remind the citizenry of that everyday - drilling fear into their heads constantly. (Sound familiar?) The movie is black, foreboding (depressing, actually), but it tells a story that compels the viewer to argue we're not headed in that direction (at least, if you don't like Bush it's easy to see that). That being said - and I can't put my finger on it - there was something missing. Yeah, we could've seen 'The Man Behind the Mask,' as it was very hard to connect w/ V. (Also, the first chance we hear the hero speak, it's nothing, NOTHING, but words beginning with the letter V. OK, we get it, you can write a good scene, CONGRATULATIONS!) But despite the fact we see the root cause of his terrorism, I didn't connect w/ him because I kept wondering what this guy behind the mask looked like. Alright, enough of that - the action was good - it was definitely from the Wachowskis, but it wasn't 'Groundbreaking' like the Matrix (and I mean that in a good way). The action contributed to the film without making itself the centerpiece of the film. All in all a great flick and - I'm sorry, I have to - any chance, ANY CHANCE AT ALL, to see Natalie Portman is alright with me - she is just plain FINE! (Oh, yeah, and she did well in her role - not great, but OK.)",7,0,2,13 April 2006
