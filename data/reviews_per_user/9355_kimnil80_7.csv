Who Framed Roger Rabbit," One of the all time greats
","This movie is a CLASSIC.There`s no other way to describe it.Fantastic! Everyone knows the story and its characters.Great acting,story,script and animation.And not to forget the direction.Robert Zemeckis makes us believe these cartoons really exists! This is timeless magic! A masterpiece! If you haven`t seen it;what the hell are you waiting for?Rating 10/10",Null,1,1,14 May 2002
Training Day," Yeah!
","...this was a tough actionthriller.Many people don`t like it,it depends on how you take Washingtons character and story.I like D.Washington in this movie.It`s his first bad guy role and he fits it! He`s pretty mean and tough.Ethan Hawke,though,is kind of a sissy and it`s hard to believe this guy`s a cop.But never mind.It`s good,anyway! Story takes place in just one day and we follow the two characters throughout.Very violent sometimes,but exciting and well made. Good direction by newcomer Antoine Fuqua who has captured the realism of some of L.A`s worst drug-active neighborhoods.A memorable piece of work!Rating 8/10",8,1,11,19 May 2002
Dawn of the Dead," I enjoyed it,fun as hell
","Watched it yesterday,haven't seen the original,but think this one is damn good on its on terms. I was shocked.I laughed.I cheered.But I certainly did not fall asleep. Mr. Snyder has done a very good job with this film. I think its funny,scary,exciting and cool..very cool. There sure is a lot of gore,blood and disgusting scenes, but it's also very funny at times and not badly acted at all. However,the most remarkable thing about this movie,is that it manages to be suspenseful.Yes.You heard me.A splatter movie with suspense? Yes,indeed.And director Zack Snyder must get a lot of credit for that. It also has that kind of docu-feel filming to it,like last years 'TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE'.And I think that's cool as s**t! So,grab your snacks and coke,relax and enjoy this crazy ride.And sit through the credits...the ending is a surprise one.Rating 8/10",Null,0,0,23 July 2004
Chicken Run," LOVELY!
",This was good stuff! A lovely animated feature from the creators of Wallace and Gromit.This is way more charming than many of Disneys and Dreamworks animations.Great story and characters; and very entertaining! It is very funny;I`ve just bought it on DVD.It`s a must have.Rank this with Shrek and Monsters INC.Yes! Time to watch it again...,Null,0,0,19 May 2002
Spider-Man," Works really well!
","Comic book heroes are rarely successful to hit the big screen.'Batman & Robin' was a failure and so was 'Steel' and 'Spawn' too.'Superman'(1978)is still the best comic book adaption to hit the big screen after my taste,but 'Batman'(1989)was equally strong too. Director Sam Raimi was the choice for Spider-Man and it was no bad idea.He has made several cult classics,but have never gotten any real success...until now.I think Spider-Man works really well.It`s exciting and funny with way above average special effects.The cast is well chosen;especially Tobey Maguire,he`s the perfect choice for the comic book hero.He has that charm just like Christopher Reeve in Superman,and has like him,much talent.Willem Dafoe is always good and fits his role(s) as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin amazingly well.So what you have is a fast paced adventure with great performances and some romantic moments(with Kirsten Dunst) along.Unfortunately the villain Green Goblin isn`t especially frightening.The costume is just too silly and badly designed,but Spider-Man is great! So;if you like Batman and Superman,you WILL like Spider-Man...Rating 8/10",8,0,0,9 July 2002
Ice Age," Very funny animated feature!
","Wow! This was a BIG surprise! It wasn`t Disney,not Dreamworks and either Warner Bros.It was Fox Entertainment,and they`ve made a terrific movie! Simple story with some nice landscapes and characters.Everything was great.This is a must have on DVD! The movie is moving and engaging,it`s similar to 'Shrek' and very funny! Especially Sid is terrific.Manfred the mammut is a nice and lovable guy and Diego is a little scary,but still a nice person(as it shows up). Hard to find any negative things to say....just watch it!Rated 9/10",Null,0,0,1 May 2002
Vanilla Sky," Shame on Cameron Crowe!
","...for making this forgettable movie.I like many of his movies 'SayAnything,Singles and Almost Famous' were all terrific movies...but this? I was really really disappointed.Crowe has tried to make an original movie,but it`s just plain bad.The plot is ridiculous.It was so hard to understand that I can`t remember anything of it.Cruise is good though,but it doesn`t help at all.And much of the dialogue is really stupid.Especially when Diaz says;'we had sex four times the other night and I swallowed your cum.It must mean something.'-Talk about stupid dialogue...I must say that I was 100% bored during the movie,it didn`t give me ANYTHING.So,my 1 rating goes to 'Vanilla Sky' directed by Cameron Crowe(SHAME!!!)-Rating 1/10",Null,0,0,10 August 2002
