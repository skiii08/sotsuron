Alien 3," This Alien is redeemed
","I just finished watching the extended DVD cut and I have to say that it makes a huge difference. The movie feels more complete and the extra scenes do add a lot to the characters plus adding extra plot-lines too. Some changes are just adding an extra sentence or reaction shot, but what a difference it makes. This movie has redeemed itself in the Alien universe, and will no longer be seen as the weaker of the 4, in my humble opinion. This version gets 8/10",8,2,4,30 November 2003
Alexander," A very expensive, but mediocre documentary
","This movie is really in a mess. First off it jumps all over the place and needs the narration of Anthony Hopkins to try and keep the audience aware of what exactly is going in. This is a true weakness and makes this movie look more like a documentary than a real bio-pic. It covers some key-points, or what the makers feel are the key points, of Alexanders life. This is not offered chronologically or in any other logical order (it even starts with his death). And while Hopkins is narrating away, his mother played by Angeline Jolie decides to do voice overs as well. Heck, we only lack the expert-historians to make this a true documentary.All characters seem very artificial and evoke absolutely no sympathy whatsoever. The movie looks OK and the battle scene is quite good. Even the music by Vangelis is just mediocre and can be described as a cross between his music for 1492 and funnily enough some John Barry 007 themes.Not really worth investing time in I would say; try the Discovery Channel instead.",5,0,2,25 December 2004
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Special Effects Ahoy
","Well, the very disappointing Episode I really got me off wanting to see more new Star Wars, but as I had some free time I watched it on television when it was on.This movie does not show any promise in the beginning, and after the ridiculous chase sequence I already gave up hope. The things that happen in this chase are totally preposterous: after the 'shortcut' Anakin jumps out of his craft and drops a mile and still ends up to catch the one they chased; moments later he loses his lightsaber. But no fear, Obi Wan incredibly has caught up to them and can catch the saber with two fingers. OK, the force is great, but this is stretching it a bit, isn't it?.The movie then splits in two stories (as Empire did): One follows Anakin and Amidala and as the two young ones just need to fall in love, no one bothered to write any interesting dialogue. Anakin turns into a sissy for a while and whines a lot as Amidala wants to stretch the running time of the movie and holds of falling in love proper. Anakin then wants to prove he's not a sissy and decides to go off and rescue his mother, never forgetting that he needs to fall in love by the end of the movie. To makes sure this happens Amidala just tags along not doing anything really.The other story then: Obi Wan leaves the two kids and promptly goes off visiting a lot of special effects. After walking around in corridors for about ten minutes, talking to a few CGI characters, he decides to fall of a roof and then chases Fett Senior and Junior around some more special effects. In the planet he's lead to he then discovers Christopher Lee, also talking to CGI characters. He then gets caught by some more special effects and needs to be rescuedMeanwhile Anakin is getting quite desperate and decides to take Amidala and go and rescue Obi Wan from all the special effects. After being captured and being reunited with Obi Wan, they decide to all fight the same special effects for once. After a while they temporarily turn into CGI characters themselves.Finally, The Jedi and a huge army show up and save the day long enough to warrant a sequel. Oh yes, almost forgot to mention: Anakin an Amadila get married at the end of this part. So do R2 and 3PO in he same ceremony, that explains why they argue so much in the original trilogy.Well, now you know what happens, so you don't have to watch it. You can thank me later.",5,24,46,15 November 2003
Ocean's Eleven," Boring movie with no ending to speak off
","I was expecting quite a lot from this movie and boy was I disappointed. This is a boring story with very bleak performances by actors who don't really seem to be willing to do anything but just read their lines. The 'action' is sleep invoking and you don't even care that anything could go wrong. You can't help comparing it with the original and although that was not the best of movies it stands with head and shoulders above this remake. The Rat Pack version did have the different casino's they robbed, but here it was all compiled into one 'megavault' that seems to be able to be cracked by a granny in between her nap and afternoon tea. There's nothing original about this movie and as said the actors are much underused. The ending is even more boring than the rest of the movie. The cast (sans Clooney and Roberts) just stand there in a line looking at nothing for about ten minutes and then look at each other as if to say 'are we supposed to have any lines in this scene'. Looking at the line-up I even wondered who half of them were as I probably just blinked when their brief appearance was up.Again the original has a wonderful ending, actually together with the original Italian Job's ending my top favourite ending for a caper movie. Give this one a miss and watch the original; at least there you have the chemistry between Sinatra and co (Ã¡nd a proper ending).",4,3,5,11 November 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Another half exciting movie
","This movie fails where Part I failed too: only about half the movie is interesting.  This time round the boring bit was Sam and Frodo who seem so stupid (they get into mortal danger each time we see them) and their journey tells nothing interesting.  Even the appearance of Gollum can't save this dreadful story. The second of three stories is Aragon and friends who meet humans and then battle it out with orcs.  This is quite interesting, but the battle and the end takes too long too keep me awake. But then there's the third story with Merry and Peppin and their fantastic story in meeting Treebeard.  This part definitely saves the story from boring me to death and the end with the destruction of Saruman's Lair (the name escapes me) by the ents is one of the most impressive scenes I ever saw.Overall not a bad movie, but could be a bit more exiting in the Frodo Sam story line, I almost hope when they do something stupid again  they just get killed or featured much less in Part III.",7,1,2,7 December 2003
Identity," A twist to far
","When I heard that Identity lends a lot of the Classic Agatha Christie novel Ten Little Niggers my curiosity was aroused.  I like this novel very much, but never really saw a good presentation on film. This movie does start off as a take on the novel: ten people are stranded in a remote location, they all have something in common and then the killing starts.  It's quite suspenseful and keeps you wondering who the killer is. But there are little hints and another storyline that makes you suspect something else might be afoot.Then all of a sudden half way through the movie you're hit on the forehead with an enormous revelation and plot twist of almost `Sixth Sense' proportions.  This changes the `who's the killer' routine completely and unfortunately also reduces the tension felt before the twist.  But still a very good thriller until the decision of the writers to put in another plot twist at the end that completely spoiled the movie for me.The performances in this movie are anything between average and very good, but it's John Cusack, who seems to get better with each movie, again who really carries the movie.  Both sound and vision are very well balanced to serve the mood of the story.So would I recommend this movie for your viewing pleasure?  I would even with that extra twist at the end that spoiled it for me.",7,1,2,8 February 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," This is why there are fast forward buttons
","So, this is the end and what an anti-climax it is. The Two Towers showed some promise, although half of it bored my pants off.Here again only half the movie is interesting.  The Frodo and Sam part is so boring and repetitive I just needed to use my Fast Forward button to get through it.  This is what happens in this part: Sam screams at Gollum, Frodo defends Gollum, Gollum speaks to himself, Frodo is in mortal danger and Sam saves him.  They've been doing the very same thing over and over again since the beginning of The Two Towers.Then the other part: also a replay of The Two Towers, I'm afraid.  Orcs attack a human stronghold and the humans barely survive.  The battle is even the same: everything is almost lost and then re-enforcements arrive saving the day. It's also quite obvious that Viggo Mortenssen was a very bad choice for a pivotal part in this movie.  His acting is wooden and his courageous speech before the battle is so powerless, mainly because of his wimpy voice and his foreign accent doesn't help either.The ending starts about half an hour before the credits and just keeps going on and on. Aragon is crowned king and that should have been it.  But no, they need to sugar coat everyone's exit till it almost made me throw up.Ok, the source material does dictate how it ends (although the ending of the book was better), but it could've been made better by just ending after the coronation.So 3 out 3 movies that were only half interesting.  So, maybe time for a new cut with only the interesting parts (about three hours for the whole lot would do).",6,13,26,9 May 2004
