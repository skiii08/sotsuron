Miracle," Something to believe in ...
","Back in 1980 Herb Brooks led a group of young men on a dream for the Olympic Gold in Men's Hockey.  The Soviets were the ultimate team and considered the best in the world.  Many of these Soviets had played together for the past 15 years, while the Americans were young men who were coming together for the first time.  Brooks wasn't looking to put together a team of all the best players, but rather a team with the right players.  He wanted players that would play a game of attacks and take on the Soviet's game.  He knew the team he was to put together would be different than if he was going to be going for a National Championship.  He wanted this more than anything and was willing to do anything to accomplish that.I was just a child when the real events took place, but over the years from talking to family and seeing history recap on ESPN, I knew the story.  There were many things going on in the world at the time.  This wasn't just a game to the Americans watching, this was an escape.  This was a way to beat the Soviets.  This was a dream.  This was something to believe in.    It wasn't over with the Soviets, but that was such a tremendous accomplishment.  A bunch of young men beat the best team in the world, the same Soviet team that beat the NHL All-Star team not long before.This was a really good movie.  You don't have to be a sports fan to enjoy this.  It's not all sports.  We see the lives of the coach and the players. This is touching movie and a great one to watch with friends and family. You will really feel good watching it and the best part, its true.God bless you, Herb.  You lived your dream and made dreams for a bunch of kids and whole nation come true.",Null,1,1,3 August 2004
Requiem for a Dream," Juice it up!
","The world of drug addiction is a very a dark scene.  The fact that a substance can have such a grasp on one's life, that they will do anything to score it, is scary.  There are many movies out there, which tend to glorify the life of drugs.  This movie is not one of them.  We get to see the lives of four individuals who are literally rocked by their addiction. The movie is filmed in a way where we get to experience it through the eyes of a 'high' person.  There are scenes that are so off the wall; you just might think you are tripping.I would recommend this movie for anyone who likes movies off the beaten path.  This movie is very stylized, which I love.  I love movies that are not done in the same old boring way.  No, you have an interesting story done in an interesting way.  The movie itself spins out of control as it goes from normal to disturbing.  The creator captured the story in a brilliant way and I think anyone would appreciate that.  So, just take a chance with this movie and I know you will be pleased.",8,0,1,17 January 2004
The Big Lebowski," I am the Dude!
","I was fortunate enough to be introduced to this movie by a great girl.  She couldn't believe that I had not seen this movie and after I started to watch it, I knew why.  Where had I been?  I have no idea, but I can say this was a clever and highly entertaining story.  I loved Jeff Bridges portrayal of Jeff Lebowski, I mean 'The Dude.'  This movie had me laughing and seriously glued to the set.  I would highly recommend this movie to someone who wants a good laugh or a classic movie to add to their movie collection.  I almost went out, immediately, and bought this movie on DVD.  I truly am glad I had a chance to be introduced to this movie.  I hope anyone reading this, who has or has not seen it, would be interested in watching it.",Null,0,1,13 January 2002
Monster," Last Resort
","When movies are based upon true stories, they grab my attention. As the saying goes, 'truth is stranger than fiction' and that surely is the case here. The story was about Aileen Wuornos (Theron) a prostitute who snaps after she is brutally raped and beaten. She takes the mission of killing 'johns' as her new way of life. It is also the way she supports her lover, Selby Wall (Ricci). Before long things escalate further out of control until Aileen is arrested for her killing spree.If the movie accurately portrays Aileen Wuornos, then sure I feel some sympathy for her. Don't get me wrong, she was a murderer and for that she got what she deserved. The first person she killed deserved to die. She probably wouldn't have lived if she didn't kill him. The problem is she didn't stop there. She was on a mission to kill men. She had a messed up childhood and life. The people she killed after certainly were not looking to harm her. She only spared one man. The last person she killed was actually trying to help her. He wasn't even a 'john'. She killed a Good Samaritan. She was arrested and her former lover ratted her out. She was put to death 12 years after she was convicted.This was a really good movie. Charlize Theron was marvelous. She really portrayed the 'Monster' very well. I would recommend checking this movie out. You have great acting and a real life story line. There is many disturbing scenes, but one would expect that in a movie called, 'Monster.'",Null,0,1,8 May 2005
Hostel," a Killer Business
","Hostel is a movie that revolves around two American men backpacking through Europe as a life experience. They meet a young man from Iceland along the way and join up with him as they travel from hostel to hostel. The basic idea of the movie is disturbed businessmen pay big money to torture and kill people. What a concept, right? As Hostel does deliver many unpleasant scenes of blood, guts, and beyond; I do feel this movie had one major flaw. When you first start watching this movie, you will slowly start to ask yourself and others in the room if you are really watching the right movie. Why? That's because the first 30+ minutes of the story seems more like a National Lampoon's movie than any horror. I personally feel they took way too much time to get into the heart of the story. With all that said, it did a very good job at depicting a disturbed world of torture. The idea of that even slightly being possible makes me sick. Many of the scenes are very graphic and are probably not recommended for the light of heart. Overall the concept and torture scenes accomplished the mission of great horror cinema. The over stretched story packed with sex and partying was a bit much. I would recommend SAW over HOSTEL any time, if someone asked my opinion. I feel the original SAW was a better movie in every aspect and HOSTEL had many good qualities, but slacked in a smooth story.Enjoy!",6,0,0,2 July 2007
The Girl Next Door," Great Window View
","This was a movie that pulled me in from the first advertisement. Taken Elisha Cuthbert from 'Old School' and making her into a porn star was brilliant. I mean it was a comedy, so I knew it was going to be something worthy of watching. I just wasn't sure if it was going to be that good. Allot of movies seem decent in the previews, but fall short. I would have to say I was very satisfied with this teen comedy with lots of hot topics. It was a cool story to follow because you had an unpopular kid who has a chance to be with a former porn star. It is a good trip and I would recommend checking it out. The comedy is not on the caliber of 'Old School', but it does have many funny moments.Enjoy!",Null,0,0,23 October 2004
Final Destination 2," Premonition
","I just saw Final Destination 2 for the first time. I really enjoyed this movie. It is another attempt at the original's plot line about how you don't interfere with Death's plan. If you do, you are going to die eventually. It will stock you. You are never safe. This story does have an overlapping connection to its predecessor. There are plenty of cool death scenes. Please anyone reading this I am not trying to glorify death and say its cool, but within the contexts of a horror movie it is exactly that. I saw the original when it first came out so the first premonition seemed foreign to me. I liked that feeling because it added to the overall mood of the movie; although some of the connections to the first movie were not connecting as easily for me.This was a good horror flick. Take a load off while you're waiting for Death.Enjoy!",7,0,0,17 May 2006
The Polar Express," I believe
","The rain is pelting down here in New England and I am happy to be nice and dry. I just returned from seeing this movie at the IMAX Theater in 3D. I knew of 'The Polar Express' story from my childhood. I honestly couldn't remember the plot. I do however remember the great illustrations from the book. So when I heard my nieces were going to see this, I said I would be happy to attend. The expectation wasn't too high because the word around was the reviews were poor. Once the movie began, even before the story started to unfold, I was already completely drawn in. The animation was absolutely beautiful and so much great detail; I didn't care if the movie wasn't going to be great. On top of that the 3D just added an element that an average movie wouldn't have and I loved it. They should make more movies in 3D. After all that talk the movie's story turned out just fine. I liked the story allot and I would recommend this movie to anyone. I don't know if this movie is strictly shown in 3D, but if it is not I would absolutely recommend that's how you see it.Enjoy.",Null,1,2,28 November 2004
Fargo," A simple plan ends terribly wrong
","This is a movie brought to us by the Cohen brothers, who are the same people who brought us `The Big Lebowski.'  It's a story that takes place in the winter setting of North Dakota, where a man comes up with a plan to get some quick cash.  The basic idea is to hire some guys who will kidnap his wife and ask for a ransom.  He will get the ransom money from his very wealthy father in law and split the money with the kidnappers.  I am not going to spoil anything for anyone who hasn't seen this movie.  I will just say that his `simple' plan goes terribly wrong and leaves a bunch of causalities. o This movie seems pretty simple, but has allot of shocking moments that will add to the greatness of the movie.  You have a great cast of characters that portray their roles well.  There is a `simple' storyline that produces many thrills and chills, yet still keeps it flowing at the `simple' pace. 
I was one out of a million people who had not seen this movie in full.  Here it is seven years after it came out and if you haven't watched it, you should.  Take a load off.  It is a very good movie brought to us by very reliable storytellers.Enjoy!",8,0,0,24 January 2004
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Pop my Cherry
",This movie was a great concept that the viewer knew was going to have many funny situations to work with. I can't comprehend how one stays a virgin for 40 years. Andy makes me believe it is possible. Tons of hot girls flowing throughout this movie and it had an actual plot other than just getting a 40-year-old virgin a girl. The focus comes more to knowing there is also the right girl out there. So this is not just full of pointless dribble. The only complaint I have is I felt it way too drawn out. I think they could have shortened it quite a bit. All and all it was a riot and I am glad it ended the way it did.Enjoy!,8,0,1,29 December 2005
Spider-Man," The Web (the beginning)
","I just finished watching Spider-Man and I was satisfied.  I would have to say this is a good movie for many reasons.  For the people (like myself) who have heard the Spider-man origin time after time can enjoy the blockbuster portrayal before their eyes.  The people (like youngsters) whose knowledge of the Spider-man history is bleak, it is a nice introduction to get them caught up.  I believe it was action packed and kept the viewer glued and interested to the storyline.  I have the whole 'Batman' scenario running through my head.  I am sure all of you see it.  That's good.  I just hope the makers of Spider-man can do it better.  I was a fan of the first two 'Batman' movies, but then I feel it started getting bad.  I hope this time its different.  Marvel has finally taken the reigns in a blockbuster movie. We have seen DC comics with much success with both 'Superman' & 'Batman' and now Marvel with 'Spider-man.'  I hear soon we will also have 'Dare-Devil' and 'The Hulk.'  I am a huge Hulk fan and cannot wait for that to unleash itself on the world.  I just hope it's as good as 'Spider-man.'  Oh the one thing that kind of stood out from the comics (to me anyway) was the webshooters.  If my memory serves me correctly Peter Parker never had webshooters automatically when he started his transformation.  In the comics, he actually created the webshooters and it wasn't part of the mutation.  Oh well, I had to get a little bickering in.  Other than that (which there could be more things) I would have to say this was a very nice watch and I would recommend it to comic and non-comic fans. Enjoy!",Null,0,0,1 November 2002
Jarhead," Semper Fi
","Jarhead grabs the viewer's attention from the beginning and carries it through to the ending credits. A movie depicting the harsh reality of marine going through boot camp and being sent off to fight in Desert Storm. War movies always hit hard because you know there are millions of people going through this, even as I type these words. This movie was no more shocking to the system than movies like 'Full Metal Jacket' and 'Saving Private Ryan'. War is real. This movie has many funny parts and thank god, otherwise it would be way to depressing. It really makes you think; knowing the person who wrote the book is also the main character. I really enjoyed this movie. It makes you think and realize how messed up to world can actually be. Definitely a must see movie for anyone who likes war flicks, but believe me you don't have to be a die hard war flicks fan or someone who has served to enjoy Jarhead.",8,0,1,7 August 2006
Saving Private Ryan," We salute you
","I was one of the few people in the world that had not seen this movie.  Last night a friend of mine wanted me to see the beginning scene on his home theater.  I heard so many people talk about the open scene that I was all for the experience in surround sound.  I wasn't planning on watching the whole movie, but it was too late.  This is one of many really long movies, but it flows so well and the storyline just sucks you in.  I constantly kept thinking how would I feel if I was in one their shoes.  I couldn't begin to comprehend how traumatic it would be to go through a war with all you would be involved in doing and the things you would see, you wish you didn't have to.This is a really good movie, which comes to no surprise when it is a Spielberg movie.  This is a movie about bringing a Private James Ryan home after there is confirmation his 3 brothers were already killed in action. This movie shows great passion and there is lots of gore.  This movie doesn't glorify war, but depicts it exactly how it is ... ugly. 
I would recommend that if you have not seen this, watch it.  It is a long movie but it goes at an excellent pace.  It is a touching movie with allot of graphic images.  Allot of what you see in this movie will most likely disturb you.  I just can't stress enough, this is a must see movie.",Null,0,0,29 December 2003
Hellboy," Dark~Horse Commeth.
","I just finished watching 'Hell Boy' for the first time and I was very happy with what I saw.  The viewing started with very little knowledge of the storyline.  In fact, my only really understanding of it was from the trailer and what I could gather on-line.  I was always more of a Marvel, Image, and D.C. fan.  I knew of 'Hell Boy', but past that my knowledge was limited.  I remember seeing the trailer for the first time and I just had to see it.  I love the dark quality and when they mix fantasy with history it just adds to the experience.  I was happy they had an actor play 'Hell Boy' rather than using CGI like they did with the 'Hulk'.  Perlman pulled off a great performance and proved to me an actor could have played the Hulk.  I don't care what anyone says.  I am a lifetime Hulk fan and even though I liked the movie, I disagreed with then not casting an actor to play the Green Monster.From movies like 'Hulk' and 'Spiderman' where my knowledge is far greater, I can tell where they took artistic freedoms with the storyline.  Of course, I have no idea how close they stayed to the comic book.  I liked what I saw and that's all I can base this on.  This movie was very interesting and pulled the viewer in.  There was always something cool happening, like crazy imagery.  It rocked. I would highly suggest it and there is another one in the making from what I hear.Check it out.  Enjoy!",8,0,1,2 August 2004
8 Mile," It aint Easy!
","When it comes to Eminem, I am not really too into the type of person he is. Although (like many) allot of his 'Songs' just get a hold of me and I like the feeling it brings.  You have to really set aside the artist and focus on the work, itself.  This movie is based upon the real life of Marshal Mathers with many artistic changes to make it a movie, rather than the 'Eminem Biography.'The movie does a good job at driving the point, making it is far from easy. Everyone has to do everything and anything to survive.  Many times over it will be through the non-glamorous task.  We have to fight in this life of ours and do all we can to get what we want. Lots of people bust their ass every day to give their kids a better life. That reminds me allot of Rabbit because he works in a no where job so he can save money to become something. He cares allot of his little sister and doesn't want her to live this life.When it is all said and done, this is a decent movie.  It does the job it set out to do.  It became a movie based upon the life of lead role, 'Eminem.'  I would recommend this movie to people who like him and for people who don't, I say put that out of your mind.  Watching the movie, you will forget who is playing Rabbit and focus on the storyline. Enjoy!",Null,0,0,20 July 2003
Identity," who made who
","There are many guess who movies out there like 'Scream' that just blow you away.  I would have to say; I can't recall off hand a good one since the 'Scream' series ... until now!  This movie will keep you thinking and keep you guessing.  There are many well-known actors in this movie and surprises at every turn.  Once the puzzle pieces start falling in place, I guarantee you will say 'Wow!' because this movie is just a constant roller coaster that never ends. I highly suggest to anyone thinking of seeing this movie to watch it.  The movie is done in a good way where it makes you think, but you don't have to watch it 10 times to understand what happened.  In addition, the DVD has another version of the movie with an alternate ending.  I haven't check that out yet, but either way it is a treat.",8,0,0,14 September 2003
A Nightmare on Elm Street," A new reign of terror
","This is a movie about a child killer who stalks the 'children' of Elm Street in their dreams. This is not your typical slasher film. Wes Craven took the one place the viewer can't hide from, their dreams. Freddy Kruger attacks you while you sleep and because we view dreams, things can be strangely altered. This leaves room for many insane, but cool scenes. We get to see a young Johnny Depp in action. This is a must see movie in all horror movie enthusiast library. This is one of the greatest concepts for any horror movie. Please check it out if you like horror movies, this is not one to pass up.Sweet dreams!",8,0,0,3 July 2006
Donnie Darko," 'They made me do it'
","Where was this movie hiding?  I did not know this movie existed until I use to come across it on HBO, but I never watched it.  Lately, I have heard different people talk about it. Did you see it?  Can you believe that?  I wanted to see what all the talk was about.  I went and got the movie.  I went into this experience with the knowledge that this was a really messed up movie and there was a freaky rabbit in it.  With that knowledge in hand, I was ready to enter the movie and see some crazy stuff.  Did I? You can sure say that. This is definitely a movie I would recommend watching and paying attention to.  There are some cool special effects and camera angles.  The movie really makes you think and to me, that's a major plus.  The movie goes into the real dark world of paranoid schizophrenic, but one may think at the end he wasn't crazy at all.  In closing, this is a really good movie that deals with a topic that allows it to explore some strange avenues.  The movie is not all serious and has some laughs as well.  There is a great cast and I think anyone will be satisfied (on some level) with this movie.Enjoy!",8,0,0,13 December 2003
Law Abiding Citizen," nothing is out of reach
","A man's wife and little girl are murdered and one of the men accused gets a deal from the District Attorney's Office. The man (Butler)who is more upset at the injustice of not bringing the killer to trial than the killer getting off goes out for some payback. Despite being behind bars if he wants you dead, you're dead. He makes demands and let's hope you don't fall short of meeting them. This is an interesting movie with some fascinating story lines. I would recommend watching this piece of action. I found myself cheering for the bad guy because he was far more interesting than anyone else in this movie. Oh and without giving anything a way, I wouldn't answer that cell phone!",8,0,0,27 November 2010
