United 93," WARNING: anyone with motion sickness (Blair Witch style) Camera Movement! TOO MUCH!
","I can only gave the movie a 7 out of 10, because, I missed about 40% of the entire movie due to dizziness from motion sickness.I recommend, don't spend the money, if this is going to be a problem for you. Wait for it on T.V..Aside from the dizziness due to rapidly shaking camera shots, I liked the film. I think almost everyone feels pretty sad at the end, and there were some sobs.The motion sickness, its the same thing that happened a few years ago with Blair Witch. For me, I'd say its about 80% of the severity as Blair Witch. One could say, it makes the movie look more like real life, rather than a Hollywoodization of the real event. I really wish the director kept the camera stable for most shots.",7,3,8,30 April 2006
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Well, ok. Not T2
","What you expect and nothing more.. I had huge expectations following T2, one the best sci fi action movies... The T1000 was very cool. The TX?  Would have been cool 10 years ago.  Now its just a mixture of T1000 and T800. Not much new.  However, if you want action, you'll get it. It you want something new, you wont.Has some good action scenes, lots of explosions.  Story is a bit B movie level.. I can see Terminator turing into a TV series after this movie...I watched T2 over right b4 seeing this, and T2 is way better.  Better directed, better story, better characters.",5,0,0,9 July 2003
