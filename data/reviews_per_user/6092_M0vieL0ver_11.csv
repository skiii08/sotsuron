Ford v Ferrari," Watch this movie - it's great.
","Bale and Damon are great together. Bale's character was complex and he wore it like an old shoe.It was great to see Matt Damon in this serious role. He should be proud of this work.The rest of the cast were great. From Ford, to Iacocca. Well done.The focus was narrow enough to really capture the story.It reminds me of cinema past.Whether you are a car or car racing fan or not, you will enjoy this movie. It strikes a great balance for a wider audience.Well done.",10,4,6,11 January 2020
Blade Runner 2049," You better watch the first Blade Runner before seeing this, and even then...
","If you did not see the first Blade Runner, this movie just will not make sense to you.Like the first one, it is a very simple storyline with a lot of fat wrapped around it. Fat as in a lot of time, slow-pace, scenes without dialogue, moody scenes and far-reaching horizons, and on and on. It worked so much better in the the first, something was off in this sequel.The mood of the movie was about right. The visuals were decent.You weren't as engaged as in the first, and the actors weren't convincing. Like they were all just reading their lines. You had no connections, not even to Gosling, who I like very much normally.The music was mostly okay, but then every once in a while the loud odd grunge-like noise would hit and it didn't seem to fit. When you are interrupted and actually stop to think 'hey, weird music there', it's not working.You can easily fall asleep during this movie. I NEVER fall asleep in any movie but amazingly nodded for a few seconds in this one. At an early showing. Make sure you are wide awake and caffeinated. The movie is way too long.The other oddity is the number of breasts throughout. From naked avatars to prostitutes to newborn replicants to statues from an old 'Vegas', what was the point? Replace all the breasts with just the male package and think what the movie would be like. Odd. Gratuitous and dumb. (and not good timing given the Hollywood news headlines these days)The evil guy didn't work either. I don't know why I'm giving this a 7. But I couldn't give it a 6.5, which may be too generous. We can be happy there was a real story here and the overall mood was set, otherwise I would have given the movie a zero. The ideas and concepts and themes are worth thinking about and discussing with friends or family.The 3D doesn't matter and hardly contributes. It's just a bit of fun here and there.",7,4,9,9 October 2017
Midnight in Paris," Awful movie
","How does anyone view this as a good movie? Did they watch the same one?The acting is horrible. Just dead. Did they see the script before shooting? And, did we really see Owen Wilson look at his lines during one of the scenes?The story line. Is there one? Dr. Seuss is much more interesting. The movie should have been titled:Cliché's, Stereotypes, American-bashing, and Left-wing BabblingNot one memorable scene. Not one memorable line. Bad, bad acting.One of the lamest movies I have seen in a long time.And,I have seen every Woody Allen film to date.What a disappointment, to say the least. A total waste of my time.",1,4,13,15 December 2012
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Same ole trashing of the 'right' groups
","Was looking forward to this movie for a while. I have always liked Woody Harrelson and Frances McDormand but Sam Rockwell was a shining star, and Caleb Jones was a pleasant surprise.As far the content and storyline?Trash the following groups:Police officers
Catholic priests and the Catholic religion
War veterans, military menPretty much every tired movie coming out of Hollywood.Pretty much brainwashed with nothing truthful or creative to say.I was mad watching this. I try once again to watch a Hollywood film, and once again it's garbage. We need fresh blood.",1,12,19,24 July 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Please keep making movies Quentin
","From the start I had to laugh. You just know there are some people who confuse Brad Pitt with Leonardo DiCaprio and vice versa. So it was hilarious that Pitt played DiCaprio's stunt double (although we never got a chance to actually see this). Plus, you know people have been saying for years 'Make a movie with both DiCaprio AND Pitt'. Done.A classic Tarantino period piece with a unique storyline. About 30 minutes before the end I sensed a lull, but then, forgetaboutit - it hammered the point home. But be ready for this almost 3 hour movie. You do not want to miss a thing.Classic Tarantino violence, that Tarantino gets away with for obvious reasons.The ending is how we all wished the true story would have ended. For sure. Pitt plays almost superhero status. So does Brandy.The acting is fantastic. From DiCaprio's built-in stutter to Pitt's bond and calmness unless provoked.Fun ride.",10,30,48,18 August 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," The end of Star Wars (Movie making has become a lost art in Hollywood)
","I cannot add much to what others have said. Dumb movie. Disjointed. Just flash and boom, no depth. No story, made no sense. Crappy writing. No emotional attachment to any characters. Empty. You walk out wondering what you just watched and why. I felt nothing and was bored watching it.Hollywood has lost it's movie-making ability. Remember the days when you could capture the heart and interest of children AND adults in one movie with a little effort? Yeah, no more. Talent is left at the door. Greed and dimwits are all that is left.",2,3,6,29 December 2017
Joker," Joaquin Phoenix is Masterful
","The Joker is extremely well written and paced. Phoenix's character, Arthur Fleck, is complex and Phoenix is brilliant in bringing the Joker to life over time. The layering of events and run-ins or interactions with others in the story really work to enhance the Joker's evolution.1 star taken off for casting De Niro. He's a has-been and basically just plays the same thug character as he has all of his life.",9,3,5,28 December 2019
Black Panther," garbage
","Embarrassing set, poorly written script, fake language accent, and off the cuff racist and anti-American trash dialogue.Garbage. There is not much else to say.Marvel has turned into a junk brand.How disappointing.We couldn't even finish the movie it was so embarrassing.",1,11,19,19 May 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," I can't believe how bad this movie was
","Where to begin?What were they thinking casting Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor? He was terrible. Awful. The worst. Enough said there. Script? Non-existent.FX? the only reason it got a 1, not that I could give it a 0.Batman's anger? Not believable.Superman? Weak, spineless, not a superhero. Too much self-pity.Dialogue? Oh my. Written by children. Stuff just happens. No logic. Then more stuff happens. Chaos. Then more stuff happens, and it goes nowhere forever.Really wanted to like this. Can't even call it a movie.Disappointed.",1,5,16,5 July 2016
What We Do in the Shadows," Hilarious! Fun and kooky.
","Such a unique hidden gem of a movie. Strangely stays with you, and you find yourself laughing out loud about some of the scenes afterwards. Watch it with a friend.Well done!",9,3,4,18 August 2018
Easy A," tired of the ant-catholic anti-capitalist darts
","I watched this movie due to the fairly good reviews.I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.The acting is so-so (no one in particular stands out with the exception of Olive's parents). Everyone is so dry, even when done by the usually dry playing character portrayed by the English teacher. This was a throw the kitchen sink at it kind of movie - which jumped it around way too much to keep you that interested.Cliché after cliché.And, as usual from the Hollywoodesque crowd - it's not so subtle darts thrown at capitalism and religion - but, of course, mostly the Catholics, and only Christianity. It's so yesterday, and it's just getting old when projected so blatantly.'Yawn' on this movie.",1,21,40,10 March 2012
