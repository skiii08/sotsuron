Requiem for a Dream," A Good Movie With a Good MessageÂ…But Do Not Be Fooled
","I first saw Aronofsky's Pi when it first came out.  I was, at the time, more or less confused.  It has since seemed to make more sense but I was definitely impressed with the direction of Aronofsky.  He made good use of black and white film and created some lasting images in my brain.  This is not, however, a review forum for Pi.
'Requiem' had been recommended to me by a few of my friends.  I rented it, and expected a similarly-directed movie to 'Pi'.  I was right, but I didn't know how right I was.  The scenes where there a quick cuts of the blood, the paper, the eyes, and other things were perfect.  The sound effects were amazing.  I was also very impressed with the use of the violin players.  The music added a lot.  Good performances all around by the cast, especially Ellen Burstyn.I agree with others, this was a good movie, but not one of the best ever, or even for the year.  The directing was impressive, but DO NOT MISTAKE GOOD DIRECTING FOR A GOOD STORY.  I know that I have seen weaker stories, but I have definitely seen better stories about drugs.  ('Traffic' is the perfect example.)A solid 8/10 stars.",Null,0,0,10 August 2001
