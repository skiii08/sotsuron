The Devil's Advocate," Haha, great movie
","If just to see just how BAD Keanu Reeves can act compared to the genius of Pacino. The comparison is so bad, so overwhelming, that whenever the two are onscreen together, you feel so BAD for Keanu. the poor guy, even HE has no idea why he's such a big star. 'Whoa!' indeed. The flick itself is pretty good, except for the lame-brained ending, which completely destroyed everything the movie built up to in the previous 2 hours. Nix the horrible ending, and end the film with the scene we all wanted to see (You KNOW what scene I'm talking about *wink wink*) and this movie would be incredible. As it stands, it's just good. P.S. I'm unable to decide rather Reeves is a worst actor than Theron, or if they're both equally bad, but whenever the two are onscreen I feel like someone just stole my wallet. They are so BORING and bland. Compared to the not-always-attractive Pacino, you have NO QUESTION as to why Theron and Reeves made it as actors -- and folks, I ain't talkin' about talent here.",Null,1,2,22 March 2001
Final Destination 2," Better than the first
","FD2 proves that a sequel CAN be better than the original. Tighter, much more clever, and generally better in every way than the original, FD2 is a treat. Best of all, it treats Death as more of an 'accident' or a series of 'coincidence' rather than, as was the case with the first, some dark demonic force.Definitely a superior film than the original.",8,0,0,4 May 2003
The Bourne Identity," Erg, I need a bath
","What a filthy, stupid little movie. Matt Damon provides a nice action role, but the rest of the film is utterly pitiful. Imagine the writer/director somehow getting it into his head that he could improve on Ludlum's novel. My God, what was he thinking? This movie is so simplistic and so dumb that I could feel my IQ getting lower and lower as I was watching it. How could you possibly take Ludlum's complex and intricate storylines and turn it into a movie about a guy running around Paris dodging dumb French cops (that's an oxymoron, isn't it?) and shooting dumb French people? Oy vey. Where is Carlos the Jackal? Where is the intricate web of deceit? Stupid, stupid, stupid. It's a good thing Ludlum is dead or he might have a stroke after seeing this...thing.",1,7,17,6 March 2003
The Bourne Identity," Unnecessary and stupid
","One of the dumber espionage films I've seen in my life. Not only does it NOT have any resemblance to Ludlum's book, it doesn't even deserve to lick the boots of the Robert Chamberlain miniseries, and when you're worst than a Chamberlain miniseries, you're REALLY bad! The film is one big chase where Bourne is pursued by dumb French cops (gee, isn't that an oxymoron?) and the Evil American Government (notice the capitalization) that goes around murdering civilians like they breathe air. There is no subtlety whatsoever and I'm at a loss why they name this movie after Ludlum's book. Talk about tarnishing a great book!",1,8,26,9 January 2003
Tigerland," Good movie
","The best thing I love about reading reviews on IMDB.COM is that you have people from around the world reviewing movies. And I always laugh myself silly when I read reviews by non-Americans on American movies, and these guys will invariably point out how evil and mean and 'bad' the U.S. is. I mean, duh -- review the movie, numbnuts, not the country it came from! LMAO.Anyways, great movie. Good acting. The basic training physical abuse stuff is perhaps a little much. A drill instructor assaulting a draftee to within an inch of his life and nothing happens? yeah, right. Another drill instructor trying to electrocute another draftee's scrotum? PUH-LEEZE.Still a good movie. Watch it. And oh, watch out for the American bashing comments by other reviewers. It's a riot!",Null,0,1,17 April 2003
28 Days Later...," Terrible remake
","nothing more than a remake of george romero's DAY OF THE DEAD and DAWN OF THE DEAD. any real fan of zombie/horror will immediately see the thefts in this boyle thriller. the first half has a number of original flairs, but the whole running-like-they're-on-PCP infected killers are just plain silly. for instance: why doesn't these guys attack each other? they're homicidal, urged to kill, and for some reason they don't attack the most convenient targets -- each other! what happened to the cars? the roads are all empty. and where are all the bodies? for that matter, why are these killers afraid of sunlight? what, did the virus also make them think they're vampires? the film's entire second half is nothing more than a remake of DAY OF THE DEAD, complete with captured zombie and insane soldiers. morale: 'man is the worst killer.' romero already did it, and did it better, 20 years ago.",1,9,18,1 April 2003
28 Days Later...," Overhype British Nonsense
","I won't bore you with all the illogical happenings of this film, since most people here (at least the smart ones) have already mentioned it. What must be said, and I can't stress this enough, is how UNORIGINAL this tripe is.But I don't blame Garland and Boyle. If I was surrounded by a world full of idiots who don't remember movies like THE OMEGA MAN and DAY OF THE DEAD, then i would steal both of those movies too and join them up into one movie. And oh yeah, throw in DAWN OF THE DEAD along the way.To whit:28 DAYS LATER steals from THE OMEGA MAN in its first 40 minutes....the 40 minute to the hour mark is stolen directly from DAWN OF THE DEAD......leaving the final hour to steal completely from DAY OF THE DEAD.All I can say is, Boyle and Garland better get themselves a good lawyer, because a TRUE genius name George Romero is probably getting his lawyers right now for a lawsuit.",1,4,7,6 July 2003
Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War," Familiar, Clich√©d, Overwrought, and WAAAAAAY Over-hyped
","I don't think TAEGUKGI is a bad movie. In fact, I love war movies. Maybe that's why I can see all the film's faults, since most people who have seen it (you'll noticed that the bulk of the giddy and over-the-top compliments for the film are from nationalistic South Koreans -- that's never a good sign) seems to looooooove it, I just had to throw in my two cents.Okay folks, here's the thing. YOU'VE SEEN THIS BEFORE. You've seen it all before in RYAN, in THIN LINE, and done at least 50 times better in BAND OF BROTHERS. Heck, even the TV movie LOST BATTALLION has already done this! So where does that leave TAEGUKGI? Well, not much ground to cover, that's for sure.And here's my biggest nitpick with the film: if these soldiers got tossed into a train and drove immediately to the battlefield (i.e. NO BASIC TRAINING!!!) how the heck did they learn to fight, shoot, and even lay mines??? I mean, one guy is a shoeshine boy! The rest are just regular civilians! How the heck did these guys go from shoeshine boy one day to Rambo the next??? It doesn't make sense. And NO ONE has mentioned this.Hey, maybe I've just seen all this before, but don't try to sell me hype and tell me to like it. I've seen this film 100s of times before. Just because it's made by a South Korean guy doesn't mean it's super brilliant and original, guys. Get a grip and wake up.",5,11,40,1 October 2004
Vanilla Sky," More mature than OPEN YOUR EYES
","Strangely, this version of OPEN YOUR EYES is more mature and more nuanced. Aided by hindsight, Crowe's screenplay is a lot tighter and more fleshed out than Amenabar's original. The Spanish filmmaker should get credit for thinking of the story first, but there's no doubt that Crowe has improved on it -- if just slightly. Notice that you have no idea what the lead did in OPEN YOUR EYES, but you know almost everything about the lead in VANILLA SKY. That's what i mean by more 'fleshed out.'",9,0,0,7 March 2003
X2: X-Men United," Good sequel, but not great
","X2 is definitely better than the original, but considering that the original had as much excitement as watching paint dry, that's not too much of an improvement, is it? Still, for a big budget Hollywood movie, X2 is strangely dull. The only bright spot is when Wolverine destroys STryker's soldiers in the X-Mansion. The rest of the movie is about 30 minutes too long. And boy, did the ending drag on forever! I was ready for this film to end about 30 minutes before it finally did.",7,0,0,6 May 2003
