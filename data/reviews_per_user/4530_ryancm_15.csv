The Hangover," Funny...BUT
","While THE HANGOVER has ONE fun moment it's quite illogical. Even a comedy should have some logic to it. I know it made lot's of money and had some critical acclaim, but there are too many odd moments that don't make sense. SPOILER ALERTS: A) THE SUITE. After the big night, the room looks like a tornado went through it or even a major earthquake...but later in the day when the guys return, the suite is just as it was when they originally arrived. No way could the room have been fixed up in a few short hours. It would have taken days of weeks to re-new it. ILLOGICAL. B) THE BABY. How could a baby be miss placed in a cabinet for such a long time. It would have suffocated. The Mother should have been arrested for child abuse and be put up for adoption. And leaving the baby in the car for so long a time? And what happened to it later in the film after it's so called 'mother' got it back? ILLOGICAL. C) THE LION. It was dangerous and wild when they saw it in the bathroom. When the guys took the lion back to where it belonged,no one NOTICED it? Incredible. When in the car it clawed and damaged the inside of the car. Earlier then the 'kidnapped' the lion, how then did they get the tiger out of the house, into the car, into the lobby to the Hotel without people noticing and not being clawed and mangled or harmed at all. If it was wild when they discovered it, how was it tame enough to get it in the room? ILLOGICAL. D) THE CHICKEN. How did a chicken get into the room in the first place, and what was the purpose of it, other than being stupid. ILLOGICAL E) THE Asian. What gives here? How did they get him naked and into the police trunk? Why did he wait a whole day before pounding and making himself known? He didn't suffocate? ILLOGICAL.In movies of this ilk, don't the writers READ what they write? Doesn't the director or actors question these insane and bizarre circumstances and inconsistencies? Doesn't anyone CARE to make a movie that makes sense, even if it's just a little sense? Maybe it's let's make an inane movie, hope the young people of America fall for it and TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN.I'm sure for those who loved this movie will have to agree to the above plot holes.Oh, and performances are really bad, especially the guy playing the fat, dumb airhead. Ugh!! What planet did HE come from? An the 'masterbating' baby was obsence..",4,2,5,17 December 2009
Star Trek," Terrible
","A one is too much for this trashy movie. A zero is more like it. First, the story makes no sense. Couldn't keep up with the plot, holes and all. Second, the acting was horrible! I've seen much better acting in High School plays. Where did these actors come from? Grammar school? Even worse was the way it was shot. Wiggly camera shots do not make for enjoyable viewing contrary to what the Director and head honchos who make photograph these movies. Even when the camera is on somebody the camera NEVER STOPS moving...either side to side or around the actor or action. WILL YOU DIRECTORS STOP USING THIS WAY OF FILMING ACTION MOVIES??? The only decent thing were the credits because the movie was FINALLY over...and yes, nice theme song which should have been utilized more. Forget this dog. Good thing I saw this at no cost!! I still feel cheated!!",1,8,15,28 November 2009
Superbad," The title says it all!!
","Yes, SUPERBAD is aptly titled. It's S U P E R B A D. Can anyone in Hollywood write anymore? Must every other line be a F--- word? I've been around quite a while and know hundreds of people both at work and play, and no one, I mean NO ONE uses language like the type of movies made today, be it comedy, drama or action. It's an insult to audiences and society to put such dialog on the screen. There may be a rare, very rare instance where it might be acceptable. But my, my must it be used in every modern film made? So why did I rent this movie? I had heard some pretty bad things about it but I thought it couldn't have been THAT bad. It was worse!!! Stay away from this garbage and other garbage like it. Thank goodness for DVD so one could rent the great films of the 30-'s thru the 60's.",1,7,26,7 December 2007
Juno," could have been better
","While not a bad movie (I've seen so many of the newer films that are terrible), JUNO could have been a lot better. The characters do not ring true, especially JUNO herself. Very annoying character, or maybe it was the performance of Ellen Page. She and Michael Cera were supposed to act 'normal' that they made their characters 'unreal'. Trying to act natural was the biggest drawback to their performances. The stuttering and stumbling for words don't work. Picture would have been better with better actors. Can't believe Ms. Page was nominated for an Academy Award. All the other actors were just fine, especially J.K Simmons and Alison Janney. These young 'actors' could take lessons from these pros. I'm sure part of the problem was the direction. The story is so good, but the execution of it was not. Also, a bit to 'quirky' for me. A very pretentious way of film-making.",5,2,7,24 April 2008
The Bourne Ultimatum," Could have been
","This could have been a great movie. Good story line and acting. Exciting from start to almost finish. I said ALMOST, but because of the horrible shaky camera work and too quick editing, I had to turn the damn thing off. Come on folks, why film a class A movie with amateur camera work? Looks like a home movie....even worse! Do any Directors/Producers read these comments? If you do, PLEASE film action movies where you can see what's happening and don't spoil it with choppy and shaky camera movements. Even in a close up in during a serious conversation, the camera wavers and tilts. Why? Takes away from any enjoyment and concentration of the scene. So annoying for such a good movie. So to all filmmakers, come to your senses and film a movie so people can see it and not feel nauseated. Two people said they left the Thetre and got refunds because they stand the filming technique. Now I know why!",7,0,1,12 December 2007
Burn After Reading," Bazzar and great
","BURN AFTER READING is one of those 'love or hate' film. I loved it. As usual, the Coen brothers thought of something unusual and brilliant. The pair are one of a kind. No reason to go into the plot because basically there is no plot. The acting is nothing short of sensational, even the bit players. Brad Pitt is a stand out. Who knew!! He is becoming a great character actor despite his great looks. Let's have more like this for him. The only shortcoming is that certain scenes seemed to end on the cutting room floor or perhaps were not filmed. They should have been to fill out some of the holes, but nonetheless, no biggie. SPOILER ALERT. Also, no one explained what happened to the car Brad Pitt was driving when he went into the house and never came out. Couldn't that explain his absence? Oh well, another minor plot hole. Whatever you do, just enjoy this Coen brothers treat.",9,2,4,19 January 2009
Disturbia," sub-par teen movie
","While it has a moment or so of entertainment, DISTURBIA is not a good film and shouldn't be seen by anyone who loves thrillers. Everyone know the plot a la REAR WINDOW. What troubles me the most are those stupid plot holes which is laziness on the script writers part. The ending is the worse thing about the movie. The killer disappears for a while, the surfaces again? Why the wait? With so much going on with screaming and the noise of the fight, no other neighbor's notice? When the girl jumps out of the pool, she presumably goes to her parents and calls the police. Where were they? They come so late? The killers house is like the 'house of horrors'. Who can make a place with so many secret walls, floors and compartments? You'd have to have a mansion, not a suburban home to configurate such a place. Would a killer really settle down in the burbs? With his killings, why leave all the windows uncovered for anyone to see? Doesn't anyone think about these things when making a movie? Don't they sit around a table and discuss impausabilities? Do they think audiences are going ae not going to think? Of course these types of movies aren't made for the general public, but for kids who don't think I guess. Anyway, a waste of time and forget this one.",2,10,17,8 August 2007
Tropic Thunder," Not for the prudish
","Mixed reaction on this one. Some funny moments, but a bid disjointed. Very crude and not for the prudish. The language and Jack Black's description of a b... J.. was unnecessary. What kind of 'talent' lies in these types of new 'anything goes' types of writing? How about the good old days of good old fashioned funny movies like SOME LIKE IT HOT or AUNTIE MAME that don't depend on vulgarities of todays film. Of course that was the days of yore and one must fess up to the new age of film making and audiences taste buds. Looks like most of these are made for males the age group of 18-29 years old. Having said all this I did like some of the performances, especially Tom Cruise. I'm not a fan of his, but he was the best thing in the movie. A stroke of genius in his casting. Well done Tom!!",5,1,3,30 November 2008
Revolutionary Road," Disturbing
","I liked REVOLUTIONARY ROAD, not love it. Much to dark with not much character development. Why was this couple the way they were? The saving grace of the film is the terrific acting by all....KATE WINSLET could have won the award for this and not THE READER. SPOILER ALERT: Ironic that she should die in both films. Suicide in one and an apparent suicide in the other. Strange. A couple of minor nit-pics. Through the film, the kids were only seen briefly a couple of times. Where were they during all the home scenes? Once they we are told they are a birthday party, but what about all the other scenes. The one big fight scene at the end, where were the kids? It was late at early evening that stretched to the late evening? No kids? Also, didn't this young couple have any parents or siblings or aunts or uncles. No mention is made of family. Didn't they ever visit? They were not even talked about. Very strange indeed and NOT realistic.",5,4,7,2 June 2009
Drag Me to Hell," Super-stupid
","This wasn't a supernatural film. It was super-stupid. Unless this was all a dream (and it could have been), this was a waste of one hour and 39 mins. Nothing made sense and the acting was atroucious...especially Justin Long. How did he ever get cast in films? So many talented actors out there and directors cast him??? If one is into special effects, that's fine as they are well done. This movie is not the least bit scary. Things that COULD happen, like the Holloween movies and Friday the 13th are a lot more frightening...supernatural is just that...supernatural and unbelievable...so what's to be scared of? Don't waste your time with this one. You'll be DRAGGED TO HELL.",2,0,4,14 October 2009
The Holiday," So so
","While I enjoyed the premise of the movie, there were just too many implausibilities. How did each women get into each others homes? There were no keys to be seen. How did the Kate Winslet character get passed the locked gate AND into the house? The taxi driver couldn't take the Cammeron Diaz character to the cottage because of the heavy snow. Fine. Just a scene later, Diaz is in a car (where did that come from), driving through the snow. She's from the US, never driven in the UK where they drive on the opposite side of the road with the snow yet, but she does it just fine. Who takes care of Jude Laws little girls when he's out so much? A supposedly good Dad, but why so much drinking and showing up at the cottage smashed? What about the dog? Did Winslet just leave her dog there with no care? Who would leave a dog alone for so long? How did she know the Diaz would show up and even if she liked or was allergic to dogs? All these are important issues what were never even addressed. Despite all these holes, most of the film was enjoyable except for Diaz manic performance. Was she on drugs when she made this? Everything she did and said was so hyper. Kind of spoiled her character. Slow down girl. Ms. Myers should have been aware of the dreadful performance. All the others faired well, especially Jack Black. Of course every one knows from the onset of meeting each character how this movie will turn out...and that's OK. A 'feel' good movie which would have been a feel 'great' movie if it were not for these implausible situations and Diaz over the top performance. Also, her character shows not a bit of shame by having sex with someone she has met five minutes earlier. Not nice, although the blame for that goes to MS Myers screenplay..For shame.",5,0,1,30 May 2007
The Reader," Disturbing
","THE READER is a somewhat disturbing film that is hard to dislike. Interesting story and some great photography, direction and acting. The disturbing aspect is the character flaws in both Hannah and Michael. He's always so remorseful with tears coming out of his eyes every five minutes. Hannah is a difficult character to understand which makes it all that more disturbing. What's so shameful about being illiterate? While there were no excuses for what she did as a camp guard, she could have saved herself by admitting she couldn't have wrote that discriminating letter. To compound that, why doesn't Michael go ahead and defend her? Just plain stupid and totally unbelievable, yet fascinating. KATE WINSLET and David KROSS were extremely good in their roles, less so Ralf Finnes. As an adult, the older Michael should have seen an analyst as he is troubled throughout his entire adult hood and a wimp at that. He needed as much help as Hannah in his own way. The time lasps are a bit illogical as well. One of the best performances, however, is the one given by Lena Olin as both mother and daughter. A brilliant performance what is never talked about or discussed. She should have been up for a supporting award at least. How does the public and critics let these performances slip by the wayside? Too much attention on Winslet I guess. Despite reservations, THE READER should be seen. Good DVD extras plus lots of deleted and extended scenes.",7,0,0,24 May 2009
Shooter," ho hum adventure
","While certainly watchable, it's quite improbable, but so are most action movies. Enjoyed watching it, but when it was over and one starts to really think about it....well...not so hot. Forget SUPERMAN. The main character does everything Superman does without the cape. My, my, what an incredible man. Even when he gets seriously hurt, he recovers almost in an instant and is off running, rolling around and doing all kinds of stunts without even a twinge of pain or stiffness as a real person would. The plot was quite convoluted and didn't quite make a lot of sense. Some of Mark Whalbergs dialog was hard to understand, and Danny Glover even worse. Again, kind of fun to see, but don't think about it too much.",5,4,8,16 July 2007
The Proposal," Predictable fun
","Yes, THE PROPOSAL is predictable from the beginning, but who cares? It's fun seeing how it all comes out. Some good performances (especially Sandra Bullock and Betty White) and scenery help make the 108 mins. of run time go by painlessly. Looks like a few moments were left on the 'cutting room floor' as there seems to be some elements and time frame out of sync. Actor Denis O'Hare who plays the immigration officer has a silly role and he overplays it terribly. Not a good actor at all. Spoils the few scenes he's in. For a nice evening with popcorn in hand, THE PROPOSAL fits the ticket. At least there's no foul language, sex scenes, car chases or explosions!!",7,0,2,14 October 2009
Up in the Air," Smart movie
","While not the best picture of the year, UP IN THE AIR deserved its nomination. Good writing, directing and acting all around. Would have liked to have seen the Vera character more fleshed out as to :SPOILER ALERT: why she carried on with Ryan as she did and looked like she wanted to be with him in a long standing serious relationship, all the while being MARRIED yet. It was like she had a split personality. If she was that unhappy in her marriage, although it's never acknowledged, why didn't she just leave the marriage? To carry on like a slut all over the place, being a mother yet, just didn't make sense. How she managed to be away so much with the Ryan character, do her job and have a home life is beyond reality. Other than that, a very enjoyable movie with an interesting story line. George Clooney was at his best and young Anna Kendrick just about stole the movie. All in all a worthwhile rental. But the ending and the Vera character left me UP IN THE AIR.",8,0,2,14 March 2010
