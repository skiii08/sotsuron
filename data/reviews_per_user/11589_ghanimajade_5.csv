Changeling," Excellent!!!
","Okay, there's not too many movies I'll come on here and make any hype about but this one is one of them. Yes, it's a bit on the long side but the story is very interesting. I started it at midnight was was never once bored.Angelina Jolie, Jeffery Donovan, Michael Kelly, and of course the great John Malkovitch all gave wonderful performances. Clint Eastwood is proving to be a GREAT director as well, I haven't found a movie of his bad since he started directing, I'm hoping he keeps it up.The only thing I can say is the lead cast is great but the one I thought gave the best performance is Michael Kelly. My favorite scene is when he's talking to the 15 year old boy about the missing children. Which is also the most powerful scene in the entire film.I highly recommend Changeling. Well done to the entire cast and crew. 10/10.",10,4,5,21 May 2009
Star Trek," From a Life long Fan....one hell of a movie
","I was raised on Star Trek, all of them, there isn't a movie or series I didn't like. Setting aside the fact that there were some big changes made to the continuity this movie delivered. The changes are made for a reason and explained within the show.The cast was fantastic, Quinto and Urban were dead on in their performances and Chris Pine was (in my opinion) better than William Shatner. Ben Cross as Sarek...no one can replace Mark Lenard but he was trying his best. The way Mr. Abrams filmed it and how it was written just added to the excellence.The music was original except of course the end and fit the film to a tee. There's drama, action, and comedy all woven into a great script, acted and filmed very well.You don't have to be a Star Trek fan to enjoy this movie, it speaks for itself and I highly recommend that you see it. 10/10 from me.",10,9,23,10 May 2009
Alexander," Excellent!
","I enjoyed this movie because it stuck to the historical end of it. I didn't care about the sexuality in the film. I don't care about all the Razzies it's getting and or all the flack that critics and the public are giving it. Oliver Stone and his entire cast did a bang up job on this movie and I commend them for it. Bravo! Bravo! Colin Ferrel was a brilliant pick for Alaxnader, the cast was nothing shy of awesome and the best part about the film was that they actually got Bucephalaus as close to correct as possible. Well Done! ****** As I said BRILLIANT! EXCELLENT! WELL DONE! I watched this movie 5 times and can't wait for it come come out on video.",10,1,18,14 February 2005
Troy," Very, Very Good!
","I thought this movie was worthy of all high marks it received. The producers and everyone who worked on this movie did a bang up job on it. It does follow the Iliad but not to the letter.. if they did that the movie would be 7 hours long. Yes I have read the Iliad and when I saw this movie I was wondering what they were going to leave in and take out. Again, I say they did a GREAT job. And the lead cast.... what a cast! Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, Orlando Bloom, Sean Bean, and Brian Cox just to name a few very well acted and they all fit their character. Sean Bean, a seasoned actor and did a great job as Odysseus. I believe that this movie deserved more respect than it got.",9,1,3,4 July 2004
The Expendables," Bloody Excellent!
","This movie brings you back to the great actions movies before CGI and ego's ruined it all. Stallone does a good job of bringing the greats of action together for one explosive flick. With a cast like Jet Li, Jason Statham, Dolph Lundgren, Stallone, Mickey Rourke, and Eric Roberts you know its gonna be packed with action.I was impressed with Randy Couture and Terry Crews but I was delighted to see three of my favorites have a good showing. Jet Li's still got the jets, Jason Statham's hot anyway and I was a bit disappointed his shirt stayed on, but Dolph Lundgren was the kicker for me. I still love Universal Soldier and it's great to see him back in action.Critics will say this movie is for nostalgic movie goers but they wouldn't know a good entertaining flick if it bit them in the a**. Yes, there are some corny lines and macho moments, what movie doesn't have them? There is humor but it's not a comedy, this is not a chick flick (unless you're me) check your sophisticated adult mind at the door and let the explosion, fight scene, motorcycle, Martial Arts, and Gun loving side out to have some fun.",9,5,15,17 August 2010
