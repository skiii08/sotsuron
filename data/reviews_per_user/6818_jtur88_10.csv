"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," Not your basic drag film
","I never bothered to rent this film, because I've seen enough La Cage Aux Folles wannabes to last a lifetime.  But when it turned up on cable and everythign else got rejected, I tried it, and I was pleasantly surprised. This film IS a delight, in some intangible ways that transcend the standard drag-queen fare.  If you're a cantankerous old straight guy (like me), try Priscilla---I think you might like it.",Null,3,6,26 April 2001
Fargo," The Southern film at the 49th parallel
","This film typifies one of my pete peeves, but on the other end of the country.  Just like most 'southern' films, with fake accents and fake body languages and fake cutesieisms, Fargo is a film about North Dakota (actually Minnesota) starring people who couldn't find Fargo on a map.  True, there aren't very many Angie Dickinsons and Lawrence Welks and Roger Marises to play the convincing parts of North Dakotans.  But this thing stinks of overblown accents, almost as badly as Jessica Lang (who is from Duluth!) stinking up the house in 'Streetcar Named Desire'.  It's embarrassing to watch `regional color' films in which parts are played by actors who have never been closer to MInnesota than listeing to 'Prairie Home Companion'.",Null,0,0,14 January 2001
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," A nice fit
","I consider comedies with trepidation, because they are so overwhelmingly likely to belong at one end or the other of the spectrum: Either not very funny at all, or so silly as to be embarrassing. Like 'Office Space', this film fits neatly into the middle of the spectrum. No pratfalls, no pies in the face, but genuinely an amusing film. I was, however, disappointed with Catherine Keener. I've long considered her among my favorite actors, but maybe she is getting lazy or spoiled. She just doesn't have the sizzle that I had gotten used to. But then, who does, ten or twenty pictures into their career? I had trouble with character believability in this movie, too. The ending musical scenes were formulaic, and one of the worst examples I've ever seen of that formula.",6,0,0,24 December 2005
Saving Private Ryan," Don't. Pick out 'Thin Red Line'
","If you're going to the video store tonight to pick out a war film, go a little further to the right in the aisle and pick out 'The Thin Red Line', which is a thoughtful representation of war for intelligent people.  Saving Private Ryan is not.  SPR is little more than a USA flag-waver, with a powerful dose of America's other national anthem: Brutal bloody violence in the name of God and Country.'Thin Red Line' is a much much much much much better film, and any intelligence you have will not be insulted by it.",Null,1,2,27 January 2001
28 Days Later...," Terrible
","SPOILERS, as if the director didn't already spoil it. If this picture ran on MST3K, the Robots would have been left speechless. Not since Ed Wood's days have I seen a picture that lined up so many improbably events.  A virus that can completely take over a huyman body in 10 seconds.  Jet planes arriving from somewhere that radio signals cannot be transmitted from.  An emergency sheet-sewing job on a hand-operated machine that turned out absolutely perfect uniform block-letters.  Red dresses belonging to the lady of the house, that perfectly fit two women whose height differential was at least a foot. Wait---driving into a TUNNEL in a land where any dark place is certain to be full of infected?  And keep on going in spite of obstacles highly likely to disable the car?  And replacing the wheel in dire peril, instead of driving out on the flat?  Come on! The hospital scene, where Jim wakes up (after a month in a coma, with full body strength!)  Fully lit corridors, in the interior of a large building, where no exterior light could have penetrated, with no electrical power. These are just a few inconsistencies that occurred to me the next day.",Null,0,0,6 November 2003
No Man's Land," Very easy way out.
","(SPOILER) I hate movies in which the solution is so obvious to any member of the audience, but the whole thing plods on as it is a difficult problem, and even remains unresolved at the end. All one had to do was slide his hand under the guys body, locate the mine, and put his hand over the plunger so it doesn't detonate. It might be necessary to remove a couple of those small rocks. Then the body could get up and walk away while the plunger was held down, and the mine could then be jammed into the framework of the structure in such a way that would hold the plunger down. Tie a long cord to the mine, get a safe distance away, and jerk it out of the tight spot, allowing it to detonate harmlessly. It took me about two minutes to figure that out, and it embarrasses me that it took that long except that I was distracted by the other inanities of the film, which were numerous, including the keystone cops failure to secure other weapons lying around. Yet the whole picture revolves around everybody, including a famous German mine disposal expert, being baffled by this simple conundrum. Furthermore, there is no way on earth that the last guy to leave the scene would have done so, with a living person simply abandoned to his fate. Sorry, just a horribly, horribly contrived movie.",1,11,32,30 December 2008
The Insider," Great film!
","I'm just getting around tothis one on cable.  It has almost no flaws.  Great script, talent, imaginative but not distracting camera.  I thought Pacino was a little bit too Pacino for the part, but my wife says she's heard interviews with Lowell and it's right on.  It's long, but I never looked at the clock once.  I can't think of a single frame that ought to be cut in the interest of brevity. This is a must-see for any intelligent, thinking film-goer.",10,0,0,23 July 2001
A Beautiful Mind," Just not a good film (poss. spoiler)
","I wanted to say pretty much what marija-trost said.  Thanks for putting it so well. I cannot remember ever being so disapppointed by a film that was recommended by someone I respected the opinions of.  It was just plain old Hollywood playing follow-the-dots. I cannot imagine this picture bearing any more than the slightest veneer of similarity to the actual life of Nash.  It was 'Love Story' in a Princeton setting.  Compopunded by the fact that there was absolutely no effort to even pay lip service to the concept of Character Development.  Who was this guy?  I understand why there was no character development of Parcher! Maybe they thought Anybody's character development would be a spoiler, since some characters didn't have any.  Pretty weak excuse, though, for bad film making.",Null,0,1,8 July 2002
Jackie Brown," My Top Ten, All-time!
","I love this movie.  It has everything.  I can't get enough of it.  I loved the slow, gentle pace of the film, long periods of thoughtful silence. Scenes of violence disposed of summarily.  Incredibly beautiful, loveable leading lady.  Complicated events in the twisting plot.  Perfect cast, each one as good as ever.  I'm speechless.",10,0,3,31 December 2000
Windtalkers," Dreadful.
","This is the film for you if you are in one of the two following categories: 1--Tired of slasher films because there are too many bloodless gaps, 2--You raise pit-bulls and train them to attack children. Even if you're one of the above, you will probably be weary after about the 50-th scene of a blazing body flying through the air in slow-motion.  I'm sure I saw several scenes repeated---even John Woo got tired of shooting this stuff.",1,2,4,14 December 2002
