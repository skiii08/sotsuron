Ghost," This was a very good film
","This story had it all - comedy, heartbreak, love and very good elements besides such as the murder plot which was very well done, but there could've been a few more suspects to choose from and since we're already down to two to begin with - Willy and Carl, there's no real surprise when it transpires that Carl is in league with Willy and they murdered Sam, or at least conspired to. But it's never really made clear whether Sam was accidentally killed.Excellent performances all round - not just Whoopi - though the bank scene where she realizes she's going to get $4 million is just one of the highlights of the film. Of course, with any film, there's going to be some dull points. However, they are kept to a minimum and as this film, like many others, is almost unbelievable some of the time, it still doesn't bore and makes for entertaining filming for two hours. Sometimes the acting is weak but most of the time its good.The film contains some rather strong violence in places so I wouldn't recommend this film to people with a nervous disposition. However, if you want a good film that's not at all bad, then Ghost is my choice. Perhaps the ending was not quite believable enough - though I won't give it away here. See the film and judge for yourself. Perhaps some of the film also is too quickly executed - such as Whoopi's rather quick appearance -- though later we do miss Whoopi because the film does drag quite a bit between scenes without Whoopi. Goldwyn makes a good villain as does the actor who plays Willy. It's still a good film, definitely 8 out of 10 from me.",Null,1,2,5 September 2001
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Excellent Film, Good Graphics, Decent Night In, Satisfied!
","That's one way to describe this piece of material that Cameron has provided - having helmed such films previously like Aliens, it's not difficult to predict that this might be a likeable film - but it proceeds to show us that it is much better than what we might have first thought of as a likeable film. Basically, two terminators are sent back through time. Arnold Schwarzenegger's role is massively extended in this one - giving us more reason to like the film. Hamilton is truly great as Sarah Connor. She gives a very real performance. Sadly, the scene with Michael Biehn was cut from the final print (tell me why!) Robert Patrick comes over as an ice cold villain with absolutely no mercy (except maybe in 1 part.) His termination raises a cheer after he devestates Arnie's metallic body in the steel factory at the end. Furlong's performance could've been better. However, he does have one or two good scenes, but in the more powerful scenes, he has trouble performing the emotions. This was a truly great film. My only worry now is that Terminator 3 and Terminator 4 will be as good as the prequels -- I'm starting to have my doubts.But let's wait and see. It might be a lot better than we expect. This vehicle certainly was. JC deserves a pat on the back...as does Schwarzenegger and the entire crew for making a great film.",10,1,1,7 September 2001
The Wizard of Oz," Just one thing... This IS the film that truly deserves recognition
","I really enjoyed this film. However, young children should be wary of this film. Margaret Hamilton IS VERY scary as the wicked witch. Also, one might argue that there is a bit of rather unpleasant speech for young kids to be subjected to near the end when the wicked witch has the final confrontation with the witch. However, it's still a good film and one that definitely will stick around for a long time to come yet. Robin",10,1,2,4 November 2001
