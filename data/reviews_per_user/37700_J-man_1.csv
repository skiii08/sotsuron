The Blair Witch Project," Great!!!!
","Blair Witch is one great movie. Yeah, it was filmed with a hand held camera and the actors basically had no script but they were afraid and nervous during the filming. This was one of the most realistic movies I've seen to date (except for Pvt. Ryan...) If you've never been in the woods, alone, scared and hearing scary noises..you won't get the feeling of this movie. Oh yeah...for the 18 and under crowd...in about 15 years some yahoo will remake this movie and add the sex, violence and the big, scary, hairy, computer generated monster you want to see. (Just look at the remake of Psycho and The Haunting)",Null,0,1,22 October 1999
