Come and See," A beautiful and Painful film
","This is one of the first films that truly shocked and scared me, as it is really terrifying in its plain brutality and stark portrayal of the second world war from a very human perspective. The shell shock scenes are some of the most poignant that I can remember seeing.An excellent but harrowing film, highly recommended.",9,4,7,4 February 2001
Unbreakable," Very disappointing from a plot perspective
","Unbreakable is a film that pushes the limits of plausible plot lines, and in doing so tries far too hard to make itself sensible, when it is dealing with what is essentially a ridiculous idea. Don't take it that I dislike the genre of fantasy (I loved X-Men), but I like it to be visibly so, without pretencions of psychological depth and insight, this simply felt extremely underwhelming.Even though the film is very disappointing from a plot perspective, the camerawork is impressive in general with several particularly nice shots (especially through the billowing curtains in the bedroom scene). Bruce Willis is reasonable as the brooding David, basically re-enacting the role from the sixth sense, of a man with an uncertain past needing to participate in a voyage of self discovery before he can realize his destiny.It lulled me into a sense of expectation from trailers, posters and the Sixth Sense, which it then unfortunately betrayed by being a film that was shallow and unengaging. I expected an intelligent thriller with an interesting twist but got a very slow, pretentious comic book.",4,0,0,2 January 2001
