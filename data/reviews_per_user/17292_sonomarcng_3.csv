Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Better than I remembered
","A lot of entertainment and memorable moments. It has some low points too, but definitely a movie with more good than bad for a Star Wars fan. You get a few Jedi battles, multiple character introductions, and a view at pre-empire life. All of those help make Star Wars a bigger better movie universe.",6,0,1,12 May 2020
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Just not good!
","Rewatching all the Star Wars movie before 9 and I remembered not liking this one, but was hoping with me being older I could appreciate it more. Sadly, this is still not good. The first hour should have been an extra paragraph in the opening text crawl for as boring as it was. I do appreciate that the movie is showing the steps needed for Palpatine to become emperor, but the script is so boring at conveying this information. The last half action adds a little excitement but it's not enough to pull the movie out of the dumpster. And watching Anakin and Padme's relationship develop was more unbelievable than I remembered.",3,0,2,13 May 2020
Parasite," Not seeing the appeal.
","If you like to watch movies for escapism and finding entertainment and optimism then don't watch this. I can't say it's poorly made, acted, or written, but I couldn't relate or care about anyone in the movie or anything that was going on.",4,0,1,12 May 2020
