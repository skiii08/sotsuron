First Man," You will be the First Man out of the theatre at the end
","For a movie about one of the most challenging and daring feats in human history this movie was incredibly dull and boring. If Neil Armstrong was have as dull in real life as portrayed in this then why didn't they make the movie about Buzz Aldrin. I feel as though the movie had an ending in mind with regards to Neil Armstrong's personal moment on the moon and then tried to make a movie around this all in the hope of baiting an Oscar.The actual moon landing scene itself is excellent with an excellent score, it's just let down an by the rest of the movie.",5,2,5,9 March 2019
Captain Marvel," Overall a very average movie
","Just an average entry in the MCU, a very very slow starts leads to a decent climax however Brie Larson never excels in the role and is upstaged by the 'cat'.I also find it unfair that almost every male in the movie is portrayed as either stupid or a sexist pig, whether it's her father, fellow pilots or just a random biker.",4,1,2,9 March 2019
The Favourite," Great performance from Olivia Coleman in a dull movie
","My headline sums up how I felt about the movie, great performances all round in what amounts to a movie that was quite slow and left me feeling empty inside at the end",5,1,6,9 March 2019
Wonder Woman," Absolutely amazing
","The movie is really good, not just inspiring for women and girls but boys and men too. I will happily admit moments made me shed a tear just at the pure selflessness of the character.",9,12,22,9 March 2019
