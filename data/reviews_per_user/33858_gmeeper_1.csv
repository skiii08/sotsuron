The New World," Forget a second look...not worth a first.
","This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. Maybe that's because I was expecting a historical action movie (like The Patriot or Braveheart). This turned out to be more like one of those bizarre Estee Lauder commercials.Over 60% of the movie is in voice overs. A typical scene from the movie has the couple (Ferrell/Kilcher or Bale/Kilcher) running/working in an open field asking questions like 'Where are you my love?' or 'How will I know if you love me?' Even for an romantic film it was crappy. The remainder of the movie that is not voiced over is whispered, spoken with thick accents, or in Native American dialects (with no subtitles) that make it nearly impossible to hear. One of the few American films that actually should have had subtitles.The film was so weird that when it ended no one in the theater said a word. Usually there is some chatter/discussion while exiting. Not here. Everyone just got up and left quietly. It was like leaving a funeral home.Bottom line -- don't waste your money or time unless you're punishing yourself for something.",1,6,16,23 January 2006
