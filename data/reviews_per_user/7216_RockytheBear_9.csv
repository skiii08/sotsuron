Ali," Floats like a tank and stings like a banana...
","ALL MY REVIEWS CONTAIN SPOILERS.  EVERY ONE OF THEM.
Will Smith playing Muhammad Ali makes about as much sense as a solar powered flashlight.  There are so many other actors who could portray Ali better than Smith: Ving Rhames, Morris Chestnut, or Kirsten Dunst.  Muhammad Ali's entire career and legacy was over before I was even born, so all my knowledge on one of history's greatest figures came strictly from books, television and word of mouth.  I eagerly anticipated the movie, but wasn't looking forward to Will Smith.What the movie is, specifically, is frozen crap on a stick.  Michael Mann was obviously high off uncut sawdust during production, because this dung fest of a movie doesn't even try.  Just look at the horrific opening sequence, when Ali trains to the credits.  The movie rapidly whizzes through his humble beginnings, which are the most important elements of a biography movie, especially one featuring a larger than life character.  We never even meet Cassius Clay; the movie begins with him already as Ali.  We never learn what life was like for him as a kid growing up, we never learn how he hooked up with The Nation Of Islam, hell-- we never even learn how he got into boxing.  What were his motivations?  Who were his inspirations?  We meet Ali's dad for all of 2 seconds (he's about 8 years older than Ali, by the way.)  And Bundini Brown's character, played by Jamie Foxx, is introduced out of nowhere.  When you watch the movie, just take note at how rapid the first 30 minutes of the movie are.  The film just plain sucks.And when the movie finally does slow down, it sloooowwws down-- and stretches out the insignificant parts of Ali's life and rushes over the important ones.  Did we really need all that Malcolm X junk?  Didn't Spike Lee already make that movie?  And didn't Spike Lee also play Sam Cooke's 'A Change Is Gonna Come' when Malcolm was killed?  And shouldn't Michael Mann be getting a summons in the mail from Spike any day now?  Also, check out how Muhammad Ali's wives come and go.  They just pop on the screen without warning, nor introduction, and as soon as you realize what's going on, they have vanished, as if David Blaine stepped in as director.
As for Will's acting, it should not be praised.  Everybody in the cast does a better job acting than he does, including Jeffrey Wright as photographer Howard Bingham.  In this movie, Bingham barely has 2 lines, he just repeatedly (and repeatedly) takes snapshots and smiles (okay, he's a photographer, we get it!!!)  Will Smith's southern accent comes and goes, and gets hilarious early on in the movie.  Instead of Ali, he sounds a lot like Snagglepuss.  He even says 'Exit, stage left,' but that scene was cut from the movie.  Jon Voight was nominated for an Oscar for playing Alfred E. Newman.  And I sincerely believe Jamie Foxx may hold the title as the world's least funny funnyman, and in this movie he shamelessly steals George Carlin's famous joke of how he never had a 10, but one night had five 2's.There is another part where Ali goes to Africa to face George Foreman in the famous 'Rumble in the Jungle' match.  Michael Mann decides he wants to show Will Smith running for 7 hours, surrounded by screaming young fans.  This scene goes on and on, and by the time it was over, I was shocked to notice I had gray hair and a receding hairline.  Thanks a lot Michael Mann, I missed about 25 years of life.This movie is terrible and was a big disappointment.  If you want to watch a good movie about boxing, I suggest you rent D.C. Cab, Leprechaun, or Jack Frost.  These films are all great and at least you'll be able to follow what's going on.  They all have characters you will care about and feel sympathy for.  Ali has none of these elements, and if you happen to watch it while you're in your 60's, you just might wake up dead once it's over.* star out of 5.",4,3,6,26 July 2003
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Steaming crap on wheels...
","ALL MY REVIEWS CONTAIN SPOILERS.  EVERY ONE OF THEM.
Screw E.T.  Why is this movie praised so much?  It's pure garbage.  ET is an a**hole.  Why?  Because he was out in the forest lolly-gaggin' when his superiors were calling him back to his ship.  He was careless and missed the boat!  Simple as that.  And instead of being a man and paying the price for his own mistakes, he lays this guilt trip on all us humans and begs us to help him get back home.  Now it's our problem.  What a jerk!  Sorry, ET but I got my own problems.  What were you doing out there in the woods anyway? Probably devising some elaborate alien conspiracy that will baffle the minds of millions of society's greatest analysts for the next thousand generations.  I DO NOT TRUST ALIENS.  Period.And once he gets here, look what he does.  He makes Elliot (the only one who loved him) sick.  So sick, in fact, he is near death.  If ET can touch a flower and bring it back to life, why doesn't he touch the boy who is doing his best to help him???  Elliot is really bustin' his ass for this punk alien.  He's telling his mother boldface lies, he is missing days at school, he becomes a part time wino, he gets a police rap sheet, quarantined from his neighborhood, then chased and shot at by the FBI.  All for this ingrate named ET, who never even gives so much as a thank you.  This is the thanks I get?  I DO NOT TRUST ALIENS.I purchased the ET Scholastic book when I was in 2nd grade.  There, it stated that ET is 300 light years away from his home.  I don't think people realize how far that is.  A light year is the distance the speed of light travels during the course of 1 year.  The speed of light is 186,000 miles per second.  Now there are 86,400 seconds in just one day, which means the distance of the speed of light is 148,800,000,000 miles in a day.  This number multiplied by the number of days in a year (365) brings us to 54,312,000,000,000.  This is the distance light travels (in miles) in just one year.  I repeat ONE year.  Now then, ET is 300 light years away from his home planet?  Fine.  There are 109,500 days in 300 years.  Which means the total mileage of how far ET's home from Earth is 10,346,436,000,000,000,000. I know these are all just mind numbing figures to you, so to put it in greater perspective, ET had to begin his journey to Earth about 10 trillion years before the first dinosaur was created in order to get here by 1982, the year of the movie's release.  And Elliot made contact with his home with a friggin' Speak-N-Spell.This movie is so stupid.  How ET even has the balls to ask his homies to COME BACK and get him a second time is beyond me.  The speed of sound is even slower than light, so Elliot should have been about 20 trillion years old before the aliens even GOT the signal.  Then another approximate 47 trillion years later (not counting rest stops and space tolls) before they actually arrive to get ET.  Elliot would be an old man by the time they got back.As for the movie itself, it introduces some of the dumbest characters I have ever seen in a movie.  During Halloween, the kids throw a sheet over ET and Dee Wallace doesn't even notice her own child is a foot shorter and her head's 10 pounds heavier.  Then when they go trick or treating, ET mistakes a kid dressed as Yoda as one of his hometown natives.  How stupid is this alien?  He's smart enough to learn English in 2 hours but can't tell a kid in a costume.  Yoda's from Dagobah, for Christ's sake!  He looks nothing like ET.  Even I can tell the difference and I've never even been to Dagobah.  ET must be the Rain Man of his planet.  The more I watch the movie, the more I realize how autistic ET is.  He even enjoyed it when Drew Barrymore had her way with him and turned him into a cross dresser.I really like the end sequence when all the kids put masks over their faces during the big FBI chase.  Is Spielberg that stingy with his money that he couldn't afford stunt look alikes?  So instead he'll save a buck by hiding their faces so we can't see them, but never mind the fact that each kid grows 2 feet taller and 20 pounds heavier.  And after they all fly, how corny was their landing?  Perfect formation, BMX style!  Hahaha!  It looked like a deleted scene from that movie Rad.So, yes, ET is a bad movie.  Crap special effects, crap acting, crap story. It wasn't even half as good as Mac and Me.  ET is not fun for the entire family, as most believe it to be.  Fun for the whole family is a movie like Animal House.  Kids like d*ck and fart jokes, trust me.  Not some kid hugging a nightmare inducing creature with his heart pumpin' on the outside. How scary was that?  I tell, you, one day the sequel will come out and you will all see I was right.  ET is evil.  Just like every other alien in every other movie.  After Close Encounters, Independence Day, and V.....I DO NOT TRUST ALIENS.Zero stars out of 5.",6,8,15,7 July 2003
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Just garbage...
","ALL MY REVIEWS HAVE SPOILERS.  EVERY ONE OF THEM.
Terminator 3 defies logic on so many levels. First of all, I have the same initial question with T-3 that I did with T-2. Why the hell does the future John Connor (or military personnel) continue to send old, obsolete model cyborgs to save him in the past? Wouldn't it make sense to send the same updated, slicker model that was sent to kill him? And why does the female T-X pump up her clevage to flirt with a cop? Isn't she the Terminator?? Why does she need tricks to get his gun? Just JACK HIM FOR IT like you do everything else!  Speaking of the cop's gun, why does she even need it?? Her arm can shape into a gun, a rocket launcher, and a flame thrower.  And why does she need to taste a bloody woman and bloody gauze pad to identify people?  Isn't her tongue made from the same synthetic material her finger is?  She should taste it as soon as she sticks her finger in it. She also murders a guy in a drive thru burger joint, but the window is on the right hand side.  Why?  Isn't this America??  And what happened to her mission to destroy John Connor's future lieutenants?  She abandons that idea early on and decides to pursue John Connor and his future wife for the duration of the movie.  The ending is anti-climatic.  So anti-climatic in fact, I don't even remember how they destroyed the female Terminator in the end.T-3 is a poor movie with a convoluted plot, uneven pacing, and boring action.  The film in general feels small and incomplete.  It ends with a door open for a sequel, but my anticipation is greater for Problem Child 9. Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is simply garbage and anyone who likes it is stupid.  Zero stars out of 5.",Null,0,0,5 July 2003
28 Days Later...," No, it's not a movie about PMS
","ALL MY REVIEWS HAVE SPOILERS.  EVERY ONE OF THEM.
Any movie with a monkey is a friend of mine.  Some of my favorite movies include: Project X, Monkey Shines, and Every Which Way But Loose.  You just can't go wrong with a monkey in your movie.  The only thing funnier than a monkey is a barrel of them.  Hell, even the WORD monkey is funny.  So I am sure you can imagine my delight when this film OPENED with ATTACKING MONKEYS!!Some animal activist group with the IQ of baked velvet break into a science lab and decide to free all the chimps.  But we quickly learn that the animals are infected with a rage virus (how they could even say that line without laughing is beyond me) that makes them stark raving mad.  We then cut to 28 Days Later (oh, I get it now) where we see a bicycle messenger named Jim waking up from a 4 week coma.  Why he was butt naked I have no idea.  Perhaps his doctor was Larry Drake.  He then realizes he is the only man left in London, and he walks around shouting 'Hellooooo' for quite some time.  I must admit I enjoyed these early scenes, they were mysteriously creepy.  That is, until Jim stumbles upon a church full of zombies, who must have been searching for salvation.  He is then rescued by some rough and tough zombie killers who update him on the last 4 weeks.Then after about 45 minutes, I realized something horrible.  The monkeys were not coming back.  I waited and waited, but yep-- they were gone for good.  I hadn't been this disappointed since that movie 12 Monkeys deceived the world by not having ONE monkey!The other problem I had with 28 Days Later was the fact that you can't see anything.  The movie looks like it was shot on a freakin' View Master, therefore even the daytime shots look dark.  Zombies come and go, but the action is so dark and frantic, you can't see anything!  Another thing that defies logic: There is a charcter named Selina who is tough as nails in the beginning of the movie, but in one day softens up so much, she lets any military man have his way with her.  She doesn't even TRY to fight anymore! Michelle Rodriguez would never have stood for that.  Jim then snaps 'Lord of the Flies style' and becomes a one man killing machine.  Not only does he kill zombies, but he kills highly skilled and trained military personnel including a Major.  At least I think he was a Major.  Oh, who cares, he was weak anyway.  The movie also tempts us with nudity, but it never arrives. Oh wait, I take that back.  We do get to see a nude zombie for all the necropheliacs in the audience.  Oh yeah...one last thing that makes this movie so bad.  It sucks!  They should change the title to $18 Dollars Later. That's right.  I actually took a date with me and ended up wasting $18 dollars; not counting popcorn and my traditional pre-movie arcade game ritual.* * out of 5.",Null,0,0,5 July 2003
Coyote Ugly," Uglier than you think...
","ALL MY REVIEWS CONTAIN SPOILERS.  EVERY ONE OF THEM.
Whenever I am discussing Tyra Banks, the woman I plan to marry, to other women, without fail, they immediately begin to sip on a tall bottle of Hatorade and dis the hell out of her.  I've heard it all:  She's phony, her forehead is too big, her breasts are man made; all statements in which Rocky the Bear does not care.  My latest Tyra complaint however, intrigued me somewhat.  I was arguing with a girl, a post sex tradition for me, and when she realized she couldn't change my mind regarding my feelings towards the famed Victoria Secrets model, she scraped the bottom of the barrel and said, '...And what the hell does Coyote Ugly mean anyway??'At first, I didn't know she was serious, but when I began to ask around, I noticed many women did not know what this phrase meant.  Maybe because it's a guy thing.  Coyote Ugly is a bar or club term, used to define 'a stranger in your bed, particularly one who was fine as hell last night, but in the morning is coyote ugly.'  The kind of chick who is so disgusting, you'd rather gnaw your arm off than wake her up, in the same fashion a coyote gnaws off his leg, if caught in a trap.  Ladies who aren't familiar with this term are probably the same ones who wake up in the morning with a lone bicep under their necks.Sharp readers out there will probably notice how I am discussing other issues, and not the movie.  I am doing it on purpose.  I am saving you the time, and saving myself the embarrassment of admitting that I actually sat through this travesty of a flick; a flick that not even T&A could save, if you could imagine that.  What happens when you mix a half pint of Cocktail, add two cups of Flashdance, and a shot of Fast Forward?  Actually, you get nothing, but when you stick an umbrella in it, it instantly becomes 'Coyote Ugly.'  Fine a*s Piper Perabo plays 'Violet,' a New Jersey girl who moves to New York City with dreams of becoming a songwriter.  Everyone in Manhattan treats her like a complete outsider, as if Jersey is on the other side of the earth, and not 40 miles away.  Okay, on second thought, I can understand that.  But what I can't understand is how when she moves to a dump in Chinatown, we do not see a single Chinese person.After no luck with the music biz, she auditions for a job at a bar named Coyote Ugly.  Three girls work there already, including Zoe, the token, brilliantly played by Tyra Banks.  Zoe is leaving the bar in one week, to go to law school.  This is completely understandable because she only makes a measley 300 bucks a night at the bar (or 78k a year.)  Violet takes her spot as a Coyote, and then the 80s pop era of film, which I thought was dead, begins.  The bar itself is handled very realistically.  Why?  Because the bartenders perform choreographed routines on the bar, as if in a music video.  The NYC fire marshal frequents the bar regularly, yet never shuts it down-- even though every night the place is 100 people over maximum capacity.  Bartenders spit fire balls at the crowd, and on some occasions, light the bar itself on fire for no reason.The film is one cliche after another, including the following scenes: boy meets girl, girl hates boy, boy shows 'stalker persistence' so naturally girl begins to like boy, boy and girl have an opening up discussion on the hood of a car overlooking Manhattan's skyline, girl has fight with over protective dad, girl has fight with boy, girl loses job, girl makes up with over protective dad, girl makes up with boy, girl even gets her job back, girl makes it big in the music biz, girl meets LeAnn Rimes.There.  You've just seen the whole movie, but chances are you've seen this same movie dozens of times before this one even came out.  My only surprise of the film was Jerry Bruckheimer's name in the credits as a producer.  He truly is the hardest working man in Hollywood.  Or the most desperate.

8 Mile," A musical that forgot to add music...
","ALL MY REVIEWS CONTAIN SPOILERS.  EVERY ONE OF THEM.
What I am talking about is the fact that 8 Mile may be the first movie I have ever seen with no musical score.  Scenes are painfully quiet, and have no background instrumentals to keep us company.  Trust me, the dialogue is not that compelling, so the lack of music is definitely noticeable.  What else is noticeable is the fact that Eminem has about as much screen presence as the Key Grip credit in the end of the movie.  As an actor, he has 3 ranges: Mad, madder, and sorta mad.  Just watch the scenes when he gets angry and snaps on people.  It's some of the funniest work you'll ever see from an 'actor.'How can a movie about the greatest form of music be so bad?  There is no such thing as a bad rap movie.  Even the bad ones are good!!  I love Krush Groove, Beat Street, CB4, and Rappin'.  Okay, maybe not Rappin'...but you guys get my point.  It's a fool proof topic that can't fail.  But 8 Mile does, and fails miserably at best.  I also don't appreciate how 8 Mile tried to deceive me.  This is a low budget independent movie, disguised as a major Hollywood production.  They do a sneaky good job hiding the fact that the film has no score by filling every scene with a soundtrack song from somebody's album.  And although the songs they chose are great, this movie cannot fool Rocky the Bear.It starts with Eminem playing-- you guessed it, a rapper-- named B. Rabbit. The B stands for 'Bunny.'  That's right folks...Bunny.  And he actually thinks it's because he's white that people make fun of him.  The film opens with him in the bathroom of a Detroit nightclub, all alone, rehearsing his rhymes.  Ladies and gentlemen, I go to clubs routinely and I have never seen a vacant bathroom once.  Anyway, he is involved in a rap battle, he chokes on the mic and is booed off stage.  Hilarity ensues.  He leaves the club, eyeballing his number one nemesis, Papa Doc, the Clubber Lang of MC's. Bunny Rabbit then goes home to his mom's trailer where we get an awesome shot of a naked body double we're supposed to believe is Kim Basinger. Basinger, playing his mom, speaks in southern hillbilly dialect, the same way most Detroiters do.Nothing is right in Bunny Rabbit's life.  He works at what everyone calls a dead end job (personally, I thought he had a very good job) and he has just broken up with his girlfriend and moved out their house, and back with Moms and live in boyfriend.  Kim Basinger without question agrees to take Bunny Rabbit in (how realistic) and of course, the rest of the movie becomes Bunny vs. Boyfriend.  Eminem is one dead actor.  Sometimes I wondered if he was actually present during the movie, or did they just use still photographs of him and animate his mouth, Clutch Cargo style.  One funny thing he does repeatedly is get angry at Boyfriend, cuss him out and threaten him, then in 2 seconds turns into Mr. friggin' Rogers and grabs his little sister and showers her with over-affectionate baby talk.  In one scene even serenades her.  Very creepy; it's probably the scene that secured the R rating.8 Mile, or as I like to call it, 'Riding Around In Cars With Boys' is one boring snoozefest of a movie.  Every scene entails Bunny Rabbit riding around in different cars with his boys.  After a while, it becomes painful to endure, and I made the decision that I'd rather use gravel as eyedrops than to watch another frame.  And to make matters worse, while I was in the theater, this strange smell would not leave my area, so I had to sit there in my seat, continually smelling this God awful aroma.  Then I looked up at the screen and realized it was 8 Mile I was smelling.Bunny Rabbit hangs with the wackest crew in crew history.  It's leader is a guy named Future, which is actually Mekhi Phifer with a brown mop on his head we're supposed to believe are dreads.  Next up is the Farrakhan of the group, Angry Boy X.  Angry Boy X is one of Hollywood's latest stereotypes they've been doing since Zebrahead.  There's also a big fat boy for comic relief (fat boys are always funny) and a true loser named Cheddar who's slightly retarded.  Watch the sensitive scene where Bunny Rabbit visits him after he is shot.  Cheddar actually tells Rabbit, 'I-- I just don't want them making fun of me.'  Oh, boo hoo.  I thought they were going to kiss.Oh yeah, the movie also stars Brittany 'I'll Never Tell' Murphy, playing what else-- a slut.  Early in the movie, the gang set an abandoned building on fire, I think they were trying to make some Detroit public service announcement.  Unfortunately, Bunny Rabbit makes it out the building alive. He then walks over to Brittany, who's watching the fire she actually says this line: 'It's almost beautiful.'  I hate when movies feel obligated to include that mushy mumbo jumbo and force out lines like 'It's almost beautiful.'  These days anybody can be a director, the only requirement is a heartbeat.Eminem also looks really weird in this movie.  For the most part, he keeps a hat on, I guess to hide his thinning hair.  When he does take it off, he looks like a chemo patient you feel sorry for.  As for the movie itself, it's so boring!  It's like watching an ABC After School Special with no message at the end.  No message because after the big rap showdown at the end, Bunny Rabbit beats his nemesis, but does he get a record deal and become famous?  NO.  He goes back to work!!  What the hell did I even watch this crap for?!I've even read lots of professional critics hail this movie, and compare it to Purple Rain-- like that's a good thing.  That's like telling a new mayor he reminds you of Marion Barry.  8 Mile is basically bad scene after bad scene.  Eminem gets into a fight with his mom's boyfriend, Eminem gets into a fight with a rival rap group, Eminem gets into a fight with his old girlfriend, Eminem gets into a fight with his new girlfriend, Eminem gets into a fight with his best friend, Eminem gets into a fight with a rap promoter, and then Eminem befriends a gay guy??  Hey, YOU try to make sense out of this movie.  I gave up on the lunch truck scene.  Pure crap.Zero stars out of 5.",4,1,4,15 July 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," Let's talk for 3 hours and call it Matrix Reloaded...
","ALL MY REVIEWS CONTAIN SPOILERS.  EVERY ONE OF THEM.
Not only do I hate The Matrix movies, I hate people who like the Matrix movies.  Yes, reader this means you, too.  You people make me sick.  And the ones who try to make The Matrix this deep, emotional, philosophical, metaphorical, conceptual 'experience' are even dumber than the Wachowski Bros.  At least they are smart enough to steal your money!  You all, on the other hand, are dumb enough to see this movie repeatedly for  more hidden meanings, when there is nothing to witness but mindless dialogue jargan disguised as Bible truth.The first Matrix, although better than part 2, did not impress me.  I had already seen the 'suspended animation' effect twice before its release. You know the effect I'm talking about: when somebody jumps in the air, freezes, and the camera slowly pans around their entire body.  Once in Lost in Space, the other in Wing Commander.  By the time The Matrix used it, that effect was old to me.  But Matrix gets all of the credit.  I didn't care about Neo, I didn't care about Trinity, I didn't care about the machines, I didn't care about the Miss Cleo lady, but most of all, I did not care about Morpheus. I hate him so much I hope he turns out to be a machine in part 3, or better yet, hopefully he'll drop dead in part 3.  But I will never know because I will never see part 3.  The Wachowski's have already stolen my money twice. A third time will make me just downright stupid.The Matrix Reloaded likes to talk.  And it likes to talk down to us as well. Each character has a 50 minute soliloquy that must be delivered before we continue onto the next scene.  If they're not talking, they are dancing 'Club Mtv' style underground for about 35 minutes.  This makes a lot of sense: 'People, there is no hope for the world, the machines are gonna take over, and we're all gonna die.  But first...WE DANCE!!'  How long was this scene!  My god!There is another scene where Neo talks to Miss Cleo again for 55 minutes. They talk and they talk and they talk...and during this conversation, two things are happening.  One: the writers lay the dialogue on so thick to hide the illusion that the screenplay doesn't make sense.  Two: all the 13-18 year olds will see the movie again and again to catch everything.  And three: intelligent, and rational individuals like myself are wondering where we can go to watch some paint dry.  Ya know, some real entertainment. Neo then breaks out into a fight with Agent Smith to the hundredth power, and this is the best scene in the movie.  Not because it is exciting, but because it is hilariously phony.  Neo will be fighting, and then out of nowhere will turn into a cartoon on your a*s, giving you the shock of your life.  You heard me.  A CARTOON.  All I needed was an X-Box controller in my hand to complete the scene.  Then, he would jump back to Keanu Reeves for the close-ups.  Then he would fight some more, and then turn into a complete cartoon on your a*s all over again.  This scene by the way is 42 minutes.I like when Neo, who you can now call Superman, flies through the air, with one fist extended.  I guess he forgot his name is KEANU Reeves, not Christopher Reeves.  At one point, he even flies high above the clouds and pointlessly does this gay little pose before deciding to come back down. What kinda self-gratifying move is that?  Don't you have people to save? Get to it!Then, a bunch of other crap happens.  We meet some unexplained French dude, we meet some unexplained ghost guys, we meet some unexplained Keymaster (didn't we meet him in Ghostbusters?)  and then we meet The Architect. Yeah, let's talk about The Architect.  Neo goes into this room that resembles Circuit City and talks to a man in a chair who looks like Colonel Sanders.  The Architect then proceeds to talk down to us, the audience for a very long time.  He even starts his speech with 'You will not understand what the hell I am about to say.'  That means even the writers couldn't even handle this whopper.  The Architect scene clocks in at a full one hour, 13 minutes and represents the climax of the movie.The final scene of the movie comes out of nowhere, makes no sense and has the entire audience yelling 'Huh???'  but I was already saying that long before.  For all the geeky Matrix fans who claim I 'don't get it' my argument is, 'Yes I do!!'  I got it during the first Matrix, there was no reason other than money to expound on the topic.  I got it when I wrote a similar story myself back in high school!!  I got it when I first read philosophy books by Plato and Socrates in junior high!!  It's YOU guys who don't get it!  What you don't get is...The Matrix is DUMB, and you are too! Go watch a REAL hero movie!  Like Smokey and the Bandit 2.

Before Sunrise," Hell on Earth...
","ALL MY REVIEWS CONTAIN SPOILERS.  EVERY ONE OF THEM.
I've always considered myself a reasonable man.  If a movie isn't chock-full of nudity, sure, I may be p***ed, but at least give me wall to wall violence.  If the movie isn't overflowing with blood, I may be disappointed, but at least give me some form of conflict.  I'm a big fan of chaos, confusion, and disorder; in reality as well as in the movies.  To put it plainly...DRAMA.  Movies do not need comedy to work, nor horror, nor sex-- but DRAMA is a necessity.  It is an absolute must.  And what's the definition of drama?  Conflict of some kind.  Before Sunrise is the only movie known to mankind with no drama.Before you applaud the film's originality, understand this: ABSOLUTELY NOTHING HAPPENS DURING THE COURSE OF THE ENTIRE MOVIE.  Let me repeat that. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING HAPPENS DURING THE COURSE OF THE ENTIRE MOVIE.  When I say nothing, I mean NOTHING.  Trust me, reader I understand movies don't all have to have warehouse explosions, truck explosions, and people explosions (that would be Utopia) but at least have something happen!!!  This movie is hardcore proof that hell exists.  Because here is a 2 hour slice of it. I do not see how Satan can run his underground operation without including this movie in some way.Yes, we want our movies to be true to life.  But not at entertainment's expense.  And don't gimme that 'Oh, how interesting and realistic this film was' crap either.  My own personal life on any given day is more interesting than this movie!!  If I wake up puking from last night's beer escapade, at least that's SOMETHING.  And I don't wanna hear that 'It's a chick flick, guys won't get it' crap either.  The chick I was watching it with was BEGGING me to turn it off, but I am stubborn and I can never let a movie beat me.The movie stars Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy.  Here is the plot:  Two people, one whom you can't even understand, talk for 2 hours.  Period.  That's it. They never argue.  No one bothers them.  There isn't even conflict in the general conversation!  And you people call this realistic??  Guys, you mean to tell me it is possible to chat with a woman without wondering 'What the hell is she even talking about?'  I think not.  And women, you mean to tell me it is possible to meet a man who is so sensitive and understanding to your needs that he just wants to 'listen' without any thought of reward for his troubles?  Yeah, keep dreaming.  And keep watching these Hollywood romance movies.See, here is the difference between how men and women watch movies.  A guy can watch Bruce Willis run through a building barefoot and take on a dozen terrorists all by himself and dismiss it as the sheer entertainment of a movie.  We know this will never happen, and if we find ourselves in that situation, we will be the first ones to run away screaming and looking for a phone to dial 911.  But women can't seem to differentiate movie from reality.  Especially when it comes to these Hollywood romances.  So let me tell you women a few things...1.) Men and women do NOT meet by crashing their cars together at a red light and exchanging phone numbers!  Every time I've ever been in a car wreck, whether male or female, I had to prepare for a fight.2.) If he starts off perfect at first, unlike television, he will not end that way, too.  You wanna know why he started nice?  He wants the panties!! This is not Quantum physics here!  I thought you ladies were the smarter of the 2 genders.  It sure doesn't seem like it.  And if you're waiting for your own personal Ben Affleck, Luke Wilson, or Matthew McConaughey to come and sweep you off your feet, guess what?  Even THEY are the same way. They are only playing characters in a movie!  That's why they call it ACTING. It's all pretend!!3.) No man will ever, and I mean EVER, propose to you on the screen of a Jumbo-Tron at a baseball game.  What man would risk that type of possible embarrassment?  Not only that, no man wants the world (especially other ladies) to see that he has officially become a fool by taking himself off the open market.  Ladies, be grateful he even proposes!  If he does it on an answering machine, email, or through Morse code, thank your lucky stars every day of your life.After suffering through the nonsense called Before Sunrise, you'd think the director would have the common curtesy to thank the audience by AT LEAST showing a sex scene, right?  Wrong.  The sex is done off camera.  I mean, what is this movie even trying to prove???  After about 45 minutes, I mean, it's not even funny anymore.  Something has GOT to happen!  But it doesn't. It goes on and on, with no resolution.  Then on top of that, it ends like there will be a sequel.  Not in my life time.  I never thought movies could get worse than Magnolia, but this one wins with flying colors.  Before Sunrise is the absolute worst movie of all time.Zero stars out of 5.",10,1,10,12 July 2003
Identity," From the makers of Jack Frost...
","ALL MY REVIEWS CONTAIN SPOILERS.  EVERY ONE OF THEM.
Identity is a rug snatcher.  This is a phrase I made up but will soon lose credit for now that it's been made public.  Anyway, it defines a movie that deliberately tries to snatch the rug out from under your feet, just for the sake of messing with your head.  Just when you think you know the movie, A-ha!  SNATCH!  It isn't what it seems, is it, silly audience member? Boy, are we Hollywood writers smart!!This technique was done well with The Usual Suspects, but since then, it has erupted into almost a Hollywood tradition.  The Sixth Sense, The Game, Planet of the Apes, Fight Club, Wild Things, The Others, and now Identity are all rug snatchers.  A Nightmare on Elm Street 6 was also a rug snatcher, because who would have ever thought Freddy would have actually died?Identity is also stupid.  One of my strict movie rules I follow:  Never trust a movie that begins on a dark and stormy night.  The film is about 10 strangers who all meet up to spend the night in a motel and end up getting bumped off one by one.  A woman is hit by a car and is hurt badly through most of the movie.  Her husband and weirdo son tend to her wounds.  John Cusack plays a limo driver who used to be a cop.  And Rebecca DeMornay, who has been visiting the tasty cakes section too often, plays a snobby ex movie star.  I can't believe this is the same woman who played the hot hooker in Risky Business.  I think she alone is the reason this film is called Identity.  Try to guess who she is.Anyway, the film starts off well.  The characters are introduced in a fairly original way and the tension builds to a great premise.  Then...A-ha! SNATCH!  The writers give up and snatch the rug from under us and flips our whole world upside down.  The movie gives us a twist on top of the original twist, because once we learn the 10 characters are all the same guy (from Natural Born Killers) we then have to figure out which fake personality did all the fake killing.  Like we even care at this point.  I mean, it's all fake.  The movie even cheats in this aspect, because they purposely leave out huge details and clues to prevent the audience from trying to figure things out.  Well, isn't that the definition of a mystery?  Figuring out clues?  God, I hate a stupid movie.I had good intentions for Identity because its writer, Michael Cooney, also wrote a brilliant movie called Jack Frost.  No, not the happy Michael Keaton version.  I'm talking about the REAL Jack Frost-- the original.  The one that was snubbed at the Oscars.  The one about a killer snowman who terrorizes a small down with his big teeth and deadly ice cycles that shoot like bullets.But now, he's gone from genius to commercial and brings us this crap on a stick called Identity.  Movies that start off well and end crappy piss me off more than movies that are crappy from jump.  At least the 100% crappy movies don't lie and mislead us.  But the ones that start well build our anticipation with false hope.  That's like the Prom Queen inviting you to her bedroom...to read Tolstoy.* out of 5.",Null,0,0,5 July 2003
