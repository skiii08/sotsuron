The Devil's Advocate," Diabolical
","This movie begins with a talented criminal lawyer named 'Kevin Lomax' (Keanu Reeves) defending an accused child molester in a Florida courtroom. Although he becomes convinced that his client is guilty he decides to win the case in spite of it all. After he does a man from a law firm in New York appears and offers him a deal to go there and assist them in selecting a jury for a specific trial. When the jury votes to acquit he is then invited to meet the man who owns the law firm who goes by the name of 'John Milton' (Al Pacino). But just as Kevin Lomax is no ordinary lawyer, John Milton is no ordinary man--and he has a deal for Kevin that is extremely tempting. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that I thought this was an exciting movie for the most part with good performances from Keanu Reeves, Al Pacino, Charlize Theron (as 'Mary Ann Lomax') and Connie Nielsen ('Christabella Andreoli'). However, there were some parts which could have used some improvement along with the ending which seemed a bit too convenient in my opinion. Additionally, there was quite a bit of profanity and nudity which some viewers might need to know beforehand as well. Even so, I enjoyed this film and I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",7,0,1,7 February 2017
Moneyball," A Good Baseball Story
","I've always been partial to a good baseball movie and this one certainly fits that category. Essentially, this story is about a small-market team (the Oakland Athletics) which cannot compete with teams like the New York Yankees who are willing to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on the best players around. Recognizing this the general manager, 'Billy Beane' (Brad Pitt) hires an unknown adviser named 'Peter Brand' (Jonah Hill) from the Cleveland Indians who specializes on finding undervalued talent. Against severe criticism from his scouts and coaching staff they deliberately bypass well known players in search of inexpensive athletes who have been largely overlooked in the process. At any rate, rather than give the story away I will just say that this film does a fine job in showcasing the risk that Billy Beane took to stay competitive. I thought both Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill did excellent jobs in their respective roles. However, I would have liked to have seen more baseball and less of the personal drama in Billy Beane's life as it took away from the overall feel of the movie. But in any case this was a good movie that should appeal to those who like a good baseball story.",6,0,0,17 January 2013
Whip It," Lost Its Focus
","All of her life 'Bliss Cavendar' (Ellen Page) has been pressured by her strong-willed mother to be a beauty pageant winner. She pretty much accepts this primarily because she doesn't really have any other options. Then one day she sees a roller derby game and suddenly knows what she wants to do and subsequently tries out for a team—and makes it. From then on she secretly devotes herself solely to the game and to her new boyfriend 'Oliver' (Landon Pigg). Now rather than reveal any more of this movie and risk spoiling it for those who haven't seen it I will just say that what starts out with good doses of comedy and action suddenly morphs into a drama (around the midway point) and it's at this time that the film lost its focus and cutting edge. Additionally, although Kristen Wigg (as 'Maggie Mayhem') seemed to breathe some life into this movie, her comedic talents weren't utilized nearly enough. Same thing with Ari Graynor ('Eva Destruction'). In summation, this movie had some good potential but the director (Drew Barrymore) failed to take advantage of it and as a result I rate it as only average.",5,2,4,21 August 2015
The Avengers," Extremely Uneven
","This is one of those movies that has both good points and bad points. For starters, I thought 'Iron Man' (Robert Downey Jr.) and 'the Hulk' (Mark Ruffalo) were absolutely sensational. Likewise, most of the other characters were well played too. On the flip-side though the introduction of 'Hawkeye' (Jeremy Renner) was terribly planned and presented. Not only was the character development badly mishandled but the fact that this person got so much screen time when there were others with much better credentials just boggles the mind. Not only that but his costume-or basic lack thereof-also stuck out like a sore thumb. Additionally, although I liked the CGI I thought it and the non-stop action were just too overwhelming. Even more important was the fact that there were too many characters and not enough film to go around between them. This made the film look extremely uneven. Too many cooks do indeed spoil the soup. Be that as it may, this movie should have been very good but in all frankness it turned out to be a jumbled mess. All things considered then I think the really good points were dragged down by the lack of direction which resulted in a very mediocre film. Accordingly, I rate it as only average.",5,4,9,24 December 2013
Angels & Demons," A Secret Society with a Devilish Plan
","This film essentially begins in at a Swiss laboratory with scientists producing three canister of the highly explosive compound known as anti-matter. Not long afterward, however, one of the scientists is murdered and a canister is stolen. Meanwhile, in Rome, it is reported that Pope Pius XVI has died and upon his burial a papal conclave gathers to select a new one. But just prior to this solemn event, four of the most influential cardinals are kidnapped with clues pointing to a secret organization known as the Illuminati as the likely suspect-and their plan is to destroy the Vatican using the stolen canister of anti-matter. To prevent this the Vatican sends a secret envoy to Harvard to enlist the help of 'Professor Robert Langdon' (Tom Hanks) who specializes in ancient symbology and might be able to decipher some of the clues left behind by the Illuminati. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that, although this sequel to 'The Da Vinci Code' had more action, the conspiracy theories were even more absurd than in the original film and this tended to weaken the overall story rather than strengthening it. That being said, while this wasn't a terrible film by any means, it wasn't something a person could take seriously and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Average.",5,0,1,14 November 2019
The Monuments Men," Art for Art's Sake
","Due to the initial success of the Nazi war effort in France, Poland and other European countries certain art enthusiasts get together and offer a plan to the President of the United States to build a small military unit to go to the front lines and recover all of the valuable paintings and sculptures they can before they are shipped off to Germany. Naturally, with the overall victory over Germany and Italy still in doubt there aren't many resources available to them and the task at hand is extremely dangerous as well. However, their efforts are rewarded to a certain degree when a man named 'Frank Stokes' (George Clooney) is given the authority to assemble a squad to carry out the mission. To that effect, he gathers various art collectors and enthusiasts that he can trust and together they venture into France, Belgium and even Germany in order to acquire the treasures before the Germans can hide or destroy them. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an interesting film in large part because it was based on a true story. Having said that, however, I must admit that there were some scenes that seemed a bit contrived and unrealistic. Be that as it may, that's not to say that I necessarily disliked this film and all things considered I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",6,1,2,5 November 2017
Mission: Impossible III," An Unlucky Rabbit's Foot
","Even though he is retired from actual field work, 'Ethan Hunt' (Tom Cruise) is asked to join an IMF team on a mission to rescue a colleague named 'Lindsey Farris' (Keri Russell) who has been kidnapped by an international arms dealer by the name of 'Owen Davian' (Philip Seymour Hoffman). At first the mission is a great success as they not only extricate Lindsey but also take a couple of badly damaged laptops with them as well. Unfortunately, Lindsey dies not long afterward due to a small explosive device implanted in her brain and there is some doubt as to whether the IMF will be able to retrieve any information on the laptops. Needless to say, the IMF director 'Theodore Brassel' (Laurence Fishburne) is not very happy with the outcome and lets all of the agents involved in the mission know about it. Fortunately, one small piece of information is gleaned from the corrupted disk drive on one of the laptops which reveals that Owen is scheduled for a meeting in Rome and it's at this time that a top-secret mission is launched to capture him alive. However, what Ethan doesn't realize is that there is a traitor within the IMF organization and things are going to become exceedingly difficult for him not long afterward. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this turned out to be an exciting film with plenty of action and suspense all the way through. Tom Cruise gave an excellent performance and having three beautiful actresses in Michelle Monaghan (as 'Julia'), Maggie Q ('Zhen Lei') and the aforementioned Keri Russell certainly didn't hurt. In short, I thought this was an entertaining movie and I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",7,1,1,9 February 2017
Lucky Number Slevin," The Kansas City Shuffle
","A new criminal organization has decided to move into New York City. When they discover that a horse has been doped without their knowledge or permission they decide to set an example by killing everyone who knew about it. Fast forward about 20 years and a young man on his way back to New York City is killed by an assassin utilizing a version of 'the Kansas City Shuffle'. In other words, he gets the victim to look one way while he is coming from another direction. The thing about this maneuver is that it can happen to anybody. That said, this movie will take you in all kinds of directions and just when you think you understand what is going on something else transpires that changes everything. And while there were several big name actors involved in this movie, I thought Josh Hartnett ('Sleven Kelevra'), Morgan Freeman ('The Boss') and to a lesser extent Lucy Liu ('Lindsey') really stood out the most. Definitely worth a look if you enjoy a good crime-drama-mystery type of film. But just remember, the 'Kansas City Shuffle' can happen to anybody.",7,0,1,22 January 2013
The Equalizer," The Vigilante Versus the Russian Mob
","'Robert McCall' (Denzel Washington) is a mild-mannered clerk who works at a home improvement store during the day and frequents a quiet diner to read a book at night. Although they are not friends he sometimes talks to a young prostitute named 'Alina' (Chloe Grace Moretz) who takes a casual interest in some of the books he reads. One night he notices that she has a black eye and decides to walk with her a little bit and provide her whatever advice he can offer. Suddenly a car comes out of nowhere and two men get out and order her to get inside. Since she refuses Robert's help he watches as she gets in the car and the men drive off. A day or two later he is told that she is in the intensive care unit where she is recovering from a severe beating. He then decides to visit the establishment where the two men work and it's at this point that things become really interesting. Now, although this movie apparently suffers from mixed reviews, I personally thought that it was rather good. I especially liked the 'vigilante versus the Russian mob' storyline and the excellent performance of Denzel Washington. In any case, although some scenes were clearly a bit unrealistic I still enjoyed this movie and I have rated it accordingly.",8,0,3,29 March 2015
Source Code," Manages to Entertain All the Way Through
","'Captain Colter Stevens' (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a helicopter pilot who finds himself on a train under another person's identity by the name of 'Sean Fentress' and he is looking for a person who has already blown it up. If that isn't strange enough, he also has only 8 minutes to find the man responsible, otherwise he has to go back and search again in order to stop a 'dirty bomb' from exploding in downtown Chicago. Now, while all of this might sound confusing, the different scenarios actually dovetail into a very imaginative film. Jake Gyllenhaal turns in a fine performance as does Michelle Monaghan as his female friend 'Christina Warren'. And while there isn't much action and the suspense is low-key for the most part, this movie still manages to entertain all the way through. All things considered then, I thought this was a very enjoyable film and I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",7,1,3,3 March 2013
Iron Man 3," A Notch Above the Preceding 'Iron Man' Movies
","'Tony Stark' (Robert Downey Jr.) is having some severe traumatic difficulties stemming from his recent combat experience depicted in 'The Avengers'. Unfortunately, he doesn't have time to resolve these issues because a terrorist by the name of 'the Mandarin' (Ben Kingsley) is targeting him, his wife 'Pepper Potts' (Gwyneth Paltrow) and 'President Ellis' (William Sadler). Not only that but he has also earned the enmity of a mad scientist by the name of 'Aldrich Killian' (Guy Pearce). Now, not wanting to spoil the film for those who haven't seen it I will just say that there are some twists involved which deviate from the original plot and serve this movie quite well. Having said that let me also state that I am not a big fan of action movies that consist of simply action and CGI. And while this film has plenty of both there is also some good acting on the part of Robert Downey Jr. and Guy Pearce. Additionally, there is a good story to be had here too. Be that as it may, I would like to advise those who haven't seen this movie to see 'The Avengers' or possibly one of the other two 'Iron Man' films before watching this one if for no other reason than to have a little bit of continuity. That's not to say that this movie can't be enjoyed on its own because it certainly can. In any case, I believe this sequel was a notch above the preceding 'Iron Man' movies and I have rated it accordingly.",8,16,25,26 December 2013
Resident Evil: Afterlife," The Same Thing Over and Over Again
","I'm not sure the director (Paul S. Anderson) knows exactly where he wants to go artistically or how to handle this movie. The film begins with a great opening sequence in Tokyo but rather than delving deep into what could have been something very intriguing, he decides to shift to action, stunts, and CGI and continues until a certain scene involving a plane crash. Now, as if all of the action and unrealistic stunts weren't enough, it seems that both passengers also manage to survive. Apparently plausibility or any sense of realism doesn't matter as long as there is plenty of action. And that's been part of the problem since 'Resident Evil-Apocalypse' two films earlier. Rather than taking what he has and utilizing it in a sober manner he constantly chooses to go overboard in the mistaken assumption that 'more is better' regardless of how absurd it eventually gets to be. As a result, we get dozens of clones of 'Alice' (Milla Jovovich) along with the original Alice possessing telekinetic superpowers. It's simply all too much. Fortunately, he realized this and took care of both of those problems at the very beginning of the movie. But then he turns around and does what could be the exact same thing again at the very end. I don't know, maybe it's just me but it seems like the same thing over and over again. Lots of action and CGI with a couple of pretty faces thrown in for good measure. Anything to distract the viewer from realizing that this film has no real thought or creativity behind it. Now don't get me wrong, I like the inclusion of 'Claire Redfield' (Ali Larter) and 'K-Mart' (Spencer Locke). But rather than have them just thrashing around looking pretty I would have preferred that they be given meatier roles with more character development. After all, it seemed to work in the last film ('Resident Evil-Extermination') pretty well and to great effect. But failing any great effort on the director's part, I guess we will have to settle for lots of action in its place. And that's a shame because this movie should have been much better.",5,3,4,20 January 2013
Casablanca," One of the Best Films Ever Made
","With the Nazis having already occupied France and conquered much of Eastern Europe, a stream of refugees desperately attempt to get to America by embarking on a tortuous path which includes getting to the small city of Casablanca in French Morocco and from there to Lisbon. However, as difficult as it is for these refugees to actually get to Casablanca, their travel is further complicated by the fact that nobody is allowed to take the daily flight from there to Lisbon without the written permission of the corrupt Vichy French police commander by the name of 'Captain Louis Renault' (Claude Rains). So quite often these refugees have to wait for quite a long time and this-in and of itself-creates even more of a financial and logistical hardship upon them. So in an effort to find a solution to their problem or temporarily forget about their troubles, many of them flock to the most popular nightclub there known as 'Rick's Café Americain' which is owned by a tough and worldly American expatriot named 'Rick Blaine' (Humphrey Bogart). Yet, even though he is quite successful in Casablanca, he finds it hard to find any great happiness due to a previous romance which devastated him a year and a half earlier. However, things take a sudden turn for the worse when a famous anti-German activist named 'Victor Laszlo' (Paul Henreid) walks into his nightclub-and with him is the woman who broke his heart that bleak and rainy day in Paris. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this is not only my favorite movie of all time but is also considered to be one of the best films ever made with a number of movie stars possibly turning in the best performances of their careers. I especially liked the chemistry between Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman (as 'Ilsa Lund') along with the performance of Dooley Wilson as Rick's loyal companion 'Sam'. Be that as it may, I believe that this is one of the very few films that each and every viewer ought to see at least once and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. A classic in every sense of the word.",10,2,2,15 September 2019
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Very Imaginative
","Hired to find out the reason a cartoon actor named 'Roger Rabbit' (voice of Charles Fleischer) is not performing in his usual manner, a private detective named 'Eddie Valiant' (Bob Hoskins) discovers that Roger's wife 'Jessica Rabbit' (voice of Kathleen Turner) has been 'playing pattycake' with a human by the name of 'Marvin Acme' (Stubby Kaye). However, not long after the incriminating photos are shown to Roger, Stubby just happens to die a violent death-and everybody suspects it was Roger who did it. Everyone that is, except Jessica who tells Eddie that the entire affair was a setup and that she isn't a bad person but that she was simply 'drawn that way'. Although not totally convinced that Jessica is as innocent as she claims, something doesn't seem quite right to Eddie and as a result he decides investigate a little deeper. But what he doesn't realize is just how dangerous his quest for the truth will eventually become. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a very imaginative picture which made excellent use of portraying real actors next to a host of cartoon characters. Very imaginative indeed. Likewise, there is also a certain amount of mystery mixed in with the cartoonish atmosphere as well. That being said, I thought that this was an entertaining film and I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",7,0,0,30 June 2019
G.I. Jane," Feminist Propaganda
","This movie is proof that in Hollywood all things are possible. I say this because it was quite obvious that whoever wrote this film obviously had one goal in mind and that was to present a political opinion that pandered to a certain audience without regard to actual reality. But bending reality completely out of shape has been a trend for a long time in Hollywood and since it sells tickets I imagine it will continue for some time to come. That said, I suppose I shouldn't argue with success regardless of how silly the story gets. At any rate, Demi Moore plays 'Navy Lieutenant Jordan O'Neill' who has applied for SEAL training but has been turned down. She laments that because some of her male counterparts have succeeded that they are being promoted ahead of her. Apparently there are no other tough courses in the entire Navy for her to excel. Fortunately, as luck would have it 'Senator Lillian DeHaven' (Anne Bancroft) also laments the fact that women aren't given equal opportunities in the Navy and so Lt. Jordan O'Neill suddenly has her big chance. Quite naturally, she not only survives the course (which has many men falling by the wayside due to the physical and mental strain) but she also becomes the leader of her squad due solely to her will to succeed. Not only that, but she is so extraordinary that we see her helping men through the obstacle course along with rejecting all 'gender norms' as well. Naturally, towards the end of the film she even manages to save her instructor 'Master Chief John James Urgayle' (Viggo Mortensen) while on assignment in Libya. Again, only in Hollywood. Now, normally I would rate a film as ridiculous as this the worst possible score. But it does have some good action scenes and I like Demi Moore. But even so, unless you really need some laughs, totally enjoy feminist propaganda or are completely naive, I wouldn't bother with this one.",2,9,18,24 February 2013
Training Day," Street Justice
","With his hopes for one day making detective firmly in mind, a young Los Angeles cop by the name of 'Jake Hoyt' (Ethan Hawke) is excited about his new transfer to the narcotics division. To assist in his training he is accompanied by the man in charge of the division, 'Detective Alonzo Harris' (Denzel Washington) who shows him the ropes for the first 24 hours. During this time he quickly learns that the rules he has been taught at the police academy do not apply and that his life is in jeopardy if he fails to adapt. He also learns that there is another sort of justice other than that rendered by the courtsâ€”street justice. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was movie offers a no-holds-barred glimpse at the 'war on drugs' and gang activity from the perspective of those living in the eye of the storm--and it isn't very pretty. The movie, on the other hand, was certainly entertaining enough with Denzel Washington performing in an excellent manner as did Ethan Hawke to a lesser extent. That said, I have rated the movie accordingly. Above average.",7,0,0,18 February 2016
In Bruges," A Good Dose of Irony but Unnecessarily Vulgar
","Two hit men named 'Ken' (Brendon Gleeson) and 'Ray' (Colin Farrell) are sent to a small town in Belgium and told to wait for further instructions. It is then disclosed that Ray has accidentally killed a young boy in a church while in the process of killing his assigned target and this event has haunted Ray deeply. Ken fully understands and tries to console Ray the best that he can but because Ray is so neurotic it becomes quite a challenge in itself. However, things change quickly when Ken is informed by their boss, Harry (Ralph Fiennes) that his next assignment is to kill—Ray. Now, in between some beautiful scenery, a fairly interesting plot and a good dose of irony, there is more than a little profanity which some might believe gives the movie its flavor. To me it just seemed crass and vulgar which further lowered my opinion of it. Considering the high rating I am obviously in the minority but in any case I have rated this film accordingly. Below average.",4,1,5,5 December 2015
Friday Night Lights," Captures the West Texas Environment Remarkably Well
","This film centers around a high school football team in West Texas known as the Odessa-Permian Panthers who have set a standard of excellence that remains difficult for anybody else to surpass on the football field. However, with this success has come such a rabid devotion to this team by the local residents that an enormous amount of pressure is put upon everyone associated with the team in the process. So much so that the local residents and alumni not only expect a victory each and every time the team takes the field but they also demand it--or else! And this puts the new coach 'Gary Gaines' (Billy Bob Thornton) in an especially difficult postion which only gets worse after he loses his star running back 'Boobie Miles' (Derek Luke) to a season ending knee injury in the very first game. And things really get bad when he not only loses this game but another one not too long afterward. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that, although there was some artistic license taken with the historical accuracy here and there, the film follows the basic plot of the book and makes for an enjoyable movie experience overall. I especially liked the manner in which the director (Peter Berg) managed to capture the West Texas environment as vividly as he did. Be that as it may, I enjoyed this movie and recommend it to all those who might be looking for a film of this type.",7,2,2,21 March 2019
John Wick," Never Hit a Hit-Man When He's Down
","'John Wick' (Keanu Reeves) is a highly regarded hit man for the Russian mob who has gotten married and retired. Sadly, five years later his wife dies and he is overcome with grief. Anticipating the impact her death will have upon him, his wife makes one last secret arraignment and has a little puppy sent to him a few days after her funeral as a parting gift. Realizing the love behind the gift he immediately becomes attached it. However, one morning while walking down the stairs of his home he is hit on the head by a thug named 'Iosef Tarasov' (Alfie Allen) and before losing consciousness watches as it is killed in front of him. Afterward, Iosef and two other hoodlums then steal his mint '69 Mustang and leave. That afternoon these same thugs take it to a body shop to sell but the owner recognizes who it belongs to and refuses to have anything to do with them. As it turns out, Iosef is the son of a Russian mob boss by the name of 'Viggo Tarasov' (Michael Nyqvist) who becomes terribly upset at Iosef for what he has done and desperately attempts to make amends with John. Unfortunately, John refuses to talk and this results in Viggo sending a dozen men to kill him at his home. But John is waiting for them and none of them come back alive. And now it's his turn. At any rate, rather than reveal any more I will just say that I really enjoyed this particular movie and it kept me entertained from start to finish. I especially liked the performance of Keanu Reeves who essentially owned the role and provided a dominating presence throughout. In short, I thought this was a really good film and I have rated it accordingly.",8,1,4,19 January 2017
Wayne's World," Two Friends Who Share the Same Interests in Life
","'Wayne Campbell' (Mike Myers) and 'Garth Algar' (Dana Carvey) are two friends who share the same interests in life and host their own public-access television show which typically involves great humor at the expense of a guest. Then one day an advertising agent by the name of 'Benjamin Oliver' (Rob Lowe) convinces a local arcade owner named 'Noah Vanderhoff' (Brian Doyle-Murray) to sponsor the show on local television. Although Wayne and Garth like the initial money offered by Benjamin they fail to fully grasp the details of the contract and soon realize that they have surrendered all artistic control to him. If that wasn't bad enough, Wayne also discovers that Benjamin is very interested in his new girlfriend 'Cassandra' (Tia Carrere) as well--and he has no qualms about stealing her from him either. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film had good portions of enjoyable humor throughout the entire course of the movie. Unfortunately, there were also some less successful pieces of humor here and there as well. Additionally, although this film was quite refreshing when it first came out, I don't believe it has aged very well and because of that I have adjusted the rating of this movie to reflect that fact. Slightly above average.",6,0,0,1 October 2016
Star Trek," Style Over Substance
","This movie starts off with a battle in space between an unknown alien vessel and a ship from Starfleet. On the ship is a man named 'George Kirk' (Chris Hemsworth) who has been given command because the Starfleet captain has been summoned onto the alien vessel to parlay. The captain is subsequently killed and George Kirk manages to keep the enemy ship occupied while his passengers and crew attempt to evacuate by emergency shuttles. On board one of these shuttles is his wife who is giving birth while the battle rages and the father dies. The young child's name is 'James T. Kirk'. Years pass and eventually several of the characters from the original 'Star Trek' meet at Starfleet Academy. These include 'James T. Kirk' (Chris Pine), 'Mister Spock' (Zachary Quinto), 'Nyoto Uhura' (Zoe Saldana) and 'Dr. Leonard McCoy' (Karl Urban). Other characters are also introduced in the course of the movie. Now, as far as the actors were concerned I thought that each of them performed adequately with their individual characters. However, on several occasions the actors were required to perform 'out of character' and this weighed heavily upon its credibility. For example, the romantic relationship between Spock and Uhura is both unfounded and unwarranted. Another problem was the manner in which certain segments of either the television show or Star Trek movies were taken and 'made over' which created a totally different outcome or perspective than originally broadcast . An example of this would be the 'Kobayashi Maru' scenario which has Kirk acting much too cavalier--even for him. Afterward he is summoned to appear before a board of inquiry and is strongly condemned. However, in the movie 'The Wrath of Khan' he is supposedly commended for his originality. Now, I realize that this film attempts to differentiate itself from both the Star Trek television series and previous Star Trek movies. Yet at the same time it seeks to establish the characters identities in relation to the televisions series and previous movies. Apparently the makers of this film figured that the creation of a time-warp would allow them to accomplish both tasks. But in order to be successful they probably needed to be more cautious on what they wanted to change. In this case change for the sake of change wasn't really necessary. Be that as it may, I think those viewers who enjoy style over substance will probably really like this movie. Star Trek 'purists' on the other hand might have issues with it. Although I belong to the latter category, I understand that this movie is all about establishing an 'alternate reality' and sets the stage for further sequels which are intended to develop a life of their own. Because of that I suppose it deserves the benefit of the doubt. That said, I rate it as average.",5,2,2,31 December 2013
Fury," Definitely Worth a Watch
","It's April, 1945 and the war in Germany is rapidly coming to an end. However, Adolf Hitler and the Nazis refuse to surrender just yet and are putting up as much of a fierce defense as they can. This movie follows a specific tank crew as they fight their way forward against stiff resistance. Of particular concern is the fact that their Sherman tank is quite inferior to the Tiger tank of the Germans. However, the tank commander, 'Don Collier' (Brad Pitt) is both dedicated and determined and he has a well-seasoned crew serving with him. Unfortunately, after an extremely fierce battle he loses one of his men and the replacement named 'Norman Ellison' (Logan Lerman) is too young and inexperienced to handle the job right away. As a result he is not only a danger to the crew but to himself as well. Now rather than reveal any more of this film and risk ruining it for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this was a very good movie which had outstanding action and seemed realistic from start to finish. Definitely worth a watch.",8,2,6,28 December 2014
Train to Busan," Stuck on a Train with Zombies and Nowhere to Escape
","'Seok-woo' (Yoo Gong) is a fund manager who spends all of his time at the office which has subsequently damaged his marriage beyond repair. As luck would have it, however, he happens to have his young daughter 'Soo-an' (Su-an Kim) with him for a few days and to cheer her up agrees to accompany her on the morning train from Seoul to Busan to be with her mother. However, upon boarding the train they discover that a zombie apocalypse has just started in Korea and that they are trapped inside one of the passenger cars with no ability to escape. As a result the uninfected passengers are forced to band together to keep the determined zombies as bay. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a fairly solid zombie film which emphasized the ultra-fast variety in lieu of the typical slow-moving type. Because of that the action is quite brisk which initially worked quite well for the majority of the film. Unfortunately, I must admit that the non-stop action tended to become somewhat tedious after a while. Likewise, the rather poor ending didn't exactly help in that regard either. In any case, as I stated earlier this was a decent zombie movie for the most part and I have rated it accordingly. Average.",5,2,10,9 September 2017
Inglourious Basterds," Alternate Reality
","Set in occupied France during World War 2 an ingenious German SS Officer named 'Colonel Hans Landa' (Christoph Waltz) is extremely busy tracking down Jews to send to the concentration camps. And he is very successful at his job. Realizing that something needs to be done the allies form a small group of Jewish enlistees and assign 'Lieutenant Aldo Raine' (Brad Pitt) to lead them behind enemy lines to carry out guerrilla tactics and inflict as much damage upon the German army as possible. But Lt. Raine has another objective as well. Being part Apache he tells his men to collect the scalps of all those they kill to spread fear into the enemy. Now, rather than divulge the rest of the story and possibly ruin the film for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this was a very unique movie. While it has a World War 2 framework it doesn't adhere to actual history. It's definitely alternate reality. Be that as it may, I especially liked the performances of Brad Pitt and Christoph Waltz. Likewise, having three beautiful actresses in Melanie Laurent (as 'Shosanna'), Diane Kruger ('Bridget von Hammersmark') and Julie Dreyfus ('Francesca Mondino') certainly didn't hurt the film either. However, while I thought the character chosen to play 'Joseph Goebbels' (Sylvester Groth) was quite realistic, I thought Martin Wuttke wasn't nearly as credible in his role as 'Adolf Hitler'. He seemed too young and excitable. I also didn't care for the ending at all. Even so, I liked the movie overall and I rate it as slightly above average.",6,0,1,10 January 2014
Underworld," An Enjoyable Action Film
","For many centuries the vampires and werewolves (lycans) have been at war. The powerful werewolf leader, Lucian (played by Michael Sheen), is believed to be dead and the vampires conclude that the war has been successfully won. Selene (Kate Beckinsale), a member of the vampire warrior caste known as 'Death Dealers', suspects otherwise and just happens to observe lycans mysteriously following a human named Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman). A gun battle between the lycans and the Death Dealers takes place with casualties sustained by both sides. It is at this time that the vampires discover that the lycans are using special radioactive bullets which can kill them. To even the odds the vampires make bullets containing silver nitrate which can also kill the lycans. Meanwhile, the vampire named Kraven (played by Shane Brolly), has a secret and is planning to betray his coven right before they can institute an important change of leadership ceremony. Anyway, having established the basic foundation of the film I would like to say that it had more depth than I thought it would. The director (Len Wiseman) did a splendid job setting the dark and dreary mood that was just right for this particular movie. Kate Beckinsale looked awesome and played her part very well. I also thought Michael Sheen, Shane Brolly and Bill Nighy (playing the vampire 'Viktor') also turned in good performances. On the flip side though, I didn't especially care for the effort by Scott Speedman who seemed out of his league in comparison to others around him. The special effects were plentiful and if you like CGI then you will probably appreciate this film. In closing, this was an enjoyable action film and I recommend it to anybody who likes this type of movie in general or Kate Beckinsale in particular.",7,2,4,27 September 2012
Dawn of the Dead," Better in Some Ways Than Its Famous Predecessor
","Although this movie is a remake it has a few differences that make it better in some ways than its famous predecessor which goes by the same name. For starters, this movie was filmed 26 years later and it obviously has better technology at its disposal. Additionally, the first movie depended almost exclusively upon the horror aspect showcasing slow-moving zombies and relying heavily upon the gore factor. It also seemed to place a greater emphasis on character development which tended to give the audience a greater feel for the characters. This movie has fast zombies which results in plenty of action sequences. That said, viewers who enjoy an action movie will probably like this film over the older version. On the other hand, those who prefer a bit more shock and gore will almost certainly prefer the original movie. Be that as it may, I thought Ving Rhames (as the policeman named 'Kenneth') was tailor-made for this role and he performed it very well. I also liked the performances of Sarah Polley ('Ana') and Jake Weber ('Michael'). Along with that, I thought that Kim Poirier ('Monica') was absolutely gorgeous and wished that she had been given a larger role. In any case, the original movie was extremely good and even though there were some elements in it which may have been better, this remake had some improvements which I believe tended to balance things out. As a result, I rate this movie the same as I rated the original 'Dawn of the Dead'. If you like zombie movies then I think you should check this one out.",8,2,4,26 July 2014
Iron Man 2," Every Bit as Good as the First Movie
","At the end of the first movie 'Tony Stark' (Robert Downey Jr.) admits to the world that he is Iron Man. This sequel picks up where the last movie left off with a few major developments. First, a Russian physicist by the name of 'Ivan Vanko' (Mickey Rourke) sets out to avenge his father's supposed betrayal by Stark Enterprises by killing--Tony Stark. Additionally, Tony Stark's main rival in defense armaments named 'Justin Hammer' (Sam Rockwell) wants to acquire Tony Stark's technology by any means necessary in order to corner the market on Tony's invention. And if these two problems weren't bad enough there is also another problem Tony has to deal with-he is slowly dying. Anyway, rather than disclose the entire plot and risk ruining the film for those who haven't seen it I will just say that I thought this sequel was every bit as good as the first movie. Naturally, there is plenty of action and CGI but like the original movie it also brings back the humor and the same attractive actresses in Gwyneth Paltrow (as 'Pepper Potts') and Leslie Bibb ('Christine Everhart'). Along with that, Scarlett Johansson ('Natalie Rushman') also graces the screen. Likewise, both Robert Downey Jr. and Mickey Rourke put in fine performances as well. In short, I believe that if a person liked the first movie then they will probably like this one too. Above average.",7,1,3,23 December 2013
World War Z," Missing an Important Ingredient
","It started somewhere in the Far East. Soon a virus similar to rabies has hit all of the major population centers around the world with no known cure. Normal people are suddenly transformed into psychotic maniacs who attack others and spread the disease at an alarming rate. When it hits Philadelphia, 'Gerry Lane' (Brad Pitt) is pressed into service to help the United Nations find a cure. So much for the plot which has been played out numerous times in one fashion or the other. What makes this film unique is the money that was spent producing it. As such the movie boasts plenty of action, decent CGI, various locations and some good actors. Unfortunately, it's missing an important ingredient--gore. As a result it pales in comparison to other films in the zombie genre. Films like '28 Days Later' or 'Day of the Dead' for example. Now, don't get me wrong, as I said earlier it has plenty of action and it also has some good suspenseful scenes here and there. But it just didn't seem to be enough. And a person doesn't have to be a gore hound or a zombie enthusiast to recognize this. However, considering all of the money spent on positive advertising, my opinion probably won't matter when all is said and done. In short, I liked it to a degree but for the money spent to produce it I believe that it should have been much better.",5,11,24,21 June 2013
Rocky V," Down but Not Out
","After successfully defeating his formidable opponent from the Soviet Union, 'Rocky Balboa' (Sylvester Stallone) finally gets home but once there he discovers that he has suffered irreversible brain damage. To make matters even worse, he mistakenly signed a power-of-attorney which gave his accountant access to all of his money. The accountant then proceeded to lose it all on a risky real estate deal which now leaves Rocky totally broke. So after years of physical punishment brought on by the best boxers in the world, Rocky has nothing to show for it. It's at this time that a young boxer named 'Tommy Gunn' (Tommy Morrison) approaches him and asks Rocky to be his manager. Figuring he has nothing left to lose he decides to give it a shot. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this series has definitely featured some entertaining movies and I had hoped that this picture would be somewhat comparable. However, the drama wasn't nearly as pronounced and the action was also more restrained when compared to the previous movies. As a result, while I don't think this film was a bad movie, I also don't believe it had the same effect as its predecessors. Accordingly, I rate it as only average.",5,0,0,11 February 2016
Argo," Intense
","Against the backdrop of extreme anti-Americanism in Iran due to its support for the Shah, six American citizens manage to escape the American embassy and take refuge in the home of the Canadian Ambassador. The problem is that they cannot remain there for very long as eventually their identities will be revealed and they will be captured and possibly killed. So a plan is devised to send in a C.I.A. operative named 'Tony Mendez' (Ben Affleck) under the guise of a movie producer to attempt to take them out as part of the film crew. But before that can happen he has to get cooperation from some people in Hollywood to lay the groundwork for an actual movie in order to fool Iranian intelligence. At any rate, what I liked about this film is that it captures the intense anger the Iranian people had during this time without involving Islam as the main culprit. No doubt some used it as a conduit to gain political leverage and they are still doing it now. But it was the Shah--and our support for him--that was the catalyst. Even so, because of its strict religious leadership and the hatred they have for the West, I doubt that the current regime in Iran will allow its people to watch it. But that's another story entirely. Be that as it may, I enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to those who also like political dramas of this type.",6,0,0,5 December 2012
Star Trek Into Darkness," Flawed But Still Good
","This movie essentially picks up where its predecessor leaves off with the main characters having somewhat established themselves in their individual capacities. More or less. In this specific film a terrorist by the name of 'John Harrison' (Benedict Cumberbatch) has created significant destruction on earth and has fled to safety on an uninhabited part of the Klingon home world of 'Kronos'. Believing that he is about to give top secret information to the Klingons, 'Captain James T. Kirk' (Chris Pine) and his crew are sent on a top secret mission to seek out and kill John Harrison from a great distance with newly developed long range torpedoes. But things don't go as planned. At any rate, rather than disclosing what happens next and possibly ruining the movie for those who haven't seen it, I will just say that this was an interesting movie for the most part. Overrated but still interesting. As in the last movie the makers of the film choose to take segments from previous Star Trek television shows or movies and completely rearrange people and events to fit their specific story. And the use of good CGI and plentiful action manages to camouflage any discrepancies. At least for the most part. As such modern viewers will probably enjoy the film for what it appears to be-an enjoyable science-fiction movie. Those who grew up watching the original television series or the Star Trek movies from years past will probably notice the disparities and will base their overall judgment of this film accordingly. Personally, I thought it was a good movie. Flawed but still good. I rate it as slightly above average.",6,2,5,1 January 2014
Batman Returns," A Bit Too Dark, Gloomy and Bizarre
","Born so deformed that even his parents don't want him, a young baby is hurled into the sewers of Gotham City in the hope that he will die. But, incredibly enough, he is taken in by some penguins who live right there in the sewers and grows up into a repulsive creature known as 'the Penguin' (Danny DeVito). And his first action is to kidnap the wealthiest man in Gotham City by the name of 'Max Shreck' (Christopher Walken) and blackmail him into helping him rediscover his roots--or at least that's what he wants people to believe. But Max isn't the type who is easily controlled and instead attempts to manipulate him for his own evil schemes instead. At the same time Max Shreck's secretary 'Selena Kyle' (Michelle Pfeiffer) happens to stumble upon a secret file that Max has which details an illegal scheme he is planning and she ends up being thrown out of a skyscraper to her apparent death. But she is somehow revived by some stray cats and having now gone totally insane decides to take her revenge upon Max as a costumed villainess called 'the Catwoman'. Needless to say, Gotham City isn't big enough for 3 such villains and it's up to 'Batman' (Michael Keaton) to somehow save Gotham City from all of them. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that a dark and gloomy atmosphere is almost a prerequisite for a 'Batman movie'. However, this film probably went a bit too far in that department-and it got even more dark and gloomy the further on it went. Additionally, I didn't especially care for the rather bizarre ending either. Those issues aside, I thought all of the actors just mentioned performed credibly enough with Danny DeVito probably standing out the most in my opinion. Likewise, although I still believe Julie Newmar was the best actress to ever be cast as 'Catwoman', I must admit that Michelle Pfeiffer wasn't too bad. But that's just my opinion. In any case, given all of the previously mentioned good and bad points I have rated this movie accordingly. Slightly above average.",6,42,70,4 February 2017
Blade," An Average Movie
","Originally, I had high hopes for this movie. Unfortunately, it didn't live up to the hype. The plot was too predictable, the script was elementary and the special effects were downright laughable. But that was the only thing 'laughable' as there was absolutely no humor in this film either. Likewise, the acting was slightly below average as well. Wesley Snipes (playing the vampire hunter 'Blade') appeared to be 'overacting' while the rest of the cast's performance seemed routine and colorless. So, basically what I saw was a film consisting primarily of gunfire, action and martial arts. Nothing more than that really. Obviously, some people really like an action movie that has these elements. In this case, quite a few people must have liked it because it won the ASCAP Award for 'Top Box Office Film' in 1999. But that doesn't necessarily 'prove' it was a 'great' movie. All that really means is that a lot of people went to see it. And that's fine. Similarly, Wesley Snipes won the 1999 Blockbuster Entertainment Award for 'Best Actor--Horror' for this film as well. In all honesty though, I didn't see much 'horror' in this vampire picture to really get excited about. Again, just gunfire, action and martial arts. To be fair though, there is a growing number of vampire movies made these days that place a greater emphasis on action instead of horror. But, the difference between a 'great' movie and one that is just 'average' in this regard is the quality of the acting. And like I said previously, the acting wasn't that good. Now, that is not to say that this was a 'bad' film by any means. People who like action movies will probably love this one. However, if you're looking for a good horror movie then it might be best to look elsewhere. In short, this was an average movie all the way. Nothing more and nothing less.",5,2,8,9 October 2012
Creed," A Young Man Who Harbors a Secret
","'Adonis Johnson' (Michael B. Jordon) is a young man who harbors a secret that has tormented him his entire life. This anger and bitterness has led him into one violent episode after another and because of that he has turned to boxing to vent his rage. Finally, after winning his 15th consecutive fight in Tijuana he decides to focus all of his effort into the sport and tries to gain membership at a local Los Angeles gym. Unfortunately, the word is out on him and he is refused admission. So left with few other opportunities he decides to travel to Philadelphia to ask a favor of the man his father knew only too well—Rocky Balboa. Now rather than reveal any more of this movie I will just say that it definitely had its exciting moments and deserves a place in the 'Rocky' legacy. On the other hand, it also had some flaws as well. For example, it follows almost the exact same format as the first 'Rocky' movie from start to finish. Likewise, there were a couple of scenes which were simply too obvious to be believed. But having said all of that, this movie was still entertaining in its own right and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",6,0,2,10 March 2016
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," A Decent but Predictable Rom-Com
","'Andie Anderson' (Kate Hudson) is a journalist for a magazine that basically caters to a female audience. One day while helping her friend overcome a recent breakup she comes up with the idea for an article that focuses on certain mistakes some women make while dating that effectively destroy intimacy. To that end, she proposes to begin dating a complete stranger and in the process use certain tactics which are sure to cause the man to abruptly end their relationship within 10 days-and then write an article detailing everything. However, as luck would have it, she selects a man named 'Ben Barry' (Matthew McConaughey) who just happens to have a bet with his boss that he can pick up a woman at random and in 10 days have her fall madly in love with him. The end result is that no matter how hard she tries he resists all of her efforts to get him to break up with her. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that, despite a decent effort by everyone involved, the film itself ultimately ended up as a routine and predictable rom-com and I have rated it accordingly. Average.",5,0,1,26 April 2017
The Mummy," More Action than Previous Mummy Films
","While serving in the French Foreign Legion, an American by the name of 'Rick O'Connell' (Brendan Fraser) manages to survive a ferocious battle at the site of the ancient Egyptian city of Hamunaptra which had been lost under the sands of the desert for thousands of years. While there he discovers a box which contains a key of some sort. But rather than stay there and investigate any further he becomes extremely uneasy about the place and leaves the city as soon as possible. A few years later the key is stolen from him but as luck would have it the new owner, 'Evelyn Carnahan' (Rachel Weisz) comes to him while he is in prison and asks him to lead her and a small party to this lost city. Since he is about to be hanged he readily agrees if she can convince the warden, 'Gad Hassan' (Omid Djalili) to free him. Although she manages to do just that they soon find that they aren't the only ones looking to find Hamunaptra. Neither do they realize the evil presence that awaits them. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an entertaining film which was nominated for several awards, most notably in the categories of best sound and visual effects. Additionally, it was also nominated for a Saturn Award for 'Best Fantasy Film'. To that point, I should mention that--unlike most 'Mummy films' produced previously--this particular movie contains quite a bit more action than the others which diminishes the overall horror aspect to a great degree. Even so, I found this to be an enjoyable movie and I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",7,1,2,5 September 2018
Constantine," Suffered from an Uneven Plot
","'John Constantine' (Keanu Reeves) is a man who was born with a gift in which he can see angels and demons as they walk upon the earth. Regrettably, not quite prepared for this unexpected ability and with nobody he can turn to for help, he subsequently commits suicide and his soul is sent to Hell. As luck would have it, however, he is allowed to live again provided that upon his return he helps keep the delicate balance between angels and demons there on earth. In simpler terms, there can be only so many angel and demon 'half-breeds' who are allowed on earth and those who violate certain rules have to be sent back to where they came from-by deadly force. But then one day things take an immediate turn for the worse when John realizes that he may be the only person who can keep the world safe from a very powerful demon intent upon breaking the barrier and setting up his own kingdom there on earth. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film had good potential but it suffered from an uneven plot which became more bizarre and ridiculous as time went on. It's almost as if the writers had no clue about Biblical scripture or the supernatural and simply made things up as they went along. Be that as it may, in spite of the rather absurd story-line, I suppose this movie was okay for the time spent and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Average.",5,2,11,25 May 2017
X-Men," A Fun and Exciting Movie
","In the near future the evolution of mutants begins and the general public is made afraid of them through the demagoguery of a politician named 'Senator Kelly' (Bruce Davison). Because his fear tactics present a threat two separate mutant organizations form with radically different agendas. The first group wants to wage war on the human race for their hostility towards them. They are led by a man named 'Magneto' (Ian McKellen). The second group calls themselves the 'X-Men' and their leader goes by the name of 'Professor Charles Xavier' (Patrick Stewart). They seek peace through cooperation and better understanding. Soon the X-Men find themselves locked in combat with the other group in order to stop the terrorist attacks on innocent people. Anyway, rather than divulge the rest of the story let me just say that this is a fun and exciting movie which should appeal to most fans of the 'comic book' genre. I liked the performances of both Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart and it didn't hurt to have several attractive actresses like Halle Berry (as 'Storm'), Famke Janssen ('Dr. Jean Grey') and Rebecca Romjin ('Mystique) also appearing in the movie. Likewise, I appreciated the fact that this movie consisted of more than just mindless action and CGI. It was a refreshing change-of-pace considering that's all Hollywood seems capable of lately. Be that as it may, I rate this movie as above average and recommend it to those who might be interested in something of this nature.",7,0,1,3 January 2014
Thor: Ragnarok," Ample Amounts of Comedy and Action
","This movie begins with 'Thor' (Chris Hemsworth) having been captured by a giant demon named 'Surtur' (a CGI with the voice of Clancy Brown) who intends to kill him very soon. But before doing this Surtur tells Thor that his father 'Odin' (Anthony Hopkins) has mysteriously abandoned Asgard which will now allow him to fulfill the prophecy known as Ragnorok and thereby entirely destroy that vaunted realm. Fortunately, Thor manages to escape from his chains and quickly seizes the crown of Surtur--which is the main catalyst for initiating Ragnorok--and then departs before Surtur can attempt to recover it. What Thor doesn't know is that Odin is extremely ill and upon his death his powerful and extremely evil daughter 'Hela' (Cate Blanchett) will be released from imprisonment and lay claim to the throne of Asgard-which is possibly even worse than the possibility of Ragnorok ever was. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an entertaining movie which contained ample amounts of action and comedy. Unfortunately, some of the comedy seemed a bit unnecessary and the numerous subplots sometimes made it difficult to follow as well. But all in all it was an entertaining film for the most part and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",6,0,4,4 September 2018
Resident Evil: Extinction," Definitely Worth a Watch
","Having escaped from the Umbrella Corporation in the last picture, 'Alice' (Milla Jovovich) is now on her own and is riding a motorcycle in the middle of a desert wasteland somewhere in the vicinity of Nevada. On a separate journey is 'Carlos Olivera' (Oded Fehr) and 'L.J.' (Mike Epps) who have joined a caravan of survivors led by a person named 'Claire' (Ali Larter). The problem that both Alice and the caravan face is that the zombie population has grown on such a large scale that the zombies now inhabit the entire planet. There doesn't seem to be any safe place and so the only solution is to keep on moving. Because of this, and the desolate desert environment, this movie probably captures an apocalyptic scenario better than its predecessor, 'Resident Evil-Apocalypse'. The action is fast-paced and the plot is a slight improvement over the last film. And while Milla Jovovich displays good acting abilities, the addition of attractive newcomers, Spencer Locke ('K-Mart'), Ashanti ('Betty') and the previously mentioned Ali Larter certainly doesn't hurt this film. All things considered then, I believe this film is slightly better than its predecessor and as good as the original ('Resident Evil'). Definitely worth a watch if you enjoy this series.",7,1,1,7 December 2012
Midnight in Paris," The Night Life of Paris-Back in the 20's
","'Gil Pinder' (Owen Wilson) is a screenwriter in Hollywood who is in the process of writing a novel but having trouble collecting his thoughts and putting them down on paper. As it so happens, while vacationing with his fiancé 'Inez' (Rachel McAdams) he mentions that he would love to have lived in Paris back in the 1920's. Rather characteristically, his fiancé scoffs at his remark and dismisses it as romantic nonsense. What she doesn't realize is just how passionately Gil clings to the notion of living in another time. Be that as it may, one night while Inez is out enjoying the night life of Paris with another man, a car built sometime in the 20's pulls up and the people inside beckon for Gil to join them. He accepts their invitation and soon discovers that this mysterious car has transported him back in time to the exact same period that he has wished for so fervently. Not only that, but the people he meets happen to be famous artists and writers of that time who are able to help him with his novel. Now, rather than reveal any more I will just say that, even though it was nominated for 'Best Picture' at the 84th Academy Awards, I was somewhat disappointed in this movie overall. For starters, I thought that the plot was much too pretentious and the portrayal of the characters lacked the necessary depth and subtlety required. Everything was too simple and obvious. For these reasons I have rated this film accordingly. Average.",5,0,0,21 April 2017
Sleepy Hollow," Ichabod Crane vs. the Headless Horseman
","'Ichabod Crane' (Johnny Depp) is a police constable from New York City who is sent to the small town of Sleepy Hollow to investigate the murder of three people. Although he isn't superstitious and doesn't believe in ghosts or demons, he is surprised to find that all of the residents in Sleepy Hollow attribute the slayings to a 'headless horseman' who appears at night and systematically selects his victims without feeling or remorse. Needless to say, being a man of science Ichabod pays little heed to their warnings and seeks out the killer with only a teenage boy named 'Young Masbath' to help him out. Unfortunately, he is totally unprepared for what he finds. Now, rather than reveal any more I will just say that this movie wasn't too bad overall. I liked the acting of Johnny Depp and I thought the director (Tim Burton) did an excellent job capturing the spooky autumn night effect so essential for this particular story. On the other hand, I wasn't especially impressed with the acting of Christina Ricci (as 'Katrina Van Tassel') or the use of action in lieu of suspense and horror. A bit more gore might have also helped. Be that as it may, it wasn't a bad movie overall but it could have been better and I have rated it accordingly. Average.",5,1,2,13 September 2016
The Bodyguard," A Bodyguard in a Difficult Situation
","Having recently resigned from the Secret Service, a bodyguard by the name of 'Frank Farmer' (Kevin Costner) is offered a high-paying job protecting a musician by the name of 'Rachel Marron' (Whitney Houston) who has recently received several serious threats upon her life. Although initially hesitant, he eventually decides to check out the situation as a matter of courtesy and is thoroughly appalled by what he finds as not only is her security greatly inadequate for the task at hand but her carefree lifestyle makes things even more difficult. Yet, despite the fact that it goes against his better instincts, he reluctantly accepts the security position-and it's then that he discovers just how precarious the situation really is. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a decent film with an interesting plot and a nice twist at the end. Along with that, I would also like to mention that this film received several awards and nominations with most of them pertaining to the musical abilities of Whitney Houston rather than her acting abilities or that of Kevin Costner. To that point, although both of them were panned by the Razzie Awards, I personally didn't think that either of them deserved this criticism. That being said, while this certainly wasn't a great film by any means, it was still entertaining for the most part and for that reason I have rated it accordingly.

Fast & Furious 6," Some Really Ridiculous Action Scenes
","After their successful heist in Brazil which netted them $100 million dollars, 'Dominic Toretto' (Vin Diesel) and his team have dispersed all over the world to enjoy life. Then one day 'Agent Luke Hobbs' (Dwayne Johnson) appears on Dominic's doorstep and informs him that his former girlfriend, 'Letty' (Michelle Rodriguez) is very much alive and working with an infamous criminal named 'Shaw' (Luke Evans) on a mission to steal a very lethal military weapon which he can sell to the highest bidder. Wanting to prevent that at all costs Hobbs asks Dominic to reassemble his team in order to stop Shaw and in return all of them-to include Letty--will receive full pardons. Wanting very much to help Letty out Dominic agrees to his terms. But as good as Dominic's team is they soon find out that taking out Shaw and his team is much more difficult than they ever imagined. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film started out real well and definitely had the potential to be something very special. Unfortunately, the director (Justin Lin) once again got carried away and threw in some extremely preposterous stunts which ruined everything. Now I have no doubt that some viewers want action above everything else but there are others who also want some semblance of realism as well. Apparently Justin Lin doesn't understand that. Be that as it may I have rated this film accordingly. Slightly below average.",4,1,2,24 April 2017
The Expendables," Packed with Action from Start to Finish
","This movie begins with pirates seizing a ship in the Gulf of Aden and a couple of months later televising their intent to kill one of the hostages due to the failure of the ship's main company to meet their demands. Just prior to actually killing the hostage a small group of mercenaries appear and the leader named 'Barney Ross' (Sylvester Stallone) throws a bag full of money to the pirates. However, the leader of the pirates now demands more money and a firefight erupts which ends up with the death of all of the pirates along with the release of the hostages. None of the mercenaries are hurt either. Not long afterward the leader of this elite squad of mercenaries is approached by a CIA operative who goes by the name of 'Mr. Church' (Bruce Willis) and offered an assignment to kill the military leader of a small island in the Gulf of Mexico. After talking briefly with his team Barney and another member by the name of 'Lee Christmas' (Jason Statham) decide to go to the island to do a little reconnaissance first. They soon discover that this assignment won't be very easy at all. Now rather than reveal any more of this movie I will just say that it is packed with action from start to finish. So those who enjoy fast-paced action movies will probably like this film quite a bit. On the other hand, those who prefer a certain amount of realism are bound to be somewhat disappointed. Additionally, while Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham and Jet Li (as 'Yin Yang') certainly had adequate screen time, others like Arnold Schwarzenegger ('Trench Mauser'), Mickey Rourke ('Tool') and the aforementioned Bruce Willis made only cursory appearances which didn't affect the movie one way or the other. What a shame. In any case, although this movie was definitely unrealistic and lacked any depth, it was still entertaining and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",6,0,0,9 January 2016
MASH," Fairly Entertaining but I Much Preferred the Television Series
","This movie essentially begins with two surgeons named 'Hawkeye Pierce' (Donald Sutherland) and 'Duke Forrest' (Tom Skerritt) having been drafted and now reporting for duty at the 4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (MASH) somewhere in South Korea during the Korean War. As draftees neither of them particularly want to be in Korea and they certainly don't want to be in the United States Army. And their rebellious attitudes are reflected in their conduct at all times. Fortunately for them, their commander 'LTC Henry Blake' (Roger Bowen) is more than a little overwhelmed at running the hospital to take any action and relies heavily upon the advice of his company clerk 'Corporal Radar O'Reilly' (Gary Burghoff) just to get through each day. As a result, both Hawkeye and Duke-and a later arriving surgeon named 'Trapper John McIntyre' (Elliott Gould)-pretty much do anything they want. And their main desires include drinking and womanizing as much as possible. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that I liked this film and it won several notable awards to include 'Best Motion Picture' at the 1971 Golden Globes and the 'Palme d'Or' at the 1970 Cannes Film Festival. In addition it was nominated for an Academy Award for 'Best Picture' as well. High praise indeed. Having said all of this, however, my main problem with this film is that most of the main characters were just not that likable. At least, not to me. Not only that, but I didn't think they were nearly as good as those chosen to play these same characters in the subsequent television series. For example, although he was nominated for 'Best Actor' at the Golden Globes, I consider the performance of Alan Alda in the television series to be much superior to that of Donald Sutherland in this film. Same thing with Wayne Rogers as 'Trapper John McIntrye' over Elliot Gould. No contest. Likewise, I much preferred Larry Linville's television performance as 'Major Frank Burns' to that of Robert Duvall in this movie. Admittedly, Sally Kellerman did a fine job as 'Major Margaret 'Hot Lips' Houlihan' and her nomination for 'Best Supporting Actress' at both the Academy Awards and Golden Globes was well deserved. But Loretta Swit was, in my opinion, equally good in that particular role in the television series. Naturally, there was no drop-off in talent for 'Corporal Radar O'Reilly' as Gary Burghoff played this part in both the film and television series. Anyway, as I said earlier, I enjoyed this film to a certain extent but my particular concern has to do with the likeability of the main characters and the comparison of them to those in the subsequent television series. That being the case, I have rated this film accordingly.",6,1,2,21 October 2018
Alien," Horror and Science-Fiction Combined
","This film begins aboard a commercial space craft named 'The Nostromo' which is manned by a crew of seven and serves as a refinery for 20,000,000 tons of mineral ore. As the story unfolds, the spaceship was initially headed back to Earth while the crew were put into suspended animation. When they awaken they discover that they have been rerouted to another part of space in order to check out a strange message from what could be of alien origin. Although they had hoped to return to Earth on schedule, due to company policy they are required to investigate so they begrudgingly follow orders and land on a small planet while sustaining some damage to the space craft in the process. However, since the source of the transmission is nearby they decide to check it out and find an alien spaceship which contains the dead body of a strange creature with a gaping hold inside of it which appears to have imploded from within. They also discover several leathery eggs on board as well--and this is where the trouble starts. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was one of the scariest movies-and certainly the scariest science-fiction film-I have ever seen. It had a good plot, excellent suspense and a solid cast which included Tom Skerritt (as 'Dallas'), Sigourney Weaver ('Ripley'), Yaphet Kotto ('Parker') and Harry Dean Stanton ('Brett') among others. That said, those who enjoy a little science-fiction with their horror (or possibly vice-versa) might like this particular film and I have rated it accordingly. Definitely above average.",8,1,3,8 December 2017
Underworld Awakening," An Average Film in an Above Average Series
","Kate Beckinsale once again turns in an excellent performance as the Death Dealer, 'Selene'. Only this time, she teams up with a vampire named 'David' (played by Theo James), a human police detective named 'Sebastian' (Michael Ealy) and her young hybrid daughter 'Eve' (India Eisley). As our story evolves, we find that the humans have now become aware of both the lycans (werewolves) and the vampires and they have launched a massive purge to eliminate both species. After several years of fighting the humans mistakenly believe that the lycans have been totally annihilated and turn all of their focus on exterminating the vampires. But while this was going on, the lycans were secretly rebuilding their ranks and 12 years later have reentered the war on the side of neither the humans nor the vampires. They begin by seeking out Eve for experimental purposes involving genetic manipulation. But in order to capture her they must contend with Selene. Anyway, having given a basic rundown on the film, let me just say that it had some good things going for it--and some not-so-good things as well. First, this picture has a great deal of action and computer graphics which the directors (Mans Marlind and Bjorn Stein) use to keep the picture flowing at a very brisk pace. Unfortunately, there is too much action and not enough dialogue, which causes this film to seem a bit shallow. Another factor involved 'Michael' (Scott Speedman) who was noticeably 'missing in action' from this movie. Fortunately, Kate Beckinsale once again dominates this film and it is quite likely that she is the only irreplaceable person in this series. Along with that, I liked the addition of David and his presence also helped fill in any gaps that were missing due to the absence of Michael. On the other hand, I didn't care for the addition of Eve as I believe adding another 'hybrid' to the story doesn't really add anything significant to this series. Likewise, the fact that she is a 12-year old kid takes a bit off from the 'sleek and sexy' quality of past films. In short, this film had some good points, but it had some bad points too. As such, I consider this to be an average film in an above average series. Hopefully, they will realize some of these faults and return to some serious dialogue and plot the next time, instead of just relying on action and CGI to carry the film.",5,2,4,16 October 2012
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," A High-Octane Sequel
","Still adjusting to a new age and issues related to his past, 'Steve Rogers' (Chris Evans) meets another man named 'Sam Wilson' (Anthony Mackie) who has experience dealing with similar issues. Immediately after their conversation Steve is picked up by Natasha Romanoff (Scarlet Johansson) at which time they are sent on a top-secret mission to rescue hostages aboard a vessel owned by the spy agency (named 'S.H.I.E.L.D.') they work for. However, during the rescue operation Steve (aka 'Captain America') discovers that Natasha (aka 'the Black Widow') had an alternate mission assigned to her that he did not know about. Angry about not being informed Captain America confronts his boss 'Nick Fury' (Samuel L. Jackson) and after the argument he begins to question whether working for 'S.H.I.E.L.D.' is the right thing to do. What nobody realizes is that an enemy spy agency known as 'Hydra' has infiltrated their ranks and has a deadly plan to take over the entire world. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a high-octane action film which, as a sequel, is comparable to the original movie 'Captain America-The First Avenger' produced 3 years earlier. It has an interesting plot, high-quality special effects and decent acting all around. That said, I have little doubt that those who like movies of this type will enjoy this particular picture as well and I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",7,1,3,2 October 2016
Doctor Strange," Failed to Measure Up to Its Considerable Potential
","'Dr. Steven Strange' (Benedict Cumberbatch) is a highly competent neurosurgeon who has an ego that is only matched by his arrogance and basic lack of charm. But that all changes one day after a car accident causes massive damage to his hands which essentially destroys his ability to function effectively in his chosen career. So having limited success with everything that Western medicine has to offer, he travels to India in a desperate search for a holistic remedy. But when he gets there and meets with an elderly woman known as 'the Ancient One' (Tilda Swinton) he discovers more than he ever thought imaginable. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that I had looked forward to watching this movie for a long time and now that I have finally gotten around to it I must confess that I was somewhat disappointed. To be sure, this film was better in some ways than the 1978 version--if for no other reason than the improved CGI. Unfortunately, rather than concentrating on creating a film with any measure of depth, the director (Scott Derrickson) chose to take the rather lazy and uninspired route by providing--yet another--superhero film consisting of nothing but action and CGI. Make no mistake, a film of this type definitely needs CGI and action. But it shouldn't be at the expense of everything else. That said, although I don't consider this movie to be bad necessarily, I also don't believe that it achieved its considerable potential either. For that reason I have rated this film accordingly. Slightly above average.",6,1,1,11 June 2017
Pacific Rim," CGI and Action
","In the near future, dinosaur-like monsters come from beneath the Pacific Ocean and obliterate several cities on the coast. San Francisco is one of the first. These huge monsters are given the name 'Kaijus' and current military weaponry is insufficient to contain them. So the nations of the world join forces and create huge manned robots called 'Jaegers' which initially have great success against them. However, the Kaijus adapt and become more powerful and more numerous. As the Jaegers become more obsolescent a new plan is formulated which halts production of them in favor of the creation of huge walls upon the coasts of all nations. But the idea is a tremendous failure and the world is left with only a few remaining Jaegers to combat more frequent and powerful Kaijus. Now, rather than disclose the entire plot and risk spoiling the movie for those who haven't seen it, allow me to just say that fans of CGI and action will probably love this film as it has elements of both in copious amounts. Likewise, it also has an incredibly beautiful heroine named 'Mako Mori' (Rinko Kikuchi) to add to the scenery as well. Unfortunately, because of all of the attention to these special effects it seemed that everything else was secondary. What you see is what you get--CGI and action. That said, although I liked it to an extent, I would have definitely preferred more drama and suspense in place of some of the high octane action. It would have made the film a bit less tedious. As such I give this movie an average rating.",5,1,3,21 December 2013
Rocky II," Not Quite on the Same Level as Its Predecessor
","This movie begins essentially where the first film left off with both 'Rocky Balboa' (Sylvester Stallone) and 'Apollo Creed' (Carl Weathers) being taken to the hospital following their brutal match. Although neither of them initially wanted a rematch events soon overtake both of them which results in Apollo Creed basically having to challenge Rocky in order to regain the respect of the public. Rocky, on the other hand, finds that life after the match with Apollo doesn't go as planned and he soon becomes faced with mounting debts and a pregnant wife by the name of 'Adrian' (Talia Shire) to support. That said, rather than reveal any more of this movie I will just say that it pretty much followed the same pattern as the first movie except that it was even more slow and predictable. Now don't get me wrong, it wasn't a bad movie by any means. But I don't believe it was on the same level as its predecessor and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",6,0,0,31 December 2015
Ant-Man," Chosen for an Assignment of Incredible Proportions
","'Hank Pym' (Michael Douglas) is a scientist who has made a fortune on his accomplishments and has founded a corporation which allows him to continue on with a new project that involves shrinking matter. As a matter of fact, he has been so successful that he is even considering using his research on humans. And the one thing he doesn't want is for his project to fall into the wrong hands. So in order to prevent that he has kept the most important research strictly to himself. What he doesn't count on, however, is his devious assistant 'Darren Cross' (Corey Stoll) maneuvering behind his back and taking over the corporation and continuing with the same research with a goal to sell this technology to the highest bidder. Meanwhile, another man named 'Scott Lang' (Paul Rudd) has just gotten out of prison and is trying to make a new life for himself. Unfortunately, few places want to hire a former convict and in a moment of desperation he is convinced by some friends to break into the home of a wealthy man and steal all the money and jewels from the safe. But upon finally cracking the safe all Scott finds is a strange uniform and nothing else of any value. Realizing that this is rather odd Scott eventually puts on the uniform and discovers that his body has shrunk to an incredibly small size and that there are dangers all around him because of it. It's at this time that he hears a voice in his helmet which advises him on what to do next. What he doesn't know is that the voice belongs to Hank Pym and that he has been chosen for an assignment of incredible proportions. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a pretty good 'comic book' movie which contained a good mixture of both action and comedy. Admittedly, the ending was somewhat predictable but even so it still remained quite entertaining and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",7,1,1,8 September 2018
Captain America: The First Avenger," A Very Solid and Enjoyable 'Comic Book' Movie
","Following America's entry into World War 2, a small and scrawny young man by the name of 'Steve Rogers' (Chris Evans) tries desperately to enlist. Yet, despite repeated attempts he fails his physical each and every time and has to watch as his peers prepare to head out to military basic training. However, as luck would have it, a German scientist named 'Dr. Abraham Erskine' (Stanley Tucci), who has escaped from the horror of the Nazis, offers him the opportunity to potentially enhance his physical prowess by undergoing a dangerous experiment with the understanding that there is a chance he may not survive. Feeling he has nothing to really lose and everything to gain, Steve accepts wholeheartedly. Unfortunately, although the experiment is a complete success, Steve is relegated the unenvious duty of parading around in a costume and encouraging everybody to buy war bonds under the moniker of 'Captain America'. This changes, however, when Captain America is sent to the front lines to entertain the troops and discovers that his best friend, 'Bucky Barnes' (Sebastian Stan), along with a number of other American soldiers, has been captured by the Germans. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this movie was a clear improvement over the previous 'Captain America' film released in 1990. Not only was the action more pronounced but the special effects were much better as well. In short, this is was a very solid and enjoyable 'comic book' movie and I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",7,0,2,25 September 2016
The Bourne Ultimatum," Operation Blackbriar
",This movie essentially begins where the previous film 'The Bourne Supremacy' left off with Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) leaving Moscow and traveling back to Europe having given a the Deputy Director of the C.I.A. named 'Pamela Landy' (Joan Allen) a taped confession from another senior C.I.A. official of heading a secret-but highly illegal-operation code-named 'Treadstone'. Having provided Pamela with this information he also warns her to call off any further attempts on his life. What he doesn't realize is that 'Operation Treadstone' has evolved into something much more sinister code-named 'Operation Blackbriar' and that neither the Director of the C.I.A. 'Ezra Kramer' (Scott Glenn) nor the official in charge of 'Operation Blackbriar' named 'Noah Vosen' (David Strathaim) have any intention of allowing him to live and possibly jeopardizing this deadly new program. So once again Jason Bourne has no choice but to carry the fight to those responsible. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this movie had the same high-octane action as its predecessor but also seemed to flow more smoothly from one scene to another which made for a slightly better overall picture. That being the case I have rated this movie accordingly. Above average.,7,0,0,6 October 2016
Fargo," Dark Humor
","Somewhat slyly advertised as being based on a true story, a car salesman by the name of 'Jerry Lundegaard' (William H. Macy) hires two psychotic thugs named 'Carl Showalter' (Steve Buscemi) and 'Gaear Grimsrud' (Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife 'Jean Lundegaard' (Kristin Rudrud) so that his rich father-in-law 'Wade Gustafson' (Harve Presnell) can pay the ransom which will then be split between Jerry and the two kidnappers. Unfortunately, rather than being kept as secret as possible, things take a severe turn for the worse when Carl and Gaear shoot and kill several innocent bystanders in the process. And things get even more out-of-hand when a police investigator by the name of 'Marge Gunderson' (Frances McDormand) is assigned to the case. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that I didn't think much of this film the first time I saw it but after further viewings I began to appreciate the dark humor a bit more. That being said, I have rated the film accordingly. Above average.",7,2,2,27 September 2018
Predator," The Hunters Become the Hunted
","This movie begins with a helicopter carrying a unit of 6 mercenaries into Guatemala for a meeting with an American general who wants to use this group to rescue a high ranking diplomat who has been kidnapped by revolutionaries and taken to a secret jungle hideout across the border. Although the leader of the group, 'Major Alan 'Dutch' Schaefer' (Arnold Schwarzenegger) doesn't particularly like the fact that an outsider by the name of 'George Dillon' (Carl Weathers) is assigned as the leader of the team even though the two have worked together in the past. His suspicions are further raised when he learns that some of the things he was told during his initial briefing weren't necessarily accurate. However, his suspicion turns to shock when he discovers that someone-or something-is hunting his group and killing them one-by-one. Now rather than reveal too much of this movie I will just say that this was a decent science-fiction film for the most part with the action being definitely showcased above everything else. Admittedly, the suspense wasn't sharp as it could have been and the script was quite basic as well. But then, considering the cast I suppose this shouldn't come as a complete surprise. In any case, this movie was still enjoyable enough as far as action films are concerned and I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",7,0,1,23 August 2016
Nightcrawler," Draws a Moral Line in the Sand-and then Crosses It
","'Louis Bloom' (Jake Gyllenhaal) is an unemployed and narcissistic person who has resorted to stealing in the short term just to pay his bills. One night he comes across a grisly automobile accident scene and watches with stunned admiration at the way news cameraman 'Joe Loder' (Bill Paxton) films the sight. He then goes to a pawn shop and trades his stolen ten-speed for a video camcorder and becomes a freelance news cameraman himself. This in turn leads him to a television news producer named 'Nina Romina' (Rene Russo) who buys one of his clips and encourages him to continue in his new-found profession. He then becomes enamored with Nina and sets about becoming the best news photographer in Los Angeles in order to increase his wealth and to have her. Now rather than say anything more and risk ruining this film for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this was a very well-made movie which seeks to draw a moral line in the sand when it comes to how far a news camera crew is willing to go to get a shot on tape. Needless to say, Louis shows no hesitation in crossing it. At any rate, although there are some scenes which seem to be a bit slow the ending more than makes up for it and because of that I rate this movie as above average.",7,1,2,2 July 2015
Oblivion," An Effective Team
","In 2077, the earth has been ravaged by an alien race known as the 'Scavs' which has resulted in the remaining few human survivors having to relocate to the Saturn moon of Titan. To reach Titan the survivors have to get to a space station which eventually transports them. Needing fuel to stay operational, the space station has hired two technicians by the names of 'Jack Harper' (Tom Cruise) and 'Victoria Olsen' (Andrea Risebourough) to remain above Earth to maintain the fusion generators on earth and keep them safe from attack by the Scavs. Victoria operates as the communication specialist and relays orders from the space station to Jack who then flies to the surface and repairs the drones whenever they are damaged by the Scavs. Now, while Victoria and Jack manage to operate as an 'effective team' there is one slight problem with their situation. However, rather than disclose what it is and possibly ruin the film for those who haven't seen it I will just leave it at that. One thing I liked about this film was that for an action movie it still managed to contain a very intricate plot with some big surprises along the way. I also liked the performance of Tom Cruise who continues to shine in one good movie after another. This one is certainly one of those and I rate it as above average.",7,0,0,5 May 2014
Burn After Reading," One Chaotic Scene After Another
","'Osbourne Cox' (John Malkovich) is a low-level CIA analyst who is experiencing difficulties at the office in large part because of his drinking. Naturally, his poor performance hasn't gone unnoticed but rather than accept a lesser assignment and continue getting paid he decides to quit in a fit of rage. Needless to say, this doesn't make his wife 'Katie' (Tilda Swinton) very happy because his income was the only reason she has put up with him. To further complicate the situation is the fact that she is currently having an affair with an agent for the Treasury Department named 'Harry Pfarrer' (George Clooney) who she mistakenly believes is in love with her. However, before she files for divorce she decides to hack into her husbands computer and copy all the data pertaining to his finances onto a blank CD. What she doesn't know is that, in addition to his bank account numbers, she has also copied the first part of her husband's memoirs as well. Now normally this wouldn't be a big deal but when this CD is lost--and subsequently found by some employees of a local gymnasium--things get greatly convoluted after that. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this movie had some good bits and pieces here and there with the performance of Brad Pitt (as the bumbling gym employee named 'Chad Feldheimer') probably being the best. Unfortunately, in spite of the rather prominent cast, the overall film seemed more like a collection of scenes strung together which tended to give the picture a rather uneven feel overall. That being the case I have rated it accordingly. Average.",5,0,2,17 December 2016
The Bourne Identity," Recommended for Viewers who Enjoy Good Action and Suspense
","This movie begins with some fishermen in the Meditterean Sea recovering a body they see floating in the water. When they pull the unconscious man (Matt Damon) aboard the boat they realize that he is alive and has two bullet holes in his back. After treating his wounds the man awakens but doesn't know who he is or any events from his past. Fortunately, one particular piece of evidence found upon him has an account number for a bank in Zurich which the man immediately proceeds to check out when he finally gets to shore. Upon opening the bank deposit box the man discovers several passports under different names, a large stack of money in various currencies and a gun. He takes everything but the gun and decides to use the name of 'Jason Bourne' from the American passport. He then proceeds to the American embassy in Zurich and discovers that for some reason he is wanted by almost all of the law enforcement agencies in Europe and the United States. He also discovers that he is especially adept with guns and hand-to-hand combat. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that the overall story was acquired from a book (of the same title) which was written by Robert Ludlum and used in a previous mini-series in 1988 with Richard Chamberlain in the main role. Unlike the mini-series, however, this particular film has better action and more suspense which results in a slightly better movie in my opinion. It is also followed by several sequels which are quite enjoyable as well.",7,0,1,22 September 2016
Baby Driver," A Car Thief Struggling to Pay Off a Debt
","'Doc' (Kevin Spacey) is an unscrupulous criminal with an appetite for large sums of money which he satisfies by crafting elaborate robberies and then assembling a team to carry out his schemes. So when a skilled car thief by the name of 'Baby' (Ansel Elgort) steals his car containing a bag full of stolen loot, Doc is not one to simply let it slide. To that extent, Doc demands that Baby reimburse him by becoming his getaway driver on a set number of future bank heists to make up for his lost revenue. Left with few other satisfactory options, Baby agrees and anxiously awaits the day his debt will finally be paid in full. Unfortunately, in his greed Doc has become too reliant upon Baby and doesn't want to let him go so easily. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a decent action film which consisted of solid acting and a pretty good cast. It does, however, lose some momentum toward the end but even so I enjoyed this movie for the most part and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",6,0,1,4 January 2020
Man of Steel," Deviated Too Radically from the Original Story
","This movie begins on the planet of Krypton with a scientist named 'Jor-El' (Russell Crowe) warning the planet's leaders that their world is about to explode and urging them to send at least a few people out to other planets in order to preserve their race. Having ignored him in the past they refuse to heed his warnings now but before they can dismiss him a general named 'Zod' (Michael Shannon) breaks into the council chamber and after killing one of the leaders declares that he is now in charge of the entire planet. However, Jor-El manages to escape from the chamber long enough to send his young son out into the universe in a spaceship headed for Earth. Not long afterward, General Zod and his small band are captured and after being tried for murder and sedition they are all imprisoned in another dimension known as 'the Phantom Zone' which, ironically, saves them from a certain death when Krypton explodes. The film then fast-forwards to a grown man with incredible powers saving some workers on an oil platform and then disappearing out of sight. Needless to say, this scene is the initial introduction of a person who will soon be known to the entire world as 'Superman' (Henry Cavill). Now even though the CGI in this particular film gave it a significant advantage over the 'Superman' movie produced in 1978, I was terribly disappointed with the manner in which the director (Zack Snyder) chose to deviate so radically from the original story. Likewise, the action scene towards the end dragged on much too long and was totally unnecessary. Now don't get me wrong-good CGI and action definitely enhances certain films. Unfortunately, Zach Snyder typically relies too heavily upon these two features and this film suffers as a result. Be that as it may, while this movie certainly had some good points, it could have been better and I have rated it accordingly. Just slightly above average.",6,0,1,25 March 2017

Naturally, he falls back into his tough-guy routine and life continues as it was. Then one night Sandy appears and tells him that she is a student at the same high school. But rather than being pleased Danny puts on a show in front of his peers to avoid embarrassment which he immediately regrets afterwards. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a pretty good musical-comedy which earned quite a bit of money and was also nominated for an Oscar along with several Golden Globe awards as well. The dance routine at the end was also quite impressive. In any case, although I wasn't quite as overwhelmed by it as some viewers were, I still liked the film to a certain degree and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",6,0,0,1 July 2016
28 Weeks Later," An Excellent Zombie Film
","Although a sequel to '28 Days Later', this film is as good as the original and can stand on its own merits. And that says a lot. Now I fully understand that technically this isn't a zombie movie. The dead aren't brought back to life and they don't feast on the organs of their victims. At least not that I am aware of. Likewise there are some controversial aspects which some zombie films depict while others do not. For example, the speed of the 'zombies' are incredibly fast. And it definitely adds some good action to this film. Now, while some people might argue over technicalities of this nature, to me the zombie genre shouldn't be exclusive to new ideas or formats. After all, one of the chief complaints about zombie films is that everything has already been done and that there is no variety. So in that regard I consider this to be not only an excellent film but an excellent zombie film as well. It has good acting, well-developed characters, tremendous action and a very good plot. About the only flaw I saw was during the poison gas episode in which everyone in the car should have been killed. Everyone. That's just the nature of poison gas. But it made for a good action sequence so I won't complain too much. Also, the ending could have been drawn out a bit more. Even so, I thought this was a good zombie movie and I believe most zombie fans will probably agree.",7,2,3,19 December 2012
21," A Solid, Basic Crime-Drama

Now, although technically legal, counting cards is a serious issue in the casinos with equally serious consequences. So the students are taking an extreme risk and have to be extremely careful not to get caught. Anyway, that's the basic plot of the film. I thought Jim Sturgess (as 'Ben') and Kevin Spacey (as 'Professor Micky Rosa') both did creditable jobs. Likewise, I thought Lawrence Fishburne (as 'Cole Williams') performed in an adequate manner as well. Additionally, although Kate Bosworth (as 'Jill') was definitely attractive I thought the romance between her and Ben lacked passion. That said, while I enjoyed the film there was nothing really remarkable about it. In short, it was a solid, basic crime-drama worth a look if you enjoy movies of this type.",5,0,0,15 January 2013

Unfortunately, because of his gruff nature Gus and Mickey have great difficulty bridging what has long been a severely strained relationship causing a great amount of grief and heartache-especially for Mickey. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an okay film which benefited from a decent cast and the enjoyable baseball background. However, I didn't especially care for the steady amount of drama which cast a rather dark shadow over what could have been a very entertaining film. At least, that is how it seemed to me. That being said, I have rated this movie accordingly. Slightly above average.",6,0,1,9 May 2017

We then learn that Evelyn was indeed a CIA agent and is currently working in Langley, Virginia. Unfortunately, things take a definite turn for the worse right after that. Now rather than reveal any more of this movie and risk spoiling it for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this was an action film from start to finish. It had a good plot and I liked the acting of Angelina Jolie. On the other hand, I must also admit that there were several scenes that were simply too far-fetched which ended up totally straining credibility. Likewise the ending was much too abrupt as well. That said I rate the movie as just slightly above average.",6,2,3,26 February 2015

Although he is making the transition from amateur to professional, Drago isn't a typical athlete. Instead, he is a product of both legal and illegal scientific enhancements that have made him into a super-fighting machine capable of destroying anybody who gets into the ring with him. And he wants to prove just how great he is by fighting the heavyweight champion of the world-Rocky Balboa. The only thing standing in his way is Apollo Creed. Now as far as this movie is concerned I will just say that--in spite of the three other films that preceded it-this picture manages to stand on its own. As a matter of fact, it probably has more action than the previous movies which certainly doesn't hurt it in any way. Unfortunately, what did hurt this movie, in my opinion, was the corny speech at the end which would be laughable if it wasn't meant to be taken so seriously. Be that as it may, the majority of the movie was decent enough and because of that I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",6,0,0,28 January 2016
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," The Exact Amount of Action, Suspense and Intrigue Necessary for a Movie of this Type
","Without a secretary for the Impossible Missions Force (IMF) the Operations Director named 'William Brandt' (Jeremy Renner) is unable to defend its continued existence by a Senate committee in the face of accusations by the Director of the C.I.A. 'Alan Hunley' (Alec Baldwin). As a result, 'Agent Ethan Hunt' (Tom Cruise) is declared a rogue operative and is forced to continue his investigation against a criminal organization known as the Syndicate all by himself. Unfortunately, when his investigation leads him to the exact location where the Chancellor of Austria is assassinated the orders from the C.I.A. now become focused on eliminating him--permanently. If that wasn't bad enough, his only lead is a former agent for MI6 named 'Ilsa Faust' (Rebecca Ferguson) whose allegiance is questionable at best and for the moment happens to be the only person he can trust. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that I thought this was an excellent spy film which contained the exact amount of action, suspense and intrigue necessary for a movie of this type. Likewise, I also enjoyed the performances of both Tom Cruise and Rebecca Ferguson who seemed to work real well together. Again, I thought that this was an excellent movie and I have rated it accordingly.",Null,1,2,23 February 2017
Jarhead," Somewhat Flawed
","This film has some excellent parts to it but at the same time it comes from a perspective that is somewhat flawed. I say this because the author, LCpl Anthony Swafford, was very immature and his resulting lack of discipline caused him to leave the Marine Corps with a disgruntled mentality. The book this movie is based on reflects that skewed outlook. Add to that the fact that there are always inevitable additions Hollywood inserts to make a film even more sensational (than the book itself) and one should be able to understand that everything is not necessarily as it seems. For example, there is one scenario where the marines are told to don their protective gear and play football in 112 degree heat. Well, since military training is supposed to be as realistic as possible I suppose this could happen-but only for a very short duration and certainly not at the pace depicted. Later on, when they are then told to drink out of their canteens (while their protective masks are still on) we find that some members have busted canteen tops or have been missing their drinking tubes for some time. And I doubt this very seriously. First of all, these marines were deployed to a combat area where the use of chemical or biological agents against them was considered very likely. That being the case, their gear would have been checked and inspected repeatedly and on a regular basis. Further, any defects would have been corrected almost immediately. After all, this was a front-line military unit and not a group of reservists put together at the last minute. Now, for some people this might seem to be a minor issue, but this is just one item (out of many) that gives the appearance that these marines were sent into a combat area for a lengthy time and then totally forgotten about. So, while this might have been the message the author was trying to convey, the fact is that it may have been more his perception than actual reality. And again, his perception was probably clouded by his attitude more than anything else. That said, this film essentially revolves around a very narrow (and possibly imagined) point-of-view. To be sure, our soldiers and marines had to endure a very long and trying stint in the desert. It was lonely and they felt anguish for their loved ones back home. To that end, this film does a very good job of capturing the monotony and sense of isolation. But the 'hurry up and wait' scenario is hardly a novel concept in this day and age any more than it has been with many armies for thousands of years. For example, siege warfare often lasted months upon end without the conveniences these marines had. Same thing with the Japanese soldiers on isolated island atolls during World War II. Not to mention the marine's Iraqi counterparts on the other side of the border who had to endure B-52 strikes with only their cardboard bunkers to protect them. Now, I don't say this to belittle the experiences our soldiers and marines had to endure, day in and day out, for over 6 months in such an arid and hostile environment. Again, it was a definite accomplishment and I think this movie does as much as any film can to capture that ordeal. But there were times when it seemed LCpl Swafford did more than his share of whining about his circumstances. Once again, it goes back to the source. Likewise, I thought there were some scenes which didn't need to be included and only served to make the Marine Corps look bad. That is not to say that the foul language wasn't unusual or that sex wasn't on the minds of these young marines. But was it really necessary to show them in such a crude fashion? Well, I suppose it might be if one had a negative attitude about what it means to be a marine. And again it all goes back to the author and possibly to those in Hollywood who have never served in the military. In short, this movie had some good points and it had some bad points. The depiction of the 'highway of death' and the oil fields burning were definite highlights. But the negativity and crudeness brought on by the recollections of someone who was clearly bitter about his experience seemed to distort reality and diminish the overall effect.",5,3,3,4 February 2013
Dunkirk," Escaping to Flee Another Day
","This film begins with a small British patrol being ambushed by the Germans in World War 2 with only one survivor by the name of 'Tommy' (Fionn Whitehead) able to escape. Fortunately, he manages to link up with the main British Expeditionary Force on the beach near Dunkirk, France. It's then that he realizes the predicament the army is in as they are trapped between the German army on one side and the English Channel on the other with very few ships to transport most of them. Not wanting to be killed or captured, he and another soldier named 'Gibson' (Aneurin Barnard ) spot a wounded comrade nearby and carry him on a stretcher to a nearby ship where they hope to secure transportation. Unfortunately, after depositing the wounded man they are ordered off the ship-which is then sunk by a German dive bomber. Later they board another British ship only to have it sunk by a German submarine. Meanwhile, three British Spitfires are busy trying to protect other ships from German airplanes while at the same time monitoring their fuel consumption which is rapidly being depleted. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film was nominated for several prestigious awards including an Academy Award for Best Motion Picture. Personally, I was less than impressed as the background noise (used to increase the tension) went on for much too long to the extent that it got quite annoying after awhile. Additionally, the constant switching from one scenario to another made the film seem rather disorganized as well. In short, although this movie has won a great deal of critical and popular acclaim, I was rather disappointed and have rated it accordingly. Below average.",3,1,1,12 March 2020
The Machinist," Dark and Disturbing
","'Trevor Reznik' (Christian Bale) is a man with a big problem in that he cannot sleep no matter how hard he tries. As a matter of fact, he hasn't actually slept in over a year and it is having an enormous impact on his mental and physical state as he has become extremely emaciated and his co-workers in the machine shop avoid him as much as possible due to the bad vibes they get whenever he's around. He does have two friends however. The first is a waitress at an airport restaurant by the name of 'Marie' (Aitana Sanchez-Gijon) who he converses with every night while dining on coffee and pie. The second is a prostitute named 'Stevie' (Jennifer Jason Leigh) who acknowledges that he is her favorite customer. But other than that he is totally alone. And then one day he meets a new co-worker by the name of 'Ivan' (John Sharian) who-for whatever reason-disturbs him like nobody else he has ever known and strange things happen whenever he's around. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a dark and dreary film which featured a number of surprising twists and turns as well as fine performances by the aforementioned Christian Bale, Jennifer Jason Leigh and John Sharian. On the minus side, I thought it lacked the necessary suspense which could have really enhanced this picture as a whole. Even so, this turned out to be an enjoyable film for the most part and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",6,0,1,9 April 2020
54," The Age of Disco
","'Shane O'Shea' (Ryan Phillippe) is a 19-year old man who lives in Jersey City and wants to experience the life of glamour on the other side of the Hudson River. So one night he goes to Manhattan and joins the huge crowd of people seeking entrance into the world-famous nightclub known as Studio 54. Although most are turned away, the club owner 'Steve Rubell' (Mike Myers) surprisingly allows Shane to come in and not long afterward hires him to be a busser. It's at this time that Shane meets 'Greg Randazzo' (Breckin Meyer) and his wife 'Anita' (Salma Hayek) who invite him to live with them for a while. He quickly accepts and before long gets caught up in the wild New York City nightlife which Studio 54 epitomized. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film served as an interesting snapshot of a time and place when disco ruled the airwaves. That said, while I enjoyed the trip down memory lane and thought that Mike Myers performed in an exceptional manner, I also thought that there wasn't sufficient character development in some places which subsequently caused the film to seem somewhat shallow and uneven at times. Be that as it may, I liked this movie for the most part and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",6,0,0,16 October 2018
The Fast and the Furious," Fast-Paced Action and Drama
","Set in Los Angeles, this movie focuses on a team of thieves who hijack trucks operating a high speeds from optimally powered race cars. The cargo is then taken and sold on the black market. Needless to say, the FBI and local authorities are anxious to capture and prosecute these criminals before the truckers take matters into their own hands. To help them on this case a young police officer by the name of 'Brian O'Conner' (Paul Walker) volunteers to go undercover and infiltrate the most high-profile illegal street racing team in the area which is led by a man named 'Dominic Toretto' (Vin Diesel) who also has a prison record for violence due to his explosive temper. However, in order to investigate this case Brian first has to get inside this close-knit team and that is more difficult than anybody realizes. Additionally, this particular team is but one of many and it might not be the one responsible. But one thing is sure-action needs to be taken soon before violence erupts on the highways. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film has enough fast-paced action and drama to satisfy most fans of the genre. No doubt about it. On a more critical note though, I thought that some of the characters-most notably 'Letty' (Michelle Rodriguez), 'Vince' (Matt Schulze) and 'Hector' (Noel Gugliemi)--were much too pretentious and almost to the point of being downright annoying. Likewise, some of the previously mentioned action scenes were more than a little unrealistic as well. But that's Hollywood for you. In any case, from what I understand this film has turned into a profitable enterprise for Universal Pictures and since nothing succeeds like success has bred numerous sequels in its wake. That said, despite the flaws just mentioned I enjoyed this movie and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",6,0,1,2 January 2017
The Exorcist," The Scariest Movie I Have Ever Seen
","This movie begins in Northern Iraq with an elderly priest named 'Father Merrin' (Max von Sydow) finding a mysterious object while on an archaeological expedition. It then shifts to Georgetown in the District of Columbia where a young girl named 'Regan' (Linda Blair) begins to act in a highly unusual manner which eventually leads her mother 'Chris MacNeil' (Ellen Burstyn) to call a priest named 'Father Damien Karras' (Jason Miller) to help figure out what is going on. As it so happens, Father Karras also specializes in psychiatry but what he discovers when he visits Regan horrifies him to his very soul. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this is without a doubt the scariest horror film I have ever seen. Although it starts off rather slow it still has small pieces of suspense that manages to maintain the film until the real terror kicks in--and it kicks in hard! That said, for those who enjoy a good horror film and have never seen this movie, I strongly recommend it because it is truly excellent. Just make sure you have a good priest or therapist you can call afterwards.",9,0,0,21 March 2017
Goon," A Potential Blockbuster Almost Ruined by Unnecessary Vulgarity
","Although he may not be the smartest person in the world, 'Doug Glatt' (Seann William Scott) is a really nice guy with an incredible skill-he knows how to beat up people. And because of that he earns his living as a bouncer at a nightclub while the rest of his family looks down upon him. Then one day at a hockey game everything changes for him when one of the players decides to go into the stands to beat up his best friend 'Pat' (Jay Baruchel). After easily beating the hockey player to a pulp Doug soon lands a job as a top-notch goon for the Halifax Highlanders with a mission to protect the best player on the team by the name of 'Xavier LaFlamme' (Marc-André Grondin). Unfortunately, as Doug becomes more popular the spoiled LaFlamme becomes more jealous and insecure. To make matters even worse, the most dominant goon in hockey named 'Ross Rhea' (Liev Schreiber) is soon to return from a 20-game suspension and has no interest in sharing his hard-earned reputation with any player from another team. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this movie had the potential of being a true blockbuster but it suffered from one serious flaw in that it had way too much vulgarity throughout the course of the film-and much of it was totally unnecessary. Of course, if this film was intended only for immature audiences then I could possibly understand some of the crass and sophomoric language. But it loses much of its appeal to viewers who are looking for something a bit more wholesome. Again, this film had some real potential. Unfortunately, the director (Michael Dowse) chose to take the low road and for that reason I have rated it a little lower as a result.",6,1,1,22 May 2017
Captain America: Civil War," Battle of the Avengers
","Although the Avengers have managed to thwart several attempts by criminal organizations to wreak havoc upon the world, a newer problem has emerged which concerns the incredible damage done in those areas where the battles have occurred. So in order to address this issue the United Nations comes up with a plan to place the Avengers under the strict control of a special multinational panel. Unfortunately, this idea doesn't please all of the Avengers and as a result half of them decide to follow 'Captain America' (Chris Evans) and leave the group while those that remain agree with 'Iron Man' (Robert Downey Jr.) to accept U.N. authority over them. Unfortunately, things become much more intense when Captain America and his allies do battle with a criminal mastermind and thereby not only break the U.N. mandate but also force the remaining Avengers to attempt to apprehend them so that they can be tried and punished for their actions. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film definitely had its share of action from start-to-finish with a multitude of superheroes sharing the big screen. To that effect, while I liked the addition of 'Spider-Man' (Tom Holland) and 'Ant-Man' (Paul Rudd) I must admit that the abundance of characters became a bit too much at times. Having said that, however, I still enjoyed this picture for the most part and I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",7,0,1,7 September 2018
Hardball," Has Elements of Comedy, Drama and Romance
","'Conor O'Neill' (Keanu Reeves) is a gambling addict who is suddenly finding himself in real financial trouble. It gets so bad that he is forced to go to a friend who works in the Chicago stock exchange and begs for $1200 in order to pay off some people it's best not to mess with. Quite unexpectedly, his friend makes him an unusual offer in which he will pay $500 a week if Conor agrees to help him coach a minor league team of black kids living in the projects. It's then that his friend decides to skip out and essentially leaves him all by himself. Although he is promised his money he realizes that in order to field a team he needs two more kids and they are being held back by a mean teacher at the school who refuses to let them play. Now rather than reveal any more of this movie I will just say that it attempted to combine several different cinematic elements into a fairly cohesive plot and succeeded to a certain extent. For example, it had elements of comedy, drama and romance but none of them seemed to overwhelm the other—at least for the most part. It also starred Diane Lane (as 'Elisabeth Wilkes') who is always a welcome addition to any film. On the flip side, however, there were a couple of occasions when the acting just wasn't sufficient for the situation at hand which made the movie seem a bit uneven. Even so, I enjoyed the movie and as a result I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",6,1,1,26 September 2015
Resident Evil," Very Exciting
","The Umbrella Corporation is a multi-conglomerate which operates a secret underground laboratory beneath a metropolitan area called Raccoon City. Inside the lab, scientists were illegally producing a virus which reanimates dead human beings. Realizing that the T-virus was worth a great sum of money on the black market, a thief steals the virus. However, just before attempting to escape the facility with the virus and the antidote, he deliberately contaminates the lab. Unfortunately, he doesn't quite make it out before being knocked out by nerve gas. A crack team of commandos then enter the facility and capture three people: 'Alice' (Milla Jovovich), 'Matt Addison' (Eric Mabius) and 'Spence Parks' (James Purefoy). Everyone else has been supposedly killed by the computer defense system known as 'the Red Queen'. Racing against time, the commandos enter the facility known as 'the hive' to disable the Red Queen and find out what has happened. Anyway, rather than divulge anything that might spoil the movie for those who haven't seen it, I will stop right here. However, I would like to say that while the overall acting isn't that great, Milla Jovovich, and to a lesser extent Michelle Rodriguez (as the commando named 'Rain Ocampo'), give awesome performances. Additionally, the action is fast-paced and the music complements it very well. All in all, I found this movie to be very exciting and it should appeal to those who like an action-packed thriller of this sort.",7,1,2,8 November 2012
The Dirty Dozen," An All-Star Cast
","Lee Marvin stars as 'Major Reisman' who has displeased his superiors so much that he is put in charge of a secret mission to parachute behind enemy lines to kill German officers vacationing at a château in France. If that wasn't bad enough, all of his soldiers are hardened criminals of the worst sort who are coerced by the chance that they may be given a parole. Now as implausible as this movie really is I must admit that it offers plenty of entertainment value due in large part to an all-star cast which includes Charles Bronson (as 'Joseph Wladislaw'), Clint Walker ('Samson Posey'), Jim Brown ('Robert Jefferson'), Donald Sutherland ('Vernon Pinkley'), Ernest Borgnine ('General Worden'), George Kennedy ('Major Max Armbruster') along with the aforementioned Lee Marvin. Yet with all of these mentioned I thought Telly Savalas deserved special recognition for his performance as the psychotic pervert 'Archer Maggott' which really stood out. In any case, this was a big movie back in the 60's and those who might be interested in this type of film should definitely check it out. I rate it as definitely above average.",8,0,3,17 May 2015
District 9," A Bit Disappointing
","An alien mother ship hovers over Johannesburg, South Africa, for several months without any contact being established. Finally, humans manage to get inside and discover almost 2 million sick and malnourished 'prawn-like' aliens. They are resettled on the outskirts of the city and soon their compound begins to resemble a slum. Eventually, the decision is made to relocate them further away and an armed group is sent in to evict them. Trouble immediately follows. So much for the basic plot. That said, at first I wasn't really sure what to think about this film. It has some parts which are extremely slow and some of the action was almost equally boring. The special effects were very good. Some of the best I have seen in awhile. However, apart from the acting of the lead character, 'Wikus Van De Merwe' (Sharlto Copley) the overall acting was pretty much non-existent and quite honestly failed to impress me. Even so, from what I understand it was nominated for 4 Academy Awards and won the Saturn Award for 'Best International Film'. It has also made over $115 million. So apparently there are a lot of people who liked this movie. And while I didn't necessarily dislike it, I just couldn't bring myself to get that enthused with it. No doubt many will disagree with me and that's fine. Be that as it may, this is one of those films that audiences who love CGI and action will probably really enjoy as it has both in spades. So if that's the case then I would strongly recommend this movie. But for those who like science fiction with a more 'human element' then it's possible that they may find it to be a bit disappointing.",4,1,3,10 November 2012
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Enjoyable Enough for the Time Spent
","At a small inn in the town of Bree which borders the Shire, the dwarf known as 'Thorin Oakenshield' (Richard Armitage) meets the wizard named 'Gandalf' (Ian McKellen). While there Gandalf proposes to help Thorin obtain the 'Arkenstone' which is the symbol of dwarf leadership and just happens to be in the possession of the dragon known as Smaug in his mountain lair where the dwarfs used to live. Obviously, since they cannot expect to simply kill Smaug and forcibly take the Arkenstone, Gandalf suggests that they send a burglar to steal it from him. This is where the Hobbit named 'Bilbo Baggins' (Martin Freeman) comes in. Now rather than reveal any more of this film and risk spoiling it for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this movie was a bit more watchable than the previous film 'The Hobbit-An Unexpected Journey' due in large part to better CGI and action sequences. I especially liked the scenes involving the she-elf, 'Tauriel' (Evangline Lilly) as she brought some feminine beauty to an otherwise male dominated cast. In any case, like its predecessor this particular movie adds elements to the story which the book did not contain so Tolkien purists might be a bit chagrined. However, like I mentioned in my review of 'The Hobbit-An Unexpected Journey', this film was based on a relatively small book compared to the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy and filler material had to be added if they were going to make 3 movies out of it-hence the number of action scenes and additional elements. Be that as it may this movie was enjoyable enough for the time spent and I rate it as slightly above average.",6,0,1,31 December 2014
Remember the Titans," Entertaining to a Certain Degree but Historically Inaccurate
","Set during the turbulent years of the civil rights era, this film centers around a new black football coach by the name of 'Herman Boone' (Denzel Washington) being hired to take over a high school team that was predominantly white until a court order implemented the merger with a nearby black high school. This hiring, coupled with the fact that their existing white coach named 'Bill Yoast' (Will Patton) was highly regarded, fueled racial fears unparalleled in that particular area of Virginia which not even a winning record could totally alleviate. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that, although this film was entertaining to a certain degree, there were susbstantial historical inaccuracies which were rather difficult to ignore. For starters, Coach Herman Boone didn't take a team that was in extreme disarray and build it into a powerhouse by his sheer ingenuity or charisma. Far from it, as many of his own players and staff were highly critical of his coaching style which they believed was unnecessarily cruel and abusive. Likewise, there are several other blatant distortions which can easily be ascertained if the viewer chooses to do so. But all of that aside, the fact remains that Herman Boone was a very successful coach and his overall record proves that point. Additionally, most of us will never know the pressure he had to go through-especially during this particular time in history. I just wish Hollywood hadn't taken so many liberties with the truth. That being said, while it may not justify the 'based on a true story' advertisement, it was still an enjoyable film for the most part and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",6,0,1,20 March 2019
Batman Begins," A Necessary Reboot
","In search of a meaningful way to combat injustice and strike fear into the hearts of evil men, 'Bruce Wayne' (Christian Bale) makes his way to a special temple high on a in Bhutan. While there he learns special skills and techniques but most importantly he learns how to isolate and combat his own fears as well. After a major disagreement with the leadership of the temple Bruce Wayne returns to Gotham City and it's then that he adopts the symbol of his greatest fear and becomes the caped crime-fighter known as Batman. But even though he has success against evil what he doesn't know is that a plan has already been put in place to destroy the entire city and he has little time and few allies to help him. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this particular movie was a necessary reboot after the last film ('Batman & Robin') and as such deserves a certain amount of credit. That said, however, I also happen to think that-like some of its predecessors-there were too many characters and subplots thrown in which in this instance caused the film to have a longer running time that necessary. Even so, it was a decent movie by and large and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",6,0,0,4 March 2017
Liar Liar," A Dishonest Lawyer Grappling with the Truth
","'Fletcher Reede' (Jim Carrey) is an extremely good defense attorney due in large part to a conscious decision on his part to say anything to get his client off the hook. Unfortunately, this lack of honesty on his part has bled over into his family life with the result that his wife 'Audrey Reede' (Maura Tierney) not only doesn't trust him but has divorced him as well. He does, however, have some visitation rights to see his son 'Max Reede' (Justin Cooper) but being the self-absorbed person that he is often wastes these opportunities due to work commitments. Naturally, to absolve himself he then lies to his wife and son rather than telling them the truth. However, that all comes to a screeching halt when his young son blows out the candles on his birthday cake and wishes that for just 24 hours his father has to tell the truth. And having built his entire career on lying that becomes a nightmare for him. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an extremely uneven comedy which had some really funny scenes but also featured some serious over-acting on the part of Jim Carrey. Still, the good points managed to outweigh the bad and for that reason I have rated this film accordingly. Slightly above average.",6,1,2,24 April 2020
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Filler Material
","As anybody who has read the book knows 'the Hobbit' was intended to be pure 'fantasy' with a little 'adventure' thrown in for good measure. And when compared with the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy it was the shortest book of them all. So it came as a big surprise to me when I learned that 'the Hobbit' was being made into 3 separate movies. Begging the question: Was this being done to capture the essence of the book or was this simply a scheme to make more money? Well, having just watched this movie I can honestly say that this isn't about capturing art for art's sake-it's about making money. So much so that the producer took a portion of the'fantasy and adventure' from the book and basically used 'CGI and action' as filler material. After all, he's got two more movies to make. Now, to be fair the other 'Lord of the Rings' films had more than their fair share of CGI and action too. But they managed to incorporate the splendor of the fantasy to a certain degree. This movie has CGI and action. And I have no doubt the next two films will have more of the same. But it should have been much better. As such I rate this movie as only average.",5,4,7,29 December 2013
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," An Exciting Movie with Plenty of Action and Suspense
","This movie begins in Budapest with an IMF agent being killed and a folder containing Russian nuclear codes subsequently taken from him. The scene then shifts to a Russian prison where 'Agent Ethan Hunt' (Tom Cruise) is being incarcerated and a new mission to free him is underway. Once this is accomplished he is given a new team with a mission to infiltrate the Kremlin and obtain files related to the person code-named 'Cobalt' who they believe stole the nuclear codes. Unfortunately, this mission is seriously compromised and results in a horrific explosion which attracts world attention. Not only that, but Ethan is once again captured by the Russians. However, being extremely skillful in escape and evasion he manages to get away and rejoins his team-only this time they are isolated and disavowed due to the aftermath of the disastrous Kremlin break-in. This leaves Ethan's team with few options other than to try to thwart 'Cobalt' from starting a nuclear war between the United States and Russia-with everybody out to get them. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an exciting movie with plenty of action and suspense all the way through. Admittedly, some of the scenes were a bit over-the-top but I suppose that's to be expected from Hollywood in this day and age. Be that as it may, I enjoyed this film and I have rated it accordingly.

28 Days Later...," A First Rate Zombie Film
","'Jim' (Cillian Murphy) wakes up in a hospital room and finds everyone gone. So he ventures into the street and finds the entire city of London deserted. Or so he thinks. When he walks into a church he is attacked by a zombie-like person from which he barely manages to escape. Suddenly, even more begin to attack him and he is rescued in the nick of time by 'Mark' (Noah Huntley) and 'Selena' (Naomi Harris). Taking him to a safe haven they explain the viral epidemic which has taken over Great Britain and left the three of them terribly out-numbered. At any rate, rather than giving all of the details to this movie, I will just say that this is a first rate zombie film. Both Noah Huntley and Naomi Harris do an outstanding job as does the director, Danny Boyle. Now, I fully understand that there are a couple of differences with these zombies which contrast with the more traditional view. For starters, these zombies don't stumble along like 'normal' zombies. They run. Very fast. They also don't seem to need the mandatory 'headshot' that 'normal' zombies require. Claymore mines and machine guns seem to do the trick quite nicely. Likewise, while they attack humans, I didn't see them feasting on human flesh so much. But that may have been understood and therefore considered unnecessary to show. Additionally, their ability to infect humans is much faster than usual. Sometimes as quickly as 10 seconds. So in that respect there isn't much response time or waiting around. Still, all things considered I really liked this movie and I think most zombie fans will too.",7,0,1,14 December 2012
Peaceful Warrior," A Heavy Dose of Zen Philosophy
","Dan Millman (Scott Mechlowicz) is a college gymnast who has a vivid nightmare about shattering his leg upon dismounting from the rings. And while he is lying on the ground in pain he notices a man who is wearing two different colored shoes picking up the pieces of his leg. He then immediately awakens and in an attempt to forget about it decides to go to a nearby gas station for a snack-and it's then that he meets a man wearing two different colored shoes. To make matters even more surreal, when he leaves he sees the attendant sitting down but when he turns back around he notices that the man is now standing on top of the roof of the gas station. As one might expect this puzzles him quite a bit, but even more than that, as he returns to the service station the next day to try to solve this puzzle the man he now calls 'Socrates' (Nick Nolte) is so astute that it causes him to reanalyze his entire belief system in the process as well. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an entertaining film which incorporates a heavy dose of Zen philosophy throughout. Be that as it may, while I haven't read the book from which it was based, I must admit that I found a couple of the scenes a bit over-the-top and totally unnecessary to the overall story. Having said that, however, I still enjoyed it for the most part and have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",6,0,1,4 October 2018
Good Will Hunting," An Emotionally Disturbed Mathmatical Genius from South Boston
","This movie begins with an incredibly gifted young man named 'Will Hunting' (Matt Damon) working as a janitor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The problem with him is that he is extremely anti-social and is constantly getting into trouble with the law. Then one day he sees an incredibly difficult mathematical formula posted on a bulletin board there at the university and he writes the solution on it without any difficulty. Needless to say, the professor who put the problem on the bulletin board named 'Gerald Lambeau' (Stellan Skarsgård) is totally amazed and immediately sets out to find the person responsible. However, when he finds Will he is totally unprepared for the emotional wreck in front of him. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that I really enjoyed the performance of Matt Damon, Robin Williams (as the psychologist 'Dr. Sean Maguire') and to a lesser extent that of Ben Affleck (as Will's loyal friend 'Chuckie'). On that note, I should probably mention that Matt Damon won an Oscar for 'Best Actor in a Leading Role' while both Robin Williams and Minnie Driver (as Will's girlfriend 'Skylar') were each nominated for an Oscar as well. Be that as it may, although the film has some slow scenes here and there it has a quality soundtrack and enough good drama and comedy to entertain nicely enough and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",6,1,1,21 August 2017
I Am Legend," A Superior Remake of 'The Last Man on Earth' and 'The Omega Man'
","This movie begins with a scientist announcing a cure for cancer on television for all the world to see. Unfortunately, three years later the cure mutates into a deadly plague and kills almost everyone left on earth. And those who aren't killed are turned into creatures similar to zombies-only very fast and agile. However, as luck would have it, an Army doctor named 'Robert Neville' (Will Smith) finds that he is one of the few people who is immune and as a result drives through the desolated city of New York with a dog named 'Sam' as his only companion. Naturally, being a doctor he keeps himself busy trying to find a cure for those who have become infected while at the same time looking for others who might have escaped the plague all together. Then one day events soon begin to overtake him. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film is the second remake of 'The Last Man on Earth' which was filmed in 1964 and remade as 'The Omega Man' in 1971. Although these two films were pretty good in their own right, I have to say that this particular movie was definitely the best of them all. For starters, as might be expected for a motion picture in this day and age, the CGI was clearly far superior. More importantly however was the acting of Will Smith which carried the day and subsequently resulted in his winning a Saturn Award for 'Best Actor'. Likewise, the movie itself was nominated by that same awards committee for 'Best Science Fiction Film' as well. In short, this was an extremely good movie and I have rated it accordingly.",8,0,1,13 June 2017
The Bourne Legacy," Operation Outlook
","Although the character of 'Jason Bourne' (played by Matt Damon) doesn't appear in this film, the movie basically begins where 'The Bourne Supremacy' left off with him having escaped from Moscow and subsequently providing top-secret information pertaining to 'Operation Treadstone' to key officials. It's at this point that a new character by the name of 'Aaron Cross' (Jeremy Renner) is introduced who is part of a similar (and equally sinister) CIA program called 'Operation Outcome'. As it so happens, Aaron is being punished for going off the grid for a few days by having to train in extreme winter conditions somewhere in a remote part of Alaska. What he doesn't know is that Operation Outcome has been compromised and in order to cover everything up the primary executive in charge named 'Eric Boyer' (Edward Norton) has ordered the execution of everything and everyone involved. This results in the liquidation of several agents with Aaron and a female scientist named 'Dr. Marta Shearing' (Rachel Weisz) being the only ones managing to elude their assassins. Unfortunately, Eric has other methods and resources at his disposal and he remains very intent on completing the task at hand. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that, despite shifting the focus away from Jason Bourne, this film still managed to make room for another sequel--with either Matt Damon or Jeremy Renner as the primary character-by cleverly side-stepping any major impediments to the overall course of events. On the flip side, I must admit that the chase scene at the end was much too long and improbable to be taken seriously and actually detracted from the movie as a whole. In any case, it was a decent addition to the Bourne Series and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",6,1,3,13 October 2016
Coyote Ugly," Coyote Average
","This movie begins with a young woman named 'Violet Sanford' (Piper Perado) having made the decision to quit her job at a local pizzeria and leave her home in New Jersey to try her luck being a songwriter in New York City. Yet even though she has thought about this move for years things don't go nearly as well as she had planned-and then things get much worse. It's at this point that she meets a grill cook by the name of 'Kevin O'Donnell' (Adam Garcia) who does his best to help her out even though he has few connections in the music industry. Unfortunately, that being the case, she gets tentatively accepted for a job dancing and bartending at a raucous bar known as Coyote Ugly which causes her life to change drastically from then. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an uneven comedy-drama which had both good points and rather weak ones as well. To that extent, both the acting and the comedy were mediocre but the plot was interesting and it kept my attention for the most part so I suppose I shouldn't be too critical about it overall. That being the case, I have rated it accordingly. Average.",5,0,1,12 September 2019
Gran Torino," Clint Eastwood at His Best
","Having recently lost his wife a retired automaker and Korean War veteran named 'Walt Kowalski' (Clint Eastwood) is angry at the way the world around him has changed. For starters, the economic situation in his hometown of Detroit has not only devasted the livelihoods of everyone around him but a massive influx of Khmer refugees into his neighborhood has also changed things as well. To that extent, he simply wants to be left alone. Unfortunately, when he catches his young next-door neighbor 'Thao' (Bee Vang) attempting to steal his pristine 1972 Gran Torino, he suddenly becomes more involved in the neighborhood than he could have ever imagined. Now rather than reveal any more I will freely admit that Clint Eastwood has starred in a couple of rather weak films from time to time. Fortunately, this is not the case here as he delivers an excellent performance in this particular film. Admittedly, I didn't care for some of the language and would have liked a slightly different ending, but all things considered I consider this to be one of the better movies for that year and I have rated it accordingly.",8,0,0,16 August 2019
Hero," An Action Film with Several Twists and Turns
","This picture begins in ancient China during the 'Warring States Period' which features seven rival kingdoms all competing against one another with the Zhou and Qin kingdoms featured most prominently in this film. As the story unfolds, a warrior known simply as 'Nameless' (Jet Li) comes to the 'King of the Qin' (played by Daoming Chin) to report that he has killed the three greatest assassins who threaten the King's life. The warrior then goes on to recount the story during which the King grants certain favors to him as a symble of gratitude with the main concession being to allow Nameless to advance to within 10 paces of him. It's at this time that the King begins to observe some flaws in the story which puts a new perspective on everything. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that viewers of action films will probably enjoy this movie quite a bit as it has that one ingredient in spades. It also has several twists and turns which are certainly interesting in their own right. Unfortunately, as far as the action scenes are concerned, there were a number of preposterous stunts which I thought actually lessened the film's overall entertainment value. Likewise, the manner in which the story kept being recounted-with certain key changes in the process-didn't help that much either. In short, although this film was well received by most viewers, I didn't find it all that entertaining and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Slightly below average.",4,2,4,24 January 2019
The Hurt Locker," Exciting
","After their leader is killed by a bomb blast, two members of an Explosive Ordinance (EOD) team get a new soldier by the name of 'SFC William James' (Jeremy Renner) to take his place. Unfortunately, unlike their previous team leader their new Non-Commissioned Officer-in-Charge (NCOIC) is much more reckless and as a result has a tendency to expose them to much more risk. Even so, he is very good at what he does and the other two soldiers, 'SGT J.T. Sanborn' (Anthony Mackie) and 'SPC Owen Eldridge' (Brian Geraghty) continue to follow his orders even though they have severe misgivings. Now as far as this movie is concerned I will just note that it won 6 Academy Awards along with a host of other numerous accolades as well. It is exciting and thoroughly entertaining. Having said that, I must admit that there were some scenes which were clearly exaggerated a bit which affected the film's overall credibility somewhat. But again, I still found it to be highly entertaining and I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",7,0,1,17 October 2015
Pawn Sacrifice," Historically Flawed
","This film takes place during the Cold War with a young American by the name of 'Bobby Fischer' (played by Tobey Maguire) setting out to become the World Chess Champion which had been under exclusive domination of the Soviet Union for almost 40 years. Yet, even though he was a most formidable challenger there were several obstacles he had to overcome, which not only included an incredible number of skilled Soviet grandmasters, but his own character flaws as well. To that end, this film provides an interesting--albeit somewhat flawed-glimpse into this person's unique quest. Now, having said that, let me first state that I thought both Tobey Maguire, and Liv Schreiber (as 'Boris Spassky') performed in an excellent manner. However, to be fair there were certain aspects which lacked historical accuracy and should probably be mentioned as well. First, I don't believe this film gives an accurate or honest portrayal of Bobby Fischer. Yes, he would often become quite agitated when distracted by noise. But let's be honest, he wasn't the only chess player to voice his displeasure in that regard. Likewise, there were a couple of times he walked out during certain chess competitions. However, it should be noted that Bobby had religious restrictions which forbade him from playing on the Sabbath. So when his legitimate objections were ignored he did what he felt was necessary. Yet rather than giving him credit for putting his religious beliefs ahead of everything else this film uses this fact against him. Also worth mentioning is the fact that Bobby was very shy and socially awkward. Unfortunately, rather than taking this into account this film makes him look like a raving lunatic instead. Now, that is not to say that Bobby didn't eventually go completely insane. But this was a gradual process which accelerated after he won the World Championship due in part to his feelings of betrayal by the same religious institution he had put so much faith-and money--into. Additionally, as mentioned earlier, Bobby was quite shy and as a result he preferred to do things on his own and was very much a loner. That said, this movie greatly exaggerates the influence 'Father Bill Lombardy' (Peter Sarsgaard) and 'Paul Marshall' (Michael Stuhlbarg) had upon him. Further, it should also be mentioned that Boris Spassky was not the World Champion when he and Bobby sat down at the board during the Piatigorsky Cup in 1966-that honor belonged at the time to Tigran Petrosian and it would be another 3 years before Boris could claim that title. To that extent, these are just a few of the inaccuracies detailed in this film--with several other flaws out there that I haven't mentioned. That being said, those who have followed Bobby Fisher's career will probably be less than impressed with the manner in which he has been portrayed. Ironically, in spite of these criticisms, I still found this film to still be entertaining to a certain degree and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",6,0,1,8 April 2017
Kelly's Heroes," In Search of Gold Behind Enemy Lines
","While on a routine reconnaissance mission an American soldier by the name of 'Kelly' (Clint Eastwood) captures a German colonel and discovers a bar of gold inside the briefcase he is carrying. After further interrogation Kelly learns that there are a lot more of them in a bank not too far from where his platoon is currently located. Needless to say, this interests him greatly but the problem for him is that this bank is located behind enemy lines. So to meet this difficult challenge he gathers a motley bunch of soldiers within his platoon to secretly liberate the gold from the Germans without the knowledge of his American superiors. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film had a number of talented actors which included not only Clint Eastwood but also Telly Savalas (as 'Big Joe'), Don Rickles ('Crapgame'), Donald Sutherland ('Oddball') and Carroll O'Connor ('General Colt'). Yet despite the decent cast and interesting plot, I didn't think the film itself was nearly as good as it could have been in large part due to the performance of Donald Sutherland's character who was clearly mismatched for the time period in question. That being said, while I have little doubt that the nonchalant attitude displayed would have been better understood and appreciated during the Vietnam Conflict-or possibly even the Korean War-it seemed rather weird here. But perhaps that's just me. In any case, while this film wasn't too bad I also think it was clearly overrated and for that reason I have given it a value more clearly in line with my views. Average.",5,1,5,30 May 2019
Donnie Brasco," A Passable Movie
","With a cast that included Al Pacino, Johnny Depp, Michael Madsen and Anne Heche I honestly expected something slightly better than this. Make no mistake, it isn't a bad picture by any means. But in some places it seemed rather dark and slow-moving. Even so, Al Pacino was excellent as the hit man (Lefty Ruggiero). Johnny Depp (as the undercover FBI agent 'Donnie Brasco/Joe Pistone') and Michael Madsen ('Sonny Black') also turned in fine performances as well. And while Anne Heche ('Maggie Pistone') was definitely cute, I thought the movie could have used a bit more fine-tuning in the relationship between her and Johnny Depp. Perhaps if they had shown some happier moments between the two prior to him taking the undercover assignment it would have added some depth to her character. As it was, all we get to see is a strained relationship from the very start. Likewise, it seems the film ends a little too soon and it could have been drawn out a bit more. All things considered, this was a passable movie and fans of Al Pacino or Johnny Depp probably won't be too disappointed.",5,6,11,29 September 2012
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Almost As Good As the Original
","This sequel to 'Resident Evil' begins where the first movie left off. 'Alice' (Milla Jovovich) has been captured by the Umbrella Corporation and is having experiments done to her while she is mostly unconscious. During this time the Umbrella Corporation sends security personnel back into 'the Hive' to try to figure out what happened. Upon entering, the security personnel are quickly overwhelmed by the zombies who rapidly enter into the general population of 'Raccoon City'. This causes mass panic as the infection spreads out-of-control. When Alice awakens she finds herself alone in the laboratory and upon exiting it sees the devastation brought upon Raccoon City. At any rate, rather than giving away any surprises I will just say that this film is almost as good as the original. Not only does Milla Jovovich give an awesome performance but so does Sienna Guillory ('Jill Valentine') and Oded Fehr ('Carolos Olivera'). As a matter of fact, Sienna Guillory could have probably starred in her own right had Milla Jovovich not been available. Likewise, Sandrine Holt (as the television newscaster, 'Terri Morales') and Mike Epps ('L.J.') did very well in a supporting role. I also liked the performance of Thomas Kretschmann as the bad guy, 'Major Tom Cain'. In short, there is a lot to like about this film. It has good acting, plentiful action and excellent special effects. As such, if a person liked the original then they will probably enjoy this one as well.",6,1,1,20 November 2012
Guardians of the Galaxy," Lots of CGI and Action
","On the same night his mother dies a young boy named 'Peter Quill' (Chris Pratt) is abducted by an alien UFO. Several years later he becomes a thief working for an alien by the name of 'Yondu Udonta' (Michael Rooker). However, when he steals a valuable piece of merchandise known as an 'infinity stone' that Yondu had his sights set on he soon finds that he has a price put on his head. But bounty hunters aren't the only ones looking for him as a savage warlord also wants the infinity stone and sends a beautiful assassin named 'Gamora' (Zoe Saldana) to bring it to him. Anyway, rather than reveal any more of the movie and risk spoiling it for those who haven't seen it, I will just say that fans of CGI and action will probably love this particular picture as it has lots of both. Unfortunately, other than perhaps the presence of the aforementioned Michael Rooker and Zoe Saldana, I honestly didn't consider this movie to be as good as the marketing and hype surrounding it. The humor wasn't that sharp, the overall plot was rather predictable and neither the CGI nor the action managed to maintain my interest that much. Accordingly, I rate it as slightly below average.",4,5,12,26 December 2014
The Evil Dead," A Splatter Film
","I bought this movie recently under the mistaken assumption that it was a zombie film. At least that's what a zombie site on the internet said. Needless to say, this is NOT a film about zombies. At least it's not about zombies in the traditional sense. It's more about demonic possession. Regardless, this is a great low-budget film for those who enjoy the splatter film genre. Gore hounds will simply love it. Horror fans might like it too depending on which style of horror they prefer. But this isn't Hitchcock or even Stephen King for that matter. Like I said, it's a splatter film and because of that it revels in graphic special effects and violence. Now, some of the special effects are very good. Unfortunately, some of them are downright silly and (in my opinion) lowers the film's value. Likewise, the acting is essentially non-existent. But that's not through any fault of the actors necessarily. The fact is that there simply wasn't any room for acting or much dialogue due to the huge amount of brutal action and special effects. And while I recognized Bruce Campbell, the rest of the actors were completely unknown to me. Not that it really mattered of course as nobody was going to win an Academy Award for their roles in this movie anyway. It did however manage to win a Saturn Award for 'Best Low-Budget Film' and that is certainly quite an achievement. Even so, the fact that it is a low-budget film doesn't necessarily mean that everybody should overlook the obvious faults and pretend they don't exist. Things like dialogue, plot and character development are important and shouldn't be dismissed because the special effects are so plentiful or gory. After all, it doesn't cost much money to write a script. It also doesn't require much imagination to improve on a plot that consists simply of 5 young adults going to a cabin and (all but one) getting chopped up in graphic detail. For that reason, I thought this movie could have been better. But that is just my opinion. One thing I do know though is that this movie isn't for the squeamish or the faint-of-heart. But it is sure to satisfy a certain niche who loves this type of film. And that's perfectly fine.",4,3,7,25 October 2012
Mission: Impossible II," A Mission to Acquire a Deadly Super-Virus and It's Antidote
","When a suspected super-virus called 'Chimera' and its antidote 'Bellerophon' is stolen by a ruthless former IMF agent by the name of 'Sean Ambrose' (Dougray Scott), 'Ethan Hunt' (Tom Cruise) is called upon to acquire both of these products and bring them back to his supervisor 'Commander Swanbeck' (Anthony Hopkins). To do that he is tasked with recruiting a former girlfriend of Sean's by the name of 'Nyah Nordoff-Hall' (Thandie Newton) who is also an international thief. What they don't realize is that Sean doesn't actually have the virus and plans to manipulate the IMF to accomplish the task for him and considers everyone involved to be completely expendable. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film had a complicated plot which was convoluted by numerous action scenes thrown in for good measure. As a result the overall film suffered accordingly. That being said, while the movie was still entertaining to a degree, it could have been better and for that reason I have rated it as just slightly above average.",6,1,1,2 February 2017
The Adjustment Bureau," An Interesting Romantic Science-Fiction
","This movie turned out to be an interesting romantic science-fiction which concerns a politician by the name of 'David Norris' (Matt Damon) who accidentally encounters divine beings responsible for determining his fate. By complete accident, he meets and falls in love with a woman named, 'Elise Sellas' (Emily Blunt) who he is not supposed to become romantically involved with as it will alter the future course of events. Because of this he is then given a choice to either fulfill his destiny--and let Elise fulfill her destiny as well--or attempt to stay together and let the chips fall where they may. Now, rather than saying too much and possibly spoiling the film for those who haven't seen it I won't say what happens next. I will say, however, that this is a cute and imaginative movie which viewers might find enjoyable if they like films of this nature. That said, I rate this movie as slightly above average.",6,1,1,19 February 2013
Avengers: Age of Ultron," An Okay Sequel Containing Lots of Action and CGI
","This movie essentially begins with the Avengers raiding a Hydra stronghold in Eastern Europe and in the process seizing a staff previously belonging to Thor's brother Loki. Naturally, 'Thor' (Chris Hemsworth) wants to take the scepter back to Asgard but he acquiesces for a few days to allow his Avenger teammate 'Tony Stark/Iron Man' (Robert Downey Jr.) a couple of days to examine it a little further. Unfortunately, Tony Stark has no idea of what he has stumbled upon and accidentally unleashes a computerized being named 'Ultron' (James Spader) who decides to help humanity evolve--by destroying it completely. To gain time and keep the Avengers occupied he creates an army of robots all controlled by his computer intelligence. Meanwhile, he subsequently acquires the metal used to make the shield for 'Captain America' (Chris Evans) and forces a scientist named 'Dr. Helen Cho' (Claudia Kim) to use her knowledge in synthetic tissue to create a new body for himself. Throw in the addition of several other superheroes and villains and the result is complete mayhem on earth. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that, from what I understand, this film made over $1.4 billion and ranks as one of the highest grossing films ever made. And with a profit margin like that additional sequels are already in the making. Be that as it may, however, I was not overly-impressed with this movie by any means. Although the CGI was top-notch I thought there were too many characters involved in too much action and too many sub-plots going to really amount to anything coherent. That being said, the fact that this film garnered so much money is certainly an achievement and nothing succeeds like success. But it was all a bit too much for me and I have rated it accordingly.

Major League," Some Major League Humor
","After her rich husband dies and leaves her as the owner of the Cleveland Indians, 'Rachel Phelps' (Margaret Whitton) devises a scheme to relocate the team to Miami. However, in order to do that legally she needs to ensure that attendance at home games falls below 800,000. To that end, she recruits the worst players she can possibly find and anxiously awaits the team's inevitable demise. What she doesn't count on, however, is the player's reaction when they learn of her plan and her total disregard for them as well. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a delightful baseball comedy which had featured good performances by a number of actors. Most notable in that regard was Charlie Sheen (as 'Ricky 'Wild Thing' Vaughn'), Tom Berenger ('Jake Taylor'), Corbin Bernsen ('Roger Dorn') and Wesley Snipes ('Willie Mays Hayes'). Likewise, I also enjoyed the performance by Margaret Whitton who played the part in an expert manner. In short, I found this to be an entertaining comedy and I have rated it accordingly.

The Dark Knight," A Good 'Batman' Movie
","This movie begins with five men wearing clown masks entering a major bank and taking duffel bags filled with money. It's at this time that one particular masked gunman kills his accomplices one by one and subsequently escapes with all of the loot. As it turns out the last surviving robber is a criminal mastermind known as 'the Joker' (Heath Ledger) and he is as psychotic as they come. The scene then shifts to a parking garage where two criminal gangs are having a meeting when suddenly two people dressed as Batman arrive and a shootout ensues. Suddenly the real 'Batman' (Christian Bale) enters the picture and not only subdues the criminals but also the Batman impersonators as well. Needless to say, it's only a matter of time before the Joker and Batman collide head on-and there will be a lot of chaos and mayhem along the way. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that I honestly didn't think anybody could top the performance of Jack Nicholson as the Joker in the 'Batman' movie of 1989. But I am here to say that Heath Ledger totally dominated the Joker persona like nobody else has ever done. He was truly excellent. Likewise, Christian Bale also performed quite well as Batman. Along with that, the movie itself was one of the better 'Batman' films ever produced as well. That being said, I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",7,0,1,11 March 2017
This Is Spinal Tap," Probably Takes Some Getting Used To
","This film is essentially about a so-called heavy metal group named 'Spinal Tap' who have found that their customer base has been shrinking and have therefore launched a come-back tour to recapture their lost glory-as if they ever had any to begin with. Be that as it may, even though their new manager named 'Ian Faith' (Tony Hendra) tries his best to set things up for their United States tour it soon becomes quite obvious that he is totally incompetent for the job at hand. Also quite evident is the fact that the band members are equally clueless about why their music doesn't attract large audiences. So they continue to produce one idiotic song after the other and devise all kinds of failed stage gimmicks in the mistaken belief that they are somehow on the verge of a major breakthrough. When these don't work the manager quits and is replaced by the lead singer's girlfriend 'Jeanine Pettibone' (June Chadwick) who is even more incompetent than Ian ever was. Not surprisingly, things get even worse at that point. In any case, while this turned out to be a decent comedy for the most part, I should also mention that it probably takes some getting used to. Because of that, some viewers may not like it that much and I have rated it accordingly. Average.",5,2,7,7 April 2017
The Mummy Returns," A Film Containing Action and CGI in Lieu of Suspense and Horror
","This film begins in ancient times with a warrior known as 'the Scorpion King' (Dwayne Johnson) amassing an army for which he intends to conquer the known world. To his dismay he is soundly defeated while besieging Thebes and as a consequence he is left wandering in the desert with no food or water. It's then that he prays to the Egyptian god Anubus and promises his soul for the opportuntity to defeat his enemies one last time. True to his word, Anubus grants this request by conjuring up an army of jackal warriors for which the Scorpion King does indeed conquer everything in his path to include the city of Thebes. But as soon as he tastes his hard-fought victory Anubus claims soul of the Scorpion King along with the army given to him. The scene then shifts to five thousand years later with an archeologist named 'Rick O'Connell' (Brendon Frazer) and his wife 'Evelyn O'Connell' in the process of exploring a tomb near ancient Thebes. Also with them is their young son 'Alexander O'Connell' who discovers a small chest which contains a gold bracelet. Upon putting it on his wrist he suddenly sees a vision of where the Scorpion King's sepulcher is located. Not long afterward, the curator of the British Museum resurrects the mummy of 'Imhotep' () who plans on resurrecting the Scorpion King for the purpose of killing him and assuming command of his army in order to conquer the world. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this movie had numerous sub-plots which became rather confusing at time. Likewise, the inclusion of numerous action scenes and CGI in lieu of any noticeable suspense or horror was also a feature which lessened the overall potential this film could have had. Be that as it may, while it certainly wasn't a bad film by any means, it could have been much better and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",6,0,1,26 February 2019

As a result, Ethan has to go underground and find the actual traitor using what few resources are available to him while being targeted by everyone in the agency. On top of that, the people he manages to scrounge up have their own issues which make it extremely difficult for him to trust any of them. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that I thought that this was a pretty good movie which managed to maintain the suspense from start-to-finish rather well. It also had a very intricate plot and for that reason viewers have to stay alert throughout the movie or risk missing a vital piece of the puzzle. In any case, I enjoyed this film and I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",7,1,1,26 January 2017
The Last Samurai," A Very Entertaining Action Film
","This film begins in 1876 with a Samurai warlord by the name of 'Katsumoto' (Ken Watanabe) meditating on a hill in Japan and having an eerie vision of a white tiger fighting for its life in an extremely fierce and desperate battle. The scene then shifts to a small town in America where a Medal-of-Honor winner named 'Captain Nathan Algren' (Tom Cruise) is demonstrating to the crowd the capabilities of a brand new Winchester repeating rifle. Not long afterward he is recruited to come to Japan to teach Japanese soldiers how to fight using Western weapons and techniques to be used primarily against an internal rebellion of Samurai warriors led by none other than--Katsumoto. Accompanying him is a former commander he intensely dislikes by the name of 'Colonel Bagley' (Tony Goldwyn) along with a respected comrade-in-arms named 'Sergeant Zebulon Gant' (Billy Connolly). Yet, even though he is strictly a military adviser it is only a matter of time before Captain Algren and his raw recruits meet Katsumoto and his highly-skilled samurai on the field of battle-and neither of them will be the same afterward. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a very entertaining action film which managed to capture the turmoil and anguish brought on by the Meiji Restoration in a superb manner. Likewise, the performances of Ken Watanable and Tom Cruise were also first-rate as well. In short, I enjoyed this film and I definitely recommend it to those who might be interested.",8,1,3,12 April 2017
A Clockwork Orange," Incredibly Shocking and Disturbing for Its Time
","Set in a dystopian future a young hoodlum named 'Alex' (Malcolm McDowell) roams the streets at night with three of his fellow gang members and stirs up as much chaos and mayhem as he can. He especially enjoys violence and inflicts it upon those who are too weak to defend themselves. However, things begin to change when he has an argument with one of the people in his group and discovers that his hold on his gang isn't as strong as he previously thought. It's at this time that he is set up by his friends and once abandoned is sent to prison for murder. But even inside the prison he remains defiant and continues to try to manipulate the system to his advantage. Now rather than reveal any more of this movie and risk spoiling this film for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this picture established a reputation as being incredibly shocking and disturbing for its time. As a matter of fact it apparently still retains its 'X rating' to this day even though there have been other films with as much violence and nudity as this particular movie. Even so this film is definitely not for general audiences and viewer discretion is advised.",8,0,2,16 April 2015

At that particular time their spirits were high as the German army was in the process of advancing victoriously into Russia. But all that was subject to change as their next assignment would be: Stalingrad. And they had no idea what was in store for them. At any rate, told from the German perspective, this film does a remarkable job of showing the hardships and tragedy these soldiers had to endure. Despite proving themselves in battle, their courage and discipline was being tested as much by the Russian winter as it was their Russian foes. And yet they continued on all the same. Now, while everybody knows how this battle eventually played out, this movie allows the viewer to gain a unique understanding of how it may have appeared through the eyes of the German soldier. Definitely worth a watch for those who can appreciate a film of this type.",8,8,9,17 April 2013
Where Eagles Dare," Action and Pyrotechnics
","After an American general is captured by the Nazis a top-secret plan involving a small group of commandos is put together to try to rescue him. In charge of the operation is a British officer by the name of 'Major John Smith' (Richard Burton). Also in this squad is an American, 'Lieutenant Schaffer' (Clint Eastwood). Unfortunately, this is no ordinary extraction since the general is being held prisoner in a heavily guarded castle in an extremely mountainous part of Germany. Not only that, but there is also a traitor within the group who is determined to thwart any rescue attempt. At any rate, rather than detail any more of the film and risk ruining it for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this movie has more than its fair share of action and pyrotechnics. Too much in some cases as any semblance of realism disappears about half-way through the movie. Even so it's still manages to entertain fairly well. All things considered I rate it as slightly above average.",6,2,5,7 August 2014
Total Recall," An Exciting Action-Packed Sci-Fi Film
","This film begins many years in the future with a man named 'Dennis Quaid' (Arnold Schwarzenegger) waking up from a nightmare about being killed while on the planet Mars. Fortunately, his wife 'Lori' (Sharon Stone) is right there and immediately consoles him to where he subsequently forgets about it and goes to work. While at work he asks a colleague about a new virtual vacation program advertised on television and even though his friend warns him about it he decides to go to the clinic and spend some money on it anyway. It's then that something goes horribly wrong as he suddenly begins to have delusions of being a fugitive from a secret agency. Not only that but on his way back home he is attacked and almost killed by people he thought were his friends-and this includes his wife Lori. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an exciting action-packed sci-fi film which had an interesting plot that takes several sharp turns with some unique special effects along the way. Additionally, having a beautiful actress like Sharon Stone certainly didn't hurt this picture either. Be that as it may, I enjoyed the particular movie and have rated it accordingly. Above average.",7,0,0,2 November 2018
Rocky," Intense Action and Drama
","'Rocky Balboa' (Sylvester Stallone) is a boxer who struggles just trying to make ends meets in the city of Philadelphia. Although he certainly isn't the brightest person around he has a big heart and does the best that he can. Yet even then he realizes that he is going nowhere fast. Then one day he gets a call from a man who wants to schedule a fight between him and the undisputed Heavyweight Champion of the World who goes by the name 'Apollo Creed' (Carl Weathers). At first Rocky refuses because he doesn't believe he is in the same class as the World Champion and doesn't deserve the honor. However, he eventually comes around and gets more serious about his training. But even then he has grave doubts about his chances. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a very good movie which really highlights the importance of never giving up and always trying to do your best in spite of the odds. Admittedly, the first hour or so is quite slow but during this time it provides the character development necessary for the intense action and drama in the second hour. This is especially true for Talia Shire (as Rocky's girlfriend 'Adrian') and the aforementioned Sylvester Stallone. At any rate, I thoroughly enjoyed this film and recommend it to those who might be interested in a movie of this type.",8,2,2,24 December 2015
Hoosiers," Captures the Basketball Climate of Indiana in an Excellent Manner
","'Norman Dale' (Gene Hackman) was a college basketball coach for 10 years until an incident force him to leave and subsequently join the Navy. Now, 12 years later, he has returned to the profession he loves by accepting a coaching position for a high school in Indiana. However, the people in this small town take basketball extremely serious and they aren't nearly as enthusiastic to his new methods as he would like. To make matters even worse he only has 6 players on the team with one key holdout named 'Jimmy Chitwood' (Maris Valainis) deciding not to play the entire season. That being said, when the team gets off to a rocky start everyone in town begins to call for his scalp. But he remains determined in spite of everything that has gone wrong. The question is whether he can turn things around before he gets fired. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that having spent a little time in Indiana this film did an excellent job of capturing the basketball climate as well as presenting the small town atmosphere there during that particular time also. Truly excellent. Additionally, along with the aforementioned Gene Hackman, I also liked the performances of Barbara Hershey (as 'Myra Fleener') and Dennis Hopper ('Shooter') as well. In any case, this is one of those few movies that I can watch over and over again and I have rated it accordingly. Definitely above average.",8,1,1,22 February 2017
Jack Reacher," Suspense, Mystery and Action Throughout
","An army sniper named 'James Barr' (Joseph Sikora) kills 5 innocent people at random in Pittsburgh. When he is caught and interrogated he writes down 3 words on a piece of paper: 'Get Jack Reacher'. Not long afterward he is beaten up while in police custody and lies in a hospital bed in a coma. Out of nowhere the mysterious man named 'Jack Reacher' (Tom Cruise) appears and reluctantly decides to investigate the case on his own without the help or concurrence of the Pittsburgh police department. But as he continues he realizes that what should have been an open and shut case isn't necessarily true. Anyway, from an entertainment perspective this film is very enjoyable. Tom Cruise does an excellent job and the chemistry between him and Rosamund Pike (as 'Helen') is definitely noticeable even if it wasn't actually realized. There is suspense, mystery and action throughout the film and I recommend it to those who enjoy movies of this type. Above average.",7,4,7,5 July 2013
Les Misérables," Follows the Book Quite Faithfully
","With no money to buy food and his niece facing death by starvation, 'Jean Valjean' (Hugh Jackman) decides to steal a loaf of bread from a nearby store. Unfortunately, he is caught and sentenced to 5 years at hard labor. During this time he attempts to escape more than once and each time his sentence is lengthened. Eventually, after 19 years in prison he is finally released on parole. Unable to find a job he steals from a church but is once again caught. But this time fate smiles at him as the local priest gives him total absolution and he is allowed to depart with the stolen goods. Ashamed for his actions he decides to start a new life and tears up his parole papers as a sign of his determination. However, having done so he now becomes a wanted criminal and a certain law enforcement official named 'Javert' (Russell Crowe) is determined to find him regardless of what it takes. Now rather than reveal any more of this movie and risk spoiling it for those who haven't seen it I will just say that it follows the book quite faithfully. That said it's rather long (158 minutes) and a large portion of it is performed in song. A very large portion. Even so most of it was quite entertaining and I recommend it to those who enjoy musicals of this type. Above average.",7,1,1,30 December 2014
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," A Family Reunion of Sorts
","After retrieving some valuable batteries to the Sovereign race the Guardians of the Galaxy are compensated in the process by having a female outlaw named 'Nebula' (Karen Gillan) handed over to them. As it so happens, Nebula was imprisoned by the Sovereign race because she had tried to steal the same batteries that the Guardians have safely returned. Additionally, Nebula just happens to be the estranged sister of 'Gamora' (Zoe Saldana) as well. In any case, after the Guardians of the Galaxy depart they soon discover that one of their own members has kept some of the batteries for himself-and because of that they are now the targets of the same people who had employed them earlier. To make matters even more complicated, while trying to escape from the Sovereigns they encounter a man named 'Ego' (Kurt Russell) who claims to be the father of 'Peter Quill' (Chris Pratt). But what they don't realize is that Ego has a secret agenda that he only plans to reveal when the time is right. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that-as in the first movie-fans who enjoy lots of CGI and action will probably love this particular film. And while I was quite impressed with the CGI, I must admit that-once again-I didn't consider this movie to be as good as the marketing and hype surrounding it. To further elaborate, I found the acting to be rather mediocre and I didn't think that the humor was very sharp either. That being said, while it wasn't necessarily a bad movie by any means, I thought it could have been much better and I have rated it accordingly. Average.",5,0,0,22 November 2018
The Da Vinci Code," A Conspiracy Theory Within a Conspiracy Theory
","This film essentially begins with a man by the name of 'Jacques Saunière' (Jean-Pierre Marielle) being fatally shot in the Louvre by an assassin known simply as 'Silas' (Paul Bettany). As it so happens, Jacques is not only the curator of the Louvre but also the grand master of a secret fraternal organization known as the Priory of Sion. And it's because of his association with the Priory of Sion that Jacques is killed. However, before he is shot, Silas extracts a key bit of information before leaving him alone on the floor to bleed to death. Not long afterward, a professor of religious symbols by the name of 'Robert Langdon' (Tom Hanks) is summoned to the Louvre by the French investigator named 'Captain Bezu Fache' (Jean Reno) to ostensibly help solve the case. What Robert Langdon doesn't realize, however, is that Captain Fache has another reason for requesting his presence and if not for the timely intervention of an attractive woman named 'Sophie Neveu' (Audrey Tautou) he would have been arrested shortly afterward. It's then that both Robert and Sophie begin on a desperate quest for the Holy Grail and their lives will never be the same from that point on. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an entertaining mystery film which took a number of twists and turns along the way. On the other hand, however, I must also mention that much of the film was based on a number of half-baked conspiracy theories which should cause anybody with a rudimentary grasp of history to shake their heads in disbelief. Again, it was entertaining-but it was also quite nonsensical as well. That being said, I can fully appreciate any apprehension a viewer might have with regard to their rating. That being the case, had it not contained so many obvious and blatant historical inaccuracies, I would have rated it higher.",6,0,0,19 September 2019
Rocky III," My Favorite Rocky Movie
","After defeating 'Apollo Creed' (Carl Weathers) in another epic bout, 'Rocky Balboa' (Sylvester Stallone) now turns his attention to defending his world heavyweight title by defeating 10 different challengers over the course of 3 years. However, there is one challenger his manager 'Micky Goldmill' (Burgess Meredith) has not scheduled and his name is 'Clubber Lang' (Mr. T) who has advanced through the rankings and has now become the #1 challenger. Yet even though Rocky wants to postpone his retirement and fight Clubber Lang, Mickey still wants nothing to do with it because he has seen just how powerful Clubber Lang is and doesn't think fighting him is in Rocky's best interest. But Rocky persists and Mickey reluctantly agrees. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that--even though it may not be the best in the series--it is my favorite of the bunch. Admittedly, it's not as deep as 'Rocky' or even possibly 'Rocky II'. But it has more action and excitement. Likewise, despite the fact that Mr. T was nominated for a 'Razzie Award' for his performance, I thought he performed rather well given his particular role. Additionally, I thought Carl Weathers did a fine job as well. In any case, while it may not have been up to the same standard as 'Rocky', I thought it was still quite enjoyable and I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",7,0,0,7 January 2016
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," A Fantasy Film Suitable for the Entire Family
","Orphaned not long after his birth, 'Harry Potter' (Daniel Radcliffe) is forced to live in the home of his only living relatives who treat him rather badly. That all changes one day when he is informed by a man named 'Rebeus Hagrid' (Robbie Coltrane) that his parents were famous magicians and because of that he is invited to attend the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Needless to say, Harry accepts almost immediately and after Hagrid and he buy the necessary school equipment he begins his journey to the mystical academy. It's then that he meets two fellow students named 'Ron Weasley' (Rupert Grint) and 'Hermione Granger' (Emma Watson) who become his good friends and share in his triumphs and travails. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film was based on the very successful book 'Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone' by J.K. Rowling and from what I understand remains quite faithful to the book. At least for the most part. In any case, I found it to be a fine fantasy film with the interaction between Harry and his two friends especially entertaining. Admittedly, there are some slow parts here and there and it does run a bit long (152 minutes). Even so, despite the faults just mentioned, I believe this to be one of those rare movies which can be enjoyed by the entire family and I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",7,0,0,2 September 2017
Thor," One of the Best 'Comic Book' Movies Ever Made
","In the realm known as Asgard, 'Thor' (Chris Hemsworth) is about to be sworn in as the new king by his father 'Odin' (Anthony Hopkins). Out of jealousy his brother 'Loki' (Tom Hiddleston) arranges for some Frost Giants to appear which causes the ceremony to be interrupted. While Odin considers the incident as an unfortunate inconvenience, Thor believes it to be a violation of a peace agreement between Asgard and the Frost Giants and decides to venture to Jotunheim to teach them a lesson. Odin commands him not to take matters into his own hands. Thor disobeys and with a few companions ventures to the kingdom of the Frost Giants anyway. This turns out to be a big mistake as Thor and his friends are surrounded and would have been killed had Odin not suddenly appeared to rescue them in the nick of time. Once back in Asgard Odin is furious and casts Thor down to Earth as a mortal human being. Anyway, rather than detail the rest of the story and risk spoiling the film for those who haven't seen it, I will just say that I think that this is one of the best 'comic book' movies ever made. It has plenty of action but it doesn't go overboard with it. It also has good CGI but doesn't rely too heavily upon it either. It has some nice humor but even more important--it has a good plot. Definitely above average.",8,0,1,30 December 2013
Zombieland," Lacking in Several Aspects
","As some of the other scores and critics have clearly indicated, this is a movie that you will either love or hate. There doesn't seem to be much in-between. Personally, I thought the movie was lacking in several aspects. First, it wasn't that funny. As a matter of fact, I thought the entire scenario with Bill Murray was incredibly simplistic and a waste of time. It was simply awful. Likewise, there was absolutely no chemistry between the characters. Woody Harrelson (as 'Tallahassee') showed no personality while Emma Stone (as 'Wichita') was dull and uninspired. They're better actors than that and their talents were wasted. Further, the character of 'Little Rock' (Abigal Breslin) was totally unnecessary and she seemed to drag the picture down with her. About the only good thing was the acting of Jessie Eisenberg (as 'Columbus') who was likable but couldn't carry the movie all by himself. Again, the plot was jumbled and nothing really came together. At any rate, those viewers who wish to watch this movie can decide for themselves. They should know whether they like it or not by the end of the first 30 minutes or so. It doesn't get any better or worse.",3,2,7,11 December 2012
Enemy at the Gates," An Action-Packed War Film
","In late 1941 the German Army was crushing everything in sight and was moving deep into Russian territory. Then they came to Stalingrad, and despite the fact that they continued to inflict heavy casualties upon the Russian Army (and Russian civilians), they couldn't break through to the other side of the Volga River. So, with both sides dug in behind every rock and crevice, the snipers took over. On the Russian side was a young soldier named 'Vassili Zaitzev' (Jude Law) who became legendary due to the efforts of a comrade by the name of 'Commisar Danilov' (Joseph Fiennes) who happened to work for the propaganda department of the Communist Party. On the German side was 'Major Konig' (Fred Harris) who was perhaps the best sniper in all of Germany. But this story goes much deeper than that as it is filled with intrigue, drama and tragedy. Now, being an American it is difficult for me to really cheer for either side as they were both led by evil murderous tyrants. But this is a story more about human courage and sacrifice than it is about any specific evil person or ideology. And that is what makes this film so compelling. The action was plentiful but unlike so many other 'action films' this one had good acting as well. I especially liked the performances of Jude Law and Joseph Fiennes. But in any case, this is a movie that should definitely appeal to those who enjoy an action-packed war film. Definitely above average.",7,1,2,26 April 2013
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," A Bit Darker but No Less Entertaining Than Its Predecessor
","This film essentially begins where its predecessor 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' left off with 'Harry Potter' (Daniel Radcliffe) leaving the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry for the summer. Naturally, since his only living relatives weren't very nice to him previously he dreads the thought of spending staying with them. Sure enough, they waste little time in making his life miserable and doing everything they can to prevent him from conversing with his friends or going back to Hogwarts. Then one day he gets a visit from a goblin named 'Dobby' (voice supplied by Toby Jones) who also does everything he can to prevent him from going back as well-and the reason is more sinister than either of them realize. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that I thought this sequel was just as good as the movie before it due in large part to the darker and more intriguing plot. However, like the first film, it does run a bit long (161 minutes) so that might be one consideration for those wishing to watch it. Even so, it was still quite enjoyable and I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",7,1,1,8 September 2017
Psycho," Awesome
","An attractive woman by the name of 'Marion Crane' (Janet Leigh) steals $40,000 from her office then heads for California in a hurry. After being followed by a cop she pulls over at a used car dealership and trades her car for another before setting out again. That night it begins to rain hard and she decides to stay the night at a motel along an old highway-the Bates Motel. From that point on things begin to happen in a most dramatic fashion. Now, rather than reveal the details I will just say that this is one of the best horror movies ever filmed. It has good acting, good directing, excellent cinematography, plenty of mystery and awesome suspense. Along with that, one particular scene involving Janet Leigh in the shower is possibly one of the most memorable horror scenes ever filmed. Having said that I believe it should be pointed out that this movie is 53 years old (at the time of this review) and as a result it doesn't have the graphic imagery or gore that some people are accustomed to today. As a result there could be some viewers who might miss the subtle touches a real master like Alfred Hitchcock was able to implement to such a fine degree. Equally impressive was the acting of both Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins (as 'Norman Bates'). As a matter of fact, Janet Leigh was nominated for an Academy Award and won a Golden Globe Award for 'Best Actress' for her performance. In short, while this movie is definitely a bit old it is still worth watching for all fans of horror or suspense.",9,0,1,14 December 2013
30 Days of Night," A Good, Action-Packed Horror Movie
","There are several good things about this film that differentiates it from the average vampire story line. The idea of using a small, Arctic town like Barrow, Alaska, creates all kinds of unique opportunities that most movies of this genre don't have available to them. For example, because of its geographic location it has '30 days of night' which gives the vampires a totally new lethal capability as they now have 24 hours in a day to wreck havoc. And they take maximum advantage of this new opportunity. Additionally, the extreme winter environment and the geographic isolation provide a new set of difficulties for the humans in their desperate attempt to stay alive. Another difference is the ugliness of these vampires and their behavior which is much more savage than most 'typical' vampires presented in films today. They enjoy tormenting their prey. As far as the film is concerned, it was nominated in 2008 for a Saturn Award for 'Best Horror Film' along with 'Best Makeup'. It boasts plenty of action but this detracts a bit from the overall acting performances. While both Josh Hartnett (playing the lead character of Sheriff 'Eben Oleson') and Melissa George (playing his estranged wife 'Stella Oleson') performed adequately, the rest of the characters weren't well-developed and it showed. All in all though, this was a good, action-packed horror movie that makes good use of the dark ambiance and original concepts.",7,3,4,1 October 2012
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Inconsistent and Uneven Retelling of the Dracula Story
","This film begins in 1462 with the Muslim Turks attempting to take over the region near Constantinople with only one army led by a Romanian knight left to stop them. Although the Romanian army successfully defeats the Turks, the wife of the warrior leading the defense commits suicide in the mistaken belief that her husband has died in the battle. Upon learning this-and feeling that God has betrayed him-the Romanian knight declares allegiance to the powers of darkness and is transformed into the vampire known as 'Dracula' (Gary Oldman). From that point on he kills and feeds upon the blood of everyone within his reach until one day, 4 centuries later, he decides to relocate to London. And it's there that he sees an attractive woman named 'Mina Murray' (Winona Ryder) who looks exactly like his long lost love which compels him he to reunite with her at all costs. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film had some good points to it but, unfortunately, the further on it continued the more inconsistent and uneven it became. I also didn't quite like the appearance of Dracula who looked quite ridiculous at times. In any case, based on these criticisms I have to rate this film accordingly.",4,2,4,8 May 2019
American Gangster," One of the Best Gangster Movies Out There
","After his mentor is killed, 'Frank Lucas' (Denzel Washington) decides to assume his former boss' place as the key drug dealer in Harlem. However, there are other drug lords who have also been waiting for this opportunity and they have decided to move into this territory as well. Because of that Frank takes a huge gamble and, rather than dealing with established middle men for his heroin, decides to procure his product directly from an original source-Thailand. This results in his being able to obtain pure heroin and cut it up to his own standards which happens to be of a better quality and for a cheaper price than anybody else can match in New York. Needless to say, this increases his customer base at the expense of the Mafia. And that doesn't make them very happy. It also increases his visibility to various law enforcement agencies for completely different reasons. Some want him off the streets while those more corrupt want to share in the profits. Regardless, a lot of people suddenly become interested in him and that means trouble-for everyone. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this is one of the better drug-related movies out there with Denzel Washington performing in a very excellent manner. Russell Crowe (as 'Detective Richie Roberts') also performs well but make no mistake-this is Denzel Washington's movie all the way. In any case, I enjoyed this movie and have rated it accordingly. Definitely above average.",8,1,2,28 March 2016
The Mission," A Slow but Powerful Film
","'Rodrigo Mendoza' (Robert De Niro) is a slave trader in South America who kills his own brother in a fit of jealous rage. Although he is not convicted by any court he still regrets his action and because of that he shuts himself out of society in a nearby church. Eventually, he decides to seek forgiveness by doing an extremely difficult penance. When that is finally accomplished he becomes a Jesuit monk working at a newly built mission far inside the jungle helping the same tribe he had tried to enslave. Unfortunately, time doesn't stop and all too soon other slave traders appear with the main goal of tearing down all of the missions in the area thereby ending any refuge for the unfortunate Indian tribesmen. Now rather than reveal any more of this movie I will just say this was a slow but powerful film which manages to capture the beautiful scenery of South America along with the power and greed prevalent during this particular time in history. It also won several awards including the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival along with being nominated for 'Best Picture' at the Academy Awards. Again, while it's rather slow at times, it's still something worth viewing for those who might be interested in this type of film.",7,3,3,27 December 2015
Jaws," Definitely Above Average
","This is one of those rare films that has won so many awards that it's hard to keep up with them. For example, it won two Academy Awards for 'Best Sound' and 'Best Film Editing'. It was also nominated for an Academy Award for 'Best Picture' and while it didn't win on that particular night it later did win a Golden Globe award for 'Best Motion Picture-Drama'. Likewise, Richard Dreyfuss won a BAFTA award for his performance as the oceanographer named 'Matt Hooper'. And there were other awards and nominations as well. In all it was quite impressive. Now, as far as the movie is concerned, this is definitely one that I can recommend to all but the very young and faint-hearted. Although there isn't much gore, graphic language or nudity it still has enough drama and suspense to keep a person's interest throughout most of the movie. Personally, while I thought the special effects were more than adequate for that specific time period, I still would have preferred a bit more gore to make it seem even more realistic. Additionally, I thought some of the film got a bit bogged down by the dialogue-especially while the three main characters, 'Sheriff Brody' (Roy Schieder), 'Captain Quint' (Robert Shaw) and the aforementioned 'Matt Hooper' were at sea waiting for the shark to appear. Even so this was a very good movie and as proof of that one need only look at the number of sequels, clones and similar movies which have been spawned (no pun intended) due to it. Definitely above average.",8,5,9,17 April 2014
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," A Notch Above Its Predecessor
","This movie picks up at the exact same spot that its predecessor ('The Hobbit-The Desolation of Smaug') left off with the dragon known as Smaug in the process of destroying Laketown. Likewise as a prequel to 'The Lord of the Rings-The Fellowship of the Ring' it ends at the same spot where the later film begins. In other words this movie fits right in and ties 'The Hobbit' trilogy in with the three 'Lord of the Rings' films quite nicely. That said, I would strongly recommend that a person new to these movies begin with 'The Hobbit-An Unexpected Journey' and then continue on through 'The Hobbit' series before beginning on 'The Lord of the Rings' movies if at all possible to gain a better understanding and appreciation for this particular film. Of course if a person has read all of the books in the 'Tolkien series' then perhaps that might not be necessary. However that's just my opinion and I suppose a person can perhaps still enjoy this movie without any previous knowledge. In any case, I found this movie to be a notch above its predecessor and I believe that fans of this genre will certainly like this movie as much as they did all of the others. Accordingly, I rate this film as above average.",7,6,11,1 January 2015
Bring It On," A Bevy of Attractive Actresses
","This movie begins with a high school student named 'Torrence Shipman' (Kirsten Dunst) being selected as the captain of the cheerleading team. Needless to say, this is a great honor. However, in this particular case the previous cheerleading teams have won the national championships for 5 years in a row and everybody expects this year's team to be no different. That being said, things start off rather badly when one of the cheerleaders is injured and put out of commission at the very first practice. Needless to say, finding a qualified replacement on such short notice is an extremely difficult task but, as luck would have it, just when things looked extremely bleak a new student by the name of 'Missy Pantone' (Eliza Dushku) auditions and agrees to take the empty spot so that things can begin to proceed as normal. Unfortunately, just prior to their first competition Torrence learns that the cheers they have worked on for so long have been stolen from another school and to continue with them would severly impact their chances. Not only that, but the team who invented the cheers are extremely good and intend on proving themselves in the national championships as well. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an okay comedy for the most part with a few good laughs to be had here and there. Likewise, having a bevy of attractive actresses like Clare Kramer (as 'Courtney'), Nicole Bilderback ('Whitney'), Gabrielle Union ('Isis'), Tsianina Joelson ('Darcy') and the aforementioned Kirsten Dunst certainly didn't hurt either. On the other hand, however, I must admit that some of the drama was a bit clichéd and the overall plot was rather predictable as well. All things being equal, I suppose it managed to pass the time well enough and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Average.",5,13,13,20 October 2018
Defiance," An Intense Movie
","After witnessing their Belarussian village being slaughtered in cold blood by Nazis a couple of Jews escape into a heavy forested area to consider how they can get their revenge. However, other Jewish refugees soon join them and it soon becomes apparent to these men that they have to rearrange their priorities from getting revenge to taking care of these desperate people. At least that is what the leader of the group named 'Tuvia Bielski' (Daniel Craig) believes. His brother, 'Zus Bielski' (Liev Schreiber) wants to take the fight to the Nazis and after awhile joins a brigade of Russian partisans to do exactly that. This movie captures the story of both of these brothers and the challenges that each of them have to face. Now rather than reveal any more of the movie and risk ruining it for those who haven't seen it, I will just say that this was an intense movie which did an excellent job in displaying the courage and perseverance of this small band of Jewish people living in Eastern Europe during this particular time. Definitely a good and memorable movie.",8,1,2,26 January 2015

The Waterboy," A Football Superstar Waiting to be Unleashed
","'Bobby Boucher' (Adam Sandler) is a nice, young man who has had the misfortune of being without a father since the moment he was born and also having a domineering mother known simply as 'Mama Boucher' (Kathy Bates) who won't let him do anything without her approval. He is also rather naïve and dim-witted as well and it's because of this that he is content to serve as the waterboy for a team that not only doesn't appreciate him--but bullies him at every opportunity. Then one day, because he is the team's scapegoat, he is fired by the vicious and mean-spirited coach named 'Red Beaulieu' (Jerry Reed) fires him for no reason. So with nothing else to lose Bobby decides to seek employment at another nearby college. To his surprise, he is eagerly accepted by 'Coach Klein' (Henry Winkler) who is only too glad to have somebody help his rather beleaguered team any way they can. And not long afterward Coach Klein discovers that underneath the mild-mannered and fragile exterior of his waterboy lies a football superstar waiting to be unleashed upon the sports world. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a cute comedy which featured some good performances by all of the aforementioned actors. Unfortunately, it also had a few scenes which lacked both humor and taste and this caused the film to seem somewhat uneven. Be that as it may, it was still entertaining for the most part and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Average.",5,1,1,5 October 2018
The Terminal," A Touching Comedy
","On his way to New York City to resolve a personal matter, 'Viktor Navorski' (Tom Hanks) becomes victimized by a civil war in his home country which leaves him in a curious situation. In essence, since his government no longer exists his passport and visa are no longer valid. That means that he cannot go back and he cannot enter the United States. So with no other options the temporary head of Homeland Security at JFK Airport 'Frank Dixon' (Stanley Tucci) decides to detain him for the time-being in the international terminal there. Unfortunately, as the civil war drags on with no clear resolution, Viktor is left homeless for weeks on end with only a couple of employees there as friends. Yet despite all of this he remains resolute in his determination to finish what he set out to initially accomplish. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an especially cute and endearing film which captured my attention from start-to-finish. Admittedly, there were a few slow parts here and there but they were definitely made up for by the frequent comedy, romance and drama scenes which flowed all around. On that note, while Tom Hanks was quite impressive, I also liked the performance of Kumar Pallana (as 'Gupta Rajan') who I thought was absolutely hilarious. Likewise, having two attractive actresses like Catherine Zeta-Jones ('Amilia Warren') and Zoe Saldana ('Dolores Torres') certainly didn't hurt in any way either. Be that as it may, I thoroughly enjoyed this film and have rated it accordingly. Definitely above average.",8,0,0,4 August 2019
The Cannonball Run," Good Cast but Lukewarm Comedy
","This film essentially begins with certain people from all over the world competing in an illegal car race starting in Connecticut and finishing in Los Angeles, California. Naturally, being quite competitive and having already raced against each other previously, all of the drivers seek to gain some kind of an edge over everybody else which will propel them to victory. In one particular case, 'J. J. McClure' (Burt Reynolds) and his partner 'Victor Prinzim' (Dom DeLuise) have decided to drive an ambulance which will allow them to bypass certain restrictions typically enforced on everyone else. Likewise, 'Jamie Blake' (Dean Martin) and 'Fenderbaum' (Sammy Davis Jr.) pose as priests in the belief that it will confer some kind of advantage along the way as well. Anything to win. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an okay comedy which was inspired by an actual series of illegal coast-to-coast races in the 70's known as the 'Cannonball Baker Sea-To-Shining-Sea Memorial Trophy Dash'. Yet, despite the fact that it had an all-star cast, the overall comedy wasn't that impressive and for that reason I have rated this film accordingly. Average.",5,0,0,17 July 2019
Halloween," A Definite Pioneer in Its Class
","This movie begins on October 31st, 1963 in Haddonfield, Illinois with a 6-year old boy fatally stabbing and killing his older sister. Because he is so young he is incarcerated in an insane asylum. Fifteen years later 'Michael Myers' (Tony Moran) escapes and heads back to the same small town with the same psychotic mindset. Attempting to apprehend him is a psychiatrist by the name of 'Dr. Sam Loomis' (Donald Pleasance) who treated him during those years and fully understands just how evil Michael really is. But in order to stop Michael he has to find him first. Now, as far as this movie is concerned I will just say that this particular film was a definite pioneer in its class in that it took over where movies like 'Psycho' and 'The Town That Dreaded Sundown' left off and brought everything to the next level. I especially liked the way the music and atmosphere combined to heighten the suspense and sense of foreboding. Likewise, the fact that it was so financially successful led to a large number of clones and sequels over the course of the next decade (or two). At any rate, even though it isn't perfect, if you like horror movies then this is one that you definitely need to check out. Above average.",7,0,1,14 August 2014
Wonder Woman," Plenty of Action and an Interesting Plot
","Born of the ancient Greek gods, 'Diana' (Gal Gadot) lives on a isolated and unchartered island with the Amazons who train her to be the most skilled warrior possible. Then one day she sees an airplane in the skies which crashes in the ocean near the island and she rushes out to save the occupant. It's then that she discovers that this person is a man-and she has never seen one before as her entire island is populated by females. But before she can get much information from him the island is attacked by German soldiers who are eventually killed in a very fierce battle. Not long afterward she is told that his name is 'Captain Steve Trevor' (Chris Pine) and he is an American soldier working with British Intelligence. Not only that, but he also tells her that the entire world is involved in a war on the scale of something that has never happened before. So having already witnessed the ruthlessness of the Germans, she decides to go with Captain Trevor to London to track down and kill the individual responsible-Aires, the God of War. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a pretty good 'Comic Book movie' which had plenty of action and an interesting plot. Likewise, the presence of an attractive actress like Gal Gadot certainly didn't hurt matters either. Be that as it may, I enjoyed this film and have rated it accordingly.",7,3,7,10 May 2019
The Silence of the Lambs," On the Trail of a Serial Killer nicknamed 'Buffalo Bill'
","A serial killer nicknamed 'Buffalo Bill' (Ted Levine) gains even more notoriety after kidnapping a woman by the name of 'Catherine Martin' (Brooke Smith) who happens to be the daughter of United States Senator 'Ruth Martin' (Diane Baker). Although he hasn't cooperated since his arrest and conviction for several grisly murders, a former psychiatrist named 'Dr. Hannibal Lector' (Anthony Hopkins) is persuaded to do so by a young FBI agent-in-training named 'Clarice Starling' (Jodie Foster). But with time on his side any assistance he gives will come at a very high price. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a fascinating movie from start to finish with Academy Award winning performances rendered by both Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster. It also won the Academy Award for 'Best Picture' as well. In any case, I highly recommend this film for those who might enjoy a movie of this type and I have rated it accordingly.",9,3,5,26 April 2016
The Dark Knight Rises," As Good as its Predecessor
","This movie essentially begins with a eulogy for a district attorney named who died in a fight against 'Batman' (Christian Bale) eight years earlier. Ironically, the battle ended up with the corrupt district attorney being considered a hero while Batman was cast as an evil murderer and additionally 'Bruce Wayne' became a partial invalid and a total recluse in the process. Then one day during a benefit at his house a maid ventures into Bruce Wayne's bedroom and proceeds to steal some pearls out of his safe--but more importantly obtains copies of his fingerprints as well. Not long afterward it is revealed that a former mercenary named 'Bain' (Tom Hardy) is building a criminal organization with the intention of terrorizing Gotham City and using those fingerprints to take over Bruce Wayne's fortune as well. Along with that a female burger with her own unique skills makes her presence known and sets out with her own agenda as the 'Catwoman' (Anne Hathaway). Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film was as good as its predecessor with both Christian Bale and Anne Hathaway putting in some fine performances. Although, it was a bit long (164 minutes) and could have provided a bit more introductory detail relating to the previous film ('The Dark Knight') I thought it still turned out to be a good action movie and I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",7,0,1,18 March 2017
Black Panther," The Protector of His People
","This film essentially begins in ancient times with a meteorite composed of an incredible metal known as 'vibranium' crashing into an area of Africa which is inhabited by 5 different tribes. Eventually, 4 of the tribes join together to form the nation known as Wakanda and use this new metal to advance their technology beyond anything the world has ever known. Equally important is the fact that a rare herb grown in that part of the world has been affected by the radiation from vibranium and, when ingested, gives a person superhuman abilities. This person is known as the Black Panther and he not only becomes the King of Wakanda but also serves as the protector for his people. Anyway, thousands of years pass and while the rest of the world advances Wakanda remains in geographical isolation and is thought of as an extremely backward country. But little does the world realize that Wakanda has technology beyond that of Western civilization and has chosen to remain isolated for fear of what might happen if their technology-and most importantly their vibranium-were to get in the wrong hands. That being said, when some vibranium is stolen the Black Panther is forced to go to America in secret and deal with the situation personally. Little does he know that his actions will have extreme repercusions for the rest of the world. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an excellent 'comic book' movie that combined a dynamic plot, good acting and plentiful action throughout. I especially liked the acting of both Chadwick Boseman (as 'T'Challa') and Michael B. Jordan ('Erik Killmonger') who seemed tailor-made for their parts. On the flip side, however, I must also say that there were some minor flaws in the CGI and that I didn't especially care for the character of 'Shuri' (Letitia Wright) who was unnecessarily annoying. But that aside, I enjoyed this film overall and I have rated it accordingly.",8,1,3,19 October 2018
Iron Man," Above Average
","'Tony Stark' (Robert Downing Jr.) is a wealthy industrialist who specializes in the making of military hardware. While in Afghanistan demonstrating a new missile system he is seriously injured while being kidnapped by militants. Fortunately a doctor who was also kidnapped named 'Yinsen' (Shaun Tomb) manages to keep Tony alive with a new device that is hooked up to his heart and powered by a car battery. Effective but crude. Naturally, it isn't long before Tony manages to make some improvements upon it in order to allow him greater mobility and a better power source. Once that is accomplished he then sets about creating an armored suit for himself while his captors think he is building his new missile system for them. Anyway, rather than disclosing all of the details let me just say that at first I wasn't expecting too much from this movie figuring that it was nothing but action and CGI. And while it definitely has both of these elements it also has some great humor and pretty good acting as well. Along with that, Gwyneth Paltrow (as 'Pepper Potts') and Leslie Bibb ('Christine Everhart') also add some rather nice scenery. In short, this turned out to be an extremely pleasant surprise for me and I heartedly recommend this movie for all audiences. Above average.",7,0,3,22 December 2013
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," A Battle to the Death
","This movie essentially begins where the film 'Man of Steel' ended except that it comes from the point-of-view of 'Batman' (Ben Affleck) and all he is seeing is the carnage left in Superman's wake. On the other hand, 'Superman' (Henry Cavill) has become aware of the actions of Batman and he doesn't like what he considers him to be--a dark and sinister vigilante operating outside the boundaries of the legal system. Meanwhile, a psychotic genius named 'Lex Luthor' (Jesse Eisenberg) has his own plan to kill Superman and it involves manipulating Batman to do the job for him. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that comic book fans who enjoy action-packed films will probably like this movie. However, it is not without its faults. For starters, it had a number of different sub-plots which weren't allowed to develop due to the multitude of action scenes. Additionally, while the character of Batman thrives in a dark and gloomy setting, I don't believe that it suits Superman nearly as much and it remains to be seen whether the director (Zach Snyder) fully appreciates that. At least, that is my opinion. In any case, regardless of the flaws I liked this movie and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",6,0,3,1 April 2017
Tombstone," Not Historically Accurate but Enjoyable All the Same
","This movie begins with an outlaw gang known as 'the Cowboys' riding into a Mexican village where a wedding is being conducted. After killing several police officers attending the wedding, the outlaws then rape the new bride and subsequently murder the local priest in the process. The scene then shifts to Tucson where 'Wyatt Earp' (Kurt Russell) meets up with his brothers 'Virgil' (Sam Elliott) and 'Morgan' (Bill Paxton) en route to Tombstone. As luck would have it, upon arriving they meet up with 'Doc Holliday' (Val Kilmer) who intervenes in the nick of time to prevent them from being ambushed by a man Wyatt had completely humiliated just an hour before. Unknown to them, their fortunes are about to change when the Cowboys decide to ride in and take ownership of Tombstone. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an entertaining film from start to finish. I especially liked the acting of Val Kilmer and Dana Delaney who brightened each scene they were in. On the flip side, however, I didn't quite care for the manner in which Wyatt Earp was characterized as historically he was just as much of a scoundrel as any of the other people depicted in this film. So to have him in the role of as one of 'the good guys' seems a bit of a stretch. But that's Hollywood for you. Regardless, as stated earlier, I enjoyed this movie and because of that I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",7,1,1,23 August 2017
Bull Durham," A Film About Sex, Life and Baseball--But Not Necessarily in That Order
","'Ebby Calvin LaLoosh' (Tim Robbins) is a promising young baseball pitcher for the Durham Bulls of the Carolina League who has an awesome fastball but suffers from a severe lack of control. As a result a veteran catcher named 'Crash Davis' (Kevin Costner) is sent down to the Carolina League to somehow develop him into a first-class, major league pitcher. Along with that the Bull's biggest fan, 'Annie Savoy' (Susan Sarandon) takes Ebbie into her home to teach him about sex, life and baseball--but not necessarily in that order. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a pretty good comedy which benefited from the baseball background to a large extent. I especially liked the performance of Susan Sarandon who was both funny and sexy at the same time. Likewise, both Kevin Costner and Tim Robbins also performed rather well. In short, I thought that this was a pretty good movie and I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",7,1,1,17 September 2017
Signs," Had a Good Balance of Humor, Mystery and Suspense
","Six months after a fatal accident involving his wife 'Reverend Graham Hess' (Mel Gibson) has lost his faith and given up his calling to become a farmer instead. His son 'Morgan' (Rory Culkin) is asthmatic and his daughter 'Bo' (Abigail Breslin) is convinced that there is something wrong with every glass of water offered to her. Additionally, Graham's younger brother 'Merrill' (Joaquin Phoenix) who lives with them is somewhat backward. So when their cornfield has certain symbols cut into it they all come to bizarre conclusions on what it all means. Little do they realize at the time that their worst nightmare is about to come true. At any rate rather than divulge any more of the story and risk ruining this film for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this movie had a good balance of humor, mystery and suspense which managed to keep my interest from start to finish. Likewise while Mel Gibson performed well enough I especially liked the performance of Abigail Bresline and to a lesser extent that of Joaquin Phoenix as both were quite funny. In any case I liked this movie and rate it as slightly above average.",6,2,3,3 January 2015
Identity," An Imaginative Mystery Film
","This is an imaginative mystery film. Set during a storm, 10 different characters take refuge in a motel in the middle of nowhere. One by one they become victims of a psychotic killer whose identity is not disclosed until the very end. Because it keeps the audience guessing it manages to keep up the suspense and utilizes the dark, stormy environment to achieve an exciting climax. Good performances are accomplished by John Cusack ('Ed'), Ray Liotta ('Rhodes') and Amanda Peet ('Paris'). But I think the best acting was done by John Hawkes as the motel desk clerk, 'Larry'. And while it has no major faults, I would have preferred to see more of Rebecca De Mornay who played the self-centered actress named 'Caroline Suzanne'. But that's just my personal preference and it doesn't impair the movie to any real degree. In short, this is a very nice film that retains interest from start to finish. Highly recommended for those who enjoy a movie of this genre.",7,2,2,2 December 2012
X2: X-Men United," A Decent Sequel to the Original X-Men Movie
","When the President of the United States is attacked by a mutant who goes by the name of the 'Nightcrawler' (Alan Cumming) the decision is made to turn the matter over to a man named 'William Stryker' (Brian Cox) who assures the president that his intentions are honorable. Not long afterward however, Stryker uses his new-found authority to torture 'Magneto' (Ian McKellan), who is still imprisoned in his plastic prison cell, in order to gather enough information to launch an attack upon the school founded by 'Professor Charles Xavier' (Patrick Stewart). Now, rather than disclose Stryker's ultimate agenda and risk spoiling the film for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this was a decent sequel to the original 'X-Men' movie. I liked the acting of Alan Cumming and I certainly didn't mind the presence of Halle Berry (as 'Storm'), Famke Janssen ('Jean Grey') or Kelly Hu ('Lady Deathstrike'). However, I didn't care for the ending or the fact that there were probably too many characters and not enough film to cover them all. On the whole then I rate this movie as slightly above average.",6,0,0,17 January 2014
Thor: The Dark World," Plenty of Action and Humor Throughout
","Before the reign of 'Odin' (Anthony Hopkins) the Dark Elves were led by a malicious being known as 'Malekith' (Christopher Eccleston) who craved an extremely powerful energy source known as the 'Aether'. In his attempt to get it (in order to destroy the universe) war broke out between the Dark Elves and Aasgard which ended up in the Dark Elves being annihilated and the Aether buried forever. Or so everybody thought. As it so happens Malekith managed to escape and due to a rare convergence of the realms the Aether has become uncovered. And Malekith wants it badly. The only problem is that 'Jane Foster' (Natalie Portman) has not only discovered it but it has also infected her very soul. Recognizing Jane's serious plight Thor takes her to Aasgard for medical care. So in order for Malekith to acquire the Aether he now has to battle all of Aasgard in the process. Anyway, rather than detail the entire story and risk spoiling the picture for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this was a very good movie which had plenty of action and humor throughout. In all honesty though I thought there were some parts which seemed to drag a bit while other parts went overboard with the graphic action. In any case, this was quite enjoyable and I rate it as above average.",7,0,1,16 March 2014
Lucy," A Touch Too Much
","Coerced by someone she thought was her friend, 'Lucy' (Scarlet Johansson) is taken prisoner by a Korean drug lord named 'Mr. Jang' (Min-sik Choi) and forced to become a drug mule for him. To that end, a packet of a new drug called CPH4 is surgically inserted into her abdomen and she is told that she must take it from Taipei it to a city in Europe. However, prior to leaving she is treated rather harshly by one of her captors which results in the bag breaking open and releasing a large quantity of the new drug into her system. This causes her to have increased mental powers which continue to rise to an alarming degree. And using the new powers that she comes upon she also gains revenge on those who put her in this predicament. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this started off rather well but began to get out-of-control towards the end. It was all a touch too much. Perhaps if the director (Luc Besson) had kept things moving at a slower pace then it's possible this film could have really been something special. Unfortunately, he kept upping the ante to the point that it bordered on the ridiculous. Again, while this wasn't a bad film necessarily it could have been much better and I have rated it accordingly. Average.",5,0,2,1 March 2017
RED," Retired and Extremely Dangerous
","'Frank Moses' (Bruce Willis) is a former CIA agent who specialized in 'wet work'. And he was very good at his job. But he is now retired and has developed a crush on a person named 'Sarah Ross' (Mary-Louise Parker) who he has never met but helps him with his retirement check over the phone. One day a team of assassins are sent to kill him at his home and after killing all of them he realizes that his phone records might jeopardize Sarah. So he drives to Kansas City and kidnaps her. Along with that he gradually gets in contact with several other people he has worked with in the past to help him out. Naturally, all of them are just like him: Retired and Extremely Dangerous. Anyway, for an action-comedy this film turned out to be pretty good. Both Bruce Willis and Mary-Louise Parker turned in decent performances but it John Malkovich (as 'Marvin Boggs') who really stole the show as the paranoid agent who was subjected to LSD for 11 years. He was simply hilarious. That said, I liked this movie and I recommend it for those who enjoy films of this nature.",7,0,0,10 October 2013
Kagemusha," A Magnificent Film
","This movie takes its place in feudal Japan during the 16th century in which certain warlords are fighting amongst themselves to attain total supremacy. As luck would have it, a thief by the name of 'Kagemusha' (Tatsuya Nakadai) just happens to bear an alarming resemblance to one of these warlords named 'Shingen Takeda' (also Tatsuya Nakadai) and this strange coincidence is immediately seized upon by Shingen for its practical applications. In essence, this gives Shingen a perfect double in which to confuse his enemies. At least, that was his original intent. Unfortunately, Shingen is shot not long afterward and rather than allow his kingdom to totally collapse he convinces his brother keep his impending death a secret for 3 years to give his generals some time to adjust to the situation. This means employing Kagemusha to his fullest extent. And even then it might not be enough. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a magnificent film which incorporated stunning visual effects to achieve an incredible film experience. An excellent movie.",9,1,1,20 December 2015

Upon awakening she then proceeds to school and tells three of her friends about it. To her horror she finds that they too are having similar nightmares. Not knowing what else to do they gather at Tina's house that night while her mother is in Las Vegas and suddenly Tina's dream comes alive as she is sliced to death in bed while her horrified boyfriend 'Rod Lane' (Jsu Garcia) looks on. Naturally, since there was nobody else seen in the room at the time Rod is arrested and charged for Tina's murder. However, while in his cell he too becomes a victim of the same disfigured man with razor blades for fingers-and the killer is just getting started. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this movie pretty much earned its place among other established slasher films of the time like 'Halloween' and 'Friday the 13th' garnering $57 million dollars worldwide and competing quite successfully with those aforementioned franchises as well. In short, those who are looking for a good 80's slasher film should certainly be pleased with this particular picture and I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",7,2,2,28 April 2020

Anyway, rather than reveal any more of the plot and risk spoiling the film for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this was a pretty good science-fiction movie that incorporates good special effects and lots of action. Or perhaps its more accurate to say that this is a good action film that relies upon science-fiction and special effects. Either way it's a pretty good film and the only reason I didn't rate it higher was that I thought some of the dialogue was a bit weak and the action went a bit overboard. All things considered then I rate this movie as above average and I recommend it to those who enjoy science-fiction and action movies all rolled into one.",7,1,2,27 December 2013

","After his father is killed in the service of his country, 'Eggsy' (Taron Egerton) lives with his mother and her low-class boyfriend with little opportunity for upward mobility. However, he still holds onto a locket given to him as a young boy with an advisement to call an inscribed number if he ever needs serious help. So one day after fighting off some local bullies and being subsequently arrested for stealing the gang member's car he makes the call. To his surprise he is immediately released and the charges are all dropped. It's then that he learns that his father was a member of a clandestine organization in the British government known as the 'Kingsman' and he is encouraged to join. However, it isn't nearly as easy to graduate from the program as he would like and he watches as the other people selected begin to drop out one by one. Meanwhile, a crazed billionaire by the name of 'Richmond Valentine' (Samuel L. Jackson) who has come up with a plan to save the world from greenhouse gasses by killing almost all of the people who inhabit it. And with very few agents available to investigate Eggsy is called upon to help out before everything and everyone is killed. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an interesting movie which raced from one exciting scene to the next in a very smooth manner. Unfortunately, the director (Matthew Vaughn) chose to take the low-road and utilized an over-abundance of vulgarity for the sake of some cheap laughs much too often. And most of it was simply unnecessary. In any event, this grew rather tiring after awhile and seriously limited the movie's overall appeal. But even so it was still entertaining to a certain degree and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",6,1,2,9 March 2017
Easy A," The Problem with Telling Lies
","Although 'Rhiannon' (Aly Michalka) is her best friend, a high school student by the name of 'Olive' (Emma Stone) cannot stand the thought of going with her on a camping trip with Rhiannon's parents. So unable to think of any other excuse, Olive concocts a story about having a date with a college guy for that very weekend. Naturally, being a close friend, when Rhiannon returns she demands that Olive tell her everything about her date. This leads Olive to invent yet another story about losing her virginity in order to make it seem more appealing. This then creates a new problem as their conversation is overheard in the female restroom by a sanctimonious gossip named 'Marianne' (Amanda Bynes) who then proceeds to tell everybody in the school. As a result, Olive quickly gets a reputation for being a promiscuous tramp which subsequently intrigues all of the guys-but infuriates all of the girls. Naturally, hormones being what they are, things take on a life of their own from that point on. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a cute comedy which started off reasonably well but then slowed down a bit before the end. Even so, I thought Emma Stone put in a pretty good performance overall and for that reason I have rated this film accordingly. Slightly above average.",6,0,0,21 August 2019
Fast Five," Heading Down to Rio de Janeiro
","This film takes up where its predecessor ('Fast & Furious') left off with 'Dominic Toretto' (Vin Diesel) being hauled away in a bus on his way to prison. However, before Dominic can be transported to his destination his sister, 'Mia Toretto' (Jordana Brewster) and the former undercover agent named 'Brian O'Connor' (Paul Walker) intercept the bus and rescue him. Knowing that they cannot remain in the United States any longer the three of them head down to Rio de Janeiro and resume their usual operations there. Not long after arriving they team up with an extremely corrupt politician named 'Reyes' (Joaquim de Almeida) who then attempts to double-cross them. Fortunately, Dominic is prepared for this and skillfully manages to turn the tables on Reyes by escaping in a special car which has a valuable computer chip that details Reyes' entire operation. Needless to say, Reyes wants that chip back at all costs and immediately sends his men to capture Dominic and his crew so that he can interrogate and subsequently kill them once he has it. What nobody realizes is that a special agent has been sent from the United States named 'Luke Hobbs' (Dwayne Johnson) who also has orders to capture Dominic and Brian as well. To that end, neither Reyes nor Luke Hobbs are easily deterred. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that--while this was definitely an entertaining action film--it suffered from one major flaw in that it had too many high-speed stunts which were simply too ridiculous and improbable to be believed. It was just too much. Be that as it may, I liked the addition of Dwayne Johnson who definitely added something extra to the film. Likewise, having three attractive actresses like Gal Gadot (as 'Gisele'), Elsa Pataky ('Elena') and the aforementioned Jordana Brewster certainly didn't hurt either. That being said, even though this movie would have been much better if the director (Justin Lin) hadn't gotten so carried away with everything, it was still an okay sequel and I have rated it accordingly.

John Wick: Chapter 2," Almost as Good as Its Predecessor
","This film essentially begins where its predecessor ended with the Russian assassin 'John Wick' (Keanu Reeves) in the process of locating his stolen Ford Mustang which has been transported to a local garage for resell. As it so happens, the owner of this illegal garage is the brother of the crime lord who John killed in the first film. Not realizing the intense sentimental value John has for this car 'Abram Tarasov' (Peter Stormare) decides to defend his territory rather than simply giving John his car back. Sure enough, John kills everyone who gets in his way and soon enters Abram's office. To Abram's surprise, rather than just killing him then and there, John offers peace. Naturally, Abram accepts immediately and breathes a sigh of relief as John takes his damaged car and leaves. Unfortunately for John, he soon finds out that he cannot retire and live in peace as another crime lord named 'Santino D'Antonio' (Riccardo Scamarcio) comes to his house and demands that he honor a marker which John previously swore to uphold whenever it was presented. When John refuses Santino has his house destroyed along with several other valuable keepsakes that John treasured. With no other place to stay John goes to the Continental Hotel and once there the owner named 'Winston' (Ian McShane) reminds John that he cannot turn down Santino's marker. Although he is extremely reluctant, John finally decides to accept the marker and fulfill the job Santino demands of him. However, as Winston later tells Santino, the decision to force John back into the world he truly wants to quit is going to have severe consequences for everyone involved. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a fine sequel which managed to combine an interesting plot with a great amount of action. Having said that, even though I thoroughly enjoyed this film, I don't believe it was quite as good as the first movie. Almost-but not quite. Another thing I would like to mention is that while this film certainly set the stage for another installment, I fear that--like so many movies made during this current time--the third film might degenerate into mindless action completely lacking any realism or imagination whatsoever. I suppose time will tell. In any case, I thought this was a pretty good movie and I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",7,2,6,20 April 2017

","With political intrigue in the home office and an independent expedition which has him grounded, 'James Bond' (Daniel Craig) has to disobey orders and proceed on his own investigation regarding a man nick-named the 'Pale King' (Jesper Christensen) who might hold some answers to an extremely sinister plot from an equally malicious organization known as 'Spectre'. This investigation soon takes him from London to various destinations including Mexico City, Tunisia and Austria during which each give him clues that eventually bring him back to London again. Now rather than reveal any more and risk spoiling the movie for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this was one of the better James Bond films ever produced with modern special effects and Daniel Craig's personality complementing the plot almost perfectly. Unfortunately, the vague mission at the beginning and the somewhat predictable ending could have used some improvement. Likewise, I'm not really sure if this movie is a 'reboot' which changes the entire James Bond scenario or a prequel which somehow ties them all back together again with the first James Bond film ('Dr. No'). I suppose time will tell. In any case, I enjoyed this film and I have rated it accordingly.",8,0,3,14 July 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," Extremely Inflated
","Like the previous 'Mad Max' movies this film takes place in a future desert world which has been devastated by a nuclear war. What remains of humanity is both primitive and barbaric and those who have survived exist with the most basic of necessities in war-like fortresses where few laws exist. That being the case, after being taken as a prisoner, it is to one of these harsh enclaves that 'Max' (Tom Hardy) is subsequently forced to endure. And since life has very little value Max ends up as nothing more than a human blood bank for one of the militaristic 'War Boys' by the name of 'Nux' (Nicholas Hoult). It's at this same time that one of the military leaders named 'Imperator Furiosa' (Charlize Theron) decides to escape from this citadel and she takes with her five wives of the religious leader, 'Immortan Joe' (Hugh Keays-Byrne). Soon all of the clans in the entire area are summoned to assist in the recapture of Imperator Furiosa with both Nux and his captive Max in hot pursuit and leading the charge. Now rather than reveal any more of this movie I will just say that those who enjoy films which feature action from start to finish will really appreciate this picture. However, it is this strength which also happens to be the films weakness as there is very little room for anything else. That said, I thought the talents of both Tom Hardy--and in particular Charlize Theron--were terribly wasted. Likewise, I also believe that the current IMDb score of 8.4 (whether by chance or design) is extremely inflated as well. To that end, I would hope that once the initial euphoria has subsided realism will set in and the score will more closely resemble the film's actual merits. Time will tell. In any case, while I certainly do not believe that this particular film is deserving of scores equal to classics like 'Gone with the Wind', I also don't consider this to be a bad movie either. Accordingly, while my score may not be popular at this time I have rated this movie as I see it. Average.",5,10,20,7 August 2015
Hacksaw Ridge," Non-Violence in the Heat of Battle
","Due to his upbringing as a Seventh Day Adventist, 'Desmond Doss' (Andrew Garfield) does not believe in killing his fellow man-even in war. However, after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the subsequent enlistment of every able bodied person that he knows, Desmond enlists in the Army as a combat medic. Yet, even though he is told he would not have to shoulder a rifle, Desmond discovers that his entire chain-of-command requires him to do so anyway. This results in an incredible strain on him when he decides to follow his religious convictions but refuses to accept any kind of discharge which might be prejudicial to him or his religious beliefs. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film featured intense action in addition to some decent human drama. On the minus side, I thought that the combat scenes went on a bit too long and the computer graphics utilized were somewhat obvious. Likewise the interviews at the end were a bit redundant as well. But all things considered I thought that this was a good movie and I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",7,0,1,15 September 2017
The Bourne Supremacy," An Interesting Continuation
","This film essentially begins where its predecessor ('The Bourne Identity') left off with former CIA agent 'Jason Bourne' (Matt Damon) still suffering from amnesia but managing to hide out in India with his German girlfriend 'Marie' (Franka Potente). It's at the same time, however, that a clandestine meeting in Berlin ends in two murders and the immediate suspect for these killings is none other than: Jason Bourne. Not long afterward an attempt is made on Jason Bourne's life which results in tragic consequences all around. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an interesting continuation which had plenty of action and mystery to keeps things enjoyable. Unfortunately, there really wasn't much of anything new or original that hadn't already been addressed in the first movie so apparently to fill in some time the viewer is treated to extended car chase scenes that seem to go on forever. Additionally, the change of location from Berlin to Moscow seemed a bit too abrupt and could have been better handled. At least, that is my opinion. In any case, there was still several good aspects of this movie and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",6,0,3,29 September 2016
Warm Bodies," Funny and Cute
","Let me just say that I typically don't like 'zom-coms' for the simple reason that most of them just aren't that funny. Additionally, the idea of a romance between a person and a zombie fills me with revulsion. Having said that, I fully expected to be bored to tears or completely disgusted with this particular film. I was pleasantly surprised. Essentially, 'R' (Nicholas Hoult) is a zombie who ambles along--day in and day out-doing what zombies typically do. Then one day he and a number of other zombies stumble upon a group of humans and while he is chowing down on one happens to see a beautiful woman named 'Julie' (Teresa Palmer) who is surrounded and totally vulnerable. This strikes a strange impulse in his brain to protect her and lead her to a safe location. What follows is a story that is both funny and cute without getting too morbid or syrupy. Be that as it may, judging from some of the other reviews my opinion is not shared by everybody. To each his own. In any case, I didn't think this film was too bad and I rate it as slightly above average.",6,1,3,29 October 2013
All the President's Men," An Abuse of Power
","After a failed burglary attempt within the Democratic National Committee results in the apprehension of several men carrying sophisticated electronic gear, a pair of reporters from the Washington Post by the names of 'Carl Bernstein' (Dustin Hoffman) and 'Bob Woodward' (Robert Redford) are assigned to report on the case. But as they uncover one clue after another they soon realize that this is no ordinary burglary. What they don't realize at the time, however, is the impact their reporting will bring to bear on the American political process and the important bearing it will have for the First Amendment and a free press. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an extremely interesting film which not only benefits from good performances by both Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman but also highlights the dark nature of the American political system in an excellent manner as well. Definitely above average.",8,0,0,28 September 2018
Draft Day," An Exciting Film which Keeps the Tension Going from Start to Finish
","This film begins with the general manager for the Cleveland Browns by the name of 'Sonny Weaver Jr.' (Kevin Costner) being told by his girlfriend 'Ali' (Jennifer Garner) that she is pregnant. It is then learned that the Cleveland Browns have the seventh draft pick and that Sonny's secret plan is to select a linebacker by the name 'Volante Mack' (Chadwick Boseman) at that time. However, the owner of the Cleveland Browns, 'Anthony Miller' (Frank Langella) essentially tells Sonny that he expects him to excel in this year's draft which subsequently puts pressure on Sonny to do something dramatic-or else. As a result, Sonny accepts an offer from the Seattle Seahawks to acquire the number 1 pick overall for Cleveland's first three draft choices next year. This infuriates a number of people in his front office who believe that he has traded away the Cleveland Brown's future for a quarterback that they didn't necessarily need. To make matters even worse, Sonny secretly believes this as well and becomes determined to fix the problem one way or another. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that those viewers who are unfamiliar with the intricacies and pressure of an NFL draft may not quite appreciate the high stakes tension that goes into this particular situation. Fortunately, Kevin Costner puts in an excellent performance and maintains the tension start-to-finish. In addition to that, there is an interesting twist at the end which ties many of the loose ends together quite well. In any case, I really enjoyed this film and because of that I have rated it accordingly.",8,0,0,26 September 2019
The Wizard of Oz," A Pure Delight
","This movie is a pure delight. I remember back when I was young that it would come on television once a year and whenever it played it was like watching it for the very first time. It was both wonderful and magical. Even today it is a joy to watch and having seen it at least fifteen times that in and of itself is quite remarkable. At least for me. Be that as it may, I think it is important to inform new viewers that this movie was made back in 1939 and as a result it doesn't have the computer graphics or any of the technology used today to enhance the special effects. But what special effects it does have is still pretty good even by today's standards. Add in the music and performances of Judy Garland (as 'Dorothy'), Ray Bolger (the 'Scarecrow'), Bert Lahr (the 'Cowardly Lion'), and Jack Haley (the 'Tin Man') and the end result is something that I don't believe can ever be duplicated. In short, not only is this movie a 'classic' in every sense of the word but I believe it ranks in the top 3 films of all time. If you've never seen this movie then by all means you need to buy or rent it as soon as possible. You'll be glad you did.",10,6,7,29 August 2014
The Martian," Out of this World!
","Having successfully landed on Mars the crew of the Ares III encounter a terrific storm which separates one of the astronauts named 'Mark Watney' (Matt Damon) from the rest. Considering him to be dead and in order to escape the storm the Ares III launches without him. Once he regains consciousness he realizes his plight and decides to try to stay alive as long as he can. But with no communication and limited supplies he knows that the odds are steeped very much against him. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that although it was rather predictable and cheesy it was still quite entertaining. Matt Daman, as usual, performed in an excellent manner and coupled with the beautiful 'Martian' scenery along with the tension the director (Ridley Scott) managed to maintain even though the film was well over 2 hours kept the film from becoming either dull or boring. In any case, I enjoyed this movie and I have rated it accordingly. Definitely above average.",8,4,6,3 February 2016
Law Abiding Citizen," A Miscarriage of Justice
","After being forced to watch as his wife and young daughter are visciously killed in front of him, 'Clyde Shelton' (Gerard Butler) is somewhat assured of justice when he learns that both of the criminals have been apprehended and are awaiting trial. Unfortunately, Clyde's faith in the justice system is shattered when he is told the prosecutor assigned to this case named 'Nick Rice' (Jamie Foxx) has made a plea deal which will allow the main culprit to avoid the death penalty and eventually gain his release from prison. Extremely upset with this decision Clyde becomes determined to punish both of the thugs who killed his family-and everybody associated with this miscarriage of justice as well. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this movie started off rather well but became more and more unrealistic as it further developed. Even so, it kept my attention for the most part and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",6,0,0,6 September 2018
Furious 7," One Preposterous Stunt After Another
","With his brother in a comatose condition in the hospital, 'Deckard Shaw' (Jason Statham) swears vengeance on 'Dominic Toretto' (Vin Diesel) and his team who put him there. Now, while this should certainly be a possible cause for concern to any normal person, the fact of the matter is that Deckard is a highly trained and extremely skilled professional assassin who has a terrorist organization at his disposal to help him out. Fortunately, Dominic also has some resources of his own with 'Luke Hobbs' (Dwayne Johnson) and a shadowy government official who calls himself 'Mr. Nobody' (Kurt Russell) who have separate agendas which coincide with Dominic's plans to kill Deckard before he can kill them. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this picture definitely had the talent to be a very fine film. Unfortunately, the director (James Wan) resorted to one preposterous stunt after another which made this film look rather ridiculous in my opinion. Having said that, those who are fans of this particular franchise will probably love this movie for the simple fact that it has plenty of action and some of their favorite actors. Unfortunately, the complete lack of realism severely damaged its credibility in my eyes and I have rated it accordingly. Below average.",3,9,13,29 April 2017
The Godfather," An Excellent Movie
","Based on the best-selling novel by the same name, this film begins in 1945 at a large party hosted by the head of the most powerful organized crime family in the United States 'Don Vito Corleone' (Marlon Brando) to celebrate the marriage of his only daughter 'Connie Corleone' (Talia Shire). As per Sicilian custom, several people have arrived to ask him a personal favor knowing that he cannot refuse during this particular event. It's also during this time that his youngest son 'Michael Corleone' (Al Pacino) arrives having taken time off from his duties in the Marine Corps to attend. Unlike his older brothers 'Sonny Corleone' (James Caan), 'Fredo Corleone' (John Cazale) and his adopted brother 'Tom Hagen' (Robert Duvall), Michael wants no part of the family business and Vito is respectful of that decision. Unfortunately, things don't go quite as planned and-like it or not-Michael is soon thrust into the situation due to matters outside of his control. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an outstanding film which combined great acting with a very deep and intricate plot. And to further illustrate its significance it was honored the following year with three Academy Awards and five Golden Globe Awards as well. In short, this is an excellent movie I strongly recommend it to all viewers looking for a film of this sort.",10,1,1,9 March 2020
