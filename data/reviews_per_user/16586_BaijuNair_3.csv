Skyfall," Skyfall...probably the best Bond movie ever...!!
","After watching Daniel Craig in 'Casino Royale' and 'Quantum of Solace' I used to frequently think he is so apt conceiving the image of Bond as a no nonsense yet captivating guy..now after watching 'Skyfall' i am pretty sure that he is one of the best to portray Bond even in the league of Sean Connery I would say..Now if you are a great fan of the 'Bond gadgets' you would be a touch disappointed with Skyfall, just because there is nothing much of it..also the length of the movie is about 2.5 hours which is not normal for a James Bond movie. But all these 'faults' (if you would call them) gives away to the extremely well crafted movie that is 'Skyfall'. The script is a winner all the way along with the performance of the lead actors. Craig is just superb as Bond with is now-famous rugged looks and the dialog delivery and as always he excels in the action sequences which are choreographed superbly. When you say about performance you would not want to miss to mention about Javier Bardem who plays the Villain in the film and that of Judi Dench as 'M'. Bardem stands equal to Craig and is undoubtedly one of the best villains in the Bond movies. Judi Dench has an extended role in this compared to the previous ones and she does a fantastic job with it.Bond girls were a let down though I have to say...Naomie Harris doesn't have any chemistry with Craig and is a let down with regard to her performance. It was fascinating to see the script focusing about Bond's childhood and showcasing the affection and respect Bond and 'M' has towards each other.Even though I felt the climax a bit dragging it was not at all a flaw considering the whole package was just awesome..",8,3,12,11 November 2012
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," 'MISSION IMPOSSIBLE - ROGUE NATION' entertains well
","Tom Cruise and his mission is back...and how! Went to see the latest installment of the MI series 'Rogue Nation' and Tom Cruise shows time and again why he is a global superstar and one of the best ever action stars from Hollywood.Coming back to the movie, it somewhat starts from where the last MI movie 'Ghost Protocol' ended. After successfully tackling a gas transfer to terrorists from a cargo plane Hunt is sure about the existence of the 'Syndicate' the top crime organization. While he goes to the designated secret area to get the details of his mission he is tricked by the 'syndicate' inside a gas chamber'. He sees the leader through the glass door before he losses consciousness.Meanwhile, the CIA is hellbent to prove the top senate that IMF (of which Ethan Hunt (Cruise), Brandt (Jeremy Renner), Benji (Simon Pegg) and Luther are part of) is a dangerous organization to the interests of USA and calls strongly to dissolve IMF and get the members of the IMF to join CIA, to which the senate agrees. Hunr escapes from the captivity with the help of a lady (not disclosing her full details here). Now Hunt is on the run targeted by both Syndicate as well as CIA. How Hunt gets back with his team, connects the dots to find the Syndicate guy, destroys his plans and prove IMF's worth in front of the senate forms the rest of the film.As for performance, Tom Cruise steals the show with his charisma and action as Ethan Hunt. He keeps the viewers at the edge of their seat with his action sequences. Right from the start with the 'Hanging outside the plane while it takes off', 'the BMW car chase scene', the 'Bike chase scene' and the 'Underwater chamber scene' Cruise excels in whatever he does in the movie. And at 53 one should admire for the work he has done for this movie. Simon Pegg is brilliant as Benji and his combo scenes with Cruise are really funny which sends the audience bursting into laughter. The rest of the crew also plays their roles pretty well.Overall its a very entertaining movie with lot of thrills and spills. If you are a fan of MI franchise or Cruise you will definitely like this one.",8,0,2,8 August 2015
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," A one time watch...
",Went over to see The Amazing Spider-Man 2 with my 4 year old daughter last weekend. To be honest the film is a bit of a let down with a lot of unwanted characters. There is nothing special in the movie which will make you think about watching it for a 2nd time. The chemistry between Andrew Garfiled and Emma Stone is the highlight of the movie. And obviously there is the usual thrills and spills one would associate with a Spiderman movie. Action sequences I felt was a bit overboard sometimes..Kids will love it for sure not so much with adults I would assume. Although I must confess that I am much more of a Tobey Maguire Spiderman fan than the one portrayed by Andrew Garfield.,7,2,6,5 May 2014
