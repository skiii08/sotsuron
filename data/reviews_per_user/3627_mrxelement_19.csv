Iron Man 3," Iron What??
","I have always thought the Iron Man movies were horrible to me. The 3rd one so far is at least better then the last two movies combined. Of course, Robert Downey Dr. delivers a good performance ,but feels flat since its already getting old. Also his anxiety attacks should have been left out of the movie since that was pointless. **SPOILERS!!** On other note, the twist to this movie was a complete joke. You're gonna grab your hair and say ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!. He was a damn actor the whole time. So many hearts broken over this, I wanted to laugh how pathetic they tricked us into believing we have a villain who was menacing enough to destroy Tony Stark. Yet, we get theses weird lava people who are not even interesting at all.Unfortunately, Iron Man 3 didn't even feel like a Iron Man at all? Tony Stark himself wasn't even Iron Man the whole fricking movie. Simply controlling the prototypes like a toy. I wanted him to kick-ass ,but that failed too since he is always getting his ass beat unlike, in The Avengers where he totally kick major ass in that one. Why couldn't he do in this one!! It angers me in every Iron Man movie. All in all, save your money!! The actions scenes are not even worth watching, Tony Stark gets old already, and a huge fail on the twist. Watch the trailer instead of watching this crap.",4,3,6,8 May 2013
This Is the End," Worth Every Single Cent!!
","Wow... I am completely shocked of how unbelievable 'This Is the End' had me laughing from all the awesome scenes from start to finish!!Theses guys are straight up amazing even when it comes to d--k jokes to see who's gonna eat the last Milky-way bar, it all works out for them!I love how everybody plays as themselves making fun of each other and criticizing from what movies they did.It makes this movie comedy gold!!Pretty impressive how the Micheal Cera ended up being my favorite scene from the whole movie. Also the other cameos are quite nice!!Watch this movie with a group with friends and you will end up dying from laughter!!",8,4,18,16 June 2013
World War Z," PG-13 Zombies?? No Thanks!
","Brad Pitt in a world full of zombies very awesome? Yeah... I don't think so. Seeing the early trailers for World War Z,I knew it was gonna be a cheap flick. The zombies were beyond stupid... climbing like ants! Are you kidding me? All those CGI zombies look like complete garbage nor they didn't even look threatening. All they do is scream like idiots. I want zombies to look scary as hell with their limbs open and blood coming out of there mouth. NO!! we get stupid PG-13 version of it because of 'money' since its gonna target teenagers mostly that are probably gonna say 'VERY GOOD FILM 10/10.' Now the action was quite boring including the dumb plot- line that wasn't interesting at all. Bored me silly! I've become a zombie myself for watching this piece of garbage. World War Z is a 0 for me.",4,25,47,7 July 2013
Shaun of the Dead," Shaun is Brilliant
","A movie that brings perfect comedy into the zombie world brings topnotch perfection from outstanding perfection as Simon Pegg and Nick Frost take the screen. Shaun and his trusty bestfriend Nick are without a doubt the best duos on film on screen. I loved this movie with all my heart because its a classic,I can watch every single day that it will never get old. Drinking beers, killing zombies, and watching TV is a good way to go. Even the other cast members were pretty good. I was surprise of how violent this movie was. Their was blood gushing out, zombies with intestines hanging in place, and a whole lot of biting! Every zombie lover in the world has to love Shaun of the Dead for its brilliance. I don't think their will ever be a movie like this anymore but that's okay cause this movie is gold.",10,1,3,11 August 2013
Argo," Argo the Terrible
","Argo.. Argo... I heard this movie everywhere! On the radio,news,websites, and reviews saying Argo is one action pack that delivers the tension greatly that it fully deserves Oscar. People praise this movie as being the best they seen. It was overrated and terribly hype with Ben Affeck's wooden acting. Seriously, he was like a stick during the whole movie, it seem like he just didn't care at all. Only John Goodman and Alan Arkin including Bryan Cranston had good roles. What's really disappointing that Alan Arkin only appeared in the Argo for like fifteen minutes and already he deserves a supporting actor in a role? That simply doesn't make sense. All the other actors suck and bought nothing to the table. I seriously wanted to turn off the movie also because this Argo is terribly boring! No action, no suspense, no nothing. Didn't even feel like a Oscar worthy movie either. Don't waste your time on this movie.",4,3,4,27 April 2013
Don Jon," Leaves You Wondering...
","Joseph Gordon-Levitt first debut film was outstanding and I have to say it quite shows he has talent for film- making. Although, their are a lot of several scenes that have been repeated throughout the movie making it feel like you keep watching the same thing all over again. Yet, it manages to keep the story interesting with Jon how he is facing his problem with his porn addiction and having to face girl problems. The editing is pretty well done capturing real porn clips into the movie which was bizarre cause I have never seen that before on the big screen. And trust me there are a lot of little porn clips in the movie. Still,every guy should watch this movie because it surely does have facts to it about men,women, and sex. Joseph Gordon plays a good job being this guy who gets all the chicks. Scarlet Johansson one incredibly fine looking actress like wow she is stunning. Tony Danza did pretty good. I just find having Julianne Moore in this movie kinda weird but it works at least. And everybody else was okay and did their part.8.3/10",8,9,16,5 October 2013
Fast & Furious 6," Pedal To The Metal!
","Hell yeah!! Now this is the movie to go see in theaters!! Hearing those loud car engines roaring,screaming, and rushing makes my ears tickle in excitement!! The cars are sexy and the Toretto family is still kicking in gear in a another action pack adrenaline rush manhunt.You think the movie will start off slow but, oh no it cuts right to the chase to not leave the viewer bored. Not only its filled with action ,but good humor as well. Especially, Roman who kept the audience filled with laughter mostly every scene he is in. I loved how The Rock simply kicks so much ass even when he is standing still giving orders. Very glad to see he is in the pack again. A great character to the franchise. Vin Diesel is still the same old Vin we all knew from the previous Fast and The Furious movies ,but pairs up with The Rock which makes it even better.Very good movie you wouldn't want to miss in theaters. Also extra ending at the end of the movie will blow you away!!",8,5,10,27 May 2013
Pacific Rim," Godzilla Eat Your Heart Out
","Pacific Rim has to be one of the best Robots vs Aliens movies I've seen in a long time! It reminded of the classic Power Rangers in how they form into their ultimate suit to beat the bad guys! Well, the aliens in Pacific Rim are colossal size as well for the robots! Seeing this movie in theaters is a must, especially in D-box because those fights scenes are so intense you feel the punches, the sound of the robots clanking and the aliens screaming is magnificent, the quality is superb even if your not Imax screen, you still get the same feeling. Pacific Rim is win for me! 8.5/10",8,1,6,14 July 2013
Oblivion," Decent Sci-Fi Film
","Oblivion is one of those movies where you be like 'Yeah, I've seen that before.' It's indeed a film to watch theaters watching Jack investigate the lonely wasteland all alone to fix theses drones out in the middle of nowhere with his partner(Victoria) who is on the lookout for any suspicious activities. The places that Jack visits in his trusty mini airplane are jaw-dropping from the mountains, sky, and down below can be pretty shocking how much as the earth as changed. Clearly, this movie has a fair amount of action which won't leave you bored. The story-line has been done before ,but it felt like it should have been told better. Overall, not one of the best but, a good time! 7.5/10",7,0,1,13 May 2013
Man of Steel," Could Have Been Better
","When I first saw the preview of Man of Steel I had my doubts. Sure the effects of the movie look amazing ,but at times the movie felt really choppy at places going from here to there jumping around the place. It also had no humor at all making the film dry with only serious talks not showing one simple smile to make the audience at least give us a laugh.Now as for the actor that plays Superman he did okay job yet, i felt like Superman gave no emotion expect yelling and looking at everybody with a straight face. Amy Adam played a good role which I simply enjoyed. The action is pretty cool in some sort of Dragon Ball Z way in how the fights were portrayed of having Superman and his enemies fight through buildings and delivering punches that make them fly like rag-dolls. Also seeing Superman using his heat vision is pretty badass.As for all, its watchable but a hit or miss. 6.7/10",7,4,7,17 July 2013
District 9," I Got Cat-food!
","For 28 years, a humongous air-craft has been idling above the sky of Johannesburg, South Africa carrying aliens that have been called 'Prawns'. The humans have been interacting for quite sometime that alien technology is quite advanced from the tech that's on earth. Especially, the armory the prawns bought down to earth. Here we have Wikus Van De Merwe, who works for those people who collect alien weapons and is force to move all the aliens into a concentration camp. As Wikus patrols the dirty streets of Africa, he found something worst that will change his life completely and make him something entirely new. This amazing movie has good direction,dialogue, and pace. It never once got boring and kept me on the edge!! Giving out spoilers will ruin this movie so its well worth watching!! One of my favorites movies of all time!!",10,2,3,31 May 2013
Django Unchained," The D is Silent HillBilly
","Quentin Tarantino is the man for creating such unique characters for being all in all BADASS! Dr. King Schultz already within the first 5 seconds is simply a god in this movie. The way Dr.Schultz talks flows incredibly smoothly having his English so rich and proper that's its extraordinary not to love this character. On the other hand, there's Django who transforms into a bounty hunter himself with the help of his loyal partner Dr. King Schultz. Django is at top of his game trying to get his wife back and he won't stop at nothing.Even the evil racist Calvin Candie (who is played by Leo DiCaprio) puts on a whole different show that's no one seen before. His acting his superb and you totally love the guy for being such a ***hole. Since this is a Quentin Tarantino movie of course their has to be a lot of violence, oh boy... their is plenty to go around! ***SPOILERS*** Their's this one scene where Django goes insane with his revolver cutting down Candie's men into bits. Its ridiculous how much blood shed is in this one scene. The whole entire room is filled with it. Once that 2pac song plays... nobody messes with Django. If you like western spaghetti movies and top notch writing with comedy in it. This is the movie for you. It makes you want to buy a revolver to become badass like Django. 9.5/10",9,1,3,20 April 2013
Drive," Give Me A Time and A Place
","Wow... I had no idea Drive would deliver a beautiful poem of love,violence, and death into a terrific movie. Seeing that pink neon lipstick light remind me of Vice City plus, having one kick-ass soundtrack you can't simply miss. Now don't get mixed up by the title Drive, it's not a racing movie nor your typical action blockbuster movie. The pacing of Drive is very slow ,but it builds towards a great,shocking, suspense thought-out wanting to know what will the Driver do next? Ryan Gosling performance was great being the chillest wheel-man keeping his cool out of danger wearing his white leather jacket automatically a bad-ass. It definitely goes on my top 10 movies of all time. Hopefully Only God Forgive can give the same feel Drive gave for me. 10/10",10,2,5,27 April 2013
Evil Dead," What A Bore Fest
","This is a simply a disgrace to the Evil Dead franchise, I can't believe I wasted my money actually thinking this movie would scare the hell of me because I thought it will have a chance to redeem itself. Nope, it all went down to completely boring.The characters were not even interesting even the stupid plot of Mia having a drug addiction was not even necessary to put in the movie. Besides, Evil Dead try way to hard being this gore-fest of movie. Of course that's what the movie try to be ,but I've seen better. They wanted to shock audience by throwing on people? Cutting their own body parts? Please... that's what they did mostly throughout the movie. Just cut themselves apart. WHERE WAS THE SCARY!! WHERE WAS THE CRAZY DEMONS MESSING WITH YOUR MIND!! WHERE WAS THE SCARY DEMON VOICE!! THE DEMONS WERE NOT SCARY AT ALL! Just people in eye-contacts and gray skin... -_- Don't waste your money on this filth save that money for something better. (SPOILER)!! OK sure the last 5mins of Mia cutting the abomination in half was cool with all the blood spraying. I'll have to wait and see if the NC-17 version is slightly better than this piece of crap.",1,60,116,17 April 2013
The Evil Dead," A Horror Classic That Is Simply Genius
","Finally, a movie that change the horror genre shocking the audience with intense gore using brutal violence that was to much ,but felt so right for the movie. All that blood that was spilled on the floor and wall makes me want to be for more! The acting in The Evil Dead is not the best ,but as for myself I didn't seem to have a problem with it. Let alone, theses poor teenagers are constantly suffering inside a cabin with no help or anything. The demons play around with them like puppets. Thank god Sam Raimi created the character Ash to bring down some hell!! It's really surprising how they got away showing this in theaters especially, the infamous scene in the woods that everybody remembers. As for the make up, how incredible the demons looked for a budget that was about $350,000. Blood coming out of their mouths, big white pearl eyes, with insane body decay, screaming and laughing... ahh I LOVE IT!!!Now theses are the demons that belong in Evil Dead!, the remake of Evil Dead seem to fail at that. Its a bloody good horror classic even though it has a cheesy moments no matter what, Ash is the one that makes the whole circus ride without a doubt a experience you don't want to miss.",9,1,3,22 April 2013
The Conjuring," It's a Really Creepy Movie Indeed But Not Fully On Scary!
","Having heard everything about how this movie is supposed to be terrifying and you wouldn't sleep for day's Well, the hype is over-hyped and it kinda bothers me how this movie got a R rating for scares which is pretty silly to me. Yeah their was a little bit of blood and not even a single cuss word. That surprise me because its a horror film. Usually you tend to hear the words S**T and F**K and so forth, not in this movie though. As for the Conjuring its a really fun haunted house movie from start to finish. It reminded me of Insidious but way less cheesier and the atmosphere is very chilling and haunting making it realistic as possible. What I liked about this film is how well the actors were especially Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga that made this movie well going. Since they were private investigators of the paranormal made me like this movie more since I like that stuff. In my book The Conjuring impressed me in a lot of ways 8.5/10To save you from your trouble, there is no cheap pop-ups at all, mainly loud music and extreme tension. Have Fun!",8,0,2,4 August 2013
Her," Futuristic Love
","The first time I saw the trailer to 'Her' I was absolutely drawn to the beauty of what if it was possible to fall in love with a highly intelligent computer. Now that I've seen the movie, I gotta say it lived up to my expectations. Spike Jonze's vision of the future was very colorful and rich seeing the new technology that might be possible for today's time. This film made me think very differently then what I'm used to watching of romantic love. The love was beautiful how this guy became so attached and seeing them happily together made me very happy. This movie isn't your ordinary love movie but it does have its clichés although it works perfectly its fine. This is one of the best movies I've ever seen, it me impact me deeply it changed my perspective of the world and about love.",9,2,5,13 January 2014
The Great Gatsby," Mr. Gatsby Doesn't Exist.
","After leaving high school reading the wonderful novel from F. Scott Fitzgerald,and watching the 1974 version of the film, I was so excited that a modern adaption was going to be released back in 2012 ,but got push back for a useless 3-D makeup. Nevertheless, the wait was well worth it, The Great Gatsby visuals are so beautiful giving the colors a creamy and shiny look expressing the world of the roaring 20's from the classic cars to the rich and the poor. It was nice to see Tobey Maguire on screen again giving a well over all nice performance. Leo on the other hand, he kept this movie going being a mystery man having theses crazy loud parties everybody hosted by Gatsby himself ,but the crowd at the parties knowing who this Gatsby is?Personally, I felt some of the music wasn't enjoyable like having Jay-Z annoying $100 bill song playing in the background yet, easily ignored but, some songs being placed in the wrong places at the wrong time. In the end, The Great Gatsby was enjoyable giving new audiences a modern style of this novel having a great cast giving this love story another chance. 7.9/10",7,0,2,10 May 2013
Evil Dead II," I'll Swallow Your Soul!
","This is a cabin on cocaine!! Ash returns for the role of Evil Dead 2 giving out his best performance yet!! Poor Ash is getting tormented by the demons messing with his mind and himself. Sam Ramini gives out more of his classic camera-work making this movie work how it should be. The woods running, the reversed footage, and gory effects. I loved how ED2 completely changed from a good straight up horror movie as ED1 to a comedy/horror. Its a perfect balance for the Evil Dead trilogy. Ash from becoming a wimp in ED1 to a hero in ED2. What kind of action star has a chainsaw connected to their hand and a their trusty boomstick... Ash of course!! And forever he will be one of the greatest horror icon. This movie will live on!",10,4,5,21 April 2013
