Moneyball," Brad Pitt's best
","Moneyball is the story of Billy Beane, the Oakland A's general manager, trying to compete against 'the big boys' with a small budget team and no way to buy the players he needs. While visiting the Cleveland Indians' management trying to make deals for better players, he meets a young man on their staff who has devised a way to assign a numerical value to players based on their ability to get on base, rather than the more traditional ways that baseball players are rated. Instead of buying a player from the Indians, he hires the statistician and together they rebuild the A's team after the loss of three key players who move on to richer teams. Brad Pitt's performance is stellar; you forget that he's Brad Pitt and believe that he's Billy Beane, which is the true measure of a great actor. This is the best Brad Pitt has ever been in a roll, and he dominates every one of his scenes. Jonah Hill is excellent as the naive though brilliant statistician and Philip Seymour Hoffman shines as the team's head coach who butts heads with Beane time after time over the new way of staffing the team. People in the movie audience applauded when the A's won 20 games in a row; you could feel that the audience was totally 'there' in the moment, because the actors make you believe you are seeing the true story of Billy Beane and the A's. Great movie, great acting, wonderful story that will keep you rooting for the A's even if you're a die-hard Yankee fan like myself.",9,4,7,1 October 2011
Black Swan," Great psychological thriller
","Half way through seeing this amazing movie, I was convinced Natalie Portman should win Best Actress at the Oscars and Golden Globes. This is an intricate, disturbing and fascinating look into the psyche of a young woman who has been molded by an over-protective bitter mother, and who lives more in the space of a week than she did in the rest of her life. The screenplay, cinematography, music and costuming should all be at least nominated for Golden Globes and Oscars. It gives a realistic glimpse into the hard reality behind the beauty of the ballet, and the soundtrack is perfect for the story in every scene. The action jumps back and forth between reality and the main character's fantasy life, and it is often impossible to separate them. Natalie Portman's fragile beauty is perfect for the sheltered innocence of her character, and her transformation into the Black Swan is a fascinating glimpse into madness. I'm sure this movie won't get the audience it should, but I'm hoping that it will get the recognition and honors it deserves.",10,3,7,18 December 2010
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," More than just a coming of age movie
","Logan Lerman, Emma Watson and Ezra Miller make this one of the best movies of 2012. There is so much more to the movie than the basic plot: a high school freshman (Charlie, played by Logan Lerman) who is dealing with the suicide of his best friend starts high school with no friends, and no social skills. At a school dance, where he stands against the wall watching, he forces himself to go out on to the dance floor when he sees an unconventional couple (Sam played by Emma Watson and Patrick played by Ezra Miller) dancing to their own beat, and joins them. From this brave step to join life around him, Charlie meets Sam and Patrick's friends, all of who are high school seniors and in their own social clique of 'wallflowers'. The other all-too-familiar high school cliques play a part in Charlie's demons, and when he has to say goodbye to his friends when they are all graduating and going on to college, his dark inner life crashes in on him. This story delves into all the issues young people face today while finding themselves and their path in life: their sexuality, falling in love, family issues. Charlie though has a darker past that he's buried so deep that he only remembers bits and pieces in flashes. It is when he talks with Sam about her past, all the while falling in love with her, that his own secrets start to push to the surface. Logan Lerman, Emma Watson and Ezra Miller have proved themselves to be actors with a range of talents, and while Emma Watson of course is very well known from her Harry Potter movies, she shows here that she is more than Hermione Granger in every way. This is an excellent movie that I highly recommend.",9,0,1,9 June 2013
Kung Fu Panda," Amazingly good
","After seeing the commercials on TV for this one, I didn't want to see it. It looked inane and more of a children's movie than one for adults. Today, though, my friend wanted to go, and I was pleasantly surprised to see one of the best movies I've seen this year. I was first struck by the art work... not the CG/animation but the artwork, the backgrounds and sets of the scenes. They're stunningly beautiful, as is the soundtrack. Then the story pulled me in, even the minor things like why a Panda has a goose for a father. I really liked the 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'-type action scenes; they were really well done, using the characteristics of each character to add to what the character was able to do. The villain was especially well done, intimidating but not over-the-top scary that would scare small children. (There were many children in the theatre of course, but the movie kept them interested apparently because they were all well-behaved, engrossed in the movie.) The acting was well done as well. I'd wondered if Jack Black would be as funny when you can't see his physical humor, but I shouldn't have worried. I read a review of the movie this week that said Angelina Jolie wasn't very good. I'm not really a fan of hers, but I don't know what movie that reviewer saw; I thought she was great. In fact, I wish there had been more scenes and actions with the 5 Kung Fu warriors, the Monkey, the Snake, the Mantis, the Tiger and the Stork. They were all excellent as was the Kung Fu Master, voiced by Dustin Hoffman. Hopefully, there will be a sequel (done as well as this one was) and we will see more of those characters, and find out about Po's father.",8,6,9,8 June 2008
Monster," Great movie, and I'll never watch it again.
","Charlize Theron deserved her Oscar, maybe more than any other actress who's ever won it. I had no idea what she actually looks like before I saw this movie, and when I did see her, at the Academy Awards, I absolutely couldn't believe it was the same person. Incredible make-up, as well as her acting, went in to the most incredible characterization I've ever seen. But this movie was horribly depressing; what a terrible life that woman lived, and while you can understand why she did what she did, you can never condone it. Directing, cinematography, acting, screenplay... all great, but to me, this is not 'entertainment.' A documentary, or a book, about this woman is understandable, but not a movie meant for entertainment.",9,1,2,2 July 2007
We Were Soldiers," Not What I Expected
","I didn't see this movie when it was released. I felt, after seeing Braveheart, that what I was going to see was a pro-Vietnam War movie, like what John Wayne did in The Green Berets. I was wrong, and I wish I'd seen this in the movie theater. I saw it tonite on TV, Memorial Day Weekend, with so many other war movies on so many channels. I felt it gave an accurate, realistic portrayal of that war, both pro and con. The cinematography was very effective, showing the confusion and chaos of a battle scene, pulling the audience into the battle. Mel Gibson, Sam Elliot and Barry Pepper were very good, and Greg Kinnear was surprisingly good. The attention to detail was excellent, and graphic. I don't know what this movie is rated, and since I saw it on TV, I'm sure much of it was cut, but the violence is very effective. Just as an example, when they show the first American death, and the camera is focused on the soldier's eyes, as he dies you see his pupils dilate. I'm sure, as a nurse, I noticed a lot of this sort of detail that maybe gets missed, but it certainly adds to the reality of the movie. I intend to rent this so I can see it uncut, and I'm going to buy the book. I'm sure the movie couldn't include everything, but what was there is excellent.",9,2,3,28 May 2006
Ocean's Thirteen," The Best of the Three
","It surprised me, as Ocean's 12 wasn't as good as 11, and I just assumed this one wouldn't be either... the way sequels usually go. I liked that the plot was more involved, and that different characters, such as Karl Reiner's character, had more of a part. It was great to see Pacino, and the references to Sinatra were classic: 'Screw Sinatra's hand...' which causes Reuben to have a heart attack. :) Also a great way to scam Andy Garcia's character, and then he has no choice but to accept it! I bet Oprah Winfrey loved doing that scene for this movie. Good plot, good acting, great scenes of Las Vegas, especially the CG scenes with Pacino's casino in the middle of Vegas. Great entertainment.",8,0,2,2 July 2007
Ratatouille," Good animation, but not the best Pixar
","First, I have to say that Pixar movies are amazing, and Ratatouille is no exception. Great animation, especially the views of Paris at night (of course, how could a view of Paris at night not be incredible?), the scene when Remy is swept away through the sewers under Paris and the first 'chase' scene in the restaurant's kitchen, when the cooks are trying to catch the rat. I liked that the other rats seem more like rats, swarming through the garbage or when the old lady's ceiling collapses and is full of rats. But I still wouldn't rank this with Nemo, Toy Story or Bug's Life, and I can't quite say why. I thought the first hour was much more enjoyable than the rest of the movie; by that time, the jokes didn't seem as funny, it was a little too slow-moving, and I just wasn't as interested. But it is a good movie. The audience I was in was enjoying it, but not, I thought, as much as the audiences for Nemo or Toy Story. Even though I thought the story idea was good, other than the woman chef, the other characters just didn't seem as interesting by half way through the movie. Still, it's a fun summer movie. The animated short at the beginning, 'Lifted', was excellent, really inspired, and got many more laughs than Ratatouille.",7,0,4,2 July 2007
Shrek the Third," One Too Many Shreks
","It's too bad studios don't know when to quit when they're ahead-- and I'd be willing to bet that there's a Shrek 4 on the horizon. Mark your calendar to remind yourself not to go. This one was just too much... to much pushing to find the jokes; too many predictable jokes; having Merlin as an old hippie and as the deus ex machina to magically send them back to Far Far Away was way too much. The princesses were predictable and not funny. The baby Shreks were disturbingly ugly, sort of baby-Bobby-Hills and not in a good way. The baby donkey/dragons were cute, but there wasn't enough of the donkey-dragon relationship which probably would have helped the movie, even if it didn't have much to do with the story. There were so many '3 movies' this summer, it was hard to know which to avoid, but Shrek was definitely one of them. Not worth the price of the ticket, but if you have to see it, wait until you can rent the DVD.",5,0,1,26 August 2007
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," I half expected his head to spin around
","If you're not going to keep to the plot and spirit of the book, why direct it? JK Rowling has no say over what they do to her books, but in the first 4, the directors and screen writers kept to the feeling and plot of the books. These books are loved and pored over by millions of people. The first movies basically stayed with the plot and ambiance of the book. This one was tricked up to give it a more 'horror movie' feeling, to the detriment of the movie. Yes, it needed to be darker; the book was definitely darker on many levels, but the way it was done changed this pivotal book in the series to not much more than a mish-mash of scenes that lent themselves to the machinations of typical Hollywood horror movies. It begins immediately, in Little Whinging. Why change the way Harry and Dudley first encounter each other? Why change the way dementors look? Why minimize the shock Harry feels when he learns Mrs. Figg is a squib? Why totally eliminate the important scene when Harry realizes that Aunt Petunia knows about dementors and understands about the evil of Voldemort? (And why have Aunt Petunia dressed in what looks like a trashy sun-suit type outfit that might have been seen in the 40's? It looked ridiculous.) The point of it in the book was to blur the line between the wizarding world and the Muggle world; it was glossed over for no reason. Obviously this idiot of a director and the screen writer don't truly know the books. I could go on with just the problems with the first 20 minutes, and the movie goes down hill from there. Plot lines were chronologically changed. The person who betrays Dumbledore's Army is changed to Cho-- why? That is a totally ridiculous and unnecessary plot change. Percy Weasley shows up working with Fudge, no explanation of why or the background of the rift in his family, which is key in the next book. Why have Umbridge in muggle clothes throughout the movie? The book sets her apart by having her wear a horrible pink cardigan over her robes, which is much more ridiculous look than having her wear- admittedly horrible- muggle clothes. The wonderful feeling of revenge the students have while harassing Umbridge when she takes over as Headmistress is all condensed into one scene of Fred and George throwing fireworks and flying out of the castle-- no explanation of the background of that, of the coming of their joke shop, of the fact that Fred, George and Harry's broomsticks had been confiscated by the foul Umbridge. When the six rescuers take off on the thestrals to go to the Ministry, the fact that three of them cannot see the thestrals and feel as though they're going to fall while flying on invisible creatures is ignored. The intriguing rooms in the Department of Mystery are eliminated, and the room with the prophesies and the duel with the Death Eaters before the Order arrives is condensed and does not show how well the students were able to fight off the Death Eaters, or the fact that Hermione and Ron are possibly seriously hurt. Even though Bellatrix Lestrange calls Harry a filthy mudblood, they left out the crucial fact that Harry informs the Death Eaters that Voldemort himself is a mudblood, that his father was a muggle-- more clear evidence that the director does not really know these books or the point of all of it. Bellatrix Lestrange, who in the book oozes evil and is obviously devoted to Voldemort, is shown more as a madwoman, and disapparates without talking to Voldemort. The worst scene of all is when Voldemort possesses Harry-- he suddenly turns into a modern version of Linda Blair's possessed character in The Excorcist, red eyes and all. I half expected his head to spin around. The crucial scene, where Harry talks with Dumbledore about what it all means, the point of the whole reason for Harry's fate being connected to Voldemort's, is glossed over into about 4 lines of dialogue between them. The only reason I gave this film even 3 stars is because there were a few good scenes, where they actually kept to the spirit and the plot of the book-- Harry and Cho's kiss; Harry's anger both because of adolescence and because his emotions are tied with Voldemort's; and Luna Lovegood; -- were all very well done. Also, cinematography was good. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint have become fine actors. It's been fun seeing them not only grow up, but grow in their profession. In the past, we've gone to see each of the HP movies at least three times while they were in theaters, to experience them on the big screen, and bought the DVD when it was released. We won't be doing that this time. Of course, the director and the movie studio can count on huge audiences for these movies, because of the books, and it's obvious in this one that because of a guaranteed huge profit, they saw no reason to give this book the spirit of Rowling's book that it deserved. I'm sure many people will bring up the point that these books are so long that of course they have to be cut, shortened, manipulated to fit time constraints, and of course that's true-- but the first four managed to do that and still stick to plot lines and the point of each book. This one is such a disappointment. If the next movie is directed and written by the same people as this one, I won't be seeing it. Not that the cost of my one ticket will make the slightest dent in Warner Brother's pockets, but at least I'll have the satisfaction of not contributing to their profit.",3,1,2,14 July 2007
The Da Vinci Code," Not bad at all
","Not as bad as I expected, after reading many, many negative reviews. I love Tom Hanks in almost anything, but I just don't think he was right for this part. I read the book, and it never occurred to me that Hanks would play that part... maybe someone less well known, more scholarly? But he was OK, and Audrey Tautou was perfect for the part of Sophie. Paul Bettany as Silas was excellent. The action scenes were good and the cinematography was excellent. I'd read the book, so I could follow the story but I think people who haven't read the book might have a hard time during the first half of the movie, at least; the book was quite involved, with a lot of explanation to it that just wasn't possible in the movie. I'm sure Ron Howard was thrilled with all the controversy! Any publicity is good publicity!",7,3,6,26 May 2006
Die Hard," Still Great
","I just rented this to watch again, and found that it's held up well despite the years. Great action scenes, great special effects, great story line, and hot guys. What more can you want in an action movie? Bruce Willis' character John McClain is the epitome of the American hero, a man who stands alone against evil and conquers it by his own strength, character, determination and skill. I'm sure that's why this series of movies has been so popular: we all feel overwhelmed these days with crime, terrorism, the loss of some of our freedoms and few heroes to look up to. Alan Rickman, in one of his finest movie roles, is the perfect villain: smart, cunning, greedy and ruthless. His cohorts, built for brawn and used as fodder, are great in their roles. The computer nerd is funny, intelligent and completely without a conscience. I love the limo driver; he gives just the right amount of comic relief in an overwhelmingly violent movie. The 'good cop' on the street is perfect as McCain's on-the-ground support, and I love that he saves John McCain's life in the end. This is one of the best action movies ever filmed, and definitely worth seeing again if you haven't in a while.",10,1,1,3 September 2007
Crazy Heart," Classically good
","No special effects, no car chases, no gratuitous sex. What you have here is a great movie that didn't need any of those things to make it great. What it does have is a great story, great theme, fantastic music, beautiful location cinematography and excellent acting from incredible actors. Based on a story (of the same name) by Thomas Cobb, it tells the story of a has-been country singer, Bad Blake (Jeff Bridges), how he faces the mistakes and mess he's made of his life, and how he turns it around. Jeff Bridges, who has always been a fine actor, gives his finest performance ever and deserves to win the Oscar for which he's been nominated. Maggie Gyllenhaal is excellent as the love interest who cannot bring herself to jeopardize the life she has with her son by believing in Bad Blake's reformation. Robert Duvall, though in a small part, is of course as good as ever. The only casting choice that bothered me is Colin Farrell as the 'rival' country singer. Colin Farrell? As an American traditional country singer? OK, whatever. Actually, I thought he gave a good performance in an admittedly small role... but he still seems like an odd choice for the part. Both Farrell and Bridges had an 'accent coach', and both did a good job with their southern accents. I was pleased to find that Jeff Bridges actually did his own singing, and he was quite good. I intend to get the soundtrack for my iPod. The songs were traditional country-type songs, a nice change from the path country music has gone down in the past 10 years. It was filmed mostly in New Mexico (which of course, being from New Mexico, I enjoyed immensely.) One of the concerts was supposed to be at a Pavilion in Phoenix... ha! Phoenix never looked so good. It was here in Albuquerque and the frequent shots of our Sandia Mountains were fantastic. (I have to say though that it was totally unrealistic to think that a reporter in Santa Fe could have afforded the beautiful home that Gyllenhaal's character lived in... Santa Fe's inflated cost of living due to the influx of Hollywood's stars makes it impossible for middle class people to live in homes that beautiful. But who would know that if you don't live here?) The scenes in Blake's home in Houston were excellent, getting to the meat of the theme of the movie, and Jeff Bridges totally nailed the part here. I thought they could have delved more into the rehab scenes; it was just not enough to make you believe how hard rehab must be... but the scenes leading up to rehab were perfect. All in all, this is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, because it tells a good story, and isn't that what movies are supposed to be? Good stories, interesting, well-acted characters, great scenery and a perfect soundtrack; it doesn't get any better than that.",9,1,3,27 February 2010
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Why do they do this?
","To be fair, it wasn't the worst HP film; that was Order of the Phoenix which was totally butchered. Most of this one was OK. All the changes in the movie from the book, up until Harry's final battle with Voldemort, were true to the spirit, plot and theme of the book. But Harry's final battle, and the fact that Hogwart's was destroyed (which did not happen in the book) were totally wrong, and there was no point to it. In the book, Voldermort and Harry face in one short battle, inside the front hall of Hogwarts, with all the combatants around them, watching. Neville has already killed the snake outside, and rallied the 'good guys' by crying 'Dumbledore's Army' and standing up to Voldemort. There was NO point to changing that, so of course they did. The duel between Mrs. Weasley and Bellatrix was way too short and without enough drama to make you care. I had expected the audience-- and myself-- to cheer at the end of that duel; no one did. The book's final battle between Harry and Voldermort was meant to be simple, one-on-one, in the place they both loved; it was meant to show that love was the strongest weapon, and that Voldemort was no more than Tom-Riddle-gone-bad. On dying he collapsed dead before them all, vanquished. It will never make sense to me why they changed such a basic part of the whole plot. The best I can say for this one is that it could have been much worse. My advice to anyone is to read these books before you see the movies, so you understand what you're missing.",6,2,4,16 July 2011
