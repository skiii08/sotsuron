The Blair Witch Project," Not a spoiler - just extreme honesty!
","This film made me feel like a kid again.  I mean this because I haven't slept a sound night for four days counting.  The last time this happened was when I saw Halloween when I was nine.  My electrical bill will be bigger than normal as I've left a light on every night.  The film really hit me at my most vulnerable fears.  I really don't like camping and waking up to the sound of something outside.  In the film, every time the camera turned on in the tent at night, my eyes rolled and I thought, 'Will this film ever let my heartbeat return to normal?' It still hasn't!  It was truly a frightening experience.  I'm glad I got into it and read a lot about the movie before I saw it.  A few people I know who saw it expected the standard Hollywood film and were a bit confused by what was happening.  They didn't quite understand that it was supposed to be actual footage.  I explained things to them and told them to give it another try.  We saw it on opening night and when we came out afterword and saw everyone in line, they stared at us and realized that nobody who just saw it was even talking.  They noticed our white faces and I even heard some comment on our condition.  What a great experience! What a chiller!  I love the rare movie that can grip your emotions and pull them out and stick them in your face and say, 'Hey, this is what a real movie is supposed to do!'",Null,1,1,3 August 1999
