The New World," *yawn*
","Well, I reckon if you like your plots rather boring, uninteresting and seemingly lasts nearly eternity - THIS is your movie.I like c.Farrel, I do, but even he couldn't make the movie better. seriously.Very frustrating movie. do NOT see it. how it god's name did it get a 7* avg is beyond me. Oh, and it's not just me - I saw the movie with a bunch of friends, none of which felt even remotely close to 'liking' it.you know what? go see Lucky # Slevin, now THAT's a good movie. it is.godspeed 2 the lot of you who do decide on watching this flick!",2,4,9,28 June 2006
