The New World," New World a very artistic adventure into history
","The music stupendous and the scenery was breathtaking. However, it may have been the theater I saw it in, but the voices at many times were too subtle to hear. We don't remember anyone calling her Pocahantas. I feel I didn't really know her name until she was called Rachel. Also who does she marry? The credits told us, but again don't recall her husband being called by name. Lastly, where was this movie filmed? What Indian tribe were these people from? What historians and/or native Americans fact checked details in the movie? Some scenes seemed to be a mixture of eastern religion with Indian culture. All in all though, it was a beautifully crafted and very artistic show.",6,1,9,18 January 2006
