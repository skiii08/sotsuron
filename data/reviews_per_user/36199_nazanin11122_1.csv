Skyfall," what a load of garbage
","i wish they would stop trying to make arty farty bond movies and just give us a proper bond movie. this skyfall rubbish seems to be more about what appears behind bond rather than in front of him. like running around on the streets of London with big ben behind him. or walking around in skyscrapers with neon lights behind him. the script is the worst of any bond movie to date. why do directors try to be clever, you can't all be Spielberg or hitchcock so stop trying. here's an idea, why not just try and make a bloody good bond movie for a change! hated this movie, complete waste of my time. i could have come up with a better bond script in 5 minutes. can someone please tell me what happened to the missing hard drive???!",1,25,51,8 November 2012
