The Blair Witch Project," made me sick
","if you get sea sick, air sick, or any other kind of motion sickness, do not see this film.  it was worse because i was sitting near the front of the screen.  within 30 minutes, my friends and i felt like tossing our cookies. the camera work was so shaky, it was making us sick.  i did expect the film to be a little shaky, but not to the extent where it made you feel ill.  i had to close my eyes through the second half of the movie, because watching the shaky film work was making me feel worse.  i even heard from several of my friends that there were people throwing up in the theaters.  i was sweeting like crazy and wanted to go to the restroom to puke, but i was afraid to miss anything, so i just endured it.  for this reason, i really couldn't get into the film and it didn't seem that scary at all. although, i do admit that i wasn't scared partially because i felt so terrible.  so, if you do get motion sick, then i suggest that you wait until its on video, because it won't be nearly as bad as sitting in front of a 100ft screen.",Null,0,0,4 August 1999
