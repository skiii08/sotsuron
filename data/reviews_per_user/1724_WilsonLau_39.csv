The Blair Witch Project," What were they thinking?
","I don't understand why so many people liked this movie. This movie revolves arround 3 less then bright individuals that head out in the woods looking for the Blair Witch. First of all I'd like to say that a 15 year old can come up with a better storyline. So these three people go to the woods and basically through the entire movie they run arround and are confronted with the paralyzing fright of twigs! Its like watching three mice looking for the cheese at the end of a maze. If these three truly believe that there is an old hairy witch out to kill them wouldn't the obvious decision be to go after her? I mean there are 3 of you. Those are pretty good odds. Oh I forgot these three lack the intelligence of normal adults and so do anyone that enjoyed this joke of a movie. Give me 50 bucks and a video camera, I'll make you a movie that at least makes sense.",1,2,4,3 November 1999
The Legend of Bagger Vance," This movie is #1
","Its the #1 worst movie I've seen on the big screen this year. The acting wasn't as bad as the story which there wasn't much of in the first place. I'd just like to set the record straight by saying that it wasn't my idea to see this movie and I think a lot of you guys out there can relate. After I saw this movie, I thought to myself 'what was the point of it?'. Some golfer who's good goes to war and comes back a pathetic drunk. He's not good at swinging a club anymore so he swings a bottle, gets a weird caddy to teach him and suddenly he's a good golfer and wins a tournament. Thats pretty much it. I just saved readers about 4 bucks in rental money. 0 out of 10.",1,4,11,11 May 2001
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Good Stuff!!
",This movie was really fun to watch. I think Lucas did a great job as usual. I was really impressed by how he did it too. I mean he had a lot to explain about this story and he only has 2 hours to do it in so a lot of things came at you really fast and it was a lot to absorb in a short amount of time. Again this Star Wars was really well detailed. Lots of visual effects and lots of action. The only beef I had with this movie i that Darth Maul didn't put up as much of a fight as I thought he could and the way he died was really cheesey! Oh yeah and Jar Jar was really annoying. I was upset that he wasn't a casualty. But overall this movie was pretty good.,6,0,1,24 November 1999
Meet the Parents," Surprisingly good
","At first I thought it just be a gimmick type movie but I was pleasantly surprised. It had a lot of good ideas and it reaches its goals. It goes a little overboard in some parts but generally its a real funny movie. DeNiro is hilarious in this one. He's just so over the top unbelieveably cruel. Gaylord Focker is the funniest most outrageous name for a character I have ever heard. The racing scene between Deniro and Focker was my favourite moment, just the looks on their faces made me laugh. It wasn't the best funny movie I ever seen thats for sure and that certainly is not what i am trying to imply but it is undeniably good. 8 out of 10",7,0,0,11 May 2001
Unbreakable," Broken
",This was a huge disapointment. Not that the 6th Sense was any good either but this movie was over hyped and I truely regret seeing it. The general mood of the movie was this: BORING. In the end you get a surprise just like in the 6th Sense. The surprise was to top off this horrible movie. Turns out that Samuel L Jackson is a big cry baby thats still bitter about being teased as a kid. So he gets back by becoming a crazed comic reading nerd-villan. I give this movie a 3 out of 10. Only because that kid from Gladiator had some funny moments.,3,0,1,25 November 2000
Fight Club," Family Viewing at its best
","Edward Norton has outdone himself again! I have yet to see Norton play a poor role. Fight Club is a electrifying movie with a great storyline full of twists and turns. Brad Pitt also gives an outstanding performance. If these two guys don't get awards for these types of performances then theres gotta be something wrong. I mean it has all three of the most important components to a great movie(sex, violence, great characters).",10,0,1,30 October 1999
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Yawn
","Yeah i just came out of the theater after watching this one and i had to get on here to warn people. Unless you're 10 years old or younger, avoid this movie and save your money. This movie can be best described as a made for TV movie with a bigger budget. Or perhaps it could be seen as a watered down kid's version of Lord of the Rings.The first 3/4 of the movie was a total yawn. Character development is non existent as we are not given any insight about the personalities of the children at all, all we know is that they're children running away from the Nazis. Furthermore, what we do realize about these children are that they are quite the little runts. With exception to the the youngest child, Lucy, the rest are a bunch of malcontent, annoying, complaining, unworthy rodents. Edmond in particular is an obvious pain and i would not be misty eyed at all to see this little brat's existence come to thankful end. The older sister is annoying as well and there are several times during the movie where she was so annoying that you wished you could reach into the movie screen to ring her neck. I was not made to feel any sympathy for these two. The oldest boy, Peter was a bit easier to tolerate however still not worth a care. How could the viewer enjoy this movie if they didn't care for the main character's well beings? A very good question...The story is seriously flawed and also share painful parallels to the triumphant Lord of the Rings movies. For example the death of their leader, who later is resurrected by questionable, and head scratching means. The big battle that seemed to be lost, suddenly saved by a last minute addition of troops. A character that does not wish to take their role as leader but afterwards taking up his sword and marching into battle... Please give me some credit... please give viewers credit... we are not morons, don't treat us like we are.The inhabitants in Narnia also do no make much sense as they do not seem to be able to follow footprints. The White Witch (aka female Saruman) is all powerful, able to freeze anyone with a motion of her staff however fails to be able to dispose of a child who just picked up a sword 2 days ago for the first time. She forgets about all her powers and tries to swat him with swords. Which brings me to another point... how could children who were given weapons by Santa Claus and have had not previous training be able to battle in a war, be better able to lead an army into battle better then any soldier already in the army? Overall this movie was a real disappointment and falls short on many many levels.4 out of 10",2,3,6,16 December 2005
Spider-Man 2," Spider-man some more... please!
","After being very impressed with the first one after some skepticism, Spider-man 2 is tackling a sequel with great anticipation and even greater expectations. The way Sam Raimi was able to produce the story of Spider-man with such style, realism and above all, faithfulness to the Marvel original comic is tremendous to say the least. The reason why it took this long to make a live action movie for Spider-man is due to the difficulties in making the action sequences look real and being able to connect all the side stories and characters in a single effort. Although it doesn't look flawless, it is still able to fool the eyes. The characters are also faithfully represented.Spider-man 2 is a great sequel for many reasons. First it ties right into the original without skipping a beat. Set a few years after the original with all the same actors and characters. Though it differentiates itself enough from the original so you're not watching a clone of the first. It dives deeper into the psyche and the experiences of its main character in order for you to gain a greater understanding of his situation. At the same time it still provide great visuals, pulse pounding action sequences, humorous side sequences and breath taking special effects and camera work. This movies stands head and shoulders above all super hero comic movies. It delivers what a movie goer seeks and leaves them gasping for more. Immediately after viewing, I was pondering what they will do with the next installment and i am sure that the majority of the viewers were thinking the same thing. The movie is strung together in a great sequence that never ever bores the viewer. The new villain gets a good intro which explains his situation in a neat and tidy manor. Doctor Otto Octavius is a perfect villain which is played and visually represented to perfection. The movements of Doc Ock are fantastic. It's just as i would have pictured it in my mind, if i could... while watching the cartoons or reading the comics. Only Raimi presents it in a way that connects the loose visuals in our minds with the visual reality (of course with the aid of computers). Some may complain about there being too much story, too much Peter Parker and not enough action. One must realize that if it were the other way around, that you'd be complaining that there wasn't enough storyline. People are so hard to please. Even with this seemingly flawless movie people still find something to complain about. The only thing i didn't understand was the presence of Ursala, the daughter of Peter's landlord. What was her role in all of this? Anyways, i just bought the DVD for this and realized that i should voice my opinion especially seeing how low of a score this movie got in contrast with what i would score it.Action:10 Directing:10 Acting:10 Re-watchability(if thats even a word):10Overall rating: 10 out of 10... bravo!Bring on part 3 whoever the villain might be. Venom, Lizard, Gobblin, Scorpion, whatever. Heck bring on the sinister 6!",10,23,30,10 December 2004
Blade," Good give
","This movie was excellent and shows that Wesley Snipes is amongst the best actors of this decade. The film is non stop action, very detailed. The only beefs I had with it was that the vampires disintegrated after Blade killed them and that the martial arts scenes were hard to see. I would much rather see the corpses of the vampires, its more realistic. This guy is none stop action! I'd like to see him in a movie with another action king, Dolph Lundgren. These two guys would make the perfect duo in a martial arts movie!!",10,1,2,30 October 1999
The Mummy," Pure garbage
","This movie was a sad attempt to make a half decent movie with a good trailor to take advantage of the less eduacated viewer's wallets. Well they got the money and the box office hype was the reason but this movie was a joke. I caught about 10 filming errors in the first 20 mins alone. The acting was also insulting to my intelligence. The characters acted like cartoon characters. They should of just made it a cartoon that way you know it will insult your intelligence before you pay 10 bucks to see it. Brendan Fraser's worst movie. No talent, no fun, no thought, absolute garbage. Anyone who enjoyed it was obviously not paying attention, had low expectations or had less than average intelligence. We are all dumber people from watching this movie. Movies like this make me angry.",1,4,10,31 October 1999
The Others," The Who?
","The Others is a sad attempt of a movie. The plot is thin, the characters very one dimensional and the overall feeling that it gave was a huge sense of disapointment after a very long, boring build up. We have seen this before, the people you think you are after turns out to be your own self, such as Fight Club. It reminded me of the 6th Sense(another weak movie), this is of course no accident as it seems like a lot of the ideas are blatently copied from 6th Sense. I thought this was gonna be a very scarey ghost movie with tonnes of ghosts running a muck killing and slaughtering, just general terrorizing and havok. I was to say the least, extremely disapointed. For those unsuspecting renters out there, heed this warning: Pass on The Others, move on to the betters. 3/10",3,3,6,19 August 2002
L.A. Confidential," The secrets out! This movie is awesome!
","Wow, this movie was great! I love it. It had everything a good movie needs. It had action, a great plot line, awesome acting and pretty girls. Russell Crowe was awesome in this movie. He was like a one man wrecking crew. The story was great in that the evil schemes of a group of old cops slowly unfolded piece by piece as officers Exely, Vincennes and White beat up bad guys, and dug through the past to uncover the grand plan in an action packed intense manor. These guys should make more action movies. I know this was not a movie entirely based on action but Pearce and Spacey should definately do more action. 10 out of 10 for acting performances, 9 out of 10 overall. Great stuff.",10,1,2,11 May 2001
Sleepy Hollow," A beautiful movie
","I always wondered why Tim Burton stopped making the Batman movies. They always looked so cool. Well he has really outdone himself this time. In Sleepy Hollow Burton has done an incredible job. Every scene is so detailed, so colorful and very breath taking. It also has the usual Tim Burton gore with nothing held back. Well written, well acted and very well done. Johnny Depp did a great job as Ichabod Crane. I did find it strange that they casted Christina Ricci because she is just a little too young for Depp to put it lightly. Well all in all this movie combines great storytelling, acting and beautiful scenery and is a must see. I really enjoyed it.",9,0,0,23 November 1999
Snatch," Say what?
","First I wanna start off by saying this is exactly like Lock, Stock but if we ignore that which I did then we'll have a good time at this movie. This movie was very cleverly set up. The plot and the events that occur in this movie and the way they put it all together seemed very fresh and unique. This director has obvious potential but he's gotta get away from this format that he seems to have and kinda innovate and variate on his style. The movie was very fun to watch from start to finish, the characters in this movie are very interesting and the acting in it wasn't too shabby either. I feel sorry for the jewlery store owner and his friends though. Glad to see a Brad Pitt movie without Julia Roberts in it. I hate her. Not gonna bother watching the Mexican and we'll have to see about Ocean's 11. Anyways this was a very good movie and I highly recommend it. 8/10",8,1,1,14 May 2001
Blade II," Best action movie in years
","Blade 2 has all the ingredients of a great action movie. More importantly it lacks all the ingredients that an action movie doesn't need. People are saying it lacks depth in plot but I think that the plot is solid, it doesn't contradict, it doesn't confuse, it makes sense. Besides I feel that the plot was adequate and was not as thin as people are saying it is. The movie is of course non stop action from beginning till end. You can really tell the difference that it makes when you have an experienced kung fu choreograher (Donnie Yen). The fight scenes are 10 times more intense than in the first. The characters are really cool, have cool weapons and are just really neat to watch. Wesley Snipes doesn't miss a beat and proves once again that he is a solid action movie man. Enough with the lovey dubby junk with movies like One Night Stand, back to bone crushing, neck breaking action. Blade 2 provides all the elements of a classic action hit, it doesn't let up and it doesn't let down. 2 thumbs up.10 out of 10",10,2,4,24 March 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," 180 degrees from the first
","*Spoilers* A lot better than the Phantom Menace. This new Star Wars Lacks the faults that the last one had. Faults such as making the film too focused on impressing kids so they bug their parents to buy Star Wars toys. This film seems darker, more grown up. This film though still has its flaws. The impressive things were the computer effects and the cool character designs. The battle between Obi-Wan and Jango Fett was very disappointing as was the duel between Darth Tyrannus/Anakin and Tyrannus/Obi-Wan. They were much weaker then the Darth Maul Duel.Although the special effects would rival any movie, it still lacks something that sets in apart from the originals. I felt that they didn't explain enough of the eventual story in this one and left too much lingering at the end. There were also too many slow scenes, too many boring moments and not enough action. Jango Fett dies Darth maul Style as in too easily.The movie has a lot of mind-blowing visuals and effects and in the first 10 mins is already better then the Phantom Menace. Still it was not as good as I thought it would be. Definately not as good as the originals. 8 out of 10",8,0,0,16 May 2002
American Pie," Simply brilliant!
",I loved this movie! This movie is what dreams are made of. Amazingly funny. I thought the comedy genre was dead but this jump starts it back to life. Its like There's something about Mary only 10 times funnier. Very clever plot line tells the tale of a group of typical north American teenagers who just want to loose their virginities. Is that really too much to ask? The entire movie was funny from start to finish. The acting was outstanding. Plus its got that girl that plays Willow from Buffy the Vampire Slayer TV show. She's so cute! Quite possible the funniest movie ever made in the history of man.,10,1,2,30 October 1999
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," It sucks!!(spoilers)
","This movie was really good. Now what sucked bout it is having to wait for the sequels. I want to see them ASAP! The ending leaves you wanting to see more. Kinda disapoints in that way eventhough I knew it would happen cause I knew about the sequels. The movie was very good. Most impressive was the huge visuals of the war, the different villages and towns and the bad guys. What I didn't like were the 2 useless Hobbits. they would have been better off sending a few more Elves or Humans or Dwarves. Those 2 Hobbits(not Samwise or Frodo), I can't remember their names (cause they sucked), were totally useless and caused more trouble then they're worth. Eventhough this movie was over 3 hours it didn't feel long. I gave this movie a 10 because I knew its just a part of a bigger movie and i am expecting big things. Best scene was in the Mines. Best characters were Gandahlf and Legolas.10 out of 10",10,0,0,22 December 2001
The Matrix Revolutions," The Matrix...Retarded
","It's November, and the mindless money grubbing FX machine has rolled out in full force. Now after i've seen this movie and taken a step back, i realized that its nothing but a money train running out of control; riding the previous success of the original.The matrix is a mixed bag of bad acting, over-acting, under-acting, lame moments, over the top CG and a table full of muppets. Now before you call the crazyhouse to come pick me up, allow me to explain. The bad acting is apparent everywhere. Obviously, acting was not on the menu when the director and the casting director went shopping. Keanu Reeves can't act, i'm sorry. Scene after scene of stone faced Reeves cements that fact. Can he express any emotion other than, 'Whoa!?'. Next we have over-acting which can clearly be seen by the lackies riding the robots. Especially that fool, Captain 'Constipated'. Under acting is served up by Mr. Anderson once again as his stoned face is mirrored by Trinty. Trinty, who's finally put out of her misery. They have absolutely no on screen chemistry. Now for the lame moments, they were everywhere. I found myself laughing at many parts that i don't think i was supposed to. I noticed this from the entire audience i was with. From the stupid looks on the faces of Zionians to the stupid poses by Agent Smith. The computer graphics which looked alright in most parts was just too overwhelming. You can't make the backbone of a movie the CG. It looks cheap and fake. Case in point, the little slow-motion punch by Neo delivered to a rubber faced Agent Smithers. Also bad was the little drill machines that broke through the walls of Zion. You know what they looked like? I'm sure i wasn't the only one who thought this but they looked like little turds squeezing through and plopping down in the drain. Now whats more annoying than a civilization in peril, who are controlled by a group who does absolutely nothing to help, nothing to contribute but scorn and ridicule those who are trying to help? I'll tell you what more annoying, when they're looking like a table of muppets or circus freaks. Looks like someone freed the freak section of the matrix and let loose the circus of poor fashion sense. This 'council' is nothing more than a table full of geriatrics with dreadlocks and hippie stink. They should have loaded a canon full of their useless hippie carcuses and fired them at the squids.That brings me to another geriatric. Colonel Sanders, aka, the architect. When i saw him, i started getting cravings for fried chicken. How are we suppose to take this movie seriously when the dude who supposedly created the matrix looks like he should be on a bucket of fried poultry?Now finally comes the count down to the 'END'...that makes no sense:1.The long struggle against the machines. Lets not forget, has been going on for centuries.2.The programs which the machines created to control the minds of their energy providing blood sacks.3.An actual physical war that is ongoing.4.Insignificant rogue program that could have easily been erased. (lets not forget the story from the original where the original matrix was a paradise but didn't work, so they simply erased and created a new one).5.Zion on the ropes and literally about to be crushed.6.Neo the moron, strikes a deal with machines to terminate the rogue program. *Now lets take a look back* Why would the machines need Neo to take care of Smith? Why wouldn't the machines simple unplug the matrix and reset it? I guess were suppose to be too stupid to think that up. The writers obviously didn't give us much credit.7.The stupid fight which ended with a stupid ending as Smith terminates himself, knowing full well that he was doing what he shouldn't.
8.Then the really dumb part comes. Neo had struck a deal with the machines. *Now lets take another step back* The machines hate humans and have eraticated them in the past, bringing them back as their food source. Now that 1 human has helped them swat a fly that they could have swat themselves, suddenly all is forgiven. Those who want to leave the matrix ,can and the machines suddenly allow their food to run away.Now what should have happened in that situation by all logical thinking is that the machines kept on attacking Zion, crushed the resistence and continue living and thriving off the bodies of those who remain in the matrix.What this movie failed to do, is it failed to accomplish its main objective. In part 1, the main objective of the resistence as we were lead to believe is to topple the machines and take back the earth. Have they done that? Obviously not. No they supposedly live in harmony with the machines who have enslaved them for centuries. The tag line was, what has a beginning, has and end? It should have been, What has a beginning takes a break, and we won't show you the end.Lastly, a parting thought...Is this a Matrix movie in the sense that what we were served up in part one was 'the Matrix'? Heck no. All the style is gone, all the flair, all the coolness. Its all gone. This and Reloaded were nothing more then taking what was 'cool' and 'hip' in the original and milking it for all its worth. In reloaded we were drilled by the martial arts and leather jackets, over and over again till we puked. In this installment we were drilled with the special effects.ALL IN ALL: Nothing but a conglomerate of cliches and bad story telling.1 out of 10Bring on the King...The Return of the King!",1,0,1,7 November 2003
Pitch Black," What were they thinking?
","This was quite possibly the worst movie I've seen this year and this is not exactly the best year for movies. The story line was interesting but the characters were one dimensional and boring. The ways the characters reacted to their spaceship crashing on an unknown planet was like they just woke up and were like, hey were on a strange freaky planet we're not suppose to be on, and oh yeah theres some booze. Like they didn't really care, like its something that occurs to them every day. That certainly was really unrealistic. I think anyone would be in shock. And they just happen to have a guy who can see very well in the dark. How convienent! Yeah I know a whole bunch of those people. And I know someone who can breathe underwater to save me just in case I'm drowning. Another part of the movie that displayed how poor the directing was handled was in one scene they are walking towards this abandoned station, theres a few buildings there and a spaceship, then they're coming back to their own spaceship and suddenly out of nowhere they have this space car that their driving around. What is this some kind of magical movie? Where we're supppose to fill in all the holes in the plot ourselves? The sad thing is that there are people who actual liked this movie. What kind of world are we living in?",1,18,37,27 October 2000
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Rise of Arnold...From the ashes of Collateral Damage...etc
","The Terminator movie machine has risen and it has taken the lives of inferior sequels everywhere! As we celebrate the return of Arnold to a role that defined action roles in the last 3 decades(80's 90's 2k)we also celebrate the successful return of the Terminator franchise as it come bursting out into the limelight once again. I believe the success of this movie not only rests on the $170 m. budget, the solid acting, well choreographed action sequeces but it is also the fact that the promoters, the advertisers and the brains behind this movie did not make the mistake of over hyping it. Too many movies have come before it, kicking and screaming before they hit the screen, raising expectations to impossible heights and then letting everyone down in an unbelieveable way.There wasn't much the T3 team let anyone in on, other than the villan was female and 2 acters weren't returning. Which leads me to my subject. Arnold. He's been lacking these few years, lets not kid ourselves. End of days was no Arnold movie, the 6th day was kinda watered down and so was Eraser. Jingle all the Way and Batman&Robin were jokes. So this is a very crucial movie for Arnold in this particular junction in his career. Hopefully he keeps riding off the waves of success created by this film and becomes more selective about the roles he accepts.T3 is all Arnold. Unquestionably the Arnold of old. We don't just see glimpses here and there like in his recent watered down roles. This is truely, purely, classic Arnold at his best. I am talking about Arnold in his coronation days for Conan, Predator, T2, Commando etc. Arnold Reprises his role well, looks good in terms of physical conditioning, and spits out great one-liners left and right. Speaking of his physique, it is astonishing but really not that surprising for a 55 year old to look that good, because he is after all a multi-time winner of the Mr. Universe contest.
So Arnold's huge, the movie is solid, the action is mind blowing, go see it! Don't let others stop you. You owe it to yourself and the last 2 previous movies to see this movie. In my opinion it is the best movie of the summer of 2003. 8 out of 10. Bring on T4.",9,1,1,8 July 2003
The Patriot," Not bad I guess
","I was expecting Braveheart with muskets and bayonets instead of swords and maces. In some ways it was but The Patriot was still a good movie. It was a little too long for my liking and there was a little too much self-American ego boosting but overall if you ignore those things it was a good movie. Very violent, just to my liking.

","Wow this movie was great. It's everything that Gone in 60 seconds tried desperately to be but failed. The Fast and the Furious does it with style. Lets face it, this is a car movie so don't expect too much plot twist and deep story lines. This movie is pure edge of your seat adrenaline rush. This movie is excitement from beginning to end. Every race, every chase is awesome. The plot was simple straight forward to the point and it made sense. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker make a great on screen team. The cars looked awesome too. The stunts we very good particularly the part where Johnny's cousin wipes out on his bike, its very realistic looking any very convincing. The direction in this was great. It was everything you want in a car movie. Those of you who trashed this movie know nothing about cars and don't appreciate them. Either that or you're expecting a huge complicated storyline which anyone with half a brain would know thats not what a movie like this is about or should be about.

","Wow! This movie was incredible. I still get chills down my spine from it. I've never seen a movie like this before, I mean it made my hairs on my neck stand on end. Edward Norton gives the most outstanding performance that I've seen in years from any actor. This film takes a straight up look at Neo Nazisim with very little held back. Shows how racism is everywhere in this society and is a wake up call to suburban North America. Any racists whom have seen this will have to do a little soul searching after this one. Very well layed out, very powerful. Quite possible one of the greatest films ever made.Edward Norton deserves a Golden Globe, and Oscar and whatever else they can reward him with. Consider this amount of talent. Norton will be in many more films to come and should be one of the top leading men for movies in the years to come.",10,0,0,5 November 1999
Ocean's Eleven," Ocean's 11 - Julia Roberts = very good movie
","You probably already know this but I just want to express my positive opinions about this remake. This film was the best multi-star casted movie I have ever watched. Most movies with this much star power only relies on it and forgets that theres more to making movies than casting. Ocean's Eleven exceeds those expectations and achieves the most important things. It first of all has a well executed plot, secondly it has believeabilty in plot as well as characters, and finally achieves the most important thing which is to entertain the audience and avoids insulting the intelligence of the viewer. It doesn't require over-the-top stunts and explosions to thrill, doesn't need to jump off cliffs, get chased by avalanches, or integrate phony martial arts sequences. However Ocean's 11 doesn't get and 11, or a 10. It is a good movie, well put together but it seems to fall short from greatness just a little bit. The talentless phony Roberts ruins it for me. She proves the point once again that anyone could have played her part and that theres no need for her. 8.5/10",9,0,0,19 August 2002

",Jim Carrey continues to impress with this movie and makes his fellow Canadians proud. This movie was extremely funny and very entertaining. Well put together and well acted. The great thing about this movie was that there was no boring part in it. Jim displays his amazing acting abilities here and deserves some awards. How did Tom Cruise beat him for the Golden Globe? I don't want to take anything away from Cruise who is also a fine actor but this performance by Jim as Andy Kaufman is breathe taking. The best actor I've seen in a film this year and he's got good company. I even though Michael Duncan Clarke was better then Cruise.  Overall Man on the Moon gets a 9 on my scale and Carrey gets a standing ovation!,9,0,0,26 January 2000

","This movie was great! I've seen a lot of war movies but this one is the best by far. Great character development, loads of detail and emotion. Spielberg goes into a very great amount of detail with every scene. Bullets are flying everywhere and unlike GI Joe, when a group of people fire hundreds of rounds people are bound to get killed. This movie really puts things into perspective and shows you just how many sacrafices are made during war, too many to say the least. Makes you apreciate the type of life that you got now and why you are able to live that life. The acting in this film was excellent as expected with a Hanks, Spielberg type of movie.

","Well I can really appreciate a movie like this. This is certainly the way martial arts films are supposed to be like. The fight choreographer must have been some damn good martial artist. He should get a tonne of credit. After I saw this movie, I saw Matrix and it made it look like a slow motion, school yard romp. Not to take anything away from Matrix but this movie's choreography was the best I've seen in a film since older Jet Li movies and maybe even Bruce's movies. Zhang Ziyi was very impressive, not to mention she's a total fox. Michelle Yeoh was phenominal and the only part that I didn't like in the movie was how Zhang's character was able to handle Yeoh's character so easily. To be  more realistic, Yeoh would've mopped the floor with her, in reality and according to what i understand from the story. If they make another one of these, I hope they include Jet Li (which i heard was originally offered the Fat man's role but turned it down), or Donnie Yen from Once upon a time in China 2, Highlander End Game and Iron Monkey. These two are phenominal martial artists and Donnie Yen is highly under rated. Hey maybe they should throw in Bolo Yeung too. I give this film 9/10 cause its great but it's no Fight Club.",8,0,0,14 May 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," already got a spot on my shelf for the DVD
","This movie is probably the best movie ever made in the history of movies. The scale of this film is just so huge that it's dizzying. I waited in the cold for 2 hours for this one and when the movie was over, I had forgot I had even waited. It was worth the 1 year wait and it was worth the wait in the freezing cold. The battle scenes, the scenery, the monsters the creatures, and of course the story was phenomenal. This is heads and shoulders above any movie I have ever seen. No other film comes close. I just hope The Return of the King is just as good. 10/10 UNBELIEVABLE!!",9,0,0,19 December 2002
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," The Mark of a good Director *POSSIBLE SPOILERS*
","The mark of a good director is when the audience is given credit. The plot isn't dumbed down, or the film doesn't go out of its way to explain things that don't deserve attention. In that way, Tarantino has earned respect.
Initially i had my reservations about this film because of some of the action scenes i witnessed through commercials and what not. The fighting seemed a little stiff to me and this movie breaks a serious rule in my books by casting main characters as fighters or martial artists. I have to admit, fighting scenes in terms of choreography is very important to me when it is an element in a film. My philosophy is that you do not under any circumstance cast actors with no martial arts background in a film that requires them to perform martial arts. Its sloppy, choppy and only 'showy' at best. Take for example Charlie's Angel 1 and 2, and the Matrix series. Given the Matrix did do a decent job, however i dare you to watch Keanu, then watch Bruce Lee or even Michelle Yeoh. Charlie's Angels highlights my point. The 3 main characters sicken me. Whats next? Are we gonna have Leo Dicaprio swing around nunchuks? Or how about Julia Roberts busting out wing chun moves? Not enough? How about J-Lo, (man, i hate that nickname) squeezing a sword with her rear end? The only mainstream actor who's a legitamate star who should be cast in these movies is Snipes. Snipes would have been good for a role in Kill Bill. He has that solid martial arts background and at the same time he is a solid screen presence.None of the main characters have a real martial arts background, the closest being Lucy Liu. However my opinion of Liu is that she has almost become a pseudo asian, adding to bad asian stereotypes with every film she makes.With all that said, I am not disapointed with the action in Kill Bill. Surprisingly the style holds it up. It was a little stiff but it has its style, its speed but yet it doesn't take itself too seriously so it makes things alright (spraying blood, like from an air pressured hose). I guess what i am implying is that they're not trying to become 100% authentic, and in that way they fail to insult my judgement on this topic. That deserves applause.With the fighting aside the movie itself is outstanding. The style that Quentin brings to this movie is clever and cool but never to the point that it became cheap. I like the colours, the flair, the leads and the transitions. Everything was very smooth and nicely paced. The clothes are very cool, and the settings were eye catching. The only beef i have is the little references to the Great One. No not Gretz, Bruce Lee. Nobody wears the number 99 and for the same reasons i believe that nobody should wear the Yellow jumpsuit that Bruce wore in Game of Death and certainly nobody should wear the Kato mask much less a bunch of lackies. Unless you can prove without a shadow of a doubt that you can be as good as Bruce, (and nobody since Bruce has even come close, i don't care what anyone says, not Jet, not Jackie, gimmie a break) you don't wear the Yellow jumpsuit or any rendition of it.I also like the little short anime scene. It brought out a lot of flare and its something only Tarantino would be creative enough to think up. It brought a nice little boost to the movie which already had a very good pace.So...Kill Bill was good...See it9/10",6,0,1,25 October 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," The Matrix, Rebloated
","The most disappointing sequel in recent memory. I felt like i was watching Mortal Kombat 2 all over again. It was like a horrible nightmare. There was tons of action, so much so that it became boring if you could believe that. Lots of pointless action and lots of pointlessness, for example the dance club scene. If i wanted to see people dance i would go to a club myself, not pay 15 bucks to see it in a theatre.There was too much Kung Fu in it. I didn't believe it would be possible but the Matrix ruined something that i thought you'd never get enough of. All the fighting scenes were pointless since you knew who was going to win no matter what. So the whole movie was Neo wasting agents over and over and over again. The special effects were top notch but i don't care how much special effects are in it, it still sucked. Star wars episode 2 was all special effects but that didn't stop that ship from sinking and it certainly didn't stop this one. The ending was one of the worst i had ever seen in a sequel. The might as well have ended it after the opening credits because the movie was pointless.The entire time i was watching it, I was waiting for the movie to come out of its sleepy boring state and wake up to the real story, the real point but it never did. It was as if i was watching a 2 and a half hour long trailer.Well the Matrix did succeed however. It succeeded by suckering me into watching it and wasting my money.And it will continue to do so to others for months to come.The matrix is a very huge, very complex sucking machine that will have repercussions echoing through time, disappointing complex matrices of people worldwide. And just think, there's another batch of humans, paying to be blown away by disappointment right now as you read this.0 out of 10",1,0,0,15 May 2003
Enemy at the Gates," Great movie, Solid movie
","The story of this movie is great. I love the suspense and anticipation. Enemy at the Gates is truly a work of art and a time capsuled masterpiece of a time in history read about and written about but never experienced with such vivid detail. Jude Law's portrayal of Zaitsev is very convincing. The direction of this movie is near flawlessness. The characters are well portrayed. You don't get a sense of emptiness like you do with a lot of poorly made films. You know where they throw in a couple of characters, don't explain anything about them and do a bad job of portraying the character's personalities. Leaving us wondering who the heck are these strangers and why we should have any kinds of feelings towards them. EATG doesn't do that. You can get an idea of what this people must be feeling, how they are you know? This movie is really enthrawling and I really enjoyed it. I would definately buy this on DVD.9 out of 10",9,0,2,3 April 2002
The Green Mile," Awesome!!
","We rarely see this kind of acting ability displayed by anyone but with an incredible story like this its hard to ignore the performances by Hanks, Clarke, Cromwell and everyone that was in this movie. This is truely one of the greatest films ever made and without question ranks up there with Shawshank. This story takes place in 1935 in a death row ward of a prison and revolves around five prison guards which includes Hanks, Morse(The Rock), and the Bible preaching sniper from Saving Private Ryan and a group of murderers and misfits. A dim, dark and hopeless atmosphere. In comes Michael Clarke Duncan(Armageddon) and suddenly good things start to happen before the inevitable executions. One of the best Stephen King movies. I'd have to say its just as good if not better then the Shining eventhough they are different in genre. 10 out of 10 on this one. Oscars all around!",9,0,0,24 December 1999
Signs," A very good movie!
","My first thoughts after this movie is that finally this director has mad a good movie. For I have been quite disappointed at his previous overrated efforts. Thos of course were the very boring, one-punch movies, unbreakable and 6th sense, I disliked them so much that I don't think the deserved to be capitalized. However Signs on the other hand is a gem amongst a pile of dirt. Signs is a very effective tale of suspense, thrills and frights. First of all it relates to the viewers in that the characters and locations are very typical, small town folks that are easy to understand and relate to. Secondly it plays upon a common theme of someone watching you, someone of course that you don't see. Finally when you do see them you realized that you were better off before. It has a realistic portrayal of the reactions of mankind to an invasion of enormous magnitudes. There aren't laser beams everywhere with little space ships buzzing all over the place. The thing I like about it the most was that there wasn't any disgusting showings of over-patriotism that are common in such films as Independance Day, The Patriot etc. Such patriotism can induce vommiting. There aren't any over-the-top Power Ranger type action sequences. It does however just falls short of greatness. It does have a ending such as the other 2 films however the its not stupid like in unbreakable, and its not as predictable as 6th sense. Furthermore its not like 'oh, so its that way? Well..who cares?' the ending does have significance unlike 6th sense where is just seems like the ending was not like 'so what? who cares if he's a ghost'.  9/10 well done. Chalk up another one for Gibson.",9,0,1,19 August 2002
X2: X-Men United," As sharp as adamantium
","X2 did for Xmen what Blade 2 did for Blade. This is an extremely good sequel and undoubtedly better than the first. The action is better, and with a bigger budget it'd better be. The opening sequence was mind blowing however it did make the rest of the movie a little dull since it was such a huge opening. They do a much better job developing some of the characters but i think that Cyclops is a lost cause. Storm is a lot better in this one but of course after the first, she couldn't be any worse honestly. At least she didn't spout off any cheeseball lines. The story line is solid and lays the foundation for a promising trilogy. It lacks many of the storylines from the comics and cartoons but you can't ask for too much because it'd be quite difficult to pull off some of the things that the Xmen do on a daily basis in the comics and it'd take forever to explain the storylines and backgrounds or all the Xmen. Tackling the main characters and only the main ones seems to be the next best way to go and Singer does a good job laying it all out.In my opinion, X2 is the real deal and the true hit of this early summer movie barrage, The Matrix to me is a huge flop. I don't care what anyone says, The Matrix Reloaded was trash. My only suggestion for the next Xmen film is to have a new villain like Mr. Sinister, Juggernaut or Apocalypse. The whole Professor X, Magneto (with the bad costume) thingy is getting kind of tiresome. Also, when do they reveal that Mystique is Rogue's stepmother and is responsible for Rogue's powers? If she ever gets her powers in these movies. Maybe she's fated to stay a useless, maiden in distress.Anyhow, Xmen 2: Xmen United gets a 9 out of 10",9,0,0,15 May 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Return of the Bling
","There's nothing much to say about this movie, other than that it was amazing. Nothing else quite describes it. Fantastic ending to a fantastic story. The flow of this film was great. Not many slow parts at all. Gives you a sense of whole, or completeness that Matrix could not come close to. Filming these films all in one shot really gives it that advantage of making it all seamless unlike other trilogies or sequels that just don't measure up.Another spot is anxiously waiting on my DVD shelf for this one.10 out of 10...the perfect movie.",10,0,0,17 December 2003
The Matrix," Morpheus' and Neo's Excellent Adventures
","Very Exciting! In a summer filled with Star Wars this movie held its own and then some. Packed with breath taking visual effects and electrifying martial arts sequences combined with an outstanding storyline The Matrix is where movie making is headed in the next century. Lawrence Fishburne is the one to watch out for in this. Although Keanu Reeves did a pretty good job I do not expect too many praises from this performance. This movie has it all though,(except for a love scene) I thorough enjoyed this movie.",10,0,0,5 November 1999
Gangs of New York," The Anti-Leo
","To be honest I was not expecting this movie to be as good as it was. I am not a big fan or follower of Leo Dicaprio in any way. As a matter of fact i was planning to explicitly avoid this film because of his involvement in this movie. However as fate played out on a cold Saturday night with 2 friends and nowhere to go. External influences created the opportunity that allowed me to be pleasantly surprised with this film. This movie was good on so many levels that i can't cover everything i liked about it because i liked it so much i can't separate all the parts of the film that i enjoyed. The acting, first of all has to be mentioned. As does the directing, the visual effects, the colours, the costumes and the great plot.This is certainly not the kind of movie one would expect from a typical Leo movie so in that way this is kind of a 'Anti-Leo' movie. The performance of Daniel Day-Lewis was astounding and the fact that he lost out on the Oscar to the Adrien Brody, is unfortunate. Day-Lewis is clearly heads and shoulders above 99% of actors in the world and his talent is clearly evident in this role, Bill the Butcher Cutting. This is coming from a person who previously despised his earlier movies and refused to watch them. He changed my mind about him and thats a hard thing to do. although i loved this movie, i didn't not change my view of Leo and would not change it unless he pulls off something the way Day-Lewis did, which i can't perceive occurring.As I was watching this movie I couldn't help but to think that this explains why New York is the way it is now. I mean I don't want to knock an entire city but it's pretty much the same way they portrayed the beginnings of it in this film. Crime everywhere, filthy streets and crooks trying to swindle you any chance they can get. Pretty much the way it is today. Lets not kid ourselves, even New Yorkers know it. I apologize to the decent people in New York but give me a break, this movie mimics real life with an artistic twist and there's no denying it.So the acting is great, the visuals are powerful and it's an interesting look into the origins of the Great City of New York. I also liked the historical content and accuracy as they added in the scenes of the Irish landing in friendly New York as the escape the horrors of the Irish Potato Famine. 9 out of 10. A surprising hit!",8,0,0,8 July 2003
Gladiator," Oh my God!
","This movie for lack of a better word was spectacular!! One of the best movies I've ever seen in my life! I just say it yesterday and I am still in shock. I didn't know movie makers can do such things but apparently they can. Russell Crowe is who really surprised me because I didn't expect such a great job. The Backgrounds and the settings looked amazing and so did the fight scenes. There was nothing in this movie at all that I didn't like. It was flawless, the perfect movie. I wish they could make a sequel!! Its about time someone came out with a movie like this. If I could write more I would but I am utterly left speechless after this one. Bravo!! Bravo!!  Encore Maximus, Encore!!",9,0,0,10 May 2000
