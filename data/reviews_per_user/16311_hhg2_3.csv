The Lobster," Not for the faint of heart
","I would completely concur this movie ranks near the top of absurdist or oddest films of the decade. The premises of this dystopian, yet contemporary, film are never explained nor defended--they simply are, which can be frustrating when the internal 'logic' of the bizzaro world collapse. It reminds me of some type of comic television shows where anything is allowed for the sake of a joke, even if it means, for example, characters dying and being brought back to life to setup the next laugh line. Nothing is spared to keep the viewer in a state of bafflement. As with any avant-garde type of art, the defenders often 'see' things that simply aren't there, in my view, and this film is also such a Rorschach test.In addition to the lack of coherence, I found the wanton cruelty and violence to be quite unnerving, yet I have a weak stomach for such things. I know not to see slasher-type films for this reason, yet this film gave no warning that it might not be suitable for sensitive eyes.I give it three stars for technical achievement and to prove I'm not a total Philistine and want directors/writers to try new things.",3,1,2,17 September 2017
Blade Runner 2049," Stunning achievement; better than original
","I would have preferred to simply have 'stunning' as my review, but it falls well short of the minimum size for a review! The movie will probably only appeal to a small percentage of the population because it is so slow-moving, but I consider the pacing a positive as it allowed me to luxuriate a bit longer in the visual world the director/writer created. A moody, visual masterpiece that combines the film noir aspects of the 1940s and 1950s with the futuristic sci-fi world view.The performances are purposely understated and all actors put in excellent efforts. The music offers homage to the original but offers new explorations. The movie might be a little difficult for those not familiar with the original, so I would suggest watching/reviewing that film beforehand.I rarely go out to the actual multiplex, but I wanted to see it on the largest possible screen. I actually went twice!",10,1,11,8 November 2017
Event Horizon," High gore in outer space hell
","There are two basic types of horror films--suspense-based and gore-based. Since I can't stand the former, it won't be a surprise that I greatly disliked this movie. Placing the scene in the future allows for some plot contrivances (whatever plot there is), but the 'science' in the science fiction is so lame as to be laughable. I doubt there was a technical adviser within 10 light-years of either writing or production. With no plot and no character development (and some idiotic characters, to boot!), you are left roughly with an Olympic-pool sized bloodbath to make up for the rest. There were some reviewers who mentioned Hellraiser as a possible reference type in their comments, and I would concur. Some of the special effects grotesqueries were good, and that is why I gave a rating of 2 rather than 1. If hack-fest movies are your thing, have at it. I'd guess it might rate much higher in your view! But, if you are/were looking for an interesting science fiction tale, seek elsewhere.",2,3,7,13 May 2015
