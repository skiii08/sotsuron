Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Are people stupid?
","the script for episode 7 is done and 8 and 9 are in the works and this will help them come to fruition. He's already said he's not directing films anymore and it's cause of people like every hater, and complainer, and if people keep trashing him you'll never see them in your lifetime. 10/10. Lucas may not be the best director but fans ruined the prequels more than Lucas ever could. High expectations and whining when he tries to make them better. It's all worth it to see Yoda throw down. Anyone who says he ruined a classic (well, 3 classics) can do suckle on DC's NEW52 teat for a while. Drain that dry then come back to complaining about Saga. Anakin was supposed to be a whiny kid who lost everything b/c of his lust for power to stop what he ended up causing. Lucas created modern mythology and somehow it's not good enough. Go watch musicians act like actors and animated films and criticize cause that's all the haters are good for. Go Lucas. Bring them all back in 3D. I want to see episodes VII, VIII and IX, and possibly some Old Republic films. Honestly, if you read the comics from the 70's to the 90's and expected something different from the prequels you're just stupid.",10,2,6,28 January 2012
Thor: The Dark World," Why haters hate.
","Far exceeding Thor (1), The Dark World is brilliantly shot, well-acted and leaves the viewer wishing for more. In truth it could've been 20min longer but I liked it. People love to complain about this movie *SPOILER* (DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS FILM) The reason Thor and many others shift through one realm into the next is due to a Once in 5,000 Years event called The Convergence, where all Nine Realms line up, causing energy and matter to be able to pass realm to realm as though through a door. Some people can't grasp this and therefore, due to their sloping foreheads, will never grasp this concept. When asked, 'what is your favorite Marvel Film Franchise (?), a noted physicist said Thor 1 & 2, because of how true these events actually are being considered in the real world. (Wormholes, etc.) But back to the film. This is great. Im seeing people say They hate this but loved Avengers, or vice versa. This is ludicrous. Say you don't like Thor, fine. I have no issue with personal taste. All I'll say to sum up my feelings are, working at a comic shop, reading Thor all my life, this is a great story with great banter and action. Even my die-hard DC friends love this movie.",10,10,16,26 February 2014
