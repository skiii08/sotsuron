The Hangover," What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas
","I went to see this title today, and boy I'm glad I did.This movie is definitely a guy flick. During this film you will turn to your buddies and say 'Yeah I could see this being us!' This movie will let you leave the theater with a smile on your face for ten dollars well spent. With its ups and downs, to its 'What the...' moments, and its constant gags that will have you laughing from the bottom of your gut, this movie is a must see for the comedy thirsty movie goer in need of an oasis.If your in need of a good comedy film, I'd recommend this to anyone with a sense of humor. The film does a brilliant job of a 'Memento' style chronology. From beginning to end, this film will keep you begging for more.",10,2,4,10 June 2009
Paranormal Activity," 1 out of 10 isn't low enough
","I got a DVD copy of Paranormal Activity today (With the original ending) and decided to sit down with my subway sandwich and a friend and watch the film. I have to say, it was a good attempt at a scary film, but non-the-less, needs some work.The story focuses on Micah and Katie, a couple who have moved into a home together and discover that Katie is being followed by a demonic entity. First off and foremost, I will give credit to both Micah and Katie (Yes their real names are the same as their characters) for an outstanding performance. Not exactly Marlon Brando, but a lot better then Christian bale and most actors out there. As for the crew working behind the camera, this movie needs some work. I went into this film expecting to be frightened to the edge of my seat, but instead just kinda sat there going 'Wow what is the director thinking??' and 'Hey I can see the stop motion animation there!'. Honestly, were talking about the film that scared Steven Spielberg so much he left the theater. Really? Maybe Spielberg should stick to blues clues.The movie does have its strengths though, for example throughout the whole film I felt as if I was watching a home movie or some old footage filmed from a family trip (Which I'm hoping was intentional by the filmmakers, otherwise I retract this statement). Also the actors/actresses did a good job improvising the entire script (Yes, the whole thing was improvised). Also in the beginning of the film, a psychic tells the couple that the demon is fueled somewhat by anger and frustration, and the more the couple argue, the more violent the demon became (Sort of like Katie's inner demon), which I thought was a good use of symmetry. Still, the movie got too much hype. During the first 'Night scene' my heart was racing because I was expecting something to have me quaking in my boots, but after it failed to scare me, the rest of the movie I just kind of sat there going 'Oh hey look the sheets moved.... aahhhh?' I appreciate the film for trying to scare people Alfred Hitchcock style, as opposed to just gore fests (Like most mediocre horror films today such as Saw), but this movie failed to deliver. When I order pizza for delivery and its not here in 30 minutes, its free. Your 30 minutes is up Paranormal Activity, wheres my money back?Oh and before I forget, If you want a scary movie that REALLY gets your blood pumping, but uses suspense as opposed to mutilated bodies, try renting Psycho, trust me its worth it.",1,2,4,24 October 2009
