Black Swan," Intellectual Canary in the Coalmine
","One thought occurred to me as this movie flailed and writhed out of control: the intellectual life of the United States is in deep, deep trouble. When this movie is the best that Hollywood has to offer anymore--and it IS head and shoulders above most movies coming out of Hollywood--then the world of (American) mainstream film is circling the drain in a very tight orbit, indeed.This movie is the story of an anal-retentive dancer who has (under a lifetime of jealous pressure from her ex-dancer mother) become so obsessed with the idea of 'perfection' that it has become intertwined with her quasi-lesbian sexuality. She displaces her resentment of her mother and her own flaws and repressed sexuality onto a lover/rival dancer and incorporates all of this psychological flotsam and jetsam into her upcoming role as the Black Swan in 'Swan Lake.' That all sounds very highbrow and interesting, I know, but I'm doing my very best to be diplomatic, here, and it really isn't.The worst problem with this movie is the use of insultingly obvious special effects to explain to the dumb kids in the audience what is going on.'Look! She's looking at HERSELF in another person!' 'Look! Her legs are bending like a SWAN's! And she has WINGS!' 'Look! Her rival is having sex with the Swan Prince!' And so on.I'm of two very different minds on this movie. On the one hand, it's well-made. The lighting and scene composition are really exquisite. The special effects are spectacular. Some of the acting is even passable, though Natalie Portman lurches around like a mental patient on Thorazine.The problem is that the plot is dreadful. It's hypersexual, unrealistically nasty and full of embarrassing clich√©s. The ballet director--and I'm not making this up--is an oversexed Frenchman who calls 'his' girls things like 'Little Princess.' It really reminded me of 'Showgirls' a lot. Ooh! Right! I got it! If you want a summary of this movie, here it is: Imagine 'Showgirls.' Now imagine that 'Showgirls' has completed 30 hours of master's work in cinema and just drank a pot of coffee and was in the mood to talk. Except, instead of strippers, imagine ballet dancers. That's 'Black Swan.' GRADE: C-. Things to look for: Winona Ryder chewing scenery, sudden lesbian sex, the director loses his mind.",3,14,24,17 January 2011
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Not Bad
","Well, I didn't like it as much as everyone else here, but the movie was pretty good. It's refreshing to see an American film using the comedic value of the ridiculousness of male nudity. Naked woman? Beautiful. Naked man? Hilarious. Why? I don't know. That's just how it is.The film takes a cute look at American film script staples like betrayal, infidelity, male drama queens, brotherly love, celebrity worship, stupid TV shows, phony, pseudo-spiritual rock stars and vapid actresses, but is detached, ironic and hip enough to make it all work well. Worth the money.I have to add...Mila Kunis is beautiful. It's hard to tell on 'That 70s Show,' but in this movie, her eyes and personality shine in a most hypnotic way.B+. Things to watch for: lame rock star tattoos, bad lyrics a' la 'Him', and Hawaiian scenery. I never, ever wanted to visit Hawaii until I saw this movie. I kinda do, now.",6,7,18,25 April 2008
Public Enemies," Well-Made Cinematically, But Shallow
","Who was John Dillinger? We all know he was a flamboyant criminal who robbed banks, but who WAS he? The question of who Dillinger WAS is far more interesting than the question of what Dillinger DID, but this film, sadly, chose only to concentrate seriously on the latter and gave up almost immediately on the former.This film goes out of its way--with a poor grasp of history's time-line, by the way--to show us what Dillinger did and who he hung around with, but it does next to nothing to explore who Dillinger was as a person or even as a criminal. It hints that Dillinger might be a passionate lover and loyal friend, but shows us little evidence aside from a few thrown-together seduction scenes (which make his girlfriend/heroine look like a dim-witted pushover) and an awkward love scene.Even Dillinger's foil, Melvin Purvis, is a mystery in Mann's hands. Did he care about justice at all, or was he just a fascist on a personal crusade? Was he competent in the least or was he just a bumbling idiot? Squinty-eyed stares can only convey so much, after all.Michael Mann seems to be in a terrible hurry to tell this story, as he is stuck between the rock of having to relate a relatively complete 'crime-ography' of a notorious American gangster and the hard place of keeping the movie shorter than 2 1/2 hours.As a result, a beautifully shot and edited movie that had a lot of promise ends up little more than a dumb, shoot-'em-up action movie wearing the fedora of 'historical romance.' Good for a date, but not a serious film.Grade: C+. Things to look for: Mann's ham-handed and laughably obvious political commentary on the use of torture about 2/3 of the way through the movie; psychotically trigger-happy Baby Face Nelson well-played by Stephen Graham; cool old products (Zenth radio); great fashion sense.",5,470,713,3 July 2009
The Fifth Element," Capital A Annoying
","I think the director, Luc Besson (who is himself annoying), made one of the most annoying films in history in 'The Fifth Element.' The acting, the special effects, the music, all guaranteed to set your teeth on edge. Of course, the most annoying character is the one with the bad orange dye job, Leeloo. Can you think of a more annoying name than 'Leeloo,' by the way? She speaks an annoying fake language and generally CHEWS, MUNCHES and MAULS the scenery. Her acting had me CRINGING. I mean BAD.Then there are the annoying aliens, badly made up, the annoying villains, the annoying Chris Tucker, the annoying flying cars, and the hair-raisingly annoying musical sequence in which a blue-skinned squid lip-syncs to an annoying fake electronic voice.SO. Long story short: this film is an annoying piece. Skip it. You really won't miss it. And, yes, Bruce Willis is annoying, too, in case you thought I'd give him a pass.Grade: D+.",2,12,26,27 July 2007
Salt," Overpoweringly Ridiculous...Simply Dreadful Cinema
","If you willingly go to see this, you are asking--nay, insisting--that your intelligence be insulted. There are absolutely no redeeming qualities to this film aside from its making itself available for mockery with its heavy-handed, unrelenting cheesiness and awful, awful dialogue. I swear, even the scenes in which people are speaking Russian sound stupid.This is the story of a woman--a skeletally thin woman--who works for the CIA. Yes, it's been done to death. Anyway, she...You know what? I'm not going to even go over the plot. Just imagine 'Tomb Raider,' except with anachronism-addicted Soviets running around and a 90 pound woman knocking out men the size of Sonny Liston with one limp-wristed blow.And the plot holes! Does she love the husband or did she just marry him for the cover? If the CIA 'can't find back past' a certain point, do they REALLY let you become a higher-up in the organization?! Please, please trust me. This is not fit to be looked upon. Save your eyes. Save your brain! This film WILL make you dumber.Grade: F. Things to look for: Angelina Jolie's bizarre running style, physics defied left and right, Angelina Jolie in a bizarre disguise that kind of makes her look like Terri Gibbs without the dark glasses.",1,81,153,24 August 2010
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Check Your Brain At the Door
","I'm not in on the buzz on this film. It's too low-brow to be much fun, and everyone in it--from the main character to passing extras--have one driving force: their genitals. Now, sex comedies can be good, provided there are some non-sexual sub-plots (even 'Porky's' had some political intrigue, however lame, to relieve the pressure), but 'Virgin' just keeps going and going, with no light at the end of the tunnel. Even 90% of the SIGHT gags are sexual! Steve Carrell plays the 'Virgin' in the title, and finds himself being 'coached' through the art of the pick-up by his libidinous, juvenile co-workers. He fails repeatedly but, in the end, finds true love. And sex. And apparent happiness. The implication that love, sex and happiness are all tied up in the same bundle is insulting and dumb. Does celibacy necessarily mean misery? Don't tell the Dalai Lama! So if you'd find 2 hours of sex jokes funny--with plenty of the 'P' word to savor--then this is the film for you. If you have a library card (and a sober brain), maybe you should consider skipping it. I give it a D.Things to look for: locked in with porn, earth bong, plenty o' weed.",3,5,10,18 January 2006
Collateral," Character Study of the Psychopath
","Cruise very adeptly plays a hit man who must off five people in one night. Foxx plays the cabbie cornered into playing getaway driver. Cruise's performance is brilliant; he is charming, eloquent, focused, cold and relentless, just as a psychopath should be.Foxx is equally good as a decent guy reacting the best he can to a sociopath who is completely 'unmasked.' I noticed that Mann lets us get to know 'Vincent' the hit-man a little bit...then makes it plain that there is nothing there to get to know. This is a guy who will buy you a drink, and then blow your brains out. The ending sequence is exciting, as the hit-man's animalism just comes on and on, like a one-man barbarian invasion.A very good film.A-.Things to watch for: coyote eyes, subtle hit-man humor.",8,0,0,1 April 2005
The Exorcist," Horror sans camp.
","This film is a very sophisticated look at the controversial phenomenon of demon possession. Friedkin's film presents modern opinions and attitudes about possession: the psychologists and neurologists looking for brain lesions; the liberal priest who doubts possession and fears making the Church look anachronistic by entertaining the notion; the old-school priest who still thinks in Latin and has experienced Satan's reality and his ability to destroy lives.Linda Blair plays Regan, the twelve-year-old daughter of a popular actress, played by Ellen Burstyn. Regan likes to play with a Ouija board, and before she knows it, she's attracted the attention of a spirit named 'Captain Howdy.' Catholic demonologists call this first phase of possession Obsession. As Regan becomes more intimate with the spirit, It becomes bolder, upsetting her emotionally and kinesthetically acting out. This is called Manifestation, if memory serves (I studied for the priesthood, but dropped out). Finally, Captain Howdy takes control and soon we have Linda Blair at her projectile-vomiting best. Full-fledged Possession! Burstyn goes to the Catholic Church, thinking they can help, and meets a young priest named Father Kinderman (Lee Cobb). Together they try to get Regan help, and in the end decide to exorcise her after conventional means fail. The Exorcist (Max Von Sydow) comes and starts the exorcism. From there, it's a terrifying ride.This movie scares you, disturbs you, and grosses you out. However, the characters are well-developed, the dialogue is terriffic, and the special effects and make-up never go over the top. Even though the little girl floats and her head goes around 360 degrees, you never lose the willing suspension of disbelief. You might, however, lose your lunch.I suggest this movie to everyone, but to Catholics in particular. The mystical bureaucracy of the Church is depicted quite accurately with no hyperbole or cynical Catholic bashing. Not to be seen by children you wish to keep emotionally healthy. Grade: A+.Fun stuff to watch for: homage to cheap motel Vibro-beds, flying Ouija planchette, Regan as the life of the party.",Null,0,0,17 June 1999
Pearl Harbor," I Cheered for the Japs
","The acting, dialogue and plot were so stupid and the historical accuracy so lacking that no one could ever have enjoyed this. You can't even get drunk and like this movie. The love-triangle, betrayed friend, 'but we thought you were dead!' stuff is just so trite and mundane that the mind boggles. When the Japanese planes finally show up, you find yourself hoping that a big, fat bomb lands right in the middle of this triad of mediocre acting and puts a permanent load of shrapnel in Ben Affleck's career. Worst of all is the insulting of the intelligence of anyone who knows even a little bit about what actually happened that day. No nurses died at Pearl Harbor. Sorry. No women in service died that day at all, actually. We all know that women made a good, solid contribution to the war effort, but historical fact cannot be shoved aside for the sake of symbolism. The women who died at Pearl Harbor were all civilians and, embarrassingly, were all likely caused by US antiaircraft shells landing in the civilian areas of the island, according to the National Park Service. So there you go. This movie, I am afraid, is sub-dreadful. It is much sound and fury and next to no substance. And if you are a teacher, don't even THINK of using this in a history class, or I will find you.Grade: D-. Things to look for...parachute sex scene, fighter pilots easily retrain to fly bombers...huh?",1,4,8,13 April 2009
Meet the Fockers," Toilet Humor
","This film can be summed up in two words: toilet humor. It's really strange to see the same Ben Stiller of 'The Ben Stiller Show' doing dumber and dumber comedies, and it seems my wife keeps dragging me to see them. In that movie he made with Jennifer Anniston, there was a lot of bowel and toilet gags. Okay. Fair enough. But in THIS movie, barely a year later, we see a dog flushed down the toilet by a cat, and we hear Dustin Hoffman utter the words 'If it's yellow, let it mellow, if it's brown, flush it down.' Not to mention Robert DeNiro talking about making 'number one' and 'number two.' So this lightweight comedy starts in the toilet and never gets far from it. A highlight? Barbara Streisand. Her performance is actually quite good and natural; she may have a future in sophomoric comedy like this. She lit up the screen. Robert DeNiro, however, looked like he knew how stupid this movie was and wasn't crazy about being there.Grade: C-.Fun things to watch for: statue with huge phallus, Ben Stiller's one-note performance, busty housekeeper.",3,8,15,28 December 2004
Shrek the Third," A Shrek Too far
","A movie too many, a laugh too few. This installment of Shrek is so unlike the first two in terms of energy and humor that its almost like one of those cheesy made-for-TV or straight-to-video versions that the studios make just to cash in on the popularity of a title.The movie slogs through a story about Shrek and Fiona having to replace the deceased frog king unless they can find another heir. Shrek's time at the 'high school' is so tortured that you can almost smell the coffee the writers had to brew to get through the brainstorming sessions.Not good, I'm sorry to say. The first two were so clever that this ends up seeming...well...crappy by comparison.Part of success is knowing when to stop.",3,240,339,29 May 2007
Wedding Crashers," Surprised I Liked It So Much
","I'm such a movie snob that I'm surprised I liked this so much. But, truth be told, this is actually a funny, not-too-unintelligent film. It ain't Kubrick by any means, but it's funny. Hilarious, even, in parts.Wilson and Vaughn play two guys who like to crash weddings--hence the title--and pick up tipsy, turned-on bridesmaids. They use fake names and back stories to make themselves more alluring, even going so far as to use fake tears to seem like they are moved at the ceremony.The whole thing goes awry when Wilson becomes genuinely enamored of one of his targets and follows her to her family's New England island, an unwilling Vaughn in tow. The scenes on the island are funny, and the dinner sequence will have even intellectuals guffawing, especially the looks on Vaughn's face as his incredibly cute love interest 'passes the butter' under the table.Recommended. B.Things to look for: Christopher Walken surveying Vaughn's fetters, gay son's painting, semi-clever allusions to 'The Graduate' and 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.'",8,1,5,15 January 2006
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Nope
","This is the best of the prequels, which is like calling Moe the smartest of the Three Stooges.The acting is wooden, the dialogue is lame and high-school-play-ish and the battle scenes are too busy to be fun. The movie seems a rushed attempt to tie up loose ends before closing the book on Star Wars. Lucas doesn't even do that completely or convincingly.I recommend it, but not with enthusiasm. I recommend you watch it just to 'complete the set.' It's not a cinematic 'must have,' but it does kind of finish it all off.Things to watch for: Jedi in hip-huggers, Darth Vader the surfer dude.",4,13,32,22 May 2005
