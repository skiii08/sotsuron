Walk the Line," Absulutly amazing movie
","This movie was absolutely amazing. perfect acting, perfect directing perfect story a little bit slow paced at times but this movie is the ultimate tribute that a people like Johnny Cash and June Carter deserve. I think Resse Witherspoon MUST take an Oscar for her acting because all my movie watching life i have never seen such perfect acting. i watched few videos of June Carter and Resse got the role perfectly. The life of these two marvelous musicians needs no introduction at all but the movie did perfectly show the obsessive love that Jonny Cash had for June Carter. Juaquin Phenix did an amazingly good job and i think he suited the role perfectly. I want back home and started listening to my Johnny Cash CD's over and over and over again and i guess all Johnny or June lovers will do exactly the same. RIP Johnny and June and you'll forever be remembered",9,0,0,3 February 2006
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Great movie, lived to expectation
","i gotta be quite honest , i went to this movie fearing the worse , after all this story is my all time favorite, i guess i read it 10 times and i was fearing that it will be done as bad as King Kong, but boy was i wrong. the movie was not a masterpiece but it did show all the depth of the story , it times it moved slowly but the pace was reasonable , and i didn't need to check my watch at any point in the movie, the first time since i watched hitchhikers guide to the galaxy. the directing was amazing although the graphics seemed cartonish at times expected due to the HUGE amount of graphics that needs to be generated. the director did well by making the movie less violent than the original story to make it more suitable for kids. the only pick on that movie is that it was made for people who have actually read the story, anyone who haven't would struggle to catch up at some points or just end up feeling it's a lame kids movie, but for people like me who loved the story the movie was absolutely sensational. if you love the lion the witch and the wardrobe go to the move and you will not be disappointed that's my advice. it certainly was some sort of a refund after the huge KING KONG size disappointment in KING KONG. i will certainly go see this movie again.",7,0,0,27 December 2005
Munich," Best movie EVER
","It's HONESTLY the best movie i have ever seen in my life. everything about is is perfect , i have read and watched the story zillion of times from all point of views but this movie did well enough to show the good and bad in both sides views. the end result of the movie of HOME being the family and person u love was so touchy it's a personal point of view by the writer that i personally share. the final scenes in front in New York was just a masterpiece and scenes like that is what makes the difference between a Ginious director like Steven Spielberg and NORMAL directors. having the WTC behind them is a clear message for the people that since will get worse unless people changed their track and avoided violence. i almost cried at the end of the movie and the music was pushing me too. amazing music very well suited for every scene. i can say just one thing thanks to everyone who participated in making such a movie coz FINALLY after lots and lots of movies of freaks and other worlds and monkeys of building money was rightly spent on a movie with a message message of peace and love.",8,1,1,3 February 2006
