Requiem for a Dream," a rave for Requiem
","How can anyone, after seeing Requiem for a Dream, believe Julia Roberts deserves to win the Oscar instead of Ellen Burstyn is beyond me. The intensity of this film will gnaw at you, and, simply put,the most harrowing 20 minute final sequence I've ever squirmed through on film. Be prepared to climb back up to your seat when it's over.",9,0,0,18 February 2001
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Asian Awakening
","In one two hour film, the words spiritual, lyrical, mystical and graceful have been shown to me in a way that countless Asian films and  20 years of Kung Fu reruns have tried, but only hinted at.Visually stunning the same way 2001 took my breath away thirty years ago, it is worthy of all the critical praise it has received. The performances by all the actors are extraordinary and it's a shame that of the 10 Oscar nominations it received, Michelle Yeoh or Zhang Ziyi were not among them.  I strongly recommend this film.",9,0,0,19 February 2001
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," O happy days!
","I saw this film again today with a different friend just to make sure i wasn't over doing the praise spilling out of me everytime i talked about it. I wasn't. It's the best Coen film yet: in a long line of best Coen films yet. I'll try not to ramble on about everything you've already read about: the amazing camera of Roger Deakins, the phenomenal music sets up-then delivers atleast 5 perfect set pieces, the terrific acting by John Turturro, John Goodman, Holly Hunter, Tim Blake Nelson, Charles Durning, and yes, even Mr. Hollywood Blockbuster, George Clooney, all their praises are written about much more eloquently in these pages than i could, but i have to mention Stephen Root as the blind radio station owner who is outrageously funny in about seven minutes of screen time.(if only they gave Oscars for a cameo!).                       The only 10 of 2000. Give it a shot.",10,0,0,27 February 2001
