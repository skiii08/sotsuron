Black Swan," Classis and riveting; engrossing storytelling
","The Black Swan was one of those movies that was riveting from beginning to end. From the musical score, the directing, the camera work and to the characterizations brought forth from the excellent acting, the movie was engaging as it was insightful. I've enjoyed Aronofsky films before and have praised his work with the meaningful messages he puts through them, namely The Fountain. The message I took away from the Black Swan was mainly one of transformation. Nina's character was definitely under some psychosis with the situation she was in (mother trying to live vicariously through daughter, a rival's competition and simultaneous attraction, a demanding instructor, etc.) and the movie's graphical meat came through with the literal transforming of white swan into black swan. This works when the character Nina is also dealing with hallucinations which invokes symptoms of a mental illness which is convenient when a director is trying to portray literal transforming into the black swan. As an audience member you understand the whole cg effect during the last performance.It seems the classic tale of Swan Lake was given a twist and modern version and I never would have known it since it seems ballet is an acquired type of performance for the masses. Kudos to all involved with film they brought the beauty of storytelling through ballet to life.",Null,0,1,7 April 2011
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," The Summer Blockbuster Winner
","The theater was packed when I went to see POTC: Dead Man's Chest. The movie lived up to the hype - it was entertainment overload. From the CGI, to the incredible believable acting, to the set designs and the constant backdrop of the ocean I loved every sensory feeling the movie evoked. The story intrigued to the point of wanting to go to Disneyland to ride the ride again. Even though some say the movie was long, the story never dragged. The introduction of new characters -- Davey Jones (fabulous), creepy voodoo witch/woman on the island, and the East Indies Sugar Co. guy Beckett was refreshing and did their parts perfectly. I love monster movies so when the Kraken was released to annihilate ships it was an awesome thing to see.I've seen the other films slated for blockbuster this summer and this one is by far the best one I've seen. IMHO, it wins the contest.Now the ending of the film -- left me speechless. The third installment of this trilogy better explain everything and make me want to buy it when it becomes available on DVD.",10,0,1,8 July 2006
Alexander," review of Alexander - 3 out of 3
","I liked this movie a lot. In fact I am still thinking about it after watching it for the second time last night. So, in analyzing why I really liked this movie that all the critics seems to be bashing I've come to these conclusions:The acting was spot-on. Colin Farrell did a good job. He looked great! He is one sexy man with a sexy voice. He is my new favorite male actor. He should at least get an Oscar nomination. I was impressed with his skills as an actor. He portrayed a man of history that accomplished many feats. Needless to say, I'm convinced Alexander was a conflicted macedonian. Angelina Jolie was gorgeous in this movie. She did a good job despite the strange slavic sounding accent. I would like to see her in a more villainous role. Mr. Kilmer had an interesting role that he did well in. He did a good job portraying a 3 dimensional character.I caught all the symbolism the second time around and appreciated the angles in which we saw the battle scenes, the lighting variances, etc. I was impressed with Babylon. The scenery in Babylon has shifted my view of wicked biblical Babylon from dirty, haggard, open space image to splendid sprawling city with tall buildings, which made more sense when the Bible always referred to Babylon as a city. The eye candy was splendid. The array of accents used by Alexander's generals, mom, dad, wife was interesting to hear but then that also makes sense since everyone represented more than one race. Perhaps it is far fetched to hear all the macedons and greeks sounding UK, but does that mean they couldn't find enough arabs or greeks to play critical roles? Probably yeah. I don't understand all the bad reviews this movie is getting. Oliver Stone's perception and representation of Alexander as the man and understanding the horrible, cruel and wonderful things he did is interesting, intelligent - something I can relate to. Boycott critics. Watch for yourself. I give this movie 3 out of 3 stars. I'll probably buy it on DVD.",9,34,66,2 December 2004
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," liked it better than the first two movies ** slight spoilers
","The first thing I'd like to say is I'm a huge fan of the books and after viewing the movie more than once, I am so happy with the final product. Prisoner is my favorite book our of the whole series. To be honest, I read everyone's review of the movie before actually seeing it and the basic message I got was to enjoy the movie as a movie and leave out all comparisons from the book. This worked and made me enjoy the movie.*On Acting* There were so many things to be happy about. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson did an excellent job portraying Harry, Ron and Hermione. They were better this time around than in Sorcerer's Stone or Chamber of Secrets. I could feel the angst coming from Harry. I was surprised and glad with Radcliffe's screaming 'He was their friend!' scene. Superb acting from David Thewliss and Gary Oldman - they nailed their parts down. Sirius's speech in the Shrieking shack was intense. I was glad the new Dumbledore was a little more 'mad' this time round. Alan Rickman's Snape of course was true to form. If given a chance to show how unfair Snape really is in the books on screen, the audience will probably hate the character even more. Emma Thompson as Professor Trewlawney was perfect. Loved it.*On Directing* Enjoyed the directing. I was left with distinct images - the frozen and dying flowers as dementors passed, the transitions between scenes and the like. I liked the new look of Hogwarts even though it wasn't what I initially imagined when I read the books.On whole, the movie was a lot better than the first two with the directing and improved acting of the main characters. The special effects were average. I was glad everyone was using their wands for light. I was not exactly impressed with the Patronus and I thought the werewolf could have been done better. Perhaps I'm just spoiled with fantastic special effects from Lord of The Rings.I give the movie thumbs up. Looking forward to owning this on DVD as well as the 6th book.",10,1,2,2 July 2004
The Mist," A memorable Stephen King short story
","I read this short story in what feels like a decade ago. It was not that outstanding to me, but seeing it as a motion picture worked for me. I can't shake the feeling of complete and utter despair after just watching it. (The ending scene will do this to you.) All the elements were there for making it a well produced movie. The special effects were adequate, the acting was believable and worthy, and the plot was straight forward and simple. It was an entirely 'what if' story complete with WTF moments and dialogue even I would have said if I was in the same situation and this is what truly makes the movie. The ending scene will take some time to erase from the brain and memory simply because it ended on a truly depressing and gloomy note. I won't spoil the plot to anyone but would recommend this movie to those who enjoyed The Host and Cloverfield. Stephen King writes a mean and lean sci-fi/fantasy short story from his Skeleton Crew collection. I would love to see them make The Jaunt a movie too.5 of out of 5 stars from me.",8,1,2,13 June 2008
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," I liked it
",I really liked this movie. It reminded me a lot of Black Belt Theatre when I was growing up. Uma Thurman looked good kicking a**. The music was crazy and catchy at the same time.This movie makes me think of what actually happens to coma patients in real life...(cringe).Can't wait to see the volume 2.,10,0,1,20 October 2003
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Not fantastic enough to see a second time
","Harry Potter and The Order of the Phoenix is my second favorite book after the third book (Harry Potter & the Prisoner of Azkaban). I don't know; it could be that the movie experience was horrible in the theater. The film had problems starting. We got through the previews, and then there was a 15 minute lag. The last hour of the movie was interrupted with the screen being in half and the roll just dying out. Theater personnel had to fix the film twice. The whole experience left me sour. That being said, the story itself felt very rushed.The creators had so much material to work with to deliver a great film but they fell short. Like Goblet of Fire, events and exposition of said events were truncated to advance the plot. The transitions to get through the plot were not chosen well. You knew when every scene was done and we were on to the next one. I hate this. There was nothing smooth about this, I was waiting to get in the groove of the story but every scene was too jarring. If I didn't read the book, I would have been very confused and bored. Although I did enjoy certain aspects of the movie, like the portrayals of Umbridge, Luna, Luscious Malfoy, the House of Black, Bellatrix, the Weasley twins and key moments like the D.A. lessons the elements were not satisfying enough to make up for the horrible editing.The movie moved too fast to showcase action scenes. More thought should have been given to the script writing especially for the beginning and ending of the book. In the book, Harry is so angry in the beginning of the story and at the end he is a mess of fury and grief and there is a clear feeling of dread for our hero, which is what makes the story so compelling. I'm disappointed this does not play that way in the movie.I wanted to watch this more than once in the theater but its not great enough to see again.",6,0,5,12 July 2007
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Loved it, with reservations
","I loved the new Harry Potter Movie (Goblet of Fire) and this is despite some things I didn't like or agreed with.I loved the British humour. I loved that Fred & George Weasley got more speaking lines and were the hams the way they were in the book - they stole the scenes they were in. I thought the director made wise decisions with little things like Ginny having screen presence and portraying Cedric as a favorite. The special effects were phenomenal, almost on the same level as Peter Jackson's Wing Nut Film LOTR movies. The dragon, (OMFG), was awesome! Goblet of Fire is easily the best eye candy of fantastic effects of all the Potter movies. The Myrtle/Prefect Bath scene was exactly how I imagined it as I read it the first time in the book. Although I was disappointed to not see the other champions fighting their dragons, the extension of Harry's battle with the dragon was worth it. And was it just my theater or did they not show the miniature version of that Chinese Fireball dragon? The Yule ball scene was great. Everyone was pretty to look at. I think Dan Radcliffe does an excellent job of being Harry Potter. The other scene that awe struck me was the graveyard scene. Ralph Fiennes did a great job portraying Voldemort and I thought the director showing the importance of Voldemort being able to touch Harry was a big clue into what is to come with the upcoming books.The things I had issues with:Mad Eye's eye needed to be more menacing. I wanted to hear him repeatedly shout CONSTANT VIGILENCE to the students.The acting of Emma Watson. I thought she overacted her scenes. (Although I thought her tragic scene on the stairs after the Yule Ball was classic teenage drama). I also think all the movies so far is portraying Hermione as being the one level headed friend Harry has, but this is not true. The screen writer is delegating Ron as slapstick, bitter and lazy and it just annoys me.The fact that they can't slap green contacts on Dan Radcliffe. Harry (from the book) has green eyes and they should have changed it because I was so reminded of Lord of the Rings when I was watching the movie - it seems the close up shots of Dan Radcliffe was projecting Elijah Wood's Frodo Baggins.Dumbledore being very off character from how he is portrayed in the book.Fleur was supposed to be head-turning gorgeous. She was a beautiful actress; they should have played up her looks.If I didn't know the book, I would be lost with the strange somewhat emotional intense wand battle between Harry and Voldemort. And Dumbledore's whispered priori incantatem was not good enough of an explanation to me. Harry should have said, huh?Even though I had issues with the adapting of the book to this movie, it is still worth watching in the theatre. There were cuts made to the storyline that was understandable (it was a 700 page book) but I disagree with characters and scenes they chopped, switched, and massaged (Dumbledore, Priori Incantatem explanation). HP Goblet of Fire has an epic fantasy feel to it that any sci-fi/fantasy fan will appreciate. I think my favorite movie in the series so far is Prisoner of Azkaban (for the storyline  its my favorite out of the series, unique direction, better transition between scenes and an overall stronger impact).",9,4,6,21 November 2005
The Fountain," Beautiful
","This movie has beautiful and gorgeous imagery. How this imagery is woven in the plot is pure genius. Every camera shot, music effect, special effect and top notch acting compounded the powerful message the story paints. I am amazed at the incredible acting of Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz; they are my favorite a-listers in the Hollywood game because everything I've seen them in is convincing and engaging. My favorite 'Tommy' character is the Spanish conquistador. And every time Rachel Weisz hit the screen, her presence was magnetic and my eyes were glued to the screen.I feel very fortunate to have watched the 'baby' of this director, Darren Aronofsky. It's like experiencing a musician's favorite song or a poet's cherished words; the imagination and creativity questioning mysteries are boundless and how the movie processes that is effective in the story it chose to create. The simple life and death question is put into a dream like perspective here that I can totally relate to despite the disjointed narrative it is presented in. This movie is art, the kind you want to mount on the wall and have it displayed. This artistic movie is poetry with flawless rhyme, rhythm and flow - short and profound. It is one of a kind.",10,2,4,1 September 2007
The Holiday," Sappy But I liked It
","Holiday is the definition of 'chick flick.' It has everything it needs for chick flick material  attractive male and female leads, drama, humor and a believable happy ending. Two females unlucky in love decide to do a 2 week vacation home exchange. Amanda who lives in a posh estate in L.A. trades houses with Iris who lives in a quaint cottage in England. Both these ladies meet men they were not expecting and discover truths about themselves uncovering qualities they did not know they had. The movie chronicles the journey of these women's self-discovery and it was often humorous and at times heart breaking.This movie worked with the excellent acting, especially Kate Winslet who plays Iris. I would not have enjoyed the movie as much if she was not in it. I should have known I would have been moved; there was a reason Titanic was a huge hit and she was part of why that movie was a success. Her heartbreak was very convincing. I also enjoyed Jack Black's brand of comedy. The singing of the movie scores in the movie rental store is my favorite scene. Jude Law also does an amazing, convincing job of Graham, the widower who falls in love and gets his heart broken to the point of him crying. The Graham crying scene is also one of my favorites.The background theme of this love story was very interesting as well. The fact that all characters were involved in the entertainment industry was uncommon and I liked it. The movie trailers of Amanda's life were amusing and Arthur, the screen writer's journey, was also a pleasant subplot.Although the pacing of this movie could be slow, I highly recommend this movie to all those people needing that fuzzy warm feeling during the holiday season.",7,1,3,24 January 2007
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The best movie of the year!
","I absolutely loved this movie. I have already seen it four times. I can't believe the journey is over. I appreciate everything Jackson & co. has done to bring the epic story of the Lord of the Rings to film.
Everything was excellent - the acting, the landscape, the special effects, the direction. Even though the ending of the movie was totally long, I agree with what most of the people have already said, it needed to be long. The movie ending was as close as possible to the way the book ended.The handsome, handsome men in the movie is worth mentioning. Hugs and kisses to the actors who played Faramir, Aragorn, Legolas, and Eomer!Looking forward to owning the special edition DVD. Would love to see the same makers of this film do 'The Hobbit.'",10,1,1,21 December 2003
Click," Funny with a message
","I enjoyed this movie cause I enjoy lots of movies I watch in the theater. I expected, what everyone is calling, classic Adam Sandler movie machine - Waterboy, Wedding Singer - style of comedy. But it was actually a thought provoking movie. I did like the funny parts. I thought it was great seeing David Hasselhoff in a major movie being poked fun at (the fart joke was hilarious) and there were some very funny predictions of the future (Britney Spears having 23 children).Adam Sandler has matured as an actor by taking these kind of roles. I was even surprised at the twist (Christopher Walken being the Angel of Death). But I knew that he never left that bed in Bed, Bath & Beyond.Message heard, slowing down now and smelling the flowers.",8,1,3,28 June 2006
A Walk to Remember," Excellent Love Story
","This movie made me cry. It was the romance and love so evidently portrayed that made such a compelling story. Stories of love are hard to believe and bring to the movie screen; it usually works better as a novel. The two leads did an excellent job with their respective characters. It starts out as your typical high school movie which was amusing but done well in that it introduces Landon, who is played by a smoking hot Shane West. Mandy Moore was a perfect Jaime. Her pixie like looks and the self-confidence exuding from her character was appropriate. The love unfolding between the two was convincing and great to watch. The music weaved through out was unobtrusive and used wisely. I appreciated that. I recommend this to anyone in the mood for a love story.",9,0,1,13 July 2008
Donnie Darko," Thoroughly enjoyed this movie
","I felt this movie hit the spot for a time travel movie.
There were many things I enjoyed in this movie. I liked the fact that it was a period movie done in the 80's. I loved how the Tears for Fears songs were played out, which rarely happens in movies taking place in the current time. Loved the soundtrack. I like the little details - Donnie's mom reading Stephen King's IT to the hilarious smurf debate. When I first heard that this movie involved a time traveling rabbit - I was skeptical. But after seeing it I can only say that the moments with the rabbit was creepy, which is a good thing.I thought Jake G. did a terrific job portraying troubled Donnie.
I've enjoyed reading all the board messages to this movie about the paradoxes of the time travel presented in this movie.I think time travel paradox movies will always hold a fascination with me. Cheers to the film makers of this movie!",10,0,1,30 August 2004
