The Lobster," Good enough for a kid as a bedtime story not worth for a movie
",I seriously don't understand what the hell director want to convey us thru this movie. Is that he can imagine anything and make a movie and we are stupid moron to spend our money and time to see this meaning less movie. Message to the director if you have wiered imagination make any bedtime story for ur kid not as a movie for the audience,1,2,3,24 September 2017
