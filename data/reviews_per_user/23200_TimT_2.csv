Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A really good time for all fans...
","This film is a true showcase of what is to come.  The effects are stunning. George Lucas' imagination is something we all should marvel at.  Are there holes in the film?  Yes.  Are there weaknesses? Yes.  Is it a good movie? Emphatically yes.  The movie had two strikes against it before it came out - we know the ending which makes it somewhat predictable, and it has a huge bill to fill.  Character development is somewhat lacking in the first half-hour, but you get a true sense of who Qui-Gon and Anakin are.  The pod-race is wonderful, and the lightsaber fight scenes make the original Star Wars fight scenes look like bar brawls.One thing to look for: ET makes an appearance in this movie.  Can you find him?",8,0,0,20 May 1999
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Is there really anything better?
","This movie not only is one of the best of its genre, but also much imitated and often envied.  The main character is still venerated and immediately recognizable, not to mention a line by which others are judged.Truly a classic.",10,0,0,23 November 1998
