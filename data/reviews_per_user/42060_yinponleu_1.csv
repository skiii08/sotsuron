Iron Man 3," Way better than i expected.
","Iron Man 3 is an amazing movie, it has the two main components that makes a great action movie, fast-paced actions and tons of explosions. The first and the second one was good but this latest one was incredibly amazing, it has far more excitement and way more suits. Even though his techs were far more advanced than last time, the movie showed that Tony Stark could manage on his own instead of relying on his techs all the time which i think was a great turn of events. I especially loved the part where his million dollar house got blown up with missiles, fired from helicopters flown by terrorists. This is purely my opinion of the movie and I loved it.",10,0,1,16 November 2015
