Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Why was it so funny for you?
","I am not from Kazahkstan and I don't know the conditions in that country. I don't know their beliefs, their language or their morals.However if I were I would be greatly offended. I am absolutely sure that, what is described in this film is very far from reality and is based on the number one error people do : 'Stereotyping'. Borat is making a film taking advantage of the stereotypes we have (or imposed) in our heads and making fun of them. IMHO this is the lowest sense of humor. What is that make people laugh and voting this movie as 'the best', or 'exceptionally funny'??!! Was it the exploitation of poor people in an eastern country to play in a movie that they didn't know anything about? Was it the lame jokes about women and the size of their brains? Was it the total disrespect for 'retards', gays, Christians of the American south, 'rednecks' and the list goes on....So he takes the 'stereotypes' in our minds and he uses them to mock other minority groups and even countries. I am really amazed that the government of Kazakhstan has not sued yet. Maybe they haven't seen the movie yet because they don't have TV's, or DVD players. Maybe their government doesn't have the money to sue, or the brains to understand that they are being ridiculed?! I am sure Borat knows the answer to the questions since he has made a movie about them.The only 'stereotype' that he doesn't use to make fun, but using it the other way around is that of the Jews. He is imposing on us subconsciously that even in a country that 99.9% of the Americans don't even know where it is on the map, the Jews are hated and chased with no reason at all! It's the only ethnic group in his movie that he doesn't actually make fun of, but instead he makes fun of every one else who has a bad opinion about Jews.So far I understand his motives for doing such a movie. What I don't understand is why people find it SO funny, unless of course they are the ones that like the same demeaning jokes about other people as long as the others are not themselves.I would recommend that you go and see it, so that you understand how sick it is, and when you laugh and get out of the venue feeling superior and powerful, just think if you were a citizen of Kazakhstan and somebody like you was laughing about your country.",1,7,14,18 March 2007
