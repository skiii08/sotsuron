Marie Antoinette," Best movie ever!
","Better than Kubrick!If you didn't like this film you are an idiot. I don't think highly of women but let whose be whose for god's sake, they're always going to rip your heart out. I recommend learn to enjoy their ways and chose not to partake in it, that will really screw with their heads.I have been with many women I wanted to be my wife, but all of them had this fake need to appear one way rather than be truthful with themselves and they ended up angering me because they go through the motions but not the emotions of love, I have to say it was my awareness of what was going on that stressed me out, I knew they were whose? I hate women whose with many guy friends, it makes me sad that the guys don't see how ugly they are, if they were good looking they'd be getting some, right?So this movie was one way for me to see how it's just the environment that creates circumstance, let that be a lesson to all you whose out there, do you really wanna be whose or is it you're environment that makes you want to be one? Isolation is key to real love and better sex!",10,5,10,5 November 2006
