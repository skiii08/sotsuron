The Blair Witch Project," just a remake of the classic 'Cannibal Holocaust'
","**spoiler warning**the Blair Witch is a classic modern day horror - i did not find it scary at all, but it is an interesting film to watch i enjoyed it fully, best scene is when they loose the map, and one says they did not need it. casting was great only 3 actors - very low budget. overall ten out of ten - a must for all horror fans.",10,2,4,4 November 2003
The Others," twist, what twist at ending
",**spoiler warning**this film had a twist - they were dead but if you follow the story line carefully you could figure out that - 1) nicole kidman says on the opening credits 'now children' - the film got a 12 so why 'children' - you going to think like on because you will not understand the story line2) egmount tuttle says 'i imagine hes dead like to rest' clearly taking about nicole as ms mills says that all they haveso these points clearly add up there dead. great film - tom cruise produced it. a must see if into supernatural.,10,1,2,4 November 2003

Carrie," carrie, what a film - sadness, heart break and telekinesis
","**spoiler warning**on first viewing of carrie i thought, what a sad tale of a teenage girl who is bullied by her peers then on second viewing i saw the horror of it, that crazy mother of hers - 'SCARY OR WHAT' and the way she kept carrie from the world then there is sue and her boy friend at the prom - sue spotted to the pig's blood but Ms collins thought she was going to bully carrie even more. then comes the laughter that filled the room with shock on carrie's face. then the surpising ending leaving you with a cold chill. this movie scored 10/10 and would recommend it to anyone, over all its a great film you would want to watch over and over again.",10,0,0,25 November 2003
