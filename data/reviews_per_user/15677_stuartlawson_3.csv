Minority Report," Surprisingly good film
","The last Spielberg film I saw was AI; the last Cruise film I saw (not being a huge fan) was Jerry Maguire. So you can imagine how I was approaching this film. I am pleased to report that, with the exception of the last ten minutes of the film, both men have managed to step outside themselves. This is a dark, edgy film, and all the better for it. It shows some new facets of the director and the main star which I hadn't come across before. The story is intriguing, the plot twists and turns and keeps you guessing and makes you think. Mr Cruise is ably supported by a decent supporting cast including the ever-watchable Max von Sydow. All in all, a very good, thought provoking package, and how many films released today can you say that about?And then we get to the ending. (Possible spoiler coming up.)Mr. Spielberg obviously couldn't restrain himself any longer and just had to fit in some schmaltz right at the end, where it was totally unnecessary and changed the mood of the whole film. I like to think that, at some point in the future, there may be a 'producer's cut'  (no point in doing a director's cut) a la Blade Runner and we'll have a version of Minority Report that ends 10 minutes sooner. Trust me: it will be a much better film than this, already very good, one.Having said all that, a big thumbs up to both main guys for bringing us the most interesting science fiction piece since 'The Matrix'.",8,0,0,28 January 2003
Finding Neverland," Destined to be a classic
","I looked really, really hard to find a problem with this film - if I pay good money to see something, it's my right to bitch about it afterwards if there's something I don't like about it. Anyway, I tried, trust me...but couldn't find anything wrong with it.The performances of the cast were nothing short of superb. Johnny Depp is adding more layers to his abilities than anyone thought possible, including a pretty good Scottish accent. Kate Winslet was (for once) not annoying the spit out of me, and was actually very watchable. The supporting cast was faultless - from Dustin Hoffman in little more than a cameo, through Freddie Highmore as the too-old-for-his-age Peter Llewelyn Davies, to Mr. Depp's old mucker McKenzie Crook as the theatre usher.The cinematography was excellent, the script under-stated and pitch-perfect, the colours vibrant.......ohh, bugger, just go and see for yourself. But take your hankies.",10,0,0,12 November 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Gob-smackingly brilliant
","It's hard to be objective when you've been waiting for a film for a year. Now I've seen it, I am not disappointed.(Watch out - SPOILERS coming up...)Firstly, Gollum is *excellent*. The star of the show, IMHO. He's so far from being the cartoon character that was Jar Jar Binks, and just the wrong side of human. His schizophrenic battle with himself on whether or not he should help Frodo was riveting.With three storylines, the editing was always going to be tricky, but it just about works - just. A bit more of a gentle lead-in as each 'strand' changed would have been a little less confusing. But this is nit-picking.A couple of new scenes have been added that are not in the book, presumably to allow the characters in the scene more screen-space. Given that one of those characters is Arwen (Liv Tyler), you won't get any complaints from me!Gimli certainly got all the laughs this time. I've read someone else describe this humour as 'much needed' in the film, but I'm not so sure - it seems to jar slightly with what's going on in the rest of the scene.This film really is on a biblical scale - think Ben Hur and The Ten Commandments. I can only hope Mr Jackson and his crew get their just rewards come Oscar time. Perhaps this year, we might have a Best Film worthy of the award...?",9,0,0,18 December 2002
