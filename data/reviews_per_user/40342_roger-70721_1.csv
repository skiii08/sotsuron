The Sound of Music," One of the most boring, pointless movies of all time
",I struggled at least twice to make it through to the end of this movie. I gave up after a the first two hours both times. The movie is ridiculously drawn out. I have been informed that the last ten minutes when they are finally escaping the Nazis is actually quite exciting. I doubt that could make up for the excessive torturous boredom one must endure before they finally reach this point of the movie. Utterly terrible. Will never watch again.,1,4,22,1 December 2018
