Hereditary," What did I just watch?
","I honestly don't know where to begin. I've seen so many slow paced movies in my life which I've thouroughly enjoyed. This movie is slow throughout the first hour and a half of the movie and doesn't pick up a faster pace. The acting is pretty bad, the dialogue seems so misplaced and out of the ordinary and on top of that there is no character development. The moms character is all over the place. I couldn't stand her at all. She was just crazy from the start. I just truly feel like this movie wasn't worth any stars, but I decided to be generous.",4,1,2,7 March 2019
