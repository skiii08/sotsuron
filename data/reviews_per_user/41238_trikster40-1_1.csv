Sucker Punch," Go see this movie!
","First things first: Forget ANY critic reviews you may have read. My wife and I have been excited to see this since we first heard about it. We purposely left ourselves in the dark concerning plot so we would be able to just experience it when we went to watch it. After buying our tickets a week in advance, I started checking out reviews the night before release day. I was stunned. It was getting creamed by critics. We were on the verge of getting a refund because we spent $15 a ticket to see it in IMAX. Well, I came to IMDb and started reading what real people thought about it, and we changed our minds and decided to see it for ourself. We were not disappointed. The critics are WAY off regarding this movie. It was great! It was such a visceral feast for the eyes, and the storytelling was so well done! It was a great blend of storytelling, action, and cinematography!Do yourself a favor: Quit reading reviews and trying to figure out if it is worth watching. If you think it looks cool in the slightest, just go watch it. Today.",9,6,15,26 March 2011
