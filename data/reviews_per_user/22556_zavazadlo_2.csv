The Lobster," awful experience
","I am one of the minority here who disliked the movie. Saw it yesterday and I am still horrified whenever I remember it. Yes, the performances were great and it was refreshing to see well known stars playing characters that are against their usual type. But I don't understand why the cruelty was necessary and what message could bring the audience the violence against animals. Although this film is presented as romantic, I didn't find any emotions apart from indifference and hatred in the characters, or actually in the whole world and story. All in all it's boring, too long, one does not understand why the people in the story act the way they do or how does the world where coupling is obligatory work. It's one of the movies I won't never EVER want to see again.",1,83,145,2 May 2016
Just Go with It," crap crap crap
","Every time I'm about to watch Adam Sandler movie I do hope against all odds that this one is going to be good. Or at least so good that I'll watch it to the end. Unfortunately Just Go with It wasn't an exception.Every clich√© of Sandler's movies is in it. Cheap humor, dumb dialoges, non realistic characters, predictable plot, one likely-to-be comic figure, honest main male character (Sandler). So all was as expected. The only thing I don't get is why Nicole Kidman felt the urge to participate",2,1,1,10 March 2017
