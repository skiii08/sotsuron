Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The trailer is better than the film.
","This long-awaited installment of the Star Wars saga has proven to be a dud. After all the trouble I went to for tickets to the 12:01 am screening on the release date, I felt very ripped off at the end.  The movie is BORING. Lucas cast some of the greatest actors of our time, but apparently insisted they not act, as the performances of Neeson, McGreggor, and Portman are their flattest to date.  Perhaps if Lucas had treated this film as a complete story rather than the first of 3 installments, as he did the original Star Wars, he would've made an interesting picture.",2,0,1,12 November 2000
