The Blair Witch Project," Proof that a great marketing scam can convince people a bad movie is good
","The Blair Witch Project was definitely NOT what all the hype made it out to be. I suppose if I thought it were real, like many of the poor people out there, I MAY have thought it was scary..... until the actors started talking and I realized that there was no possibility that it could be real. The truth about The Blair Witch Project is that it is a brilliant marketing ploy designed to sell a terrible movie. Without all the advertising hype and fake information, to try to make the movie seem like a real documentary, the movie would just be a really bad home video. I congratulate the movie team for creating web-sites, fake T.V. documentaries, and other propaganda to play off the stupidity of the general public. As propagandists the film makers truly are geniuses bet as film makers they should probably quit while their ahead.",1,1,3,13 August 1999
