Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Elle Driver, Budd 'Sidewinder', and Bill. Superb trinity to the final act.
","This film cannot be summarized without giving spoilers, but I'll try my best. There are *SPOILERS* for Kill Bill Volume 1 though.After The Bride took her vengeful violent wrath upon Go-Go, O-Ren, and Vernita, she continues on to her last targets. So, her next targets are marked, but what kind of crazy stuff is going down this time? This is not as gory as the first volume. There are no decapitations that I remember, no spurting blood fountains, no bloodbaths at all pretty much. There is still a lot of disturbing images.The acting is stupendous. Uma Thurman delivers a performance worthy of an Academy Award, there are some scenes that just scream 'Academy! Look at me!', but they're pulled off so good, that their purpose is fulfilled. Michael Madsen is the focus of a good chunk of the first half. He's gotten a helluva lot worse after leaving Bill's team, and has a dead-end job, but he's still the same 'Texas killer' he fashions himself as. There is a lot of things going on with his character, and I rank him up their with Uma Thurman for his acting. Dave Carradine is mysterious in his role, and his lines are quite melodramatic, but he delivers them quite tastefully so Quentin's mediocre writing for this character is forgiven. Elle Driver is a treat that I thought would be just another character to kill. She had that super-cool almost sarcastic tone to her voice. I have to say, Daryl was awesome in her role to the point I almost liked her, despite she was created to be hated.All in all, it's awesome. Way better than the gore-flash-fest of the first, and it truly shows Quentin's ability to direct a wide range of styles, and also shows Uma Thurman and Michael Madsen's great acting skills.",10,1,2,16 April 2004
