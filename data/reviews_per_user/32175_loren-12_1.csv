Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Waste of time
","I got to see this movie last night at a screening. I have some friends who had already seen it and loved it. Well, I couldn't be so fortunate. Its amazing that a Jewish person (Cohen is Jewish) could make such an anti-Semitic film. I know people will say that I do not see the irony of the humor - but it really goes too far. Here's what is said (and done) in the movie:1) Jews caused 9/11 (he doesn't want to get on a plane and says, 'maybe the Jews will cause another 9/11 while we are on-board') 2) There is a 'running of the Jew' similar to the running of the bulls where people run down the street being chased by a giant cartoon like Jewish person - the female then lays an egg on the street to which everyone screams 'kill the Jew egg before it hatches' and all the kids go and smash it 3) Borat stays in a bed and breakfast of a Jewish family. He stays up late at night afraid the Jews will kill them. He claims that the husband and wife have transformed into new creatures to which they show cockroaches walking on the ground. He immediately jumps up and claims they are the Jews and starts throwing dollar bills at them and screaming at them to leave.If this movie lasts more than 2 weeks in the theater i will be shocked. Its just not funny. The same joke (that he doesn't understand American culture) is just repeated over and over again.",1,31,247,10 May 2006
