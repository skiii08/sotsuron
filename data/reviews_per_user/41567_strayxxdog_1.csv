The Avengers," Amazing Movie- Worth watching 50 times
",I was STUNNED by the incredible performance. Its an amazing movie and all of you HAVE TO WATCH IT. Its very funny and is action-packed. The hulk and iron man has to be one of my favorite characters. I usually don't like a lot of movies because they're predictable and boring but you have to take my word on this- The Avengers is one of the best movies I've seen this entire year. You will not regret putting your money into watching this. The graphic was very detailed and it looked very realistic and the story line was fun and it will keep you in your seat for the entire time. I had to hold in my pee because of this. You don't know what you're missing out on!,10,4,9,6 May 2012
