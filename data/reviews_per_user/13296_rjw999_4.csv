Ford v Ferrari," Solid, entertaining
","Well done movie. Great casting. The movie moves as fast as the Shelby Ford and I didn't notice it was 2 1/2 hours. If was riveted to the story. I wonder how true to life the story is because Ford and his minions came off kinda bad. In any case, it's a great flick. Nice to see a movie today without all that condescending PC/feminism polluting the story. This felt real, not forced into today's narrow PC Hollywood storylines",8,2,5,20 November 2019
A Star Is Born," Very well done retelling of a classic
","This one will get a bunch of Oscar noms. It's a small town girl makes it big mixed in with a falling star tragedy story. Lady Gaga has a beautiful perfect voice and turned in a great acting performance. Bradley Cooper delivers as well, but with a marginal voice, which is fine. I wish he didn't mumble so much, I missed so of his dialogue. Overall well done movie. Best I've seen so far this year.",8,3,6,10 October 2018
Deadpool 2," Foul and self absorbed
","Foul movie with nothing new/different to add to the flood of superhero movies. It falls I. Line with other movies of this genre. Basic plot with the usual action to wrap it in. I couldn't sit through it, especially once I figured out how the rest of this movie would go. That was about at the halfway point. To that point it was a continuous riff by Ryan Reynolds of snarky, crass quips. And because this is the second installment of Deadpool, he was going for more shock value than in the first flick. It got tiring and offensive to me. I gave it 5 stars for production quality.",5,1,4,25 May 2018
It Chapter Two," I walked out
","Expected more after the first one. It was quite boring and following a methodical pace. Recounting the backstories each group member. Once I had enough, I walked out. Didn't need to wait for the big finale. Boring.",3,2,6,15 September 2019
