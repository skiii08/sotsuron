Requiem for a Dream," Highly overrated
","Requiem for a dream is by far the most overrated and hyped film i've seen in a long time.I admit the film is well made, the acting is OK for most of the time and Jennifer Conelly is hot.Still, that does not, in any way cover up the lack in story, message or interesting characters. Basically it's about three heroine addicts, Harry, Marion and Tyrone. It works pretty good for a short time for them, but sometime they run out of drugs and Harry and Tyrone drive down to Florida. Harry loses his left arm and Tyrone ends up in prison. Meanwhile Marion has to prostitute herself for drugs. End of the main story. You don't think thats a good story? Well it isn't! The message clearly is: STAY AWAY FROM DRUGS! Guess what? Everybody knows that already, whats the big deal? Do people really feel sorry for Junkie and Dealer to end up in prison or lose his arm because he can not find another spot to inject his drugs (big logical hole!) Only the side story about the mother taking medication and going crazy because of it, is almost interesting, but then again not too interesting.",3,2,6,14 July 2007
