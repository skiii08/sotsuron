The Avengers," The Avengers is a well made movie for superhero fans.
","'The Avengers' is an action packed film that was well made and has wonderful graphics and special effects. The plot was easy to follow and the story was not too complex. It was a very easy movie to relax and watch. Along with all the action in this film, there was also a sense of humor in the way of the interactions between characters. However, I was not personally a fan of this film. In order to understand the characters and relations among characters, the viewer has to have background knowledge of superheroes, and past superhero films. I have never seen any sort of superhero movie before so watching this film was not an enjoyable experience. While I enjoyed the graphics and action in this movie, it was very hard to follow and understand.The main goal in this film was to protect and keep the Tesseract, a main source of power, safe. Near the beginning of the film, the Tessearct was taken by a villain named Loki and his army. Throughout the film the team of superheroes comprised of Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Hawkeye and Black Widow work together to get the Tesseract back in their hands to prevent a disaster. If the Tesseract fell into the wrong hands, it could cause great damage because of the amount of power it holds involving global security. The main plot of the story revolves around the superheroes working to get the Tesseract back from Loki. Loki and his army came from a different world in order to retrieve the Tesseract from the Avengers. The Avengers knew how important it was to keep the Tesseract in this world because of its immense power. Various conflicts occur throughout the film between the Avengers and Loki and his army. As the story comes to an end there is a very large battle between Loki's army and the Avengers. At the end of the film one of the sides ends up defeating the other and earns the Tesseract. It was very hard to understand the relations among these characters and how they worked together based on their past because of the lack of character development. Without knowledge of these superheroes and their relationships, it was near to impossible to understand how they interacted with each other. I was very confused during one of the conflicts because Thor and the Hulk began to fight each other. I did not know that these two superheroes do not get along, so I was very confused as to why they were fighting each other instead of trying to win the Tesseract back. If the characters were more developed and explained in the rising action of the movie, I believe I would have enjoyed it much more. This movie is a wonderful choice for a viewer that is keen on their knowledge of different superheroes, but if the viewer does not know much about superheroes I would not recommend this movie.",Null,0,2,17 November 2012
