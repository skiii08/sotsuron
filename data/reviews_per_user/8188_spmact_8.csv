Saturday Night Fever," Probably more for those who grew up in the disco era
","This movie is part of pop culture, and I had always heard about it, being hailed as a classic and a great showcase of the disco era. Though I was born after the disco era ended, I was always curious about it. With that in mind, I thought as a film fan I should check it out.At first I was grooving to the music and was enjoying seeing all those classic and sometimes a bit chuckle inducing disco moves. It was interesting seeing the lifestyle of Tony and his friends, and him being an 'outsider' trying to appeal to the more 'classy' girl and make something of himself outside of his dead end job.While watching, I saw so much that were remnants of a bygone era and would not fly today. From homophobia, to sexism and racism, and even rape that gets blamed on the girl and almost shrugged off. Now I'm not the SJW type, but these were definitely surprising to see in a movie that is so revered.That's not my biggest complaint though. That would be the downer ending that leaves so much unresolved. In the end, this movie was a bit of fun, but it peaks around half way or so and goes progressively downhill as it goes on.I'm glad I watched it because I no longer have to wonder any more, but it's not something I'd want to watch again.The movie is a 6/10, but I gave it a 7 because of Travolta's dancing and acting, which elevated the movie.",7,1,3,25 November 2018
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," This film came out of nowhere and slapped me in the face - while also stealing my heart at the same time
","There are few films that I can say that I truly got lost in. Ones where I was so engrossed that I felt like I was actually living the story and along with the emotional roller coaster 100%. This was one of those films.I have to say that I normally don't watch a lot of films like this. I mostly go for action/comedy/adventure/fantasy type films. Yup, I like popcorn flicks. But I decided to give this a shot because I recently watched the Harry Potter films for the first time (yes, I know) and kind of became infatuated with Emma Watson.Wow, this film was memorizing. I got so attached to the characters, and cared about their lives and wanted them to be happy. I also did not expect all the heavy themes. This not your typical teen/high school relationship flick but that's a good thing. I actually cried multiple times throughout the film, and I think that is a token to how well the story was weaved and how genuine the characters were - and also how good the acting was.In the end I'm sure my review won't make a difference among the 500 other reviews, but I feel like I had to leave one anyway because it touched me so much and I'm sure I'll still be affected by it long after viewing.",9,1,2,12 November 2015
Baby Driver," I normally love Edgar Wright, but this disappointed me in the end. His weakest film.
","I have enjoyed all of Edgar Wright's movies since Shaun of the Dead, and he has made one of my all time favourites (Scott Pilgrim), so I was pretty excited about this one. I went into it clean, without seeing any trailers, and was convinced purely by word of mouth and the director's track record. All I knew is that it as about some kind of heist and a great driver. I bought into the hype and was looking for another winner from Wright.It started off great, with engaging action and an intriguing story. It had some good potential, but it fell apart for me in the third act. The characters did things you wouldn't expect them to, and I was left wondering 'what was the point of all this?'. It had some of the feeling of Pulp Fiction to me (great visuals and style, and you're rooting for a guy trying to get out of a bad situation he's found himself in with criminals), but it fizzled out in the end.It wasn't a bad movie per se, but I expected more from Wright. In the end it was his weakest film to me, and I don't think it's one I'd recommend.",7,7,17,4 July 2017
Across the Universe," I don't like musicals, but I liked this
","I'm not sure what more I can say. I normally get annoyed when the singing starts, but this film does it so well.Very cool imagery and camera work during the singing kept me engaged. The director has a wonderful visual style, especially with scenes that feature singing in the midst of all the mayhem happening around.It gets a bit weird in the middle, but the rest of it was very well done, especially with representing the eras that the story goes through.It also doesn't hurt that it has the classic songs of the Beatles. I definitely recommend it for fans of cinema.",8,1,2,8 June 2014
X-Men: Apocalypse," Not terrible, but definitely the weakest of the 3 'new' X-Men films
","There's a generally accepted idea that the 3rd X-Men film was the worse. Well, I have to say the same about the new semi-rebooted series. The film just failed to live up to its potential. Firstly, the villain was somehow wasted, even though Oscar Isaac did a great job. I remember watching the animated series and being intimidated by Apocalypse (even as an adult). The movie Apocalypse somehow failed to evoke the same reaction. I never really thought he was unstoppable like he was in the cartoon. Jennifer Lawrence seemed tired of her role and was phoning it in. Magneto had a great start, and I loved how they initially covered his reasoning for doing what he did, but then he just gets relegated to the background for the most part, and his reasoning for doing what he does at the end don't really seem earned like they did at the beginning. Things seem rushed near the end, and it seems they were just trying to pack in lots of cool things at the end and it gets a bit muddled. The Quicksilver scene is awesome, and is the clear highlight of the film (again). At the end of the day, it doesn't go full Transformers and highlight action scenes over story elements, but it was definitely leaning in that direction, which was a shame.",7,3,7,30 May 2016
Logan," Wolverine and Professor X get old, sick and depressing
","I wasn't that interested in seeing this after being disappointed by the last Wolverine movie and finding out that this was by the same director. Then I saw all these reviews praising this as a great film, and I thought I might like it.After seeing it, I don't see what all the hype was about. Does making a movie dark and depressing make it good? Personally I didn't need to see Wolverine Professor X all washed up, old and sick. Sure, it's 'real', but I don't go to a super hero movie to see that kind of thing.There was some great action, and it was fun to see Wolverine not held back by a PG-13 rating, but there were too many plot holes and things that were inconsistent with previous things established about Wolverine. I did like what they did with the comic book references though.Ultimately it was just OK, and ranks somewhere in the middle of all X-Men movies for me. It's sad when the best part of the movie was the Deadpool teaser before it.",7,3,8,4 March 2017
Jackie Brown," I was mislead by all the glowing reviews here
","This is the only Tarantino movie I hadn't seen because I hadn't heard much about it, so I thought I should remedy that. I liked every other one, except Death Proof, so I thought there was a good chance I'd like this too, especially after seeing all the glowing reviews on IMDB.
I don't need lots of blood and violence to enjoy a movie, but good writing, editing and tension have always been a Tarantino mainstay that I've enjoyed. Sadly, this didn't seem to have any of those. It's also way too long, at 2.5 hours. It should have been a 1.5hr movie. There's so much unnecessary filler that goes nowhere, which Tarantino calls 'hang out' scenes. I could have used much less of them.
Instead of dragging things on like the movie did, I'll just list my pros and cons.Pros:
-Pam Grier, Samuel L Jackson and Robert Forster are great in this
-Nice soundtrackCons:
-Drags on a lot with a lot of dialogue scenes that seem interesting at first but ultimately made me tired of all the slow pacing
-De Niro was wasted on this. His character wasn't interesting at all
-Story was OK but not really that compellingIf you like the 'typical' Tarantino movie, don't come in expecting the same quality. If you want something different than his other movies and don't mind slow pacing, you might enjoy this.",6,6,11,27 May 2019
Warcraft," Perfectly adequate. Wouldn't mind seeing more
","I will start by saying I'm not a big Warcraft fan. I was back in the day, but haven't played since Warcraft III (about 12 years ago). Having said that, I'm a fan of the fantasy genre, like LotR, Hobbit, GoT etc., so I gave this a shot out of curiosity.I wasn't expecting much from this film since the trailers didn't really get me excited, and it neither surprised me by being great, nor disappointed me by being bad; it was somewhere in the middle. Basically, it was just 'good enough', but not really 'good'. I didn't feel like I wasted my time, but it's not something I'm going to rush out to recommend to others. Perhaps fans of WoW will enjoy seeing these characters come to life more than I did. I just took it at face value as a film, with no bias from love of the game, and found it to be adequate. Many reviewers said it was too busy setting up a sequel rather than focusing on its own story. I didn't get that vibe, though there are definitely hints at more story to come. I am curious to see what a sequel holds, but because of its lackluster performance at the domestic box office, they'll either reduce the budget of a sequel, which doesn't seem likely if they want to recreate the world/characters of the first film, or just not make the film. Or they might just make it a Chinese production since it did so well there. I guess we'll see.",7,0,1,17 September 2016
