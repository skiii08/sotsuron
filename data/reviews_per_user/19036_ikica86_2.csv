Black Swan," Fan of Ballet
","I don't understand all the fuss about this movie.With danger of not being 'smart' or 'artistic' enough I have to say that I didn't like it.I've watched it tonight and I was bored mostly trough entire thing.It felt like it was a movie about psychotic girl whose obsessed mother isn't giving her enough intimate space to masturbate.Because all she apparently needs,for a perfect performance,is to touch herself or take ecstasy.I wanted to shout to the Director 'Why the hell don't you get another dancer for the Black Swan!'and 'Stop molesting that girl!'.Oh yeah,but then we won't have a movie.Like one review said it is a movie about a girl,who is from a start a nerve rack and the play is just an excuse to unleash her insanity.About a dancer,who is played by Mila Kunis I haven't got much to say because director until the end doesn't explain her character.Is she simple a friendly girl,evil backstabbing bitch or just a trigger for hallucinations.All I have to say about her is that she wears a really nice underwear and stockings.Also the constant pointing out between black and white really bothers my intelligence.I get it,without the constant white and black clothes and the tattoo of the black wings.I gave it a four only because of the costumes,make up,music and because I hope that this movie hasn't given me a trauma about swans and ballet :)",4,21,35,16 January 2011
The Prestige," Must Watch
","I will be short and sweet:this movie is SUPERB!everything about it is just perfect for the true movie fan:storyline,acting(being from Serbia I was especially taking notice of David Bowie and I was very pleased by his portrait of Nikola Tesla),suspense,mystery...I have always liked Christian Bale,but now I am stunned by his acting.Jackman is a fine rival from beginning to the surprising end :)I love movies where you have to activate your brain cells and watch really closely so you don't miss anything.And this movie does that in it's best way.It will get you intrigued,curios and wanted to know and see more.So get a DVD,pull up your chairs...and ARE YOU WATCHING CLOSELY? ;)",10,2,5,23 April 2011
