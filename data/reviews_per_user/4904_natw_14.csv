Frost_Nixon," Howard was brilliant, Langella was robbed
","The premise of 'Frost/Nixon' certainly doesn't elicit much excitement. A movie about one person interviewing another person, even if one of them is Richard Nixon, seems like it would be a yawner. But Ron Howard turns it into a captivating piece of cinema. My first reaction was that Frank Langella was robbed for not winning the Academy Award. After setting aside my initial reaction and contemplating the movie, I became even more convinced. His performance was one of the best I have seen in years. Langella did what even Nixon failed to do: He made him a seem like a three-dimensional human being. He should have won hands down. I spent the summer sitting in front of the television set watching the Watergate hearings (we didn't have many channels back then), so it was fascinating to see this movie. But for those who didn't, it should still be a must-see. Not only will you learn a little about an important piece of history, you will be imminently entertained. Frost/Nixon is a real winner.",9,2,6,6 May 2009
Inglourious Basterds," Black-humor romp could be instant classic
","Quentin Tarantino is victorious in a re-write of history with this joyous romp through World War II, in which Jewish-American recruits kill Nazis and put so much fear into the survivors Hitler himself is impressed. Many will criticize this movie, citing its historical inaccuracy, intense violence and peculiar staging. But I felt they all came together perfectly. The viewer is constantly forced to readjust, like an over-matched defender in a football game. Christoph Waltz is outstanding in a juicy role that should earn him an Oscar. Waltz's turn as a courteous and urbane Nazi who conducts his Jew-killing duties with relish is a hoot. And as if viewers weren't satisfied enough with the journey, we are treated at the end with a delightful twist that caps the fun. I recommend 'Inglourious Basterds' with a caveat: Enter into the viewing experience with an open mind and hang on for the ride. You won't be disappointed.",9,0,5,21 January 2010
Milk," No masterpiece
","It's often difficult to provide commentary on a movie with such a heated topic. It seems that whatever you say, you're always conscious that someone may consider you a 'homophobe' (whatever that is) or that you're skirting the issue. However, I feel I have a pretty good compass as a movie fan: I can judge a film strictly on its own merits. Having said that, I rate 'Milk' as a slightly better-than-average biopic, not a masterpiece, as breathless critics fell over themselves to proclaim. Again, I feel the same way about actors. While I personally despise everything Sean Penn stands for, I've always said I believe he is one of our finest actors today. However, I still didn't feel he put in Oscar-worthy work here. The movie just seemed to drag in parts and, while it held my interest, it just didn't enrapture me.",6,4,11,13 March 2009
Crash," Extraordinary look at ourselves
","'Crash' is a wonderful ensemble piece that takes a straightforward look at the complexities involving human interaction. It isn't a clich√©d, 'message' movie that preaches or attempts to manipulate our emotions. Instead, it is a window into the psyche of people in very different situations. No one is all good, no one is all bad, but they all 'crash' off one another in a series of random events that are deftly interconnected by writer and director Paul Haggis. Performances are topnotch, including Don Cheadle and Matt Dillon. Sandra Bullock does an admirable job also, cast against type as the haughty, demanding wife of the district attorney. It brings to mind 'Traffic,' another outstanding movie with a similar, multi-story script, and is no less brilliant. I recommend this movie highly.",9,5,15,6 March 2006
21," Not worth the gamble
","There should have been a movie made about the fabled MIT blackjack team Strategic Investments. Unfortunately, it shouldn't have been this one. '21' takes the basic premise of the true story and throws virtually everything else out. Now, I don't have a problem with a bit of poetic justice; real life sometimes doesn't translate handily to drama. But this movie didn't add anything interesting. The script is amateurish and the dialog clunky. The acting was third rate; even the great Kevin Spacey and Lawrence Fishburne couldn't manage to rise above the material. I believe there was supposed to be some sort of relationship between Jim Sturgess and Kate Bosworth but I yawned my way through it, so I guess I missed it. This is truly the worst movie I've seen in a long time. I don't recommend taking a gamble on this loser.",3,13,23,27 July 2008
Salt," Stupid, stupid, stupid
","Guess what? My cat sprouted wings and flew up into the sky, eventually landing on the moon and starting a whole new population of space cats. That's about as believable as the ridiculous plot in this movie. Occasionally an action movie is interesting enough that it is worth suspending belief a bit. I accept that. 'Salt,' however, doesn't just bend believability, it folds it into and throws it in the trash can. Gee, a single (though really hot) woman can outwit and outfight everybody in the CIA, Secret Service, KGB, Washington, D.C., police and anyone else standing in her way. She can successfully escape from CIA headquarters and a church crawling with agents and police. Yeah, right. I've seen comic book superheros more believable than the characters in this movie. I couldn't believe that professional movie critics actually applauded this movie. For shame.",1,7,16,5 February 2011
The Lives of Others," Excellent depiction of a real-life '1984'
","It is both fascinating yet somehow disturbing that this movie is about a period in history that seems so far removed from modern times yet takes place barely 20 years ago. Set in 1984 communist East Germany, 'The Lives of Others' provides us with a behind-the-scenes look at the chillingly efficient Stasi secret police. The depressing tone of such a society is evident throughout, yet we can feel the twinge of hope that hides within its main characters, even the by-the-book secret service captain who has a writer's apartment wired and listens to everything that goes on in his life. A real-life approximation of the kind of repression depicted in the classic novel '1984' should give us pause. I thought it especially fitting that this movie does not show us state-sponsored torture, murders or other horrific realities that certainly existed in Stalinist regimes. Instead, the threat expressed to those who would dare speak against the regime involved loss of dreams, such as the theater director being blacklisted or the actress being robbed of her audience. Chillingly, in such a world that offered little hope, that may be a more effective threat than physical pain, or even death itself, which at least removes one from the situation. This is a movie that is not only a splendid piece of film-making, but one that has valuable worth in the real world. Those on the verge of taking freedom for granted would do well to spend two hours taking in this excellent film.",9,0,0,14 January 2008
Gran Torino," Clint does it again
","How is it possible that Clint Eastwood can continue, after all these decades, to make and star in great movies? Because he's the man, that's why. Eastwood scores again in 'Gran Torino,' a sort of 'Dirty Harry' meets 'Grumpy Old Men.' Clint shows us again why he deserved the Irving Thalberg award. He is a true legend in the movie business. This tale presents Eastwood as a crusty, bigoted Korean War veteran whose weathered face hints at a world of horrors he has visited. He grudgingly befriends a Hmong family next door, taking an interest in them after his beloved wife dies. He has no warm fuzzies for most people - even his own family - but slowly develops a deep respect for this immigrant clan, realizing after several incidents in the neighborhood that they embody some of the human traits he holds dear: honor, justice and loyalty. 'Gran Torino' is one of the best movies of 2008 and it's a travesty that it didn't even get a single Oscar nomination. Nevertheless, Clint proved once again that he can hold his own, whether as a 30-year-old gunslinger or a 78-year-old grandpa.",9,1,6,2 July 2009
The World's Fastest Indian," Come along for the ride
","'The World's Fastest Indian' has two main characters: A man and a motorcycle. If Burt Munro - the eccentric New Zealander for whom the movie is about - had been the actor in this saga, I believe he would have insisted that his motorcycle get top billing.One man's improbable, unyielding quest to accomplish his dream is at the heart of this heartwarming film. Burt Munro was a real person and the events of the movie are based on real events (with a few liberties taken). Briefly, the backyard tinkerer living near the bottom of the world set out to set the land speed record with a 45-year-old motorcycle held together by things such as a door hinge and a cork.I, of course, have never met Burt, but watching Anthony Hopkins absorb his life makes me feel that I know him as well as his friends, neighbors and fans across the world did.Hopkins is perfect as the 68-year-old coot who charms his way through life simply by being himself. People are enamored of him; the man seems to be totally without guile.Though some may liken this to a fish-out-of-water tale such as Crocodile Dundee, that is an unfair comparison. Burt is out of his element in the United States, yes, but he is also a bit out of place in his Down Under hometown. He may be an eccentric of sorts, but he is impossible to dislike.I admit: I have a weak spot for uplifting movies about real people doing extraordinary things. And 'Indian' is one of the better ones. If you decide to go along for the ride you won't be disappointed.",8,0,0,4 February 2007
Avatar," Green politics against a green screen
","With 'Avatar' James Cameron practically bludgeons us with his own brand of 'green' political correctness. Let's see ... An advanced race of people invade a serene wilderness in order to subjugate the peaceful natives. No, that doesn't sound anything like the leftist drivel passing for American history today, does it? Politics aside, the movie is breathtaking in its scope, with special effects that are nothing short of miraculous. Viewers are certainly drawn into the world of Pandora. Watching the movie, with its green-screen wonderment, provides a welcome escape from our everyday lives. Unfortunately, this movie fails us in other ways. While I certainly don't share the tree-hugging politics of Cameron and his ilk, I could have appreciated the movie more if he would have at least inserted some nuance into the characters. Instead, we have the stereotypical colonel trampling the forest and mowing down the peaceful aliens while spouting B-movie lines. Oh well, guess you can't have everything, even for $250 million.",6,2,5,19 June 2010
Glory Road," Fair presentation of an inspirational subject
","'Glory Road' tells the true (though as with any such movie, apparently partially fictionalized) story of the Texas Western basketball team's 1966 season as it startled the nation with its march to the national championship. Though it takes place after passage of the Civil Rights Act and during the brotherhood speeches of Martin Luther King Jr., the blatant racism of earlier times lingered more than a little. The film does a good job of providing viewers with a taste of that fact. It is certainly an inspirational story and the cast does as well as can be expected in a movie that necessarily must attempt to explore a number of characters. On the negative side, the game scenes sometimes seemed poorly filmed and some of the dialog - especially the radio and television announcers - was stilted and felt awkward. Still, for those who appreciate a good sports movie, this is worth a look.",7,0,0,29 December 2006
There Will Be Blood," There will be boredom
","'There Will Be Blood' reminded me very much of 'Gangs of New York,' which also featured another scenery-eating performance by Daniel Day-Lewis. The cinematography is lush, the acting deep and the overall feel of the film majestic. But it is ultimately unsatisfying. The movie traces the life of a misanthropic loner who turns the American dream into a nightmare. Day-Lewis refers to himself as an oil man, and that's what he is. He lets nothing get in the way of getting what he wants, though we're never really sure what that is. Money isn't really the goal, as he turned down a deal offered by Standard Oil that would have made him a multi-millionaire. 'What would I do?' he asks as he turns down the deal. No doubt, Day-Lewis is a masterful actor, adept at turning in performances of larger-than-life characters. I was disappointed, however, in the Eli Sunday character, as played by Paul Dano, who was so good in 'Little Miss Sunshine.' It's unfortunate that a movie often praised as being iconoclastic reverts to the tired stereotype of the hypocritical, self-aggrandizing preacher. And, frankly, Dano's performance is somewhat lacking in nuance. The movie meanders over 2 1/2 hours before crashing to a jarring end. 'I am finished,' Day-Lewis's character pronounces. He should have said that about an hour earlier.",6,13,25,16 February 2008
The Blind Side," An overrated feel-good movie with an overrated Oscar
","'The Blind Side' is a decent movie about some decent people who gave a decent young man a chance at life. Unfortunately, that's about as exciting as it gets. As a feel-good movie, it pales in comparison to many other films I would place in the same category. Take 'October Sky' as an example. It has many similarities to 'The Blind Side.' Both are about a teen-ager who has had little encouragement in his life and an adult who sees potential and nurtures it. Both have positive outcomes. And both are based on true stories. But 'October Sky' gave us a much more compelling story and kept us more emotionally involved. The fault may lie partly on the subject matter, but I believe there it more to it than that. I, for one, believe Sandra Bullock's Oscar was one of the least deserved in recent history. I may be no drama expert, like some who are on the message board claim to be, but to me her performance was uninspired. All in all, much of the time while I was watching the movie it seemed like something I'd seen a million times on the Hallmark Hall of Fame channel or a Lifetime movie of the week.",6,0,3,28 March 2010
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," An excellent adventure indeed, dude
","Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure is like a huge breath of fresh air: It tickles, but too much of it and you might get a bit giddy. The movie delivers just enough as the main characters rocket back and forth through history while solidly maintaining their surfer-dude personalities. Of course the movie is silly, but it's silly in an endearing way. The characters are extremely likable - sweet, even. The plot - in which Keanue Reeves and Alex Winter kidnap famous historical figures in order to help them create a totally awesome school report - is pleasantly goofy and laced with a number of clever time-travel loops and turns. In a life of serious problems, you could do worse than spend 100 minutes watching this fun film.",7,0,0,24 October 2006
