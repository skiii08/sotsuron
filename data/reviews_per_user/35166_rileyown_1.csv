Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not as bad as people make it seem....
","I was just like everyone else at first
this movie was at the bottom of my list for Star Wars.
But I've seen the movie so much more sense then and...I think it's a decent film.
This movie has flaws yes, three main one's for me
01. Jar Jar (obviously)
02. Jake Lloyd was GOD AWFUL in this movie
03. way too many politics
but the good parts are really good.
the pod-race is phenomenal, Darth Maul is a #x27; beast in this, Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan are amazing, and as a whole, this movie isn't that bad
now that I've re watched all of the Star Wars movies so many times, I think the new movie at the bottom of the list is
The Last Jedi
So good on you Phantom Menace, you didn't actually suck!",7,4,6,24 December 2019
