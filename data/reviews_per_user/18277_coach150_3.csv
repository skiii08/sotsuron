Hereditary," Chilling, Creeping, Shocking
","Growing up as a young kid I was always fascinated and intrigued by the shocking and the horrific. From a pre-teen era I had developed a key interest in the horror genre. Throughout the years this interest diminished as horror flicks and blood/gore filled movies monopolized this genre. Very few movies managed to achieve the fear and creeping factor that is necessary for a horror movie to be truly what it needs to be, horrific. Hereditary has managed exactly that! You experience a range of emotions that you rarely experience in a modern horror movie. Many say that the movie is the new modern Exorcist, but I believe that it has more of a 60's feel to it resembling old horror-mysteries such Rosemary's Baby. Moving on to the direction, sound score, sound editing and acting you find yourself encapsulated in a a near-perfect horror picture. Finally you cannot review this movie without praising the Toni Collette's amazing performance in the lead role of Annie Graham. She gave life, fear and anger in her character that really captures your breadth and blows you away. A modern model of a horror feature film",8,7,12,6 September 2018
Prisoners," Best Crime-Thriller of the year?
","Amazing!! Probably the best thriller of the year!! Prisoners is a movie that brings up the tension throughout the whole running time of 153 minutes! There is suspense for the entire length of the film, followed by a great cast, performing fantastically. Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal have made this feature outstanding! Denis Villeneuve has made yet an other excellent motion picture such as 'Incendies'! This movie is not an easy going story, its thrill seeking, tension rising, a bit disturbing, but at the same time an excellent cinematic feature! I recommend this movie to all, but keep in mind its not for the faint hearted!For sure it will make an impact for 2014s Oscars",9,2,4,18 November 2013
Whiplash," Not a good job, an Amazing job!
","I watched this movie just because it was an Oscar nominated movie that i had to watch prior to February 22. I was so wrong. This movie was wonderful, it was thrilling, exciting and inspiring. To be blunt i did not have any expectations coming in and watching this movie. Did not know much about director Damien Chazelle, with the exception that he made the screenplay for Last Exorcism Part II. Therefore it is evident that i was not expecting much, but i needed to know what all the fuzz was about. The fuzz is real, trust me Chazelle did a fantastic job with this film.Everything is spot on, casting, directing cinematography, music, acting. First of all, Miles Teller was a huge surprise. A young actor that fitted perfectly in his role and actually made it his own. His performance was outstanding, i could actually feel the struggle that he was going through. I did not see this coming from Miles in Project X, even though he performed fairly in the Spectacular Now. Now i expect great things from this actor and he has a bright road up ahead. J.K. Simmons acting was fantastic, he outdone himself. He had me in a roller coaster of hate and understanding for his character actions and behavior. He gave his character a vast depth. Both of them did an exceptionally good display of acting and their talent mesmerized me in this beautiful movie. I recommend this to all movie goers as well as music enthusiasts to watch and enjoy this powerful film, full of emotions and struggle to achieve much more than a 'good job'",10,1,2,19 January 2015
