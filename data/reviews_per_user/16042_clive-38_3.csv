Casablanca," Triple Oscar winning classic movie with all star cast and a memorable collection of quotable lines
","'Casablanca' featured one of those all star casts that only come along once in a lifetime - Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, Paul Henreid, Claude Rains, Conrad Veidt, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, S. Z. Sakall, Dan Seymour, Marcel Dalio and Dooley Wilson. (The first choice of leading players was to have been Ronald Reagan, Ann Sheridan and Dennis Morgan but if this proposed casting had gone ahead I very much doubt if the film would have received the cult following it has today!). 'Casablanca' won Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director (Michael Curtiz) and Best Screenplay (Julius and Philip Epstein). It also had nominations for Best Actor (Bogart), Best Supporting Actor (Claude Rains), Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing and Best Score.Surely almost everyone has seen this film and everybody knows the plot which is set during World War 2 at a night club owned by American Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) in Casablanca frequented by many dubious characters of all nationalities when just to complicate matters in walks Ilsa Lund Laszio (Ingrid Bergman) his ex-lover from years before who had abandoned him. She is now married to resistance leader Victor Laszio (Paul Henreid) on the run from the Germans. Bogart can help by supplying them with the vital transit papers they desperately need to escape to America but is he willing to do that when his policy has always been: 'I stick my neck out for nobody'? In addition he still holds strong feelings for Bergman so will this influence his decision?One of the great Warner Bros. films of the forties - possibly the most productive decade in the history of Hollywood .... and how about all those 'classic lines'? It is very unlikely that any other movie produced as many quotable lines as did 'Casablanca'. Here are just a few of those legendary lines I still remember to this day:Bogart: 'Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine'.Bergman: 'Play it Sam. Play 'As Time Goes By'.'Bogart: 'You played it for her, you can play it for me .... if she can stand it, I can. Play it'.Bogart: 'Here's looking at you kid'.Bogart: 'The problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world'.Rains: 'Round up the usual suspects'.Bogart: 'Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship'.'Casablanca' is worth seeing over and over again just to hear Bogart uttering those unforgettable lines in his inimitable style. And of course that celebrated song by Dooley Wilson - 'As Time Goes By'.   10/10.  Clive Roberts.",8,0,0,18 December 2000
The Caine Mutiny," Another powerful performance by Bogart with top supporting cast
","'The Caine Mutiny' features one of Bogart's most powerful roles - he was brilliant as the paranoid Captain Queeg and in my opinion should have won the Best Actor Oscar for this part. He was nominated for the award but was beaten by Marlon Brando in 'On the Waterfront' which was of course another great performance so it was difficult for the Academy voters to choose. 'The Caine Mutiny' was nominated that year for six Oscars but did not pick up one! Also nominated for Best Actor were Bing Crosby for 'The Country Girl', James Mason ('A Star Is Born') and Dan O'Herlihy ('The Adventures of Robinson Crusoe').  The film had an outstanding cast including Fred MacMurray, Jose Ferrer, Van Johnson, E. G. Marshall, Lee Marvin, Tom Tulley and Claude Atkins. A gripping storyline (from the novel and play by Herman Wouk), top drawer acting, beautifully photographed in Technicolor and produced by Stanley Kramer. The weak part of the film was the totally unnecessary love story between Robert Francis and May Wynn (I wonder whatever happened to them?). This slowed down the whole film (which ran for over two hours) and it would have greatly improved and tightened up the story by cutting out this romance which was extraneous to the plot anyway.  Director Edward Dmytryk did a magnificent job handling the impressive cast and particularly in the courtroom scenes when Captain Queeg (Bogart) is on the stand: 'Ah .. but the strawberries, that's where I had them. They laughed at me and made jokes but I proved beyond the shadow of a doubt and with geometric logic that a duplicate key to the wardroom icebox did exist ... ' What a cast! What a film!  And in common with most of Bogart's films this is worth repeated viewings. 10/10. Clive Roberts.",10,1,3,11 November 2000
North by Northwest," A magnificent Hitchcock thriller with impressive set pieces and strong cast
","Director Alfred Hitchcock made many first rate films during his long career both in England and in Hollywood and with 'North by Northwest' reached the top of his form with an original story written specially for the screen by Ernest Lehman and a perfect cast including several Hitchcock regulars.  The dramatic music by Bernard Herrmann greatly added to my overall enjoyment of the film.  This is a fast moving witty thriller in magnificent Technicolor with Cary Grant as Roger O. Thornhill giving the performance of a lifetime. Grant is mistaken for government agent George Kaplan and is thrust into one life threatening situation after another on the run from both the police and the bad guys! It's a roller coaster ride of thrills, suspense, comedy and romance skilfully put together with the expert Hitchcock touch. There are some spectacular set pieces in unusual locations such as the United Nations Building, New York's Grand Central Station, Mount Rushmore and who can forget the famous crop dusting sequence at Prairie Stop on deserted Highway 41.  Cary Grant wears the same suit throughout the film but stil manages to look as elegant as ever despite the many tricky and dangerous situations he finds himself in!  James Mason has never been better as the sinister Phillip Vandamm intent on eliminating Cary with the help of his two menacing associates Adam Williams and Robert Ellestein who played their villainous parts very convincingly. Eva Marie Saint was the usual Hitchcock ice cool blonde heroine while Jessie Royce Landis was excellent as Cary Grant's mother although in reality she was only a few months older than Grant! (They were both born in 1904). This actress was also with Cary Grant in another Hitchcock film 'to Catch a Thief' in which she played Grace Kelly's mother. Martin Landau was impressive in his first screen role as the vicious Leonard trying to get rid of Cary at every opportunity! Veteran actor Leo G. Carroll was making his sixth appearance in a Hitchcock film as the CIA/FBI Agent known only as the 'Professor'. One of my favourite actresses Doreen Lang had the small part of Grant's secretary Maggie and can also be seen in other Hitchcock films such as 'The Wrong Man' and 'The Birds'. Surprisingly, 'North by Northwest' did not win any Oscars and Hitchcock, Cary Grant and the film itself were not even nominated which in retrospect was a regrettable oversight. It was unfortunate that this was the year when 'Ben Hur' scooped the awards and won an amazing total of 11 Oscars. The films nominated for Best Picture that year were 'Ben Hur' (the winner), 'Anatomy of a Murder', 'Diary of Anne Frank', 'The Nun's Story' and 'Room at the Top'.  Looking at these titles today it is unbelievable to me that 'North by Northwest' could not have been included in the nominations.  The best actor Oscar went to Charlton Heston for 'Ben Hur' and the other nominees were Laurence Harvey ('Room at the Top'), Jack Lemmon ('Some Like It Hot'), Paul Muni ('The Last Angry Man'), and James Stewart ('Anatomy of a Murder'). Ernest Lehman's Oscar nominated story and screenplay was full of gems including Jessie Royce Landis asking the would-be assassins: 'You gentlemen aren't really trying to kill my son are you?'. And Grant to Leo G. Carroll: 'I'm an advertising man, not a red herring! I've got a job, a secretary, a mother, two ex wives and several bartenders dependent upon me and I don't intend to disappoint them all by getting myself slightly killed!'.  A Hitchcock masterpiece. 10/10.  Not to be missed. Clive Roberts.",10,0,0,10 November 2000
