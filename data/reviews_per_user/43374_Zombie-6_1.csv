The Blair Witch Project," Take that Hollywood!
","For all that glitters in Hollywood, a little gem sparkles amongst the diamonds. This movie or shall we call it 'mock-umentary' has all the tools to make anyone stir in their seat.  While I was watching it, I couldn't help but ask myself, 'what if it was me?' This format may not appeal to all, but a change such as this is quite welcome. I will see it again. Scary great time.",9,1,2,10 August 1999
