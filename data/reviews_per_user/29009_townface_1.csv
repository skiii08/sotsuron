The Ring," not bad.
","Being a big fan of the original trilogy( and it is a trilogy regardless of what some people say(colin)) i watched the re-make with a certain degree of caution.  On the whole it was pretty successful.  It was well acted and directed with a few good jumps but the film does have its faults.  In my opinion it had a tendancy to rely on the jump shock with a loud noise rather than just let us get involved in the atmosphere.  The horse sub-plot was a disaster and pointless.  The child was just a left over from the sixth sense and not just a normal child as he was in the original.  It also tried to answer too many questions.  What is it with american films?  Why do they have to try to explain everything?  I don't need to be told all the answers. It's nice to be able to think for yourself.  Maybe thats part of being a european film goer and not an american.  We don't all want to go home with a smile on our faces.As i said earlier tho', it's not a bad film and could have been a lot worse.One final comment though.  For all the people who have written into the thread at the bottom - JUST WATCH THE ORIGINAL TRILOGY AND ALL YOUR QUESTIONS WILL BE ANSWERED.  DON'T BE PUT OFF BECAUSE IT'S GOT SUBTITLES.",Null,0,1,22 March 2003
