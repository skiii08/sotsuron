The New World," Great film.
","I rented this film this past weekend without any real expectations. I was amazed to enjoy this movie as much as I did, it's probably one of my ten favorites now. However, I will advise anyone who reads this, this movie is not for everyone. The cinematography in this movie was amazing, and I was even more surprised that it was filmed in my backyard, Virginia. I felt the acting was great, especially on the part of those who played the native Americans. A good word to describe this film would be artistic, much of the voice-over dialogue was incredibly poetic. Much of the movie seemed to be an extended montage, which is something I enjoy. So if you want to dive heavy into plot, be involved in a large cast, and be riveted by extended fight scenes, this is not your movie. If you like a great love story, amazing cinematography and great soundtrack, this is just the movie for you.",10,2,5,3 July 2006
