Requiem for a Dream," Beautiful, disturbing, highly visual.
","Requiem is a beautiful movie that you will have to dislike to appreciate. Highly confrontational, Darren Aronofsky's masterpiece brings the drug 'epidemic' to a level that Steven Soderbergh's 'Traffic' could not reach. This film is both visually and aurally appealing; Darren Aronofsky's direction and Clint Mansell's score provide a sympathetic realism that is much more frightening than any horror movie. Overall, Requiem For A Dream is cast , directed, acted, shot and written brilliantly, but I would be hesitant to recommend it to anyone with a weak stomach.  Darren Aronofsky is definitely a director to look out for, and it is highly possible that he rescues the somewhat dull Batman franchise.",9,0,0,3 April 2001
Snatch," Visually hyperactive, wonderful
","Being one of the legion of fans of Lock Stock & Two Smoking Barrels, I obviously had quite an expectation for Guy Ritchie's second film, Snatch. Having read reviews for Snatch prior to seeing it, I expected to see Lock Stock version two.  However, I was very pleasantly surprised to see that this was not the case. Snatch is a brilliant standalone film that is visually amazing from start to finish.  Sometimes the case is with visually spectacular films that the characters/story lines aren't developed properly, but Guy Ritchie is just as good at dialogue as he is a director.  In a way Snatch improves on Lock Stock's only flaw - the acting.  Lock Stock was restrained financially, so they were forced to use second-rate actors with very little to no experience.  Snatch applies the familiarity and experience of actors such as Brad Pitt, Oscar winner Benicio Del Toro and Dennis Farina. Snatch is a visual and aural feast (Ritchie loves fast-paced music to match the action), and is well worth your while to view it. Snatch: 9/10",Null,0,0,30 April 2001
