The Double Life of VÃ©ronique," Within the mystery of life...
","This movie is my favorite movie of all time.  It encompasses all that I believe in life.  The unseen, the dreamy, the beauty, the power of believing and the 'lightness of being'.  The imagery is both stunningly beautiful and inventing.  The story line is amazing and takes you under its wings to carry you far beyond in places you only dreamt existed.  Kievlowski is in my opinion one of the best directors of all time.  He has helped the cinema by giving it his 'ballade', full of feelings and tender  emotions.  The casting and acting is top-notch.  Also unforgetable is Irene Jacob's performance. She carries the film on her shoulders with near-perfect beauty and grace. I only say 'near-perfect' as a compliment, just like the movie is near-perfect as it knows to leave space for life to be and blossom.  For anyone who hasn't seen it yet, let yourself go and believe...",Null,5,8,15 October 1999
