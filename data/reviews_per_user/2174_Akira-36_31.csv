Blade Runner 2049," A sumptuous sequel to Blade Runner that is in love with its own aesthetics but missing the soulfulness of its predecessor
","I guess my expectation was a little too high for Blade Runner 2049. I enjoyed Sicario and Arrival, and was excited to see what director Denis Villeneuve would bring to the classic sci-fi world of Blade Runner.My expectation was further built up after watching the three excellent short stories that the studio released on YouTube. They were wonderful short-films themselves. The narrative, the mood and the acting of the three shorts were nothing short of astounding.Now I'd like to point out that Blade Runner 2049 is a really well made film. You can feel the passion and respect of the film crew and cast in revisiting the dystopian world first written by Philip K. Dick decades ago.That story has been further expanded with intriguing new characters, both humans and replicants. However, at 47 minutes longer than the original movie, the film felt protracted. It seems Villeneuve is in love with his own storytelling as there were too many lingering shots over barren landscapes, the horse sculpture scenes and conversational points that felt somehow hollow. Although the visual aesthetics is gorgeous and the production design is top notch, I feel that 2049 couldn't decide if it wants to be Blade Runner 2.0, or Ghost in the Shell. The first is an existential study of identity and memory wrapped in neo-noir detective story in a dystopian retro-future. While the latter is an existential study of soul/consciousness wrapped in an action hi-tech thriller.Maybe Villeneuve or the screenwriters wanted 2049 to be both. Certainly, there are more and frenetic action sequences in this movie that for me, feels jarring when juxtaposed with the slow and contemplative sequences that almost drown the narrative flow of the second arc.It didn't help that the soundtrack was heavily post-industrious with mechanical clanking screeching over nostalgic synthesizer of the original's. While, the overall cityscape and gears in 2049 are kept retro-futurist looking, this sequel has lost the neo-noir feel of the original. Contemplative scenes and longing gazes of the original are replaced by emotionless look and disconnection between the characters.While the sense of mystery kept me engaged in the first half of the movie, the slow burn sequences in the middle and last part of the movie didn't really build up enough tension nor immersion in the story. So when the revelations of beloved characters showed up, they didn't feel so much as rewards but empty shells of their former selves.I agree that both Ryan Gosling and Ana de Armas are beautiful to look at, but there is something mundane about them that kept pulling me out of the futuristic world. Perhaps someone like Armie Hammer would have been a better choice than Gosling. There is also very little chemistry from K towards Joi, and I'm not sure if it was written to be that way. Because K's interaction with almost all the characters in the movie were cold and disconnected as well. He posed and fought well throughout the movie, but when it comes to the investigative or character building portion, he didn't feel natural.I guess I found Detective K's character too stoic to sympathize with. More at home with his digital girlfriend than with humans, this blade runner does not exude enough emotion for me to understand his anguish outburst at the memories facility, neither did he hint at any stirring emotions that would make his character arc felt satisfying.In the end Roy's tears in the rain was more poignant than K's tears in the snowfall. If Blade Runner was haunting and dark, 2049 is tragic and sleek. I do enjoy the plot twists and revelations, but wish they had substituted some (but not all) of the lingering shots with more character building, especially building up Bautista's Sapper and Leto's Wallace characters. I appreciate the nods to the original movies with a slightly updated Spinner design and cameos from both Gaff and Rachael.In the end though, I'm glad they made this movie with such fervour and respect to its predecessor and to the original fans. It's just a pity that 2049 in my opinion lacks heart and soul of the original's. Who knows, perhaps like the original, I'll come to appreciate 2049 upon second or third viewing. Perhaps this movie is truly ahead of its time, much like Ridley Scott's Blade Runner.One thing for sure, Blade Runner 2049 deserved to be experienced on the big screen. And it's a leap above Rupert Sanders' Ghost in the Shell.",7,3,9,21 October 2017
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," 10 good and bad things about this movie
","I've watched the movie & the original trilogy, read the books & comics, collect the figures & so on. I'm a fan. But I have a mixed feelings and opinion regarding Episode 1, which best described by these points.10 GOOD THINGS : 1. Great effects. Lucas has managed to paint the StarWars worlds closer to his imagination with ILM technology. The Naboo palaces are elegant, beautiful Gungan city, hi-tech Coruscant and well-designed Battle Droids.2. Professional actors and actresses. It's amazing to see some of the heavy-caliber actors/actresses and hot newcomers casted in the movie. Ewan is a perfect substitution for Alec Guinness, Liam has the charisma and posture meant for a Qui-Gon, Natalie's characterization has strength plus she has this intellect and sweetness in her image, etc.3. Loyalty to the original trilogy. You can finally see how the Jedi (and the rest of the galaxy) are (were) like before the Empire rules. They are more liveful, energetic and colorful. All this without the expense of the Jedi tradition. You can see how the designs of settings, costumes and vehicles (although they seem to be more advance) will later contribute to the designs in the original trilogy.4. I welcome the cameo appearance of some of the original cast. A. Daniels as 3PO, K. Baker as R2, Ian McDarmid's Palpatine, even Warwick Davis is there.5. Great costumes. The Jedi cape has distinctive personality according to the one who wears it, without eliminating the uniformity of which is clearly Alec Guinness' OB1's costume. Amidala's costumes are meticulously designed with much Japanese influence.6. Spectacular lightsaber fighting scenes. On the desert, in the hangar and the last one. Specially the last one. I think Lucas and his team want the best battle choreography done as the climax. When American audience has been exposed to fast-paced Asian action movies (Hongkong and Japanese anime), they have to increase the standard of this fighting scene to cope with the audience demands. And they did.7. Not all things are explained which make me impatient to wait for the next episode. Lots of loose ends need to be tied here. Hopefully they are meant to be that way and not because of some fault in the narration.8. Lots of 'delights' planted in the movie. Some for fun, while others I believe actually connected to the rest of the episodes. Try to find out, there are at least 6 'secrets' in the movie.9. A complete family set. You have QuiGon to represent the old generation/the mentor, OB1 to present the young adult, and young Anakin for the kids to relate to.10. John Williams is back as the composer for the soundtrack. My personal fav. is the last lightsaber-fight's background music. Nice job there Mr. Williams.And now the 10 BAD things about this movie which, surprisingly spoken not by the press or non sci-fi fan, but myself and other long-time Starwars fans :1. Jar Jar Binks & Boss Nass. If Lucas needed to introduce the element of comedy, he should've done it through intelligent comical dialogue (just like what he did with Luke, Han and Leia), not some low grade physical slapsticks (I hate the way JarJar jumps into the water).2. Target audience. Obviously Lucas directed this movie towards the 6 to 13 year old kids instead of his true long-time fans, who are mostly aged 20 to 40 by now. Perhaps this is also because of the fact of him being a father. We all can use the humour, but to what level exactly? The children seem to be the ones truly enjoying the entire movie.3. Plot is too shallow. The media say,'So are the rest of the episodes' plots.' No. The original trilogy were conceived through careful and detailed narration. This was done by having the right chemistry between the characters and the dialogue are meaningful and entertaining. Unfortunately I can't say the same thing for TPM.4. In connection with opinion #3, the entire movie seems like a series of pacthes of many beautiful and strong scenes. Perhaps the movie is too short, that we are not given enough time to know what is really going on. Or because it's really too simple while we're still thinking if that action really means something.5. The effects and climaxes overwhelm the characterizations. Too many good things fighting each other. The CG creatures are too perfect, too smooth that you know how fake they are. When the Ewoks die in ROJ, I actually feel sorry for those 'little teddy bears' but in TPM I don't care much what happens to those 'overgrown ducks'.6. Racism in context of personalization. I know Lucas is merely trying to entertain the kids but isn't he mentally suggesting to the kids, how silly the Jamaican Jar Jar Binks is, how simple-minded the Italian Boss Nass is, how evil the Japanese Viceroys are, and how greedy the-whatever-non-American-Watto is?7. Anakin is too young. The original script was meant to have a 10 year old Anakin, but the genius Lucas thinks it would be more touching to have an 8 year old  to go through all the obstacles. Well, because of this there are odd moments when Anakin interacts which other characters, especially the sexual implication between him and Amidala/Padme.8. I dislike how Anakin destroys the Droid Control Ship. It looks more like luck than the force. Oops, push this button (there goes the power generator), push this button (the battle (droids are destroyed).9. The movie seems like a lab-rat to test ILM's new technology. The CG characters truly lack of emotion. The mimics are all there but not the emotions, not the souls. Lucas is better go back to actors wearing costumes and masks.10. The chemistry between the characters (except for QuiGon and OB1) is lost in the midst of all the excitements.I can only hope all of our disappointments and opinions do not fall on deaf ears, and that Lucas may have the remedy in the next chapters. So next time, I will be able to write 20 good things about Episode II with 0 bad things.Thank you.",5,0,1,17 July 1999
Star Trek," What a joyride from beginning to end!
","What a joyride from beginning to end! I'm not a Trekkie, although I did enjoy TNG a lot as a teenager. But the old classic Star Trek was too cheesy and the only reason I watched some of the episodes were to laugh at the silliness of it all. It was so silly that it became entertaining.However, this newest movie tops it all. It is simply the best of out the whole movie series, and I believe it will win many new converts. J.J. Abrams earned my respect yet again. The movie thrills and entertains you, while remaining respectful and thoughtful to its predecessors. Even the cheesy sound effects from the classic series were intact, yet somehow crisper and nicer on the ears.I love the new interpretations of the characters and think that at their very cores, they remain the same souls. The twists with the character relationship and plot were also well done. The action sequences and CGI were absolutely spectacular.I hope they keep J.J. Abrams for the sequels, and now wonder if he should have been involved with reviving G.I. Joe: Rise of Cobra.",9,0,7,6 June 2009
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Rogue One stands out as the rogue in the family
","SPOILERS AT YOUR 12 I give this movie 7.5 out of 10. It wins points for its freshness, introducing new elements to the Star Wars universe like new types of Stormtroopers and new vehicles, whilst teasing your nostalgic sensibilities. Classic characters from the original trilogy and prequels make cameos that build connections to both trilogies and the animated series. Even Aunt Beru's blue milk made an appearance.I was personally delighted to see both Gold and Red Leaders from Episode IV and even a couple of familiar Cantina's thugs. The action pieces and production design are of high caliber - at once they fit within the Star Wars universe gritty and used looks, and at the same time they help heighten the war zone feel of the movie.Like all the Star Wars movies, Rogue One takes its inspirations from classics like The Dirty Dozens and Saving Private Ryan. We have heard the story before, things are familiar and yet within the context of Star Wars - they feel bold and brave. Kudos to all the film crew and cast for pushing the envelope and stay close to the director's vision, despite I heard Disney's attempt at making it child-friendly.And this is where the movie starts to lose points: although the narrative is solid and the story flow doesn't feel 'Forced', it is uneven at places. Especially every time they threw a joke in what should have been a somber or a tensed sequence. There are too many times this happens that I never feel truly immersed in the world. The jokes, admittedly funny, were too frequent and peppered throughout the movie that they diminish the weight of the situation and all the sacrifices that climax with the death of all the main characters.Additionally, many of the powerful shots and sequences from the second trailer are not in the movie. I would have loved to see that rebel soldier running towards the AT-AT.At times, it also felt they put in too many references to the original movies that Rogue One never quite spread its wings and be a truly independent vision from all its predecessors.However, I am sill happy with the overall movie. It is better paced and told compared to Episode VII. It's got my childhood hero Donnie Yen and all the other cast and characters brought gravitas and quality to their performances. Unlike the cast of Episode VII who at times felt like they were so giddy to be in Star Wars and were there simply to stitch the set pieces together. In Rogue One, each character feels they belong with the story line.Lastly, for a couple of minutes the end sequence made me feel like a boy again: I was five or six watching Episode IV for the first time on TV, terrorized by Darth Vader as he invaded Tantive V and walks through that smoky hallway amongst dead rebel soldiers. For those two glorious minutes I thank Gareth Edwards for finally delivering a Star Wars film worthy of the classic trilogy. Rogue One never reaches the height of the original trilogy, but it is certainly a bold and fresh take on the Star Wars legacy that more than makes up for last year's recycled sequel from J.J. Abrams.",7,25,50,16 December 2016
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Entertaining.
","Yep, that's pretty much sum it up. This is an entertaining summer movie. A thumb up for Verbinski and/or the film editor that decided to keep the running time more than 2 hours. It allowed for character development and interaction. Quite engaging at times and the cgi usage was effective and precise.Plus you have gorgeous casts and big budget. Everyone had fun.",7,0,1,22 October 2003
Us," A bland horror and let down from the highly entertaining Get Out
","I really like Get Out, but found Us to be bland and uninspired. No intriguing subtext nor social commentary, and no humor in it too. I think Lupita acted well but I couldn't be absorbed into the movie, there seems to be an aloofness to it all. And I never really went through the journey with any of the characters, unlike Get Out. A shame really as it could have gone somewhere incredible or twisted. Speaking of the twist, it was predictable from about a quarter through the movie.The problem is that US recycles a number of older horror movies which did each of the theme better: Invasion of the Body Snatcher, Logan's Run and The One I Love came to mind.The opening text was misleading too, I thought it was alluding to some sort of subterranean mutant world or a supernatural dimension. The film is a bit of a mess, although the actors gave pretty solid performance. It's just they are not that well written nor interesting for me to sympathize with. None of them are.Jordan Peele needed to cook this one a bit longer.",5,1,1,10 June 2019
Terminator Salvation," This latest installment has more dust and metals, then bones and dread.
","Terminator Salvation is a league of its own, in fact it feels like a movie that belongs to a different series. Despite it's cyberpunk legacy, Terminator Salvation feels like a war drama that happens to be set in a sci-fi post-apocalyptic future. Gone are the dark sky with red and blue rays penetrating the smoky horizon. This latest installment has more dust and metals, then bones and dread.I think that's what missing from this movie: a sense of dread. Every time I watched the flash forwards from the original trilogy, they always had a grim sense of nihilistic dread. Even the comics of the 80's and 90's retain that sense of hopelessness and impending doom.Terminator Salvation however took a different turn, and in most part it worked. The action, visual effects and plot were engaging. They may not be the best, but it's definitely worth watching the movie in the cinema. McG seems to have a more mature film direction, and the re-polished script certainly helped gelled the characters more. I was wholly entertained and it was fun to watch several references to the previous trilogy, especially a delightful sort of a cameo by an 'original cast'.I think the main problem of the movie is the lack of running time. It seems the movie would do better with more character developments, but unfortunately the action sequences were competing too hard for screen time. Otherwise, I would love to learn more about characters like Marcus, Blair, and Kate Brewster. Even John Connor himself didn't get enough screen time, except for yet more action scenes.This is where the original trilogy shone, we got to know the characters well so it felt like we were walking the distance along with them. Whereas with T4, I felt that we were mostly just spectators.Christian Bale and Sam Worthington have done a good job though, and I hope the sequels will be even better. One thing to note: the sub-plot with Marcus's character is inspired by a story arc by Dark Horse's Terminator comics published in the 90's.",5,5,8,6 June 2009
Silent Hill," A unique existential horror that suffers under Hollywood production
","The Silent Hill game series is a rare gem in the survival-horror genre. It blends a rich tapestry of psychology, symbolism, history,pop culture, as well as ancient mysticism. Konami did an incredible job developing a game that is immensely engaging, eerie and disturbing. The movie version is visually as stunning as the game, but it lacks soul, empathy and coherence. Christophe Gans has gone to great lengths in securing the right to this movie. I've read that he played the console games, and personally wrote a letter to Konami expressing his understanding and respect for the game. However, from the look of things he has not successfully translated the essence of the game, and instead went into a tangent to tell a rather different story. In any other instances, I would have welcomed a new twist, different interpretations or additions to the game's lore. However, by turning the very core of the story upside down this has become a disappointing adaptation of an otherwise beautifully shot film.SPOILERSHere are the differences between the movie and the console games: 1. The main the protagonist is now a woman. The father figure who is desperately searching for his daughter (in the game) has been supplanted by a mother figure. Hollywood is once again conforming to the popular stereotype of the absent father who is unable to protect the wife/daughter character from harm. Subconsciously, the terrors of Silent Hill can also be interpreted as the representation of malevolent presence or the incompetence of the male characters. This change of gender also helps to support the underlying message of the film. This is clearly stated at least twice in the movie when the character of Cybil Bennett and Rose Da Silva mention that 'Mother is god in the eyes of a child.' The fertility-goddess subtext is indeed inherent in some parts of the movie.2. The Satanic cult in the first game is led by Dahlia Gillespie. She also raised Alessa Gillespie to bear the seed of Samael. The burning that Alessa sustained was a ritual that had gone awry, or as some game fans have suggested was intentionally done to create undying hatred within the child Alessa: a prerequisite condition for the unholy birth.Throughout the original game and its sequels, the Satanic cult continues to thwart our heroes/heroines. It represents the twisted and evil part of humanity. The cult membership comprises of nurses, doctors, a geneticist and other lay people. They even produce and distribute addictive drugs to control/influence the town's population.In the movie however, the cult has been changed into a witch-hunting pseudo-Christian church. This is the biggest and most damaging alteration in the film, which changes the core story of the game. In the movie, now we have an evil church versus an evil child, complemented by agnostic/atheist protagonists.3. The unholy trinity of Samael, Alessa and Sharon. Due to the failed ritual in the first game, Alessa's body has become so badly burnt that she couldn't function like a normal human anymore. Only the evil presence within her keeps her from death. It is this same power that taps into the mystical force of Silent Hill, and converts its environment into a nightmarish Silent Hill, which is essentially a projection of Alessa's own suffering.Dahlia reverted to alchemy and genetic engineering to clone Alessa's DNA and creates a doppelganger baby. This baby is later saved by a nurse and adopted by the Masons (Da Silvas) and named Cheryl (Sharon). The movie is a bit clumsy in describing how Sharon became adopted. And it is even more ambiguous in describing how the 'Darkness' appeared and 'possessed' Alessa.4. The monsters have lost their symbolic meanings. Every single monster type in Silent Hill game series embodies a psychological trait of a character. The mannequin nurses symbolize James Sutherland's suppressed lust. The theme of the second game is guilt, and thus Pyramid Head is at once the representation of guilt and also the executioner of James's sin (of killing his wife). In the predominantly female cast of the film, many of these monsters have lost their symbolic meanings and relevance to the main characters. In the games, Alessa's dark power feeds on the game characters and makes flesh that which is buried within.5. The omission of the talisman of Metatron and the foghorn of Samael. These are two tools that have been omitted because they don't serve much purpose in the non-interactive medium of film. In the game however, they are physical representations of the two opposing forces of good and evil. The foghorn of Samael is translated into the church's siren in the movie though. Its purpose is slightly different to that of the game's.6. Inconsistent and improper use of music tracks. Akira Yamaoka composed four incredible soundtracks for the four games. Each soundtrack is catered to a specific chapter within the Silent Hill saga. The music pieces help convey emotions and mental states of the characters. They immerse a player into the right mood and help build an eerie atmosphere that is at once disturbing yet attractive. The movie makes use of at least the first three soundtracks extensively. They are selected and scattered throughout the movie almost without any coherence to the progression of the story, nor any significance to the characters' development. I do enjoy the visual of the movie and to be honest, Pyramid Head and Cybil Bennett are really well done in the movie. So if you consider the movie as a separate and unrelated entertainment piece, then you will enjoy this movie as you are treated to an rare existential horror with amazing cinematography and visual effects.",9,5,9,1 October 2006
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," It's Getting Better Folks!
","After I had been disappointed by Episode 1, I decided to watch Episode 2 with less expectations and it paid off. I went into the cinema, preparing myself for another kiddie sci-fi comedy and this film delivered. It was largely comical and better than its predecessor in many aspects: digital/special effects were more real, better characterization, more drama, lots of limbs-flying fights and we got to see Jedi Knights in battle, lots of them.SPOILERSThere were more chemistry between the characters and in this aspect, Lucas seemed to have taken notes that many true fans were largely disappointed with several elements in Episode 1. So scenes involving JJ Binks and Watto were short. In fact Jar Jar was relatively quiet when he did appear. Anakin on the other hand, remained as annoying and arrogant as he ever was. Christensen gave this teenage Anakin an evil edge and throughout the movie, he was more of the local-bar jerk than a promising Jedi knight. He's far from that prophesied Jedi who would bring balance to the Force, whatever that means (won't he fall to the dark side anyway?).Jimmy Smits made a nice cameo as Senator Bail Organa, Leia's future adopting father. Temuera Morrison made an interesting John Waynesque' Jango Fett, with references to classic Western movies. As you probably know that New Zealanders played all the character of Jango Fett, Boba Fett and Captain Typho, so whenever they appeared on screen, the audience here were laughing and cheering at their opportunity to be in Star Wars, and mostly for their kiwi accent.C3PO and R2-D2 (the real heroes of the saga) started their dynamic relationship here, with plenty of fun and laughs. Well, what can I say about Natalie Portman, she's as beautiful and intelligent as ever, and Lucas made sure the movie exploited her sexuality further (a titillation for those 12-13 years old hormones). She changed her costumes so many times that it was getting a bit ridiculous though and old Lucas was probably planning to cash in through her many toys later on. The two last costumes she wore were so sexy and exposing her 'assets' that some audience couldn't resist to say: 'Oooooh! Aaaaah!' and `Rrrrrrrr.'.The romance between Amidala and Anakin was the cheesiest scenes in Star Wars saga unfortunately. The Sound of Music' part was the funniest of all. I understand that this movie was the only chance Lucas had to emphasize on their relationship and doomed romance, but he could've done it in a way that their scenes had been sweet not cheesy. The most surprising part of their supposedly romantic escapade was Anakin having a wet dream about Padme, and when he was found out, he lied and said that he dreamt about his mother. What was Lucas thinking?The dark part of the film had something to do with Anakin, his mother and the Tusken warriors. The revelation of what Anakin did to them had a notorious echo of his falling to the dark side. Other than that, Episode 2 is only darker than Episode 1, simply because there were more shots in night time Coruscant, rainy Kemino and the red-fiery landscape of Genosia.I always believe that puppet/costumed animation is better than digital, but with Episode 2 Lucas had taken it to a higher level. So all the vehicles, droids, aliens, etc. were more real and especially the Coruscant cityscape (which was a reminiscent of Blade Runner).In terms of plot, Lucas was running out of idea so he borrowed a lot from The Empire Strikes Back, among other classic movies. So expect to see vehicle-chasing scenes right at the beginning of the movie, Anakin got his right hand chopped-off and went to sleep, and lastly the last scene of Episode 2 was a complete take on Episode 5's own scene.Christopher Lee was charismatic as the separatist leader and I was amazed at how well he fought with a light sabre (considering his age). His sultry voice and commanding presence was one of the uplifting elements in the film. The best part of the movie, which I believe will be the most memorable scenes from Episode 2, is a fight between Count Dooku and Master Yoda. Simply put, Yoda kicks ass.There were several plot holes and narration problems that caused the story to develop incongruently, however again, the overall script was better written this time. The background music was also something new and added a different feel to Episode 2, almost Middle-Eastern in tone.So my conclusion is that Attack of the Clones' is a much better film compared to The Phantom Menace'. It may still not worthy of the Star Wars heritage because it is simply a different movie that raised more questions and mystery than answers to Episode 1's plot holes, but overall it is genuinely entertaining, funny and better made. It's a heart-lifting comedy of galactic proportion.Still a Star Wars fan, R.",6,0,0,17 May 2002
The Bourne Ultimatum," Smart and fast-paced.
","The Bourne movies always deliver and they get better each time. This third installment is even better than its predecessor on many levels. The action sequences are spectacular, the drama and storyline are well presented and the characterisation is quality writing and top notch performances.The only downside of this movie, as I would've given it a 9/10, is the decision by Greengrass to shoot the film on a very shaky hand-held camera style. The actions and settings of this movie are already well planned and executed. The shaky camera trick however reduces the coherence and clarity of these scenes. It does add a feeling of disorientation and rush to the whole movie, perhaps much like what Jason Bourne himself would be feeling throughout the ordeals.However, it defeats the purpose of planning and executing such brilliant action and drama sequences. You can hardly follow what is going on, as the camera jolts, jumps and cuts sideways and from different angles often.Other than that, this movie rocks!",8,0,1,2 September 2007
Oblivion," An engaging sci-fi with heart and soul
","It's by serendipity that Iron Man 3 ticket ran out and we ended up watching Oblivion in a cinema filled with only a dozen audience.However, the movie was such a wonderful experience (even cathartic I might add) and mature in its sci-fi conception, that we left the theatre feeling satisfied.Oblivion feels like a love letter to classic sci-fi movies of bygone eras. As the writer-director Kosinski weaved an intricate narrative that questions the correlation between memories, love and the human identity in this post-apocalyptic future.The production design is reminiscent of Moon and Alien, whilst the minimalist cast and setting work well with the theme of isolation and 'last humans on Earth'. I would love to live in Jack Harper's Zen-like residence above the clouds.There are so many homages to classic sci-fi films such as Logan's Run, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Blade Runner, Silent Running, Total Recall to modern ones like Moon and War of the Worlds.The music is excellent and has a nostalgic vibe to it. The cast and acting are well performed and consistent. Although I think there is a little pacing issue especially during the lake cabin scenes. And perhaps a lack of chemistry between Kurylenko and Cruise, but the storyline makes up for it.But overall, Oblivion has become another favourite of mine, and deserve to enter the hall of classic sci-fi films for the ages.",8,1,4,28 April 2013
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," An excellent achievement and magical movie
","LOTR: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RINGGrowing up in a non-English speaking country, I had only first heard of 'Lord of the Rings' during my tertiary studies overseas. A Malaysian good friend of mine told me how good the books were, but I never really got to know what the story was. That is until I came to New Zealand and had some local friends who enthusiastically filled me in with the main plots of the books. Only then I realized how great Tolkien's imagination was and how his writings had influenced our modern conception of sword and sorcery tales.Having seen the movie and becoming more familiar with the detailed narration of Tolkien's masterpiece and symbolism, I realized that his story had been adapted into many books, games, films and toys around the world. From US's Dungeons & Dragon to Japan's Record of Lodoss War, LOTR is definitely the prime source material. And as such, the world described by Tolkien is richer, with superior story-telling and grandeur in scope. Director Peter Jackson with his excellent cast and crew and New Line Cinema backing, had done justice to the first chapter of the books. The Fellowship of the Ring itself is a loyal movie adaptation of the books, which I understand are great achievements in the English literary world.One of the most important instrinsic aspects of the movie is the beautiful terrains of Tolkien's world, transformed vividly into celluloid, courtesy of the beautiful and diverse New Zealand's topography. Credits must also go to those hundreds of New Zealand Army members who joined the movie as Orcs and Goblin warriors. I also liked how the each characters from the books, were brought to life by such great performances. While wacthing the movie, I can see that the movie staff had selected thespians who would embody the essences of the protagonists and antagonists, and NOT the other way around as we have seen done in some great but disappointing sci-fi movies lately. Because of this careful selection and respect towards the integrity of the characterization, we are awarded with a well-chosen international cast. Each person brings his/her own charisma and personality that is magically entwines with the others', as the story progresses and takes us from one action to another, rendering a powerful and entertaining fairy tale.Sean Bean has always been a fav. actor of mine, his portrayal of Boromir is very humane, complete with its strength, despair and sympathy. Elijah Wood's Frodo is sweet and a bit on the wimp side, with a child-like innocence. Merry, Pippin and Samwise characters were performed with genuine care, stereotyped at times but always courageous, and not the regular stupid or useless sidekicks. I guess Mortessen's voice is less charismatic although he definitely has that wild edge and devilishly handsome. My favourite character has to be Legolas, one cool elf-dude, complete with bow&arrows and two short scimitars. He has a remarkable speed, wisdom beyond his age, a sleek and eco-friendly costume and most of all a graceful appearance and manner. When he engages in a battle, he fights elegantly with wit and agility; light as a feather and fast as fury.It's funny to see Liv Tyler as an elf, because that was my first impression of her when I first saw her in one of those Aerosmith's video clips. Blanchett's Galadriel is another gift, she has always been alluring and elegant in most films, and there is just something sensual about her features. It is a pity that Gimli is not as menacing as he should have been, but nevertheless when he fights, axes are bound to be flying. The digital effects were smartly controlled and used when necessary, so they wouldn't jeopardized the narration, as it did in The Phantom Menace. Lucas take notes!At the end of this three-hour of pure entertainment and amazement, I was so mesmerized and fulfilled that I give 10 out of 10 for this movie. The movie just delivers, nothing is disappointing. I've heard several people complained that the movie was overlong and boring. Now when I watched the film, half of the audience clapped their hands at the end of the show, while most of the other half walked out with satisfied grins and began to 'wow'. The only person who said how boring it was, was this 5 year old girl who was sitting next to me and couldn't wait for the movie to finish.",9,0,0,22 December 2001
The Matrix Revolutions," Better than Reloaded
","A good tip for you to enjoy a hyped blockbuster movie, is to watch it without expectations as best as you can. Or at least imagine/put the movie into a 'right' perspective.I was disappointed with 'Reloaded' after all the hype that Wachowski Bros. and the media had promised us. I felt like I was watching a video game and there were several other aspects of the movie, that just didn't live up to my expectations.Looking back at 'Realoaded' now, it seemed that that movie was just a set-up for 'Revolution.' So with this idea in mind, and hoping I would be seeing another video game movie, I was satisfied indeed with 'Revolution.'The 20-min battle scene was well-executed, and even the Kid didn't act like a looser anymore. There were many strong characters in the movie, and I wished the directors had spent more time with them. Well, I'm looking forward to any expansions of The Matrix saga.R.",7,0,0,17 November 2003
Pitch Black," an entertaining stylish movie
","If you go and see this film without much expectation, it will amaze you, and if you do, it will still entertain you more than other horror/sci-fi movies, that came out after Aliens. Set up on a barren planet, the lighting, landscape and equipments were stylistically filmed and beautifully set up. The shades of blue, yellow, red and white, polish the film with an edge that is equally balanced with good performances from the mostly not-famous actors. Although there is not much science in this fiction, there are bits of pieces of how the world work in this alternate future. The interaction between the characters and how they quickly work as a team is very well conceived, as it also fills in the lack of background or scientific rationalization of the crew's history, the planet's or the creatures'.Vin Diesel as stated elsewhere, steals the highlight of the movie, with a charismatic presence and a cool portrayal of an anti-hero. There are surprises along the way, with little humour here and there.
It could've been longer and more gory, but I guess the director/producer didn't want to overdo it. So when you count on the low bodycounts and how people die, it is not so much of a horror movie as it is more of a survival thriller.My only complaint is that the creatures are animated, so they don't look/feel that threatening, as opposed to Alien/Aliens animatronics, courtesy of Stan Winston.Overall, this is a highly entertaining stylish movie.Log out.",8,0,0,27 September 2001
Dark City," In the eyes of an amateur movie-lover...
","there's not much of a deep analysis I can present, except of the understanding of all of the relations and influences of classic sci-fi and noir films of the old, upon Dark City. In fact I almost fell asleep while watching it the first time, on the big screen. But there was something in the movie that made me wanted to see it twice. I did, several months later on VCD format.It's the darkness that envelops the entire city, the loneliness felt by the characters, the uncertainties of their surroundings. The settings, ligthing, costume and mystery. But mostly it is because of the movie's multi-layered symbolism. We see something in each of that layer. I can relate with John's confusion and identity-crisis. Waking up in a imaginary land, where ominous beings are chasing you, a beautiful yet estranged lady with long dark hair, the stench of the pipes' smokes, the spiral into oblivion, aren't these the stuff of dreams/nightmares?There is something that is almost sub-conscious about the movie. It could mean anything to different people. For me, I too share John's confusion and struggle to retain his false memories. In the end what matters is your own conception of the truth. After the realization of John's and the dark city's true nature, he finds the courage to fight back the ominous beings who control and rule the cityscape. They are perhaps the embodiment of our own society's puppeteers: soulless aliens trying to understand, but could never have, the soul. John finally finds the courage and strength to shape a reality of his own. Afterall the truth is only as real as the mind's eye choose to perceive. The rest is but a fabrication of random occurances and coincidences. Strangely enough, that is what I 'feel' by watching Dark City. It is a personal inner journey from a dark spiral of endless flight, to the realization of the truth, making your stand and walking that narrow alley to earn your prize: a brightly-lit oceanscape of fresh air and a beautiful woman by your side. Finding peace and enlightenment.PS: Rufus Sewell plays with excellent subtlety, with captivating performances from the rest of the actors/actresses.",7,0,1,24 December 2001
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Right down there with the Twilight series
","Cash grab J.K. Rowling with her merry band of Hollyweird associates wooed audiences with nice period costumes and quality production, covering a carcass of hollow story and characters bereft of real drama. It is the kind of quality writing on par with the likes of Twilight series.",4,4,6,16 November 2018
Resident Evil," Could have been better.
","My word of advice for Milla, drop the Crouching Tiger flying slow-mo kicks and commit the next flick to realism. As a self-confessed Resident Evil's fan, she didn't stay true to the game, although the atmosphere is almost there.The music was wrong, the characters got killed up too quickly and I only wished they had the original Japanese game developers, to develop the story. The original Bio-Hazard game (the original Japanese game) was just perfect in everything in a movie sense. The suspense, the atmosphere, sound, etc. Oh well, better luck next time.",5,0,0,22 October 2003
Batman Begins," Excellent work! A first for DC and Warner Bros.
","An excellent movie with incredible cast, crew and director. Top-notch screenplay and performances. It is how a Batman movie should be made. Dark, intriguing and a thrill ride from the beginning till the end. I'm quite surprised how scary some scenes are. Congratulation to both Christian Bale and Christopher Nolan for their contribution to the Bat-franchise.Batman Begins washes away the bad taste left by Joel Schumacher and George Clooney from their previous collaborations on the Bat movies.This is surely the first modern DC Comics-based movie that has got things right. We can only hope that Warner Bros maintain their quality, and avoid making another Catwoman or Batman & Robin flicks again.I'd love to give this movie a 10/10, but 1 point has to be reduced because of lack of continuity with the comics series.Come on DC, if Marvel can do it, so can you!",8,2,4,10 July 2005
X-Men: The Last Stand," Going back to the drawing board
","The loss of director Bryan Singer affected X3 immensely. The great build-up and characterisations of X2 did not bear any fruits, as X3 lacks quality, consistency and coherent narration.Throughout the movie Brett Ratner's direction is sporadic, with high-octaned battle sequences and low in-betweens. It is clear from the start that he is uncomfortable or rather inexperienced in directing a fantasy/comics-based movie, as he couldn't decide if X3 should be a Prison Break drama, a Rush Hour comedy or an X-Men movie.The introductions of Angel and Jean Grey/Phoenix feel abrupt, while too much time is given to Iceman, Rogue and Kitty Pride love triangle. The wonderful Nightcrawler has completely disappeared from the movie, whilst the highly potential characters of Beast and Colossus are not given enough development time that merits their characters' importance on the comics.Furthermore, killing Cyclops and Professor X makes the latter half of the movie unbalanced and insubstantial. Professor X IS the core of the X-Men and the main reason the story even exists. By removing both vital characters, and undermining Storm's powerful persona, the leadership of the X-Men is then left to Wolverine. Wolvering is not and will never be a leader material. His personality is such that he is a cool darkhorse, an outsider or a vagabond. He is neither a teacher nor a leader, and it is the wrong direction to take the movie.The screenwriter also made the wrong choice of additional villains, although Juggernaut was fun to watch. Finally, the last stand at the Alcatraz Lab island feels more of a skirmish than a full blown war. Bring out the Sentinels in X4 and get rid of Brett Ratner, if there will ever be another sequel.",6,1,1,13 June 2006
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Not bad.
","A bit disappointing, after all the hype. But this is a well-made movie, nevertheless. It deserves a second viewing, and perhaps after that, my mind will change for the better.I understand that this movie is a tribute to Hong Kong and Japanese martial arts movies throughout the decades. And everyone seems to know that Tarantino had been a long time Asian cinema fan, and that Kill Bill is his dream project.Well, to be honest, the movie come across as a blend of different genre. At one side it is an unforgiving and violent Japanese crime movie. On the other side it is purely Tarantino.My only problem after watching the movie was there was simply nothing to talk about. The movie came about as a shallow gorefest flick. That's about it. The soundtrack and setting was not bad though, and I did enjoy the verbal jokes with Hattori Hanzou.",7,0,1,22 October 2003
Ip Man," Energetic & brilliant HK action drama
","This is Donnie Yen's best acting piece for awhile now, and he still delivers the action sequences brilliantly. At 44 years of age, he looks so energetic, confident and charismatic. I believe the combination of Yen, Sammo Hung and Wilson Yip is the right choice for this particular film and fighting style. Wing Chun is best depicted without the flamboyant ballet of acrobatics often seen in other wushu films.The movie doesn't dwell on historical accuracy, but rather use that settings to set the mood, deliver the message and simply tells you the life journey of a Grandmaster in an fun and entertaining way.I remember that Richard Attenborough said (regarding Gandhi) that there was no way a director/movie maker could encompass and depict a person's life journey in only a 2 or 3-hour movie. But rather one should aim to emulate the spirit of that person, and the message/lesson of his story. I think this movie does that, with a quality production that raised the bar for period drama.My rating is missing 1 point because I feel that there were plot devices that had been done-to-death before in other movies like: Fists of Fury, Fearless, Kill Bill, etc. However, Yip Man simply turns the notch to a higher sound-beating level.Don't miss this on the big screen!",9,116,130,18 December 2008
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," An Entertaining Christmas Flick
","I think this was a good adaptation from the original novel and an entertaining movie for Christmas. It must've been a fantastic movie for Potter's fans, since Rowling was very much involved in maintaining originality in the film making. The special effects and casting were good and well polished. The setting and atmosphere were magical too. A highly recommended adventure for the young ones. In terms of target reader/audience, the movie producer and J.K. Rowling have got it right. It was indeed a story that appeals more to the young audience, but rather shallow for mature audiences. I suggest reading The Books of Magic series, courtesy of DC/Vertigo Comics, a brilliant and superior predecessor to Harry Potter, by Neil Gaiman, John Bolton and John Ney Rieber.",5,0,0,16 December 2001
The Witch," A well made horror gem marred by its horrible message
","This is the first time I ever gave a well made movie a vote of 2 due to its horrible message about faith, family and for its satanic undertone.One point is given for its well-researched, written, directed and acted film. The production value and cinematography are excellent for an indie movie. I applaud the director's effort to stay true to his vision, and perhaps somewhere in there, was a genuine attempt to create a contemporary horror inspired by 'folk tales, fairy tales and true accounts of witch craft' as stated by the pre-credit scene. The director himself has said he wanted to create a horror tale that befitted his home in New England.The second point is given for the cast's amazing acting, especially Anya Taylor-Joy. She was a revelation to behold, captivating and hypnotizing just like Natalie Portman was in Leon The Professional.The movie felt like what it would be like if 'The Blair Witch Project' had been directed by Terrence Malick. However, unlike Malick's overarching theme of enlightenment or spiritualism via Nature and its ties with humanity, Egger's The Witch feels like the Bizarro of Superman. The Witch is like an evil doppelganger of Malick's movies, where faith, family unity and nature itself are constantly doubted, inherently flawed and imbued with the propensity towards Evil. SPOILERS The animals, forest and weather in the movie are means by which the Devil himself tears the family apart.The witch craft and hex scenes are truly disturbing and the overall tone of the movie made me feel sick. And I grew up watching horror movies for over three decades.At the end when all the children are dead, the parents murdered and the baby boy slaughtered, we found the surviving daughter, Thomasin, actually converted to wicca and joined the coven. The very coven, whose member has attacked, abducted, molested and murdered her family. Some critics said the movie was about feminism and its fight against patriarchy. But when The Satanic Temple praised its message about women liberation and satanic spirituality, is that actually a positive message? Would you equate feminism = satanic worship? Is Wicca = Satanism?There are some horrific scenes in the movies that are disturbing on a visual, aural and intrinsic levels.The ending also finds our young protagonist joining the coven, flying towards the moon naked and filled with ecstasy. All of these after signing her name on the book of the damned as she was tempted by Black Phillip. It was also revealed that the production house of the movie, A24, collaborated with The Satanic Temple in Detroit to promote the movie by setting up advance screening. The production house might have thought this was a smart marketing strategy to promote the movie. The director, Robert Eggers, might have not intended a feminist read into the movie or even to make his film a satanic propaganda. Regardless of what their true motivations were, I find this movie thoroughly irresponsible in its depiction of nature worship, feminism and psychological traumas.Could we believe that the award-winning level of fastidiousness and filmmaking skills of the director (and the studio) be complemented by such massive disregards for spiritualism. Is the nightmarish and downright anti-social message of the movie simply an ill-considered side effect of the director's attempt to shock and awe his audience.However you want to cut this cake - I'd say for the love of everything that is good and holy in the world - stay away from watching this ill conceived movie.It's not only sacrilegious towards religion, but towards life and nature itself.",2,7,17,24 April 2016
Zero Dark Thirty," A well made Hollywood propaganda
","This is a well-directed movie and the last portion of the film is thrilling to watch.Unfortunately, the story itself and how it is shown is purely a blatant propaganda for the CIA and US military, disguised as an entertainment. It is very much one-sided and completely justifies the cruelty and motives of the US war on terror.The opening declaration that the movie is based on first-hand account of real events is also misleading and irresponsible.As a two-edged sword, the movie is also a political and religious ammunition of those extremists who preach the gospel of hate. Hollywood movies are far-reaching and can easily sway the ignorant masses, as such a director of Bigelow's stature will be judged on a higher standard.Of which, she failed miserably to live up to that standard.",4,8,16,18 March 2013
Prometheus," A faded carbon copy of what could have been a masterpiece
","My high anticipation for Prometheus was answered with a sigh and a whimper. The cinematography, VFX and production design are spectacular. But little can be said of characterization and direction.There are too many plot holes, lack of tension and good drama that we would expect of Scott's direction. None of the qualities that made Alien such a classic movie are present here.In fact the entire journey felt like a faded carbon copy of what the original intended movie was - an Alien prequel. If they had stayed true to that plan, this would have been a slightly more enjoyable experience. Although it is a gorgeous looking movie with some allusion to the Alien franchise, I have no connection with any of the character. Except perhaps a little sympathy for David, but even his character is a conundrum.The movie opens up well up to the point of the crew waking up from cryo-sleep. Even Cameron's 2-dimensional gung-ho Marines from Aliens were much more tangible and sympathetic than this bunch of riff-raff of pseudo scientists. The aliens in this movie are also weak, comical and reminds me of raw seafood.They don't scare nor disturb me. There is a couple of gory scenes but they had no lingering impacts because they were executed in such abandon for logic and care.Then there is the Engineers who have a different origin and look than the ones we came to know from the comics. The planet they were on is not the same as the one from the Alien and Aliens, and it's a different ship too.I was left wanting and felt betrayed by Scott. A sad disappointing movie that is only slightly better than AVP.",6,4,9,9 June 2012
X-Men: First Class," A great beginning with lots of fun and poignant moments
","The direction, story and acting in this movie is near perfect. Matthew Vaughn has sealed his credibility as a solid storyteller who weaves poignant character developments with fun action sequences. The set pieces, balance, pacing and cameos are well crafted. I had reservation about the choices of mutants before watching the movie but now I understand that they were selected for the right reasons. And that is to present the audience with a prequel that not only raises the bar for the franchise but also revives my faith in the series. X-Men 3 and Wolverine were short of disasters, but here the cast and crews have managed to breath a new life into a series that was getting near to downright embarrassment. Even though the movie is set as a prequel it never failed to deliver a mature performance unmarred by asinine silliness that often haunts action/superheroes genre when majority of the cast involves adolescents.The movie is largely based on the New X-Men saga by Grant Morrison, but it's not considered canon because it sits between the main and the Ultimate timelines. The stage is set, the quality is astounding so let's bring on the rest of the sequels.",9,2,5,6 June 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," The pinnacle of the Batman trilogy
","We decided to watch The Dark Knight Rises even though we were not sure about the movie being too dark or depressing like The Dark Knight. To my surprise it is a superior movie that wonderfully finishes the story of this trilogy with an uplifting end.It's a long ensemble movie that focuses on a mature storyline, characterization, production design and a sheer thrill ride from beginning to the end. Any great Batman comics always has at its center, a great story. And this movie delivers on all fronts criticizing our current financial woes, domestic terrorism, Patriot Act, civil defense, while staying true the previous movies and its comics roots.The actions, gadgets, weapons and cars were just icing on the cake in this respect. But even so, the action sequences were orchestrated with great composition and effectiveness by the great maestro, Chris Nolan and his crew, so that they carry the story forward and adds to the drama.The movie also has hearts and probably the most engaging interaction between Bruce Wayne, Alfred, Commissioner Gordon and others. I feel that their interactions has more substance and repercussion than the previous installment. Even Jim Gordon has some action scenes. Honestly, I have not felt so much thrill in a cinema and my heart was pounding all the way through the last 15-20 minutes of the movie.In terms of characterization, where The Dark Knight was always in the danger of being overshadowed by the Joker and Harvey Dent/Two-Face, here Batman/Bruce Wayne plays a central role. The rest of the characters are then weaved into a beautiful tapestry of drama and mystery worthy of Frank Miller or Dough Moench.By the end, The Dark Knight Rises feels like a cacophony that gets louder and stronger as it progresses from darkness to light, and eventually rewards its audience with a great closure to a great trilogy.Furthermore, I love all the references and tributes to all the comics series that have inspired the movie, such as: Knightfall/KnightsEnd, No Man's Land, Batman: Year One and Two, Vengeance of Bane, Tales of the Demon, etc.The last scene alone was a wonderful kudos to Batman comics in the 1950s, where fans are given a glimpse of what life is like for Bruce Wayne after Batman. And of course the cameos from Ra's Al Ghul and Jonathan Crane were nice little treats, if not a little short.Amanda Tate and John Blake were wonderful additions to the story, and in case of the latter, a nod to the future.Here's a toast to Nolan & Co. for giving this long-time Batman fan an incredible masterpiece that rises above expectations and shines through the dark skies of Hollywood like the Batman beacon.",9,3,7,21 July 2012
Life," Surprisingly an effective scifi-horror in the tradition of Alien
","There are so many negative reviews about Life, yet I found this sci-fi horror to be effective and a genuine tribute to Alien. The cast all performed well and relatable. Only one character who genuinely pissed me off, whereas in other space horror movies, usually the majority of them would be annoying and silly.Although the dialogues and themes explored are not as philosophical as in Sunshine, they are much better written and acted characters compared to the jokers in Gravity.The seven astronauts working on the Mars lifeform aboard ISS are more believable and likeable than those jokers in Gravity.Here, the special effect of the ISS is well done, except for the part of the astronauts floating effect. You can see where they attached the actors with strings to float them. The ISS itself is well designed and there are some creative camera techniques in this movie.Now when it comes to the horror element, I think the director and cast have done a good job in creating sheer terror. Over the span of the movie, the cute little algae-alien rapidly evolves into a ravenous space starfish. Some of the chase and hide & seek scenes are fresh and creatively written, although at times what the characters do or say have been designed to entertain and create suspense while sacrificing a more realistic approach that movies like 2001 or Interstellar have done.There are moments throughout the movie that disgusted and scared me in a good way. In a way that transported me to a time when I watched Alien and Aliens for the first time as a young chap. Ironically, Life is more successful in creating that foreboding terror than Alien: Covenant. Give this movie a chance and enjoy the ride.",7,0,1,1 January 2018
300," A brilliant adaptation of Frank Miller's comic books
","The austere design and sepia cinematography of this movie is beautiful. It is a brilliant adaptation of Frank Miller's comics, staying true to the visual and literary simplicity of the comic form.The dialogues are clichés and chauvinistic, at times riddled with contradictions and rampant war propaganda. But suffice it to say one should watch the movie for its sheer entertainment value, as this movie is based on a fictitious comic book. Frank Miller loves gore, stylised violence and awkward sensibility, and all of these elements are well conveyed in the movie version of '300'.300 is a pure adrenaline rush of awesome visual and hyperkinetic violence. A respectful and remarkable tribute to Frank Miller.",8,3,7,5 April 2007
Cube," Gripping Suspense all the way.
","Having read a review article of this movie on IMDB two months ago, I decided to rent the video. It turned out to be a gripping suspense all the way through. The movie was written based on a clever concept that mixes psychology, math and socio-politics criticism. Furthermore, the Cube was filmed as a multi-layered narration. On one level it tells the story of six people imprisoned within a labyrinth of compartments in the shape of cubes. Each compartment had been designed and assembled according to mathematical formula based on a 3-D cube. All six 'prisoners' have to work together using each of his/her skills/knowledge in order to find the exit, before they die trapped within. It is interesting to see how each person contribute their 'knowledge' to decipher the planted 'map' and trying to survive some booby-trapped compartments and threats from themselves. Just like stated by one of the 'prisoners', Rennes:'You've gotta  save yourselves from yourselves'. That line itself is a direct message of the second level of the movie: social criticism. I felt that the movie's pacing and characters' dialogues truly built up the tension, as the audience and the characters are progressively swallowed by a claustrophobic sense. But the real kick of the movie is the message of the story. Basically what the writers are saying is that, so long as the people of our 'modern' society is segregated into myriad 'professional working fields' (for example) and each section doesn't want to know how they are connected or need each other, we all will always live like prisoners inside the 'system'. A system that is getting out of control, as each individual is too busy with his/her own life. That kind of ignorance will eventually breaks down all social orders and kill the people who the system suppose to protect, as it did in the movie. The 'system' has become the prison, represented as the cube inside the movie.The acting may seem rather flat and the characters are eventually two dimensional, since 90 minutes is not a lot of time to build a strong background for each character or the nature of the cube itself. But you can still enjoy the suspense, good interaction, disturbing settings and ponder upon the message.",8,0,1,11 December 2001
Mad Max: Fury Road," A madly beautiful post-apocalyptic movie in ages
","Insane. Captivating. Frenetic. Visceral. Beautiful.Mad Max Fury Road is a frenetic roller coaster ride unlike any other. It was written with minimalist dialogue, saturated colour palette and a visceral neck break speed. The smooth blend between practical VFX and CGI makes the movie believable, and yet feels so otherworldly. Miller & co. directed his movie like fine arts maestros as if it were a motion painting - an artistic expression of art, visual, sound and motion.In Fury Road, we find Max Rockatansky played by Tom Hardy, haunted by his past (with strobing flashes of characters from the first movie) traversing the bleak desert landscape of a future world where the Earth has become almost barren due to nuclear war. There he struggles to survive by driving his Interceptor car from place to place, avoiding marauding gangs and running away from the ghosts of his past.We find Max's survival skills intact, wearing the same jacket from the Mel Gibson's days, complete with his cool Interceptor, knee harness and shotgun. I still miss his dog, and it is a pity that the Interceptor is destroyed so quickly in the beginning of the movie. I've read that the video game builds a back story where you control Max and trying to build his Interceptor.The movie movie is set in a world where food and water are scarce. Nature and humans have mutated, and humanity is enslaved by its own survival instinct. In this chapter, we get a glimpse of a town ruled by Immortan Joe, a disfigured old tyrant, who lives atop a rocky cliff. In the caverns of his palace, he has adequate water, plants and slaves to do his bidding. From time to time, he would send out his lieutenant, Imperator Furiosa, to retrieve oil from one of the last remaining oil rigs near his town. The movie's plot basically revolves around Furiosa's plot to safely elope with Immortan's wives to the Green Place, her childhood birthplace.Almost the entire movie is a long string of car chase sequences, that needs to be experienced in the cinema. It's simply a tour de force of the car chase sub-genre. In a time when we have series like The Transporter, Fast Furious and well made post-apocalyptic features - it's amazing how Fury Road can stands on its own weight and deliver something fresh and unique.I have to say that compared with Gibson's version, Hardy's Max is slightly mad and at times feels like he is just a passenger in Furiosa's story. The scenes with the guitarist, the custom cars and war rigs fights were thrilling and pure popcorn cinema. Though the level of violence is not as brutal as Mad Max 1 & 2, Fury Road is still dark and unsettling in some places. My wife still finds the movie too violent, but nevertheless entertaining.Go see it today, you owe yourself a speedy treat!",9,12,25,6 June 2015
