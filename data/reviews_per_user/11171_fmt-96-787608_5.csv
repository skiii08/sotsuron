Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Ain't it's best movie
","Still good of course. The best is the 1st one. It's not about scenario. It's about the story telling. It's not about the photography. It's about the way he's behind the cam. The one is so implicated, so personal thai it talks to the audience straight in the heart. This one talks to our mind. That's not bad. Of course it's not. But it has definitely not the same impact.",6,0,1,2 May 2018
Barry Lyndon," A Masterpiece (and 2 flats)
","Of course Barry Lyndon IS a Masterpiece. Stanley Kubrick was obviously Stanley Kubrick from his very first day as a filmmaker. The stunning light, the mastermind in every camera position (lenses !), costumes and sceneries are so opulent that almost every scene looks like a painting. Outstanding. Both in- and outdoor stages are remarkable and of equal quality: perfect. My 'problem' with Barry Lyndon is neither with actors (they are all so authentic), nor with its narrative parts as literature. No ! My 'problem' is about perfection (and the recurrent Sarabande by HÃ¤ndel as herald change in every appointment with death). Perfection during 3 hours makes me feel dizzy at the end. But anyway, Barry Lyndon IS a Masterpiece in both Stanley Kubrick's work and in the history of cinema.",9,1,2,4 July 2019
Captain America: Civil War," Would have been a good movie if....
",... it this 'fugly' airport scene did not exist... It literally killed me,4,3,4,1 May 2018
Black Panther," The casting couldn't save that shipwreck
","I couldn't be more excited to watch what they promised us to be 'the greatest Marvel movie ever'. Well well well... On behave of a firework, this movie is a real damp squib. The film frustrates as much as it motivared. A loss like this one wasn't easy at all to achieve. They did it. Technology and special effects can't save a single thing here. Soundtrack is with the image of this definitive and expensive mess.",2,10,16,18 January 2019
Mother!," Sick and disturbing but ....
","Well. I gave 5 stars mainly for one reason: the malaise felt while watching this movie. Aronofsky slowly builds something like a torture. The movie is and gets sick. Everything sacred in our society is broken here, destroyed, trampled. After 3 seconds, we immediately get that the descent to hell will be unstoppable. As the film progresses, we only wish one thing: to be able to take it and to be capable to see the end of this interesting artwork. No masterwork here for me (screenplay with too many limitations, and even a few weaknesses) but a real artwork, disturbing at will, played by a couple of good actors.",5,0,0,20 August 2018
