Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," What might have been...
","Pretty much a big dissapointment for me, way overhyped.  thespecial effects are of course fantastic but even those get dullafter awhile.  Where's the human touch?  the characters are atbest bland, at worst not even real - if Lucas had his wishthey'd all be digital.  The story was also suprisingly mundane; It would have been a helluva lot more interesting if Lucasstarted from the beginning:  how did the Jedis begin?  All thistrade nonsense was truly boring.  Oh well, there's always thefirst two movies - you can't improve on those two, and this onetries way to hard but is no match for the",Null,0,1,26 November 1999
Shakespeare in Love," Swashbuckling bard
","Gee, I had no idea Will Shakespeare kicked butt like this?  I guess I would too if fighting in the midst of gorgeous Gwynyth  Paltrow.  This movie is pure fantsasy, and is richly entertaning if taken at that level;  I just hope some folks out there don't take it as literal (or close to literal) fact.  Geoofery Roush is hillariious, Judi Dench is grand as the Queen and Ben Affleck plays the master thespian well, but the real star is the chemistry between Shakespeare and his muse, and the smart screenplay is a close second.  Top it off with a gorgeous score and taught direction and you've got a real winner.  Don't miss this one - its worthy of its award status!",9,7,11,20 July 1999
MASH," A 'Mashterpiece'
","What a movie.  Probably the most uniquely irreverent movie I've ever seen.  Very typical of the independent movie  making spirit of Hollywood during this time, when movies had something to say. Forget the tv series (esp. the later years), this is the real thing (thanks Robert Altman)",Null,0,1,29 November 1999
The Godfather: Part II," Contrast of Family Life
","This movie is a masterpiece - it works beautifully as a contrast of changing times and the disintigration of family values.  The last scenes sum up the picture perfectly.  The young Vito Corleone holds the infant Michael, proclaiming his love for him.  Thirty years later the grown Michael coldly has his brother murdered.  Try and find a movie that has more emotional tragedy than this one.  The chronoligical video release of the first two movies totally loses the point of the second film.",10,0,0,10 September 1999
Notting Hill," What's her name looks just like Julia Roberts!
","This film is a real charmer;  Roberts takes a chance with this role, and its fun wondering how much of her performance is based on the script and how much is based on her real life.  Hugh Grant is fine as well but it wouldve been even more of a treat to cast an unkown in his part (like me for instance!).  As far as casting goes its obvious noone else could have played Ms. Roberts role, but the Hugh Grant part probably exists in many male fanatasies, including this one...the only other minor change I would've made would have been to have her use her real name in the film;  I'll bet like me everyone replaced 'Anna' with 'Julia' anyways!  If you enjoy Julia don't miss this one - you won't be dissapointed!",Null,0,0,15 July 2000
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," If you haven't read the novel -
","the movie won't make alot of sense.  'Rings' is an action adventure all the way, forsaking the mythologic middle earth of Tolkien's novel for a 'Star Wars:  Phantom Menace' style wanna be epic.  As such I found it overlong and dullish, but it would be perfect for those 30 yr old nerdish types who live for these types of things.",Null,0,0,23 March 2002
American Beauty," The BEST movie ever???
","ok, I haven't seen this movie, but the best of all time??? Get real!  I guess there's no way I can see it and not be disapointed if it isn't the best movie ever as determined by the IMDB votes.  Unbelievable..",1,0,5,30 November 1999
American Beauty," A Winner All The Way
","Hilarious and painful all at the same time, a triumph of acting, directing and screenwriting.  Could be the defining movie of the 90's.  Don't miss this one - Spacey is incredible! Everything is right in this edgy, unpredictable masterpiece.",1,0,6,25 June 2000
Moulin Rouge!," This movie rocks!
","I was very pleasantly surprised - Moulin Rouge takes alot of chances, and most of them work.  Very exciting throughout, its easy to look past the clich-ish love story with the clever and spectacular musical numbers and top notch acting.  Btw, Tom Cruise is crazy;  Nicole Kidman in totally gorgeous in carrying this star vehicle!  Watch 'Moulin Rouge' and prepare to be enthralled; one of the best of this year...",Null,1,2,23 March 2002
Some Like It Hot," An utter classic!
","Just a flawless movie all around;  terrific acting, direction, screenplay, it all works to perfection! Easily Monroe's best role, and Curtis and Lemmon are outstanding also.  Mandatory viewing for any film aficianado!  And the black and white cinematography works splendidly!",Null,1,2,9 February 2003
Bruce Almighty," Don't worry if you miss this one
","A pretty bland effort overall;  I like Jim Carrey but this star vehicle just doesn't add up.  Why would God choose this guy anyways, just because he's funny???  Or obnoxious???  Jennifer Anniston is wasted and I didn't buy Morgan Freeman as the Lord either - too many pot marks on the face and a Yankees cap???  But the worst sin is that this is just another obnoxious guy learns his lesson and becomes a better man because of it story, and I didn't buy for a minute that Carrey's character learned anything, despite a few trite apolgies and forced repention scenes toward the end.  Skip this one and go rent 'The Truman Show' instead!",Null,2,4,23 May 2003
Back to the Future," Delightfully contrived
","The only movies that may be more contrived than this one are its sequels, but that doesn't detract from this marvelously entertaining film.  It moves along at a breakneck pace with energetic performances and top notch special effects, with some amusing social commentary to boot.  Don't miss it!",Null,0,1,12 December 1999
