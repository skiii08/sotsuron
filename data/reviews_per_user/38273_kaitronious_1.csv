It," Overall, what I expected
","I didn't have incredibly high hopes for this movie, so it didn't disappoint... Until the last 1/3 of the flick! 
It was actually pretty scary from an adults point of view, and the cast was great. The acting was extremely believable, at times captivating, and better than anticipated. I feel like the plot moved along at a nice pace and kept you wondering what would happen next although most of us viewers have seen the original and read the book. 
My main problem was with the dancing clown scene, it was SO dumb. It ruined the fear that the rest of the movie had built up to that point, made me start laughing and I unfortunately abandoned all interest after that. They should have left more to the imagination, drawn that out longer, then showed more of the clown. 'It' became silly.",6,0,0,1 February 2018
