Hereditary," The torture of a teenage boy -- this is entertainment?
","I didn't think this was a very good movie, but I was deeply moved by the performance of Alex Wolff as Peter, a young lost soul in a family torn by mental illness.The movie draws you in in its first third, as we observe dour, washed-out mom Annie (Toni Collette) going through the motions of her life with Peter, odd daughter Charlie (Milly Shapiro), and calm, see-no-evil husband Steve (Gabriel Byrne).Annie is deeply angry and bullies everyone in the family, fatefully forcing Peter to drag Charlie to a party one night. This demand makes no sense for anyone, but Peter goes along. Things go horribly, and Wolff is deeply affecting as a young person who tries to cope with trauma with absolutely no help from the adults in his life.The rage that flares between Annie and Peter over dinner one night is stunning. However, the movie goes severely down hill from there, as it descends into a cheap knock-off of 'Rosemary's Baby,' with tacky references to 'Poltergeist.'What I'm left with in reviewing this film is the anguished cries of Peter as he wrestles with his mother's insanity and cruelty. As the mother of boys who are about Peter's age, I found the poignancy of Peter's situation to be wrenching. What a bravura performance!I've read that some other reviewers think Ms. Collette should have gotten an Oscar. She is indeed scary in this film, but to my mind, her antics are far from indelible.",5,1,4,16 December 2019
Passengers," 'I'm scared -- I'm fighting to stay calm'
","Technology will continue its inexorable advance, but Adam will never stop desiring an Eve.With an age-old plot line clothed in the flashiest of high-tech wrappings, along with excellent casting and acting, 'Passengers' makes for one of the more satisfying space movies in memory.Here we've got the story of working joe Jim Preston (Chris Pratt), who is hurtling at half the speed of light toward a colony of humans on a faraway space body. Upon awakening 90 years prematurely from what was supposed to be a 120-year hibernation, with 5,000 other passengers slumbering around him according to plan, Jim wrestles over whether to awaken fellow traveler Aurora Lane (Jennifer Lawrence) -- offering himself the hope of companionship but killing her chances of achieving intergalactic emigration.I appreciated this movie's emphasis on characterization over high-tech jargon and special effects, although many scenes are visually riveting (i.e. when a sudden drop in gravity turns the spaceship's swimming pool into a life-threatening vortex).I was unfamiliar with Pratt, but he turns in a nuanced performance here, bringing to mind fellow film hunks Josh Brolin and Christian Bale. I also liked the work of Ms. Lawrence, who believably goes from liking Jim, to wanting to kill him, to finally realizing that she wouldn't want to live without him. Also good are Laurence Fishburne in the small role of unflappable control-room techie Gus Mancuso and Andy Garcia in a cameo as the spaceship's captain.This film poses some intriguing moral questions while poking fun at the limitations of technology. (Anyone who thinks a robot could ever replace a friend will be disabused of the notion here.) We also get some commentary on the commercialization that would inevitably follow man into the far reaches of the multiverse. For example, we learn that Jim didn't have to pay full fare for his ride to another world -- 'I'm in a desirable trade,' he tells Aurora. That translates into cheaper, duller food than Aurora gets at the spaceship breakfast bar.We also observe a tweaking of the notion that technology can be trusted. Hibernation pods on the Avalon were supposed to be fail-safe. But if they had been, there wouldn't have been any story here.In the end, this is a poignant tale about the human condition. People can careen erratically between love and enmity. But in the end, all we've really got is each other. 'It ain't right,' a world-weary Gus tells Aurora, 'but the drowning man will always try to drag someone down with him.' Ain't it the truth!",7,1,1,15 April 2019
Hostel," California -- 'You are so far from home'
","I'm glad I saw this, though I had an exceedingly hard time getting through it. I succeeded because it was being shown in a horror-film class and I needed to persevere. Otherwise, I'm not sure I would have made it.I am a horror-film fan, and a ninny who often hides my eyes. For the first time in my experience, I also tried to stop my ears. The sights and sounds in this movie combine to create a sense of being trapped that forces the viewer to experience vicarious psychological torture.Not exactly a fun time, but there is meaning here. As in a graphic horror movie like 'Cannibal Holocaust,' 'Hostel' should not be dismissed because of its shocking excesses.There IS a compelling story here. Two recent college grads from America, and their older Icelandic pal, are partying in Amsterdam, when, due to their obnoxious reaction to missing curfew at their hostel, they fall into the acquaintance of an Eastern European who describes a place where the sex is free and it's like child play to score. In no time, the trio hops a train to Slovakia.Uneasiness starts to build inexorably. These guys are rapacious exploiters, heading to Bratislava with a plan to bed local women. (Horror-movie buffs may recall the bravado of similarly cocky protagonists in 'The Blair Witch Project' and the aforementioned 'Holocaust.')We're somewhat discomfited by the vulnerability of Josh (Derek Richardson). He'd declined to pay for sex in Amsterdam, and, later on the train, reacts violently to a knee tap from a weird Dutch businessman (Jan Vlasak), who eats his salad with his fingers, explaining he enjoys making 'a connection with something that has died' for him. Er, OK. His creepy antics raise a red flag -- again, recall the warning sign of a guide's debilitating snake bite in 'Holocaust' -- but the tourists aren't about to turn back. How many people would? Life offers its share of strangeness, but how many of us ponder the potentialities?Sure enough, when our guys arrive at their Slovakian hostel, and follow some uninhibited local gals to a steam room, the sauna looks like every schoolboy's fantasy: 'Oh, s___ man, we're never leaving here!' (A little dark humor.)It's all a big setup. These outwardly crude, street-dumb horndogs are putty in the clutches of their handlers. Like a sinister sleight of hand, a crew of child street thugs surrounds Josh, only to be sent packing by, yep, the Dutch businessman. And soon Josh is apologetically offering this guy a drink. Bad move!The movie drives the viewer -- at least if she is of a certain age -- to feel a sense of protectiveness over the wayfarers. Yet we are as defenseless as they. The scene in which Josh awakens from being drugged, and finds himself chained, shackled, and desperately trying to understand, induces terror and panic. We become Josh -- how compelling is THAT for direction?I felt weak and defeated as I tried to get through this film. At a certain point, I reached for some life-giving, life-affirming sustenance, and ate some grapes. I thought of my loved ones and my wish for their safety. I uncomfortably remembered how we humans seem programmed to see so very little of what is actually present.'I get a lot of money for you,' Paxton's erstwhile sex partner gloats. 'And that makes YOU my b___.' One shivers here to remember a similar dynamic in the French-Dutch film 'The Vanishing,' in which a man is lured toward disaster out of a wish to solve a lover's disappearance.In class we discussed how this film came out after disclosures about US military abuses at the Abu Gharaib prison in Iraq. It was also in the years following the collapse of the Soviet Union, when former client states struggled to find a new economic track and corruption could flourish.",5,1,1,20 November 2019
Cloverfield," Post-9/11 us vs. them story via found footage
","On Sept. 11, 2001, for the first time since Pearl Harbor, Americans found themselves attacked when they least expected it.It's party time in the inscrutably titled 'Cloverfield,' as a roomful of millenials fete Rob (Michael Stahl-David) on the night before he's to leave for a job in Japan. We eavesdrop on conversational trivia, as Rob's best friend Hud (T.J. Miller) makes the rounds with a video camera, filming testimonials and gossip that Rob has bedded his brother's babe, Beth (Odette Annable).From out of nowhere, a thunderous crash resounds, the lights go out, and, just as in America on 9/11, life would never be the same. New York erupts into a chaotic frenzy of panicked humans amidst bombs and collapsing skyscrapers. A clueless TV anchor announces an oil tanker may have capsized near the Statue of Liberty. They wish!The horror in 'Cloverfield' derives from the pandemonium amidst humans who do not know what is happening. The movie weakens as it reveals we are dealing with monsters here. How much scarier this would have been if the foe had remained amorphous and intangible!This film effectively recreates the type of mayhem that ensued in the minutes and hours following the 9/11 attacks on New York City. How chilling to remember that World Trade Center denizens were told to remain in their office spaces after planes-as-bombs fueled an inferno in the upper reaches of the targets. In a similar case of the blind leading the blind, clueless civil authorities urge throngs to flee Manhattan -- 'If you're not injured, you gotta keep moving...Keep moving in a quick and orderly fashion!' -- only to witness the Brooklyn Bridge crumble into the East River.Our protagonists retrieve a voicemail from Beth, who begs Rob to help -- she's been pinned to the floor of her Columbus Circle apartment. Reaching her will mean flouting civil authorities' orders to flee south, but they head uptown anyhow. Tramping through a subway tunnel, member of the group Lizzie (Marlena Diamond) helps Hud avoid a monster but gets fatally stabbed. This grim interlude provides a lull in the action, a chance to catch one's breath, but this is only a delay in the next horrible twist in the plot. In 'Cloverfield' we see the ultimate portrayal of being able to run, but not hide.'We're gonna wait here till this passes,' Rob pants under a bridge in Central Park. Safe haven? Not in a post-9/11 world. 'I love you,' says Beth. 'I love you,' he replies. In the end, that's really all that matters in our short and fragile lives.",5,1,1,13 November 2019
Alien," A space-age Pandora's Box
","In an age of interstellar space travel, does one really want to take a job that requires investigating when a signal is picked somewhere in the ether? Hell, it could be a warning, an SOS, or anything!Such is the contractual lot of the crew of Nostromo, a hulking merchant spaceship returning to Earth with a load of planetary ore. It isn't long before a hideous space creature gains entry to the mother ship, because it's clinging to a crew member's face. Against her better judgment, and under peer pressure, commander of some sort Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) chucks the usual quarantine rules. After all, they can't leave their seriously wounded buddy on a godforsaken exoplanet. Or could they? Ripley's a tough sort and prefers that they do. When she's overruled, you know it's not good.In the wake of knock-offs that followed it -- 2017's 'Life' comes to mind -- 'Alien' doesn't seem that original today. Sure, the space fiend is hideous, dripping with goo, and murderously quick. I found it only mildly scary. Yet the movie does generate some suspense aboard ship, with its close quarters and dark corners.There's no question the creature startles when it bursts from the gut of the sticken crew member, in a perverse twist on Caesarian birth. However, its later attacks seem predictable. Although it IS creepy when Ripley finds the beast has stowed away aboard her escape shuttle. I'll admit I couldn't relax truly till I saw the final credits roll.Am I curious enough to see a sequel? Perhaps just the first. But I'm certainly not racing to the last remaining video store in Manhattan to reserve it!",6,1,4,10 September 2019
Get Out," 'I told you not to go in the house!'
","I found this movie helpful for depicting the experience of being black in America in a chilling way.Classified in various places as either a thriller or a horror movie, 'Get Out' has reportedly been described a documentary by its director, Jordan Peele. I can see his point.Daniel Kaluuya turns in a convincingly understated performance as Chris, an African-American man who, against the advice of his best friend ,Rod (Lil Rel Howery), agrees to visit the parents of his white girlfriend, Rose (Allison Williams).In a skin-crawling way, we observe here how liberal white folks unconsciously display prejudice in their own peculiar way. (Why does Rose's father -- 'We're huggers' -- find it necessary to tell Chris he'd have voted for Obama a third time?) For me, it was also uncomfortable as Rose tries to guide the behavior of Chris, as if he isn't capable of making his own choices. This is a rare perspective in our politically correct culture!Peele is known as a horror-movie fan, and 'Get Out' references scary classics of the past. The incongruously cheery score that sounds early in the film reminded me of the haunting strains of 'Cannibal Holocaust.' I remembered 'Deliverance' as Chris ventures into the woods after their car hits a deer. The movie recalls 'Hostel' when Chris awakens to find himself shackled into a chair. The bizarre auction scene conjures memories of 'Rosemary's Baby' and 'The Stepford Wives.'The racial politics of this film would have created a sufficient sense of horror, in my view. I was disappointed to see 'Get Out' veer into conventional slasher territory toward its end. I was also sorry to learn that this movie was constructed with a couple alternative endings. The one I viewed was perfect. When we see flashing lights approach Chris, we brace for hostile stereotyping. One doesn't expect a happy ending, but it does offer a bit of hope.",7,0,2,4 December 2019
Insidious," Surprised how bad this was
","I've never been a fan of haunted-house stuff, so I wasn't expecting much here, and I wasn't surprised at the mediocrity of this film.This is a stupid story about a couple whose older son is able to 'astrally project' so that he wanders around the spiritual world while his body lies in a coma at home. The only way to free this kid is to send his father into the ether to retrieve him. Er, OK.I gave this film two stars, rather than one, because it succeeded in producing a little tension as spooky things started to happen around the house. These occurrences are more creepy than scary and they get old fast. After a while they are downright dumb. A red-faced character that resembles a devil? I've seen scarier images in a coloring book.A big problem with this movie is that it tries to be funny amidst all this ridiculousness and fodder. This does no more than create cognitive dissonance and irritation in the viewer.I'd never have sought this film out, but it was screened as part of a horror-film class that I'm taking. Though presented as a good example of sound artistry, I didn't find 'Insidious' compelling even on that front.What does it say about our culture that a movie like this spawned three sequels? Now that's something to be scared about!PS: Don't be fooled by the appearance of Barbara Hershey in this film's cast.
No one's acting in this film is particularly interesting.",2,0,0,18 September 2019
Paranormal Activity," Haunted house or mental illness?
","It's not that I don't feel for Katie (Katie Featherstone). She's been plagued by hallucinations since the age of 8. Her boyfriend Micah (Micah Sloat) is sympathetic but clumsy, thinking his pricey new camera can capture her demons on film.It's a pretty silly concept and this highly hyped film can be tedious as we sit through repeated filmings of the couple asleep in the blue-gray light of their room. Admittedly, we tense up a little when we start to hear eerie noises around 2 AM, observe the bedroom door moving, and watch a catatonic Katie hovering over Micah's side of the bed.I'll also admit that apprehension mounts a little as Micah gets rough with the spectre, throwing the F word around and making taunts -- 'Have something to say in English this time?' while Katie vows to contact a demonologist. 'Tomorrow I'm making the call.' Ooooh, the spirit will get angry at these things!The last few minutes of the movie are indeed scary, as we observe Katie descend into madness and Micah meet an inexplicable end. (It's so easy to kill off characters; the writers' resorting to this is a very weak point in the plot.)I like what I've seen of found-footage movies, particularly 'Cannibal Holocaust' and 'The Blair Witch Project.' Despite referencing the latter, and paying homage to such horror epics as 'The Haunting,' this production is not in its predecessors' league.I think this film is best viewed as the portrait of an unfortunate soul who is tortured by a psychosis that 'doesn't care about alarms and locked doors.' 'You can't run from it,' a psychic advises. 'It wants Katie.'Katie never seeks help in a conventional way (i.e., by consulting a psychologist), and one does feel for her suffering. 'I don't want to be here,' she laments. 'I feel it breathing on me.' She can never escape herself and in the end that proves devastating. How sad to hear her words of surrender: 'I don't want to leave. I think it better if we stay.'",4,0,0,6 November 2019
Rosemary's Baby," Creepy tale of an abused, abandoned woman
","In this Christ story-turned-on-its-head, one definitely sympathizes with Mia Farrow as Rosemary.Her biggest sin is that she trusts her husband, Guy (John Cassavetes), who gets lured into a coven operating in the gothic Dakota building on Manhattan's Upper West Side before betraying her cruelly.Rosemary deals with the most egregious case of gaslighting since the 1944 movie that coined the term, as everyone from Guy to her celebrity OBGYN try to make her disbelieve her own painful perceptions. Her pregnancy occurs via rape by her husband. We know she's not off to a good start.The film starts out with many marks of the gothic horror tale, as Rosemary and Guy hear about sordid crimes that transpired in their new residence and are warned against moving in. In a manner echoed by 'The Blair Witch Project' several decades later, Rosemary and Guy scoff at an herb collection left by a former tenant.Coda: From the internet, a recipe for the Vodka Blush:

Joker," Give the man a stronger prescription!
","Here is a story about mental illness, society's ignorance of it, and the horrible price we pay for turning a contemptuous eye.As the movie begins, we sympathize with a floridly disturbed man who ekes out a living as a clown, getting ridiculed and abused at every turn. Played by a wiry, bare-chested Joaquin Phoenix, Arthur asks his state-assigned therapist for some more medication, but she doesn't really care about his case, and soon Arthur is running the streets, not really giving a fig, in his turn, about the mayhem he's about to wreak.When a trio of obnoxious Wall Streeters taunts Arthur on a subway, he sets off on a terrifying crime rampage fueled by the fantasy of love with a single mother who lives down the hall (Zazie Beetz). All of this takes place against the backdrop of a coarsening, anarchistic society that is reaping what it has sown.There is terror in 'Joker' because we never really know what's going on in Arthur's mind, yet we sense it isn't good. I think the movie falters a bit, and stretches itself out unnecessarily, by focusing too obsessively on Arthur's maniacal laughter and chain smoking. Why turn him into such a freak?The performances here are uniformly strong. Phoenix comes across as inscrutable, unpredictable, a human loose cannon. Also chilling is a plastic Robert DeNiro as talk-show host Murray Franklin, who gives Arthur a platform, not because he values him, but as fodder for his jibes.Franklin is blind to the perils of behaving so savagely. Let's hope our culture can learn something from his shocking fate.",6,1,5,30 December 2019
Parasite," Clever premise marred by conventional, sappy ending
","I became mildly interested in this movie when a student mentioned it in my horror-film class. However, I became skeptical when the film went all mainstream by snagging the Best Picture Oscar.I was right to be hesitant. This movie has some strengths, including its cinematography and stunning musical score, but its story line goes wildly astray in its second half.Here we have the story of an impoverished family of freeloaders who ingratiate themselves into the lives and home of a wealthy family. Just when it looks like they'll get away with their scam, everything is threatened by the return of the family's fired homemaker.At this point, the movie careens into thoroughly unlikely territory that is slightly reminiscent of recent horror movies like 'Get Out' and 'The Hostel.' There are indeed moments of high tension, such as when the family has to sneak out of the house when their hosts are sleeping nearby.A Noah's Ark-level rain shower and flood is good for its special effects but does nothing to advance the story.The movie's maudlin ending is the weakest part of the film. By the time the movie reaches its denouement the audience doesn't like what remains of the family and doesn't give a fig about its Morse Code messaging.To me, the ending seemed haphazardly slapped on because the producers didn't know how else to end this work. Anti-climactic to the max!",5,3,12,21 February 2020
Halloween," World of wanton, senseless murder
","Evil swoops out of nowhere and settles into middle America in this granddaddy of American slasher films.'Halloween' is nothing great, but it has several interesting elements in a terrain in which locks, doors, and windows can't protect.There is a highly predictable story here -- extending all the way to the movie's sequel-guaranteeing final frame -- and one can see the attacks by mute monster Michael Myers from a mile away.US slasher films were inspired by Hitchcock's 1960 classic 'Psycho,' and the Giallo genre of Italy, led by the likes of director Dario Argento ('Suspiria, 1977). 'Halloween' starts eerily with a flickering jack-o-lantern and a tinkling of piano keys highly reminiscent of the score from 'Suspiria.'The action transpires in white-picket-fenced Haddonfield, Ill., a place you'd never expect the mayhem that plays out. Early on, we zoom in on an English class, where foreshadowing arises from a literary theme: 'No matter what course he took, he was destined to his own fate.'Our protagonist is the real-life daughter of actress Janet Leigh of 'Psycho,' Jamie Lee Curtis, in her first major film role. Dressed as a dowdy schoolgirl, she does well in a very limited role.Tension does manage to mount as Laurie glimpses a boogeyman in such places as behind a flapping clothesline of wash -- or does she?I wouldn't have chosen to view this film, but it was presented as part of a course I am taking in the horror film. What IS scary is that 'Halloween' spawned so many sequels and imitators. What is it in audiences that prompts them to spend hard-earned dollars on such fare?",2,0,2,26 September 2019
Life," Space-age Frankenstein story
","Man's curiosity -- his greatest attribute or his worst flaw?This film tackles the dangers of pushing scientific exploration to its limit.
Scientists aboard the International Space Station accept a sample of soil from Mars and set about creating a medium in which a single-celled organism could spring to life. Back on Earth, humans' special brand of anthropomorphism prompts a school kids' contest in which the dormant creature is dubbed Calvin.'C'mon, Calvin, wake up!' an ISS scientist urges. He administers an electric shock of some sort, which the miniscule being interprets as an act of hostility.
And thus begins, yes, our home planet's very demise.This exceedingly grim but interesting and at times exciting film features a monster that looks like an inexorably growing, transparent squid. But the creature definitely manages to scare.The performances here are broadly sketched but manage to satisfy. And the space crew's slimy nemesis makes a certain amount of sense as we watch it exploit the humans' vulnerabilities -- from a scientist's palsied leg to the astronauts' selfless tendency to take risks to help one another.The film ends particularly effectively, once an escape pod has landed back on Earth, presumably in some remote expanse of the Pacific. The film challenges us to ask why we do what we do. Maybe we can. But SHOULD we?The movie ends aptly with the strains of Norman Greenbaum's 'Spirit in the Sky,' which, I read on Wikipedia, has been cited as the second-most-requested song to be played at memorial services.Will man's quest for knowledge become his funeral dirge? This film may leave you wondering.",6,1,3,17 April 2019
Contact," Bloated and incomprehensible
","I always dislike it when I have to go to Wikipedia to read the plot of a film so I can make sense of what I'm seeing.I did that early on with 'Contact,' a supercilious tale about brilliant scientist Ellie (Jodie Foster) and her quest to 'listen for' life beyond Earth. Once she finds it -- in the form of a 1930's broadcast of Hitler that has been beamed back to Earth from a star called Vega -- the film gets way too complicated and bogged-down to care about. I bailed out of this turkey once Ellie lands on some space body -- can you land on a star? -- and meets a wraith, or something, of her long-departed father. And this was supposed to have come from the erudite mind of Carl Sagan?The movie is strongest at its beginning, where we meet the younger, beyond-precocious version of Ellie (Jena Malone) and her widowed dad (Tom Morse), who encourages her love of ham radio and the stars. Aside from older Ellie's time at a lab in the Puerto Rican rain forest, I found older Ellie to be annoyingly one-note and shrill. in a movie that is three hours long, way too much is asked of the audience, with far too little payback.I'll admit the movie has a few good lines in its first third. 'If it is just us, it seems like an awful waste of space,' Dad tells younger Ellie. And how!'I think it's great that you listen,' a colleague in PR tells older Ellie. 'Most people don't do that anymore.'I'll admit the film has a couple interesting things to say about paternalism, pessimism, and mathematics -- 'the only universal language.' There is also an amazing bit of film editing that seems to show Bill Clinton, president when this movie was released, commenting on Ellie's discovery.",3,1,5,12 June 2020
