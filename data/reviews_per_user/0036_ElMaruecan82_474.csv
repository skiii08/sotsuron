The Devil's Advocate," Al Pacino pulling strings again, but not quite as a 'God' father
","'Can you imagine a world without lawyers?' The mere thought of happy people from all over the world dancing hand-in-hand in circle around a beautiful rainbow sent an immediate shiver down Lionel Hutz' spine. This classic moment from 'The Simpsons' pretty much sums up the connection people make between lawyers and evil. How can there be anyone making loads of money from a job that basically consists on raising doubt over the guilt of child molesters or war criminals? Of course, lawyers are the reincarnations of the devil! There's an ethical bunch that defends the widow and the orphan but Taylor Hackford makes no secret that his devil's advocate is no Atticus Finch.And Kevin Lomax, played by an underrated Keanu Reeves, is a hot-shot with as much ethics as Lionel Hutz. A young girl is just testifying against her teacher, Lomax sees his own client caressing his crotch, there's no doubt in his mind that the man is filth, his conscience is shaken so he asks to go to the bathroom, but when he comes back, you understand that it was just a moment of weakness, not realization. He knows exactly how to handle the situation and through a habile cross-examination, he gets the pedophile acquitted. Yet, we never really deem Lomax as a bad man, there's something about this young go-getter that doesn't fuse villainous vibes or the conviction that his cockiness will backfire at him, and that's integral to the film's appreciation. If we believed at the spot that he was the bad guy, the Faustian pact wouldn't have any dramatic weight.The film set him up as a Florida prodigy who never lost a case, his secret is a sixth sense that allows him to pick the right jury for the job, which is impressive enough to raise itself beyond 'evil' stereotyping. As for his background, he's a man who grew up without any father-figure (which excuses his cynicism), raised by a mother (Judith Ivey) whose devotion to religion feels more like overcompensation than bigotry, and married to a lively and beautiful girlfriend remarkably played by Charlize Theron. His last victory earns him a contract in a prestigious lawyer's cabinet in New York, he demonstrates his jury-picking skills and manages to win an unsolvable case, and in the process a high firm position in the cabinet. The film tells the wags-to-riches story with such gusto and an amazing attention to details highlighting wealth and power than we kind of enjoy it without really waiting for any supernatural elements. As a matter of fact, the title is a bit of a give-away.Indeed, is it spoiling the film to say that Al Pacino is the Devil? A simple look at the poster and a game of elimination will get you to the conclusion. And when John Milton, the CEO, makes his entrance, shakes hands with Lomax and takes him to the top of the building, where a sort of pool has been designed so that it looks like the edge of Niagara falls, we get an eloquent metaphor for Lomax' situation, like walking on a tightrope, with a man who can either take him to the summit or cause his downfall. Hackford's film is visually eloquent and creates such intriguing build-ups that the early jump scares are efficient. But as powerful as they are, a few of them aren't anticipated, and the film ventures in a territory we identify as familiar since we know the title and the main theme. It's not like Alan Parker's 'Angel Heart' which starts like a film-noir before descending into horror.But there's a certain delight within the anticipation of the thrills to come and to see poor Lomax' always only one step behind his wife until it hits him in the face. The escalation toward more and more disturbing revelations culminates with one of these moments where you realize that none other than Al Pacino can make the devil look so flashy and entertaining. De Niro was a creepy devil, but Pacino's angle is perfect for the film, he's a man who goes over the top, histrionic since that's a skill required for his job. That's the trick lawyers use and the essence of the devil, it doesn't guide you much as it whispers in your head all you need to make the wrong moves by yourself, it's all in pretending, in masking emotions and guiding the others through the desired reactions. It's all about spotting the Achille's heel and in Lomax' case, by his own admission, his ego is his biggest weakness, Vanity is his sin and for a puppeteer like Milton, it's the easiest string to pull.This revelation, while not a twist, reveals why we gave him the benefit of the doubt by pinpointing his real sin, through a flamboyant and operatic showdown between Lomax and Pacino who got (of course) the best lines and a few fiery tirades, to which Reeves reacts perfectly as the straight-man. While not reinventing the codes or providing anything in the same vein than 'Rosemary's baby' or 'The Exorcist', 'The Devil's Advocate' is less interested in providing horror thrills than revealing the depths of human propensity to endorse horror, and all in flash, a few substance, and some jump scares worthy of the best thriller.",7,1,2,11 August 2017
The King's Speech," An inspiring friendship story and one of the greatest screenplays of the last 10 years ...
","'The King's Speech' strikes by its unusual simplicity. Many films featuring royalty would have insisted so much on the royal aspect, they would have become a predictable exercise in grandeur. But this is not the case of Tom Hooper's brilliant achievement. On the contrary, there's an interesting feeling of intimacy as we're introduced in the little family within the Royal Family, with Albert Duke of York as the father, a man with a stammer and the future King George VI. The brilliance of the script is that the title is quite misleading, since it's less about a King than a normal man haunted by the omnipresence of his 'Kingness'. The Royal affiliation is the dramatic element that turns the stammer problem into a political issue, transporting us in a closed world where political and symbolic matters transcend the medical problem, and where a man is trapped between his desire of peace and such values as duty and responsibilities. This dilemma between pride and humility will govern Colin Firth's actions, as the tormented Albert, 'Bertie', future George of England, a dilemma structuring the narrative of one the greatest screenplays of the last 10 years.A great screenplay featuring dramatic and comedic situations, where the paradoxes of a man put so much pressure on his shoulders, it becomes comical. The man suffers from a big handicap making his position as a King totally grotesque, especially during the communication era. But he's lucky enough to be the brother of the King, played by Guy Pearce, as the infamous Edward VII who abdicated to marry a two-time divorced American women. All these historical matters are like a streak of bad luck for poor Albert, or 'Bertie'. This is the originality of the film, we have such a trivialization of a sacred figure and the most crucial events of the last century reduced to a practical problem, we forget about the whole King issue and strangely, the characters become more appealing. They become human, and the stammer problem a common handicap. Actually, the most despicable character is the one who, despite his distance with the Royal family, is still the more 'royal' of them, embodying the monarchy in its most decadent aspect. And as far as the story goes, we realize it's s not about a man who cured a stammering to be a respected king, but about a man who started to respect himself to cure his stammering, and appreciate his Kingness. It's about a man becoming himself.It's not George but Bertie's story. And the heart of the story is the relationship with Lionel Logue, his free-spirited speech therapist, with unorthodox methods, Geoffrey Rush delivering one of the most memorable supporting performances of the last years. I suspected a revelation that Lionel Logue had a stammer as a kid, but this would have been so obvious I was glad they didn't weaken an intelligent script with such an evident twist, a script's intelligence as one that respects ours. The interaction between Bertie and Lionel starts slowly, made of several leavings and come-backs, of moments of complicity and outbursts of anger, breakdowns, and profanities, not without provocations from Logue. Logue's wit and Bertie's temper are like the salt and the pepper that gives its taste to a movie that could have been perceived as too royally British, too serious, a taste of thrills and passion.The thrills come from those cruel blanks due to a physical inability to overcome this bloody nervousness that block the words. These moments of hesitations, false starts, gulping and teeth shaking noises, are as disturbing and chilling as those where the two bomb experts must choose which wire to cut. But the most touching aspect of the film is the friendship story. The challenge, medical in the beginning becomes personal when Logue realizes the origin of Bertie's problem is a nervousness driven by a low self-esteem. But Bertie instantly becomes George when Logue sits on his throne or insolently teases him, the stammer disappears. This is not about duality, it's about self-confidence, it's about communicating trust, and that's the ultimate proof of friendship. A friend isn't someone you spend a good time with, but one who's not forced to respect protocol or social barriers, therefore any outburst of anger from Bertie is a friendship blocker from the future King, and as long as Logue doens't talk to a King, we know they're friends.And this is the paradox of Albert, he doesn't want to become the King because of his stammer problem and wants to become the King not be perceived as the ordinary friend of a vulgar Australian. Not only he'll become the King but his very friendship will be the key to his problem. While he'll deliver one of the most engaging and moving climactic speeches in a movie, in the difficult context of the war, the King's speech, which inspired all the British people, he's just an ordinary man watching a friend smiling to him, while listened by his beloved family. And that's why it was a successful speech. Albert had to learn to be a friend to become a King, because being treated as a friend is to let himself go, to trust someone, to learn about trusting to trust his value, to let humility guide you to pride. 'The King's Speech' is the extraordinary story of an ordinary hero who overcomes his low self-esteem to meet his destiny, and a beautiful friendship story, too",10,2,3,17 February 2011
The Mask," Dr. Carrey, Mr. Mask ... and the cinematic tribute to the greatest cartoon director!...
","Along with 'Dumb and Dumber' and 'Ace Ventura: Pet Detective', Chuck Russell's 'The Mask' is part of that 1994 trinity that finally, and forever, put Jim Carrey in Hollywood map. He was certainly a successful and relatively known comedian before but I'm sure the size of his house and the relationship with his banker had considerably improved in 1995.And it was a deserved success, as only the big screen could do justice to this face-of-thousand-faces, to this extraordinary elasticity and capability to transform into a celebrity or to express any possible emotion, or both. Just look at Carrey becoming James Dean, it takes him a few seconds but it's like watching a live metamorphosis and the result is outstanding, he seems to have a rubber-made face that can use every single muscle. And when you see the two other movies, you realize that Carrey has elevated the word 'grimace' to the rank of high art, and that in fact, he didn't need the mask to be the Mask, still, he needed 'The Mask' to show that he was Carrey before the Mask.Indeed, the paradox of 'The Mask' is that it uses Carrey's talent with a device that is a green rubber mask and one of the first use of CGI to create Tex Avery-like special effects, and that premises gives the misleading impression that the faces Carrey makes are the results of special effects. Yet, this paradox helps the movies and Carrey's career as well, as it allows him to play a more human and appealing character than Ace Ventura and Lloyd Christmas. As the meek and shy Stanley Ipkiss, Carrey can let his more sensitive side being expressed and create a likable character in the same vein than Buster Keaton or Charlie Chaplin and let his Mask-counterpart act like Harpo Marx.Ipkiss is a timid bank clerk who's get bullied by everyone and he has no one to vent his anger on, he just comes back home, talks with his dog Milo and watches a few Tex Avery cartoons and envies the wolf's exuberance and liberty. It's like Jim Carrey wishing to be Jim Carrey. We finally have glimpses on a realistic facet of the actor's range and it does have a few serious undertones as it explores the traditional 'Dr. Jekyll and Mr Hyde' dual personalities theme with a sort of Faustian notion that there's a price to pay for being better by cheating, that it might lead to mayhem and a false impression of happiness. But he's only human and when he discovers that mask on the beach, he can't resist.And he has a taste on how it feels to live like a Tex Avery character and becomes one of the greatest creation of the 90's, a guy dressed in the typical zoot suit and act like a real version of Genie from 'Aladdin' with some of the obnoxiousness of Ace Ventura. Yet, there's no doubt that 'The Mask' is 100% original creation, and a source of gags and music like no comedy had provided since the Golden Age. The film is punctuated by great musical numbers, a magnificent Cuban party, a Konga with policemen and prostitutes, some impressions where Carrey can deliver his comical talent and so many unforgettable punchlines as 'Smokin'' or 'Somebody stop me!'.But if it wasn't just for a series of 'unstoppable' stunts, musical vignettes and other comedic numbers, the film would have quickly become redundant. There's also great performances, besides Carrey who, for once, is allowed to tone down his usual zaniness and shows a true vulnerability, and manages to look sweet and handsome. There's the scene-stealing dog, who has a great talent to read the lips, and it contributes to one of the film's best gags, totally lost in the original French version I saw and it tells something when the film's best gag doesn't involve the main character.And there is the love interest, played by Cameron Diaz, in a film debut kids who became teens in the mid-90's never forgot, I plead guilty as I remember having rented the VHS only for her entrance and the nightclub sequence. Diaz is amazingly sexy, sensual and beautiful as the equivalent of Tex Avery red-headed pin-up, it's not just the body but perhaps her smile that makes her so appealing, but Diaz just doesn't play the pin-up, she's as convincing in her acting as Carrey and even pulls out dramatic expressions when the situation requires it. Both Carrey and Diaz deserve credit for their performance, and the scene where they dance together is the greatest tribute to Tex Avery, and the film had me if only it gave tribute to my favorite cartoon director.It was 'no holds barred' with Tex Avery, but that's not true, Tex Avery cartoons, as crazy and nonsensical as they were, were not just successions of fourth-wall-breaking moments, mindless screams, wild explosions or chases that never added up to the plot, don't get 'The Whacky World of Tex Avery' and good old Tex Avery cartoons mixed, Avery was a storyteller, and 'The Mask' doesn't take its zaniness for granted and can afford a good plot with an obligatory antagonist, well-played by Peter Greene, a mid-90's figure who seems to have disappeared from the screen (he was Zed in 'Pulp Fiction' and Redfoot in 'The Usual Suspects'), an embittered cop with his jovial assistant, and a nice climactic confrontation where the Mask shows its limits, when worn by the wrong person or animal (Muttley-like-laugh) Indeed, it's better to act according to our true nature, and it doesn't take a mask to reveal who we are, in Ipkiss' case, the mask was just the catalysis for a new departure and for Carrey's career. I have a feeling ever since he started doing these comical roles, Carrey has tried to prove he was more an Ipkiss than a Mask, this shows how defining the movie is.",8,1,1,10 March 2016
Saturday Night Fever," The 70's youth needed a hero ... his name was Tony Manero ...
","Whenever you mention 'Saturday Night Fever', the image that immediately pops in your mind is John Travolta's sensual hips moving on the disco floor, a black and white suit, a gold chain with a cross in a hairy chest while his index points to the top, like a religious prayer to be the one and only, the Holy Spirit that inhabits the dance floor.Indeed, there is something divine whenever John Travolta moves. But it's like the film's iconic status distracted the viewers from Tony's complexities, as the movie was more an invitation to admire than to understand him, a shameful reality because he's probably one of the most fascinating and generation-defining characters of the 70's.And the most defining scene is, in my opinion, the first one that sets the mood of the film, with Tony swaggering down the street, with the unique sound of the Bee Gees' 'Stayin' Alive'. His cocky demeanor says it all, you really can tell by the way he uses his walk, he's a woman's man. And his smile, the way he shows off is so communicative that you don't even pay attention to the paint bucket in his hand, and feel there is something behind that charisma. A young man like Tony can't exude such virile magnetism if he wasn't inhabited by a 'strange power'. But the movie is a character study, it takes its time, it builds up the personality of Tony Manero by showing his job, his family, his friends, with a realistic touch that would have made proud Martin Scorsese. The macho culture prevails during the Italian dinner, where Tony seems to be the lowest element in the family ladder, crystallizing the anger of his unemployed father and her mother, whose love is almost exclusively dedicated to her older son, Franck, the priest of the Family, and the only good model.The irony in Tony is that he looks for models too, he idolizes charismatic figures like Bruce Lee, Al Pacino, or Rocky Balboa but outside the family, he's the idol, girls want to be with him and guys want to be him. And as the movie progresses, his interactions with all the supporting characters reveal a more complex side of his personality, he's more than a good dancer, a stud or a charming young man. Take the heart-breaking case of Annette for instance, she's so obsessed with Tony that she'd ultimately trade her self-esteem to go out, dance, have sex with him or his friends, to hurt him. The downfall of her pride is one of the sad back stories that enrich the film. But this is nothing compared to Joey who's cruelly portrayed as the anti-Tony Manero. He's shy, insecure, and his behavior and physical appearance diminish him even more. He's got a good-heart but cant find anyone to listen to him, to advise him, as the eternal good guy whose constant display of kindness earn him mockeries and pitiful indulgence. His tragic accidental death underlines the perverse side of the Brooklyn youth's life, leading to nowhere but frustration, and despair. When you know about Tony's environment, you definitely understand the deliverance incarnated by the dance floor.Tony literally resurrects in his territory and no one can challenge him, except maybe Pauline, a remarkable dancer on whom he flashes during the first Saturday night, she'd be the perfect partner for the dance contest, but Tony is visibly looking for something more personal. Pauline is a public relations employee and reveals herself to be the sort of pain-in-the-ass know-it-all girl, that whenever she has the opportunity, starts bragging about which celebrity she met or which compliment she received, provoking a defensive reaction from Tony who can't stand this snobbish attitude. Pauline basically wants to show, Tony wants to prove something to himself, this is the torment he endures. It's not about pleasing an audience, your parents, your friends, it's about self-esteem, which he curiously lacks.This irony is highlighted during the climactic sequence where, after a beautiful and romantic dance number, he and Pauline win, but despite the thunder of applauds, Tony hardly hides his disappointment as he knew the Puerto Ricans who danced after him did a better job. For Pauline, it doesn't matter; it's all about winning, showing. For Tony, winning must go along with deserving. This false victory is the proof of the hypocrisy that governs the rules, Tony won because he's the most charismatic, but he can't build anything on charisma, because it has nothing to do with his own merits. There's something profoundly romantic in Tony Manero, as the misunderstood guy who feels his popularity as painful weight on his shoulders that prevent him from improving himself. No one understood him, maybe not even some viewers who couldn't get why this guy isn't prouder of himself. I guess, because the character gains more maturity and realizes that it's easy to comfort yourself in a safe haven of popularity and get all the chicks, but nothing worth living for can be conquered easily.'Saturday Night Fever' is a deep introspective film that conveys the existential state of the 70's youth through a fascinating character, who'll get you a better appreciation of John Travolta's acting talents in this deservedly Oscar nominated role. In the same time, the movie is so driven by the disco music that it aged a little, it has some flaws too, but the same kind that you'd find in Marty's 'Mean Streets'. Overall, 'Saturday night Fever' deserves to be regarded as one of the greatest films of the 70's, and a classic among the classics.And an iconic status that would inspire a parody only three years later in the hilarious 'Airplane!', like so many great classics, 'Saturday Night Fever' features images forever engraved in our memories, with, like Simon and Garfunkel for 'The Graduate' 10 years before, a music that fits the spirit of the 70's like the white suit in Tony's gracious body.",9,1,3,6 July 2011
Moneyball," Moneyball-management or the odd ways to beat sports odds...
","'Moneyball', directed by Bennett Miller, respects the viewer's intelligence so much it elicits a rather unexpected non-emotional response towards sport. Sure it's one of these movies that are more about the business than the game and one thing for sure, the way odds never work as we expect is part of sports' beauty; still, the film isn't concerned about the beauty of the game.First, I'm not American, so although I've seen countless movies about baseball, the game is still total mystery for me. However, I know one thing or two about the laws of odds when it comes to sport and the particular mechanisms of sport business to understand the following: just because something is logical on the paper doesn't make it bound to happen on the field. Let's take an example in a sport I know a little better: football, or as Americans call it: soccer.Real Madrid had all the best players in the early 2000s: Zidane, Beckham, Figo and Raul to name these, it was their best team on the paper and yet from 2002 to 2006, before the Barça got Leo Messi, they didn't win the Spanish championship and they had to wait a whole decade before winning the Champions' League. Once again, all the boxes were ticked talent-wise but something was lacking in another department. And then they had Zidane as a coach for less than five years and they won the League four times, including a winning streak of three, a record. It couldn't be luck, it couldn't be the sole presence of Ronaldo who was there for at least five years before the first win, but something did catalyze his talent as well as the other players.This example proves that sports obey to certain rules that are less about reuniting than managing talents together and sometimes, winning isn't made of having the best players by any means but by getting the best game from any players. Because even a Real fan would admit that the Barça had the best team. So it's not just a matter of being the best and if you get that, you'll get 'Moneyball', a film that relates the 2001 2002 season when the Oakland A's beat the odds and broke a record of 20 consecutive victories thanks to a new unorthodox approach from the manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) and his right-hand man, Peter Brand, a nerdy expert in statistics played by Jonah Hill (both will be Oscar-nominated for their performances).The duo defies the traditional scouting methods (consisting on picking the players with the best ratio of financial accessibility and ratings) through a new statistical approach of the game based on Excel tables and a meticulous examination of past results and combined percentages. So they manage to form an unlikely dream-team with players who were constantly overlooked, including some who never dreamed to play again. The core-idea is that at the right time with the right combination of factors, any team can win,;it all comes down to create these factors... and convince the no-nonsense coach Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman) to let the players play.It takes a while to make this 'omelet' of victory and of course, it doesn't go without breaking a few eggs, and a few egos. Among the many things Brand learns about the business is to tell a player that they let him 'go' and the quicker he gets to the point, the better... nothing personal and strictly business. The catch of that (no pun intended) is that everything works like a business and makes Beane's situation antithetic to a certain vision of sports. The film gives us a few hints about his youth when he was a 'natural' (à la Redford) who had all the makings of a champion, who abandoned school to be a professional and for some reason, never really took off and became an infamous casting error.Beane's paradox is that he had personal reasons to make his team win, he wants to matter for baseball and yet the methods he pulls are so mathematical, so rigorous that he reminds me of that quote about Ace Rothstein in 'Casino' : 'he was so serious about it all that I don't think he ever enjoyed himself' And that might be the irony of Beane, he takes the business so damn seriously that he seems dispassionate about the 'playing', only the outcome matters. It says a lot that he doesn't even watch the games. Pitt plays a paradoxical character whose hate for loss is stronger than his love for the game, which makes all the victories feel good and gratifying but not quite emotionally rewarding.'Moneyball' was written by Aaron Sorkin and Steven Zaillan and you can feel both the cold/methodical approach and the human/character study touch, at the end, we have someone so serious about his job he doesn't enjoy it a bit. And Pitt has a way to play these characters who seem detached even from things they supposedly enjoy; that he's divorced doesn't even surprise... if he handled his marriage with Robin Wright like he did with baseball. At the end, the only person who seems to bring genuine love and fun is his daughter (Kerry Dorsey), which shows the only facet of his life that isn't made of regrets and dreams of revenge.Now, the film is based on a true story, which means it couldn't afford a different ending, but talk about irony in the end, we don't get the limits of Beane's approach of victory, but of 'personal' victory, as an individual, not a manager. In fact, the ending proves him both right and wrong, and remind that just because you get the recipe doesn't make you a good cook for all that, and after all, even Zidane is struggling right now with Real Madrid.'Moneyball' addresses audiences used to sports archetypes to better subvert them and through its philosophy of winning, it manages to create a rather uninspiring and depressing movie about underdogs, which is quite an achievement story-wise.",8,2,3,31 December 2019
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Thank you, Master Tarantino for the 'Kill Bill' series ...
","'Kill Bill Vol. 1' ended with the revelation of The Bride's daughter being alive and this last shocking finale couldn't have made us wait three years for a conclusion, it was a 'to be continued' ending inviting for a direct continuation that would also feature elements preceding the first Volume and completing it with a necessary level of depth. So, to call 'Vol. 2' a sequel or a prequel is irrelevant, as the two movies make one, and constitute Quentin Tarantino's greatest cinematic achievement after 'Pulp Fiction'.Creativity is like a second skin for Tarantino, it's amazing how each chapter exudes a unique atmosphere. 'Vol. 2' never ceases to amaze us when we already got our share of adrenalin and emotions in the first opus, and I think the secret is very easy to spot, it's somewhat located in your heart and it's the ability of Tarantino to touch you right there. Action is one thing, but the movie excels even more in its portrayal of the motives that drives the action. And one recurring element in 'Kill Bill Vol. 2' more than any other, is the repetition of flashbacks whether shown or told, lengthy or furtive. The whole chapter involving the initiation with Pai-Mei is a great homage to the traditional Martial Arts films, and another enrichment of our knowledge about the Bride, finally known as Beatrix Kiddo, and the relationship with her Master. This aspect is crucial not only to justify her use of a special move to get out of a coffin, but also during the sword-fight when Elle Driver reveals how she killed Pai-Mei, indirectly informing us how she lost her eye. This fight closes the character's arc of Elle Driver and makes the revenge even more delectable, the 'Kill Bill and the Squad' thing getting a bit old.The fascinating aspect is how the film relies on the psychological element as Bea doesn't have the monopoly of motives. When we finally discover Bill, we have some insights about the significance of his acts. In the first flashback, Bill promises not to be a 'killjoy', but there's something odd in that whole chapter. Again the editing of the scenes helps the narrative in an decisive way, if the massacre had introduced the whole series, we would have been terribly shocked. But now that we know what a killer the Bride is, there's something disappointingly odd to see her, in a lousy chapel with these giggling chicks, and that blonde-haired schmuck for a husband. Something doesn't feel right. I'm not saying we would have rooted for Bill, but at least understood him. The last conversation between Bill and Beatrix goes even further in the development of Bill, proving how a fascinating character he is, and a suiting villain for such a heroine like Kiddo.The masterstroke in the screenplay is the serum truth, a poetical device to be sure that we all get everything, after all, the Volume 2 is here to conclude, to answer the questions without asking others. And we understand that Bea left Bill because she wanted to spare her daughter from growing under a bad influence, which quite justify Bill's anger, who thought his protégée was dead. On the other hand, Bea knew she was lying to herself with that wedding thing. So there are three truths in the Kill Bill series. First, you cannot escape from your past. Bill had to be back, and Bea's lies ignited his anger and caused the massacre. Secondly, you cannot escape from revenge, Bill's brother, Michael Madsen as Budd, knew it, and says in a poignant brotherly discussion that all the squad deserves to die. And third, you cannot escape from your nature, Bea was a killer, and the whole revenge against Bill let her express her most innate violent impulses  and as she conceded, the blood poisoned by the truth serum, she enjoyed those killings. The tragedy of Bea is that her nature as a killer inspired her, in a motherly protective move, to get B.B., her daughter, away from Bill. And seeing her shooting for fun, senselessly talking about a dead fish or watching 'Shogun Assassin' to get sleepy says a lot about Bill's education.The depth in 'Kill Bill Vol. 2' allowed the climax to be more meaningful, Bea had to kill Bill, less for the chapel massacre than to protect her daughter. The reasons changed and so did the fight style. When we expected another blood-fest, the climactic fight begins and ends abruptly with the five point palm-exploding heart technique that catches Bill and us by surprise. Bea didn't tell that Pai-Meei taught her the technique, why? Because she's bad, or just because she, like any others, wants to win the fight, and it's the perfect ending, as we tasted enough blood to rather appreciate an emotional farewell. The next morning, we find Bea with B.B. in a motel. This time, BB doesn't watch 'Shogun Assassin' but a simple cartoon, showing that things are changing for the better. And in the bathroom, Beatrix cries with an euphoria that sounds like the hangover following the blood-drunkenness provided by so much killings, or was it just the after-effect of the truth serum? Never mind, she joins her daughter to let us breath and celebrate the happy ending of a glorious saga.The ending credits reminds us that what we've seen is just a movie, a homage to a genre ... but what a movie! what a colorful gallery of characters who penetrated our Pop Culture memories : The Bride, Bill, O'Ren, the Crazy 88, Pai Mei  'Kill Bill Vol 2' is an extraordinary homage to the worshiped Martial Arts genre with some Neo-western elements, there's this agonizing feeling of an end approaching, and the creative destruction incarnated by the Bride piercing the coffin as to prove once and for all, that these genres are not dead, Tarantino as God-like 'CineMaster' resurrected them.",10,3,6,31 July 2011
Vertigo," A Haunting Masterpiece ...
","'Vertigo' draws a thin line between reality and our subconscious haunted by ghostly memories and tormenting traumas, and on this tightrope we wonder whether we should jump to wake up from that madness-embracing nightmare, or plunge into that magnificent meditative sky, or simply walk and walk trying not to faint from dizziness, or like James Stewart, not to succumb to acrophobia, translation: fear of heights.Speaking of heights, 'Vertigo' tops any other creation from the Master. Even Hitchcock's greatest films are never flawless, but 'Vertigo' flirts with perfection. More than a captivating thriller gripping your heart from one mystery to another, with every pieces of the puzzle reassembling at the end for a spectacular finale, the movie has a unique quality rarely displayed in Hitchcock's films with such intensity, I'm speaking of course of the torrid romance between the private-eye John 'Scottie' Ferguson and Madeleine Elster, his old friend's wife whom he must follow to understand the reasons of her peculiar behavior. Madeleine is portrayed by Kim Nowak whose breath-taking inner beauty surpassed the most beautiful panoramic shots of San Francisco, masterfully sketched by the Master.Indeed, the casting of Kim Nowak is extraordinary as she really looks like the kind of women that would obsess us and as usual, James Stewart's ordinary look makes him on the save wavelength as the audience. We identify with him while the internal focus creates a very disturbing empathy as much as a constant desire to understand Madeleine, while she visits the mysterious grave of a Spanish girl named Carlotta Valdes, and contemplates her painting while Scottie follows, or shall we say, contemplates her too. Kim Nowak's eyes communicate something desperate and affecting as we want to grab her, but at the same time, she's like totally inaccessible floating in a cloud of divinity, fragile and perfect, her vulnerability inspires Scottie's strength, and her lips with a bright red suggesting a bleeding heart and these sensual and haunting eyebrows, well, such a divine beauty can only inspire a genuine devotion Never had a chemistry been so intense and so passionate, it's not the first romance featured in a Hitchcock's film but this time, it works for the same reason it didn't, in my opinion, between Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint in 'North by Northwest' or even James Stewart and Grace Kelly in 'Rear Window'. It worked because it wasn't a conventional subplot but an important and relevant element of the story: hadn't they loved each other, never the guilt would have tormented both of them after the famous scheme. And everything happens is such a genuine way, Scottie spontaneously rescued her from the unforgettable suicidal scene in San Francisco Bay, the way their passion grows as she reveals her possession by the soul of Carlotta Valdes, only a man haunted by a traumatic guilt could understand this feeling.'Vertigo' is about guilt as a force that either blocks you or drives you, to a point it can be exploited to commit a crime, and as a double-edged sword, can help to solve the same crime. Scottie suffers from acrophobia since the day he indirectly caused the falling of a cop who came to rescue him. The iconic silhouette falling into the spiral is the allegory of the psychological guilt that tortures Scottie, and resurrects when he's at heights, making him incapable of moving, and as he proved it, of helping someone in danger. The directorial genius of Hitchcock is to have communicated this unsettling feeling by inventing the iconic 'Vertgio' shot, magnifying the background while zooming out, in the iconic tower scene. We really feel Scottie's dizziness. The whole story is told from his perspective, marvelously and meticulously constructed from that patient set-up that intrigues us and captivates us about Madeleine, to her apparent death, and then her mysterious reappearance. As we wonder, if we're not haunted too, by the ghost of Madeleine too, the immersion is total.The psychological aspect of 'Vertigo' is one of the key elements that places 'Vertigo' among the greatest films. Scottie is such an endearing character, trying to conceal many wounds in his heart, with his own weaknesses unfairly exploited. There's another interesting character as the ex-fiancée Midge, who tries to reach Scottie, in vain. She tells the only cure for the acrophobia would be another shock, but there was something more powerful, boiling in Scottie's heart, a quest of redemption that would have probably inspired Scorsese. And when Scottie rediscovers the identical twin of Madeleine, as Judy Barton, and tries to make her look like Madeleine, there's something touching in Nowak's distraught attitude. She accepts everything from Scottie, tormented by the desire to reconstruct the sincere romance, or to redeem herself, because she fooled him.But fate wanted Judy to betray herself with one necklace that belonged to Carlotta, and in one flashlight of realization, Scottie understood the whole 'plot', and decides to change the program and go back to the tower. Scottie stops being a follower, a passive character, he acts, and finally gets the truth from Judy, and when they finally embrace, in one ironic twist that would haunt cinematic memories for eternity, the film starts like it ended, with Judy falling to her death, frightened by the shadow of a nun, who came to ring the mission bell. The sight of Stewart in the top of the tower is the triumph of a man who overcame his handicap through an emotional shock that cost him the life of his precious love, what an irony, what a finale and what a film! 'Vertigo' elevates us to a unique universe with the hypnotic beauty of a Kandinsky's painting and the alienating psychological torment of a Kafka novel, the whole chef-d'oeuvre orchestrated by the Maestro Bernard Herrman. 'Vertigo' is purely and simply, Hitchcock's Masterpiece with a major M and a major H, like in Haunting",10,2,4,19 July 2011
Black Swan," Body Thrilling, Emotionally Engaging and Spiritually Elevating ...
","I don't often use the word 'perfect' but this movie is perfect, Aronofsky is a genius and Portman the greatest actress born in my decade  It's been an eternity since I haven't lived such a unique experience  proving that cinema still means something, as it can inject such emotions in your skin you feel like living inside the character, which was the message: you don't play someone, this is a myth, a lie, you have to embody the character, to live him, to feel it deeply in your skin, your soul. Even the simple use of 'watcher' to describe my position is an absurd understatement.Whoever 'watched' this film, missed it, or was probably so disturbed by the images of skin scratching, bleeding, self-destruction to understand that these were NOT the expression of Aronofsky's sadistic tendency to betray our visions with indelicate pictures, not expected from a gracious dance-themed movie, but were meant to enlighten our minds that perfection is self-destruction, annihilation of a destructive duality for a total soul dedication to the purpose to our inner 'Black Swan', this something that no one, not our friends, not our parents, can extract from us, and only we have the power to achieve the dream or destroy it. We are our own ally or worse, our own enemy; to get rid of this psychic duality is the key for salvation. And if self-destruction is salvation, it's still better than insignificant normality.The intelligence of 'Fight Club', the upsetting graphicness of 'The Wrestler' with a kind of Bergmanian grace inhabiting the philosophy of the film, were carried by one of the greatest female performances I've ever watched. No, I didn't even watch Portman, I was Portman, I was this fragile little woman struggling to beat her inner demons and become the 'Black Swan', I was her when she was losing her balance while carried by that bastard who didn't realize he was holding the purest incarnation of the most famous ballet character ever. I was her, when she fell, I felt the pain, I couldn't even watch the audience, her face while crying behind the curtain was like a mirror. Never had a movie made me feel like a character in such an empathic way, forget gangsters, forget tormented anti-heroes, Nina Sayers is the greatest cinematic creation of the last 10 or 15 years.How to put it? I have no music, no sound to emit, I have no grace, no movements, words seem so futile to describe a movie showing how the best medium of human soul is movements, transported by played or inner music  think about it, even the greatest instrument player owes his virtuosity to repetition, a total time dedication, but the real gift is the one of the composer like Tchaikovski who did the immortal and haunting 'Swan Lake' music. Artistic talent is virtually nothing when you think about it, inspiration, technicality and repetitions, but creating through written notes or body movements, is another matter, you can repeat the same movements one million times, you won't embody the soul and the spirit of your character until you get your character, and to get is to become him, and to become him is to live him Nina lives the story of the 'Black Swan', everybody got the parallel, no need to write a thesis about it  But why did she live like the character? Because she was BORN to play the swan and this privilege was her doom. She lived and perished by the swan, and she became the Black Swan when she got rid of that ounce of fragility that controlled her, that made her so white  and made this dark side communicating aggressively through self-destruction, which was nothing than a destruction from a part of her eager to explode and let the whole passion burst out. Thomas Leroy, magnificently played by Vincent Cassel, looked through the glass and tried to help Nina but only Nina could have made the black swan finally fly.The images are nightmarishly disturbing, but they are an eloquent illustration of the violence we apply to ourselves, that's how we act, when our quiet part tries to put out the flame of our most burning impulsions, these hidden imperfections that actually best define us  Nina's soul was fragile because it was trying to keep balance between work and talent, when the point was to loosen up, trying to play, to enjoy the dance, to be more like Lily, Mila Kunis in a performance that totally blew me away Lily catalyzes all the fear that govern Nina's actions, being dethroned, being the white swan, hence, half a swan, half of Nina, which is nothing, since the perfect is made of everything  Lily was a danger because she was whitening Nina's darkest soul, like the overprotective mother, Beth, the ex-star, all these characters that made her repeat that pathetic whitening catchphrase : 'I'm so sorry!', the whiter she was, the more desperate was her situation and I felt it, the fall was her downfall, and the solution a constructive destruction through a spiritual union with that black swan, killing her by becoming her ... but what a rewarding self-destruction, what an intense scene of metaphorical resurrection when Nina became the Swan.This self-absorption was magnificently illustrated in the most sensual sex scene I've ever seen, the film already had strong sexual connotations but Lily and Nina's scene was the climactic expression of our fascination by the dark side, god why are all the sensuality and pleasures in the devil's side. After all, we're both angels and devils, we're black swan and white swan, we're Nina and Lily  and perfection, is total embodiment, which implies destructive but creative fusion Sara Goldfarb's constructed an image to ultimately destroy herself, Nina Sayers destructed herself to reach perfection, she's dead but immortal, and my haunted cinematic soul will mourn her forever",10,9,17,16 February 2011
Scarface," The masterpiece that defines the 80's and the Gangster genre ...
","Did you say 'overrated'? Really? Are you serious? You mean 'Scarface': the movie with zero Oscar nominations, and a Razzie nomination for Brian De Palma as worst director, the movie which many pseudo cinematic purists constantly denounce the 'all flash and no substance'-ness, its new popularity among gangsters rappers, Al Pacino's over-the-top performance, a laughable script and so on and so forth... you mean THIS movie is overrated??? Sorry man, but if one thing, this movie is absolutely and criminally underrated! And its iconic status, its place in IMDb Top 250, and tenth position in the American Film Institute's Top Ten Gangster films, are only the kind of justices that cinematic Gods have owed this masterpiece for a long time.Yes, 'Scarface' is a masterpiece, because it precisely didn't try to be one and the result is not unintentional either: the writing, the direction, the acting, everything points out a deliberate will to create an entertaining gangster flick. But I'm not sure Oliver Stone, Brian De Palma and Al Pacino expected this movie to become one of the most revered, quoted and of course, emblematic of the gangster genre, yet it did. Why? One word: guts, the kind of guts that break the walls and rhyme with balls. This movie had it. It's made of the same vein of classic pre-Godfather gangster flicks such as 'Little Caesar', 'The Public Enemy' and of course, the original 'Scarface : the Shame of a Nation', Hawks' classic to which this film is dedicated. Scarface has the virile magnetism and rebellious detachment of these films mixed with the exuberant flamboyance of the 80's. Not kitsch, not dated, the film couldn't have had a better setting, it's all about posing and showing off richness and power, it's a success story made during a time were it was indeed glorified.This is the thought-provoking 'guts' of 'Scarface' and why the film deserves its comparison with its more mature and respected predecessor: 'The Godfather'. 'Scarface' is to the 80's what Coppola's film was to the 70's: a reference, if not a milestone. It brought something new, assuming a dazzling celebration of the gangster world appeal without the preachy morality of the 30's or any attempt of glamorization. Every single character is depicted as an unredeemable scumbag and that was before 'Goodfellas' and 'Pulp Fiction'. They're not totally unlikable or amoral either, they're just victim of their own vision of succeeding the easy way.Because 'Scarface' literally pushes a certain idea of the American Dream to its bloodiest limit, to taste freedom and capitalism until getting an indigestion, to live the drunkenness of power until an ultimate hangover  so what did you expect the movie to be: a romantic Shakespeare tragedy à la 'Godfather' or a realistic epic drama à la 'Goodfellas'? No! The approach was right, it had to be a gripping fantasy about the Gangster world. It was naturally bashed by the critics, but at least, it could exorcise all the violence, and whatever was appealing in the lives of gangsters, with an acid but so flamboyant portrayal of the American Dream, before the same subject would be handled by a more tormented and cerebral Scorsese. Using a Scarfacian metaphor, the film is like a great sex with a painful orgasm.How dare you blame the portrayal of Tony Montana, for being over the top? The guy is a thug suffering from a Napoleon Syndrome?! All he got in Cuba was an experience of being beeped by communism, which all naturally, encouraged him to change the position in the only country that could allow that, a country neighboring his homeland enough to be the object of a cult with a view of freedom, money and prosperity so idealistic it twisted his morality. Tony wanted the American Dream in an excessive way, because that's all the way he viewed America, as a fantasy, It had to be a fantasy from the eyes of an emigrant, an emigrant who dreamed of driving beautiful cars, having his mansion with his initials graved in his chair and of course  getting the blonde.He wanted the world, and everything in it. He wanted money and power. And now you blame him for being over the top? Would you blame Norma Desmond to be too theatrical? Or Jack Torrance to be too weird? Tony Montana is a caricature only to those who can't see how caricatured the way the image of USA could be reflected, and to those blind people, De Palma even conceded that the movie's portrayal of Cubans wasn't reflecting blah blah, as if we needed to know that  come on, over the top? It's a movie and a damn entertaining one, whose 'over-the-top'-ness is the extra depth the haters fail to see .And the script, is probably one of the most memorable elements of the films. It drops so many F bombs, it's almost a punctuation mark creating delightful situations where we see Tony interacting with his sidekick, Steven Bauer as the unforgettable Manny, or his soon-to-be ex-boss, with his friends and enemies, until facing some anger management issues  Many people said it was Pacino's downfall, I think this was his rebirth, the new Pacino in his 40's, and his greatest role after Michael Corleone. The proof of Pacino's incredible talent is his ability to portray a range of gangster from Mafia boss to thug, in such a natural way, I'm sure he's an unsung icon to many criminals in the world. The script is just a verbal ode to the violence portrayed in this film, a violence that will leave red stains in your TV screen until it dirties your nice pajama  a violence reminding that for every fortune criminally earned, there is a Damocles sword upon your head waiting for a fatal mistake.So call it violent, over-the-top, dated, flashy  I say, 'Yes, man'g!' and this is precisely why 'Scarface' is a masterpiece !",10,2,4,3 May 2011
Love and Death," Good mourning, Mr. Allen ! ...
","Only three things are infinite : the Universe, human stupidity and Woody Allen's comical genius ...I love 'Love and Death' to death because it's the quintessential example of the boundlessness of humor, a sort of irreverence that equals the genius of the other period comedy made the same year: 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail'. Yet, there's something more appealing in 'Love and Death', a sort of endearing quality in the main character, Sergei Dimitriovitch, brilliantly portrayed by Woody Allen supported by a superb performance from Diane Keaton as the delicious, frivolous and voluptuous Sonja. I never thought Kay Adams could be so damn sex... I mean, funny.Sure, Woody plays the usual neurotic and tormented character but combined with the period setting and the picaresque narrative, it immediately provides a hilarious twist. He's insecure, weak, short, ugly, in a way, he makes us feel superior or luckier, but as the movie progresses, and as we get deeper in his subconscious, we're contaminated by his endless questionings about the meaning of life. Woody Allen's 'Love and Death' takes very seriously the humor it uses to make fun of seriousness, and the inner intelligence of the film relies on the level of absurdity it shamelessly reaches while tackling metaphysical subjects such as love, death, life, sex, and turning them into the most pleonastic derision. Ultimately, Woody Allen's epic period masterpiece resonates as the triumphant intellectual demonstration that life is damn too serious to be taken seriously, life is about living, enjoying, having fun, sex Disguised in cowardice and refusal to make war, Sergei's approach is in fact more hedonistic and inspirational in its intelligent demonstration that even for the average schmuck, the greatest things can work out of a misunderstanding!But misunderstanding implies the use of intelligence, and if there's no better comedy than a comedy with a heart, there's no funnier comedy that one with intelligence. And the mightiest power of intelligence relies on its capacity to exceed its idiomatic limits and idiotic means to defy the great law that defines our existence: absurdity. 'Love and Death' echoes the philosophical condition of our limited intelligence that can only bow to the all-powerfulness of God, and the infinity of the Universe and smell the stinking feet of our mortal condition. But instead of crying over that defining reality, Allen teaches us to laugh about it. Laugh is the mourning of truth's death. And no mourning could be more glorious than the joyful ballet between Woody Allen and the white-draped Death with the catchy music of Serge Prokofiev, highlighting with a prodigious harmony the cheerful nature of Death, as the ultimate way to get rid of all the torments inherent to life, now, cynicism has never been so deliriously funny! Woody indeed never rhymed so well with funny, at the pinnacle of his comedic period, after 'Take the Money and Run' or 'Bananas', before his films would rely essentially on homages, especially to Ingmar Bergman. Woody would never be funnier, which is not saying much because this is one of the funniest films ever. Sergei is naturally comical as a living anachronism with his modern existentialist questions, one century and half before this thinking would be developed by Sartre and Camus, not to mention his trademark black horn-rimmed glassed. The whole film is a delightful experiment on the countless possibilities to make people laugh. Slapstick comedy à la Keaton and Chaplin, wisecracking jokes à la Groucho Marx, naughty and vulgar humor à la Mel Brooks, everything deliciously enrobed with a Comedia Dell' Arte grandeur and decadence. And still with this unique Allenian feel, as he successfully transcends his comical abilities and make you laugh from the most unlikely intelligent stuff, and somewhat, we get the intelligence of his script more efficiently through the medium of humor, the genius of 'Love and Death' is that we may get more from Bergman through THIS film, than the movies it supposedly make laugh of. Think about this : 'To laugh is proper to man. To make someone laugh is to awake the most humanistic side of his nature. Intelligence is proper to man, too. To laugh is to be intelligent. But nonsense makes laugh, therefore, nonsense inspires intelligence. Nonsense is intelligence when it awakes the most humanistic side of his nature. But to makes laugh, nonsense requires intelligence, intelligence inspires nonsense. Yet intelligence condemns nonsense, and then nonsense condemns nonsense. Defining nonsense is depriving it from its essence, therefore its existence, and what exists through its non existence defies the notion of truth and reason. Nonsense is absurd. But what is absurd is funny. Absurd makes laugh. Absurd is proper to man. Nonsense is proper to man. Quod Erat Demonstrandum.'Of course, everything you read doesn't make sense, but it does obey to a certain logic that governs our intelligence, the quest for a meaning. All the purpose of humanity, of the philosophers who passed this world was to find a meaning, to end up with the same conclusion: that there's no proper conclusion, no possibility to reason with the human condition without getting confused or mixed up with so many frustrating concerns. If one must accept the existence of God, he should accept whatever God gives him, including the free will that allows him to doubt His existence: 'Knowledge implies doubt, doubt inspires knowledge and vice versa, knowledge constructs intelligence, enough intelligence to get the absurdity of the world. To build knowledge to deconstruct the world. That's the essence of absurdity' And Woody Allen raises above the absurdity of our world a masterpiece of pure hilarity, proving that if he's not the Eisenstein (God forbid his glasses were ever broken), he's surely the Einstein of film-making!",10,2,3,15 September 2011
Frost_Nixon," David Frost vs. Goliath Nixon ...
","There's a brief but memorable moment in 'Frost/Nixon' where one of Nixon's most ardent haters, a researcher played by Sam Rockwell, is about to confront for the first time the man he holds responsible for the destruction of American ideals. This is his time to shine and honor his opinions by not shaking the 'Shakers' hand. Yet, despite a brief hesitation, he gives both hand and respect. That says it all, there's the politician, there's the man, and one of the greatest tricks a corrupt one ever pulls is to hide behind the mask of friendliness.No one can resist it, much less a TV audience. In my student's essay about the power of media -which is the film's essential theme- I wrote that the camera not only changes perceptions but actions too. As long as there is an instance of mediation between two people, something will cease to be natural, and the talent of those who control the media is to make it imperceptible. So, when Frost (Michael Sheen) decides to interview Nixon, with his own money because no American channel will accept to pay a British interviewer, he gives the fallen President a golden opportunity to talk to American people. Nixon (Frank Langella) advised by Swifty Lazar (Toby Jones) accepts the challenge, a TV show will reach the people quicker and simpler than a memoirs book.It all comes to this : either Nixon shows a new shining image three years after the Watergate and his disastrous resignation, the only one in History, or Frost confronts a man to his responsibilities and forces him to admit his guilt. That's what Frost's partner John Birt (Matthew McFayden), Bob Zelnick, a TV journalist (Oliver Platt) and James Reston, Jr. (Rockwell) expect from the interview, anything but making Nixon sympathetic. With these opposite challenges, the premises could be that of a boxing match. And 'Frost/Nixon' is indeed a duel (the slash is relevant) with no holds barred between huge and flawed egos, starting with Frost, a cocky womanizer trying to forget that he was basically exiled in Australia to host forgettable entertainment shows, the refusals from TV studios to sponsor his project will finish to teach him lessons of humility.But Nixon plays in another league, being the epitome of 'unpopular culture', a tragic figure who destroyed what were left of American dreams, including his own. In 1995, Oliver Stone offered a remarkable view on Nixon, with no concession. Still, we couldn't help but feeling sympathy for a man entrapped by both his ideals and demons. The movie was remarkably served by Anthony Hopkins' performance but now, I wonder if it doesn't have something to do with the personality of Nixon himself, ambivalent to the best, with this mix of fascination and repulsion only great men achieve to inspire. Maybe he was the last 'larger-than-life' President. Anyway, he's not an amateur and during the interview, he's like Goliath ready to frost David.Goliath Nixon also has a redoubtable right-hand man (Kevin Bacon) who works as an adviser and he knows himself the traps of TV, he whose sweating under the upper lip cost him the Presidential campaign in 1960, so he wouldn't make the same mistakes. David Frost IS the rookie and when the first interview (we might as well call it a round) starts, Frost bluntly opens with the Watergate 'why didn't you burn the files?' Nixon is startled first but uses the question to pose as a victim of a system supported by his predecessors. Trying an uppercut, Frost was literally knocked down, tasting the toughness of an opponent who meant business. And as viewers, we're satisfied to see Frost put in his place for a moment, before he could recover.The measure of the thrills provided by the interviews is because both have everything to win, yet so much to lose. Nixon is in a dead-end and any attempt to gain his popularity back is welcome, and by throwing himself in that crazy project, Frost lost his show, 600 000 dollars and jeopardized his career, maybe more and I'm not sure his newly conquered girlfriend, Caroline Cushing (Rebecca Hall) would've stayed longer with him. In her one shining moment that doesn't rely on her distractingly beautiful looks, she notices that Frost doesn't like being questioned. And that weakness shows with Nixon's offensive remarks before the interview, destabilizing him on his effeminate shoes or his 'masculine attitude' with Caroline. No holds barred indeed, the two men bet a lot in this interview, and it's like two destinies crossing one another.The remarkable thing about Ron Howard's movie is that we all know it ended with a heartfelt confession from Nixon, one of the most memorable and defining TV moments of the 70's. But it's all in the process, on how Frost will finally take the edge over Nixon and find the vulnerable spots, or use his adversary's weapons against him, not through cynicism or aggressiveness but the true belief that his project is fair and for once, the variety show producer must act like a journalist. A man who failed as journalist must not interview the one who failed as a President. And this is why they were so close, yet so different from each other.It is between the two men and the others are only spectators, filling the film with many interesting comments about the evolution of the match, and what lessons they learned from the confrontation. A man should feel important enough to believe in his rightness but never such as he can escape from his responsibilities. The lessons served both men, and the ending is twice happy as each one seemed to have triumphed over his demons. Sometimes, truth hurts, but how relieving it can also be!",9,3,3,14 July 2015
Howl's Moving Castle," However painful it is to write this, but this time, Miyazaki indulged to self grandiosity...
","I'm glad that Hayao Miyazaki reconsidered his decision to retire otherwise his 2004 'Howl's Moving Castle' would be his last movie I'd experience and well, you got it, it wasn't as pleasant as the previous ones. I watched it three times, as I used to because his movies tend to be rich content and form wise so the two aspects can distract one from another, but then checking some other users' comments, I stuck to my initial reaction: the animation is as great as you can expect from the master but it's one of these cases where, paraphrasing Emperor Joseph from 'Amadeus', you can just sigh and say there are simply too many 'notes'.Don't get me wrong, it's not a case of Emperor with no clothes, but with so many clothes you can't even recognize him anymore. But I had my reservations from the beginning because the title reminded me of 'Castle in the Sky' and that film didn't leave me ecstatic either, an action-packed coming-of-age story, puppy romance with environmentalist and anti-war messages venturing in the realm of magic led to a real overdose of effects not easily 'digestible' by a younger audience. The film is still just a lighter version of 'Howl's Moving Castle', a real 'fantasy' bouillabaisse and perhaps the unique instance where a point came I stopped to care about the film and was waiting for it to end.Was it because Miyazaki was so intoxicated by the universal (and deserved) acclaim of 'Chihiro's Travel' that he felt he could fly that close to the sun and get away with it, there was just something a tad pretentious in that late-minute eruption of fantasy and witchcraft. And yet it started so promisinglyI just loved the quiet beginning in that small European town, I figured the action took place during World War I, then it started with a meek and mousy milliner named Sophie who's saved from two bullying soldiers by a handsome flying 'angel' named Hauru (the titular Howl) and then you have your set-up for a typical Miyazaki journey, a young female candidate for a great coming-of-age story, flying, magic and war as the backdrop. Then the troubles begin: a cruel sorceress named the Witch of the Waste turns Sophie (for no apparent reason) into an old woman and not only we've had to say goodbye to the pleasant look of Sophie to (yet another) ugly looking grandmother. What's with Miyazaki and old women anyway?Still, the real problem is that the personality of Sophie changes as well, in fact, it changes so radically that she becomes like another character. This might be the most disturbing thing about the film, all through her adventure; the changes in Sophie's looks and personality are so inconsistent that I had a hard time detecting the aspect of her personality that was meant to evolve. I initially thought being an old woman would help her to embrace life with more enthusiasm, but she seemed to have understood it very quickly and become your typical domineering lady as soon as she enters the castle (with the help of the turnip-face scarecrow). So what was Sophie's lesson to learn? From the ending, we gather that 'Howl's Moving Castle' was meant to end like a love story. I didn't read the original novel from Diana Wynne Jones (in fact, when I heard the name 'Witch of the Waste and saw the scarecrow, I expected a 'Wizard of Oz' like journey) but even in the novel, I guess there was an arc to close, but here, Sophie falls in love with Howl or Hauru, why? She did save him in a way but since she spent most of her time as an old lady trying to break her spell, she acted more as a motherly figure helping an insecure kid, those were interesting twists on the usual characterization, but at the end it seems that there's a return to a basic narrative that didn't match the beginning.I quite enjoyed the film say after the visit to the Queen and then, the overuse of magic and ominous malevolent spirits, then the chants and the chases and I just stared at the screen and thought 'boy, that escalated quickly'. The problem with magic is that it's a double-edged sword, basically when the main protagonist is victim of a curse, her 'love' interest is a wizard, the nemesis turned protagonist is a witch, and the wise queen an even crueler witch, and the castle is a magic spirit moved by a talking fire, well, there are so many possibilities there's no savor to unpredictability anymore, it becomes boring. The movie goes in too many directions and magic shortcuts itself in a chaotic extravaganza. Kiki's incapability to fly the broom was more intense than anything from 'Howl's' climax.Yes, the film is visually pleasant but at some point but so are many Terry Gilliam's movies and they're not in the same league of greatness. At least, 'Castle in the Sky' had the pirates and couldn't be a love story anyway, while 'Howl's Moving Castle' seems to cut-and-paste all the usual elements of Miyazaki and provide a great entertainment without any 'ubstance', the ingredients are all there but making a film is also like making a good cake. Miyazaki did this film like the pastry cook who's just finished his cake, added some Chantilly cream, then some fruits, then some raspberry coulis, and then some walnuts... individually, they all taste great but in the same recipe, they can only contribute to something indigestible.While not a bad movie or a misfire, I think this is just Miyazaki being carried away at the most pivotal moment of the film and realizing at the last minute that it should have a proper ending. Definitely a case where the best was the enemy of the good.",6,1,2,22 December 2017
Walk the Line," The Man in Black who Could Heal the Darkest Souls...
","I was just watching the Bonus Features from the three-disc DVD set of 'Walk the Line' and then I was surprised to learn that both Johnny Cash and June Carter gave their blessing to the casting of Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon. That said many things actually: that the two country legends were positively involved in the making but since both died in 2003, the math also implied that it took quite a long time. In fact, it was a project from director James Mangold that came so early that it was the performance of Phoenix as Commodus in 'Gladiator' that put him on the radar.So I guess it must have been frustrating for Mangold to see in 2004, another musical biography named 'Ray' telling the story of no-less legendary Ray Charles and following the same sequence of events: traumatic and life-affecting death of a sibling during childhood, the rise, the addiction, the second chance, the marital troubles and the overwhelming effect of success. 'Walk the Line' suffers from a déjà vu effect but the blame is less on the film but on destiny that generally blesses the most tormented souls with talent or are they tormented because of their talent?It doesn't actually matter because once again, it's all about the performances, and I'm glad to know that both Cash and Carter left the world with the awareness that their legacy wouldn't be cheated, and Phoenix and Witherspoon achieved the difficult task to transcend the usual musical biopic pattern and make a powerful and harrowing romance. And I'd go as far as saying that Witherspoon takes maybe more than half the credit because she really lit that little sparkle, she's that source of inspiration that works on the movie like it did with Cash. And in the commentary, they say something actually true, whenever she's not in the film, we miss her and once Cash can finally marry her, the film closes because this is exactly the best way to close his journey, he can finally be happy.I was watching yesterday a documentary about Belgian singer Jacques Brel who left the stage at the peak of his career in 1966 because he felt he couldn't pretend to be sincere in his songs, he would only be repeating himself and cheat the audience as his songs only had meaning when they expressed genuine pains. And this echoes a powerful scene in the film where a struggling young father Cash auditioned with Sam Phillips (Dallas Roberts), he starts singing some gospel, and Phillips dismisses it, then he asks him, if you were hit by a truck and only had one sing to perform, one that would say what you are, which one would you pick? Cash gets the message and tries with a song he wrote when he was in the US Air Force in Germany, about some prisoner who killed a man to see him die, and he could sing it as if he was that prisoner. That was Cash' thing, he sung like he meant it.And if there ever is one thing to take from his legacy, is that he might not have been the greatest singer, not the greatest voice or guitar player, but his songs had such a raw authenticity that they find an immediate echo in the audience. The catch of course is that a man capable of singing such songs couldn't be any man, his family life was an obvious decoy and once Cash crosses the path of June, he knows he's just met his muse. This guy who lost as a kid the only person who loved him and saw the good in him finally discover the 'one' that would make him 'walk the line', and you know what, because she's his. 'Walk the Line' is about an artist whose life has been derailed by low self-esteem, the lack of love from his father (Robert Patrick) and rejection from the only thing he know for sure to be destined to him. So, this is a long walk on a line that would finally lead to inner peace but punctuated with so many obstacles, among them an addiction to pills. While this line has inspired some of the greatest songs of rock n' roll and country music, the focus on June Carter prevents the film from being a conventional biopic and works as much as a romance. Reese Witherspoon is actually more of a supporting actress if you judge by her screen time but from the way she totally influences and drives Cash, she's the lead. She gives her greatest performance, one that swept all the major awards and she sure deserved it. This is a woman who starts as a lively funny girl but whose sassy personality hid many demons, such as living under the shadow of her more versatile sister Anita and two divorces that ruined her image among traditional God-fearing American audience. In a way, she also resists Cash because he makes her feel like a part of herself she tries to fight, and it's also a matter of time for her to get clean with her conscience, once Cash gets clean with his addiction and his past. It's all about trying to get clean but having dealt with so many troubles that we can finally spill the guts and speak the languages of those who also got the crap of their world. The masterstroke of Cash' career is to have marked his return by singing live at Folsom prison, as if only he could cheer up even the lowlife, the criminals or the scum. Your audience is Christian, he's warned, they won't like seeing you singing for prisoners. 'Then, they're not Christians'. And maybe there is something almost Christianic in this black-clad figure who could heal the wounds of the lost soul, one who could not just talk the talk, but also walk the walk and the line.",8,0,0,19 February 2017
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," It's because anyone can get offended by 'Borat' that no one should ...
","In the Holy Trinity of comedies with extensive titles, I name the Father: 'Dr. Strangelove or How I Stopped Worrying and Love the Bomb', the Son 'Everything you Wanted to Know About Sex (But Were Afraid to Ask), and finally, 'Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan', adapted from the titular TV character created by Sacha Baron Cohen.Like its glorious predecessors, the title wraps up the general idea of the film. Like Woody Allen's film, 'Borat' is made of little vignettes, outrageously offensive and politically incorrect, like Stanley Kubrick's, it's one of the most brilliant political films. I use the word 'political' because the film delivers, beyond its gags, a brilliant testimony subtly denouncing the level of racism and bigotry that prevailed in the Post-September 11 era, fallaciously disguised as patriotism. If there ever was a film that defined the Bush-era, like 'Strangelove' did for the Cold War, 'Borat' is the most eloquent, endorsed –and it's not surprising- by Michael Moore, himself. But it's not just about America, there is the second titular country too, 'Kazakhstan'. If the merit of 'Borat' is to have put the ex-Soviet Union Nation in the map and print an indelible mark in American Pop-Culture, should Kazakhs be proud of this tall and lanky mascot with a cartoonish mustache carrying a bag with a chicken inside? I guess not, but the alternative is no better. To attack Borat is to take it seriously, now, are we such naive fools to believe that Kazakshtan is such an underdeveloped countries women would win prizes of prostitution. If you're smart enough to get that it's a joke, then you should take it as a joke. After all, Borat turns into derision some aspects of America as well.The film follows Borat's journey to America, with his sidekick Azamat. His mission is to collect all the necessary information that can help to improve the standards of the glorious nation of Kazakhstan. The most appealing aspect in Borat is that he's physically odd enough to appear like a foreigner, even an Arab, and his accents made with Russian barbarism, 'very nice' and 'woowoowewa', complete the hilarious caricature. Yet his gray suit and quite affable nature is enough to inspire the benefit of the doubt and allow him to immerse in society. And in the meantime, we have one of the most memorable cinematic characters to grace the screen with an originality and speech mannerisms that would challenge any struggling imitator. After Forrest Gump, Karl Shilders, Ace Ventura, there is Borat, a new comedy icon.Among the interactions he has with American people, many of them are unscripted; he acts rather naturally, expressing his racist and misogynistic views in the most matter-of-fact way. He describes a feminist as an 'old man', he brings his excrement on a plastic bag in a gentlemen's dinner, he randomly goes kiss people in the subway or during a yard sale, accuses a woman to be a gypsy who just shrunk the owner into a Barbie doll, these are some of the film's funniest moments. But, the fact that he could go as far in his 'act' is really a credit to American's open-mindedness, even though it sometimes confine to their most caricature traits: stupidity. Are they stupid enough to believe the man is only fooling them? Well, the film delivers some answers when Borat lures some Rodeo-participants to ill-speak about Muslims. The film offended Kazakhs, now were American opinions on Muslims that different from the opinions of 'Kazakhs' on Jews, keeping in mind, these were real.The film strikes a very sensitive chord in the way it caricatures the ugliest traits of patriotism and pride of belonging and translate them into laughs. The film tackles the racism of its character by respecting our intelligence and not trying to depict his people as malevolent but victim of their own prejudices. The gags are only the reflects of sadder realities in microcosm, and American audience laugh because it's still better than laughing at themselves.Which leads to one of the biggest issue of the film, Anti-Semitism, Borat informs us that in Kazakhstan, there is a problem' social, economical and Jew', he says it in such a casual way that it's already hilarious, even more than the cringe-inducing national sports made of the worst Anti-Semitism. I regard this aspect as a masterstroke of writing because it consecrates the total idiocy of Borat without condemning it, he's more a victim of himself and we look at it as a jovial imbecile. That he's taken seriously after that is one of the film's most exquisite delights. Indeed, it's not when he asks for a gun to protect him from Jews that is funny, it's that the owner doesn't react to it.The film avoided that Anti-Semitic criticism on the basis that Sacha Baron Cohen was Jewish. Although I understand the point, I don't think it's the right reason to justify it. Would the same film be made by a non-Jewish actor stop being funny? I don't think so, and if it had ever been proved that the actor was malicious, the film would never have been released. Cohen is not mocking people, but the way people are blinded by their own misconceptions. Borat's conception of gypsies, Jews or homosexuals is no worse than Americans' against Muslims. And remember the scene where he realized he played dirty games with a homosexual despite his blatant homophobia, this sums up the whole idea of the film, that sometimes, we're not necessarily better or different in our actions, than the people we accuse. If the Antisemitism of Borat can be taken like humor on the simple basis that Sacha Baron Cohen is Jew, then following the same logic, he should have been American and only an Arab comedian could have done 'The Dictator'. In my opinion, it's precisely because anyone can be offended by 'Borat' that no one should.",9,2,3,3 June 2013
Gremlins," Makes the 80's feel as classic and classy as the 50's...
","It's quite fitting that Joe Dante's 'Gremlins' features many scenes of people watching black-and-white classics on mini-TV sets, one is 'It's a Wonderful Life' (of course, it's Christmas time) and another is 'The Invasion of the Body Snatchers' ('they're here already, you're next!). It's fitting because in a way, 'Gremlins' is like a Christmas movie victim of schizophrenia, trying to swim in waters that couldn't have been more different, a Capra-like Family Christmas film and a Sci-fi/Fantasy monster B-movie, appealing to kids and moms with so many 'ow'-inducing moments and to teens and young adults with gross violence, only redeemed by its wicked sense of humor.But as twisted as it sounds, the film works and now, it exudes the same classic vibes as these very classics I mentioned, now that the 80's are like the 50's in the 80's. And that's 'Gremlins' greatest accomplishment in my opinion, it takes me back to a time that will never be again, and it has nothing to do with chronology, but with a sense of innocent fun that I feel has deserted movies and TV programs as well. It's the kind of film that constantly reminds you of the first time you saw it, and your emotions when you discovered this strange big-eyed creature named Gizmo, perhaps the cutest cinematic creation since R2D2, an improved version of the Ewoks with a Disney-eque touch.I'll never forget that winter morning when I was having my breakfast, my father had just recorded the film the previous night, and before going to school, he was in a hurry to show me the first part, and it started with the gift-moment, which till now, remains one of my favorite Christmas scenes ever. It has everything: a family reunion, the lights being turned off giving it a strangely ominous atmosphere, and the little noise inside the package adding to the suspense, not to mention that haunting whistle tune that will never fail to shed a few tears whenever I hear it. Little Gizmo's entrance is one of the most defining moment of the 80's, and most irresistible too.And Gizmo didn't need any computer support, looking like a cute puppet with lips and eyes movements, so well done that you were convinced you were watching a living creature, so the film doesn't overplay the special effects on that level. The gift scene goes on as the mother (Frances Lee McCain) takes a picture of the creature but the bright light startles Gizmo who immediately seeks refuge into Billy's arms, which is both heartbreaking and heartwarming. The father (Hoyt Axton) just remembers there are three rules to respect regarding the Mogwai, and I still see my father telling me to pay attention, rising his index finger as if I was the one to take care of Gizmo, so I religiously listened to the rules: no bright lights, no water and of course, no food after midnight.I was young enough not to tell the 'absurdity' of the midnight clause, but smart enough to guess that each of these rules would be broken sooner or later and things would go out on control, yet I didn't finish the film until the year after. My father told me the movie was creepy and after another viewing, even as an adult, I can tell that the little one I was would have been scared by the film. It's a pity that a story that has so much charm and delight to offer in the first part, gets so hideously violent after, even in a fun way. Yet there is a scene where a kid played by Corey Feldman is first amazed by Gizmo but then he quickly loses interest and starts reading a comic-book, there had to be some horror and the cute material was only the set-up (although it's what I love the most about 'Gremlins'). All the horrific events are still enjoyable and were cleverly sugarcoated by Chris Columbus' script, but I just love the non-violent parts, starting with this opening scene in the China Antiques store where the father's discovery feels like a moment borrowed from Indiana Jones (not a surprise when you know who produced the film). I love the Capra-esque look of small snow-covered town Kingston Falls and her Mr. Potter-like figure, an old hag who's the only human antagonist. And then you have Zach Galligan as Billy, and that was a perfect casting, there's so much likability conveyed by his wide-eyed naive eyes and his timid smile that his bonding with Gizmo feels genuine and real, and their interactions contribute to the film's best moments.'Gremlins' is full of tenderness and that little piano moment remains my favorite one. There is also a great friendship between Billy and his girlfriend played by Phoebe Cates, and what is more interesting than these two characters (certainly less flashy than the Gremlins) is that they remain as vulnerable and human at the end of the film as when it started. They never turn into some last-minute super heroes, and the last scene takes us back to what makes the film such an endearing classic, it's the perfect emotional reward and it's done in a simple and clever way, letting the final voice-over introducing that 'Gremlins' so Un-Christmas-like score.'Gremlins' owes its existence to the monster-premise, no one would have cared about cute little creatures otherwise, but it's for the cute moments that I'm sure the film is still appreciated and beloved. It also reminds of the 80's where even monsters-films could afford to be cute, and special effects could be amazing without CGI, and when we could come up with new inventive creature and amazement to the eyes without rebooting or remaking old stuff. And to twice the nostalgia effect, the film doesn't just remind me of this time, but of that first time I saw it. And both were good.",8,6,7,7 March 2016
Antz," Too Smart for its Own Good...
","Great films often have one thing in common; the first minutes make you certain that you're going to encounter awesomeness many times. And surprisingly, in the case of 'Antz', I had that impression before the very first minute ended (not counting the opening credits). I should mention that Woody Allen is one of my favorite directors and storytellers, because when the opening shot showed a shadowy silhouette of what looked like a pre-2001 New York City and when I heard the voice of Woody Allen in voice-over, deep inside, I knew it was going to be a very special experience. And I wasn't disappointed.So the shadows unveil tall grass looking down on an anthill where we can hear Z' whining to (guess what) his psychiatrist. His mother abandoned him, he never knew his father and he feels somewhat insignificant. Yes, we've heard that before, but the masterstroke is to have adapted Woody Allen's usual shtick for the ants' world. The anthill is designed to look like a vast and complex metropolis where one can easily develop deep feeling of rejections if he has a mother whose daily occupation consists on laying eggs. When the number of children is to be counted on millions, this is not your usual middle-child syndrome and Z elevates the Allenian existential crisis to its most hilarious heights.And I admire Dreamworks for picking the most unlikely protagonist for not for any animated film, but their first one, their 'Toy Story'. And for its first hit, DreamWorks recreated a very convincing Orwellian society, a world where ants are conditioned from the start, checked at their birth and selected to be either soldiers or workers. Z is a worker, he doesn't like his job much, there's more exciting work than digging holes and demolishing rocks, but as a natural-born pacifist, he doesn't want to be a soldier either. In fact, Z only wishes he could have a choice, to be able to take his own decisions. If children wouldn't necessarily care for Woody Allen, Z's personal issues are handled in a way that can even appeal to a younger audience. If anything, 'Antz' is like a kids' introduction to Woody Allen.But let's not make it too centered on our lovable neurotic loser. As central as Z is, we also get to know his friends, a gentle solidly-built soldier voiced by Sylvester Stallone, a co-worker voiced by Jennifer Lopez, and at the top of the hierarchy, you have Princess Bala, voiced by Sharon Stone, her mother, the Queen, voiced by Anne Bancroft. Bala sounds like the typical Princess with a craving for freedom and self-accomplishment but actually, she's just curious to discover the outside world. She has no projects to cancel her marriage with General Mandible, the ambiguous Army Chief voiced by Gene Hackman, and whose right-hand man has the voice of Christopher Walken. You get it, this is a star-studded cast.But the voices are never distracting because the roles fit the actors' personalities and watching 'Antz', you never feel like watching an 'animated film' but a film driven by fully written characters, not archetypes. And this contributes to very powerful sequences, there's one involving a fierce battle against termites, and this is almost as if 'Saving Private Ryan' was made into animation, and I admire that. I love how DreamWorks went as far as making a soldier (Danny Glover) die in the arms of Z and not make a cliché out of it. I often blamed DreamWorks for relying too much on pop-culture tropes and celebrities but this is one of these times where it drove the plot in a nuanced and efficient way.And the more I let 'Antz' play in my mind, the more I reconsider my opinion about Pixar's 'A Bug's Life', which made it in the box-office top 10 in 1998, unlike 'Antz'. But when I watched the Pixar's film, I knew I liked it but something was missing, too many characters I said in my review, I guess I meant 'not enough characterization', in 'Antz', you have characters with opposite motives and opinions that sometimes overlap, but from these contrasts, believable and gripping conflicts result, not to mention very funny interactions. I can see why DreamWorks producers were so bugged about 'A Bug's Life', this is a case where the lesser film won. Or maybe we should try to see what went wrong with 'Antz'.Maybe it's the look of the 'Antz', too brownish, too geometrical, compared to the cuter rotund faces of Disney, or the fact that you can't really sell a film to the kids if the main voice is Woody Allen, or maybe the parents thought one ant-themed film for the year was enough. Maybe there were improvements to be made in the visuals' department and looking at the following movie 'Shrek', you can tell DreamWorks adopted a more Disney-like style without abandoning their tongue-in-cheek and adult friendly humor. And as a matter of fact, I wonder if the Pixar animators didn't try to pull some 'Antz' humor in their 2001 movie 'Monsters & Inc.' It's funny how the two rival studios can inspire one another.So, if 'A Bug's Life' is a good film, 'Antz' is a great one, so great it made the last Top 10 from the late critic Gene Siskel. It's even greater because you could tell the writers spent a few time studying ants and adapted some scientific facts into the film, the way they form a giant ball, the decapitated hand still capable to talk, the soldiers vs. workers shift. They could also add some human political questionings and philosophical issues like individualism vs. collectivity, and even feature war and romance. The film's as multi-layered as its underground setting.Or maybe that was the problem, it was just too smartly 'underground' for its own good.",9,0,0,3 November 2016
Requiem for a Dream," When Ambition is driven by Addiction ... Prepare Yourself for Alienation ...
","'What's the meaning of life?' I candidly asked a friend. His answer resonated in my mind as the truest words of wisdom: 'To give it a meaning' ... and it's true because it applies to every human being. Call them dreams, plans or ambitions, we all give a personal answer to the eternal 'Why?'. It can be selfish or altruistic, whatever we do should serve a purpose. Even the devoted mother lives for her children, even the bum drinks to escape from his reality and die like the religious fanatic dreams to meet God in the Holy Heaven Dark, mystical or optimistic, we're all driven by dreams. But if I can use a metaphor to define life, I would say that the road is the meaning, the destination is the ambition, we're the car, and the gas is nothing but  addiction, addictions driving our lives in order to fulfill our ambitions, and if there's one film that perfectly illustrated this, it's Darren Aronofky's 'Requiem For a Dream'. This masterpiece relates in spell-binding visuals, the stories of four protagonists that basically went 'out of gas', and exploded the car. It's life in microcosm, in its most pessimistic approach  and the soul of this movie is Sara Goldfarb, portrayed by Ellen Burstyn, in one of the greatest female performances ever. Because living without a meaning is synonym of waiting for death, Sara Goldfarb embodies the tragedy of people with empty lives. Old, lonely, they try to fill their routine with friends, food, anything that could 'give it a meaning'. For Sara, it's TV, especially a creepy reality TV show that gives ordinary people a unique opportunity to be acclaimed and to make a surprise to their beloved ones. For Sara, TV is just a filler, and Harry, his son, played by Jared Leto, is the only precious thing she still has in this world. But when she receives a convincing phone call inviting her to the show, her new objective is to get thin to fit in her beautiful red dress, to be the prettiest, to be a 'winner', like the previous participants.Being thin and pretty, will drive her life until it turns to obsession, the more she'll try to get thin, the more extreme will be the means. Sara's challenge will be to be a 'winner', a dangerous catchphrase indirectly underlining the fallacious hypocrisy, that 'the others' are losers. But a loser, Sara is not because she has a dream. In a heartbreaking speech to her son, she explains that she wants to be loved, to have the chance to be someone, at least for once. Who can blame her? Not Harry anyway, whose addiction to drugs will also lead to the worst. Harry wants to build a future with Marion, his girlfriend, Jennifer Connelly, while Tyron his friend, Marlon Wayans, also needs money to help his mother. These stories all have a common link, a noble ambition driven by a dangerous addiction. We all know they're doomed. The beautiful music of 'Requiem For a Dream' inhabits the tragedy from the start, in fact, the third of the film's emotional impact is incarnated by 'Lux Aeterna' unforgettable violin's theme, one of the most impacting and iconic scores of the last decade.Combined with the music, the editing created the feeling of redundancy all through the film, the repetitions of the same shots with the eyes' dilatation, the opening of the box letter, the colored weight-loss pills etc., highlight that addiction is only a dangerous routine replacing a monotonous one. The editing is so captivating we predict this hellish spiral will go crescendo until reaching a breaking point. Sara always found the box letter empty, she got so used to her pills, she starts taking one, two, three... at a time  Additions supposedly driving the ambitions of meaningless lives create other habits within the addiction. It's as if without them, we condemn ourselves to get sucked into the normality, and prevent ourselves from being what we want to be, which inevitably leads to alienation. Because wanting to be different is also the best way to become our caricature, or worse. In the incredible hallucinatory scene, Sara imagines herself laughing at her own image as if she wanted in fact to be so different she would be among the one who laughs at the kind of people she is. Hubert Selby's book is so ahead of its time it explored the alienation of a society where we want to please people so bad we lose self-respect. That's what happens when you get dependent of your dreams, you kill your inner self to become more socially acceptable  because when you destroy your inner self in order to construct a false image, you ultimately lose everything  whether you want to be famous, thin, sexy, popular, rich, whatever  you fail, you're the ultimate loser.And the four stories are four failures. Sara, let herself down in a pathetic tear-jerking breakdown in the TV studio, Marion started selling her body to get the heroine, while Tyron and Harold tried to find the drugs everywhere until they got finally caught. These four destinies finally converged in one of the most vertiginous climactic montages ever, illustrating how an addiction can make you lose at least four precious things. Sara lost her mind, Harry lost his infected arm in a particularly disturbing shot, Marion lost her dignity, and Tyron his freedom. Reason, body, dignity, freedom, the pillars of lives that addictions, driving ambitions or not, can destroy  and poor Sara paid the biggest price.So, this film put my friend's answer into perspective, if 'life's meaning is to give it a meaning', I guess we should just remember the words of John Lennon : 'Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans.'",10,2,3,20 March 2011
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," As good as a light starter before the Plat de Resistance ...
","A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away  and here we go again, John William's triumphant fanfare celebrates the return to one of the most successful and iconic cinematic sagas : 'Star Wars'. 1999 was one hell of a year for movies, even though 'Phantom Menace' is rarely the first to be mentioned, but the phenomenon of its release was so important it makes you wonder if the film really asks for an objective review.I hate to sound like the movie snob who can't enjoy anything that doesn't have a philosophical message, something to read between the lines, a point, whatever OR that specifically relies on the use of spectacular CGI-driven visual effects; I appreciated 'Star Wars Episode I : The Phantom Menace' (those damn titles!) for what it was : an entertaining Sci-fi action-packed film, and more than that, the commencement of an iconic saga. This is the strength of the film, and the key for an almost certain success regardless of its inner quality, it's the 'Genesis' of 'Star Wars', maybe the one and only cinematic mythology, and if only for that reason, it's impossible not to 'appreciate' it in the humblest meaning of the word.George Lucas created a unique universe and a gallery of unforgettable characters so deeply rooted in our memories, that even the people who don't categorize themselves as fan-boys' know by name and identify visually : Han Solo, C3P0 and R2D2, Luke Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Darth Vader, Master Yoda ... The 'Star Wars' trilogy has the richness and grandeur of a Shakespearian saga, which, despite any flaw you'd find, doesn't deprive its films from a certain magnetism and an undeniable entertainment value. That's a fact, we're never bored by any 'Star Wars' film for something is always strangely captivating, maybe because it's the only series with that particular status, an exclusively cinematic creation from the imaginative mind of George Lucas.You got to credit Lucas for his imagination, this ability to come up with new names, planets, stories is not as easy as it seems, try to do it, and read yourself, I challenge you not to find half of it totally unsharable. George Lucas is like a cinematic Grimm who creates a level of believability even in the strangest characters. Actually, they're never too strange or weird; after all, all the movies of the glorious saga open with a convenient alibi. And in 1999, Lucas had the alibi and the technological power, the film reminds us of how revolutionary the CGI used to appear, before it killed off the charm of handmade special effects and good old miniatures. 'Phantom Menace' might be an exception since the use of CGI contributes to the creation of some beautiful landscapes and spectacular effects, so we can forgive the overuse of what was the biggest trend at that time.But let's get fair in our judgment, if it were only for the strange creatures, the action-packed sequences, and the special effects, the film wouldn't have crowded movie theaters the way it did, it would even have been a pretty dull film. What the first opus of the prequel trilogy cruelly lacks is a scene-stealer, and it's not C3PO and R2D2's minor scenes, and certainly not Jar-Jar Binks that would fill the gap. Or maybe I'm too severe regarding Jar-Jar, he's enjoyable in a sort of cartoonish way and I honestly don't share the harshness of the critics. At least, the trilogy had the decency to start rather than ending with a hard-to-be-taken-seriously character. In other words: Jar-Jar is no worse than the infamous Ewoks (I won't miss any opportunity to express my hate toward these Carebears-Gremlins hybrids) I have nothing against Jar-Jar and again, all these funny-looking creatures are the product of George Lucas's toy-merchandising-drive thinking, but I won't put the blame on him, we all have our little dark side.'Phantom Menace''s enjoyment relies on the rediscovery effect. It's great to see Obi-Wan Kenobi playing the role of the disciple with the master Qui-Gon as the mentor. The casting of Liam Neeson is a stroke of genius as he exudes the sense of quiet force and masterful dignity a Jedi should have. Ewan McGregor is also believable as a younger Obi-Wan, Natalie Portman embodies the role of a queen both powerful and vulnerable, and she's so damn cute. The whole casting is pretty well done. There's the kid, who plays the young Anakyn Skywalker, while it's not a performance à la Jackie Coogan (inside joke), I guess he did the best with what was at hands; and this is not the kind of films that aims acting Oscar nominations anyways. The movie indeed suffers from a stereotypical writing, and it's not a hazard if the most cheerful lines are directly borrowed from the previous films, can you seriously do better, than 'May the force be with you'? Part of the disappointment is that they couldn't.But the parallels between the film and its glorious predecessor is not just in the script department, some scenes echo the original episode, as to highlight that history is constantly repeating itself. 'Phantom Menace' depends a lot on the personal appreciation of the first film, and I doubt it will be enjoyed or regarded on the same level as the 1977 film, but again, this is the film about how it all started. The plot hardly matters, because it's about an evolution, it's about characters starting one way, and this new trilogy will plunge us into a series of events that will end right before the first 'Star Wars', so let's be patient and trust Lucas.And whatever Lucas wanted to achieve, getting back to his roots, pleasing the fans or making money, I believe his desire to start the saga again was genuine and important in his life, life as a series of new beginnings.",7,3,6,9 August 2011
The Sound of Music," Old Hollywood's swan song...
","A few panoramic shots on the Alps mountains (kudos to the helicopter pilot), a sound that feels like nature whispering to us, 'beware, she's coming' and then she comes, breaking the majestic silence with a cheerful and joyful ode to music, turning like a dervish as to exhilarate the happiness inhabiting her heart. Julie Andrews is Maria Von Trapp, and because she's just so adorable and optimistic, I won't say anything about her. Now, to the film.It baffles me that Robert Wise's 'The Sound of Music', of all the musicals, is the one that was for five years, not one of the but THE most successful movie of all-time. 'Singin' in the Rain', Wise's more critically acclaimed 'West Side Story' or the groundbreaking 'Mary Poppins' should have been given this honor, at least. But never mind these considerations; it is certain that the film is a classic and one of the most defining American movies. But one would be aware of it, if every classic or defining movie was enjoyable. 'The Sound of Music' could be enjoyable, if it wasn't too much demanding in terms of patience. Three hours is just too long to take without feeling the need to listen to the sound of your TV, your microwave, your radio car or your bones.Some long musicals are exceptions though, but 'West Side Story' was featuring extremely memorable songs and was about two rival gangs and a love story in the middle, there was conflict, passion, youth and blood. 'The Sound of Music' is about a Nun apprentice who becomes a governess to the seven children of a rich widower, naturally, they don't go along first, but he starts to develop a liking when he sees children singing, then they marry, the Anshluss come and they must fleet Austria to Switzerland, all singing and dancing. It's just like a dramatic take on 'Mary Poppins' with a realistic back-story, but does that make the film entertaining for all that? It could though with more efforts on the characterization (because Plummer is certainly no Dick Van Dyke).There are seven children, but none of them really tries to assert a personality, they actually form a one conglomerate character: the children (except for the older one), but there's no conflict, except for a few pranks that beg you to believe these kids, all as cute as buttons, were insufferable, it might as well try to convince you that Lassie is Cujo. Now, their father is so militarily strict and dour you know it's a matter of time before Julie Andrew' charming smile melts his iceberg façade. But as heart-warming as it is, the film has a unique power to leave me cold, and I guess it must be my fault. I just don't get the appeal, but why someone would decide to endure three hours of non-stop syrupy songs and kids acting like mechanical toys. Andrews is the only lively thing in the film, besides the Hills if that's what she said.I know there's Plummer but he looked like someone trying so hard not to fart during a dinner and it was so distracting that I couldn't take him seriously. He should consider himself lucky to have Maria.. Anyway,, I saw the film, without actually seeing it, for the second time. I felt the need to check a few e-mails, I did it during the songs most of the time, I needed to do something. And yes, people went to see this film in all over the world and enjoyed it, I just saw someone complaining about the hatred on IMDb, stating that we live in a world that has became too cynical. I don't consider myself cynical, good sentiments are one thing, but there's a point where you can't take them without feeling bored. Besides, the film was panned by viewers at its release, many of whom had enjoyed previous musicals, so, I have an alibi.1965 wasn't perhaps the most appealing cinematic year, I can't even think of an acclaimed masterpiece ('Cat Ballou'? 'Ship of Fools'?) so I guess there was room for a film like 'The Sound of Music', the last agonizing sound of old-Hollywood before people would get tired of musicals, before the 'New Hollywood' era. Maybe it's because I'm such a sucker for this period that I can't enjoy all the likes of 'My Fair Lady' or 'Dr. Doolittle', but two years later, another film would begin with a song, not 'The Sound of Music', but the sound of Silence, 'The Graduate' paving the way to an era of creativity and originality.And I'd think silence over any music from 'the sound of music'.",6,1,5,16 June 2016
The Equalizer," The Old Timer Who Masters Time...
","'What I do have are a very particular set of skills, skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you.'The infamous monologue taken from the movie of the same name set a new milestone in action pictures, reinventing the vigilante figure with the additional 'special sets of kills' and replacing the 'crusade against violence' by a less high-scaled and more personal-oriented fight, like saving young and vulnerable girls from the claws of male predators and abusing pimps. It's quite a bold move in an era where 'damsels in distresses' and urban violence have stopped to be popular tropes, but I guess this is why it took the talent of versatile and quality actors such as Liam Neeson or Denzel Washington to elevate the film about the level of pure macho-power exaltation.Audiences would accept these men as role models rather than regular action movies stars maybe because they bring a dimension of humanity and fatherly warmth. Not that it lacked in Arnie, Sly or Bruce Willis but I'm talking about 2010s standards where it's not too cool to sound cool anymore. As Robert McCall, Washington doesn't replay Bryan Mills but gives his own depth in a role that could have been rather two-dimensional, that he made it to finance his 'Fences' or make a departure from his award-baity performances doesn't matter, he's quite the man in a performance that isn't too showy even in the showiest parts. And you've got to credit the patience Antoine Fuqua demonstrates in the exposition.McCall is the bookworm, getting through the Top 100 must-read Books, he works in a home depot shop, gets along with his colleagues, coaches one of them to lose weight to pass a security job test and befriends a young prostitute played by Chloe Grace Moretz. It all builds up to the crucial moment where he makes his 'Mills' offer to Russian hoodlums who showed that women's welfare wasn't their priority. They're all drowning in vodka and cocky arrogance, with every inch of their bodies harboring intimidating skulls and tattoos but naturally, no one takes 'Dedushka' seriously... so the old-timer has no other choice than teaching them a lesson or two about time efficiency. It takes twenty seconds of a nasty fight to make his point but since he aimed for sixteen, we get the idea that he's slipping. Still, it's the establishing moment we've all waited for.The act isn't without consequences and brought the attention to a Russian Mafia 'Don' named Vladimir Pushkin (quite the name) who sends his best dragon 'Teddy' (Marton Csokas) to hunt the killer. This is a standard action picture about a man singlehandedly defeating the almighty Russian mafia and while the film does find ingenuous ways to avoid the obvious comparisons with 'Taken', it's the charismatic presence of Denzel Washington that makes the difference. And it's not a detail, when you have a title that doesn't say much about the film but sound cool enough to make you curious, you've got to have a 'name' to press the play button.It seems crazy said like this but choosing the right movie to pick on Netflix is such a patience-demanding ordeal that all it takes is a title and a charismatic actor. Say what you want about Denzel Washington, his movies aren't all on the same caliber than 'Malcolm X' but he always delivers a memorable performance even in a role that doesn't aim for award and where cinematic excellence consists on dodging caricature and being believable as a skilled fighter. And that's the power a few actors can pretend to have, something that makes Washington equal to Clint Eastwood, his 'presence' is more vital than his 'words'. But even Eastwood couldn't do without worthy antagonist and Washington's presence is enhanced by a solid villain.And maybe that's the aspect that gives the film a slight edge over 'Taken', which is that the villain always possesses a special set of skills and doesn't let himself intimidated as well. And so we follow a cat-and-mouse chase where the roles are alternatingly reversed and where the chasers become the chased ones and we don't know if the film is as good as the hero or the villain So the film follows a long storyline where we see a lot of fighting, some remarkably gruesome that reminded me of 'A History of Violence', but even violence can get routinely and the most memorable parts turn out to be the quieter ones, which all takes us to a dinner conversation and the closest to a great confrontation the film ever got.When McCall confronts 'Teddy' to his own past in Soviet Union, the writing is brilliant, in fact it's so good that the fact that the film chose the safe way and end with a climactic confrontation set in McCall's job area, his own comfort zone, left me disappointed. It seems that Fuqua wasn't so confident about his material that he thought he had to keep on the track and makes the violence an escalating process... but think of a film like 'First Blood', once we know that Rambo is a man not to mess with, the film surprises us with the heartbreaking Vietnam monologue, revealing a hidden depth in Rambo's personality, I wish 'Equalizer' could find a way to take us off-guard.It's a sign of lack of maturity when a film doesn't try to surprise you, even a film like 'Taken' chose to have a shocking moment where Mills' mission proved not to be a complete success, but in 'Equalizer' even when McCall's friends and colleagues are taken as hostages, it's hard to believe that none of them was killed just to make a point. So, either the bad guys underestimate McCall to the end, or act dumber than they should or get too soft it's almost off-character. I guess it makes the fiim as good as the hero... after all.",7,1,2,29 October 2019
Ali," A narrative failure, and of the saddening kind...
","It doesn't take a fan to know that the aura of Muhammad Ali transcended the limits of the ring, the limits of his country the limits of his era.Ali wasn't just a boxer, he was an entertainer, a poet, a man who literally contextualized his time with actions such as joining the Nation of Islam, befriending Malcolm X, refusing to fight in Vietnam because no Vietcong ever threw a N-word at him, he traded his glory for courage, earning even more glory over the long haul. The historical magnitude of a legend like Ali is so powerful that a biopic was indeed overdue, and in 2001, when it was announced that the story of Ali was to be released, that the greatest boxer of all-time would be played by Will Smith, the most flamboyant and charismatic of the then-young actors, and directed by Michael Mann, known for his complex, methodic but ultimately rewarding directing, 'Ali' was expected to be a knockout. Alas, it wasn't.The film disappointed the fans who expected new insights about their hero and the non-fans who thought they would learn one thing or two about the legend: how and why did he convert to Islam? Was his 'arrogance' genuine or was it just an act? How much hardship and humiliations did he undergo as a kid to be so proud and eloquent about his achieved greatness? How did Ali deal with the loss of the title and the years of ban on a personal level? Or simply, how about his private life, what kind of a husband or a father he was? The film provides shades of answers but Ali is still a mystery at the end. We don't know more about him and we might even question the things we took for granted. And the weaknesses aren't just on the content but the form, too. How can a film that deals with a larger-than-life and enthusiastic personality, played by a magnetic actor, and directed by a competent director be so frustratingly flat... and even, dull.I read that it was the Academy Award nomination for 'The Insider' that earned Michael Mann the project. Comparing the editing of 'The Insider' and 'Ali', I still scratch my head, Mann had a simpler story to tell in the sense that the focus was one man, but as if he's used to deal with multi-character driven stories, 'Heat' being another remarkable example, Mann seems only able to indulge to many long silent scenes punctuated by elements of context, generally music, as if he was sure that the audience will always be receptive to the shots of Ali running with a puzzled expression, Ali looking sad and thoughtful. These fillers are so numerous that even the joyful moments, supposed to be the high points of his life, don't elicit the enthusiastic responses they aim for. When Ali defeats Sonny Liston and shouts that he 'shook out the world', I didn't feel the goose bumps from the original footage, I was just glad that needlessly detailed game ended.This feeling is even more frustrating because Will Smith gave the performance of a lifetime, you can tell he pulled a 'Raging Bull' in his characterization and at the end, you could almost feel you had the young Ali on screen, the other actors did good, Jon Voight, unrecognizable behind his Howard Cosell mask would earn an Oscar-nomination along with Smith and Mario Van Peebles as Malcolm X Jamie Foxx as Bundini Brown did justice to the story. But Foxx would later pair up with Mann for the most superior and better-prepared 'Collateral', 'Ali' seemed to have been made in a rush, with a lack of preparation that is baffling from Mann. I liked Ebert's comment that the film features many scenes that looks like ready to get a few cuts in an editing room. I don't know how long did the running across Zaire took place, but did they really expect us to be enjoying it, it was so long that even when the Fight of the Century started, I was exhausted already.Will Smith immersed himself into his character; he gained weight, trained, and was ready to take real hits. I don't think Mann put himself in the same mindset, he should have seen 'Raging Bull' to check how you can make a terrific and exciting boxing game that lasts less than five minutes, he should have watched (or watched again) the remarkable documentaries about Ali, including 'When We Were Kings' to try to extract from them the substantial elements about African-American conscience. He should have watched 'Malcolm X' to see what a good biopic is, that you can make a long film that doesn't feel long, or to realize that the 'Malcolm X' part didn't need to drag on because it would never equal Spike Lee's. The film focuses on 1964-1974, the most defining chapters of Ali's life, but we could have earlier glimpses of his past to understand him instead of a second retread of Malcolm X' final years.Again, Mann is a terrific director but for some reason, he wasn't ready for 'Ali', and my guess is that Spike Lee would have been a more interesting choice, he would probably have focused on the aura and persona of Ali in a more exciting and engaging way. That's what the fans expected, an intimate view on the champ, and this is why the film flopped, I could see the crowds in the theaters when the film was released but it didn't last, bad word of mouth, as simple as that. Foxx would later play in Ray Charles' biopic and if 'Ali' was half the film 'Ray' or 'Malcolm X' or half any other Mann's film, it could have been something. A flop, that's what it is, and of the puzzling kind, at that.",6,2,3,5 June 2017
Catch Me If You Can," A cat-and-mouse chase that doesn't know which direction to take ...
","'Catch Me If You Can' is a fitting title because I really tried to catch the appeal of the film and I almost managed until a final act that confirmed me one thing: a good story doesn't necessarily make a good film, a pity because the movie had great potential but  only as a comedy. This is the film's problem; it's so ashamed of its comedic tones that it uses the moodiest drama as a counterpart. You have two levels in the film, when it's funny, it raises the humor to the level of greatest comedies reminding of good old Billy Wilder or Frank Capra's classics, and I mean that for the two acts, but when it's dramatic, boys it's so depressing I wonder if it's still the same film I'm watching and if it didn't actually convince Scorsese to hire Di Caprio as his new protégé. If only for one thing, I blame the film for having introduced Leo's new serious side.I'm aware that Frank Abagnale Jr.'s back-story carries many serious undertones, but come on; the guy is a con artist, and the premise is so entertaining, why should we care for the whole torment inhabiting his heart? Although I admit I love the whole father-and-son relationship and I thought Christopher Walken delivered a great performance, the story of Frank Abagnale Jr. was begging for more and more comedy. The material was shamefully wasted in Spielberg's attempt to make a serious character study out of this. And if it remained true to the first comedic premise, who else could have done a better job as a 'straight man' than Tom Hanks as Hanratty? He was a constant enjoyment as long as he was fooled by Leo -their first encounter is one of the funniest movie moments of the 2000's- but when the cat-and-mouse situation turned to his advantage, and Frank ultimately decided to help the FBI and become a new Hanratty, I couldn't help but be disappointed. I was waiting for the punch line, but I know, I know  this is a true story.Well, let's admit this is not any con artist, this one was real, but that would have provided twice the excitement, even as a drama. Franks impersonated an airline pilot, doctor, assistant attorney general and history professor, and some of these exploits were made before he was 21. Well, I'm sure if a poll survey was made after the film's viewing, the majority would agree that the 'pilot' part was the most covered, with the most details about his growing craftsmanship as a fraudulent checks' maker. But how did he live as a doctor? How did his life consist on when he was a secret agent? The different chapters of his lives were so unequally covered that all we had to do, is to trust Leo's talent and sex appeal: if he did it once, he can do it anytime. I'm sorry but when you spend so much time on very depressing parts, why do you apply shortcuts on the most exciting ones?And are we supposed to believe that Frank's talent relies more on his sex appeal than a developing expertise? I'm certainly not a feminist, but the way women were depicted in the film was offensive and killed off all the charm of seduction. There is a part where the flight attendant welcomes the pilots with a sort of sexy wink in her eyes: if at that moment, you can't guess that Leo will bang her in the next scene, you haven't seen enough movies in your life. There are absolutely no redeeming female characters in this film, their whole purpose is to serve as a foil for Leo's charm, falling in the most obvious and degrading traps like compliments about their eyes, or a necklace. What was a cute running-gag became a blatant exploitation of women regardless of their differences: from the sensitive nurse to the over- glamorized hooker, not to mention the poor flight attendants applicants, all smiling around unknowing that it's only their sexy butts that are used as a cover.The whole film works as a fantasy anyway and not just for the chicks. It's so stylized that it was impossible to get any hint of realism even in the scenes that rang true, script-wise. The movie had one of the most memorable and stylized opening credits, the whole setting was trying so much to look 60's to the tiniest details, the cars, the clothes, the girls fashions, everything was aesthetically great looking, but at the end it was just like too 'sanitized'. I had the feeling I was watching an idealization of the 60's rather than a true biopic, maybe Spielberg is more at ease with World War II when it comes to the realism of a setting, but 'Catch Me If You Can' was a fantasy on that level. This is why it should have kept the comedic tone, and spends more time on the other chapters of his life, yes, it wouldn't have fitted the title, which was about a cat-and-mouse chase, but let's face it, at the end, after two long hours, it was becoming too redundant. Once he's caught, another time, he escapes etc. etc. and any attempt to focus on the deep relationship between Hanratty and Leo was just bullshit, one was doing her job and the other wouldn't have cared less of becoming his friend, or working with the law. He was in a dead- end and had no choice. So at least the film, could have been an entertaining story of how you can fool the system with a nice creativity, but it chooses to be a biopic with cringe-worthy voyeuristic value. A nice try, an excellent premise, but a movie that doesn't know which direction to take, and this is saying a lot, coming from a Spielberg film.",7,2,4,28 October 2011
Ghost," A Matter of Love and Death ...
","No matter how prepared we get for corniness, we rapidly find ourselves absorbed by the romance between Demi Moore and Patrick Swayze and much more by the depiction of death strangely plausible and, no pun intended, quite haunting.Indeed, the main premise of 'Ghost', which won the Best Original Screenplay Oscar, is to feature death from the dead's perspective. Not a revolutionary plot device but the only one that occupies the whole story with the ghost trying to reach the living. Why wouldn't Sam try to talk to his parents, his friends, why would Molly, all of sudden, become the center of his afterlife? The script tactfully escapes from this criticism when it's clearly established that Sam's death is not accidental, and the cause of his murder incidentally puts Molly in a dangerous situation. I also want to answer one criticism expressed by Roger Ebert, why would a ghost still care about Earthly matters, why wouldn't follow the white light and go have a chat with either 'Elvis of Aristotles'? I think that the most important feeling channeled by Swayze's performance is disbelief. He can't get the idea of not belonging to this world anymore, and this is why I felt that the portrayal of death, as a separation between the soul and the body, and the atrocious witnessing of one's death, was 'plausible', I could imagine myself dying this way. It's even ironic how Sam goes through the stages of grief for his own death, from denial to resignation. And it's extraordinary how Swayze perfectly captures the desperateness of a man who had so much to do, so many dreams and projects and finally saw his life abruptly cut. His penetrating expressions are astonishingly convincing, whether it's for sadness, empathy, compassion, his eyes are more eloquent than any of his lines. And his performance is crucial since he's portraying an isolated character. As soon as he becomes a ghost, he only interacts with a few other ghosts, even Whoopi Goldberg who plays the medium Oda Mae, can only hear him. Swayze's believability relies on his ability to touch the viewers instead of the characters, definitely the most defining performance of an actor who sadly left us too soon.And Sam's exhaustive journey, starts with his necessity to deal with his new condition, in order to stop the scheme that lead to his death. And the learning part renovates all the good old archetypes of the ghost crossing doors and touching objects. Ghosts can feel sensations and only touch or move things if they're able to think themselves as ghosts, it's an exciting part of the film to see a man learning his powers to be able to use them as weapons. In conclusion, Sam stays because he can't believe he dies and he tries to reach Molly because she's in danger. We're far from the whole 'unfinished job' and 'transcending love' clichés, the film delivers something original out of familiar material. The film also innovates with the scary portrayal of the bad guys' deaths. The atrocious sight of moaning evil shadows converging to take someone away justifies the belief in a sort of immanent justice, and the exhilarating idea that we all die twice, the good people going to heaven, and the others in some place, we don't want to know. The villains' demises is very unsettling, it can even traumatize some sensitive minds, and you see in Swayze's eyes that he feels sorry for them, for even death don't make people even. But 'Ghost''s thrilling metaphysical value also originates the magnificent ending which is probably the closest depiction to heaven ever gracing the screen.And there's another cliché that the film tactfully reinvents, the 'Old Magic Negro', and it succeeds for two reasons. First, Oda Mae is a crook, she's not a real medium, which is funny and she discovers that she really has the power, which is even funnier. Secondly, it's Whoopi Goldberg and it's one of her greatest roles, earning her the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, and beyond the comic relief aspect, this is exactly what a supporting performance is supposed to be: secondary, yet so scene-stealing that we can't imagine the film without it. Goldberg provides all the laughs, capable of the most acid irony with Swayze, and being comprehensive and diplomatic, in her streetwise way, with Molly. This is a credit to Jerry Zucker, who didn't forget his comedic roots and made a few hilarious moments of the film. My only regret and this time, I share Ebert's view, I wish he had the guts to portray the second kissing scene with Whoopi Goldberg. No matter how weird it would have looked, it would have touched a very sensitive nerve and be even sadder because we would still get the idea that the sweet and tender Molly can't see Sam since he entered Oda Mae's body and it would have made the final scene even more rewarding. And I can't go on without mentioning the sweet and sensitive performance of Demi Moore as the fragile Molly, unbelievably cute with that short haircut, that became one of the film's trademarks along with Swayze's red shirt and Oda Mae's exaggerated dress. Even though Jerry Zucker, the co-director of so many spoof classics, can seem as unlikely choice to direct a drama like 'Ghost' but with all the material he had, the script, the casting, the visual effects, a magnificent score from Maurice Jarre, all he had to do is to assemble all these elements of greatness in a straight-forward way, without overdoing anything. And the film had the cinematic quality of successful movies; this capability to be memorable in a genuine and creative way, the unavoidable iconic pottery scene with 'Unchained Melody' probably earned the film its ticket for immortality.Not to mention the powerful ending, which, after the death of Patrick Swayze, had the bittersweet feeling of a sad premonition.",8,1,2,13 January 2013
Raiders of the Lost Ark," When Tintin meets Han Solo ...
","'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is like these showers that work on cold or hot water, where both fans and detractors can be right. Ironically, the elements that are lauded by some and that contributed to cement the film's legendary status are used by others to justify their dislike. Still, no one can deny its significance in film-making history.The first opus of Indiana Jones' adventures was the highest-grossing film of 1981 and when adjusted to inflation, still one of the most successful ever. George Lucas was the executive producer, working with his lifelong friend Steven Spielberg, and there's no doubt that Spielberg wanted to direct his 'Star Wars', a family adventure film with the kind of enthralling and innocent escapism that only the magic of cinema can convey. Indeed, 'Raiders' is a kaleidoscope of all the archetypes that built the popularity of the adventure genre whether it's from movies, or comic books. And as a fan of Tintin, there's no doubt that Spielberg made the closest film ever to the Belgian reporter's adventures (although it was more obvious in 'Temple of Doom' with the Chinese boy) and it's funny how most American critics failed to notice that.South America, Africa, Nepal and Egypt, whips, guns and swords, temples and military camps, planes, trucks, horses and submarines, Spielberg gratifies us with so many spectacular sequences, whether it's on the visuals or action departments, that it would be impossible to list them all. Starting with the immortal opening in the tropical forest, where Jones steals the idol, escapes from poisoned sticks, a rolling giant boulder, a bottomless pit, surprising booby traps, we're embarked in a series of thrilling episodes, each one standing alone as a classic, driven by one of John William's most iconic score (which is saying a lot). And to its own credit, the film succeeds in creating cohesion between all these heart-pounding vignettes through an interesting plot. We're in 1936, at the rise of the Nazi party, and as a passionate of the occult, Hitler sent men to find the Ark where Moses received the Ten Commandments. Any army that would possess it would become invincible.Beyond the inspiration for a catchy title, the Ark epitomizes the mysticism that always surrounded the archaeologist's adventures, and allow to pick the Nazis as convenient villains, since their sophisticated manners contrasting with their extreme barbarity, is the perfect counterpart for a character like Indiana Jones, a tough and rough no-nonsense guy, civilized but condemned to visit the wildest places to fulfill his dreams. Jones is the kind of unintentional hero driven by his own passion, he never seems to enjoy the action, but rather its pay-off, and maybe that's what makes him so endearing, he's like a clever mix between Tintin and Han Solo (to stay on the 'Star Wars' connection). And with the archaeologist again the Nazis, science and civilization against barbarity and evilness, in between you have the obligatory helpers, traitors and sidekicks.Counting the clichés is pointless, naturally Arabs are either jovial or cunning, the Frenchman is sneaky and charming, Nazis all deserve to die, Marion, Karen Allen as the heroine, granted, she's a tough woman, we can see coming from a mile that she'd be dressed in a very feminine way, that there's more between her and Jones. The whole film works on archetypes, the power is that it also plays with them. Whether it's Jones being afraid of snakes, it provides an interesting Achilles' heel for the hero, but it inspires the great punch line for the opening sequence when he finds one in the plane. The racism of the scene where he casually shoots the swordsman is only redeemed by its hilarious cleverness. The film has a way not to take itself seriously yet doing it at the same time, and I guess that's why it's either praised or despised. I value Spielberg's intelligence enough to have expected the criticism.Indeed, he would easily be accused of designing a movie precisely to attract people, that all the great things of 'Raiders' were 'marketed'. I'm sure it's right, but what's wrong with that? Maybe it's because Spielberg is one hell of a storyteller. I'm sure he is, although I wouldn't tag the film as a story, but I did follow it with interest. Is the film too naive, too childish? Maybe it was designed by the mind of a director young enough to remember all the representations of his childhood, I'm not surprised that a young Jewish kid would have dreamed of stories where Nazis could be demised the way they are in 'Indiana Jones', before depicting them in a more adult way in 'Schindler's List'. The film relies on a representation of a world, from comic books to B-movies, belonging to childhood, and maybe the film worked because it awakened our inner child.I guess the haters tend to approach the film from their perspective rather than adapting their approach to the film. I can share Pauline Kael's view when she foresees that the deliberate corniness of 'Raiders' would put the deathblow on films like 'Apocalypse Now' or 'Raging Bull'. I agree even more because even though 'Jaws' is the film that paved the way for blockbusters, I've always seen it as an adult masterpiece while 'Raiders' IS a popcorn film, reinventing an aesthetic of old-school fun and entertainment tailor-made for theaters. It's interesting that Ebert closed his review by advising to see the film with someone we like, to grab his or her arm (was he thinking of the terrifying howling mummies?). Indirectly, he pointed out the film's minor weakness, being designed for cinemas, with half the charm lost on TV, videos and now DVD's. Even 'Star Wars' can be enjoyable for the whole Shakespearian and Family saga undertones.Maybe 'Raiders' killed the very kind of movies that could be enjoyed even outside theaters. Still, I can't imagine the world of movies without 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'.",8,1,2,18 January 2013
Spartacus," One man is not followed because he's strong, but he's strong because he's followed ...
","'This campaign is not alone to kill Spartacus. It is to kill the legend of Spartacus.' states Crassus (Laurence Olivier) to his centurions before relieving them. There is a hint of pessimism in the way he delivers this quote, as if he was indeed aware that a figure like Spartacus would leave a great impact in the world even after his death. Crassus' fear was Spartacus' faith, that's the poetic beauty within the antagonism between the patrician tyrant and the leader of the slaves' rebellion.Spartacus, immortalized by Kirk Douglas, has an unforgettable face; it seems like sculpted in a Greek semi-God's mask, so fitting for the Thracian gladiator. And between the man who defies Rome and the man who represents Rome, it's not just a battle of weapons, but of ideals. One worships the ideas of liberty, freedom and brotherhood, one the divine incarnation of Rome. For Crassus, 'Rome in the eternal thought in the mind of God', a powerful quote. How many people fallaciously advocated God or Gods when it came to justify the cruelest actions in order to dominate the world? Crassus' vision was archaic precisely because it was the incarnation of a period where Rome's fate was sealed by paganism and slavery. Spartacus, on the other hand, embodies an ideal that could only be fulfilled two thousand years later. This is why he lost his war in his lifetime, but this is why he's remembered now. The legend is still alive, and much alive. And the greatest thing about Spartacus is how incredibly fresh and modern his story remains.Even now, with all the revolts that plant the seeds of liberty in the third-world streets, Spartacus is still relevant. And the script written by formerly blacklisted writer Dalton Trumbo was even more significant in the years of its release during the escalation of Civil Rights' movements and McCarthyism. The film's most emblematic scene depicts the polar opposite of whatever the blacklisting stood for: naming names and condemning a stranger, a friend, for infamy and disgrace. Slaves stood up and started shouting 'I'm Spartacus!' refusing to collaborate with the enemy, even if that applied their crucifixion. This brotherhood has forged Spartacus' aura in history, and it contributes to a heart-breaking climax when Spartacus and his friend, Antoninus (Tony Curtis) are ordered to fight to the death, and the winner shall be crucified. Ironically, it turns out to be their most ruthless fight because one's death implied the other's suffering. The scene occurs at last when we had more than a glimpse about the solidarity between the gladiators, so, we feel the devastation in Spartacus' heart when he kills his friend.Spartacus was one of Karl Marx' most admired figures because he incarnated the same values to inculcate to the workers from all over the world, the modern slaves of his period. How about now? Has slavery that disappeared, it's not a system of course but it reunites many people victims of a same injustice: people who can only live by providing their working value and thus cannot enjoy the fruits of another's labor, those who incarnate both virtue in the Latin meaning of quality and force, a sort of honorable modesty that deprives them from the decadent enjoyment of wealth. 'Spartacus' is a film that divides the world in two distinct entities: slaves and oppressors, such a simplistic dichotomy can find echoes today, where one percent of the planet still rules the other 99 percent. But much more than a political statement, the film speaks something nobler, deeply rooted in the heart of Spartacus and his slaves, the idea of a community, of a powerful unity. And Douglas' performance is crucial because he manages to betray an ounce of vulnerability all through the film.In one of the most memorable scenes, Spartacus is picked to fight Draba (Woody Strode), the Ethiopian gladiator. Unexpectedly, Spartacus loses the fight and only owes his life to his opponent's suicidal move. Draba throws his stick to the same women who wanted to be entertained and asked for a fight to death just for sheer entertainment. But it's a pivotal moment for Spartacus as he understands he'd rather die fighting this criminal injustice than live in such dehumanizing conditions, like an animal. But as vulnerable as he is, Spartacus drains his strength from community. That's the key, people don't follow him because he's stronger, but he's stronger because people follow him. He's conscious of his legend and accepts the heavy weight on his shoulders. During a poignant conversation with his pregnant wife, former slave Varinia (Jean Simmons), he fears weakness but she finds the right words to reassure him. 'You're strong enough to be weak' While heroism in movies implies a sort of loneliness, Spartacus acts for a collective ideal. His humanistic aura even outshines the film itself and almost makes us forget we're watching a Technicolor big-budgeted swords-and-sandals epic, quite an accomplishment if you realize how much less fight scenes and much more conversations it features. But what conversations! And what a casting! Beyond Douglas and Olivier, there are two remarkable performances that drove my personal enjoyment: Charles Laughton as the plebeian senator, Gracchus, Crassus' greatest rival, and Peter Ustinov as the slave trader and gladiator's impresario Lentulus Batiatus (he rightfully won an Oscar for that role). Both of them, with the same tendency for corpulence and this endearing capability to shamelessly admit their flaws, added a certain dimension of humor and human depth in a rather solemn film. They're essential as counterparts to the grave tyranny of Crassus and Spartacus' flamboyant heroism. Together, they provide half of the enjoyment, something that all the beauty of Jean Simmons couldn't have satisfied.And since the film is still listed in his glorious filmography, kudos to Stanley Kubrick! It's not the most Kubrickian of all his films, but it still stands alone on its own as one of the most thrilling, inspiring and fascinating American classics.",9,1,3,19 July 2012
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," A film with many special effects... and one 'special effect' ...
","The mere mention of a boy befriending an alien evokes immediate imagery. Indeed, we all picture the squashy head of an adorable monster with an extensible neck, huge expressive eyes and unforgettable raspy voice, a pointing finger with an ability to glow at the most cinematically emotional moment, a little boy and a legendary bike ride that flew him to a moon, that had the good idea to be full that very magical night.If Cinema is a world of imagery and magic, well then a certain movie made by a certain Spielberg in a certain cinematic year (that happened to be the one I was born in), deserved its instant place as one of the most glorious exemplification of the reason to be of Cinema as an Art and an escapist medium. I'm being verbose, am I? Well, I'm sorry to maintain the suspense, but this is a trick I learned from Steven Spielberg himself, who, more than anyone, knows how to tickle your curiosity enough to make you want for more, so that the emotional effect is twice more satisfying.And it works, really. The film opens in total darkness; mysterious creatures are wandering near a spaceship. We only see the plants and mushrooms that seem to be the reason of their presence. Suddenly, flashlights and screeching vehicles indicate a hostile presence, the aliens escape leaving one of them alone. Like in 'Jaws', we never see the creature until Spielberg judges it's the right time. Indeed, we have to discover the kid first, so that his discovery of his alien friend will have the right effect. Spielberg loves imagery but he never takes them for granted, it's all about the effects.The boy is Elliott (Henry Thomas), he lives in one of these suburban houses, impersonal but with a charm of their own. He's a middle child, so, a little bit teased by his 16-year old brother Michael (Robert MacNaughton) and a little less mollycoddled than his 5-year old sister, Gertie (Drew Barrymore). He's an outcast in his own family and the separation of his parents didn't help. Spielberg wanted a movie that would evoke the feeling of loneliness in children of dysfunctional families and the late Melissa Mathison's script was the material he needed in order to express the emptiness felt by a boy without a father and without a clear position in the family. And who better than a misfit kid to feel an immediate sympathy toward a naturally misfit creature? That's to say, it had to be young Elliott, to shine a flashlight on E.T. so that both would be scared in a funny and touching symmetry.This 'close encounter' is actually the first hint on what will cement the friendship between the two loners: reciprocity. And like Michael explains to the scientists, Elliott doesn't think E.T.'s thoughts but feels his feelings. This is not about telepathy but empathy, and empathy is a virtue molded by childhood times, because we have less perspective of the world, and are more capable to judge according to our heart than our mind. Beyond the friendship, this is also a film about childhood and it's very revealing that all the props needed to communicate with E.T. and even help him to communicate with his people, all belong to childhood world. Star Wars toys, electronic games, Reese's Pieces, you name them. Of course, out of all the childhood-defining props used in the film, the BMX bike is the most emblematic one and it's no wonder it inspired the most memorable moment of the film.Maybe this is what the film owes its timeless and universal appeal to, being a world of kids, where everything is seen from their perspective, where adults are half-showed like in 'Tom and Jerry' cartoons, where you feel like flying when riding your bike, when you think of freeing the frogs rather than dissecting them. Childhood as a time of innocence and purityit's a bit corny and I remember a comic-book I read when I was a kid, where the hero, after seeing the film, was glad E.T. was discovered by children, a friend of him was skeptical, but to prove him wrong, the hero dressed as an alien and approached a group of kids, they tied him up. On his road to the laboratory, the hero said, 'you were right, that's only Sci-fi'. I also remember when we first saw the film during a school trip, some boys were laughing at the sight of poor E.T. and I thought he was lucky not to have met them.So maybe the film is less about childhood than Spielberg's own vision of childhood? And perhaps this is why the film is accused of being manipulative, like any Spielberg's film after all. Now, is Spielberg manipulative? No more than any author who wants to create the right emotional impact, yes he knows that an E.T dying to make his friend recover is the tear-jerking jackpot, but isn't the scene efficient for all that, and doesn't it make us jump of joy when E.T. suddenly resurrects and happily repeats 'E.T. Phone Home', not to mention John Williams' triumphant score to complete the effect or the so emotional farewell. (Ouch!) Again, it's all about effects and it is easy to accuse Spielberg of manipulation, but the fact is that he took a staple of movies: friendship between different persons and made it an instant icon, something on the same level of imagery as 'The Wizard of Oz'.So whatever was manipulative still made it it the most successful of all time, for 11 years before another Spielberg film would dethrone it. He must have a way with audience, because he considers himself like this audience, if you think the film is overly sentimental from the way it portrays kids, well that's Spielberg's vision, and asnaive as it is, it contributed to a creature without which we simply can't imagine Cinema.",9,0,0,21 May 2016
Casablanca," We'll always have 'Casablanca' ...
","A few movies managed to achieve such a legendary status. Think about it, all you have to do is to hum the first notes of 'As Time Goes By'  ta-da ta-da ta-daaa  and a whole universe resurrects in your memories, forever incarnated by these two profiles staring at each other, Humphrey Bogart in the iconic trench-coat of his career-defining role, and Ingrid Bergman, as gracious as ever.One word : 'Casablanca', and a gallery of characters revives, Sam, the piano player, these unforgettable second-billed actors who graced the silver screen in these black and white days, Conrad Veidt, Sidney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, an international cast and so many immortal scenes, Rick Blaine's bourbon-driven melancholy while remembering the good old days with Ilsa, the patriotic fervor expressed during the singing of La Marseillaise and probably the most emotional farewell scene ever, followed by 'the beginning of a beautiful friendship' as the ending of a beautiful movie. Of course, the list would be incomplete without the mention of Michael Curtiz' masterful direction, the dazzling shadowy cinematography and the Esptein twins' perfect script that lurched the film into Pop-Culture : 'Here's looking at you, kid', 'We'll always have Paris' and so many unforgettable lines that became catchphrases on their own. But still, everything would all have been secondary if it wasn't for THE element that made 'Casablanca' such a legendary film : it's a beautiful romance.60 years later, the movie still divides, should have Ilsa gone with Rick or Laszlo? The consensus is that she did the right choice, but there's no doubt that the truer love was Rick. The film perfectly captured the dilemma of a real triangular love as Ilsa's husband, Viktor Lazslo is fundamentally a good man, a heroic resistant fighter who escaped from a concentration camp, and the only man who inspired Rick Blaine a bit of admiration. As an ex-freedom fighter, Rick sure understands the value of courage and visibly, something from the past has metamorphosed his idealistic nature into the cynical and detached mask of a lone wolf figure. Who else than Humphrey Bogart could have played this role with such intensity? Intense but still profoundly romantic as the wound in Rick's heart opens when Lazslo comes back with Ilsa, Rick's former love, back then in Paris.The international atmosphere of the Rick's Café nightclub gives it a unique and absolutely endearing flavor spiced up that pivotal night, when Ilsa asks Sam to play 'As Time Goes By', we understand that this song has a poignant significance, as the last one she and Rick heard as lovers, before the War came and ruined everything. Ilsa ran out of Rick who, like most of the refugees, escaped from the German invasion leaving Paris to Marseilles, then Marseilles to Oran, and from Oran to Casablanca, in French Morocco, freed from the German control, to get visas to the neutral Portugal, the only way to America. Rick exiled himself in Casablanca, as if something was unconsciously keeping him within the War, and when he delivers the legendary : 'Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine' is he really lamenting? When Ilsa re-enters his life, his office, Rick's bitterness made him say the wrong words, but then he painfully realizes he still loves her, and that Lazlso took her from him.Lazslo and Ilsa need two 'letters of transit' to go to Lisbon, and by an ironic coincidence, Rick got those two tickets from a suave criminal named Ugarte who got them by murdering two German couriers. With the death of Ugarte, the two tickets for freedom were in Rick's hand and a great moral dilemma in his heart : contributing to the War effort and lose the love or his life, or following his motto : 'I stick my neck out for nobody'. Rick's true nature can't fool anyone, but the romance gains in complexity when Ilsa revealing to Rick why she left him, reconciles with him and realizes she loves him more than ever and can't leave him again. The romance is in a dead-end, and compromised by the antagonistic presence of the Major Heinrich Strasser who can't allow Lazzlo to escape. Strasser counts on the collaboration of Vichy's government, incarnated by Captain Renault, another character we still don't know where his heart belongs to, as he said : 'This is my least vulnerable spot' Ultimately, and I guess this is what makes the movie so inspiring, as said Roger Ebert in his brilliant commentary, all the characters aren't bad people. Even the ambiguity of Captain Renault is a nice writing touch that allows to keep uncertain the role he's going to play, although the roulette episode proved his good heart. Even Greenstreet as the head of the criminal underworld and Rick's business rival accepts to buy him out and keep all the employees, even Yvonne, the French girl who dated a Nazi officer couldn't hide her tears when the Marseillaise was sung. Finally, the heroic nature of Rick Blaine prevailed as he decided to take care of everything, fooling Ilsa, Lazzslo, and Renault, but ultimately getting them in the plane. Renault also redeemed himself by the 'Round up the usual suspects' to clear Rick of shooting Major Strasser before he could order to cancel the flight.Rick, #4 hero in the American Film Institute, explains his decision to Ilsa : 'I'm no good at being noble, but it doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world'. He's twice wrong. First, Rick is excellent at being noble. Secondly, now that WW2 is over but not 'Casablanca''s legendary status, whether you love old, classic, black and white films or not, you should ask yourself if the problems of three little problems aren't finally the essence of the most beautiful acts that humanity could inspire.",10,4,5,14 July 2011
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," No CGI except for Charming, Groundbreaking and Imaginative ...
","Robert Zemeckis' 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' is an enchanting masterpiece celebrating the triumph of film-making, with a level of quality in the same vein of groundbreaking cinematic treasures such as 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' or 'Toy Story', combining animation and live action with a perfect and delightful realism.I can't decently talk about the film without paying tribute to the men and women who accomplished this. Consider that each frame implies the use of 24 images per second, and multiply this by the film's length, then think about all the parameters, like the perspectives that influence the size of the animated characters, the light and shadows for the choice of colors, the way the actors must pretend to physically interact with non-existent characters, grabbing them, shaking their heads or having their cheeks pinched by them  and all that stuff without the providential assistance of CGI, totally hand drawn from A to Z, in a total respect toward the same kind of dedication that conducted the hands of the ancient cartoon film-makers, the result is the ultimate proof that perfectionism always pays. There are 'Mary Poppins' and 'Space Jam', but 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' is a class on its own and 'special' is too weak a word to define the effects, they are simply magical.I'm so glad I was a kid when I discovered it, I still remember how mesmerized I was by the introducing cartoon, something that resurrected the spirit of the Looney Tunes, Tom and Jerry, Walt Disney or Tex Avery's cartoons, this universe that vibrates a sensitive chord in everyone's hearts. If you're a kid you love it, if you're an adult, it awakens the inner kid who saw these cartoons on TV, and if you're even older, it will get you back to the good old days when you saw them on the movie theater. Roger Rabbit, even as an original goofy, bubbling, creation, is the living allegory of this Golden Age combining many characteristics from Bugs Bunny, Screwy Squirrel, Tom the car with a certain Disney-like innocence, and after having been burnt, electrocuted, blown, and hit by a fridge, the film introduces, through an unforgettable plot twist, the co-existence between toons and humans in the real world. And the transition to this universe seems so natural that the surprise ceases immediately when we start following the hero of the film, Bob Hoskins as Eddie Valiant.And the choice of Bob Hoskins to play the sourpuss, no-nonsense, private eye, is a stroke of genius, as he perfectly conveys the everyday feel of the noir genre hero with a hard-to-conceal wound in his heart. In that zany and crazy world when you can encounter a clumsy mail-pelican riding a bike, a baby with a 50-year old man lust, giggling weasels or a crazy octopus serving drinks in a bar, Eddie evolves with an unshakable seriousness, highlighting its ordinary aspect, which is a great gag by itself. We would all love to go to Toontown but Eddie doesn't and this reluctance leads to a rewarding sequence when he finally gets into the town for an extraordinary moment, where a serious man suddenly lives under the cartoon's Law of Physicals. If Bob Hoskins played his part in a cartoonish way, this part wouldn't have been as exhilarating. Eddie Valiant is the perfect straight man of the comedic duo formed with Roger Rabbit, two opposite characters who'd go as far as getting handcuffed together.The handcuff even contributes to the most hilarious moment, when Roger easily gets his hand off after the danger is over and justifies that he couldn't have done it earlier unless it was funny. And the timing he chose was perfect! Roger Rabbit's philosophy of life, defines the whole purpose of cartoons, it's all about laughing and smiling. No wonder that the Cartoons' Golden Age coincided with the Great Depression era and World War II, when people needed to laugh, and when laughs were the perfect weapon to handle the harshness of life. And if Roger Rabbit could get a wife like Jessica because he made her laugh, well, it says everything about humor's value. And Jessica Rabbit as the sensual and voluptuous creature, proves that there are no limits for seduction, and I wonder how many men would rather have a creature 'drawn that way' than a real woman in flesh and blood. And if not the best character, she certainly makes the most spectacular entrance when she emerges from that curtain.And the beauty of 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' is that the special effects always serve the purpose of the story. The film didn't forget to have a plot with its share of thrills, laughs, and even some dramatic moments you wouldn't expect. Honourable mention to Christopher Lloyd who proves again his unique talent to portray bizarre characters with an extreme convincingness, his portrayal of the sinister Judge Doom, makes him the perfect villain for such a creative film, hell, can you make a crueler villain than one who found a way to kill toons? and one of the most sadistic acts ever that would make my heart squeak of sadness.And the soul of the story is Eddie Valiant's reconquest of his lost sense of humor, a quest incarnated by one of the most immortal shots of the film, the last kiss between Eddie and Roger. And if I had to find an extra meaning to this kiss, it would be the expression of this profound love we have for these cartoons that enriched our childhood, and stood the test time, never losing their unique charm and universal appeal. And if only for having featured the two icons, Bugs Bunny and Mickey Mouse in the same frame, and the two greatest ducks in an unforgettable piano duet, the movie deserves the title of Best Picture of 1988.That's all, Folks!",10,0,0,3 October 2011
One Hundred and One Dalmatians," TV, car chases, kidnappings... 1961 marks Walt Disney's entrance in Modernity...
","It wasn't called Disney Renaissance for nothing: in 1989, 'The Little Mermaid' was the first animated Disney to feature a princess in thirty years, the last one being 'Sleeping Beauty'. With that in mind, the first Disney animated feature to be released after 'Sleeping Beauty' was a starter in its own right, opening an era of uneven productions that can be assimilated to dark ages. Although perceived as classics they never inspire the same glee in the eye than the likes of 'Snow White' and 'Pinocchio' or 'Mermaid' and 'Lion King'. But 'One Hundred and One Dalmatians' has aged better than most of its contemporary, maybe enough to compete with the legitimate masterpieces. Now, do kids really care about these technicalities? Speaking for myself, this film is one of my earliest memories, and by that I mean very early. I had vague and foggy visions of the encounter between Pongo and Perdita (and their masters Roger and Anita) in the park, I never forgot the face of Cruella De Vil who was the first villain I could put a name on, and as a kid who was a bit cowardly, I used to hide uncer a table during the TV scene. I simply hated that startling moment where the villainous cowboy's face occupied the whole screen and scared the hell out of Patch, and me in the process (quite a 'mise en abime'). I avoided watching, and later renting, the film maybe because of that moment, but the film didn't avoid me for all that.Indeed, one of the first books I started to read at the age of 5 was based on the film and at the same time, I used to watch the Disney Channel program and to those who remember, the intro started with the iconic picture of the polka-dotted canine family staring at the TV. This is just the stuff your nostalgia is made on, you can't control it. And for all these reasons, I simply can't formulate a critic against the film without feeling like I'm betraying my inner child. But I'll let the adult speak a little: after Christmas, I bought my daughter four Disney classics and I couldn't resist the temptation. I had to see the Dalmatians, three decades after the first complete viewing. Enough with the princesses, 'Frozen' and 'let-it-go!' message, how about a family- friendly film about a dog family.After all these dragon fights and dazzling magic tricks from 'Sleeping Beauty', there's a sort of cozy and relaxing little charm 'Dalmatians', conveyed through that opening scene where Pongo tries to find the perfect girl for his master and culminating in the park. The next scene is a revolution; TV in a Disney film. This is an acknowledgment of the role the little screen played on Disney's expansion, and what a wonderfully crafted moment with these puppies staring at their dog hero while we stare at them. TV would even play a part to the story as the two thugs Horace and Jasper will delay their mission because they want to watch 'What's My Crime?' on TV. As a big fan of the 'What's My Line' channel on Youtube, I was surprised to find a parody of the program on a Disney film.But then I remembered that even the great Walt Disney came to the show and promoted the opening of Disney World (or was it Land?). Disney was a pioneer in the sense that he could anticipate the tastes of people but he could also disconcert the expectations and make something like 'One Hundred and One Dalmatians', a family oriented film in the purest sense of the world, perhaps the only Disney with a united family not affected by death, and a great message about it. Even that powerful doggy SOS where, one howl to another, dogs communicate in order to find the puppies find some strong echoes in our era affected by sad kidnapping stories. 'One Hundred and One Dalmatians' marks an unexpected entrance from Walt Disney in modernity.Of course, it had a few undesirable effects such as the constant recycling of images (I spotted that the image of Roger lighting his pipe was reused three or four times) but this is not as blatant as the case of 'Sword in the Stone' or 'The Aristocats' and there's obviously an element in the drawing of these little dogs (and the big ones, too) that is admirable. The sketchy drawing and seemingly static background never bothered me anyway because they fit the very kind of stories Disney would start to tell. And the way Cruella De Vil looks is integral to her appeal, she indeed looks like a devil, a monster, but she might be the most 'human' of all Disney villains, maybe the character modern audience can most relate too, she's crazy, obsessive, narcissistic, but she's a woman who backs up her words with actions, she embodies the darkest side of the 'woman-power' and contributes to one of the most thrilling climactic sequences from Disney. Can you believe that after a dragon fight, the next Disney featured a car chase, and one that holds up pretty well by today's standards.So, it doesn't come as a surprise that she was listed among the Top 50 Greatest Villains from the Top 50 villains of the American Film Insitute's List among the Evil Queen and the Man from 'Bambi', not a bad company. So for the villain, the positive message about family (maybe the only Disney where it's a central theme) and the whole 'great escape' plot, 'One Hundred and One Dalmatians', if not the best, is perhaps one of the most endearing Disney features.(And I just noticed this is the 100th review this film got, next reviewer will be happy)",8,3,3,10 January 2017
Finding Neverland," Never too late to find your 'Neverland' and that goes for kids, too
","Children are so impressionable their general perception of grown-ups is of very serious, capable and knowledgeable persons. Still, kids rarely envy adults to the point of wishing to trade places and stop playing games that exalt and satisfy their imagination. It works differently with adults, they have freedom, power and responsibilities but now and then, they give enough rope to the inner child so they can have a little fun and play.Indeed, before being the movie about James Barrie, author of 'Peter Pan', who inspired the infamous syndrome of the same name, the film is about playing. It opens with a play that flopped with the audience, much to the stoic desperation of the theater's manager, played by Dustin Hoffman. Barrie is wondering how come a popular and fun art such as theater turned into a pompous and boring depository of aristocratic distractions. The manager, who's not your usual bloodsucker executive but a rather understanding person, simply reminds Barrie of the name of their creations: plays. This is a film that often says a lot with a brilliant economy of words.And as an immediate illustration, the next scene shows Barrie playing Indians with the four sons of Mrs. Sylvia Llewellyn Davies, half a Du Maurier and a widow, played with poignant vulnerability by Kate Winslet. She didn't find in Barrie a substitute for her deceased husband but a playmate for her boys. And Barrie's fertile imagination enables him to find each day a new game, a new source of inspiration. So you have a man whose business is to make plays: to pretend, to create new realities, and doing the same thing during his spare-time. You never can tell when Barrie is working or when he's having fun, in fact, he can't tell either. The only certitude is that his last play lost money and he must come up with something really good, time has come to make his masterpiece.We know where this is all leading to and all through that growing relationship between James and Sylvia, and the children, we have glimpses of Peter Pan's world slowly emerging, and the stronger the bonds get, the more it fuels James' imagination. But the play isn't the end in Marc Forster's movie; the focal point is the relationships, between Barrie and the kids and especially Peter, played by Freddie Highmore. After his father's death, Peter has grown up too fast and still blames his mother for having 'sugarcoated' the news. Peter embodies the precocious maturity of children who have to deal with a loved one's death and in his attempt to resurrect his faith in childhood fantasy; Barrie must also help him to deal with the worlds' sad realities, such as his mother's current illness.This challenge is at the core of the creative juice that made Peter Pan such a masterpiece of poetry, that and the instinct of Barrie who rightfully ordered to keep places for orphans at the opening night so that their laughter could convince the adults to watch the play with their childhood eyes. Some adults though seem immune to that capability: two subplots involve the tense relationship with Mrs. Du Maurier, Sylvia's no-nonsense mother (Julie Christie) and Mrs. Barrie (Rhada Mitchell). Both women can't indulge a man playing with children, as a full-time occupation. How can you ever teach them that there's a time to be serious and a time for fun when an adult doesn't set the example?But that might be the essence of the Peter Pan's syndrome: you don't accept a time for being serious. Peter does and this is why at the premiere, he says he's not Peter Pan, Barrie is. In fact, Barrie is as much an adult as all the others and the making of Peter Pan was a project he took very seriously, he was just lucky enough to have a job where fun plays a major part. 'Finding Neverland' might say something about acting in general, an adult way to do kid's stuff or like recent Oscar-winner Viola Davis said, the art that celebrates what life is about. 'Finding Neverland' like Forster's 'Stranger than Fiction', is a self-reflexive gem that celebrates the inner poetry of life.And Johnny Depp's performance is pivotal because he doesn't fall in the trap of caricature; he doesn't pull an 'Ed Wood' or worse, a 'Willy Wonka' in his acting. Had Depp overplayed the eccentricity of Barrie, he would have looked like a big child, a weirdo whose fantasy creation could have as well been the product of some drugs' consumption. But by being an adult who only acts like a clown for 'adult' reasons, his Barrie turns into a fascinating character, both a subject and an object of existential studies. He tries to drain from kids' imagination some universal ideas about the world while translating it into his language and making the story understandable by adults.He becomes his own audience and his own voice, and in the process, Freddie Highmore -whose Peter is far more fascinating than his Charlie Becket- reconciles with his childhood while still understanding the adult world, he found 'Nerverland'. And while 'Finding Neverland' could have ended in that triumphant note, it actually has a deeper respect for life and finds a note that is unexpectedly sad and poignant. Had the adult aligned with the child's mind, we'd have an ordinary coming-of-age conclusion, now, the opposite is more interesting.Indeed, the ending shows the edge adults have on children: adulthood is a mystery for kids, but adults know what childhood is about, it is their role to help them reach that important phase of life, and that's what Barrie is determined to accomplish. Meanwhile he can also ask the grown-ups to slow down the growing process and have fun now and then. Who said Peter Pan's syndrome had to be permanent? Shouldn't we all find our Neverland sometime, somewhere?",8,1,1,10 March 2017
Lifeboat," Victim of its historical context ...
","Although Germany would forever carry the 'moral' responsibility of World War II, a reasonable analysis would show that the peace concluded after World War I planted the seeds of an inevitable conflict, by allowing the rise of totalitarian dictatorships. History is so capricious that sometimes, the truth depends on the chronological limits you apply to your perception and as time goes by, it is written with more objective letters, and facts are gradually put into perspective and not carried away by some patriotic fever. The Holocaust will still be remembered as one of the most atrocious and shameful pages of Humanity's History, but the way the worldwide conflict ended with the dropping of two bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki is still leaving us uncertain about the meaning of what is right or wrong, or when a life starts to have more value than another.That is for me the touchy issue of any war, any conflict, all lives are equal and if there might be such a thing as a good or a right side, there's not such a thing as a life that deserves to die more than another. 'Lifeboat' was not only made before some movies like 'Das Boot' or 'Downfall' would show that Germans suffered from World War II as much as any people, but it was made before the conflict even stopped, a time where propaganda was prevailing and somewhat necessary. 'Lifeboat' was directed by Alfred Hitchcock in 1944, when World War II was reaching its pinnacle, the Axis was suffering its first defeats, but the road was still long for the Allies, the D-Day, the two atomic bombs were not part of history and Hitler was still referred to in the present. The context here is important because it puts us right in the middle of the most important conflict that ever changed the face of the World and provides enough insights to judge the film with objectivity. And two things occurred to me after watching 'Lifeboat' several times: it is a great thriller film, but it's also a blatant case of propaganda, which would have been more acceptable if Hitchcock didn't make it.Hitchcock's film is adapted from a novel by John Steinbeck and it tells the story of several survivors of a ship torpedoed by a German U-Boat, all from different backgrounds. Constance 'Connie' Porter is an international journalist with a strange yet appealing femme-fatale charm played by Tallulah Bankhead, Henry Hull is Rittenhouse, a rich businessman, William Bendix is Gus Smith, a radio operator, there is also a nurse, a steward, 'Sparks', a Biritish sailor played by a young Hume Cronyn and John Kovac, an engineer with communist tendencies played by the namesake Hodiak (an underrated actor who died at the early age of 41). The pivotal moment occurs when they rescue one of the very men who sunk the ship: Walter Sleazak as Willi, the German captain. Interestingly, while most of the survivors are American, two of them have European backgrounds, Kovac's parents are Tchekoslovaquian, and Smith's original name was Schmidt. Gus' resemblance with Willi is a remembrance that the issue was not with Willi being a German, but a Nazi, as if Willi automatically embodied the vileness of the Nazism.'Lifeboat' plays like World War II in microcosm and in a way, all the characters convey the strengths and weaknesses of their side. The Allies are good-hearted, with this Christian generosity than can pass for weakness in the way they treat Willi, and Willi is the most intelligent, practical, capable to amputate a leg, to row, and with great notions of sailing. He represents the 'greatness' of Germania and he's also evil, treacherous and naturally inclined to kill. Of course, I wouldn't have expected Willi to be like the Captain from 'Das Boot' and the film needed a suitable villain, on which I must admit that Sleazak did a great job, because although he was particularly evil, his demise was quite horrific. The problem is that he was meant to prove that the survivors were wrong not to have prejudices against him and should have thrown him in the water the minute he said 'Danke shon' as if any other German would have acted the same. This generalization was still ambiguous and I would have accepted Willi happening to be a vile Nazi if the film wasn't 'ruined' by the ending where another Nazi soldier showed that he was no better than Willi, proving in substance than any German is an evil Nazi.I still give the movie an 8, because it started as a gripping thriller and ended in a brilliant piece of propaganda and for the sake of objectivity, I can't judge this with today's eyes. Still, I wish Hitchcock could have avoided the patronizing statements of the last minute of the film. 'Lifeboat' could have been a real masterpiece, but a masterpiece it is not.By the way, how do you determine what is or what is not a masterpiece? Well, I remember an interesting statement made by Orson Welles on the 'Dick Cavett Show'. He said that basically you could make a masterpiece in anything: even in pornography, if you intended to excite people and stimulate them sexually. However, you could never make a masterpiece that happens to be a pornographic film, because a masterpiece is something that elevates human spirit and challenge the emotions to a unique and unknown dimension, libido is too low and too easily aroused to be considered. And on that aspect, I would also add propaganda, which is aimed to convey an instinct of superiority; you can make a masterpiece of propaganda, but not a masterpiece that happens to be a 'propaganda' film.I don't know what was Hitchcock's intent with 'Lifeboat', but I guess that by trying to make both, neither of them worked.",8,2,3,5 April 2012
Training Day," Fantastic premise, but too much 'bad-Denzel' for the film's own good ...
","Boy, was Denzel Washington good at being bad ! You almost have the feeling that he had fun portraying Detective Alonzo Harris, the corrupt cop and mentor, during the titular 'Training Day' of Jake Hoyt, the rookie played no less convincingly by Ethan Hawke. Both actors would be nominated for the Oscar, but only Washington took it home. This is how persuasively villainous he was. The recognition also came from the American Film Institute that put him #50 of the Top American villains, the last spot but to his defense, he was the most recent entry. Anyway, « Training Day » has been remembered ever since as the « Bad Guy Denzel Movie ».Washington had fun and it sure shows, he gives a figure that is not that unfamiliar for cop-movies buffs a larger-than-life vibe, he's on the screen for less than twenty seconds that you know you're onto a great creation, a narc cop dressed like a Black Panther or Black Muslim militant, a gangsta goatee and a black beanie, a smile that would make any small-time thug freeze from fear. How come an actor with such a friendly face can get so intimidating, sure part of the merit comes from Washington's performance, but it also owes to Ethan Hawke who, as Jake Hoyt, is the perfect counterpart to Washington's alpha male confidence. And their first exchanges in the restaurant shows with a few words that these men are separated by experience, equaling in such a dirty racket, to an eternity.Hoyt lives in a modest apartment with his wife and a 9-month daughter, his dream is to climb the social ladder, which in the Police, means he must pass the 'danger' square. The training day is Hoyt's opportunity to make his bones, his career depends on it. That perfectly sets up his character, he's a man determined to succeed and be a good police officer. Part of his learning will consist on discovering that both goals can cancel out one another, yet the film would've been too cynical had it been the culmination of the 'coming-of-age' learning. It's not a movie about the disciple outranking the mentor, but the disciple learning a few ropes from the mentor and still be able to stick to his values. And that's what, in my humble opinion, emerges from the first exchanges, Harris is a static character, Hoyt evolves, and part of the interest relies on Jake's evolution. And that works most of the time.The problem with « Training Day » is that it gets so wrapped up on that premise of Washington being the villain that it is almost used like a gimmick, and Hoyt's evolution is only limited by the scope of that training day, we never get to know what changed exactly in his view and how that will affect his future. The film takes a conventional turn to a personal face-off between the good and the bad guy, which in the final act, is a bit of a let down compared to the whole 'close to reality' card it played right at the beginning. 'Training Day' tries to be many things at the same time, for its own good. Let's get it straight, it never ceases to be entertaining, and this is a good movie, but it could have been so much grander had it chosen not to focus much on Alonzo Harris. In my opinion, he should've been the supporting role, which, technically, he was, as he literally 'supported' the most interesting character's arc.God, that whole first hour of « Training Day » is a terrific slice of post-September-11 era, these times I couldn't imagine I'd be nostalgic of. Even the casting of Snoop Dogg as one of the informers gives the film a little edge by encapsulating the post-Millennium day where urban violence, rap and money contributed heavily to Pop Culture imagery, where the sight of death wasn't a taboo anymore. In a way, Alonzo Harris is an efficient villain because he's emblematic of his time, being a Cop with a 'C' like in cynical, corrupt and charismatic. Yet, it's with Hoyt that I related, as a Millennium kid who wanted to believe there's a part of goodness to take from society, wishing he wouldn't fall in that trap Harris kept luring him into. I also identified with the relationship between the rookie and his new boss, something I've had enough experience to appreciate the realistic way it was conveyed in the film.You know these first days at work, where you're being taken by your coach or top manager everywhere and you feel so useless between all these people who know each other. Indeed, that's why the first day is always the worst : each impression you give is the first, and in Hoyt's business, a bad impression is something he can't afford. You're also the most recent newcomer, the one who knows the least people, this is how marginal you are. The wisest thing is to shut up, to listen, to learn. Hoyt has no other choices than listening to Harris, and Harris is no stupid, he takes advantage from it and cunningly toys with Hoyt's eagerness to prove his value, and isn't that the biggest trap you can fall in. And as the day progresses, you can feel the distance widening between Hoyt and Harris, and I hoped the movie could focus on Hoyt because Harris didn't need more screen time to make an impact, it worked from the start.'Training Day' tried so many things it got convoluted in complicated plot devices and other contrivances, some of them unfortunately, were too blatant to be even taken seriously. While it started as one hell of a character study mixed with police procedural à la 'French Connection', it ended like 'Scarface'. I don't mind a good over-the-top performance but the film could've been remembered for more than being that movie with a bad guy Denzel.",7,0,3,24 July 2015
In Bruges," 'In Bruges', get in the mood of one of the most unforgettable cinematic trips ...
","What a fantastic 'little' movie and I mean no disrespect by using the epithetic 'little'. In fact, it's a word that conveys extremely well the charm of this film, set in a small town in Belgium, Bruges, one of the unlikeliest but cleverest settings of a crime film. Even the title couldn't have been more eloquent, since the whole point of the film is that two Irish hit men are basically spending time 'In Bruges', waiting for their boss' instructions after a botched job. While one of the two protagonists, Brendan Gleeson as the calm and moderate Ken, takes the opportunity to do the most normal thing we would do in a touristic place, his younger partner and friend, Ray, Colin Farrell, more free-spirited and tormented, impatiently thinks of leaving the town.There's a melancholic feeling inhabiting the first part of the film, as if we're waiting for something to happen 'In Bruges', the action takes its time ... but that didn't bother me at all. The pacing's slowness gives us enough time to follow the characters and understand their personalities, and in the specific case of Ray: the big trauma that tortures his mind, and might have something to do with their 'waiting' in Bruges. And as the film progresses, you realize that Ray's pain reveals another one, even subtler, hidden in Ken's heart. It's a film with an unexpected depth that doesn't distract from the whole comedic atmosphere and reveals what is for me, one of the best written scripts of the last decade. Actually, I still wonder if I saw a black humor comedy or a light-hearted drama, but in both cases, I know I've seen one of the most unconventionally original films which is hard not to review without sounding like a pompous critic.So ... what I loved the most about 'In Bruges' is this little universe it created, something very distinctive that I can't compare with any other film. A unique atmosphere where tourists, actors, thieves, prostitutes meet together and discuss everyday or futile matters like we do in real-life, when we go visit a foreign place. It's a cinematic melting-pot made of curiosity, discovery and knowledge, creating a supplementary delight while watching the film, as if the town was a character we learn about it, too. And that's how the movie works first, as a comedic medley of all the intriguing and entertaining situations we face while visiting a foreign country, something that gives the impression of an episodic and non-linear story, but the power of the script is that all these situations evolve crescendo and then finally combine for a totally satisfying and gripping climax, even more gripping because it took time to come to this situation. Where the official antagonist appears, Ralph Fiennes as Harry, the boss with some serious anger management's problem, we know we are getting closer to a memorable shootout, and a movie as original as 'In Bruges' couldn't have disappointed.But I don't want to spoil anything from that movie, just to say that the performances from Gleeson, Farrell and Fiennes, are absolutely amazing, and convincing in their mix of goofy seriousness and melancholic depth. In many moments all through the film, especially in the scenes featuring Ken and Ray, you never cease to feel extreme empathy for these people whose presence in Bruges seems to serve a purpose that goes beyond the mission, as if it meant something even deeper, strangely deeper, they can't even figure what  as if Bruges was in the crossroads of these fates where something new was going to explode from these cocktails of feelings, of traumas and repressions, like those kind of holidays where we do change, from redemption or alienation, or both  but this is not a movie to over-analyze. The intellectual approach is smoothly invited near the ending when we collect the right pieces of the puzzle, and wait for us to find the last, the most precious piece, which still relies on the central character's soul, Ray.Ray is not necessarily deeper than Ken, and at many points, Ken is the most likely to get our sympathy, but what makes Ray more interesting is the way he's highlighted and foiled by the people he meets. Ray makes us encounter strange and unforgettable characters in a way that seems to go nowhere, like the very trip in a random place named Bruges, and the greatness of that film, is to make you wait until the end before you realize, they couldn't have chosen a better place to live this adventure. In Bruges, as the quintessential charm of the apparent insignificance which offers the best setting to explore our lives' own insignificance until the ultimate realization, that some things must change. Damn, whenever I try to praise the comedy, I end up talking about a drama.Indeed, 'In Bruges' seems to be more a lighthearted drama that transcends the dramatic element and translate it into something so deeply funny, that you're never quite sure if you should laugh or cry, but why hesitating, the barrier between the two is so tight, you can go back and forth from one emotion to another without feeling any emotional jet-lag. And like the story, the emotions provided gets more and more intriguing and disturbing until they culminate in a tower where comedy thrones hand in hand with the psychological thriller in a bloody honeymoon, in a small town, named Bruges  Bruges finally put in the Belgian map, in Belgium, the country that 'Man Bites Dog', another masterpiece of Black Comedy, put in the map too  Bruges as the crossroads of destinies, or dead-end, or both  Bruges as the town, we hate so much, we just can't live in, but can't leave it either",10,2,5,21 April 2011
Kung Fu Panda," White (and Black) Bears Can't Fight...
","Where does the fascination for Kung-Fu movies come from? My guess is that it relies on three simple levels: first, it's aesthetically appealing and visually gracious for what is still a fighting sport, unlike boxing or say, other martial arts, like Judo, any duel feels like choreography. Secondly, it is over the top in a very spectacular way, and thus explain its exploitation for video games, when the human body became as dangerous and efficient as some robotic armor. Besides, there's something fun in watching Kung-Fu movies, it is comical precisely because of the exaggerated moves and an actor like Jackie Chan based a successful career on turning it into comedy, without mocking the essence of Kung-Fu of course, but rather its applications.Last but not least, there's an inner element of underdog stories in all martial arts, but especially Kung-Fu because it's one of these disciplines where you have the feeling that you can defeat the odds more than in any sports, as most of the learning is in the brains before the brawn, and the cliché of the pint-sized Master, being the sum of all his wisdom and capable to triumph over an army of towering thugs, is inspirational to all the little guys who wished they could master Kung-Fu when it could help them. So, for all its underdog, comedy and spectacular premises, Kung-Fu was a darling for Japanese anime, and I, myself, grew up with a great cartoon called 'School of Kung- Fu', but these were hand-drawn classic animation that didn't explore the true potentiality of CGI animation, like for video-games. Finally 'Kung Fu Panda', DreamWorks' animated movie, released in 2008, knew how to handle the sports sub-genre with the perfect mix of special effects and comedy, telling the story of Po, a panda who's designated by an old master (or fool, or both) as the new Dragon Warrior, much to everyone's surprise, including Po. Po is a panda, so obviously, he's a fat, a bit lazy, a bit easygoing, so inevitably hilarious character, and he's voiced by Jack Black, who strikes again after his Lenny in 'A Shark Tale'. But 'Kung Fu Panda' is much more fun and engaging, there's no pop-culture reference, only Kung-Fu archetypes. We're all used to: initiations, wise masters delivering wise lines with such a quick wit we all feel dumb in comparison, long stairs to mount, super-choreographed fights, but these elements never feel recycled because the story finds a way to be original within the predictability of its plot.Calling it predictable is a bit unfair actually, because there are many original things that strike: Po is a Panda living in a restaurant, his father for some reason, is a duck (James Hong) and there's absolutely no explanation, but his restaurant waiter Job, would serve the story (so to speak) in the most interesting way. Secondly, the panda has no personal pretension to seek any title, he's a fan of martial arts, but would rather watch the show (after triumphing over the stairs) than play the game. But the old turtle Oogway (Randall Duk Kim), tells Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) that he had a vision of the Dragon Warrior, Shifu displays the talents of his Furious Five, a tigress, a mantis, a crane, a monkey and a snake, but despite their talent, Oogway picks Po who accidentally disrupted the show. As he says, there are no accidents.There are no accidents indeed as another vision of the turtle is proved true as he foresaw: the redoubtable Tai Lung escaped from prison to seek a revenge. I wouldn't dare to spoil the backstory of Tai Lung, but along with Shifu, Po and Oogway, he creates a quarter of great characters. Tigress, played by Angelina Jolie, is a close runner-up but I don't know what the fuss is about with the all-star cast of the Furious Five, they always operate as a whole and are not given much dimensionality or depth as the others. If only for the interaction between Shi-fu and Po, the film was worth to watch, despite Seth Rogen or Lucy Liu's efforts. Tigress isn't really exploited to her fullest, and the training part is rather brief, so I think there was a wasted potential, although the final result is still entertaining.So we get a story where the hero doesn't consider himself a hero, nor does his master, but somewhat they're forced to believe in it, until the prophecy fulfills, it's one of these tales that encourage you to believe in your potential and the result would have been dull if it didn't use a clever use of Po's gluttony, and the wisdom of his father. The fight scenes are entertaining and spectacular, as the film had brilliantly explored the potentialities of CGI to make entertaining and spectacular stuff. In fact, it is a little overplayed as it gets closer to the appeal of video games, to the point you never get the feeling the characters can ever die, they defy gravity, they survive explosions or high falls so we're closer to Street Fighter than the real Kung Fu. But let's not make it a reason to dismiss the spectacle the film has to offer.",8,0,0,8 June 2016
Chinatown," Patience and attention demanding ... getting better after each viewing ...
","First time I saw 'Chinatown', it looked good and I liked it, the second time, it was even better, and so on and so forth, but there was always a little something that couldn't get me totally 'into the film'. Yesterday, I decided not to 'watch' 'Chinatown' but to 'pay attention to it', and I finally got why it is regarded as one of the greatest American films.As soon as Jerry Goldsmith's haunting score starts, a genre is resurrecting, a private-eye whose cigarette smoke harmoniously draws the hair of a femme-fatale, and a title announcing a haunting presence. Roman Polanski adapted the film-noir genre with a more modern touch : the first frames featuring pictures of very explicit sexual poses show how far we are from the Hayes Code, and the photographer is not the archetypal private eye, laconic, full of debts and booze. Jack Nicholson plays the role of J.J. aka Jake Gittes, a man who made 'private eye' his métier, perfectly organized, with two associates and a secretary, ironically earning his respectable money from the depraved lifestyle of the pre-war Los Angeles.Strangely, the first client almost disappoints as she's too unbelievably stereotypical. She's apparently a rich woman pretending to be Mrs. Evelyn Mullray, with an exaggerated aristocratic look. She suspects her husband, the Chief Engineer of Water and Power, of cheating her. We're finally reassured when the real Evelyn makes her appearance, but pay attention to the details: she had to trick J.J. and makes him admit that he's never seen her, what could have been compromised if the two associates had warned him when he came. The script needed Jakes to enter with such enthusiasm he wouldn't let anyone talk, hence the hilarious Chinaman joke, and its embarrassing aftermath.Every detail, every originality, plays a significant role. Jakes takes one card from Mr. Yellburton of the Water and Power office and uses it later, to enter a protected zone. Even the details that are not plot significant, like when Gittes deliberately annoys Yellburton's secretary or asks a snotty office worker for a ruler, so he can tear a piece of paper and cover it with a loud cough, give an extraordinary sense of reality. The film doesn't even deal with an exotic statuette or a jewel heist, but the control of water, an unlikely subject that brilliantly comforted the 'mystery' element of the film as when a Chinese man tells Gittes that the water is 'bad for glass', and it takes a second meaning when you hear it again. Everything looks natural and unforced, but the perfectionism demands a concentration from the viewer, for a rewarding pay-off.The script is renowned for having been written by Robert Towne with Jack Nicholson in mind. Indeed, who else could have embodied such a cynical and apathetic attitude with this appeal, the way Gittes evokes his professionalism makes him even more charismatic as it justifies his insistence to solve the mystery, as stated in Polanski's favorite moment, when Jake and Evelyn appears in profile, face to face, with the famous bandage on Nicholson's nose and the priceless line 'I like my nose. I like breathing through it'. Faye Dunaway is also perfect as the black widow whose sophisticated mannerisms, finely traced eyebrows and bright red lips, give her a misleading femme-fatale appearance, that couldn't let you guess that she's actually the heroine as the character with the most selfless motives. The whole film is full of illusions and contradictions illustrated by the perfect casting of John Huston as Noah Cross, the powerful mastermind, whose evil scheme is hidden behind his elegant courtesy and the funny way he always call Jakes 'Mr. Gitts'. A perfect casting that also includes Polanski as the 'Kitty Cat' midget.But behind Polanski's inside joke cameo, Gittes keeping this big bandage in his nose is the unforgettable trademark of the film, an ironic punishment and the warning to a man whose nosiness might cause bigger damages. And that's the power of 'Chinatown', the constant feeling of an imminent danger, embodied by this word : 'Chinatown'. Towne, the Oscar winning writer of the script, asked a policeman what he did in Chinatown, he replied : 'As little as possible'. If you wonder what kind of law enforcement that is, just listen to Gittes explaining that sometimes during Chinese gang quarrels, with so many different dialects, you never knew when you prevented a crime from happening, or when you were causing one, so the best thing was to do 'as little as possible' and visibly, there is a wound in Gittes' past, as he tried to help a girl, who was finally 'hurt', an obvious euphemism.'Chinatown' resonates as a resurgence of Gittes' past, with another woman he wants to protect, and the tragic irony is that we get the meaning when it's too late. And this is where I'm glad the movie was made during the 70's when directors were allowed to shock you with a dark ending. Polanski rightfully insisted that the movie needed to end tragically to be memorable and meaningful, he who lost Sharon Tate, in a savage massacre in that very town of Los Angeles. And the fact that Cross doesn't get his comeuppance makes him even more a creepier villain. The tragic ending was foreshadowed by many details that look even more symbolic after several viewings, Evelyn's strange spot in her eye, the moment where her falls on the horn, so we're prepared when he hear the sound again. It's those little details that make the difference.The movie ends brutally, but thanks to the perfection of Towne's script, Polanki's masterful direction and final personal touch, and a top-notch acting based on Nicholson-Dunaway-Huston triangular force, we understand the significance of 'Chinatown', and sure after such an event, Gittes' would probably become more cynical and more apathetic, but will he really forget another Chinatown? We sure won't ...",10,1,2,13 July 2011
A Star Is Born," 'Bad Romance' made Lady Gaga a Pop Star, a Good Romance will make her a Hollywood Lady...
","'A Star is Born' is a cinematic contradiction. It reveals a lot and yet doesn't reveal much.There's a moment that caught my attention and doesn't feature any of the two lead actors. Ally's father (Andrew Dice Clay) tells his colleagues about people who had enough talent to compete with the likes of Sinatra (with Sinatra actually) but didn't have their big break or didn't believe in themselves enough. Point was: it's not enough to have what it gets, it also takes to believe in getting it.Now, let's get back to my contradiction: Lady Gaga is an international star, as soon as she popped up in the pop scene, it was quite obvious she was the true heiress of Madonna and a star in her own right. It wasn't just about her talent but also her eccentric looks, her unique sense of fashion, and the fact that an ordinary-looking Italian girl-next-door could become a legitimate icon. So everyone thought she was the new Madonna but who would have thought one second she would also be the new Barbra Streisand?What Lady Gaga delivers in 'A Star is Born' is a performance that shines through its straight naturalness wrapped up in an artistic talent that blooms under the comforting direction of Bradley Cooper, the director and his character. That an established star would be able to get back to her roots and play a shy newcomer (with an uncanny resemblance to Sofia Coppola) slowly overcoming her insecurities is actually more impressive than any of your routine Oscar-bait mellow-dramas.So Lady Gaga is Ally, a girl who's got the talent but has entrapped her motivation behind the bars of a nose complex (can't help but see the Streisand parallel). It takes the encounter with Jackson Maine -an aging rocker played by a handsomely bearded Bradley Cooper- to realize that she's got it after all. It's not just the talent but that she's got something to tell. It might sound corny but the film is actually immune against such criticism because one can't ignore the self-referential aspect.Now let me open a parenthesis: I was looking forward to watching 'A Star is Born' before that version was even in the talks, I wanted to watch the Judy Garland then the original and the 1976 remake. It ended up with Cooper's being the first version I saw. It's obvious that the titular star can't not-be played by a complete artist with a few personal demons to slay and Streisand and Garland must have a great deal of adversity in their lives. It is obvious why some confessions from Ally hit the right chord acting-wise.Indeed, being Ally allows Lady Gaga to open up about her insecurities in the kind of bravura performance that goes deeper than making yourself uglier, it's about undressing your soul. Ally represents Stefani Germanotta before all the 'Roma-Romama' and 'Ga-Ga Ou-lala' started spreading all over the radios. I discovered her at the end of 2009 and at the beginning of 2010, Lady Gaga was a brand-name already. So yes, a star can be born that quickly because there's something about talent.Hips don't lie, said Shakira, I would say talent is an even worse liar, which takes me back to the initial contradiction. The show reveals that Lady Gaga is not only musically gifted but can play her heart out and is worthy of more demanding roles than Madonna or BeyoncÃ©... but I wasn't surprised, it wasn't just her Golden Globe win that rang a bell but the fact that some people just got what it takes. And for that, even Bradley Cooper deserves some credit, that he recycles material and works on a timeless story doesn't mean he couldn't fail, he jeopardized his credibility on this directorial debut but proved to do half the job well by having the right cast.Lady Gaga was perfect for the role and so was he as the lead role, the fading star Jackson Maine who discovers accidentally Ally singing Piaf in a shacked up bar and decides to take her as a protÃ©gÃ©e. It doesn't fool us one second that what go between these two persons are vibrations that venture in the realm of love rather than any dream of musical achievement, but it's through music that they find a way to seal their romance, through the future Oscar winner 'Shallow', a song that I would have kept humming outside the theater if it wasn't for 'Bad Romance' interfering with it.The beauty of 'A Star is Born' is that it works as much as a romance than a music film and combines these two aspects expertly. It's the kind of love story that doesn't need any artificial plot device, no cheating, no prison, only the ascension of a young woman and the descent into the hells of alcoholism of a man. The film opens with their romance and the rest is all about how one slowly rises above her demons while the other sinks into. It's a love story and the process of a separation going through scenes that are rather painful to watch and one so embarrassing I couldn't stare at the screen.To think that I suspected Bradley Cooper would give himself a very grateful role but he's got perhaps an even more challenging one as he goes against his charming persona and is surprisingly good at conveying pathos without never being totally pathetic. For a directorial debut, the result is quite impressive and I envision at least four Oscar-nominations with a few technical nods such as Sound and Editing. I'm not sure Sam Elliott would get a nod but he was also a highlight in a film that full of them.And beyond these Oscar considerations, even without watching the predecessors, 'A Star is Born' does justice to the story, if not a masterpiece of originality, the performances are sincere and draw you into caring for every character and the songs memorable. What more could you ask for?",9,4,7,17 November 2018
Gravity," Houston, I have a problem...
","Before 'Gravity' occupies the black screen with the same ominous effect than TV series' title 'Lost', you have this superposed text about the temperature and pressure in space making life impossible. When I saw this, my immediate reaction was 'duh? really?', how about telling me something I don't know.I don't mean to be sarcastic but it doesn't take a scientific degree to be aware that life in space is impossible, that space couldn't carry sound and air. So, I was questioning the inclusion of this disclaimer. Surely, Cuaron trusts enough the intensity of his material not to need to amplify the menace that will pend over the heroine, so why the thought-challenging director of 'Children of Men' would state the obvious? Because he treats a very basic premise in the most basic way, taking for granted that just because it is a story of survival, we will relate to it. It just works on a primal level and Sandra Bullock manages to elevate the material to the required emotional level. I was touched by her struggles to get to Earth, but the film didn't make me care for how good she was, it wasn't a 'stranded' performance in the same level than Tom Hanks in 'Cast Away', but it's not Bullock's to blame, but the wrong approach.Indeed, we understand it's a race around the clock, so how about keeping this in subtext and try to enrich the film a little bit? We have woman stranded alone in the most hostile place and deprived of the most basic aspect of humanity, which is standing and walking, yet still using the one human strength still able to work: intelligence, that was the heart of the film and it worked for the most part. But let's not pretend that the triumph of 'intelligence' is enough to make a whole film, especially after 'Apollo 13'. Ridley Scott's 'The Martian' dealt with a similar situation but the film spanned a longer amount of time.You can't make a journey when the run-time is one hour and half, but I guess it was the longest such a thin premise could be sustained: one hour and half rightfully divided into three half-an- hours. First, she still benefits from the advice and company of wisecracking George Clooney, half-an hour of loneliness, and half-an hour of a climax, and some existential and emotional undertones. It works for the most part and again, the performance of Sandra Bullock strikes the right emotional chord, but there are many moments that can only feel as fillers and you know 'Gravity' only shines through its first and third act, but is rather unsatisfying in the middle. I feel a bit guilty to criticize the story when there's so much to praise on the special effects, but the effects are just vehicles for the story. In 'Gravity', you feel like the opposite is happening. And when she gets home, she's triumphant and we're happy for her, but for some reason, I expected that to happen and I wasn't as emotionally overwhelmed as I expected. I didn't know what exactly was lacking in the film, to be honest, so I wondered whether it was one that could only benefit from a big screen viewing, and there's would be no comparison with a TV or DVD experience.I don't think a film can be so spectacular to lose its entertaining value on smaller screen and actually, it's thanks to the very DVD of the film that I could pinpoint the problem, or let's just say, the wasted opportunity. When I saw the bonus features and the documentary about the Kessler syndrome, I was mesmerized and I enjoyed that half-an-hour more than the film itself. That was something I didn't know. I didn't know space has turned to a real junkyard ever since the conquest of the air by the irresponsibility of men, and the risk of collision between satellites is increasing and might provoke damage of exponentially spectacular effects, each collision creating debris increasing the likelihood of bigger collisions, hence making in the short term, all the satellite useless, and God knows how satellites have became indispensable in our technology-driven era. Now, that would have made one hell of a disclaimer because this is exactly what takes off the action, and this is something that could scare us more than anything. We relate to Stone as humans, but we all directly relate to the satellite issue. Even more, why the hell did they choose as a cause like a Russian satellite destroyed, how about a collision between satellites to emphasize the tragic randomness of these disasters? 'Gravity' should have raised this awareness not diminish its impact by choosing an accidental cause. Now, I don't know how the collision case could have been handled within Stone's misadventure but it could have worked nonetheless, since space is such a 'crowded' place. Cuaron had a lot of material to work on, but he picked the easy choice and seemed in a rush to conclude the film. Maybe the effects were too big to maintain them for two hours, but still, it didn't give him time to work on some little flaws such as Clooney's performance or the timing of the oxygen level. These moments felt so 'cinematic' in a film that tries to border on realism and the one moment that felt realistic was the communication with that Eskimo father, but then again, it took me the DVD features to understand what was going on. Would have showing the Eskimos ruined the premise of the film? I respect the choice of Cuaron but in the end, the story suffers a bit from a rushed directing.And what stays in the film is the excellence of the special effects, so the flaws of the story are no 'gravity' case, but the film isn't a masterpiece for all that.",7,0,1,21 December 2016
To Be or Not to Be," Fiction can make fun of reality, that's the revenge of reason over barbarity...
","'To Be or Not To Be' doesn't trivialize the barbarity of the Nazi regime as much as it ennobles art and gives an aura of metaphysical importance to laughter, as the main characteristic of the reasonable person. It's precisely because Ernst Lubitsch could laugh at the Nazism that one shouldn't underestimate the sadness and terror that devoured his soul. One could say the same about Chaplin's 'Great Dictator', more focused on the inner heroism of the little people while Lubitsch' movie is a love letter to artists, and the work of a true one.Lubitsch grew up in Berlin and became an acting sensation after World War I before becoming one of the most promising directors of Hollywood. A precocious talent with a sense of sophistication that would be known as the 'Lubitsch touch', he was probably under the influence of that boost of creativity and flamboyance that made Berlin an artistic Mecca in the early 30s (like in Bob Fosse's 'Cabaret'). His film opens on Warsaw, a more suitable place for free art once Germany surrendered to swastikas. And as if he anticipated the criticism over his subject, the story features a play named 'The Gestapo' and satirizing the Nazis. During a rehearsal, the man playing Hitler (Irish actor Tom Dugan) delivers a hilarious and unexpected 'Heil myself'. The line gets cut by the director who makes it a matter of ethics not to make Nazis funny, much to the actor's reluctance.Basically, Lubitsch asks us the question: should we sacrifice a good line for the sake of seeming decency? How many times haven't we felt the necessity to cross the barrier of good taste because it was so tempting. So the line is censored because of the risk of offending Hitler and when the Germans come on a day of September 1939, the play is cancelled once and for all. The situation resonates like Churchill's parable about war and dishonour, fearing the Nazis is the dishonourable attitude, even when meant to play safe, you're never safe with them, so let's just use your best weapon, guns or gags it doesn't matter. While I was wondering if Lubitsch would have been as loose on the Nazis if he knew about the Camps, I was hiding a chuckle because the line 'so they call me Concentration Camp Ehrhardt' kept springing to my mind. Should I feel guilty?No less than for any movie that dared to turn the subject into laughing matter, from Donald Duck's 'Der Fuerher's Face' to 'La Vita e Bella'. It's because Nazis were human that their crimes were horrific, it's because they were human that they should be mocked. Art is the triumph of the intellect over the brutal force, the sensitivity over cynicism, it can be sophisticated and fancy but it can't really do without powerful sentiments, this is why the film makes a good use of Shakespeare's lines (borrowed from 'Hamlet' and 'The Merchant of Venice') and even more why it focuses on a married couple, the greatest actress of Poland Maria Tura (Carole Lombard) and her hammy husband Joseph (Jack Benny). The film opens with a sort of vaudevillian mood where Maria exploits her husband's 'Hamlet' soliloquy to bring the handsome aviator Sobinski (Robert Starck) to her room, the running gag is not overused so Marie doesn't appear too cheap and Joseph too dumb.There's a fine balance between the romance and the screwball situations and they all get along with the intricacies of a plot that involves a sinister but seductive spy named Professor Siletski (Stanley Ridges), who proposes Maria to become an agent. Meanwhile, the troop must absolutely capture the man, confiscate the documents that contain names of Polish Resistant members and get rid of the spy, and this is where their Nazi costumes get quite handy. So we see Jack benny and all his friends impersonating Nazi officers and even Selitski with variable effects, sometimes with the right timing, sometimes a delay force them to rewrite the script. In a sort of meta-referential nod to his own art, Lubitsch directs actors playing directors, actors and writers, proving that sometimes a good act can be a matter of life and death. Hammy too much and your cover is blown if not your head. Maria proves to be a more restrained actress so she can dodge the Nazis' flair, same can't be said about Joseph and Benny's antics endanger the film's credibility in their exaggerated audacity, the man pushes his luck so often it's a wonder how he did survive.The film also suffers from a series of contrivances that happen all too conveniently near the end leading to a rushed climax only redeemed by the hilarious ending. Still, the real black spot in the film's legacy is of course the haunting of Carole Lombard's memory. The actress died in a plane crash a few weeks after the film's release, the USA had just entered the war and she was collecting bonds during a tour across America. In a way, she was a victim of that war though she lived far from the ruins and ashes of Poland, her death cut one of the most promising careers short and made Gable so inconsolable he joined the war too... I avoided that film for a long time because of that story, it had saddened me a lot even more because I happen to be afraid of flying.I couldn't believe how many times she referred to flights during the film, the simple fact that she loved an aviator gives it an eerie feeling, it's just as if the film was doomed to be clouded by tragedy, individual and universal. However, and that might be the secret of 'To Be or Not to Be', It's all fiction, it's not reality, the film was criticized when the war was still raging and now it's a classic, once reality is as dead as fiction, what remains is the essence of art.as",8,1,1,25 June 2019
Monty Python's Life of Brian," The Prime of Monty Python ...
","1969 was a great year for British comedy, the Benny Hill Show started and so did Monty Python's Flying Circus, marking the debut of the surreal comedy group featuring, in order of heights, John Cleese, Graham Chapman, Eric Idle, Michael Palin and the two Terries, Gilliam and Jones, and they were so groundbreaking they made the word 'Pythonesque' exist.But let's still play with numbers, 1969 was the debut and sadly, in 1989, untimely passing of Graham Chapman, marked the end of an era and annihilated any chance for further reunions. So the number '9' is pretty significant in the history of the group, and it's all fitting that the year that goes in-between constitutes the prime of Monty Python, because it was the year of 'Life of Brian' and because, I believe this is the film that expressed their yearning to irreverent, absurd, surrealist but ultimately intelligent comedy to the fullest. And I put the emphasis on 'intelligent'.Indeed, it is commonly know that 'drama' appeals to the heart, while 'comedy' appeals to the intellect. We love to laugh because the mechanism that allows us to do so pass by the brain, and you can't fool it nor take any shortcut, it's a hit-or-miss, So it all comes down to one thing: if something makes people laugh and think, then if it doesn't make you laugh, think of the reason first. Obviously, 'Life of Brian' didn't make everyone laugh, because scholars, religious, Catholics thought the movie made fun of Jesus. Well, if one thing, the film is about Brian, not Jesus, Jesus only shows up twice in the film and he's never mocked or ridiculed, his divinity seems quite undisputed on the contrary.'Life of Brian' is irreverent and has a rather nasty attitude toward religion, but let's make our brain work a little. I discovered the movie in Latin class, because the teacher wanted to show us the 'Romane, Ite Domum', moment (which was grammatically accurate) and it was so hilarious we asked him to let the film play for the rest of the hour. I finished the film later, but I owe my discovery to Latin, so it's all fitting that Latin makes me understand the movie too, and here's how. Religion comes from two Latin words: 'relego' as reading a second time, and 'religo': assembling people. And this is what religion is about, interpreting things (reading again), and finding a sort of mystical strength and communion in unity.For the 'relego', you have the emblematic sequence of Bryan being taken for a prophet and no matter what he says, or he leaves behind, even a shoe, people keep on finding reasons to sanctify him. If he on an old man's foot and breaks his vow of silence, the crowd shouts: 'it's a miracle', and they're ready to lynch the old man when he starts hitting Bryan. This is the 'religo' effect on crowds, and 'Life of Brian' is perhaps the only film featuring a dialogue between one person and a crowd. And when people shout all in unison 'we'll think by ourselves', you have the maddening effect of religion, and perhaps the only one truth of the film: a crowd is incapable to be rational. And that doesn't apply to religion but even the Judean Front rebels kept insulting the Romans while incapable to think of one negative thing the Occupation brought.That's exactly the sensitive subject 'Life of Brian' is dealing with, it's not about Christ, it is about a context, a crazy contest where the value of one's life was so cheap people had to give a meaning to death, and vice versa. You have a foretaste with the hilarious stoning scene where most of the stoners, are women wearing fake beards, so not even women are immune to these practices. Nothing has changed much although civilization allowed people to wise up a little, but even religious guys should gentlemanly reckon that religion calls for more complex reactions than blind faiths, especially if these reaction make people laugh, and not even at the prophet, but just a misunderstood alter-ego.The film was funny and intelligent enough not to mock for the sake of mocking; this is why I maintain that it is the prime of Monty Python. I read some commentators saying it wasn't as funny as they expected, or not just 'Holy Grail'. Well, 'Holy Grail' was one of the funniest movies of all-time, so it would have been difficult to beat it only four years later, but 'Life of Brian' was busy with a plot, it did rely on Monty Python's usual zaniness (a surreal alien space sequence, the bargaining part, Pilate's lisp to the belly-laugh inducing Biggus Dickus part) but it told a story with a beginning, a middle and an end ('Grail' has the two thirds right) and it even afforded the luxury to include a romantic interlude and one dramatic performance, not the least because it's Graham Chapman's. As the titular hero, Chapman is really the straight-man of a world that turned crazy, and his performance is integral to the film's appeal.While Chapman is the soul of the film (and the only member who doesn't go into hundreds of disguise) the other Pythons are perfect in their respective field, actors and director, and the one with a little more musical talent provided the film's (or the groups') upbeat signature song and one of the most memorable movies' endings. It is ironic in the context of the film, but while they're singing, and whistling, we can't help but think of it as a happy ending, because indeed, we should always look at the bright side of life and so should the critics.And maybe this is the second truth of the film. The song would be later performer during Graham Chapman's funeral and only the Pythons could make a sad event such a joyful moment, and this the intelligence of the heart.",10,0,1,16 August 2016
Erin Brockovich," A 'Norma Rae' and 'Silkwood', it ain't ...
","In 1974, in 'A Woman Under the Influence', Gena Rowlands gave one of the most extraordinary female performances ever as a woman alienated by her desire to please everyone, yet lost the Oscar to Ellen Burstyn, a struggling mother in 'Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore'.In 2000, in 'Requiem For a Dream', Ellen Burstyn gave one of the most extraordinary female performances ever as a woman alienated by her desire to please everyone, yet lost the Oscar to Julia Roberts, a struggling mother in 'Erin Brokovich'.Hollywood must have a thing for struggling mothers, I guess. But Julia Roberts' acting didn't convince me on that particular area, call it the anger from knowing that her performance beat up Ellen Busrtyn's heart-breaking performance, I call it the 'boobs' effect. Once we got that Erin Brokovich was a free-spirited single mother who loved to dress with tight skirts and deep décolleté highlighting her beautiful assets, could that be made a little bit less distracting, for plot's sake? The film had the premise: an uneducated woman crusading against a California power lawsuit accused of poisoning water's supply and ultimately triumphing, far from the tragic heroine figure sacrificing herself, she gets the largest settlement ever paid in a direct action and her life financially improves (I hope her wardrobe tastes did too, from what I saw, it did, sexy outfits, but expensive ones).Anyway, that kind of 'David vs. Goliath' story is pure gold for Hollywood, and Steven Soderbergh was right to believe in it, even 'Erin Brokovich' sounded more cinematic than any fictional name. But since the story is already phenomenal, why make Erin such a 'remarkable' woman from the very start? Why not allow Julia Roberts' undeniable charisma to disappear within her character?I supposes Soderbergh tried to show some three-dimensionality and even succeeded by questioning whether Erin was motivated by justice or by the selfish desire to be the one (and only one) who pulled the giant on his knees, to prove herself capable. But damn, I couldn't get my eyes of Roberts' breasts all through the film, using Peter Griffin's vocabulary, as far as breasts (and legs, too) were concerned, 'the film insisted upon itself', so much it even diminished the merit of Julia Roberts who's precisely supposed to play that kind of woman, at one point, I wondered whether it was Erin or 'Pretty Woman' I was watching.Burstyn diluted herself in Sara Goldfarb's personality; Roberts relied too much on that superficial facade, as if she (or writers) thought we would only 'love' that she could outsmart smarter people unless we get the total opposite feeling from the beginning. I know this film is supposed to make you feel good for the victims of one of the most disgraceful injustices ever, well, I felt good for them, but that was the predictable emotional pay-off, everything that happened before was handled like 'obligatory plot devices', each time, in an over-the-top way.Starting with the heroine: the struggling mother, the ultimate female 'underdog' figure, she lives alone with three children and doesn't trust men, because they all treated her like crap, and women in her office aren't any kinder. Maybe we're supposed to empathize with Erin, while we know every single woman who appears with these outskirts would not be watched with trustful eyes. But that's okay, she has the right to be the way she is, no matter how hypocritical it is to flash her (beautiful) body so eagerly and then wanting to be judged for smarts.The irony here is that her clothes do make a point sometimes. For instance, when she goes to the water company and tries to flirt with the guy behind the counter to get some incriminating files, it makes sense, but she's always dressed like that, so, the point is lost. Let's get back to the clichés' department, at one point, Erin falls in love with George, a tough biker, but the guy doesn't provide anything to the film apart from being a plot-filler. Just compare Aaron Eckhart's role with Sam Elliot in 'Mask' and you get the idea, the screenplay turned realistic stuff into pure fictionalized drama.That's not even the worst, George pushes her to abandon the case when she's threatened. Maybe that's what happened in real life, but the way it was handled in the film was painfully unrealistic. Couldn't Erin tell George what her fight was about? I would have believed such a considerate man would respect Erin's efforts and even try to help her but no! He was selfishly complaining about the time she spent outside, and naturally, when he left, I don't know who couldn't see that coming.The same unrealistic stuff happens again with Ed Masri, her employer played by Albert Finney. He fires Erin after three unjustified days off. He could have asked for explanations, or she could at least tell him, it would have cleared the misunderstanding. No, that was too convenient and we had to wait for five or ten minutes again. And I can go on and on, when the case is given to a bigger lawyer's office, one of the new assignees try to get in touch the plaintiffs, we know, it's a matter of time before Erin gets back on the road again.The material wasn't revolutionary, and the film is relatively honest in the way it handles the case, no surprise witness, no spectacular revelation, no physical threats apart from the phone call. But the writing, directing and acting should have learned one thing or two from the 'New Hollywood' era. Something like 'Norma Rae' or 'Silkwood' for instance, but there's a quality in Sally Field and Meryl Streep that lacks in the 2000's Julia Roberts, and this is not a critic, Roberts is superb, but for once, she's victim of her superbness.",7,0,1,27 September 2013
Meet the Parents," The 's' at the end of the title is useless ...
","Just when I thought that 'fat, drunk and stupid' wasn't the way to 'go through life', cinema provided me the perfect example of a man doomed for failure. His name? Gaylord Focker. His profession? Male nurse. How does he look? Slightly below average, but a Tom Cruise, he ain't, if you except some pretty blue eyes no really, he looks like that poor schmuck who thought he had a chance with Cameron Diaz in 'There's Something About Mary'  see? What else from that glorious portrait? Well, he's in love with Pam (Teri Polo), a pretty blonde from a Conservative WASP family, and being Jewish wouldn't help either. Except that she loves him, she would probably say 'yes' if he manages to propose her, granted Pam's sister doesn't steal her thunder and the ring doesn't get lost with the luggage in the airport  yes, I forgot to mention Greg (that's how they call him) is also unlucky but that was quite easy to find out. Anyway, Pam loves him and her sister's wedding seems like the perfect opportunity to introduce Greg. Except that opportunity doesn't rhyme with formality, there has to be a catch otherwise, the film wouldn't be one of the funniest of the 2000's.The catch is a hard-nosed man in his early sixties, who loves his wife Dina (Blythe Danner), his two daughters and Jinx, his Siamese cat. He's over-protective and over-suspicious, he's a Conservative Christian, and much more than this, he's an ex-CIA Agent. His name is Jack Byrnes and he's played by Bobby De Niro, who else could? 'Meet the Parents' all relies on the antagonism between Greg and Jack and it follows a simple yet effective pattern: whatever Greg does, he'll be ridiculous. No matter how hard he'll try to make himself within the family circle, Jack's beloved concept, he'll end up displeasing him. It feels like a one-note approach to the subject, but for some miraculous reason, it never feels redundant and here's why.The credit goes to Jay Roach, the director, each scene prepares us to a funny pay-off. Secondly, there's not one single 'funny' character, they're all, within their own state of mind, normal and well-meaning persons. One might argue that a CIA agent who trained his cat to use the toilet might be a little twisted, or a name like Gaylord Focker is too funny not to belong to a goof-ball, but fact is, there's no clown in the film, the two opposite leads are straight men with clearly defined personalities. The average schmuck who wants to propose the blonde daughter and must get the approval of the father, and the conservative father who believes his baby girl deserves the best.The comedic situations result in all the interactions between Greg and Jack, and their one-sided attempts to get along. There is a family dinner scene that crystallizes whatever is funny in the film, Greg tries to make a joke, he ends up insulting Greg's mother, he start talking about a random subject such as 'milking' cat, making the gesture as if we didn't get it, and arguing that you can milk anything with nipples to which Jack's 'I have nipples, Greg. Could you milk me?' is the perfect comeback and the film's most memorable line. There's also a jar containing Jack's mother ashes which makes us expect the worst but the point is to laugh, not at Greg, but at his desperate attempts to accommodate with his soon-to-be family-in-law. The film is never mean-spirited, well, maybe a little but, but we never laugh in a mean-spirited way I think soI believe one of the reasons the film succeeds is because the recurring theme is being an outsider, which is a situation most viewers can relate to. And meeting the parents of your beloved one is probably one of the nightmares everyone must get through once in the life, the issue is undermined by Greg's differences, which are never mocked, he's proud of his job, which is all to his honor. He's Jewish but accepts to say the blessing, although it doesn't really turn out as we'd expect. The point is that there are more cultural gaps in America than anyone would believe, and at a time, where 'mixed' marriages are so common, it's also something many can relate to. And God, what can be worst than a lie detector test from your father in law? The film introduces Pam's sister and her future husband, a doctor (a real one, from Jack's perspective), the ideal man for his daughter, there's also Owen Wilson as a priest and carpenter who lived a passionate romance with Pam, 'only physical' (was that supposed to comfort him?) and Jack's son who'd be responsible for a minor drugs' subplot, not the best part of the film. Indeed, it loses its pacing at some point where Greg becomes the public enemy number one, Greg, but then it takes us to a hilarious airplane climax where Greg finally goes berserk and vent his anger out on flight attendants and a last and final confrontation with Jack.Ben Stiller has already proved his value as a character –actor for poor and well-meaning schmucks, he reprises his role from 'There's Something About Mary' but gives it an even deeper feeling. De Niro has no comparable talent to make fun of his own intimidating presence and knows how to parody his own gangster mimics for grabbing a few laughs. He was rightfully nominated for the Golden Globe. Blythe Danner also provides a sweet touch as the understanding mother who asks Jack to 'go easy on Greg', but fate is that no matter what can go wrong, it all go wrong. Murphy's law indeed.And if one thing, the film proves right the idea that marrying someone, no matter what we want, is also marrying the family.",8,1,2,13 January 2014
Mulan," If 'Mulan' was made today...
","If 'Mulan' was made today, instead of reviewing her lesson for the Lady matchmaker, she would be found trying some new moves with her father's sword. And the song 'Reflection' would include a chorus where Fa Mulan would pull a 'Let it Go' and say 'But What I (Really) Want is...'.If 'Mulan' was made today, the grandmother would have sided with Mulan all along and encourage her to follow her dreams. Which leads me to think that she wouldn't have alerted the family when Mulan left home to go fighting instead of Fa Zhou and maybe we wouldn't even have Mushu.Speaking of Mushu, if 'Mulan' was made today, we certainly wouldn't have Eddie Murphy as the voice actor. Though I'm not sure they would have made the effort to cast one Asian actor for every single character, the scene-stealing sidekick would have certainly been voiced by an Asian-American star. And why not? Listening to the little red dragon, I was wondering whether it was Axel Folley or the Donkey who got caught in a time loop that took him to the Han dynasty... and I wonder why they didn't try to get Jackie Chan for the part (was he that busy with 'Rushmore'?)If 'Mulan' was made today, we wouldn't have the cricket because he would be as needless in 2018 than he was in 1998...If 'Mulan' was made today, she would have been a natural-born warrior impressing the soldiers with her skills from the very start instead of being that 'adorkable' unexperienced maiden trying to pass for a man. Everything would have been done to tone-down the effect of her cross-dressing and reduce it to the cutting of her hair.Speaking of which, if 'Mulan' was made today, I'm not sure we'd have that badass synthetized score during the dressing moment. Not even sure we'd have so much music that scream 'Nineties' (and yes, it came from Jerry Goldsmith, of all the composers!)If 'Mulan' was made today, a song like 'Like a Man' wouldn't exist. (I wish they would keep the tune though because it's catchy as hell).If 'Mulan' was made today, Shan-Yu wouldn't have been turned into such a scary-looking villain in case it might offend Hunnish populations.Now that one is risky: if 'Mulan' was made today, would there be a romance? Would they keep the character of the young captain Shan?Let's face it, 'Mulan' is perhaps one of the few Disney movies where we don't get one but two heroes and Shang even follows a character arc as he starts as an inexperienced and prejudiced soldier trying to fit in his father's shoes to a more tolerant person. Mulan and Shang form a rather interesting 'Yin and Yang' duo and I wonder if he would have been kept or just turned into some ruthless leader wrongly opinioned about women.Still, let's stick to the romance. If 'Mulan' was made today, would they have abandoned any prospect of a romantic relationship and avoid the possibility of two male-looking soldiers being romantically involved. Disney has so much to show, so many grounds to break, so many taboos to fight, that I don't think they would have missed that opportunity for one of the few stories involving cross-dressing. So I'll stick to my guns and say there would be a romance.That said, if 'Mulan' was made today, the romance would be one-sided and wouldn't distract Mulan from her mission. Well, as long as they keep that hilarious and risquÃ© 'river-bathing' scene...Now, of course, if 'Mulan' was made today, it would be in 3D.But if 'Mulan' was made today, the Great Wall of China would look even greater but I don't think they could have made a more impressive sequence than Huns' epic riding over the mountains. This has got to be one of the most beautiful Disney shots from any movie ever on a pure Eisensteinian or Kurosawan level.If 'Mulan' was made today, she would still save the day by causing an avalanche but maybe the writers would have found a better way for our heroes to survive. I want Mulan, Shang, Mushu and the other fellows to live like the next watcher but there are so many insults to the laws of probability in three minutes of the avalanche sequences than maybe all the Renaissance Disney pictures of Disney. And my disbelief was suspended by a looser rope than the one thrown from over a cliff to land on Harvey Fiernstein's head.If 'Mulan' was made today, the climax would have kept the concubine cross-dressing but would have ended with an iron-crossing fight between Mulan and Shao-li.If 'Mulan' was made today, she would have accepted the job as the Emperor's counselor and never get back home to become a maiden again. Hell, Shang wouldn't have followed her. Wait a minute, of course he wouldn't have... since he's not supposed to exist so it all makes sense that Mulan ends up a counselor, then a general, then maybe the new Empress of China.In fact, if 'Mulan' was made today, there would be at least two or three extra female characters, maybe Shao-li would have a daughter who would have been the real nemesis, maybe Mulan would have a little sister (all right I cheated for that one) or maybe the empowering message would have been even more explicit, like 'Brave', 'Frozen' and 'Moana' and would make 1998 Mulan original look like Snow White...My question is: are there any girls who still don't give a damn about being warriors? Mulan did that out of love for her father and I just hope that will still be the key motive in the 2020 versions but I do expect a few changes to remind me how far we are from 1998... when Mulan was considered a progressive movie.It's a matter of opinion but I believe it is.",8,0,0,18 November 2018
Se7en," Atypical ... Disturbing ... Haunting ...
","'Se7en' is one of these cinematic rarities that elevate themselves to unsuspected levels of depth after each viewing, in the greatest tradition of film noir and detective mysteries. Like 'Chinatown', it reinvented the noir genre with its own particular atmosphere, both were and are still atypical for their time, and both end with a case solved, yet a puzzling conclusion.'Se7en' is less about the series of crimes committed than the two men who lead the investigation, and the way their relationship evolves and highlights their respective approach to life, to death, to the world they live in, with an implicitness that respects our intelligence enough so we can respect the film in return. This intelligence (or subtlety) is not immediately palpable, and the opening scene can mislead some viewers by falsely establishing the sort of odd couple we'd expect in a cop team: the wise veteran and the hot-headed youngster. Of course, you can trust David Fincher's directing and the cleverness of the script because there's much more to say about Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt in these two roles, among the best of their careers.Morgan Freeman is Sommerset, a cop in his last week before retirement but not THE typical cop about to retire, (as a matter of fact, nothing is typical in 'Se7en'), he's a law enforcer who never fired in 34 years of service and never got shot either, quite an achievement for someone who doesn't work in the most secure neighborhood. Sommerset incarnates the typical noir protagonist, whose optimism was eroded by years and years of facing and fighting the most sordid crimes. Although he's not the most likely to have faith in humanity, he's not cynical because he still respects his job. However, he's lucid about one thing, as long as there will be men, there will be rapists, killers, and criminals of the worst species. Sommerset is lucid and competent, he's like a spotlight of hope in a gloomy darkness, and that's enough to gain our respect, he's calm even when facing the most horrific and gruesome crimes, like the poor obese man forced to eat to death.This opening crime is spectacular and graphic, but Fincher restrains himself because the horror is sometimes more efficient when it's suggested. The horrific aspect of the first crime is also distracted by the first interactions with Mills, Brad Pitt, as the replacing Detective. Mills is not a rookie, he's got his share of thrills and he knows his business. The problem is his temper: too cocky, too hot-headed, too sure of himself, he can't stand Sommerset's patronizing attitude. The progress of the investigation depends on the partnership between Mills and Sommerset, so they do their best to accommodate each other but it's only when Sommerset is invited to dinner by Mills' wife Tracy, that the ice is broken. Tracy here is essential, and not just as a simple plot device, she's a sweet and caring housewife, beautifully played by Gwyneth Paltrow. Tracy loves her husband and provides the extra level of depth needed to appreciate Mills' character who's more one-dimensional in contrast with Sommerset.Tracy is the emotional connection between the viewers and Mills, and consequently between Mills and Sommerset, she's the heart of the film, and plays like an efficient counterpart to the gloomy atmosphere we're plunged in since the very start, it's no wonder that she 'hates the place', she embodies hope, family, marriage, loyalty, the best in humanity. And that's the most brilliant aspect of 'Se7en', especially from a 29-year old director: David Fincher, with a remarkable craftsmanship, establishes all the elements of the puzzle in the first half-hour, setting the atmosphere: a rainy, dark and totally unappealing little town. It's a hellish, nightmarish world where we're plunged, where only feeble spotlights can penetrate a nightmarish darkness, it's one of these places, you're afraid to walk like in a dark room where you can accidentally put your foot on a sleeping cockroach. Talk about a hostile atmosphere.But this atmosphere is perfect because it fits the nature of the crimes committed, and creates the disturbing urge to establish a peaceful relationship between Mills and Sommerset, which coincides with the discovery of the first two murder's links: a fat man is killed by eating, a successful lawyer forced to trade parts of his body to (temporarily) spare his live, two words written in various parts: Gluttony, Greed  an obvious 'to be continued' message to the cops. So, everything leads to the conclusion that the crimes are related to the seven deadly sins, and this time, it's not a killer who kills, but, as states Sommerset: a killer who preaches. But Mills calls a spade a spade, and by labeling the unknown man as 'demented' and 'crazy', he lamentably clouds his judgment while Sommerset is more rational and tries to think like the killer. Mills is all about emotional reactions, Sommerset thinks before he acts, impulses and reason, interestingly, it's the former who believes in love and family, as if 'passion' could work like a double-edged sword.The atypical nature of the crimes and their author elevate the film, Sommerset goes to library to try to find out hints in Saint-Augustin's books, Dante's Inferno and other medieval and metaphysical classics. Though 'Se7en' doesn't necessarily go deeper in the subject but it touched them enough to carry a sort of pedagogical value. We might not read all these books after, but I'm sure many of us, would question their approach to some crucial religious notions like faith, forgiveness, innocence and passion. On that level, the film is not just a cat-and-mouse thriller; it's also a descent into the most hellish aspects of humanity, incarnated by the villain's face, what's more with a perfect conclusion, leaving us with a truly awkward and uncomfortable sensation, free enough to see the half-full or half-empty glass.Again, 'Se7en' is a film that respects the viewer's intelligence.",10,4,6,11 June 2012
Wayne's World," Too weird to be true, but Wayne and Garth rock ... and roll too ...
","Once upon a time in Aurora (Illinois), in a modest basement : 'Wayne's World! Wayne's World! Party On! Excellent!' 'Extreme close up''Waaaaaaah'  Ahhh,.. 'Wayne's World', as one of its several number-one fans, I have so many things to say that I really don't know how to handle it. Well, how about the mega-pompous over-insightfully wannabe Ebert approach, with a nostalgic and teary eye: THE MEGA-POMPOUS OVER-INSIGHTFULLY WANNABE-EBERT APPROACH, WITH A NOSTALGIC AND TEARY EYE: To assert my cinematic knowledge; I would say that 'Wayne's World' is probably to the 90's what 'Car Wash' was to the 70's, the comedic encapsulation of a spirit that today prevails  not, with Rock'n'Roll and Heavy Metal replacing Funk and Disco as the two musical pillars conveying the nostalgic feeling of the early 90's. 'Wayne's World' is so dedicated to music, to the very spirit that made music indispensable in those excessive post-Berlin wall consumerist days, that not only it rocked on that level, but rolled, too.But more than a film about music, 'Wayne's World' is the ode for a whole generation that grew up with 'Scooby Doo' and 'Sesame Street' and was still sucking the thumbs of the eighties at the dawn of the electronic era. Those were the times were the net was still synonym of fishing, and when Zuckerberg was still watching 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'. In a nutshell, 'Wayne's World' is to Cinema what 'Smell Like Teen Spirit' was to Rock.But I guess if Mike Myers was told that his film was the best that ever captured the spirit of the X-generation, he would modestly answer with a suave and solemn voice: 'I was not aware of that!'. Indeed, twenty years later, many viewers look at the film with a nostalgic eye and say 'hey, this is how it used to be' but that's only one (and probably unintentional) secondary level, in fact, when you watch 'Wayne's World', it's a whole other dimension that cuts straight to you.THE EMOTIONAL INTROSPECTION INTO WAYNE AND GARTH'S INSPIRINGLY SELF-REFLEXIVE INTERACTION: Watching 'Wayne's World' is an excellent antidote against bad mood, you're simply having a great time following the crazy adventures of Wayne Campbell, the host of a (feeble according to Benjamin) TV public-access cable show of the same name, with his sidekick and best friend Garth Algar. Mike Meyers (in his film debut) and Dana Carvey play one of the most recognizable duos of the 90's and probably the funnier and gentler, as nothing is more exhilarating than watching them making fun of their host, playing road-hockey, lying on the Mirthmobile waiting for planes to land, elaborating the most philosophical statements about girls, music and life, and last but not least, visiting Milwaukee.The film sets the tone very quickly when Wayne starts talking to the camera, the fourth-wall-breaking is one of the film's greatest delights as if it was aware of its own cleverness enough to push the self-derision button, making fun of its own ending, plot devices, and getting away with one of the most blatant cases of product placements... that actually worked and became an instant classic. The talking-to-the-camera is also a perfect invitation to join this group and its communicative fun  ON THE QUOTABILITY 1-10 SCALE, THIS GOES TO ELEVEN  It's irreverent but never vulgar, intelligent but not inaccessible, childish but not annoying, the humor displayed in 'Wayne's World' shares the same goofiness than some Zucker or Brooks' parodies, but it defines something new, beyond the jokes and the inventive vocabulary how 'shall' I put it? Well, many lines can lead to cringe-worthy silences or awkward 'What the hell does that mean?' pauses but in 'Wayne's World', for some reason, the weirdest lines work. Garth might sound a bit too one-dimensional but the way he delivers his 'Hi!' and 'Thank you' is a no-cringe guarantee, and don't even get me started on Mike Myers who can make people laugh with lines as stupid as 'Esquueze me? A baking powder?' just as Jim Carrey can afford to play an obnoxious character like 'Ace Ventura' and keep it funny. When you got talent, you can get away with everything.The film features one classic or priceless line every 30 seconds and in fact, let me rewrite this chapter's title, it's : ON THE QUOTABILITY 1-10 SCALE, THIS GOES TO ELEVEN, ON THE MEMORABILITY, TO TWELVE !The great Howard Hawks said it himself: 'a good movie is three good scenes and zero bad scene', then Wayne's World is a triumph on the field of comedic film-making. Penelope Spheeris directed one of the funniest American comedies, opening it with the emblematic 'Bohemian Rhapsody' lip-synching scene. And till now, whenever the instrumental part starts, I feel like frenetically banging my head.The film also includes a great cast, Rob Lowe as the antagonistic slick small TV exec and womanizer, and Tia 'Schwing!' Cassandra, a beautiful Chinese singer. Good thing they avoided the obvious stereotype of a pretty blonde chick, and made her more exotic if only for the Cantonese quotes' gags, that lead to one of the most obscure and hilarious line when they order Cantonese food. The film features many great cameos, among them, a notable performance from Alice Cooper, Alice Cooper who'll help me to conclude this expose by paraphrasing one of the film's most brilliant exchanges : 'In fact, is it 'Wayne's World' one of the all-time funniest movies?''Yes, Pete it is'(PS1: the film made it in Gene Siskel's Top 10 movies from 1992, so believe me, it IS worthy! it IS worthy!)(PS2: this review contains 10 superlatives and too many adverbs, it is so incredibly badly written)(PS3: have you noticed that the review's title is a haiku?)",10,6,11,11 June 2012
The Big Lebowski," The Fun, Bearable Lightness of Bowling...
","As guys, we've all been through this Bohemian times, where we could keep the same underwear for the week, and bed sheets for the month, when the toilet seat could be left open and we could do whatever we wanted in the bathtub without a nagging female voice interrupting our meditation. But now that we settled down, it's with nostalgic eyes that we remember the time we could be guys in the lousiest and laziest meaning of the world, and venerate the one who made this attitude a lifestyle, a state of mind, a philosophy. His name is Jeff Lebowksy aka the Dude, a name fittingly rhyming with attitude, and he's played by the namesake Bridges in the signature role his career much needed.Indeed, who needs motives, personal backgrounds, goals and all that screen writing hogwash when you have an attitude. The attitude makes the characters who make the film, and that's the way the Coen brothers have it with 'The Big Lebowski', bizarrely overlooked at the time of its release, but whose brilliance blossomed in our minds after we got rid of all our preconceived cinematic notions and started to appreciate the laziest character of L.A. But while the Californian urban landscape is integral to the film's 'narrative', I think every man in a way or another can relate to the Dude, starting with his appearance. Basically, he looks like a bum, with his long leonine hair, his shaggy goatee, his Bermudas shorts, flip-flops and bathrobes, but here's a guy who (obviously) is the antithesis of the metro-sexual figure, and that's enough a reason to love him.What matters for the Dude is to go bowling with his team: Walter Sobchak (John Goodman) and Donnie (Steve Buscemi) and enjoying a White Russian cocktail. Walter is a Nam vet and the kind of friends that make you wish for enemies, and Donnie is the space filler who can't align three sentences before being told to 'shut the **** up'. You think it's crazy to hang out with such guys? I have a friend like Walter, and no matter how much of a bastard he could be, we 'forgot about it' while playing pool. Bowling, pool or poker, the point is that if guys were given the opportunity, they would pick fun and idleness as ways of life. And if it was up to the Dude, there would be no plot, two guys could beat and water-board him, he'd let them go the minute they knew it was the wrong Lebowski, but one committed a mistake, he peed on the rug, the one that 'tied the room together'.The film is set during the Gulf War, so when he shares his misadventure, Walter paraphrases Bush Sr. and tells the Dude that they crossed the line and he's entitled to demand reparation. If the Dude is the extreme of men's capability to live without rules, Walter is the total opposite and can't envision life without a sense of ethos. He can't play on the Shabbat day even though he's not Jewish, but like he says, just because he divorced from his Jewish wife doesn't mean he should give back the library card. Walter is so wrapped up in his self-righteousness (he point a gun on a player who can't admit he crossed the line) that he's the one who makes the plot move forward, much to the Dude's annoyance. Goodman is the Laurel to Bridges' Hardy and you can't count how many times the Dude realizes the nice mess, he's been gotten into. And the mess all starts with the 'rug' situation.So, the Dude complains to the Big Lebowski (the late David Huddleston) a tycoon who incarnates the American capitalist dream, and except for his legs, lost in Korea, he has everything: money, power, influence a philanthropic foundation and Bunny, a trophy wife played by Tara Reid. The Big Lebowski throws the 'little' one out of his office, but the Dude tells his spineless assistant (played by the late Philip Seymour Hoffman) that his boss agreed to leave him a rug as compensation. And as far as he was concerned, all was well that ended well for the Dude, and he could focus on the next game with Jesus Quintana, a Hispanic Bowling champ played by the Coen regular Tarantino. Quintana makes quite an impression when he's introduced but the feeling is immediately (and hilariously) contradicted by the little back-story detail Walter provides.But we won't have much of Quintana, because there's more going plot=wise, Bunny is kidnapped, his worried husband hires the Dude as a negotiator, and Maude Lebowski, his daughter (Julianne Moore) takes the rug back (and many other things I wouldn't spoil) . Many critics point out the fact that there's not a real plot, and it doesn't matter, even the narrator (mustached legend Sam Elliott reckoned he's lost his train of thoughts) but I think there's one identifiable pattern in the Big Lebowski, the characters have an attitude, which means, they believe in something tangible. The Dude believed in bowling, Walter in bowling and ethos, Donnie in his friends, the Big Lebowski in principles, his assistant in the Big Lebowski so it's all natural that the closest to villains in the film would be nihilists. It's one thing to do nothing but being driven by nothing is beyond reason.And for all the mess, the Dude and Walter go through, they remains true to their nature and this contrast makes their interaction and situations so damn hilarious, I understand the film needed some musical interludes to let us catch our breath, one of them providing an unforgettable POV shot from within a rolling bowling ball. When knocked up, the Dude only cares for bowling, more than a game, a defining metaphor for the man who slowly rolls over the lane of life. The film also ends on a pure metaphor, because, in bowling terms, 'The Big Lebowski' is a strike!",10,1,3,8 September 2016
Fight Club," Loved and hated ... for the wrong reasons ...
","Let me tell you something about the 'Fight Club' Paradox, it's the uncommon characteristic of a movie victim of its own contradictions. Basically, if you love it, you hate it. If you hate it, you have enough intelligence to get the genius of the film and love it, but if you love it  see? The movie is stuck in the middle of its own vicious circle.And that's my personal dilemma, I was thrilled by the exhilarating prologue and its sardonic social commentary, then the constitution of the underground 'Fight Club' movement intrigued me, but when the concept became a movement that mobilized more masses, and indoctrinated them through an anti-social movement, and a physical self-improvement that flirted with eugenics, I didn't get it, is fascism the answer to liberalism? Or maybe the movie challenged my intelligence and invited me to question my personal approach to both alienating tendencies, highlighting the danger of one through the consequences of the other, with one hell of a prophetic ending. Maybe  I'll try to put myself in the average viewer's shoes :*** I'm David's witty commentary ***'Your life's a joke, you thank whatever God you believe in every Friday for the opportunity to drown in alcohol all the crappiness that defines your life, you, average generation X office worker, trying to bang the generation Y student. The past is over, and there's no future, so the best you can do is seize the day, the night, and empty your bank account to fill your precious living room with some Swedish nonsensical-trema-named furniture. 'I buy therefore I am' this is today's Cogito. Marx defined you through your productive value: either you belonged to the working masses, or the exploiting bourgeoisie. Now, the Dow Jones defines you as a member of the spending masses. You're defined by what you consume, what you own, and what you own ends up owing you. You're owned, man!' *** I'm David's male fantasy ***'You become yourself when you deviate from the model that society dictates to you. The best option is to always take the opposite way. Possession is alienation: stop buying. Self-improvement is masturbation: destroy yourself. Society teaches that fighting and hurting are bad, how can you know yourself if you've never been in a fight? Don't be afraid of blood, scars, pain, these natural scares will cement your spirit. Fear is the lesson about courage, overcome your fear so you can be a man. In a fight, we're all equal, no shirts, no ties, no blue or white collars, no hierarchy; we're all men, united in the same spirit, as a generation lost in no-space, raised by executive women and executed in the altar of liberalism. We must conquer our manhood again. Power, muscles, sweat, testosterone ' *** I'm David's realistic subconscious ***'I want to identify with these guys, to feel the strength to reject and the ability to project myself as a member of this glorious and virile fraternity. But I tried to punch a guy once, I nearly broke my bones, and he nearly sent me to coma by one pinch in the face. Pain hurts to tears. I wanted to become different, I ended up disfigured. Pain hurts, blood is ugly, and sweat stinks. I was fired, I wasn't contributing to the economy anymore, I had my pride. But it couldn't buy me anything. It doesn't matter, whatever you own  yeah, I know but is everything really so bad? Yes it is, what do you want to be, a prototype? Like these perfect guys in the Gucci underwear advertisement, is that what men look alike? Well Tyler sure does. Yeah but it's a representation, he's just an idealization of what the narrator wants to be. Well, Norton isn't bad-looking either. Well, look at the 'Fight Club' members, they're all average Joes with fat bellies and  um ' *** I'm David's manipulative impulse ***'You, poor little schmuck behind your laptop drooling over Brad Pitt's body and fantasizing over being him, you who haven't killed the father yet you dream of knocking out a man who's done nothing to you, as if your fists were made of steel. You can become a man, a member of the Fight Club. All you have to do is to fight, to endure the punches in your face, the blood, the pain, in the modern arena when you'll be either the bull or the toreador. In both cases, you'll win self-respect. Because taking hits is how you learn about resistance. You see, the point is not to help your neighbor, to fight poverty, to help people, but to denounce the dysfunctional aspect of this society, to fight it, to pee on the soup of the guy with the chick, the Rolex and the Ferrari, to shock the innocence with a subliminal phallic image during a fairy tale cartoon, to destroy all the multiple corporate buildings, to exterminate the liberal degeneration of the pointless civilization, to ...' STOOOOOOOOOP! I stop here, because you know where I'm getting at : other groups driven by the same fascist hatred managed to destroy their representation of the liberal world, two years later. Call it political fight, but you can't deny the economical roots of the conflict. Now, I come to my point, the movie works because of its unfortunate prophetic value, I'm sure the movie denounced more than supported, but history proved the premonition to be right. But the average viewer doesn't love the movie for these reasons, because if he would, he would hate it.I love 'Fight Club' because I hate it, call it schizophrenia, I call it the 'Fight Club' paradox. It deserves a 01, I gave it a 10. The rest is just intellectual and/or physical masturbation ... no wonder the tag-line ends with the word 'soap'.",10,1,3,14 July 2011
As Good as It Gets," How good a romantic comedy can get ...
","There is a weird exhilarating feeling watching the compulsive obsessive Melvin Udall delivering so many insults, homophobic, racist, anti-Semitic and misogynistic, as if he allowed himself to express his personal grudge against the whole world. But I guess the character ceases to be detestable only on the account that he's played by Jack Nicholson, we can easily suspect that he was written with 'Jack' in mind for only he can elevate a curmudgeon to such a level of reverse likability, maybe because the eyes betray a touch of vulnerability that try to cover his expressive eyebrows. Yet, although it's not too hazardous to assume that by the end of the film, the inner goodness of 'Uncle Scrooge' will finally blossom, when the movie starts with Udall throwing of the neighbor's dog Verdell in the trash chute, we're left with mixed feelings.Thankfully, the relative vileness of good old Udall is compensated by the presence of one of the sweetest female characters ever written for a romantic comedy. Helent Hunt plays a sort of everyday 'Dorothy Boyd'. I wonder by the way if Albert Brooks took some inspiration from 'Jerry Maguire' (I personally doubt it's a coincidence that Cuba Gooding Jr. stars as the neighbor's boyfriend) but it would be reduce Helen Hunt's role through a comparison, the movie glows out of her touching sensitivity. Provided she lives with her mother, her son suffers from a chronic asthma, so she doesn't have time to think for herself, her performance transcends the cinematic banality of her situation. She wonderfully plays the kind of women so constantly in a state of panic and anxiety that any relief could leave her with some emotional alter-effects. In a way, like Udall, she's also depending on habits that canceled off all her chances to find love, to even dream about it.The two characters are meant to be together, but I concede that's a feeling guided by movies standards. I doubt that a man like Udall would be with a woman the age of his daughter. Maybe an older woman would have fit the story, or a younger man, or maybe we shouldn't be too optimistic about what happens two weeks after the closing scene, but once the movie establishes the characters, and before they end up together, it's all about the human interactions, the ups-and-downs between two lonely hearts taken in a sentimental maze. Their relationship can almost be compared to these labyrinth games where you have to guess from which point to start to get to the end, only this time, you can't cheat by starting from the end, everything has to be done by the book and God, how hard it gets for these two, even by romantic comedies' standards.But if as a rom-com, 'As Good as it Gets' delivers the classic material, as a human comedy, it's a wonderful exploration of the way different people can influence each other for the better, how love and friendship can be planted by the seeds of generosity. I insist on the human comedy term, because general romantic comedies rely on two main characters with foils meant to separate or reunite them. 'As Good as it Gets' is enriched by the addition of the gay neighbor, an ill-fated artist painter who's beaten by one of his models' friends after a botched burglary. Greg Kinnear is Simon, a young man whose life totally falls apart and can only find hope through the help of the very guy who threw his Verdell in the trash chute. And Verdell plays a significant part too, would have he been shown in the poster otherwise?Verdell is the first intrusion in Udall's solitary life, but the cohabitations goes surprisingly well, Udall plays 'Always Look on the Bright Side of his Life' (a priceless joke by itself) and the dog eats the bacon, at the end, Udall and Verdell acclimated to each other and Simon realizes that if the dog liked him, maybe he's not such a bad guy. Basically, the whole film consists on Udall revealing more generous sides of his personalities, but ruining everything at the most crucial moment. When he hires a doctor to take care of Carol's son, without any costs for her, he not only saves the boy, but also changes Carol and her mother's life. He asks nothing in return, except when the opportunity comes, to accompany him, while he's driving Simon to his parents. We suspect the trip will be pivotal for the three characters, but it's all in the way it happens and how Simon acts as a perfect buffer between Carol and Udall.And the love-and-hate relationship reaches a beautiful paroxysm during a restaurant dinner, when Udall makes such a despicable remark; he's forced to counterbalance it by a nice word. Carol begs for a compliment not because she's desperate but because the moment is too romantic to be ruined, they have to act as normal persons for once. After a confused monologue, Udall finds the perfect wording with the unforgettable 'You make me want to be a better man', which is the 'You had me at 'hello'' of the film, but more meaningfully. Yet we're so used to his personality that we expect the word too many. The relationship seems doomed unless Carol stops being obsessive of having a better man, and does her best to look on the bright side on Udall.You know how good 'As Good as it Gets' is? It makes you realize how some romantic comedies were not as good as you thought. Naturally, at the end, the obligatory happy ending kind of belittle the whole originality reached by the film, yet the feeling is swept off by a total relief, to see finally these two tortured characters having a break, and enjoying a good time, we hope to be as long, or perhaps, as good it gets.",9,1,1,23 November 2012
Citizen Kane," Charles Foster Kane's dying words announcing the birth of Modern cinema ...
","In a vast and gloomy property, you're welcomed by a sign as cold as the cloudy night sky, 'NO TRESPASSING' dominated by a big 'K' atop the door gate. The atmosphere is like getting ready to mourn the life that is gasping its last breaths, and then in one of the many rooms that populate the manor, a mouth covered by a big brushy mustache whispers 'Rosebud' in a solemn echo. A life has gone, and a big snow globe falls to the ground and shatters in thousands of pieces. A man is dead, a masterpiece is born. 'Rosebud.' How can you define a life, a man or anything that carries so much contradictory and complex interpretations, in one word? The attempt to understand a figure as larger-than-life as Charles Foster Kane, the press magnate, through his dying word is not only the mystery that 'Citizen Kane' tries to solve, in a Utopian effort, but also the greatest cinematic secret ever created. I know this superlative has been overused ad nausea to describe Orson Welles' masterpiece to a point the movie that currently thrones over the American Film Institute's Top 100 became the epitome of cinematic greatness, but this is not without reasons.What strikes the most when you watch 'Citizen Kane' is the way the movie exudes a modernity that gets more palpable after each viewing. The film tries to understand the man that embodies the American Dream in its most appealing and appalling aspects. A man who, as a child, was torn away from his family to be precociously raised in manhood, until becoming the ruler of one of the most influent newspapers in America, as an idealist and social oriented figure first, before being alienated by his own egomania. Never has a character study, literally, challenged our intelligence in such a thrilling way. If the movie is not the first one to use non-linear narrative, it sure is the one that transcended the entertaining value of flashbacks.This is the first element that is remembered when we evoke 'Citizen Kane', the way the journalist, interestingly seen in shadows like making one with the audience, interviews some protagonists of Kane's life : the surrogate father, Mr. Thatcher, his banker, Kane's best friend, his ex-second wife and his butler, each one of them giving a particular insight on Kane's personality, sometimes idealistic, a bully, a mix of contradictions that maintains the enigma more than it solves it. The editing that swings between crucial parts of Kane's life using so many artistic cuts and masterful ellipses is the key element on 'Citizen Kane'' newness, but not the part of the technical achievement.The modernity on which relies the general appreciation of 'Citizen Kane' is so omnipresent that if I didn't want to take the movie's greatness for granted, I would say that Orson Welles tried every new trick he could, turning the film into some kind of arty experimentation. But this is a critic I used with another milestone film, Jean-Luc Godard's 'Breathless' where I thought the absence of a story distracted from the directorial accomplishment. For 'Citizen Kane', it works, the uses of deep focus is never gratuitous, like in this memorable shot where Mary Kane signs the papers while you can see, young Charlie Kane sledding in the snow, foreshadowing, the end of his innocent days. The delightfully elliptic editing showing the downfall of Kane's marriage, as he and his wife get more and more distant, the use of shadows, close-ups, and this never-ending feeling of irony, like this moment where the camera dramatically rises over the opera's curtain to show two workmen express their appreciation of Susan's singing talent, the extraordinary make-up transcended by the acting talent of Orson Welles, and even Joseph Cotton to play other characters, the innovation technique in 'Citizen Kane' could be a subject for a long thesis. Let's just say that it paved the way for modern cinema like 'The Birth of a Nation' did during the silent era. Now, is this the only reason that can explain why 'the movie is so great, is such a big deal'? I think the story contributed to more than 50%. 'Citizen Kane' is about understanding a man whose ambition exceeded the limits of his functions. He didn't want to inform, but to be loved, to rule America with his own visions, to be the one who'll say to people what and how to think, prophesying the current media totalitarian monopoly even in democracies. And this is only one element of a vast psychological jigsaw puzzle whose central piece is still 'Rosebud'. There's no particular strategy when you solve a jigsaw puzzle, but the journalist follows the most usual one, assembling the common elements, and then joining them together.Why such a need for love? Maybe the loss of his mother is the Oedipian driver that inspired him to get more in touch in people? Maybe his failure in politics transferred his blind ambition on Susan, the second wife? Or maybe money and power, corrupt the purest souls, and the more powerful, and richer you get, the more detestable becomes the idea of being criticized. In the last appearance of Charles Foster Kane with many reflect mirrors the multidimensionality of a man who still intrigues and fascinates now. And in one of the all-time greatest performances, Welles embodies Kane as the precocious genius who's to cinema what Kane tried to be for America.The movie wasn't successful, but time did it justice, 'Citizen Kane's is now part of American Culture like Mark Twain or Jazz music, and one of the most iconic films ever with these scenes forever graved in our memories, 'Rosebud', the 'New on the March' reel, the dance scene, Xanadou, 'I'm Charles Foster Kane!', and of course that immortal ending that gives the clue about the one true thing that was 'Rosebud', as the most valuable and irreplaceable part of any man's life ..",10,1,2,16 July 2011
Darkest Hour," Approved by the Academy...
","The year is 1940, war is raging all over Europe. Poland is occupied, Holland and Belgium surrendered and France is undergoing the Nazi rollercoaster. All democracies are defeated.... All of them? No, an isle commanded by a stubborn Prime Minster won't stop to put up resistance. Yes, I'm an Asterix fan, in case you haven't noticed... and not much a fan of Joe Wright's 'Darkest Hour', a movie whose very merit draws an interesting parallel with Churchill himself, a man whose heroism could only be unveiled by a dramatic opportunity, a matter of timing. Churchill was overdue a biopic and Gary Oldman an Oscar, and that's that.There's nothing more satisfying than a movie tailor-made to win Oscars and that fail... it's fun to see them stumble and fall and remind a few producers that having movies based on true stories, involving a real-life larger-than-it figure, slightly more eccentric than the average schmuck, with actors who've proved to be bankable, isn't a guarantee for gold. In the same vein, there's nothing more frustrating than seeing the Academy biting the bait. By no means, am I implying that 'The Darkest Hour' is a bad film, but is it anything new after 'The King's Speech' or 'Lincoln'. Again, we have a historical figure facing a moral dilemma in the midst of a war on which the future of a country hinges, countless discussions between Chamberlain (Ronald Pickup) and Hallifax (Stephen Dilane) to decide if one should discuss peace and two patriotic and rousing speeches that seal the country's fate. On the paper, it's terrific but on the screen, it doesn't demand more than what a simple play could have provided.Indeed, having Gary Oldman, the actor who made a specialty out of playing original and/or slightly disturbed characters, play the most iconic British figure was an offer fans and movie lovers couldn't refuse but how on Earth did the film, good but never great, garner six nominations including Best Picture. The film isn't a war movie but a huis-clos centering on the month of May 1940 where Europe surrendered to the Blitzkrieg and the British isle became the next target. The conflict is simple: should Britain listen to the terms of Hitler or fight... we all know surrendering won't be an option (so much for the suspense) but the thrills rely on the way Churchill is never totally approved even after his nomination at the head of the country, it's as if he was embodying the country's own insulation. In a way, it's a good premise for a film but I suspect its existence was to be more of a vehicle for Oldman than any attempt to inspire a new interest on the British Bulldog.If you're going to have a movie about Churchill, why not go straight ahead with it, and call it the 'Darkest Hours', why making it on the cheap and not have anything about the Blitz attacks and the magnificent way the Royal Air Force counterattacked... the film only exists to show the way Churchill win the battle of opinions, while real battles are either won and lost, having glimpses of hesitation at times and be the histrionic chap we expect. On that level, Oldman never disappoints but don't count on me to consider his performance deserving, here's why: Churchill is a living icon, he's hot-heated, hot-tempered, gross and vulgar in a sophisticated way, all you've got to do is chomp on your cigar and chew the scenery anyone would get away with it. A character like Churchill provides so many constraints that it's easier for an actor to depend on them and then let the inspiration take a life of its own. That's why I believe it's easier to play characters like Stephen Hawkins than the role that earned Casey Affleck his much deserved Oscar the year before.Speaking of Hawkins, I called 'The Theory of Everything' one of the most Oscar-baity films I've seen and 'The Darkest Hour' reminded me of it, I didn't expect there would be a connection. Screenwriter Anthony MCarten seems to adore crowd-pleasing tear-jerking Oscar darlings, he's not a bad writer but I'm afraid he's diluting his talents in heavy-handed projects that might sometimes end with failed melodramas and he won't make quite a name for himself following that trend, though he did better with 'Bohemian Rhapsody', a film with a greater scope than Wright's war drama. Now, I didn't want to enter that turf about bait or not bait but when I got to the tube scene, I couldn't help but feel that the film was trying too hard, much to hard to pay tribute to a certain vision of London that would appeal to a 2010's audience and give Churchill a sort of sacred halo Ã  la Gandhi (a man he despised by the way) watching that scene, I thought the real Churchill would roll over his grave.There were enough good biopics lately and it's unfair to make critics on the basis of comparisons but I wish we could have more movies like 'Patton' or 'Lawrence of Arabia' making biopic rhyming with epic, and not limiting itself to a timeline where FDR is inexistent and De Gaulle not a name yet, there's a lot of talk in 'The Darkest Hour', I just wished the film could walk the walk. Rumor has it they're planning a sequel, maybe it's a recognition of how limited for such a grand figure the original was.",7,0,0,25 July 2019
The Birth of a Nation," The Birth of Filmmaking ...
","There are two truths regarding D.W. Griffith's 'Birth of a Nation': it IS a cinematic landmark AND a disturbingly racist -much more- racialist film. If technical greatness doesn't redeem from the controversial content, blatant racism can't cancel out the revolutionary achievement either.I read my recent review of Hitchcock's 'Lifeboat' where I conceded that if anyone could make a masterpiece of propaganda, there couldn't be an 'objective' masterpiece happening to be propaganda, for instinct of superiority is morally low and easily aroused. The fact that it doesn't take much efforts for a director to win the hearts of a specific audience, contradicts the universal and timeless appeal of Art, that can only be reached by attempts to reach truth, beauty and justice.Let's face it, 'The Birth of a Nation' while not totally inaccurate, encapsulates the most abject aspects of the Old South's mythology, reviving a myth that can no longer appeal to any decent audiences from any part of the world. Not every piece of Art should carry grand values, we can have art for the sake of art, but 'The Birth of a Nation' can't get away with that excuse for the film was made with a clear and explicit purpose: it was meant as a historical film, chronicling, only 50 years after, the Secession War. The Civil War was recent enough to leave some unconcealed wounds in the heart of many Southerners. And the fact that the film pretends to be humanistic by vilifying the War shows an unspoken parallel between the Union and Confederate Armies' brotherly bonding at the end and the same waste that painted in bloody red the mud on the European trenches. But the 'treacherous' reason of such hellish depiction relies on the emphasis made on the 'Liberty and Union, now and forever' as the film's motto, to convey an uglier message: the Black is the enemy. However, there's no doubt that if not the message, the technical achievements stood the test of time. The War sequence is made of magnificent crosscutting between panoramic shots and individual fights, and the action is cleverly punctuated with brief sequences involving the protagonist's families. The film, unlike 'Gone With the Wind', operates in several fronts: the South where the Camerons live, the North where the Stonemans lives (Stoneman is a fictionalization of Thaddeus Stevens) the battlefield, and Washington, Lincoln's headquarters. And through Griffith' bravura directing, we follow the lives of these protagonists during three separate acts. The pre-War period features a bucolic postcard-like South, where men with chivalrous looks court young and playful ladies. Then the War sweeps off everything and concludes with Lincoln's assassination, recreated with such historical accuracy it felt like real footage. Then, the reconstruction part forever soiled the film with the black paint on white actors told to act like 'savage beasts'. Although it's impossible to close the eyes on such aberrations, we shouldn't overlook the film's age: its context is as historical as the Civil War and ethical standards don't excuse chronological leaps when it comes to criticism: the film is an inevitable masterpiece.In fact, it's as a great film as America is a great nation, whose greatness was built on the ashes of such crimes as the Natives' genocide and slavery. These are stains on America's heart and it's befitting that the seminal film of the country of filmmaking would carry the same racism that forged the nation. Especially since the film works like a mirror of an era when things were different: some people were racist, other were not, some others believed they were only honoring the heritage of the South and were truly believing that peace depended on a separation between Whites and Blacks, hence the fact that the good 'blacks' were named 'faithful souls'.Again, this patronizing attitude doesn't excuse the black faces, but they contrast so much with the historical perfectionism of the War sequence that they speak more negative statements against Griffith's genuine naivety than the Black community. So, if the film doesn't speak the truth, it says its own truth about the standards of the Day and the way History of America was still misread, when people needed a scapegoat to justify the ruin of Civilization (today, there can still be a 'Birth of Nation' with Arabs as the evil-doers). As for the other purposes of Art: beauty and Justice, within their own debatable subjectivity, they do complete each other for the sake of entertainment.To make myself clearer: we all resent the Ku Klux Klan ideals, and we don't believe that Blacks were the one-dimensional evil renegades or carpetbaggers who plotted a vengeful destruction of the South, but the film efficiently created two sides: the good guys and the villains, and at the end, through an operatic apotheosis, the 'good' guys triumph and 'Justice' is restored. Within the films' intellectual limitations, we're absorbed by the romanticism of the action and the iconic culmination with the climactic Ride of the Clansmen under the Valkyries' music, the film's most iconic moment.The clansmen go rescue the Cameron's family trapped in a Union veteran's cabin. The inter-cutting between the different protagonists, the music, the fast-paced montage and the final confrontation, are so perfectly handled that we watch the film for what it is: a heart-pounding epic. And if I said that there couldn't be a masterpiece of a propaganda, maybe it's because it wasn't intended as propaganda, explaining why Griffith, baffled by the racist allegations would make one year later 'Intolerance'.Still, I believe 'The Birth of a Nation' should have been kept on AFI's Top 100 Movies and not be replaced by 'Intolerance' for politically correct reasons. The film, despite its content is one of the most important movies ever made; its impact on directing, editing and storytelling is invaluable. Without 'The Birth of Nation', there would be no movies, not even those to contradict its message.",8,1,2,7 August 2013
Memento," 'Chris N. will trick your mind' ... a review a la 'Memento' ...
","'Memento' is not your typical whodunit film, it's more a howcatchem, where we don't know who to catch, except maybe the first victim, Joe Pantaliano, a friendly mustached man, accused of being the author of a horrific rape and murder. He doesn't even have time to defend himself, Lenny, played by Guy Pearce, kills him ruthlessly, until we see the stains of bloods and drops going in reverse, and understand the direction the film will take, for our delighted surprise.'Remember Sammy Jenkins': Lenny's motto, the only thing he conditioned himself to remember. It's the story of a man suffering from his same short-term memory, until it ultimately killed his wife. This probably is the element that justified the use of the backwards narration because it shows the deadly nature of Lenny's memory problem, Lenny who just killed a man thought to be his wife's murderer. Two parallel stories, one bloody murder, one revenge story, a short-term memory, a story in reverse, a claustrophobic setting, there's something quite uneasy in this cinematic journey. And the dizziness is the same as when you sit in the opposite seats of the train's direction, but you will arrive at destination. And that the identity of the murderer will be revealed, or no, that the revelation will be shocking. Because Memento is not your typical whodunit film  Basically, the reverse thing's point is to teach us, not to believe in the appearances. Lenny's condition needs proofs, things written, everywhere, tattooed in his body, pictures with names on it, and devices written as to warn himself from the danger of being teased. The guy killed in the beginning, named Teddy, surprisingly seems to be Lenny buddy and helper, but he's tagged as suspicious in his photography. Every hint has to be material, but the more we get in Lenny's conditions, the more we realize that these precautions act like a double-edged sword. So the movie basically, prepares us to a biggest surprise about the identity of the murderer, who's probably not that Teddy. How could we be so sure? Simply, because the movie is a mystery, and the resolution can only come at the end. Besides, such a powerful film can't afford an ordinary ending. And this is where the 'Sammy Jenkins' situation interferes with our understanding of the film. 'Remember Sammy Jenkins': Lenny's motto, the only thing he conditioned himself to remember  Among the great memorable scenes, there's one where you wonder why Lenny's being mocked by a drunkard while tasting a beer given by the waitress that would help him in his investigation, until the previous scene that happened before in the story, you see that she spitted on it, to test him. Then, she was convinced, and so were we. That was a comic relief scene, but how about the one where she comes with her face beaten, asking for his help, until we realize in the previous-next scene that he was the one teased to hit her in the face. But the palm of the funniest (yes, I know it's a drama, but this one was priceless) is the priceless 'I'm chasing this gun?' 'No, he's chasing me'. These ten seconds are enough justifications to the backwards narration. And since the movie starts with the killing, basically, the reverse thing's point is to teach us, not to believe in the appearances  Lenny's short-term memory problem: the kind of plot device that could taste like caviar when handled by a good screenwriter and like tomato juice by another. Basically, if he just finished reading this part of the review, he can't remember how it started; imagine how painful it would be. I don't know, if this handicap convinced Chris Nolan to make the story backwards of it's the idea of making a story backwards that reminded him of memory problems, but it would be like discussing of what was first: the egg or the chicken  The idea was perfect, and the way, we follow Lenny in his backwards quest to find the murdered of his wife is a gold mine for memorable situations. Among the great memorable scenes, there's one where you wonder why Lenny's being mocked by a drunkard while tasting a beer given by the waitress  Simply, a brilliant story. Did you notice I used a specific word: story? There is the script, and the story, too. The story had to justify this architecture. By the way, I'm using the word architecture for the second time, because I know Nolan is like an architect of screen writing, using plot devices as so many bricks to build unforgettable movies, I didn't think it worked that well for 'Inception' because it lacked something called 'heart', it works with 'Memento' because the story has one, and its heart pumped by a true desire of revenge. Lenny, played by a superb Guy Pearce, has one quest, finding John G., the one who raped and murdered his wife. His motives are understandable, and the story would have been a normal linear chase if it wasn't for one handicap: Lenny's short-term memory problem, the kind of plot device that could taste like caviar when handled by a good screenwriter  'Memento' is a cinematic experience that tricks your mind from beginning to end, or should I say, from the ending to the beginning, or wait a minute, again, I'm lost  Now, where was I? Oh yeah, you know that they say about a good script? It must have a beginning, middle, and an ending  but not necessarily in that order. I guess 'Memento' respects the idea of what makes a good story, but the genius of the script, and the brilliance of its creativity rely on the incredible architecture that started the film at the end, to go on backwards, until an unforgettable climactic conclusion, that occurred at the beginning of the story. Simply, a brilliant story",10,1,2,3 May 2011
Inglourious Basterds," A dangerous and irresponsible film from a director who used to be great...
","Reviewing 'Inglourious Basterds' is a moral dilemma. I know it has everything to please the fans, it's entertaining, masterfully directed and edited, and features memorable characters portrayed by a big-star cast, and the whole film is carried by one of the greatest supporting and villainous performance of the last ten years. Christoph Waltz, as Hans Landa, is an unforgettable character, magnetic even in one blink or a crazy smirk. But this is a supporting performance, not enough to redeem the film.'Inglourious Basterds' is the living proof that Tarantino lost his touch. The 'Kill Bill' series is a masterpiece of movie homage, something that worked because you could feel that Tarantino made this film with his heart, he grew up with Asian Kung-Fu films, and made a masterpiece out of it. But now, why does he feel the need to rely all his movies on that concept? After the drive-in B-movies in 'Death Proof' which beyond the action, was just an exercise of testosterone stimulation, and a tentative to resurrect Kurt Russel's character as he did for Travolta, I started thinking Tarantino was slipping. But I didn't take the movie that seriously and I thought even Tarantino is allowed to loosen up a bit, and please the fans of the genre, with a fun to watch and well-crafted action flick.But now, we have a film nominated in the Cannes' festival, in many glorious competitions, including the Oscars. It's something presented as a new 'Pulp Fiction', so the movie takes itself so seriously before its release, it deserves a serious and honest critic  and all I can say is that I will probably never get the love for 'Inglourious Basterds', a film where Tarantino caricatures himself, disguising barbarity and cruelty under the fallacious legitimacy of fighting the quintessential evil enemy, the Nazis. Done intelligently, it could have been an interesting film, but in this world where violence is preached by fanatics and fantasized by lunatics, this is (despite Waltz and his hilarious Italian scene) an irresponsible film whose plot twist made it even more dangerous, as it conveyed the dangerous message that this was the way it should have been done, therefore, this is the way WE should treat our enemies.And if violence, even in the cruelest and barbaric form is legitimated when you fight evil, you've got to question yourself about the meaning of that word. Is it right to carve a swastika in a soldier's forehead to condemn him for perpetual shame when he was just doing his duty. Were we supposed to cheer during the scalping? Or the scene where an officer's head was reduced to a pulp with a baseball bat? Were we supposed to cheer when Diane Kruger's character shot the guy she had just guaranteed his safety, or the soldier who was mercilessly shot at the end and then inevitably scalped? These scenes made me nauseous and hating the movie because it just encouraged the most odious and dangerous racist fantasies, in such a patronizing way, I wonder how come no fan felt insulted.This is a dangerous film, definitely glorifying violence by making it cool, bad-ass, and legitimate just because there's something 'naturally' evil in the enemy, and it's not just violence, it's the graphicness, the cold-blooded horrific way of killing, and the fact that it's supposed to make people clap and enjoy the gruesomeness ... this is an irresponsible case of glorifying violence, and the script's biggest flaw. I guess the Shoshanna's subplot was a way to inject the eternal revenge story, supposedly the heart of the film. But for some reason, the actress didn't touch me, she was playing it too cool and aggressive, and the part that definitely killed the character was the glamorous sequence that looked more like an advertisement for cosmetics than anything else. Shosanna who witnessed the killing of her family, behaves like some kind of sexy James Bond girl. Probably not bad acting, but a too coldly artificial writing to be believable.(And if a great performance can't redeem a film I guess, a bad one can also ruin it... like the guy who played the projectionist, Marcel, his delivery of lines was so laughable I wonder if Tarantino was really behind the camera when it was shot)Now, I know the fans will over-analyze the film talking about its self-referential aspect, our approach to violence, a great homage to classic war films and I must concede that when I watched the opening scene, I thought it would be a masterpiece, but this 'homage' thing must stop now, it's okay for one or two scenes, but basing the whole movie structure on that has been a little bit overused by Tarantino ... it's time now to come with something more original, and less irresponsible.I say 'irresponsible' because Tarantino became like a cinematic label, as if any of his movies would automatically please the fans, I don't mean this as an insult, Tarantino was my favorite director five years ago, I've always thought the guy defined 'coolness' in films, he was for me the-coolest-director-in-the-world and whatever he made, said and touched, was cool and entertaining. That's why I think this movie is irresponsible, because Tarantino uses his undeniable talent and creativity to communicate an extremely dangerous message, and many of his younger fans will think it's cool and bad-ass to scalp the evil enemy, because Tarantino said so, and Brad Pitt did it.To conclude, 'That's NOT a bingo!' and the popularity of this film is revealing of a very sad reality where movies like 'Saving Private Ryan' are considered as one of the greatest war films ever, and 'Inglourious Basterds' praised as a masterpiece, even by Tarantino, in his pretentious closing lines  a movie I expected to like, and I ended up hating it with intensity.",4,12,19,11 March 2011
Kickboxer," The 'Rocky' (IV) of Thaï Boxing...
","Last night, I wanted to watch Laurence Olivier's 'Hamlet', the DVD didn't work. I tried the original version of 'The Ballad of Narayama', the DVD bugged as well. Then I put the original 'A Star is Born' but the streaks of malfunction didn't want to end.Then I said to myself 'oh what the heck, let's just watch 'Kickboxer' on Netflix!' Which feels like cancelling a reservation to the town's fanciest French restaurant for a kebab. But if the film doesn't exactly offer the same menu than the other distinguished titles, it's perhaps the most likely to be visited again and again. I don't mean that it's so bad it's good, but one should revaluate the taste of these old martials arts movies, getting better with time. Now that 'Kickboxer' has celebrated its thirtieth anniversary, it's interesting to note how well it holds up or let's just say, better than expected.Enumerating the flaws would be a vain exercise but let's do it for fun. Sure the acting and the writing isn't exactly the film's driving force, sure the brother's body language is as convincing as a mayonnaise tube. Sure the Winston character seems to belong to some 'Rambo' or 'Commando' wannabe. Sure the revenge story is as predictable as a Disney film. Sure the character of Tong Po who starts as a legitimate opponent gets a useless villain-upgrade as if we needed more reasons to hate him than breaking the bro's vertebras. Sure the film is as implausible as it's corny, but the real question is: to what extent does that make it unwatchable?When it comes to movies that 'bad' on objective terms, I tend to remember Ebert's critic of a really bad movie of the same year: 'She's Out of Control'. Following his inquisitive critic, I watched the film again and realized it wasn't as bad as it was wrong on many levels, especially the creepily incestuous implications. 'Kickboxer' keeps a rather clean image behind its simple concept of a brother avenging his brother after he's been left paralysed. I'm not saying any film can get away with positive feelings and morality, but in the case of 'Kickboxer', the plot has so little subtlety that one can concede that much to the film, it's got heart, and a good heart.
There's more to appreciate, like the passion and respectful dedication to martial arts and in that case Muay Thai. Once the story takes off and the basic training begins, we're immersed in a territory that wouldn't feel unfamiliar to 'Karate Kid' fans, after all, Xiao is a likable character but not far from the sensei with unorthodox method training codified by Mr. Miyagi. Still, Van Damme designed the story in a way that showed respect to the discipline and discipline in general and prompted many young viewers to adopt martial arts as a passion of theirs.Inded, whenever I consider Van Damme movies, I remember my older cousin and his poster-clad bedroom, he was Van Damme's number one fan, practised Karate competition, and always brought us the latest Van Damme VHS, needless to say we used to watch in crappy 80s quality. And that's part of the charm; one that gives a slight gourmet taste to these films, the sound was awful, the cropping hideous so we were looking to beauty whenever it could pop up. Anyone must remember these old-school textures that DVDs and Netflix swept off, the film looks so empty and bland now that it makes you easily forget the kind of experience VHS provided. You had to stay focused, to get through the film, it filled your afternoon and your heart before you'd get back to reality, 'Kickboxer' provided so much fun that even its laughable flaws were forgettable.And yet for all these flaws, there were a few scenes that stuck in memory, 'Tong-Po hitting the pillar concrete, the palm tree breaking, the trick to run faster, the training in the Buddhist temple and one of Van Damme's infamous drunk-dancing moment, one of the highlights of his fluctuating career with so many ups and downs and double kicks, Van Damme had the moves and not just for the splits.Finally, it's a martial arts movie so one that must be judged on the basis of its climactic fight, once again the choreographic staging shows some relative professionalism. It doesn't stand out like the 'Bloodsport' Kumite but it's still the second best Van Damme movie, one that makes you want to chant 'Nuk Soo Cow' all over the place, before some random uplifting 80s theme start.'Kickboxer' is the reflection of simpler times when combat movies didn't rely on sophisticated stories but just stars with enough appeal to drag an audience. Sure it's not a masterpiece, but it'll please the right amount of fans whether of Van Damme or martial arts, it's probably the 'Rocky' of the Thai Boxing.... Or le's just say the 'Rocky IV'.",7,0,1,26 March 2019
Coraline," A 'Wizard of Oz'-like tale, tailor-made for the 2000s...
","Adapted from Neil Gaiman's book of the same name, Henry Selick's 'Coraline' isn't a movie I would let my 6-year old daughter watch but it's only a matter of a few years as the film is certainly relevant for an audience over the age of 10. It is also entertaining, spectacular and dark and disturbing, a little less than 'Pan's Labyrinth' but a little more than 'Pinocchio'.This is a story about a pre-teen girl who feels (more than she is) neglected by her parents; not because they belong to the abusive sort but because they're all intensely absorbed by their personal project of making a garden catalogue and all their petty adult preoccupations regarding their new life in 'Rose Palace', Oregon. The moral comfort of their daughter isn't the least of their concerns but surely any child would love to live near a forest with colorful and eccentric European artists as neighbors and in a house looking like the setting of a Scooby-Doo episode.But Coraline isn't like any child... the titular heroine isn't a model of extraversion, nor is she your typical shy, insecure little girl who needs the presence of an imaginary friend to feel valuable or to make up for the lack of parental love. Coraline doesn't try to be pleasant, she's a self-centered, strong-willed girl who doesn't care about befriending the well-meaning house owner's grandson 'Wybie' just because he's the only child around. In all this unpleasantness, it comes down to her most infantile trait being the most universal one: curiosity. Coraline is intrigued and fascinated by mysterious traps and doors, including one that opens on a bricked wall.It is a well-known trope of many fantasy stories, the portal that leads to a different world materializing as a tornado in 'The Wizard of Oz', a rabbit hole in 'Alice in Wonderland' or a wardrobe in 'Chronicles of Narnia'... like Alice, Dorothy or Wendy Darling, there's a predisposition in Coraline to envision a better world lying somewhere. And so we understand the stylistic choices of the opening sequence, all in depressing colors and autumnal mood to better highlight the contrast with the other world, like the sepia used for the Kansas part in 'Oz'. The film is told from Coraline's perspective and it's interesting how the atmosphere reflects her mood in a binary way, she enjoys the color and reject the boring grey, like a normal child would do.The film has another similarity with 'Oz', which is the presence of doubles for each character except for Coraline and a mysterious cat. It starts with an opening sequence involving the meticulous fabrication of a doll with hands that evoke needles and puncture. The making of a doll starts with the symbolic death of the first one emptied from her content, as if there was no possible form of life and pleasure without a necessary sacrifice to make. And with Bruno Coulais' haunting music, we suspect some creepy undertones behind the pleasantness of the doll that looks like Coraline.And so many questions come to mind: does the hand belong to an omnipotent God-like figure? a villain? is the doll a friend? whatever purpose this opening sequence carries takes its full meaning once we know who possesses these needle-like hands. Of course, some would make the immediate connection with Tim Burton's 'Edward Scissorhands' and the film came from the director of 'Nightmare Before Christmas' whose idea originated from Burton. Henry Selick remains the unsung hero of an oeuvre that has so many Burton vibes his name was only known by movie lovers. But let's get back to 'Coraline'.I guess there are two dimensions of appreciation : first it's a movie about a dream any child could have, better parents, living in a beautiful world full of fun and amusement. And the film follows the plotline of many tales like Pinocchio when children discover at their own expenses that for every dream, there's a price to pay. Discovering the other world through the portal, Coraline sees better versions of her parents, gentler, funnier, more dedicated to her wishes. The catch is that they are all doll-like figures with buttons instead of eyes, what starts as a cute little gimmick turns into a creepy and lifeless vision of 'forced' beatitude.So we get the other side of the coin, and the real coming-to-age aspect of the story is when the heroine understands that she better accepts her own people with their flaws than the so-called idealized vision, it's the usual 'there's no place like home' with a subtitle for 2000's audience: 'beware what you wish for.Coming of age is the reason why this movie works more for children, just watch the different travels Coraline makes: first she bumps into the ideal world where she sees better versions of her parents and her neighbors, it's accidental. Then it's deliberate, she wants to have fun and has the time of her life admiring the circus, the ballet and musical numbers that remind of Disney extravaganza. After that; she understands the price she has to pay for the ideal world, which means abandoning a precious capability : to see things for real... later, she has to get back to save her parents. In four travels Coraline grows up and learns more about life and herself and becomes altruistic and mature.This a wonderful evolution of character in the same vein than 'Pan's Labyrinth' and all the classic tales I mentioned, one that teaches kids about the limits of imagination and idealization and where dolls are both attractive and creepy. Horror, fantasy, and fairy tale magnificently blend in Selick's film, a wonder of animation that proves how stop motion is such an underrated genre of animation, the same year than 'Mary and Max', another movie about a child looking for a meaning to her daily life... until finding a meaning to life itself.",8,2,2,25 December 2019
Shakespeare in Love," Romance and Genius...
","'Shakespeare in Love' should have been cinema's ultimate homage to William Shakespeare, not through an umpteenth adaptation, or adaptation's adaptation, to one of his iconic plays, but by putting the iconic playwright within the framework of an original movie plot; original in the sense that it turns him into the subject of a real-life yet loosely fictionalized biopic, a romantic comedy and something of an educational film. We learn a lot throughout John Madden's film, about stage, art, business, royalty and naturally, the genius of Shakespeare, the man who was put in the top 10 of the most influential people of the last millennium, the most highly ranking artist, above Mozart and the Beatles.I hate to use the word 'multi-layered' because it makes a movie sound like architectural work instead of than something being guided by genuine inspiration, but hey, if anything Madden's film proves is that even the greatest masterpieces were not made by a snap of a finger and were build upon many other factors than inspiration. Like 'Romeo and Juliet', 'Shakespeare in Love' is a multi-layered accomplishment, a work of art that can be enjoyed on many levels, confidently overlapping, but always with romance at the core. If the film's story isn't likely to leap over the centuries like 'Romeo and Juliet', it doesn't matter; Will and Viola aren't supposed to steal Romeo and Juliet's thunder but to incarnate the seminal inspiration to the iconic couple. That's their power.Sadly, for all the reasons that can make 'Shakespeare in Love', a great journey into love, passion and an immersion in the world and business of theater at the dawn of Queen Elizabeth's reign, the film is remembered as one of the worst Best Picture winners, the one that dared to steal 'Saving Private Ryan's golden statuette at the 1999 Oscars. Spielberg's war movie was an instant classic, a film that immediately topped all the 'Great Films' list, and to many users and even official websites, it is now an objective truth that 'Shakespeare in Love' didn't deserve the Oscar. And instead of being a love story about a love story, the film had become a trigger to an enduring hate story with the Internet users. Hated and even loved for the wrong reasons, some would love it just because they hated 'Saving Private Ryan' with passion, which doesn't say much about both films anyway. Now, where do I stand? For me, 'Shakespeare in Love' isn't just one of these conventional costume dramas with sword fights, antechambers' plotting and feather-writing, and this comes from someone who loved the Best Picture co-nominee 'Elizabeth'. The film carries a sort of self-referential wit, as if it was conscious on its own craziness, it starts with the working title of the classic pay 'Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter', it's funny but it feels real. I mean, did you know that Walt Disney intended to call Mickey, Mortimer Mouse? The process of the creation of the play and how it is shaped by the real life events in the film is the kind of delights I love to see in a film, true or not. The part where Ben Affleck's character suggests Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) to keep the title 'Romeo and Juliet' had the same resonance than that moment in 'The Social Network' when Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake) tells Zuckerberg (Jess Eisenberg) to remove the 'The' from 'The Facebook' or when Zuckerberg says no one can't wear a sign indicating if he's single or engaged, hence coming with one of his most ingenuous ideas.That's the ransom of success and worldwide popularity, you can find countless inspirations for Romeo and Juliet's key scenes and I love how the two stories drive each other until the ultimate culmination. I also love how it still manages to encapsulate the conventions of its time like the forced marriage with Lord Wessex (Colin Firth), some thrilling duels, a few balcony meetings, nurses, antechambers plotting, and even the cross-dressing that prevailed in the theater at the time, and that earned Gwyneth Paltrow her Oscar. Indeed, women couldn't play in a stage, which makes you realize why comedy was the strongest suit to embody the notion of love. And the film even manages to showcase some daring anachronisms, one of my favorite being the 'psychiatrist' played by Anthony Sher. In this fascinating mess, you can't tell fiction from reality and you don't really care, for the film is fun from one bit of another, and is populated by a great gallery of British actors.Now, the real issue, is 'Did it deserve the Best Picture?' well, even if I didn't give it the Oscar, 'Saving Private Ryan' wouldn't be my second vote, the irony of 1998 is that it featured two costume dramas and two war movies, 'Life is Beautiful' has at least the merit to tackle a very thought-provoking idea and make an enchanting fable out of tragedy. Spielberg's film works on one level, which is the terrific realism of the war battles, but that's all, if you get deeper in the plot, you can easily spot some moments where it sinks into manipulative schmaltz, where you realize that this war is between good and evil guys, while it's true that there was an evil ideology ruling the side, you can't make a war movie and imply that every soldier deserved to die, this is too dangerously simplistic. So to all those who believe 'Saving Private Ryan' was the better one, I want to say why? The answers will all focus on the battles, story-wise or acting-wise, the other movies didn't deserve less.'Shakespeare in Love' had the merit to venture in many ideas, many genres, and be enjoyable on many levels. It didn't expect to compete against Spielberg's film, it might have benefited from Weinstein's lobbying, but to hate it on this sole basis isn't the stuff being passion for movies is made on, or constructive criticism.",8,1,1,22 November 2016
12 Monkeys," What could have been a bizarre neo-'Brazil' mess of a plot turns out to be a spellbinding and intelligent Sci-fi thriller, maybe Gilliam's masterpiece...
","'Twelve Monkeys' is a Terry Gilliam movie, so you know you'll feel lucky if you gather half of the plot at the end of the film. It is also a film whose story-line relies on time travels, swinging back and forth between the 90s urban hell and a dystopian future where humanity has been almost wiped from the surface of the Earth. The cinematography is so bleak and gritty that the future and the present (the past too) are like blue and red M&M's. But ever since 'Brazil', we know Gilliam has an inclination toward urban nightmares and dehumanizing technology.'Twelve Monkeys' also centers on a protagonist named James Cole, played by Bruce Willis, a man who is so tormented that he can't even tell if he's really living his own reality. And in this exhausting ride, he meets a young fanatic poor man's prophet, played by Brad Pitt, and in his disjointed mambo jumbo, tries to grab some bits of truths that can help him to find shadows of truth in this existential mess. So, basically, we have a movie made by the most anarchic and extravagant movie director (and he's quite polarizing on that level), playing on different time-lines and operating a real ping pong game of a narrative, and with psychological confusion to spice up an already complex plot. Yet, despite all these elements, this is perhaps the closest to a coherent and consistent plot I ever encountered in a Gilliam film. This is the film that could have been a bizarre nonsense, but it works, and the reason is quite simple: the film had a story, and much more, a compelling one.I'm not trying to make a lecture about screen writing, but for all its complexity, the film makes no secret about the set-up and the primal mission: humanity has been wiped out by a mysterious plague (five billions is quite a death toll) and people have been forced to live under the ground while animals have taken over the Earth. And as a way to emphasize the cataclysmic aspect of humanity's future, even time travels won't prevent the plague from happening, this is no 'Back to the Future', the film is set in a frozen time-line and what Cole can only do is bring samples or information about the original form of the virus so the scientists who sent him can study it in his present.This is crucial because the film cleverly toys with its own premise: things are meant to happen and all humans can do is minimize the consequences. But there's a feeling of impending doom governing the script and while we try to believe in the 'happy ending', we know that whatever Cole will try to do, he'll only lead himself to what is meant to happen. The movie mentions the Cassandra's syndrome inherent to people who knows about the tragedy bound to happen but can't do anything to prevent it because no one would listen, this is Cole's tragedy, something in the same vein than Oedipus. There's a flashback memory scene repeating itself as some muddy leitmotif, it involves a young kid witnessing a murder in an airport, a blonde woman and man with a ponytail. Although we suspect what is going on, the climax doesn't lose any of its impact.We're prepared to the finale, there's even a scene where the film 'Vertigo' is screened on the theater and Cole knows this is his story in a nutshell, some dreamy vision and obsession with a girl, and a story that will keep repeating itself. That's the core of 'Twelve Monkeys', it's a nightmarish time loop where a man is entrapped and where, during this short entrapment, he'll escape from his condition with a scientist played by Madeleine Stowe. And you've got to love the irony: just when he feels he might be wrong about himself, she's the one believing him. This is the soul of the film, a relationship between a man who couldn't even believe himself, and a woman who could but not to the point that she was able to stop the inevitable.This is a formidable twist on the eternal obsession of Sci-fi geeks and their 'what if' scenarios, you know: what if someone could go back in the past and kill Hitler or prevent September 11 from happening. 'Twelve Monkeys', although relying on an improbable premise, perhaps features the most realistic take on time travels.This is a jigsaw puzzle as a plot with great acting, including Brad Pitt's Oscar-nominated performance that launched his career, proving that he wasn't just some Tom Cruise wannabe, and it all takes a second viewing to reassemble all the pieces and even get some hints of subtle brilliance. This is a real triumph from Gilliam who, for once, didn't indulge to some of his annoying trademarks and didn't punctuate the film with some crazy fights, and for a movie that deals with madness and a hero who suspects some things are made out of his mind, any spectacular intrusion of a dragon or a samurai wouldn't have surprised me.But the British director restrained himself; he knew he got one hell of a story at hands, so there was no need to wrap it up in another extravagant fantasy. This lucidity made the film, as it is basically 'Brazil' with a plot. And whenever someone will tell me that I have no reason to be skeptical over 'Brazil''s reputation, I'll lay the 'Twelve Monkeys' card and say that this is at least a film that features the same dystopian future, the same 'world is hell' message, the same maddening confusion, but it makes sense and not just on a psychological level. I was surprised of how emotionally involving it was.I used to consider 'The Fisher King' very highly but I might regard 'Twelve Monkeys' as Terry Gilliam's masterpiece.",9,2,3,31 December 2016
Mississippi Burning," Hatred isn't something you're born with ...
","Based on the true story of three civil rights workers' murders, Alan Parker's 'Mississippi Burning' is a fictionalized dramatization of the investigation, conducted by two opposite FBI agents, both remarkably played by Willem Dafoe and Gene Hackman.Defoe is the young Ward, a bureau-procedure oriented 'Kennedy boy' while Hackman is the older Anderson, less direct, but wiser and subtler in his approach. A Southerner himself, he understands the necessity of charming and sweet-talking the close-mouthed people of Jessup County, whose mentalities echo the dustiness of their town. Their antagonism is North vs. South in microcosm in the sad historical and geographical context of two cultures coexisting in an atmosphere of segregation, fear, and violence, all of them, one-sided. This tension creates a constantly anxious feeling as to plunge us into the dark and swampy context of Mississippi, 1964  appearing on a black screen while gunshots are fired.Through 'Mississippi Burning', one of the best films of the 80's, Alan Parker delivers a profoundly humanistic message inviting people not to understand, but to be able to understand. And I can understand how white people would find some matter to criticize from the unsympathetic portrayal of the South as I can understand how black people would feel offended by their depiction as passive victims only saved by the providential intervention of the North. But this overlooks that the most touching character played by Frances McDormand is a Southerner, born in Jessup and not only she's sweet and loving but under the caring influence of Anderson, will give him crucial information. As it would be overseeing the part that black people played in the film, the anger expressed during the heart-breaking eyes-opening eulogy, the courage of Aaron, the little boy, and the people who defended their rights with what were at hands.I wasn't even twelve when I watched 'Mississipi Burning' for the first time with my Dad, a Sunday night, and something really affected me, I guess it was my first mature introduction to racism in movies. It touched something so deep inside me that I couldn't help but think 'This is so wrong!' Besides innocence, there was also a sort of genuine rationality speaking, 'how could even people do that?' But I guess I was also guilty of a patronizing attitude as if I was happy for the poor victims to be helped, denying the significant role they played in this historical fight for Civil Rights in 1964. And maybe this is why I always watched and re-watched that film whenever I had this opportunity, almost as if I needed to always 'get' more from it, and to appreciate in the 'right way', to be 'able to understand'.And now, it's not the kid speaking but the young man, who 17 years after, learned –and I think it's an improvement- to put things into perspective. I watched the film again, and as you know how it happens, you have some particular scenes that get stuck in your memories, not the most impacting necessarily. I am not going to enumerate all of them, but there is one little moment particularly insightful. When Stephen Toboloswky as the leader of the Klan, was giving his speech about the Anglo-Saxon Christian Pride and the necessity of racial segregation to protect Mississippi's identity, this message full of hatred ignited the cheers of an illuminated audience. And the moment I remembered the most was this cute little blonde girl, applauding, with a sweet but creepy hypnotized look. She's like proud to belong to this people who're –in her mind- the best in the world.Later, it's like a translation into words of that simple moment. Frances McDormand talks about the trivialization of hatred, the way it's taught from cradle to grave, based on a fallacious reading of the Bible. This is not an alibi for racism, not at all, but a powerful attempt to prevent the film from Manichaeism, it's not plain racism, it's about ignorance, bigotry and hatred, and how Ward and Anderson discover the roots of this hatred, incarnated by the heinous face of the most detestable racist, admirably portrayed by Michael Rooker, and the hypocritical sneaky eyes of Brad Dourif, as the Klan-connected Sheriff's Deputy. The casting is full of familiar faces including Gailard Startain as the Sheriff and R. Lee Ermey as the Mayor, another reason for me to re-watch the film, although Hackman's performance tops them all.How the pride to belong to a group can be perverted by another corollary sentiment: to be superior. It's all a matter of perspective, and it's interesting that this comes from the director of a movie I truly admire and that I always defended, 'Midnight Express' where the only way to overcome the racist simplification was to see things from each one's perspective. And 'Mississippi Burning' is a remarkable hymn for peace and understanding driven by an extremely well-written script, and the dynamic between Ward and Anderson and the way the investigation will progress through the use of each one method. Ward believes in the law, Anderson, to get in the same level than your enemies, both are right and wrong in the same time, but their antagonism is mainly because of misunderstanding.Misunderstanding  whether it's ignorance, or 'being poor', some people need to believe in 'being better'. And while some others believe it's 'morally wrong', they don't change the situation either, maybe we're all part of a hypocrisy surrounding the theme of racism, maybe we all are, not against a racial community, but it could be against a social, sexual or any category etc. We need to have one to feel better than.At the end, black and white sing in unison in a cemetery, a beautiful and positive note undermined by my vision of today's reality, and the way racism is still present, in so many other places in the world, that unlike 1964, are already being forgotten",10,1,3,22 July 2011
Rocky V," Despite a few powerful moments, the lowest point of the 'Rocky' franchise
","In 1972, Stallone couldn't even be an extra in 'The Godfather'. In 1976, he wrote and starred in the year's Best Picture, classic underdog story and franchise starter 'Rocky'. And Roger Ebert saw in him a new Brando.The 80's didn't exactly prove Ebert right but they consolidated his star-status. 1982 was his peak with the success of 'Rocky III' and the release of 'First Blood' that introduced another landmark of American cinema: John Rambo. The rest of the decade had its share of ups-and-downs making Sly actor and/or director a punching ball for the Razzies. His 'Rocky IV', while the most successful sport-movie of all time wasn't exactly a critical success, even among the fans.So 1990 wasn't exactly Sly's finest hour with his starlight fading in favor of rivals like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis. That convinced him to approach Rocky with the same angle. There's always a parallel between Rocky and Stallone's story and the idea of taking Rocky back to his roots, to simpler values like family and friends was actually good. The 80's were over, the iron curtain was open, and Gordon Gekko in jail. But from Stallone's own admittance, he made the film out of greed and rated it a zero. So maybe what lacked in 'Rocky V' was a sincere approach to a material that looked good on the paper.Taking Rocky back to the blue-collar streets of Philadelphia was only viable if there was a good story-line to justify it. Unfortunately, 'Rocky V' while not a mediocre film never really fulfills its potential, despite many touching moments, it often gets lost in the realms of cheap predictable made-for-TV stuff. Stallone is wrong when he gives the film a 'zero', he's a good actor, passable director, great writer when he puts his heart in but not much of a critic. Some scenes in 'V' belong to the best of the franchise and make it even better than 'Rocky IV', which was build on a predictable 'death-followed-by-revenge' plot, the story-line of every 80's sports movie.But I love the way 'Rocky V' puts you in the Drago match' immediate aftermath, with Rocky shaking and trembling like a frail puppy, asking Adrian to take him home, you could tell he was tired of this 'nonsense'. But then the press conference back in America features so many cringe-worthy moments every hope in cinematic excellence had definitely vanished. I couldn't believe journalists would ask Rocky for a come-back the minute he set his feet on the American ground, I wanted him to pull a Tony Montana and shout 'What was the Drago hit- a game of dominoes or something?'. So many things belonged to the 'Idiot Script' formula, when you wait for one line to be said, but it doesn't come because you've got to wait for the most dramatic instant.Rocky could tell the journalists that he was suffering from brain damage and the case was rested. The film even involves a subplot with the growing father-and-son relationship between Rocky as a mentor and Tommy 'Machine' Gun, making his son Rocky Jr. jealous, but instead of talking to his father, Jr. becomes more and more rebellious until we get to the obligatory confrontation where they come to terms. And the moment where Rocky makes up with his son is conveniently the same where Tommy turns into a one-dimensional ungrateful villain, it's not exactly the kind of smooth transition we're getting used to. It took Rocky, Adrian and Paulie three, four movies to evolve, Rocky Jr. and Tommy one hour.This is the same kind of flaw that undermined 'Rocky IV', when characters start to behave according to a script rather than a realistic arc, just like Apollo when he was teasing and mocking a Russian giant who was obviously in better shape, as if his defeats with Rocky didn't humble him a bit. It's a shame that Stallone didn't rewrite the script, because Rocky Jr. and Tommy were interesting characters, and well played by the two deceased actors Sage Stallone and Tommy Morrison but it seems like the purpose of their presence was to highlight some need from Rocky to pass the torch, to be the Mickey of someone. Fair enough, but I hated the way relationships always worked on the kind of binary 'On/Off' level that damaged the film's credibility.But the biggest flaw of all was that poor man's Don King played by Richard Grant, he chewed the script every time he was in, and was like the most irritating presence, where was this guy in the previous Rocky? Who the hell was this Union Cane? They even went as far as calling him George Washington Duke while there's another Duke in the film, to add to the confusion. The film is set in 1985 but it is obvious we're in 1990, if new boxing figures were to come, if Rocky had to lose money and get poor again, and last but not least, if Robert 'Rocky' Jr. was supposed to be 14, then just set the film five years after the fourth, and at least, you'll gain a few points in credibility and not have one of the most inexplicable goofs ever.The film, directed by the late John G. Avidsen featured some really powerful scenes, including a flashback with Mickey, allowing us to see Burgess Meredith one last time, a great confrontation between Rocky and Adrian, and an interesting ending showing how Tommy was more of a mislead guy than a villain but 'Rocky V' tangles way too much between mediocrity and excellence. Well, let's call it uneven despite good intentions.Or maybe we should be thankful it flopped, since it allowed Rocky to make his great 'Rocky Balboa' which revitalized the franchise and allowed 'Creed' and a second Oscar nomination to happen. In 1990, the franchise was over but you know what Rocky says about things being over, right?",5,0,0,20 August 2017
Argo," A mission as unbelievable as Ben Affleck's Oscar snub for its direction ...
","An ingenious plan like in 'The Sting', a hostile environment like in 'Midnight Express', a gripping cat-and-mouse chase like in 'The French Connection' and a life-and-death crisis like 'Dog Day Afternoon', 'Argo' borrows so many elements plot and style-wise from 70's classics, that for one second, I wondered if it wasn't from the same era it was grippingly depicting.'Argo' is based on the 1979 Iran hostage crisis that hooked the American audience for more than a year and sealed the political fate of President Jimmy Carter, but while it takes places during the crisis, the plot focuses on the close escape of six American diplomats from the Iranian 'devil's claw', thanks to a cover plan, meticulously crafted by Mendez (Ben Affleck), a CIA agent and expert in ex-filtration with the help of his best friend and colleague O'Donnell (Bryan Cranston). Ben Affleck stars as both the lead actor and the director of 'Argo', which makes the mention of Warren Beatty in one of the film's funniest line, quite fitting. Indeed, with his black dark beard and eyes constantly full of angst and concentration, he reminded me of Warren Beatty in 'Reds', the epic he both starred in and directed. Affleck, never too demonstrative or showy, displays the same level of maturity and technical realism that places him among the most actor-directors of his generation (or has he still something to prove?)The main accomplishment of 'Argo' is to be one of the most suspenseful thrillers of the last years, without exploiting the ordinary archetypes. No gun fights, no car chases, no explosions, the film is structured like a cat-and-mouse chase where each step is a life-and-death situation, and no mistake can be allowed. But let's get back to the 'plot'. The hostages' escape remained Top Secret until the case was finally declassified in 1997, and it's unbelievable that no director thought of adapting the story, if one thing, the material begs for a film. I don't want to reveal much of 'Argo''s plot » because I suspect it would spoil a significant part of the enjoyment, which is the elaboration and the application of a clever plan: simulating the making of a film like 'Battle of the Planet of the Apes' set in an exotic location.With the help of John Chambers, an award-winning make-up artist, played by John Goodman and Lester Siegel, a producer, played by a scene-stealing Alan Arkin, Mendez understands the necessity of not omitting any single detail, everything must sound plausible. The film must have a script, a producer, and publicity, like an article in 'Variety', all precautions that would reveal to be determinant. This is where the real delights of 'Argo' are: once you get deeper in the plan, the film takes off to a series of disguises and manipulations punctuated by the project's catchphrase: « Argo F-yourself ».The film blends many elements of drama and comedy but never distracting from the spellbinding suspense. The tension remains intact because at any moment, the plan can either fail or be canceled. One IMDb user complained about the predictability of the ending that ruined all the suspense, but we know the film wouldn't have been made if the plan had failed, so, it's all in the how that our hearts are hanging. On that level, suspense, action, the film has nothing to envy to today's overly spectacular and noisy actions films. 'Argo' is a captivating thriller, absorbing you at each step of the escape, from the Canadian embassy to a local bazaar and pinnacling in an airport where you could feel the same tension than Billy Hayes in 'Midnight Express'.And the reason I mentioned Parker's film is to tunnel the review toward the only seemingly flaw or invitation for criticism, which is the relatively unflattering portrayal of most Iranian people, as a cruel and angry-driven mob or easily fooled people in the best case. Granted the timing of the film isn't the most inspired with the whole accusations pointed against the Persian state, and the way it kind of damages the positive effect, last year's Oscar-winning 'A Separation' had on the perception of Iran. But I'm inclined to give 'Argo' the benefit of doubt, for simple reasons. The film doesn't make big heroes out of the main protagonists, they are only trapped people trying to save their skins. The religious fervor and violence displayed can be associated with the troubled times induced by the Iranian revolution and the hostility toward the United States. Besides, the film is obviously told from the US perspective, so we can't deny that there were facing some hostility because of the US political choices, but this hostility is handled with the same realism than Gavras' 'Missing', a whole country can have a nightmarish feel, but it trusts the viewer's intelligence, to put the film in its context.And like in 'Missing', in the same degree of partiality, America isn't spared from criticism, since some political involvements are discussed, and subtly denouncement like the opening monologue that established the role of the United States in the coup d'état that installed the Shah as a puppet leader. 'Argo' is intelligent enough to make us close our eyes on some negative portrayals, quite insignificant. On the whole, it's a plot-driven film rather than a character study, which should be watched for the thrills, the suspense, and a sort of educational value, to know how to deal in time of crisis, and realize that sometimes, the craziest plans are the most successful. As O'Donnell says 'this is the best bad plan we have'.What else to say? Well, 'Argo' is a splendid achievement on the field of film-making, definitely one of the year's best if only for the scene when an agent talks Sci-Fi film with an Iranian civil servant, you wouldn't believe it happened? Hell, since Ben Affleck was spared a Best Director Oscar nomination, anything can happen.",9,1,3,5 February 2013
12 Angry Men," Is '12 Angry Men' a GREAT or NON GREAT movie? Gentlemen of the jury, your verdict ...
","Juror #1, the foreman (Martin Balsam, football coach): 'Well, I won't be too technical, or make a long speech  it's just that it's a one-set film, so it's new and risky, because you know, dialogs are not enough, we need uh  the thrills  and it goes slowly in the beginning but progressively, it's like the jury room becomes smaller, and the faces bigger. I really felt the tense and suffocating atmosphere ... And what an explosive climax, I could hardly breathe  I know it's strange, but the direction, well, the movie is one hell of a thriller  I, well, my verdict is clear: GREAT MOVIE' Juror #2 (John Fiedler, bank clerk): 'I don't know. It's an excellent film, served by great performances. Every character was convincing, so were their interactions. I can't find any flaw, for me, there's nothing to add, and nothing to remove. It is a GREAT MOVIE' Juror #3 (Lee J. Cobb, businessman): 'I told you why this movie is great, it's just  thought provoking, everything and I mean everything looked like it would have been this kind of preachy film with a good-hearted hero and simple-minded antagonists who just want to be vindictive. But this is an intelligent film which, even at the end, makes you question if the kid is guilty or not. Because it has nothing to do with punishment, it's about justice ... without any prejudice, and that deserves respect, yes sir! No doubt for me  GREAT MOVIE'Juror #4 (E.G. Marshall, stockbroker): 'First of all, it's an excellent examination of all the subtle nuances that enrich a male adult demography, played with such believability every one could identify with one of the jurors. Secondly, the writing was intellectually gripping and emotionally engaging and I would add: respectful of the viewer's intelligence. The direction was excellent and created a feeling of growing claustrophobia guided by a very clever use of focal lenses, a credit to Sidney Lumet. Last but not least, it's about the noble concept of justice and presumption of innocence: '12 Angry Men' delivers a brilliant, intelligent, and universally inspiring message. To conclude, I can say I had the privilege to watch a GREAT MOVIE'Juror #5 (Jack Klugman, the man from the slum): 'What else to say? I second the idea that it's a powerful drama demonstrating how prejudices poison the heart of our civilization, and I believe this is one of the few films that should be screened everywhere in the world as a powerful lesson for tolerance. My verdict is: GREAT MOVIE'Juror #6 (Edward Binns, painter): 'A movie that younger and future generations should watch and respect. These are movies with no special effects, no big-star cast, no big explosions, no flashy cars and no sexy girls. You have a honest, simple movie featuring ordinary men, but the result is so impacting it should be appreciated by any movie lover, regardless of his or her age. Anyway, GREAT MOVIE'Juror #7 (Jack Warden, salesman): 'Come on, everyone is using big words and noble concepts, but for me, this movie is just damn entertaining. Hey admit it, the dialogs, the way opposite characters interact, create a lot of anxiety but is also very fun to watch, sometimes, well  I think you can say anything, but without entertainment, a film is worthless, and the movie could've been a bore, just all talk and no walk, but it wasn't, it worked for me ... GREAT MOVIE'Juror #8 (Henry Fonda, architect): 'This movie invites us to explore our convictions and question the way they influence our judgments. Justice is done by men, blindly and implacably, this is why punishment must be beyond any doubt, and when you have what appears to be an open-and-shut case that progressively reveals some flaws as we go deeper in the subject, well, this says a lot about the negative impact of subjectivity when it comes to justice, and how we should be careful about the consequences of our thoughts, our words, our acts. '12 Angry Men' is a humanistic inspiration for those who have faith in justice. GREAT MOVIE'Juror #9 (Joseph Sweeney, retired): 'This is a fantastic character study illustrating how convincingness is often driven by the personality. It's an incredible illustration of the way a few people can monopolize the talk and how a silent majority is eager to follow the ones who aggressively express their thoughts, and the courage it takes to be the lone dissenter and how using a constructive, polite and logical answer can destroy something taken for granted. While watching '12 Angry Men' I understood that a consensus, when rapidly built, means that the truth must be elsewhere. And one truth for sure, this is a GREAT MOVIE'Juror #10 (Ed Begley, garage owner): 'I hate the patronizing way some left-wing good-hearted people adore this film, this has nothing to do with politics, truth or justice, it's about manipulation of your thoughts by pushing the right emotional button  you missed the point, and that's the beauty of the film, you're all easily fooled. Not for the reasons you think, but it's a GREAT MOVIE'Juror #11 (Joseph Voskovek, watchmaker): 'No need to be American to appreciate the beauty of this film, it's about our deepest convictions. It's about the humanistic concept of reasonable doubt which can save even a guilty soul ... because life is valuable and justice is not vengeance. GREAT MOVIE'Juror #12 (Robert Webber, advertising executive): 'Wow, what I can say, it's not an exact science you know  you can find a reason A to appreciate it, a reason B or C  let's just say that the 'sigma' of these reasons, explains why it's an incredible film and as my fellow jurors said, why '12 Angry Men' is a GREAT MOVIE'",10,18,29,14 March 2011
Beauty and the Beast," Disney as its most 'classic'... whatever it means...
","Because she was unfairly judged by her horrid looks, an old witch casts a spell on an arrogant prince, turning him into a horrendous beast, and the spell extends to every person working in the castle, turned to the furniture they usually handle in their respective job. The ways of magic are impenetrable in Disney's world. But like any Disney spell, it can be broken if the Prince finds true love: if he's capable to love someone and in return, inspires similar feelings. This is a doomed-to-fail mission as no possible girl could ever love a beast.But Belle isn't any girl; she's a French village's local oddity, a free-spirited, fresh and charming girl who keeps her nose stuck on books while wandering on the streets, attracting all the astonished reactions. Belle doesn't care for material stuff, she's a dreamer, in reading, she seeks escapism in its most extraordinary forms, and that she's the daughter of a goofy inventor accentuates her peculiarity, and her charm. And one man fixed his choice on Belle, his name is Gaston and he's the village macho icon, a colossal brute whose strength equals his stupidity, and who can't stand seeing Belle playing 'hard to get'. Gaston slowly turns from a comical buffoon to a more sinister villain. And this is what 'Beauty and the Beast' is all about: transformations, evolution, but never at the expenses of disbelief. This is the magic of Disney, we can accept a teapot with the voice of Angela Lansbury, a candlestick with the facial features and unmistakable accent of Maurice Chevalier or the failed jokes of a clock-shaped butler. We can accept the extraordinarily horrific face of the Beast who's an improbable combination of a lion's mane, wolf's legs, buffalo's face and boar's mug. But there's one thing that all the 'Fantasy' can't buy and it is the growing chemistry between Belle and the Beast. We know when she becomes the hostage in the castle, it's a matter of time before the romance blooms but it's all in the way this is handled. There's indeed more than 'Stockholm Syndrome'.'Beauty and the Beast' takes an old classic theme but turns into a serious and legitimate drama: to earn the princess' love, the Beast will have to risk his furry neck, to learn to accept his mistakes, and even to let 'her' leave the castle as sometimes, this is the greatest proof of love. On her side, Belle will also discover the strange attraction and its final blossoming at the film's climax. The romance is handled in such a way that it never feels like a rehash of the older Disney. But if I had to mention the previous movies, I would say that 'Beauty and the Beast' is to 'The Little Mermaid' what 'Pinocchio' was to 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs', the proof that the former film's success wasn't just a strike of luck and that the animators still got it and could surprise you when you thought it was impossible to match the delights and thrills of the previous one. With 'Mermaid', Disney inaugurated the Renaissance period and established new grounds, that only Disney could ever break or surpass. And with 'Beauty and the Beast', they created a formidable precedent by making the first ever animated feature to be nominated to a Best Picture Oscar, along with such other prestigious titles as 'Silence and the Lambs' and 'JFK'. Many Pixar movies achieved the same stunt ('Up' and 'Toy Story 3'), but it's easier to sneak in when you have eight to ten available spots. 'Beauty and the Beast' was certainly no filler.I insist on these Oscar considerations because 'Beauty and the Beast' is really one of a kind, it is such a big-scaled prestigious visual feast that it might leave smaller audiences craving a bit underwhelmed. Speaking for myself, as I had the chance to be the target core of the Disney Renaissance, 'Beauty and the Beast' has never been one of my favorites, not in the sense that I disliked it but because I would always find better reasons to enjoy 'Aladdin', 'The Lion King' or 'The Jungle Book'. Revisiting this classic 25 years after its release (time flies), I understand why: this is a great film on its own right, and not just as a Disney animated feature.And it wasn't just nominated for Best Picture, but it was also included in major lists from the American Film Institute: Songs, Romances but is the only animated feature to have made it in the 'Musical' category, which says a lot because all the previous Disney movies have been musicals. But in the case of 'Beauty and the Beast', the musical moments are staged like in Broadway comedies, the opening song even borrows from 'West Side Story' and Belle has something of Maria from 'Sound of Music'. But 'Beauty' didn't just reused common staples of musical, it became a staple itself as the film would be parodied countless times, from the unforgettable 'See my Vest' where Mr. Burns reveals his devilish puppy scheme to the 'Mountain Song' in 'South Park', and one can even see similar plot lines between the film and the movie 'Shrek'.'Beauty and the Beast' is an instant classic and the living incarnation of Disney's magic, it doesn't have the zaniness or little spice that can create an extra appeal, but that's because the film had more serious ambitious and doesn't even deny it in its titular song, as the tale is 'as old as time', stories or 'seemingly impossible loves'. And maybe like Belle, now, I can see the beauty of 'Beauty in the Beast', if only because it's so magnificently hand-drawn and Belle looks more expressive than any 3D princess. (And don't get me started on that moment where we get to see the real 'Featherduster', perhaps the Disney moment that most turned me on)",9,3,3,31 December 2016
The English Patient," Love as the existential antithesis of war...
","Adapted from Michael Ondaatje's novel, Anthony Minghella's 'English Patient' belongs to a Hollywood tradition of war-epics sweeping several Oscars, including the so 'year-defining' Best Picture, and condemned to inspire such questions as: why did this film win the Best picture over 'Fargo' or 'Jerry Maguire'? Seriously, the only question that deserves to emerge is: does it matter?This is a film that is as much about War as say, 'Jerry Maguire' is about sports, war is incidental to the people's lives but their lives and their relationships are still the real thing. Remember that line from 'Casablanca': 'it doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world.' All the greatest war movies have contributed to discredit good old Rick; he has a point that on the big scale of war, the global outcome is what really matters but seriously, shouldn't we weep for the people who die on the screen because worse things happen off-screen? People die at war, it's the very essence of war, and if their sacrifice or death allows a few victories on the short term, well, we find the strength to accept the tragedies, but all the acceptance in the world can affect the emotional resonance one's death has on us.Indeed, what is cinema if not a medium intended to make us care for what goes on, and primarily on the screen? 'Schindler's List' is incredibly sad because of the innocent lives killed over the course of the Nazi's persecutions and executions, but the story is told in such a way that we're also glad for the survivors who, with the help of Schindler, managed to go through the hellish war. Inversely, in 'Saving Private Ryan', while we're supposed to cheer for his survival, we can't get quite over the loss of all the soldiers who went looking for him. In war films, we care for people not for wars, if anything, wars teach about humanity more than any other genre and 'The English Patient' is no exception. One of the scene that haunted me the most was during a celebration of peace, everyone was chanting, drinking, dancing and cheering, glad to be finally back home and move forward, and then an explosion pooped the party the worst way. One of the officers hanged the British flag on a booby trap and died instantly. Now, this death had upset me more than any other one and the man wasn't even one of the main characters, but I found his death incredibly sad because it happened 'after' the war, as if the bombs should have been magically defused by the power of peace, as if it happened at a moment where no one was supposed to die anymore. It's the unpredictability of death that made it harder to accept, because all through the film, our minds were set to accept people dying. This one, by catching me off guard, revealed to me the essence of war: it makes death more acceptable.But the power of love is that it can't make death acceptable whether in war or peace time. And in a way, 'The English Patient' is about deaths that shouldn't have happened if it wasn't for that fateful global conflict. Many people populate the film, and they're never identified by their backgrounds but by the people they love in return, the people they care or cared for, the ones they befriended or been married to. The film is made of two intersected stories, it's about a mysterious aviator (Ralph Fiennes) whose plane has burnt during a secret mission, he is taken care in Italy by a Canadian nurse, Hana, played by Juliette Binoche, who uses a villa as an improvised little hospital. Several men join her, a Sikh bomb expert played by Naveen Andrews and a mysterious man (Willem Dafoe) who seems to have a personal record to settled with the 'English' patient. Their interactions, flashbacks provide enough to make us want more.The main flashback though is told by the patient, from a time where he was a handsome Hungarian archaeologist, falling in loves with Katharine (Kristin Scott Thomas) the wife of his friend (Colin Firth). This is not a movie that romanticizes infidelity, their bonding is as a natural and inevitable process as war or a sandstorm, some things you just can't fight back and that seem as efficient in putting people together as separating them. The nurse Hana is also an illustration for this need of love, this is not the Florence Nightingale syndrome, but a need to find someone who can give as much as she gives, and if this person doesn't die in war, that would be enough. Binoche is such a naturally delicate and lovable actress, such a sweet and kind person that if someone like her ever lost the capability to love because of death, the tragedy would be worse than any death.But that's the secret of 'The English Patient', by inter-crossing these parallel love and friendship stories, people put their failures into perspective. Even in wars, people don't die completely, their body perish but not their memory, it is a very fitting coincidence that the pre-war period involves map-making, because maps are built on pre-existing territories, you can put any names on them, that doesn't make them exist more. So is love, the memory transcend the actual relationship, it exists as long as you live it, talk about it and let it exist through the memory of other people who'd outlive you. In the film, a solider wants to talk to a man from his town before going, that's what war is about, trying not to completely die. And despite all the deaths that punctuate the story, at the end, Hana lets a beautiful smile illuminate her face, and it's all in the final revelation about the English Patient.",10,1,1,16 October 2016
Madagascar," A silly forgettable plot, but one of the most endearing friendship of animation's history...
","Well, we get it from the characters' designs that 'Madagascar' is no 'Lion King' and from the casting of the voice actors: Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, David Schwimmer, Jada Pinkett Smith and Sacha Baron Cohen, that we'll be heading toward a 'jungle' version of 'A Shark Tale': so many pop-culture references in the soundtrack that we'll lose the track, and the first minutes to play the distracting 'spot-that-star's voice' game.Am I complaining? Not exactly: ever since the battle between Pixar and DreamWorks started with the face-to-face between 'Antz' and 'A Bug's Life', the rivalry allowed each team to fully express where they stood for on the field of imagination. Pixar made family friendly stories while DreamWorks was more focused on adult humor and references that even teenagers wouldn't necessarily get. On that level, 'Madagascar' is pretty consistent with DreamWorks' tone, although it seems that this time, the enjoyment of children wasn't seen as a top priority at all.I had the same complaint about 'A Shark Tale', but I want to withdraw my judgment after 'Madagascar'. Now, this is movie totally made for adults and teenagers, with references to 'New York, New York', to San Diego, to 'American Beauty' during a feeding frenzy hallucinatory sequence and the ambiguous relationship between the two main characters, not to mention the identity crisis plot, only the penguins added the little touch of slapstick and fun the film needed for the little ones. So, I can't put exactly why I didn't enjoy the film as I thought I would, there's just something very confusing about it, and maybe the writing has something to do with it.The opening starts with a fun little nod to 'The Lion King' with Marty the zebra (Chris Rock) playing Tarzan with the sunrise in the background I was wondering where the creepers were hanging down from when he just woke up, his best friend Alex the Lion (which name did you expect? Leo?) wishes him a happy birthday. There have been friends in animated movies but I think I would put Marty and Alex in the Top 3, the two characters are co-leads and together they exchange advice, concerns and views about life like true bros would do. I liked that a lot, it was a genuinely appealing relationship. Now, Marty is 10, which in human years equals 38, he wishes he wouldn't spend the rest of his life in New York Central zoo, but Alex is more of a full-glass type of guy and tries to convince him to seize the day.To complete the picture, there's a sensual and assertive female hippo (size helps) she's named Gloria and it's kind of ironic that she's voiced by the petite Jada Pickett Smith, and a hypochondriac whining giraffe named Melman, voiced by David Schwimmer, the size and the voice fits. Then you get a sort of bestial version of Friends with the zoo as Central Perk and if you still had doubt about these animals' humanity, you get the zebra walking in New York ('Staying Alive' in the background) and the three other animals who know exactly the directions to take in the subway. And if you still had doubts, there's the scene with Alex before he gets the dart, when a lion doesn't understand why he scare humans, that means he can't picture himself as a lion, he's a zoo attraction, he's a star, but not a wild animal, talk about some serious existential issues.A chain of events involving boxes, a ship bound to Kenya and the gang of penguins with remarkable sailing abilities lead our four protagonists to a remote island in Africa. The roles are reversed, Marty is ecstatically surfing with dolphins and enjoying lif, Alex is devastated, put out of his zone of comfort, he's more desperate than any human in a desert island. At this point of the movie, nothing can ever match the comedic originality of the first act when the four animals ventured in the city, but there have been enough animals in the city movies so that the writers wouldn't get further than that. The problem is that there's no much of a plot happening after that, the whole story is about the identity crisis of Alex, and a weird group of lemurs (singing 'I like to move it') and with Sacha Baron Cohen voicing the leader with an Indian accent.The lemurs want Alex to scare their predators, the fossa, but Alex is totally disoriented and tries to repress the resurgence of his savage instincts. What can he do? This is where the film gets tricky, at many points; Marty catches Alex in awkward positions, mostly near his behind. Alex is hungry and starts seeing juicy steaks everywhere. Now, I hate to read gay subtexts everywhere but for the first time, I thought it was pretty obvious although not intended, the food thing is nothing, there's something going on between Alex and Marty. He loves him, he doesn't want to hurt him so he goes away and lives hidden for a short period.There's no way the film could have gone further than that, except if it tried to be 'Fritz the Cat' but the relationship between Alex and Marty was so complex and weird that it totally overshadowed the main plot, which was rather forgettable and whose solution was contrived to the limits of a plot hole. I mean, if you accept that in 'Madagascar' universe, eating living animals is wrong, then the ending doesn't make sense. Maybe that fish was a talking one with Steve Carrel or Matthew Perry's voice, have the writers thought about that? The food was just an excuse to make a film about two complex guys (not animals) with a very 'friendship' (yeah, right) so I only accept 'Madagascar' as an exposition, and I'm looking forward to seeing things evolve in the sequel.",6,0,0,21 August 2016
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Will somebody please think of the children?...
","Being commonly referred as the year that changed movies, it's only fitting that 1999 hasn't lost its historical significance on the field of animation.The year saw the release of Disney's official last animated feature from the 'Renaissance' era, making a successful torch-passing to Pixar animation with the great 'Toy Story 2'. Although there is a natural propensity to label 'Tarzan' the last classic animated film, in my humble opinion, this honor goes to the contender, the unexpected newcomer that blew me away, as a movie viewer, the movie adapted from a 2-year old TV series: 'South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut'.The most remarkable achievement of 'South Park' is its perfect combination between a classic approach to the genre of animation with all the elements that forged the series' controversial reputation, and I'm not only referring to its use of vulgar humor and profanity but also its satirical treatment of timely issues, at a time where 'The Simpsons' was starting to show a slight decline of quality. 'South Park' feels like a two-part episode but with nothing to envy from Disney classic films, the plot is coherent, the film takes us in one of these unexpected climaxes like only the show has the secret, and I'll be damned if the film doesn't feature the greatest set of songs since 'Aladdin'.The songs deserve a whole chapter. The first time I saw 'South Park', I didn't see them coming, it starts with what I thought was a cute homage to 'Beauty and the Beast' with 'Another Quiet Sunday Morning in my Quiet Mountain Town', a sympathetic way to introduce to all the characters (not everyone is familiar with the show after all). Then, the story takes off when the leading quarter Stan, Kyle (and his cute brother Ike) Kenny and Cartman go to the theater to watch the movie version of Terrence and Phillip, featuring the outrageous song with the titular F-verb involving a family member not to mention a very creative use of fart as musical accompaniments.Naturally, there is an uproar following the film's release, 'South Park' prudish inhabitants, mostly mothers, lead by the dominant and hot-tempered Sheila Broflovski condemn the use of profanity, the vulg.wait, didn't I say that before? You got it, it's a self-referential plot where the creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone anticipate the reception of their own movies, something that can be summed up in a catchphrase belonging to the rival series: 'will somebody please think of the children' The mothers form an association in order to protect children and since Terrence and Phillip are Canadian, they don't blame the government, nor society, nor the images of TV, they blame Canada! And right now, I have the 'Canada' march in my ears and without a doubt the song of the year (played during the Academy Awards' Ceremony) 'Blame Canada', the only one to be nominated for an Oscar, which is a shame, because there was at least 2 other titles to include. Indeed, 'What would Brian Boitano Do?' would have been a great second choice, an example of great writing, catchy music and surrealistic fun. If 'The Lion King' had three Oscar-nominated songs, I don't see why, 'South Park' didn't get the same respect. What would a good juror do? Blame the Academy! The plot goes on and on and leads to one of these spectacularly cataclysmic twisted twists we never see coming when we watch 'South Park', resolving a question many would have in mind. Indeed, I've often wondered why it took 17 years for the most successful TV sitcom of all-time 'The Simpsons' to have its movie while 'South Park' was still recent in mind, hell, even Butters wasn't a major player and Mr Garrison was still a man  sadly, even Mary Kay Bergman, pretty much all the female voices in the film was still alive (Rest in Peace to one of the most talented female voices ever whose sudden suicide is the only veil of darkness on the film's shining legacy) Anyway, I guess the fans will know why the show made a movie so early 'South Park' plots often start with an ordinary issue and takes inevitably dramatic proportions flirting with fantasy and surreal humor, it's satire to the extreme. This is why it's not surprising that the last act features a war between America and Canada, Stan's quest of Wendy's Heart and the mystery of the G-spot, and an unexpected cameo from the devil himself and his lover Saddam Hussein  well, I understand the makers won't have a soft spot for the late dictator but I give them the benefit of the doubt, this was pre-11 September era (as if it ever meant something) and not all the members are Hitler-like figures.But the inclusion of hell is a good plot device as it allows one character to be still preeminent even after his death, you know who I'm thinking of, the one that got killed every episode because of some bastards' move. 'South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut' is everything a film can be : an adventure movie, a satire, a coming-of-age story, a fantasy and more than anything, a great musical, this is Golden Globe, what I'm saying, Broadway material and I hope some producers will think of an adaptation, and I'm only half-joking. Witty, intelligent, subversive, the film is perfect to the point it even questions its own criticism through the very plot it features, not 'The Simpsons : Movie', no classic Disney film ever achieved this.And for that achievement, I applaud the film, and me I don't applaud for not getting immediately the joke behind the title.",9,0,0,31 May 2014
The Danish Girl," Lili's legacy deserved better than Redmayne's Oscar-baity pathos...
","In a heartfelt interview related to his role in 'Tootsie', Dustin Hoffman recalled that existential epiphany when he was trying for different ways to look convincing as a woman, he realized that the issue wasn't about how realistic he looked but how beautiful. He then realized how demanding was society toward women and he cried at the thought of many interesting women he missed just because he himself applied that pressure on them. The role allowed him to approach the beauty-burden of women and in that fragment of interview lays one truth that the whole 'The Danish Girl' movie flirts with but never embraces.I know Tom Hooper's film isn't about cross-dressing as much as it's about gender-identity so I'm not comparing the film to 'Tootsie'. However, there comes a moment when the pre-surgery Lili Elbe, played by Eddie Redmayne, enjoys the idea of being believable as a woman and does the best to hide whatever can betray the male assets and deep inside, I couldn't help but feel as though I was watching an actor giving his best shot as a woman, because the initial idea of a woman was to be beautiful, to look sweet and sensitive, to let an innocent chuckle, a few sobbing breaths slip, and Redmayne looked believable in these clichÃ©s situations, but that was all.In a film where you have the wife Gerta, an independent painter and strong female character played by Alicia Vikander, it's rather frustrating to see that a transgender person, once she becomes a woman, abandons all her dreams and makes her best to fit in a female crowd, talking about the last fashion of Paris and giggling like a schoolgirl. In 'Tootsie', being the beautiful woman was the means, in 'The Danish Girl', it's the end. When Lili becomes a woman, I'm sorry if this comparison offends but I immediately thought of Mr. Garrison in 'South Park' who, as soon as he became a woman, enjoyed talking with girls about girly things such as men and the 'curse', it was like joining a club. I know the film goes deeper than that and the real-life story of Lilu is an inspiration for many people who feel trapped in the wrong body, however, I'm blaming the treatment for making the gender identity something as superficial and predictable.For some reason, the film was more effective when it started like a game and Edgar started enjoying the way his modelling inspired a believable lady, having that same Tootsie 'epiphany', when the struggle to search his identity was within the framework of art, the film could deliver its message without being too forceful, and art was the perfect medium. Think about it, what is the purpose of art, it seeks beauty, goodness and truth, a certain truth as perceived by the artist. Lili starts as 'beauty' and then she reveals what Lili feels like the best part of herself and then at the end, it turns out that Lili was the truth, the one she's been longing for, she's his, no, her reality. 'The Danish Girl' starts as a wonderful movie about art and the way it can speak some deep truths about our own personas, only this time, the work of art serves the model's epiphany... it's the idea of being looked at as someone, and then be treated like that someone, and then become that someone, it's a fantastic journey between the realms of reality and art, highlighting the latter's universal language.Tom Hooper had a fantastic material in the original novel written by David Ebershoff, but for some reason, he decided it to turn it into a sober and melancholic drama whose second act is obviously tailor-made to shine a light on an important issue, in other words, it played the Oscar bait thing with the dragging sequences and the sad piano theme. I enjoyed 'The King's Speech' not because of the stuttering performance or because of its climax (it was only a speech after all) but because it told a terrific friendship story, one can argue that 'The Danish Girl' is also a tale of love between a woman and her husband who becomes a woman, but Redmayne plays a frustratingly passive character whose efforts to be a woman are only highlighted through sad monologues, cries and sorry for the term, cross-dressing and impressions that are so artificial that they never show what it is to feel like a woman, only to look like one.Redmayne is a good actor but he pushes the pathos button way too far to make for an enjoyable experience and I'm not sure people who belongs to the community like to be their lives seen as eternal reservoirs of sadness. Vikander pulls off a terrific performance but she's clearly the leading character and while the producers put her in the supporting character to win, we're forced to enjoy Redmayne's continual pathos, regretting these true-to-life moments where even when she looked like a man was playfully posing like a woman. The second act is just the typical biopic material chronicling the final years of Lili and although her life is an inspiration, I wished it inspired more than a fade and pale drama from a director who seems to love playing on the safe side. Lili's legacy deserved better than Redmayne's performance.",7,0,2,24 August 2019
Elizabeth," From the rise to Power to the conquest of Authority ...
","Period films have always been unfairly underrated. My guess is that because of the profusion of historical movies from Hollywood's Golden Age, we've grown with the idea that they were more an excuse for displays of flamboyance, thrilling sword fights and epic battle sequences or exhilarating 'Technicolorgies' than true character studies or introspective examinations into the notions of corruption, integrity, or more generally power: whether it's about a rise, a downfall, or both. Thankfully, the injustice has been fixed, and despite a few exceptions, all the recent period dramas have been a triumph on the field of intelligent storytelling, highlighting the intimate correlation between History and Story (the same word in some languages) something that mirrors our Human condition and raises the notion of knowledge to a universal level. And the power of 'Elizabeth' is to tackle contemporary issues hidden in the austere and dark walls of splendid castles, carrying all the paranoid atmosphere of these plotting times. This is the greatest interest of period movies: their appeal comes from both the lack of visual modernity and the inner modernity of the topics they deal with. In Shekhar Kapur's 'Elizabeth', it's simply about the rise to power.'Elizabeth' invites us to comprehend how a young woman, Protestant in an England, not only Catholic but also intolerant toward those who rejected the Pope, as firmly illustrated in a gut- wrenching bonfire burning scene, how this person, outcast in so many levels, took over the power, and begun a reign that would last 40 years, and turns England, the prey of Europe's most powerful monarchies, into the dominant Nation in Europe. It's not just a woman in a world of men, but also a woman in probably the most vulnerable and fragile moment of England's history. She would take the power after the death of her stepsister, daughter of Henry VIII, but the point was to keep this power, and this was indeed a life and death situation for both Elizabeth, and England. In a way, Elizabeth embodied the situation of England in an ironic but inspirational symbiosis. The most relevant example is the invasion of Scotland by Mary of Guise' French troops coinciding with a proposal to marry the Duke of Anjou, the nephew of the same Mary. Elizabeth would be less married than raped in her honor and she's aware of her dilemma and how it echoes the situation of her beloved people. But the key of this torment is to conquer, before the power, the certitude that she IS the one who rules the country, and the game isn't won yet. As it's said before, all she has are 'enemies', she has a lover too, but the line between the sincerity of his love and his secret ambition are thin to the limit of imperceptibility.Elizabeth's other dilemma is with the bishops, a powerful Catholic congregation refusing to pay allegiance to the queen who dared to deny the Pope's influence. Probably the first turning point of Elizabeth's rise to power is her first confrontation with the bishops, where she explains the reasons of her attitude toward the Pope, how can one be faithful to two countries in the same time. As she said, not without a delighted irony, it's all a matter of 'common sense'. Whether she gained the sympathy of her audience is not the point, at least, she's assessing her independence as a religious person, a first step, before assessing her independence as a woman-to-marry, then a woman, and final step: a Head of State, from Elizabeth to the Virgin Queen, a long process occupying the first two thirds of the film.And the force of the film is to never detach itself from the plot's basis, which is to understand the progressive domestication of a throne, of a country, which is like a savage horse that refuses to be ridden. And never falling into simplification, it takes its time to depict all the interactions and influences that would forge the growing authority of Elizabeth. It's about succession and conquest of authority, which is the cement that builds the durability of power. And when we consider how both Elizabeth and England were when the film begun, it becomes one of the most interesting character studies and evolutions in cinema's recent history.It would even remind of another classic: 'The Godfather'. Both movies are about a character so underestimated because of an outcast status and apparent weakness (being a civilian/ being a woman) that the conquest of authority is even more captivating. As viewers, watching these films where an underdog becomes a ruthless but charismatic powerful figure is as delightful as reading some pages of Machiavelli's 'Prince'. And this is not a fortuitous comparison: when in the last chapters, you read how some cruel acts can help to consolidate a power, you can't help but think of 'Elizabeth''s climax that resonates like the 'Godfather''s Baptism Massacre sequence.And after the climax, the movie takes a new dimension, as we don't just understand the nature of power, but of monarchy. Why this appeal for kings and queens? Because God is so untouchable that we need human figures that incarnate this power in the face of Earth. It almost sounds heretic but if you read the Constitution of most monarchies, you're always to find the mark of religion, and whether this representative power has declined, kings and queens have always been a model of metaphysical fascination. And when they commit cruel acts, the veneration is so strong and the adoration so sincere that we would all find convenient alibis, for people allowed to act as a God-like figure.This is what being a Queen is about and probably the words implicitly written by the last scene where Elizabeth sits in the throne. And Cate Blanchett, 'Blanche' as the impressive whiteness that painted the Queen's new 'virginity' is simply perfect in this powerful examination of the roots of power.",9,1,2,2 November 2011
Ted," Finally, a good use for CGI...
","This is the story of a 35-year old guy named John Bennett, played by Mark Walhberg, who's victim of such a common syndrome in people of our generation, he's an 'adu-lescent', basically, an adult who refuses to grow up, and keeps on enjoying a hedonistic life made of sex, drugs and house parties. I don't know if the word is used in English, but anyway, think of Judd Appatow's comedies' male protagonist and you'll get the point. And this John Bennet leads his hedonistic life with Ted, his 27-year old best friend. But John has a job and a beautiful girlfriend named Lori Collins, and played by Mila Kunis, who wants to make plans with him, but he must show that he's capable of being an adult and convincing Ted to let him live his life. That's 'Ted' in a nutshell.Oh yes, and Ted is a Teddy Bear. One of the most memorable CGI creatures of recent years, who provided Mark Walhberg one of his greatest roles, in the same vein of touching weirdness and comical performance than the late Bob Hoskins in 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit'.I can imagine Seth MacFarlane pitching the film to the producer, a few sentences and you can hear a cash-machine sound in the background. Just when you get the story, a man whose best friend is a talking teddy bear, you understand it is a comedy of opposition, think about it, a big, smiling, cute and fluffy teddy bear, symbol of childhood and innocence, acting like a horny foul-mouthed animal party, this is an offer a producer can't resist to. But from our experienced viewers' perspective, as promising as the synopsis sounds, we wonder how long such a gimmick can be maintained before losing its appeal. MacFarlane is a terrific writer when it comes to animated sitcom episodes (such as 'Family Guy' or 'American Dad') but there's no fundamental difference between the premise of 'Ted' and 'Howard the Duck'. 'Ted' could've been a disaster.Or 'Ted' could have been 'just a good film', but guess what, it's slightly better than that because of how surprisingly good it is. Actually, what could have been the basis of a sketch or a 'Family Guy' manages to drive a story-line of a hundred minutes in an exciting and entertaining way. And this is owes a lot to the fact that Ted is handled like a full and three-dimensional character from the very start. The film opens in 1980 when a friendless boy (so alone he's even mocked by the poor Jewish kid who's getting his annual Christmas beating) and when he gets a Teddy Bear, he makes a predictable wish which predictably becomes real. Ted speaks, much to his buddy's delight and his parents' horror, but then the magic of Christmas operates, what happens next, within the film's fantastic universe, is handled with very smart realism.No, the parents don't hide Ted, why should they? Ted becomes a local oddity then an instant celebrity, invited to the Johnny Carson's show, and so forth. And then like many 80's wonders and other 90's stars such as Corey Feldman or Frankie Muniz, he sadly sunk into oblivion. And after that, this is where the film won me. I thought John would get rid of Ted and then the teddy-bear would come back to his life, but would have that made sense? Why would you even lose your best friend, one that understands you perfectly, one that grows an intense complicity with you and one who was raised on the same cult-programs than you? No, Ted remained his friend and very much his friend for 27 years, and when we meet them, they act together like true bros, Ted might be a gimmick for us to discover, but he's a fully developed character nonetheless.The film takes a departure from films like 'Howard the Duck' or 'Paul' where the strangeness relies on Sci-fi elements. The fantasy here allows the film to get away with all the 'why's and 'how's and spare us some distracting special effects. Here, the plot centers on relationships, and the way love can undermine friendships and vice versa. And when you suspect it will be impossible for Ted to leave John's life because he's got nowhere to go, the film takes you by surprise by making his independent life absolutely possible. The screenplay, written by Macfarlane is the best asset of the film, because it creates unpredictable situations out on predictable material. There's no scene that hasn't been seen before, but in 'Ted', it works because it doesn't try to be original, it just sticks to Ted's irresistible personality and the contrast with his appearance.Of course, there's a lot of things happening in the film, a mysterious buyer obsessed with the Bear and played by a creepy-looking Giovani Ribisi, there's Lori's boss and occasional stalker whose efforts to conquer her hearts always meet with answers you never really see coming, there are also one of the most memorable cinematic parties with a mysterious guest star, and of course, there are some delicious interactions between Ted and characters of female persuasion, even a nice cameo as one of his ex's, one you never see coming. This is a film that is really caring about making us laugh and manages to take a concept à la 'American Dad' (one of the best written animated shows) and make a story out of it, one full of crazy one-liners, raunchy but never vulgar dialogues, or never vulgar at the expenses of humor, and one of the funniest concluding voice-over monologue.And beyond the laughter, Ted is humanized in such a way you can't look at him as a Teddy Bear, but he's so cute and adorable you can't ignore that. What a fascinating paradox!",8,2,2,2 May 2016
Oldboy," Oh Boy!
","'Laugh and the world laughs with you. Weep and you weep alone.'Never have truer words been said. And I agree with the second part even more. This is a film where the hero and the villain are both lonely individuals because they're in a grieving process. But you can't be truly heroic or villainous when you're that pathetic, so 'Old Boy' is less the tale of an upcoming good-vs-evil confrontation than the journey of a man who was stolen part of his life and had the remains to give it the only possible meaning: knowledge first, then revenge.I won't spoil the twist, one brilliant paradigm the film provides is that sometimes it's not about looking for the right answers but asking the right questions. But I'm talking in abstractions, let's just get into reviewing mode. Oh-Daeh Su is a man we first see drunk in a police station, he missed his daughter's birthday and is ready to go home when he's suddenly kidnapped and jailed in an apartment where he's given food, clean laundry and a TV as his only connection to the world, like Peter Sellers' character in 'Being There'.TV teaches him one thing or two when the rest of the experience hardens him. At that moment we're hooked already, we want to see his escape and want to know what this average-looking man ever did to deserve this? The way he 'gets off' is an indicator that the film isn't exactly trying to match our expectations. Indeed, it's not as simple because it's much simpler than we'd have anticipated, he's released and finds himself with new clothes, a cellphone, and time to readapt to the city he left.There's even a scene that echoes 'Being There' where he's confronted to street thugs, Oh Daeh-Su says 'Can 10 years' worth of imaginary training... be put to use?' Apparently it can, and his fifteen years of isolation improved his physical skills as much as they damaged the social ones. Yet, everything feels too convenient, too weird, even in a restaurant, a young girl named Mido seems to grow an infatuation on him... even after he did the grossest thing ever; eating a live octopus! Is the film falling in the romance trap? Wait till the end, that's not the right question to ask.Now why did he eat the animal? That's a question. 'To feel something alive in his mouth after having been deprived from life' seems like an organic answer, remember that Oh Daeh-Su has been totally desensitized from life and naturally pain, taking the life out of an animal or a human being would make him feel alive again as if he had sucked the juice of life to feel something again.The 'octopus' scene sets our mind to the most gruesome parts where Oh Daeh-Su tracks down his captors until he finds his former warden and pulls seven teeth out before getting the names. All the discretion shots in the world can't distract from disturbing 'Marathon Man' vibes but here again, it's not just about shocking for the kicks. When Oh Daeh-Su pulls off the tooth, believe it or not, he's the one suffering, he's the one who has surrendered to his bestial nature to commit atrocities he never thought he could.As he says: 'Even though I'm no more than a monster - don't I, too, have the right to live?' And living, as far as he's concerned, is looking for the answers, there's something worse than suffering which is suffering for no reason, this could apply for violence in films, it can only work if there's a reason. So for a film so inclined to disturbing acts of violence, it's interesting that its central theme is knowledge.The film puts us in the mind of someone who wants to know but maybe the truths it's ready to reveal would make his torment worse, his life more hellish, but he's willing to take the risk... this is why you can't judge the film without considering its antagonist. Woo Jin-Lee is everything Oh Daeh-Su is not, he's handsome (very actually), rich, confident and he defines himself as a scholar in Oh Daeh-Su. So we have the man who wants to know and the scholar.And as the cat-and-mouse chase goes on and the plot gets thicker, Woo Jin-Lee's cool and detached demeanor fades out to unveil as tragic depths as Oh Daeh-Su did so we understand that they were the perfect match to each other until the climactic face-off. And like Bill in 'Kill Bill', it's not just black and white morality. I know, you could see a 'Kill Bill' allusion coming, there are so many parallels to draw between the two films and it's a fitting coincidence that QT was the Cannes Festival and gave the film its Grand Prize, but 'Old Boy' flies high miles above American Cinema.Indeed, calling it a revenge story, an action film or a psychological thriller wouldn't give you one tenth of the idea. American movies have proven that a good editing, a compelling story and shocking value are integral to a film's success but I blame them for having given me the wrong idea about that South Korean's gem, perhaps one of the most immoral and amoral movies I've ever seen, it's just disturbing, disgusting and graphic on levels rarely reached by American cinema (Tarantino included)... on the surface.Indeed, it's impossible to give 'Old Boy' a negative review. The reason is simple, the film is amoral but it's a masterpiece of amorality, it embraces it with a sort of morbid enthusiasm whose credibility depends on its sincerity, whoever uses violence can atone with it. Yes, the film is extreme but if it wasn't, we would feel either manipulated or cheated and the film might show revenge as something necessary but never satisfactory!",10,3,5,14 March 2019
The Irishman," The stuff Scorsesian greatness is made off...
","'In the Still of the Night' is playing as the ending credits are rolling; I can't process my thoughts to express how beautiful 'The Irishman' was. True I'm a Scorsese, Pacino and De Niro fan, a gangster movie buff too but it sincerely doesn't take these predispositions to appreciate the film.Its historical value is undeniable. In fact, 'The Irishman' is a fine companion piece to movies like 'Nixon', JFK', the original 'Hoffa' of course and Scorsese's gangster biopics and you got to credit Hollywood directors like Oliver Stone and Scorsese to have enlightened us about the intricacies of the political underworld and their connections with the mob during the second half of the last century. And 'The Irishman' came to fill a few blanks about Hoffa's disappearance with a little detour through JFK's election and elements barely suggested in Hyman Roth's speech in 'The Godfather Part II' (hey, another film starring Al and Bobby).Still, 'The Irishman' is also the spiritual successor of gangster or mob-related biography classics that made Scorsese's legend, decade by decade, from 'Mean Streets' to 'Raging Bull', from 'Goodfellas' and 'Casino' to the Best Picture winner 'The Departed' in 2006 though (for me) the closest he ever came to his stylish and turbulent creativity was 'The Wolf of Wall Street'. It was a close call but Scorsese had a last trick under his sleeve for the 2010s, making a last but instant classic. And 'last' is the word and that's why I was submerged by bittersweet feelings when the film ended.Scorsese accomplished the miracle to reunite again false-acting-rivals but real-pals-in-life Pacino and De Niro, he also got Pesci here (who's extraordinary) and hell, he even got Harvey Keitel, the star of his directorial debut. There's a sense of coming full circle with 'The Irishman' as the film isn't just about but it IS the end of an era, for we might never see these actors together again. But it was worth it. No trailer, no teaser could ever do justice to how great and extremely nuanced this film is, not even that revie.. And I guess it took time for Scorsese to get back to his roots because he needed it to gain some wisdom, something subtler than maturity.Scorsese understood that style is one thing, but when we get an ordinary story but well-played and well-written characters, their arcs is the best storyteller. Still, 'The Irishman' is full of Scorsesian archetypes, the narration: less an artistic license but a necessary device to insert vital information so we keep track on who's-who, the music is full of melancholic romantic ballades and generic doo-bah songs, the editing takes us back and forth from a decade to another... and we never feel dizzy, there's just something solid and smooth in the way the story goes. And it doesn't take more than one viewing to get the big picture.The film tells the story of a hitman named Frank Sheeran, a steak truck driver who meets Russell Buffalino (Joe Pesci), and later answering phone calls starting with one of the most memorable lines of 2019, the title of Charles Brandt's original biography actually, 'I heard you paint houses' and I felt stupid not to get it before Scorsese gave the clue. The film is wise enough not to sugarcoat Frank's action, but we see him from his relationship with his mentor and father-figure played again by an extraordinary Pesci. Both are men of a few words so they choose them carefully, sometimes they elevates them to unlimited and delightful euphemistic summits, sometimes they just talk like gangsters (you know 'the thing or the other thing', 'which Tony?', the 'summer' line echoing the 'how am I funny?' scene etc.). Sure Marty has wised up, and so did we, but there's something cozy and 'enjoyable' about the film, we feel like family watching it.But if 'Mean Streets' had Johnny Boy and 'Goodfellas' Tommy De Vito, 'The Irishman' had Jimmy Hoffa. As usual with Pacino, and he's my favorite actor, it takes a while to appreciate his work, you always feel as he's at the edge of overacting a little or letting some weird reading pop up erupting, with that rapsy voice of his and his menacing eyes even when he's friendly, but no, after a few minutes, I was at ease because despite the showiness of his role (speeches, anger, monologues, intimidations), we could perceive the vulnerability behind his tough charismatic faÃ§ade, Pacino can be heartbreaking in this film.So is De Niro. His Frank is just a guy whose job has brought a sense of belonging that gave a full meaning to his life (more than his family and his daughter Peggy played by Anna Paquin), that's what we all long for, belonging and meaning. In a certain way, that's what drove Hoffa to wherever his body is, some would call it hubris: he didn't listen, his death is tragic because inevitable but also stupid because avoidable, but as Hoffa repeated, it's his union and he couldn't imagine being stepped over. Ironically what also drove these two men was friendship, Frank and 'Russ', Jimmy and Frank, but to one friendship he owed more, nothing personal, strictly business.'The Irishman' concludes on that deep and melancholic note that makes you wonder what the purpose of all this was after all, but so do many Martin's movies that starts with a glamorous and flashy observation of the mob world even (some inserted titles giving us the eventual fate of a local mobster reminded me of these boxing stats appearing in the 'Creed' film) but at the end everyone dies, with more or less natural causes and what's left are regrets, pity and sorrow... the stuff Scorsesian greatness is made off.I don't want to mix this review with Oscar considerations, I'll just use one of the film's irresistible euphemisms and hope that the Academy won't demonstrate a failure to show appreciation...",10,5,17,27 November 2019
127 Hours," Painful and thrilling experience, meaningful and inspiring story ...
","Danny Boyle's multi-layered '127 Hours' works on the three levels that make a film great in my opinion: spiritual, physical and emotional. It's a riveting experience, elevating to the extreme the notions of determination and resistance. It's a thriller, a character study, and a powerful story of courage and perseverance, even more inspiring because it's true.Despite its fairly short length, the film feels longer than that, and this is one of its main strengths. Danny Boyle's scrupulous directing creates an exhausting empathy towards Aron Ralston, the protagonist, portrayed by James Franco, in what I consider the best male performance of 2010. Empathy to the extreme as you feel like your own arm is trapped under that boulder. Free enough to move your body, having a deceptive impression of freedom, but still trapped. And when the boulder crashes on Aron's arm, his mind is clear despite the pain and so is his spirit. His self-preservation encourages him to move the boulder and never the amputation comes to his mind as an option. And, we can't imagine this cool and good looking guy will condemn himself to such a handicap. But this is because the point is still not survival. Just give him some time  and time is all we have. '127 Hours' is like a prison movie with a rock as a prison cell and a Utah canyon as a jail, in the middle of nowhere. And Aron Ralston, the loner, the young free spirited climber as the prisoner, condemned to 127 hours of painful endurance, both moral and physical.I said 'loner' but in fact, Aron is not alone, there's one second major character in this movie, inanimate but significant: the handy cam. The handy cam adds to the realism of the story, it's like the real cam of the film, not James Franco playing Aron Ralston, but Aron Ralston filming himself. Secondly, the cam is a way to convey a message that might as well be posthumous, it's his testimony. And last but not least, it plays the same role as Wilson the volleyball as the last sacred link with the rest of the world. It makes him talk, see himself like in a mirror, feeling he exists. The cam works even when it doesn't, and this is one of the most clever points of the films. We all have this strange confused feeling that we're being watched, and I don't mean paranoia. I mean when you feel you're a part of a film with an audience, you ask yourself 'what if I was watched?' and try to act as normally as possible. The movie intelligently illustrated that feeling which, as ludicrous as it may sound, is important because preventing you from insanity by trying to maintain your reason and common sense. When Aron was hallucinating, or starting to flirt with some early steps of insanity, all his memories came to life. When he was about to please his sexual organ while watching the image of a woman's breasts, he automatically restrained himself, maintaining a form of dignity as if his family or friends were really watching.Never losing it  this is Aron's physical and spiritual struggle, if his mind cracks up, if he breaks down under the pressure, his body is lost. And the body must be preserved, through an efficient symbiosis, to keep the spirit sane. Aron must drink even if it's pee while fantasizing about a fresh orange juice. And this is the point of the editing, one of the film other strengths : '127 Hours' is punctuated with entertaining montages featuring what happens inside Aron's body, when he drinks, the bubbles are like a refreshing injection of life in a suffering body, so when the water is going low  we experience the dryness in our throats. These montages work as incredible exercises of contrasts, insisting on the location, through an extraordinary cinematography that eliminates any chance of being saved by other people. Indeed, as it goes on, as we see Aron's face getting paler and thinner, while the 'others' are probably having fresh beers, fun and sex. We get deeper in the concept of loneliness, Aron got on this .... alone, and alone, he'll go through it.And this last point leads to one hell of a disturbing climax I won't even try to describe how graphic it is. But as shocked as I was, I couldn't help but cheer for the blood splattering, the bone snapping, every grunt, every shout, every tear, every move, because each one was like a victory against the adversity of an undeserved punishment. And this is why the movie is not just thrilling and entertaining, it's inspiring on a deeper level because it made me think that if I was in this case, I would have probably considered that removing this very arm that helps me to write these words, as a victory. This movie not only works in an emotional and physical level, engaging all your senses, it's also one of the most endearingly spiritual achievements of these last years. It's a redemption story of a character, guilty of a free-spirited nature that detached him from sacred bonds like Family, friends  Aron's deliberate carelessness was his flaw, the one that made a simple 'oops' omission : not telling where he was going, a fatal mistake, turning the prophecy of his ex-girlfriend :'You're gonna get so lonely' into a reality. This experience was Aron's redemption.'127 Hours' is about destiny, as I said sometimes we feel like we're watched, like living a film written by God where every fate is like a life-changing plot device. In Aron's case, reality exceeded the fiction, and Danny Boyle managed to create a powerful story about a new inspiring cinematic hero who tasted one of the most painful meanings of the word 'lonely', the 127 hours in hell was his lesson, and our inspiration.",10,1,3,26 February 2011
Batman Returns," Well done... but undone by too many villains...
","'Batman Returns' is by no means a bad movie. In terms of action, set-design, scoring and acting, there's nothing to envy from its predecessor of1989. Yet something was lacking, definitely. Whatever it was, I was so turned off that I'd rather explain why the original was so good instead.'Batman' had that Gothic atmosphere that fitted the tormented mind of Bruce Wayne, billionaire, vigilante and misfit, and the noir tone of the film fitted a city where organized crime reigned supreme; but had it been just an exercise in style and design, 'Batman' would've been poisoned by its own depressing mold, the film worked because it had an antidote, a grinning psychopath played by Jack Nicholson, a Joker who, as far as characterization went, was no joke.I said in the review of the first film that Nicholson's Joker scared me because of the way he enjoyed killing and made every homicide, an art, something fun actually. What it reveals about the performance doesn't need to be over-analyzed, you could tell Nicholson had fun playing the Joker, and that fun was communicative without making his actions any less impacting. The Joker, played by a deliberately over-the-top Nicholson was a histrionic bastard intoxicated by his own flamboyance and yet making the whole film a real macabre dance between organized crime and the Dark Knight.Keaton wasn't too present in the picture but his investigation on the Joker's action and the interludes with Kim Basinger were actually the moments we could catch our breath between two Joker's scenes. Now, to put it simply, Keaton isn't any more present in 'Batman Returns', which makes the title a bit misleading, he's even a rather tertiary character, but the villains in the film could have made his absence unnoticeable except that they were as much in need of a psychotherapy as Bruce Wayne himself. The film got too psychological and dark for its own good.There is basically one villain too many, and I guess that is Max Shreck, Christopher Walken as the evil businessman who wants to control Gotham City through electric power. He doesn't have many shining moments, except for throwing his secretary Serena Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer) out of the window once she unmasked her evil project, he does look good in an odd sexy way, but he's never as impacting a presence as Danny De Vito playing the Penguin or Pfeiffer as Catwoman, which is the height of irony since he's the actor most used to play creepy guys. You would think De Vito and Pfeiffer would spice up the film a little and 'have fun' like good old Jack, but they're actually victim of the plot's intricacy.Indeed, 'Batman Returns' feels more like an assemblage of many subplots that were certainly mouth-watering on the paper: Schrek's s plans, the penguin's quest to find his parents echoing Wayne's own trauma (he was abandoned an orphan child and was raised by penguins, living in the sewers for three decades), Serena Kyle seeking revenge against Shreck and criminals of male persuasion. There's also something interesting in the ambiguity governing the so-called villains, the Penguin wants to be loved by Gotham City community, Catwoman is a vigilante but her actions are often antagonistic to Batman, not to mention the romance growing in subtext.To make things even more complicated, you have Christmas in the backdrop, the City undergoes many assaults from the Red Circus Triangle, and many love or hate triangles from one character to another make the plot quickly derail. The original 'Batman' had one villain, not the subtlest plot but that was enough, by trying to make many antagonists and make them as three-dimensional as possible, the film went in too many directions, creating a Rubik-cube of a plot, without the colors to make the final result look good.Indeed, each of these stories, was depressing as hell, there was something fun in Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman but like the Penguin, like Bruce Wayne, they were characters turned to the past, to the initial struggles of their human counterpart while the Joker was from any trauma. The only villain with a focus on the future was Schreck but he could only be underused, and so was Batman.In the end, you have a Christmas movie whose action sequence provided nothing new once you enjoyed the original but whose tone is so dark and depressing you might enjoy the film for the actors, the atmosphere, but you wouldn't think of watching it again.",6,5,11,30 July 2017
Finding Nemo," 19 999 leagues under the sea... and a league of its own...
","Disney movies have provided a fair share of lachrymose moments ever since Snow White's funeral, but in seven decades, two movies reached the trauma-inducing level: 'Bambi' and 'The Lion King' (no need to remind why). But while it took half a century to provide the second shocker, it was only one year shy away from a decade that the third one came, through the unsettling (yet powerful) opening of 'Finding Nemo'.The film starts with a clown-fish couple, Marlin (Albert Brooks) and Coral, they lovingly contemplate their new nest of love in the Great Barrier Reef where hundreds of little eggs are peacefully 'sleeping'. The heart-warming sight distracts us from the ominous arrival of a barracuda. And once Marlin realizes that the Reef is suddenly empty, you know whatever is coming will not be 'Fish Police' material, not even 'The Little Mermaid'. Thankfully (so to speak) the scene is shot in 'subjective camera', Marlin is knocked out and after a brief blackout, the previously colorful and magnificent-looking Ocean from the opening credits turns into a devastatingly silent mortuary.Marlin lost his eggs but one, a little reddish bowl still beating from inside, a minuscule yet so priceless light of hope. Marlin calls the fish Nemo as the instant homage to his deceased wife who happened to like the name.You see, the mark of great movies is that you can tell from the first five minutes that you're onto something special. 'Finding Nemo' left me no doubt that I was going to watch a something very special. I compared the opening to the deaths in 'Bambi' and 'The Lion King' but these were middle-plot points, establishing a necessary evolution in the main characters. In 'Finding Nemo', the tragedy is the set-up, it cements the unconditional love between Marlin and his son, which is what the film is primarily about. Indeed, for all the dazzling visuals and the infinite waves of blue the movie bless our sights with, it's all in the father-and-son relationship.We might dislike over-protective parents, they act ridiculously and embarrass their children when they try to impress their schoolmates, but how can anyone blame Marlin after that first scene, especially since Nemo (because of his egg's fall) has a diminutive fin. Still, the merit of the script is to make us understand Nemo's actions as well, when he sneaks away during a school field trip to get close to a boat, we know it's not to prove something to his friends but just a sign of exasperation addressed to his father. When he's suddenly captured by a scuba diver, he immediately calls Marlin for his help and we can only witness Marlin's desperation and determination to find his little one.The adventure takes off, and takes us from one visual delight to a thrilling encounter. I never felt as hypnotically entranced by the sight of the undersea world on a screen since the days I played 'Donkey Kong Country' (don't laugh, if you were a fan of the game, you'd understand). This is computer-generated imagery at its finest, using lights and colors in a way that floats between reality and imagery, when a school of moon-fish form a sad-faced Marlin, you know the animators don't let themselves enslaved by realism and when a tiny fishy reveals to be a giant whale, it's a creative twist on the 'are you short or far away?' gag. No visual trick is spared for the sake of a great moment, and it goes as far as allowing us to explore the human world, from the fish' perspective.Poor Nemo finds himself in a dentist fish tank whose occupants, lead by Gill, a Moorish idol voiced by Willem Defoe, try to pull a 'Great Escape'. Oddly enough, it was the tank, not the ocean that inspired Andrew Stanton the idea of Nemo. As a kid, he saw the same ones at the dentist and assumed they tried to escape. When he discovered the clown-fish species, and their reluctance to live an anemone, he found the perfect material for a thrilling and emotional adventure.Still, given the emotional resonance of the plot, he made it a perfect vehicle for comedy; the dentist gags and the goofiness of the seagulls never fails to inspire a few chuckles, the groovy turtles, the vegetarian sharks whose leader is conveniently named Bruce steal the show, but the greatest thing about 'Finding Nemo', as far as laughs go, is the creation of Dory. With Marlin and Nemo, she's the third guy on the podium, an adorable regal blue tang fish suffering from short-term memory loss. The writers always find a way to make her condition funny, critical and sad when seriousness is required, and her tandem with killjoy Marlin saved the film from being a 'Bambi' in the water.And the fourth star is obviously the ocean, rendered with a majesty that outdates 'The Little Mermaid' and 8 years after 'Toy Story', 'Finding Nemo' showed how far Disney magic can go, it's like water has always been part of Disney's milestones ever since Mickey's 'Steamboat Willie'. And the story has such a richness of its own, that it needed two climactic sequences, one involving the fish tank and incarnating the human stupidity at its finest through the character of a fish-torturing girl named Darla and a more dramatic one set in fishing grounds where the mass school of grouper try to get off a net. At the end of this powerful journey, both Marlin and Nemo learned a few lessons about their relationship.'Finding Nemo' is the stuff great animated movies are made of: magnificent visuals, a powerful story and comedy with the jolly Dory. The film was the most recent inclusion in AFI's Top 10 animated movies and once you see it, it's hard to argue. 'Dreamworks' tried with 'A Shark Tale', but it couldn't play in the same league than one film that swims 20 000 leagues above.",10,0,0,17 July 2017
Superbad," As Mel Brooks said about 'The Producers', the film rises below vulgarity...
","'Superbad' is a teen-comedy overloaded with all the raunchiness and naughty humor you'd expect in the chronological vicinity than 'American Pie' and those youth movies that pululated in the early 2000s (overlapping with straight horror through 'Final Destination' or comedic with 'Scary Movie'). And yet it managed to rise itself above the usual farces that have no pretension to go beyond their demographic target and provide something as funny as a parody, but smarter. In fact, it is parodic in the way it subverts many tropes of 'wild nights' films à la Richard Linklater's 'Dazed and Confused' but without betraying a spirit that makes fun of kids while respecting and forgiving them.Take a scene like the 'McLovin' fake ID, which can easily be regarded as one of the top 20 most emblematic 2000s movie moments: that scene's not funny alone because it turns a common teen-situation into something of a sitcom level (though the Hawaiian organ donor with a unique name à la 'Seal' is really something) but it's funny because it's played straight by the three characters. Fogell aka McLovin (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) sticks to his guns and even rationalizes the second name option. Seth (Jonah Hill) is shocked by Fogell's obliviousness and expresses it with loud angry tirades full of F-bombs. Evan (Michael Cera) is the voice of reason but even his words fail to flap Fogell's confidence of his genius.Any lesser comedy would have made the 'McLovin' thing a revelation, but Greg Mottola's film makes the situation work on three levels: it's the set-up, the joke and the punchline that provokes the intervention of the two cops (Seth Rogen who wrote the film and Bill Hader) and enhances the film's hilarity with two unexpected additions. The incident also sets up the whole chain of events that will make Seth and Evan believe their friend has been arrested so they could go find another way to get the booze. Evan is by the way the name of Rogen's co-writer Goldberg and the story was based on their teen memories. And what they created was a fun comedy where the booze will matter less than the journey during which Seth and Evan will settle a few records and discuss the limits of their co-dependent friendship (and a few other things).Meanwhile, it's Fogell/McLovin who has the time of his life with the two cops whose intervention will awake their youth memories, and the result is a gag-driven night with a few interesting insights about the social function of partying, especially if we talk of the last night before school is off. To some degree, 'Superbad' can be regarded as a fine and clever mix between 'last night' classic 'Dazed and Confused' and the first 'American Pie' which was also about boys aiming to lose their virginity before getting to university, which (let's face it) was one of the big issues of a young male in his early adulthood.The comparison with 'American Pie' is even more relevant because the film doesn't make fun of girls, though it portrays them as a sort of vehicles to fulfill guy's fantasies. Still, it's obvious from the start that the misconception of girls denounces the boys lack of maturity. But if that's played straight by Seth, the character of Evan provides a fine subversion because he does have a crush on a girl but doesn't rely on alcohol to get her. Seth's crush Jules (Emma Stone) also corrects his conception by mentioning she doesn't need intoxicationd and she might think of sex if the partner isn't inebriated. Let that be a lesson to immature shy boys who needs social fuel and given the recent 'date rapes' scandals, the angle taken by 'Superbad' proves not only to be insightful and respectful but also salutary for the film's legacy.Indeed, whether you think you need to be drunk to get the girl or that she should be drunk, 'Superbad' does come with respectful answers that tie every element of the plot together without putting girls on a symbolic pedestal either, they can have as much immaturity and insecurity as their fellow guys. It also shows a strong friendship being undermined by two existential issues when we say goodbye to the teenage years: girls and studies. The director handles the script with a sharp but tender eye, he seems to go for the over-the-top raunchy comedy at times but'Superbad' ends up being as sweet and heart-warming as 'The 40-Year Old Virgin'. It is really a high point in teen comedies, that allowed two actors to bloom: two-time Oscar-nominee Jonah Hill and three-time nominee and Oscar-winner Emma Stone. That's how old the film is; and how better it'll get with time, like a good wine or a Goldslick Vodka.And the cast looks all like teenagers despite being in their early 20s (except for McLovin) and once again, a bad comedy might have cast Seth Rogen in the titular role, the film didn't fall in that trap.Now, the film refreshed many memories that I have already mentioned them in 'Lady Bird', I laughed loud at the obvious gags but also for subtle moment like like the market vendor, and subtle moments like the vest or when Seth puts on Evan's father clothes, because I'm guilty of having used adult clothes and even a vest to look more adult. As for the obsession with 'losing it' or the misconception of alcohol as a romantic tool, I'm glad a film took that up to eleven, showing that there's not much equity between boys and girls on that level. And it's only fair to have a few laughs about that.And the film is funny, over-the-top and its satisfying coming-of-age ending makes up for the bits of naughtiness. And the ending drawing montage is the icing of the cake, showing the writing talent of Rogen and Goldberg, who raises a monument of vulgarity and bad taste to a high level of fun, like Mel Brooks with 'The Producers'.",8,1,1,15 March 2020
Creed," The come-back story that caught everyone off-guard, including the fans...
","Rocky saying goodbye to a cheerful crowd in Vegas with Paulie and Robert, and then visiting Adrian's grave with an emotional 'Yo Adrian, we did it!' was the perfect ending. And the father- to-son speech provided one of the most inspirational quotes of the 21st Century : 'It ain't about how hard you hit, but how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward', and the perfect testimonial quote for Rocky Balboa.So, just when we thought that Sylvester Stallone came full circle with his fetish character, Ryan Coggler, a director not even born when 'Rocky IV' came out, pulled him back in the ring. Even the fans, even Sly, were perplex, so imagine those who associate him to mumbling action heroes or the Razzies' eternal punching bag. But I guess 'it ain't over till it's over' and Coggler thought there was more to do with Rocky, and he found a perfect spot to dig into: Apollo Creed, an American icon by himself and not just for the 'stars and stripes' short but for his significant part to the Rocky's narrative. So fitting that he'd inspire one of the best of the series again. The idea of an illegitimate son was very smart: a character totally independent from the previous material yet deeply rooted in it. So the film wasn't (another) sequel, it was a spin-off, a first curiosity-grabbing nuance. And 'Creed''s interest never diminished ever since the talk started. And before Thanksgiving (40 years after the fictional start of the series), something magical happened: the words 'Stallone' and 'Oscar' were mentioned in the same titles, and it wasn't about the 1991 movie, and the 'Awards' referred to hadn't 'Razzie' written before. No one saw that coming. But after the first rave reviews, I was on an edge, nervously following the awards nominations and wins until the Oscar one, a huge victory by itself. And this is a richly deserved nomination, so is the Golden Globe win, definitely not a veteran making his come-back in a year driven by a wave of 70's nostalgia (with 'Mad Max: Fury Road' and 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens'), this is a rich and heartfelt performance that hits a sensitive chord whether you love the series or not. Even as a fan of Rocky Balboa, I forgot how gentle and sweet he is, beyond the whole underdog appeal. His innocence made him such an enduring and endearing character, sticking to his philosophy of life, no matter how bad the news are, and even the mistakes he makes are forgivable because made out of well-meaning intentions. The one mistake he made was not to stop Apollo during the Drago match, but he respected Apollo's stubbornness. So, when Creed's son insists on having him as a coach, Rocky sees that the boy is hungry. I know I make it sound as if it was a Stallone film (which it is, after all) but the merit goes to Michael B. Jordan who plays Adonis Creed with such confidence that we don't necessarily root for him at the start, he has a sort of cocky arrogance which is the trademark of his father (and the cause of his demise) yet his eyes betray some vulnerability begging to be vented sometime. When he finally lets it out, we understand the pain Creed's illegitimate son went through.This is the irony of living in the shadow of a reputation, same problem for Rocky's son except that Adonis inherited the same gift and passion. His name is both a blessing and a burden, and it's up to him to find the right balance. His goal is honorable: to make a name by himself by earning each cheer without 'Creed' playing a part of it, but who's he kidding? Isn't he having Rocky Balboa as a coach? He's a mountain of contradictions, which is the mark of complex and appealing characters. And his partnership with Rocky inevitably reminds of the fatherly friendship between Rocky and Mickey. Coincidentally, Stallone is nominated for playing Mickey's role, and by being nominated a second time for the same character, Stallone joins an 'elite Oscar' club counting such prestigious names as Pacino, Blanchett, Crosby, Newman and O'Toole.Oscar trivia put aside, this proves Rocky doesn't belong to Stallone anymore, his legacy is bigger than that for 40 years, not a single decade didn't have a 'Rocky', it started with the gritty post-Nixon 70's, then the flamboyant Reagan era, the low-key 90's, 2000's and now technological 2010's, with a new generation of actors: Michael B. Jordan, Tessa Thompson. The series has a timeless appeal and always has something to offer, if only, a powerful emotional performance that took everyone off-guard. Whether he wins or loses, Stallone has already gone the distance, embracing, once again, the spirit of his creation. He might have done his share of stinkers, but hey, who can claim to have created a cinematic icon?.As for the film, If not totally flawless, and not deprived from one or two awkward or a little over-stylized moments, the emotionality is intact, And Rocky's spirit is there. And Stallone is as emotional as in 'Rocky Balboa'', but in a more restrained and subtle manner, you could tell Sly let himself being directed for the first time, for playing his 'baby' character, and it's truly a new Stallone that shines on screen. Jordan, Thomson and Philycia Rashad, who plays Mary Ann Creed, were so great, I'm looking forward to seeing them in other projects. Should that be 'Creed II'? Should they push their luck? Should Sly retire now in a blaze of glory? I sincerely don't know, there are many plot points left unsolved and that can work as a great material for a sequel but for the moment, let's just appreciate the great achievement 'Creed' is, and how it doubled the excitement of the Awards season by including the ultimate underdog actor, Sylvester Stallone.",9,7,11,18 January 2016
The Great Dictator," Probably the most important and defining film of the XXth Century ...
","Both were born in the 'Old Continent', some days apart in April 1889, both had vaguely similar features incarnated by their memorable toothbrush mustaches  more importantly, both would become the most famous men of their era: Charlie Chaplin and Adolf Hitler, international stars for the better and for the worse, in the twilight of 1939.Despite their similar backgrounds, the two men represent the opposite poles of humanity. One dedicated his life for silent comedy as a universal language meant to inspire the purest and most human emotions, while the other turned the country of Kant into a supremacist nation, justifying such atrocities as invasions, mass murders and ultimately, genocide. Chaplin was a man of emotions, Hitler of a rationalism whose meaning was twisted until it became synonym of bestial superiority: the law of the strongest, or mechanical thinking, through the dedication to technology in total contempt for the emotions that resonate for Nazis as the language of the weak. 'The Great Dictator' is Chaplin's answer to this absurdity, a message that speaks for Humanity: universal, inspirational  and hilarious.One scene incarnates the universality of silent comedy, the 'globe ballet', illustrating with a poetic finesse, the devastating ambitions and the madness inherent not just to Hynkel, but to all the dictators in the world, the balloon popping at the end is the prophetic reminder that justice triumphs sooner or later. The whole film contains many classic Chaplin moments including the iconic shaving with Brahms's Hungarian Violins reminding how Nazism dishonored the beautiful heritage of its civilization, other scenes include the confrontation between Hynkel and Napolini, the dictation, and the inflamed speech in German-sounding gibberish. In 'City Lights', Chaplin used gibberish to humorously denounce sound's futility, in 'The Great Dictator', Hynkel's gibberish sounds like barks reminding what Hitler's voices incarnated to the oppressed people, something inhuman, hateful, violent ... still, better to be mocked than wept over.Chaplin's treatment, more than in any of his films, tackles a difficult subject with the perfect mix of comedy and drama, incarnated by Hannah, Paulette Goddard whose illuminating beauty represents the driving force of the film, as the eternal dream on a brighter tomorrow, as the virginal wound in people's devastated hearts. Never losing faith in humanity, Hannah epitomizes Anne Franck's famous 'In spite of everything I still believe that people are really good at heart' The tender relationship with the Jewish barber demonstrates the evilness of an ideology that prevented people from the simplest things, simply from being human. In the 'coin in the pudding' scene, one of the funniest, we realize that despite all the noblest feelings, the men from the ghetto are just ordinary guys who don't necessarily want to be heroes, a subtle but no less clever depiction of Jewish humor, subtle mix of wit and self-derision.Chaplin said that if he'd known the extent of the atrocities committed by the Nazi, he couldn't have made fun of it. This is a honest and admirable recognition of the value of comedy, it's not a weapon but it attacks, not rational but it makes you think, whatever takes itself too seriously is put in its place and whatever is mocked by the majority gets an extra level of depth and poignancy. This is probably why Chaplin was uneasy with the gap between Hynkel and the 'original' dictator who forever marked the course of history, the comedy is still innocent enough to be regarded as an answer to Nazism's horrific barbarity. Which might explain why a few films made fun of Hitler after 'The Great Dictator' and why most of the comedic takes on Hitler were from Jewish directors, as if one had to carry the wound of the tragedy to translate it into laughs, as a posthumous attempt to strike back against the evil, humor as a defensive, almost cathartic, process  I guess.I also guess Chaplin believed in that and unconsciously saw himself as one of the oppressed people, whether they were Jewish or Gentle, Black or White, he saw himself as part of humanity. And this is where the universality of 'The Little Tramp' relies on, he's the 'Little Fellow' who speaks for all the little fellows in the world, with thrilling words expressing the very principles Chaplin stood for: kindness, love, brotherhood, happiness, universality. It's not the Jewish barber but Chaplin himself delivering the most beautiful and intelligently inspirational message transcending the bounds of Cinema. Chaplin who never spoke, finally let out all his emotions, beliefs and feelings, so important that the fact that he was out of the character, wasn't relevant. The climactic speech rejects the barbarity of Nazism, fascism, any ugly word ending with -ism, rejects machinery that became synonym of alienation and destruction as foreshadowed in his previous 'Modern Times', and accepts technology only as an instrument to unite people, to strengthen human spirit, solidarity, empathy. Not Tomania, or Bacteria, Chaplin, spoke from the bottom of his heart, a place named Utopia, a beautiful dream, we tend to reach every day. Like a true prophet of his era, Chaplin, ahead of his time, points the danger of Nazism. The applauds at the end indirectly highlights the fantastic aspect of the film, released in 1940 when the worst was to come.But Chaplin made his point and the film works as fantasy with the last metamorphosis of a character, proving that justice can triumph over fanaticism and while other film-makers imagined cold-blooded killers machine-gunning Adolf Hitler with an orgasmic satisfaction, Chaplin appeals to humanity, asks people to think as one indivisible brotherhood, no nations, no frontiers, no use of malicious technologies, only kindness and humble intelligence to put wings in human souls so they can fly to rainbows of hope.Not just Chaplin's ultimate masterpiece, 'The Great Dictator' is one of the most humanistic cinematic message that never lost its resonance, not even after 70 years. Thank you, Mr. Chaplin!",10,1,2,19 September 2011
The Natural," Well, Mr. Redford has done it, the New York Knights have won it...
","It all starts with the idyllic postcard-picture of an Iowa or a Nebraska farm, a kid named Roy Hobbs is playing baseball with Daddy, he pitches the ball in the same spot drawn by his father, he's a natural we get it, but that's not enough. I thought what was missing was something from the heart: guts or determination, how wrong I was: it's all about the elements. The lightning struck the mighty oak tree under which his father collapsed to death, splitting it in two (the tree, not the father) then Roy took a piece of wood and carved it out into a baseball bat, calling it 'Wonderboy' with a lightning bolt Ã  la AC/DC, at that moment, I kept hearing that name being whispered in my head: Home...r... no, not home-run but Homer like Homer Simpson.The 'Wonderboy' sequence inspired the first act of the legendary 'Homer at the Bat', the one that started the Golden Age, and the music was used in another episode where Homer fulfilled one of his lifelong dreams by scoring a perfect 300 at the bowling game. Yes, there's something magical about that story and that Randy Newman's triumphant Wagnerian score, something that inspired the highest point of the life of all American hero: Homer. There's a catch though (no pun intended), 'The Simpsons' is made for laughs. I'm not too sure bout 'The Natural', Barry Levinson's adaptation of Bernard Malamud's 1952 novel of the same name.In many aspects, the film is similar to 'Field of Dreams' and I must applaud its daringness. it embraces a sort of metaphysical vision of base-ball, revisiting America's favorite pastime through an almost mythological hero, a man with a gift for baseball and for troubles in the same time, a man whose aura carries some fantasy chosen-one element and yet for some reason, never seems to get even with Karma. Indeed, when we first see him at 19, striking the Babe-Ruth lookalike Whammer (Joe Don Baker) out on three pitches, it's like nothing can stop him, except maybe a silver bullet, cutting through his stomach and his promising career. I was caught off-guard by that moment and I thought the film had succeeded in its opening part... though it asks us a lot in terms of suspension of disbelief to make a 48-year old Redford pass for a young man, and it doesn't get better after.For instance, when 16 year after the incident, he's hired to play for the New York Knights, the coach Pop (Wilford Brimley) never gives him a chance to show his talent and keeps him on the bench all the time. Granted he's the boss but when your club is sitting in last place, what can you lose? Roy could have pitched himself (so to speak), told the Whammer story, but no, we have to wait for the right moment so he can knock the cover off the baseball. Yes, it's spectacular, it's rewarding to some degree, but that's the film's problem: it always waits for the convenient moment, and even when it is effective and overwhelming but there's something a bit artificial about the pacing, and maybe worse, the characterization.Robert Redford is heaven to look at and I'm straight like an 'I' but Ebert is right in his assumption that the film is more enamored with the figure of Hobbs and his glowing blondish halo than it is with baseball, it's never Hobbs who's instrumental to the beauty of the sport but rather the opposite. And everyone around Hobbs is corrupt and malicious to a degree it gets ridiculous, the manager (Robert Prosky) uses bets against his own team (has anyone learned the lesson from 1919?), a beautiful woman (Kim Basinger) sees the best interests for her in a relationship with Hobbs and so does a manipulative bookie (Darren McGavin), and finally a cynical journalist (Robert Duvall) makes or breaks careers without any scruple as long as it makes good money.In that microcosm, where the odds and the Gods are against him, Hobbs can only count on a few supporters: Farnsworth as the bench coach with a benevolent smile, Glenn Close as his sweetheart and lady-in-white Iris with a mysterious angel-like aura, enough to earn her an Oscar nomination, and don't get me started on the constantly smiling bat boy who looks like a picture you'd find in a peanut butter jar smile, that kid almost gave me ulcers. So for all its love letter to baseball, the bad guys have absolutely no redeeming qualities, the good guys believe in Hobbs in some saintly way, they're all as two-dimensional as an ad poster, and in that flood of good sentiment, somewhat I wished baseball could find a way and provide something a more intellectually challenging.I read that the original novel was darker and had a more complex ending but 'The Natural' seems to follow Hobbs' journey without even caring to explain anything. And many things do happen for no specific reason, there's a character played by Michael Madsen as star outfielder whose exit comes totally out of nowhere so I was wondering whether it was to be taken humorously or not, but of the many points that compromises the film's enjoyment and credibility, the worst is perhaps the ending. Say what you want, the deal was clear between Hobbs' choice to play... and the alternative and the final shot made me wonder if it was intended as a fantasy or reality, in both ways, it was a spectacular concession for fireworks but a bad move that contradicted the film's message. If there ever was.",6,0,1,11 October 2019
The Others," 'They're here' ... and so are they ...
","In a nutshell, Alejandro Amenabar's 'The Others' is a gripping and emotionally powerful horror film, respecting our intelligence enough not to overuse graphic elements and to make the perfect dosage between thrills and mystery. And the mystery surrounding the characters is so absorbing that it immediately plunges us into such an unnerving and harrowing atmosphere that at the end of the film, whether we found relief or our hearts were still pounding, we know we'd just have lived an extraordinary experience.'The Others' is set in a large mansion inhabited by a young mother, Nicole Kidman as Grace Stewart and her two children, Anne and Nicholas. The film opens when she receives three applicants for house jobs, an elderly tacit grounds-keeper named Mr Turkle, a deaf and dumb adolescent, and the lady who seems to lead the group, Bertha Mills, played, in a remarkable performance, by Fionula Fllanigan. Mrs Mills is the kind of character that immediately strikes the viewer as very competent in her job while the eventuality of her vileness is better conveyed by the peculiarity of her workmates. what's more, Mrs Mills' personality, very calm and professional, efficiently contrasts with Grace's more natural behavior as a loving and caring mother, trying to hide her excitability behind a mask of aristocratic-like composure.It's hard to figure the period of the film until Grace mentions that her husband is fighting in Europe: it's WWII, the film is set in a mysterious foggy island in Britain, and we ought to believe her. Now, why would the mother of two kids endure such a spooky location? the answer is immediately given, setting at the same time, the tone of the film. Her two kids suffer an extremely rare syndrome, they are photosensitive, which means they can't be exposed to sunlight without being victims of irremediable symptoms. Therefore the mansion's activity is driven by a special but indispensable routine implying to close all the doors with a key, whenever someone gets in or out. This information is vital, and plays as an interesting display of smart writing in the way it distracts us from many precocious interrogations, such as why are all the three servants dressed in a very old-fashion way.I mentioned in the early paragraph the atmosphere of the film and, no pun intended, it's indeed the key element that drives the film. The atmosphere is so intense that we don't need to be scared, because we constantly keep our guard up, it's the kind of situations so calm we know something will happen. Yet everything remains desperately quiet, and as the movie progresses, all we have are little doses of thrills, through apparitions, voices, screams, encounters with mysterious presences, and the macabre discovery of photographs showing dead people, but no death, no gore, no fights. The secret of 'The Others' is to works as an efficient set-up whose sensational impact would ineivtably rely on the climax, so all we have to do is to be patient, and collect all the hints in order to know what to expect and this is what communicates the thrilling effect of the filmThe atmosphere is carried by a shadowy external photography and a powerful cinematography whose use of lights transforms the vastness of a mansion into a sum of little closed places, conveying the disturbing feeling of a suffocating paranoia. The house is so big yet feels so small while the mysterious and haunting presence of 'strangers' make the whole setting totally unsettling. And the force of the film is within the story as it features characters who are apparently forced to live in this mansion for vital reasons, and the satisfying resolution would either be a way to chase the others, or to be chased, but we all know the confrontation is inevitable. 'The Others'' suspense works on a Hitchcockian level, even more effective because we really don't know what to expect, and take it from someone who saw it each time with different persons, no one ever guesses the ending, and neither did I.But it would be unfair and untrue to imply that 'The Others' only works thanks to the ending, the narrative evolves around an emotional core within the story of a mother who tries to protect her two children. And the conflict in 'The Others' is not just between two different kinds of presences in a same house, but the psychological consequence through the torment invading the heart of a woman, torn between her maternal instinct and a terrible secret belonging to the past and profoundly affecting the present. Nicole Kidman magnificently embodies the vulnerability of a woman left alone and totally alienated by too much responsibility. And Mrs Mills represents the perfect counterpart to Grace's hellish condition and while she gets closer to Anne, and Grace's behavior becomes more suspicious, the notion of vileness goes back and forth and we wait until the moment it will finally determine who the real antagonist is Â… if there ever is one.All in all, it's hard to know who is the straight person of this series of incidents when emotions are so powerfully engaged. 'The Others' is a remarkable chronicle of a dramatic family story involving a woman and two kids, one strong-minded and free-spirited little girl and her poignantly coward little brother. The two kids, beautifully portrayed, mirror the same contrasts between Mrs Mills and Grace Stewart and what's more, their condition plays like the metaphor of Grace's symbolic sensitivity to an even blinding and painful light. Needless to say that the ending doesn't disappoint and elevates the films to one of the greatest horror mystery thrillers of the last 20 years, working in every single level.So beware of the light, whether it's of a blinding sunshine or a terrible secret",9,4,5,26 February 2012
Dead Poets Society," Teach them the passion of learning,not the learning of passion ...
","The first time I saw 'Dead Poets Society' at 16, I liked it BUT my appreciation was undermined by the fact that many high school teachers were screening this and 'Good Will Hunting' to us. I guess their pedagogic value didn't leave them indifferent, nor the inspirational message about learning to think by ourselves, and to forge well-made rather than well-filled heads. Now I'm almost thirty, I saw the film several times, I read Roger Ebert's infamous review, I went to prep school, then a prestigious business school, I had my share of dreams and conflicts with my father, enough to build a second and more constructive opinion.On the surface, 'Dead Poets Society' ticks all the boxes of the great film begging for a Best Picture nomination, the impressive direction, the dazzling cinematography, the inspirational score, the sober setting, the supporting characters implying numerous subplots enriching the story and on the top of that: the inspirational message lying beneath an endearing script, full of poetry and an intelligent hymn to the extraordinary value of life. 'Dead Poets Society' is a remarkable cinematic achievement BUT isn't life too complex a concept to be only defined by the duality of oppression/repression, conservatism/freedom. Are we either free- spirited or close-minded? Peter Weir can't prevent the script from falling into inexcusably manipulative clichés. The movie sins by oversimplification, when it could have developed a more human and realistic approach instead of the whole hysteria that invokes romantic poetry as a dream builder. On that level, I've always had a problem with Neil's suicide. I couldn't put my finger why, until I had an important discussion with my father. I revealed that everything I did was out of fear of disappointing him. He invested a lot of hopes for my future, but in the end, I was unhappy, and wished I could fulfill my personal, artistic dreams. I will never forget his answer. It was my entire fault, and I was just so lazy I couldn't do something on my own. I waited for a support when I could at least give a try and present him with a fait accompli. He was right, all I did was comforting my thinking with the fallacious idea that I would never make my dreams true as long as he disapproved. Parents are notorious for being the first dream-killers, but believing it's an insurmountable obstacle is the sign of a level of immaturity so high, that any anti-conformism would fatally lead to irresponsible decisions anyway.Neil had choices. By leaving the house, he would have tried to live by himself, to become an adult. Through an existential impulse, as the most authentic illustration of the 'Carpe Diem' motto, instead of killing himself; he would have symbolically killed his father, and become a man... OR ...he could have considered the possibility to study theater in Harvard. Neil acted out of cowardice, starting by a lie that would have naturally upset his domineering father. The suicide killed the very purpose of the film, by trying to point an accusing finger on an oppressive system, responsible of Neil's act while the mise en scene was so overdone that it failed to show it as an act of despair.This Manichean approach falls in lamentably formulaic plot devices, in order to make Keating the scapegoat of a fascist system, while Neil is the only one to blame. Or, for that matter, the writer, who probably thought that 'death' is so cinematically impacting, it's the only way to solve a problem, while it's pure opportunistic dramatization.Anyway, Neil was the leader of the group : with his death, all the wannabe-poets were reduced to a bunch of recycled stereotypes, illustrating the worst influence an anti-establishment mind can have on spoiled rich kids with the right predispositions for pseudo rebellion. The most outrageous, yet realistic one is the use of poetry to impress and seduce girls. At least, one was sincere in his Don Juan role, while the other could have been more responsible and respect the fact that the girl he wanted was with another boy. Anyway, the romantic subplot was dull and predictable and reduced poetry to a bunch of slogans made up to 'get the girl'. I had a guy in high school who published poems dedicated to some classmates (all girls naturally) and they were all meowing over how sweet it was. As a poem writer myself, I couldn't help but question the motivation behind these writings.(I won't go further with the other characters, one was labeled as the official villain, with no redeeming quality, and the two nerdy guys played the comic relief part, I liked it when they danced rock'n'roll but who the hell were these two guys fencing outside ?)Poetry as seduction or poetry as therapy to overcome a sickly shyness, in the content, the whole course of Mr. Keating is a show, where the students love more the teacher than poetry. In prep school, I will never forget my math teacher who was a tyrant, she made me so nervous I felt I would nauseate sometimes. But ultimately, I remember her as one of the greatest teachers I ever had. 'Dead Poets Society' starts with the wrong step by showing a professor already popular, when the greatest achievement is to go against the naturally pointless rebellious attitude of student. Teach them the passion for learning not the learning of passion.Besides, some of the greatest artistic uvres were made during oppressive times, that let the very best of human soul translate its angst, its passion in an explosion of creativity ... and one must experience prison to dream of escape.",6,1,2,25 October 2011
Brokeback Mountain," We all have a 'Brokeback Mountain'...
","In summer 1963, two young cowboys, Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhall) are hired by Joe Aguirre (Randy Quaid) to herd his sheep through Wyoming Mountains. Ennis is introverted and laconic, Jack lively and romantic. In the midst of their mission, they discover mutual love somewhere in Brokeback Mountain.The bond is tacit first, but culminates on a cold night where they have sex, in a violent yet passionate way. The day after, they decide to let the matter rest. What happened in Brokeback stays in Brokeback. Yet they can't fool their feelings. Each one follows his path, gets married, has children, but when they meet again a few years after, the joy is so overwhelming they surrender to an urgent desire to kiss each other, perhaps the most desperately passionate of recent movies' history. Then they decide to go 'fishing' in the setting of their previous isolated passion, marking the start of a two-decade secretive relationship. Brokeback becomes the kind of destination inviting you, for once in a lifetime, to be true to yourself. To a certain degree, we all have a Brokeback Mountain.It wasn't my intent to introduce this review with the dull cliché about a place being less a geographical location than a 'state of mind' but this time, it's essential to establish from the start what the film is not: a 'gay cowboy movie', it does feature a love story between two cowboys but the focus isn't on their forbidden relationship. Of course, a homosexual romance in the Midwest or in Texas wasn't the most cheerfully welcomed thing in the 60's and 70's, but Ang Lee isn't interested in the 'message', this is not a film supposed to open your eyes on homophobia, but just to show how the lives of two persons are profoundly affected by a crucial choice they have made early in their youth: renouncing to their happiness because of social pressure, and affecting in the process other people's lives. The film is full of bad but understandable decisions like life I guess. Life indeed, that's what earns this film its universal appeal, had it focused on homophobia then the two cowboys would have inspired sympathy but not the right one, as victims, we would have true feelings but not strong enough to transcend the 'gay' context. The merit of the Oscar- winning script, written by Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana was to create a story where the real suffering was actually self-inflicted. It's all in their renouncement, the fact that these two men, after having what they think is an unfortunate roar of passion, decide to go back to 'normal' lives, and resign to lives that weren't theirs. These are average blue-collar unambitious guys, why should they even dream of happiness after all? But they realize they simply condemned themselves to hell because they regularly have a taste of the very happiness they're missing.Watching the film, I had the feeling I was looking at my own condition, and I thought to myself, anyone who ever renounced a dream to follow the other sheep (I wonder if the imagery was deliberate) until realizing a few years after that he screwed everything, will relate to the story. And reading Roger Ebert's review, I appreciated that he spotted the same thing : 'I can imagine someone weeping at this film, identifying with it, because he always wanted to stay in the Marines, or be an artist or a cabinetmaker.' Count me in the 'artist' category. Through the story of these two cowboys spending their all lives lying to people they love and to themselves, while movies exhilarate the acquaintances with destiny, this one hits a universally sensitive chord because it's about wasted lives.Annie Proulx' wrote a short story that could hardly fit in a film's format, and that inspired the screenwriters the idea to expand the romance over the limits of Brokeback. And that's the element that elevated the film, because from the forbidden relationship between Ennis and Heath, we also see how it profoundly affects the lives of their wives, especially Alma (Michelle Williams) who witnesses the passionate kiss and confronts Ennis about his so-called fishing trips where he came back without fishes, many years later, we can feel the pain of betrayal. A similar scene occurs with a waitress played by Linda Cardellini, who genuinely falls in love with Ennis ignoring what he had inside. Ennis and Jack aren't victims, and they don't enjoy hurting people, but the film makes the right choice of embodying the laconic personality of Ennis and the confusion of Jack, so we can feel their unhappiness from very subtle and silent moments. Indeed, seeing them in their ordinary lives highlight what is truly missing and that's how 'Brokeback Mountain' displays an astonishing maturity with a relatively simple plot, there's no message, no political statement, it's all in the unseen and unspoken. Although there are a few heartbreaking moments where you have lines that say it all, the most haunting being 'I wish I knew how to quit you' or when Ennis mentions the memory of his father showing them the corpse of a dead gay cowboy (killed in the most atrocious way), we know it's both an explanation for his tacit nature but maybe an omen for a tragic ending. But this is a credit to the screenwriters to have let a magnificent love story unfold and surprise those who expected the 'gay romance'; the film isn't about homosexuality, but a love that happens to be between men. The script waited for years before being adapted, known as the greatest non-adapted script, as if it waited for the right director. Ang Lee managed to provide some depth and heart in the film rightfully winning an Oscar for his sensitive directing. The talent of Jake Gyllenhall and the late Heath Ledger doing the rest",10,3,6,11 February 2017
Ed Wood," You don't need to make great films, to be a great director ...
","In the cinematic universe, among the shining stars, Bogart, Hepburn, Chaplin, Hitchcock, there is a mysterious wobbly flying saucer, hanging on a visible string pulled by a God-like Bela Lugosi. This IFO, it's not unidentified since it's pretty obvious this is a plate, is Edward D. Wood Jr., and 'Ed Wood' one of the most surprisingly pleasant films of the last 20 years and probably, but that's my personal opinion, Tim Burton's masterpiece.The film works on the primary level of a well-directed biographical comedy. I expected some good laughs: I laughed. I expected to know more about the 'Worst Director of All-Time': I can say now, that the film grabbed my curiosity enough to make me check about Ed Wood, and his legacy has no secret for me anymore. And I expected a dazzling black and white cinematography handled by Tim Burton's magic direction, and well, my eyes were pleased too. 'Ed Wood' is a visual, self-reflexive, homage to the Golden Age of B-movies, where cinema was still a creative laboratory with no providential help from technology and 3D effects, a time when visual effects could be disastrous, or unintentionally hilarious.Now, what I didn't expect was how I would be moved by the story. 'Ed Wood' is more than a comedy or a biopic, it's an inspirational tribute to the devotion one can have for his work. It's about loving what we do, and enjoying it so intensely that any sensation your passion procures is thrilling. This 'living one's passion' aspect, incarnated by Johnny Depp's childish expression and constantly sparkling eyes, drew a big smile on my face encouraging me to approach my life differently. But the more touching facet driving the movie is the heart-breaking friendship between Ed Wood and the horror icon Bela Lugosi, at the nadir of his career. It's a somewhat sad running gag that many people think Lugosi's dead, as to highlight how Ed Wood literally resurrected him. This friendship is the heart of the film.And both Wood's dedication to his work, his profound respect and admiration to Lugosi incarnate the simple, but so overlooked, idea that love is what drives our lives. Ed Wood did films, managed to get people motivated and convinced they were doing something good, because his passion was communicative. When his pals were complaining about the harshness of a critic, he reassures them like a good and gentle man, in fact, he never talks negatively except during these moments of doubt he shares with his girlfriend, like some flashes of realization that desert him as soon as he remembers his personal dream : to be the next Orson Welles. And this positive mindset is the rainbow lighting Lugosi's bitter heart after years of stormy lows and a painful drug-addiction. I was blown away by Landau's performance: Martin Landau was the legendary Dracula's player even in the most unnoticeable mimics, looks, and majestic explosions of anger when the taboo 'Karloff' word was mentioned ... one of the most powerful supporting performances of the 90's, well deserving its Oscar. And the story's sad undertones were the perfect balance with the movie's wackiness.And there's something particularly fascinating in the way Burton presents it. In fact we never laugh at Ed Wood and his crew, but at the situations. Wood's troop is so touching and funny that we'd love to share their mood. The family is getting bigger from Bela Lugosi and Bill Murray as the caustic Bunny Breckinridge, to the iconic wrestler Tor Johnson, the delicious Vampira, and the distinguished hoax Crimswell whose predictions are as priceless as worthless, not to mention the chiropractor who'll replace Bela Lugosi after his death, notably in 'Plan 9 from Outer Space' : Woody's 'pride and joy', literally, 'The Godfather' of bad movies. We have a charming gallery of colorful characters so 'cartoonesque' it's like reality plagiarized fiction. Burton didn't need to make films about films, Wood's life is strange enough, marked with nonsensical signs of weirdness from the beginning. God, he wears wigs, angora sweaters and panties, and deals with it in the most serious manner. Is he a homo? No, he just likes to wear that, no big deal.And again, this is the touching aspect of the film: it shows a gentle face of Ed Wood, a director whose famous career is mostly preceded by the prefix 'in'. But that's because the point is to insist on his nerve, his insistence and his passion. His personal idol was Orson Welles, who inspired him to be an actor, director and writer. He doesn't have the talent, but he's got the guts, and despite the adversity, he still made films with the same passion and sincerity. As Welles told him in a great scene 'Why spend your life making someone else's dreams?' Wood fulfilled his dreams, his movies are cult, and his genius talent at making bad movies is a reference, when more talented directors sunk into oblivion. He loved the scenes as soon as they were shot, no retakes, when one scene could take a day, Ed Wood was making 20 or 30, due to the rush. This is less an alibi for Wood than a confirmation that he was born to make films. A very interesting scene is when the producer, watching the (in)famous 'Glen or Glenda' takes it at a joke and then genuinely laughs at the ridiculousness of the film. So bad it's good ...And this is what 'Glen or Glenda', 'Plan 9 From Outer Space' or any of Ed Wood's films are about, providing enjoyment, even unintentional. And if Wood managed to do that for many movie lovers after his death, that's enough. And it takes a certain genius to be an artist whose name is most remembered than his creations. And if he's remembered as the best from the worst, I guess it's probably more prestigious than being the worst of the best.",10,1,2,26 May 2011
Home Alone," The first Christmas classic of the 90's!
","I know this is a 'triple F' and 'triple C': feel-good fun family and classic Christmas comedy... so you'll forgive me to be a triple ass and introduce this review with a downer opening. Here it goes.We're in 2017, John Candy is comedy legend (sadly of the dead sort) since the mid-90's, John Hughes died in the same untimely fashion eight years ago, followed by Robert 'Old Man Marley' Blossoms two years later and John Heard, the father with such a lovable face, has died this summer. Sorry to go on this eulogy but even Roger Ebert and Gene SIskel who gave two thumbs down to the movie because of its implausible narrative and sadistic treatment of the villains, are also gone. This is just to show how this 1990 classic is already surrounded by an aura of nostalgic sadness.Of course, Chris Columbus, Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are alive and much alive but look at Macaulay Culkin, another sad example of the devastating effects of child stardom, although he's probably richer than I but he didn't exactly follow the 'Natalie Portman' path, not even the Anna Chlumsky one. Whenever I see him on the screen, I can't help but think of how this cute little face has turned to, but there are so many sad things about the lives that contributed to the movie that it almost plays like a sort of shelter for laughs, a time capsule for December 1990 or the whole early 90's, where we can comfortably enjoy Christmas in the lovable and cozy McCallister house and forget about the real stuff, the time of a movie.It's funny that there's so much escapism in such an enclosed movie.Besides, watching 'Home Alone' again in 2017 allows us to appreciate a time where even a good old-fashioned comedy could hit the box-office jackpot and be the highest grossing movie. No superheroes, no Transformers, no magical superpowers, the (r)evolution was on march, sure, but it didn't take much at that time to draw audience to the theaters, what counted was a simple concept and an appealing main character. The concept here is simply terrific: what would happen if a boy was left alone in his home? and during Christmas holidays at that, and when the kid is played by such an adorable and talented kid as Macaulay Culkin, half the work is done. There's also an interesting implication, every kid would love to be alone in such a big home (granted he's got enough to eat or buy food) but how about when it happens at the very time where you count on the presence of adults.... even for selfish reasons.I concede that John Hughes didn't really try to make an existential plot out of the concept, and picked the easy way, which was a confrontation between the boys and bad guys... but what bad guys! As Hitchcock said, a film is as good as the villain and Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern form a very interesting variation of 'Laurel and Hardy', 'George and Lenny', 'George and Junior' or 'Pinky and the Brain', the interaction between the two burglars while not reinventing the wheel, is the perfect foil to little Kevin's quick wits, agility and ability to come up with the most ingenuous devices in order to 'defend his home'. I think it's safe to consider that the film was already a winner once they got the concept, the kid and the villain. The rest was just a sort of icing on the cake, what kind of booby traps to install in the house, how to make it 'impossible' for the parents to reach their kid or for him to get help, and of course the 'spirit'... otherwise it wouldn't be a Christmas movie.So of course, it's going to be implausible, with such a title as 'Home Alone', you either have a comedy or a horror/thriller and if the movie had to be 'realistic', it wouldn't have taken more than three hours (movie time) to get Kevin out of the house and arrest the burglars. But we wouldn't have a movie either, we wouldn't have the 'Playboy' scene, the after-shave moment inspiring the iconic recreation of the 'Edvard Munch' painting with Kevin's trademark scream, whose only match was Marvin's shrill arachnophobia reaction. The film is a Christmas classic because it has filled that over-the-top category, if you want a movie that recreates the fun of Christmas in a realistic way, you have the no-less iconic 'A Christmas Story', but the concept of 'Home Alone' could only work with that level of slapstick. AndCulkin's performance is so good it even conveys a sort of edgy attitude, he's not your typical kid either, but he's still convincing enough as a kid.It's not just a matter of suspension of disbelief, but of 'let it go' for the sake of innocent fun, of course, watching this right now reveals some baffling contrivances we couldn't spot where the film came out, yes, we know the supposedly shovel murderer isn't a bad guy, we know Kevin relies a lot on the assistance of luck and perfect timing, we know it will all come down to the powerful family reunion and Catherine O'Hara provides the emotional arc of the film. Yes, it's true Marv and Harry aren't so bad they really deserve all the hurtful stuff that happen to them, and Kevin's scream can get annoying at times, but the film is closer to a live-action cartoon than a realistic comedy.And there is no way for 'Home Alone' not to make it in any Top 10 of classic Xmas movies, but maybe I'm biased because it was totally the kind of movies we used to watch countless times as kids to the point I always identified Tchaikovski's 'Nutcracker' music as the 'Home Alone' theme.",8,1,1,22 December 2017
The Hustler," Fascinating Introspection into the concepts of Winning and Losing ...
","'Eddie, you're a born loser', these five words still resonate in my mind, while I remember the conversation between 'Fast' Eddie Felson, Paul Newman's greatest and most fascinating role, and Bert Gordon, masterfully played by George C. Scott. Eddie is a hustler who uses his talent in pool for money, and he's ambitious enough to challenge the living Gods of the green table during high-stakes matches. His boyish smile and way of talk creates the perfect harmony between arrogance and vulnerability, both inspiring fear and sympathy, anything but suspicion. Paul Newman makes his role so believable that in no way, one can guess he's a hustler, which makes him a pretty good one. So Eddie makes money to challenge the big ones and when it comes to play the game for real, he believes in one thing : winning, and winning big time. So does Bert, a businessman, who believes in one and only one sacred principle : whatever you do, never lose your money. And this is what the whole movie is about, winning and losing.Watching 'The Hustler' is like an introspection into the whole concept of a game. What's the purpose of a game ? For the common majority, we play, we might lose or win, but we're entertaining ourselves and having fun. But for a small minority, there's no fun, no entertainment except if this leads to one thing : winning. Eddie belongs to this minority, and not only does he believe in winning, but it must follow the opponent's rules. It's over if the opponent says so. Winning doesn't count, it's the way you win. A winner has an attitude, he just doesn't win. For one thing, it's hard for us to disagree, since we don't know many lame winners, they all have this little something inspiring our fascination, our disdain but never our indifference. Eddie can't afford the attitude of the winner because as a potential winner he might be, he still carries the attitude of the loser, who's unconsciously always looking for an excuse. It's less the attitude of a loser than the attitude of the winner who wants to win so bad whatever he does, he loses. What Bert calls 'character' is attitude without efficiency. Eddie still has to learn from Minnesota Fats who plays and wins in a cool, detached elegance beautifully embodied by Jackie Gleason like a tailor-made tuxedo. There's indeed a gracious coolness in Fats's attitude : whatever Eddie lacks, Fats probably incarnates it. It must be the wisdom, the capability of knowing when to stop. The passion, the ferocious desire to win consumes Eddie's mind so much, he can't even realize when he's losing. Gordon notices that, and uses a provocative approach to tempt Eddie to work for him to get rid of this inner enemy, this 'character' in order to challenge Fats again, and win this time. But this character is something much deeper, transcending the context of the game. It's a blinding passion and egomania, making Eddie an eternally unsatisfied man, incapable of seeing happiness when it crosses his road. This is Eddie's tragedy.And this tragedy is incarnated by one character. Sarah Packard, played by Piper Laurie. Sarah is like a talentless Eddie's alter ego, a woman spending her life pretending to study, to be what she is not, filling the emptiness of her life as she fills a glass with alcohol. Alcohol fills her life, gives it a taste, makes her forget that she doesn't have anything else to do. Alcohol acts on her like pool on Eddie, with the same burning power, and that's why they understand each other, why their romance seem so realistic and natural. But I'm a bit unfair towards Sarah, she does have a talent that Eddie lacks : she knows what love is. She knows she loves Eddie who's too blinded by his ego to realize it, and when he does, it's too late. Seeing Eddie dealing with this relationship with the same ego than he does for pool, makes you realize how the old Bert was right. And the 'born loser' statement sounds like the premise of a tragedy. Losing a game is one thing, losing the woman of your life is another.The love story between Eddie and Sarah is the soul of 'The Hustler' and the tragedy in which Bert played a significant part, a heart-breaking conclusion. Bert believed in winning money, Eddie in winning a game, Sarah in winning by not losing the most precious things. And she's the one who got the true meaning of the word. If Eddie asked himself only once, what's the most valuable thing for him, and for Bert, maybe the tragedy could have been avoided. Sarah was like Eddie's therapy and so was he. When his thumbs were broken, they ironically became a perfect couple, and you could see Sarah's bitterness when she saw his hands healed. She declares her love but she needs the words but Eddie can't admit loving as much as losing, his character is too strong, and like I said, that's his tragedy.This is the tragedy of 'Fast' Eddie Felson, probably one of the most fascinating character studies ever made with my favorite game as a backdrop. A movie in black and white and a jazzy music, like a paradoxical mix of coolness and darkness, appearance of detachment for dark motives, the typical 'hustler' attitude.",10,2,4,12 January 2011
Spotlight," 'All the Archbishop's Men'... or 6% of them...
","Tom McCarthy's 'Spotlight' is one of these movies that are either loved or hated for the wrong reasons. Wherever your faith stands, it is not a charge against the Roman Catholic Church, but members of the Archdiocese who covered up ongoing child molestations and protected incriminated priests. The film's goal is less to make people question their faith on God, than on the men in charge of their faith. Ultimately, the Church's greatest enemy becomes the Church itself.And the film's brilliant screenplay erases all the controversy in one single line and I salute Tom McCarthy, the director of Catholic background, and co-writer with Josh singer, to have very intelligently made his point through one simple exchange. Reporter Mike Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo) is talking to one of the victims, and the man says he still considers himself a Catholic. How so? Mike asks. It's simple, the Catholic Church is an Institution, made by men, and men pass by while faith is eternal. Mike, a Catholic like many members of the 'Spotlight' unit, doesn't get it, but at least the point is made: the priests who commit these crimes were criminal and the whole investigation aims the accomplices, which leas to another masterstroke of writing: the portrayal of the 'villain'.Wait, what villain? Did I miss something? Was there a bad guy in the film? Not outside the script as McCarthy deliberately avoided depicting the incriminated Cardinal Law as a physical presence in the film, in order to avoid the presence of a polarizing villain. And sometimes, the invisibility of the 'bad guy' makes his influence even more fearsome, especially when, as the investigations progresses, the journalists understand it's not just about the Church, it's a whole system that is involved. And you can feel it from the directing, Boston, the Catholic city, the birthplace of the Kennedys, the setting of 'The Verdict' another thrilling courtroom drama with religious figures in cause, this Boston is a great city, but it feels rather small and confined in 'Spotlight', as to convey a sense of paranoid entrapment, you know like 'what happens in Boston, stays in Boston'.And this is exactly how the sexual abuses spread widely and became a pattern that would forever soil the image of the Church. No one took the responsibility, no one faced the facts, no lawyers had the guts to appeal to court and no journalist dared to dig deeper in the case, including the Globe, it was all settled privately. Everyone is responsible, and this is why the film's impartiality isn't to be challenged, they're all part of the same hypocrisy and like Mitchell Garabedian, Stanley Tucci as the lawyer who wrote a column accusing Cardinal Law of covering up a priest, 'it takes a city to raise a child, it takes a city to abuse one'. And I guess this is why it will take an outsider to start all over again. It's not too late after all, to make up lost time.Marty Barone (Liev Schreiber) is the new editor of the Globe, and sees the Garabedian's column as the tree that hides the forest. He asks the 'Spotlight' investigate unit, lead by 'Robby' Robinson (Michael Keaton) to investigate. Thanks to Rezendes' tenacity, Geberian blows the whistle and give other names, and the snowball effect leads to a series of convocations, door-knocks, interviews with the victims, lawyers who were in charge of the case, and from a few priests, it turns to 6% of the Archdiocese being involved. And like its glorious predecessor, 'All the President's Men', 'Spotlight' makes a thriller out of a relatively safe mission without threatening phone calls, death threats, gunshots or chases in dark parking lots.But if the journalists' lives are not at stakes, the harm is already done for the victims' lives, forever ruined as it wasn't just 'physical, but psychological' abuse, so what the investigation does is a quest for justice and for shining (literally) the spotlight on the people who let some awful crimes to be and let be done. 'What's your responsibility to publish this?' Mike is asked by a judge, his answer is perfect: 'what's our responsibility not to publish it'. It's a matter of ethics, and as the white knights, Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams make an interesting Redford-Hoffman-like pair with Keaton as 'Jason Robards', encouraging the team to go further, or slow down for tactical reasons. Tlming matters as well and it's for these little subtleties, that the screenplay is a winner.'Spotlight' is one of the year's most critically acclaimed movies, and the Best Picture front-runner, earning a nomination for Best Supporting Actor (Ruffalo was the pounding heart of the film) and for directing and screenplay. Speaking of the screenplay, there's an abundance of name-dropping in the film and that can get pretty confusing, (there's even a moment where they kept referring to Law, and I didn't know it was the name of a Cardinal). But these considerations are trivial because it was the same with 'All the President's Men' and it wasn't much an issue, as the film is most about the procedural than the details, the big scope: how this team of five journalists will make the light of truth shine. And McCarthy's sober directing, respectful to our intelligence, doesn't overdo the cheers, the last shot alone is emotionally rewarding.For playing in the safe side and for its own good, 'Spotlight' turns out to be one of the best movies of 2015, and shouldn't be judged for its attack against the Church, but for its fight for the truth, for justice and for the dignity of the victims who were too scared to translate their pain into words. Indeed, it's hard enough to talk about 'sexuality' and religion in public statements, imagine in the same sentence. And it's reassuring that the film was also well-received by the Church which, in a way, is coming to terms with its own demons.",9,3,6,22 February 2016
My Neighbor Totoro," No one understands the soul of childhood like Hayao Miyazaki...
","Miyazaki's movies demand more viewings, not because they're too complex, but because their narratives and visuals are so rich you can easily miss a detail. 
Still, 'Totoro' looked startlingly simple and straight-forward, there wasn't much intrigue, or even character-development, it's not even a coming-of-age story, despite being a childhood adventure and while there's no villain, there's no conflict whatsoever to enhance the dramatic outlook.But it's precisely for these reasons that I watched it again, and this time, I had the proper key to open my heart and let the magic operate: my daughter who's the same age as Mei, four years (actually she just celebrated it today). We saw the cartoon together and I didn't miss any detail, I couldn't since each scene she asked me question, about the soot sprites, the haunted house, why are they laughing in the bath, why are their little dark things leaving the house? And I had to pay attention to all these tiny details because she wouldn't miss one, just like Mei... and then I realized that Miyazaki understood children.I said this is a children movie; less because it deals with children but because it's oriented toward children. And maybe it's because Mei is the smallest one that she could spot these rabbit-like ears in the grass and then discover a white little creature with the same role than the white rabbit in 'Alice in Wonderland'. But Miyazaki doesn't use that scene for a narrative purpose, if he cared for narrative, the titular Totoro would have appeared fifteen minutes earlier. Miyazaki sets the mood, he lets us contemplate the place, the house and the beautiful nature with that watercolor quality so typical of the anime style.As usual there are many long moments where nothing happens, or nothing special, which is the antithesis of screen writing but the essence of life, sometimes, things take time to happen. And we have almost thirty seconds where Mei is trying to catch the little rabbit and we see nothing else, except for a butterfly entering from the other side of a cabin and getting out from the hole Mei is staring at. I hadn't noticed that butterfly before and it didn't change much to my comprehension of the film but its adorable randomness made me smile. Never underestimate the appeal of 'insignificant' details.Finally, Mei spots the rabbit and he's following a bigger one, the two run away leaving nuts and seeds on the ground and after a chase across the forest, she finally lands near the hollow of a camphor tree where Totoro is sleeping. What a delightfully anticlimactic entrance! Myazaki's most iconic creation just lying there and being slightly disturbed by a small girl. We're not even sure his name is Totoro, it seems to be the way she interpreted his repeated roars... or yawns. Mei baptizes him Totoro and seems to be the only privileged kid to see her, for a while.But here again, Miyazaki avoids all the clichÃ©s of the genre, Mei's father believes her and explains that the creature is probably the master of the forest or some protective spirit. And her sister Satsuki while the voice of wisdom at the age of 10 and the substitute mother... envies her kid sister. Miyazaki understands children so much that he grasps the different layers of childhood representing them like the small and average rabbit, he knows a kid of four will be playful and incapable of reasoning or being reasoned while an older one will still be innocent but aware of the tough implications of the world.But once Totoro is there, Satsuki and Mei are both incarnations of the spirit of childhood, they literally jump at his tummy and fly together, this is a magnificent scene but we've seen flying already in Miyazaki, how about perhaps the most iconic moment where the two sisters and Totoro wait for a bus, and Satsuki gives him an umbrella. We talked about moments where nothing happens, whatever this scene is supposed to mean is secondary beyond the fact it inspires a wild smile and a certain warmth... and that it introduces the second iconic creation of Myazaki, the Chesire-like cat-bus. 
Only a mind that understands children can be that creative... and Miyazaki knows childhood with the same intelligence as he respects ours, he knows the kids won't jump in the cat-bus, they're waiting for their father. For all the magic and fantasy the film carries, it's only because it's rooted in the reality of the world, incarnated by the beautiful landscapes or the sickness of the mother or relationships between parents and children or inter-generational, that we're transported by Totoro. He only pops up when reality is sometimes too tough to handle, even for children.And I can't imagine any children not being responsive to the film, Walt Disney said that every film should have morale, for every laugh there should be a tear, that one scare or two can be stimulating but while 'My Neighbor Totoro' has some dramatic tension, this is a film consistently gentle and sweet about its own material as if a world where Totoro didn't need villains or antagonists to make its point. As ifTotoro was the master of the film, spiritually. 
Miyazaki took that gentle approach we'll also find in movies like 'Kiki' or 'Ponyo', with a basic story and not too fancy animation but a huge emotional outlook just like 'Dumbo' was the most popular Disney film while not as sophisticated as 'Fantasia' or ambitious as 'Bambi'. But 'Totoro' is more than a Japanese Dumbo, it's an icon so popular even the opening song (a catchy march tune) became a children rhyme. No wonder it became the Studio mascot. And since the name refers to an airplane engine. You have the essence of Miyazaki's creation in that blue cardboard opening in each of his films.",9,0,0,22 December 2017
Juno," I hated it, then I liked it ... but each time for the 'wrong reasons' ...
","Anyone with an IMDb account is old enough to remember the phenomenon 'Juno' was in 2007, much more than the independent-movie-of-the-year, it was an unidentified cinematic object buzzing in Hollywood's sky. No one saw it coming, a movie written by an ex-stripper with an allusive pen name (Diablo Cody), directed by a film-maker whose last name was more famous than the first (Ivan as Reitman Jr.), and featuring new faces, Ellen Page, Michael Cera who was not type-casted yet as the awkward-teenager. 'Juno' was new and style-wise, it was clearly establishing its distance from typical teenage movies.But I thought the film was needlessly excessive in its style, as if the director was obsessed with the idea of creating something hip, cool, pop, whatever. I couldn't get off my mind how atypical Juno was, and how typical her annoying best friend was, how overly nice were Juno's father and step-mother (Allison Braney) and how innocent was Paulie Bleeker, the unwilling father played by Cera. I thought the film was trying too hard to contradict all the teen- movies' stereotypes; and indeed, it was praised for that and I can see why  but I didn't feel its spontaneity, I thought it was like calculated, even formatted, as if beneath the script, there was a sort of Marketing Junior manager who made a brainstorm about 'How to create an original film'. I know it's supposed to be an independent production, but regarding its success, the story's sincerity should be questioned.However, I didn't dislike the character either, there was something appealing that wasn't so obvious. I guess the film was like pregnant of its own emotional core, only visible after we get used to the characters. Take the idea of the passing of time, it's regularly suggested in the film through the seasons and the way nature influences the environment as much as Juno's learning process. The film is in fact, as moody, spontaneous and capricious as Juno's mind can get. And that's how I reconciled with its 'calculated' spontaneity and prefabricated wit. When I sincerely wanted to strangle one character or two, I realized it was part of the characterization itself. I thought the stepmother was too rude with the nurse who was obviously reacting to Juno's lack of emotional reaction, as I wanted Juno's stupid friend to shut her mouth or stop dancing in the hospital, but how many times did I have this feeling toward people in real-life. I thought maybe this was the paradoxical nature of 'Juno', to feel irritatingly real when it tries to be cinematically memorable  I used to think on the contrary that it was sometimes irritatingly cinematic when it tried to be realistically memorable. It showed off a lot, but it's almost forgivable as it's part of Juno's age. And this is what the film is, through a simple journey into pregnancy; it's the coming-of-age of an insouciant teen-ager, a girl of her era, facing the responsibility of an irresponsible act, as a major step in the adult world, while, she's as much a child as the little human being she carries. But on that aspect, the film deals with pregnancy much better than what I would have expected, and considerably redeems its flaws in my opinion.Typically, I avoided 'Juno', thinking it would be some kind of feminist preach for the right of women to dispose with her body. Well, 'Juno' doesn't waste its time in the 'to keep or not to keep' dilemma, it's pretty clear that for Juno, abortion doesn't rhyme with option. And don't get me wrong, I'm not a pro-life advocate but I'm tired of the constant trivialization of abortion in the name of so many human rights. I know a baby looks like a shrimp in the early days, but life is still big deal, and it's not a sort of take-it or leave-it package. Aborting in my opinion says a lot, about the consumerist attitudes that conduct our different choices, and the merit of 'Juno' is to get its character surprisingly involved in the process of preparing a baby for a couple who wants to adopt. 'Juno', literally strikes by its conservative message through the powerful chronicle of an act of generosity, giving a proper meaning to the word 'carrying life' and marvelously incarnated by Jennifer Garner's performance, which should have earned her more accolades. Maybe, Diablo Cody is a ultra-feminist but then, she didn't use her character to make a feminist statement. Sure, men are not given very deep roles, and if the film is made by a woman who know about women, it should have given more depth to the male side, but still, it happens to provide a beautiful message about motherhood, even as something that shouldn't be taken for granted, but that exists in the heart of every girl: this desire to give life.Garner plays with perfection the desperateness of a woman motivated to become what she believes is the reason-to-be of women, while her husband Mark still mourns his artistic dreams and develops a complicity with Juno, based on horror movies and punk-music, which says a lot about his degree of maturity. Characters do feel real after all, and at the end, 'Juno' is not a plot's film; it's about a slice in the life of people far from being one-dimensional. I thought the film was trying too much to be original, smart, hip, cool, moody and spontaneous, but so was Juno  but there is a heart inside and it waits a little before blooming. I realized that when I saw Bleeker and Juno together and Juno crying, they still loved each other.The so-called 'Juno' effect makes me hope that the image of woman carrying life will never becomes old-fashioned or synonym of conservatism. Or maybe after disliking 'Juno' for wrong reasons, I feel like like it now but again for the wrong reasons.",8,0,3,5 September 2012
L.A. Confidential," Reinventing the 'Good Cop - Bad Cop' Trope ...
","You know what all neo-noir masterpieces have in common? They didn't even try to be noir, their power relied on confident directing, perfect writing and solid acting and the whole thing just looked fresh, original and possibly the best thing for a movie: to be watchable and re-watchable. This is 'L.A. Confidential' in a nutshell, one of the best movies of the 90's.Adapted from a novel by James Ellroy, the plot is the kind of masterpiece of stylish complexity that is just too labyrinthine for the big screen, yet Curtis Hanson compresses everything into a neat episodic structure so that by the end of each act, we've progressed in the comprehension of what is going on and the changes it has on the main protagonists. As a matter of fact, the characterization matters more than the investigation, which is saying a lot because the investigation surrounding a massacre at a seedy night-club (naturally, only the tip of the iceberg), is captivating as hell.But let's get back to the characters, this is the meatiest part of the film. 'L.A. Confidential' focuses on three cops who couldn't have been more different: Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey), Ed Exley (Guy Pearce) and Bud White (Russell Crowe).Vincennes is a consultant for a 'Dragnet'-like show called 'Badge of Honor', which makes him a movie star by proxy. What does that mean? Simply that in the early 50's, Hollywood became the new Sodom what's with all the booze, drugs, the criminal wave following the arrest of local mobster Mickey Cohen and of course trashy star-studded tabloids' headlines covered by Hush-Hush magazine editor Sid Hudgens (Danny De Vito). Vincennes embraced the sleaziness of the city without letting its soil his nice suit, he bribes, blackmails and takes ethical shortcuts but never at the expenses of law enforcement. As his Captain smartly advises 'don't try to do the right thing, you haven't had the practice', sill, Vincent might not be clean but he's the essence of cool, so we forgive him.Exley is the steely ambitious college-boy whose glasses and 'Holier-than-thou' attitude earns him a range of reactions that go from tacit suspicion to sheer contempt; it also earns him his first promotion thanks to a fine tactical move. Exley might not be likable but he's not despicable either because we admire a cop who'd trade popularity for principles. Finally, Bud White strikes as the anti-Exley, this is a guy who hits first and asks the questions later, he doesn't rat on his partners and is known for his particular hatred toward woman-beaters. He happens to be the right-hand man of Captain Dudley Smith (James Cromwell) and occasionally, the right-fist man when some punchy methods are required against criminals. And at the top of the pyramid, Dudley Smith makes good use of White's brutal force and Exley's by-the-book standards. He knows pretty well how to use his boys like so many pieces of a chess game and even dispose of some nuisance when comes a risk to compromise the image of LAPD.So from this gallery of original character, It all comes down to one pivotal moment where our opinions are challenged. Exley stop to be an ambitious opportunist, but a man with a personal record to settle and who knows how to be tough and bad-ass, White shows a warmer side of him notably through his interactions with a hooker named Lynn (Kim Basinger) and Vincennes also has a moment of realization, that can't be spoiled. The film is about three men who become aware of their limitations but move forward, because there's always a line you mustn't cross. Speaking of Basinger, she won her Oscar for her performance as Lynn, a hooker who screams 'femme fatale' but whispers an emotional fragility that channels Faye Dunaway in 'Chinatown'. In fact, she embodies one essential aspect of the film; nothing is exactly what it seems.This notion serves one of the film's many subplots, involving a doctor, played by David Strathairn, turning escort-girls into celebrities' lookalikes. The confusion culminates with an embarrassing but hilarious mistake committed by Excel, one. that shows how cinema, police and crime were easily interlocked, and that the city of angels couldn't do without a few devils here and there. The omnipresence of corruption is persistent in the plot and it's less a matter than realizing who is bad and who is not, but to which extent they are. And you can't get to such multi-layered level complexity without top-notch acting. It is a credit to the late Hanson to have cast the two fresh faces of Pearce and Crowe to star in an American period picture. Speaking of these two actors, one of the many delights of 'L.A. Confidential' is to see these rivals with diverging methods realizing that they serve the same case and need to cooperate.The screenplay (second Oscar-winning category) is quite self-conscious about the way it retreads the good cop / bad cop cliché, so it uses a scene that reinvents the trope in such an inventive and brutal way, 'L.A. Confidential' becomes immune to any comparison. When a pompous big shot ends up panting in a fetal positions, you know these guys mean business.Well, that's what 'L.A. Confidential' in a nutshell, a movie that means business with guys who learn a thing or two in the process. It might get a little conventional during the climactic showdown but to say something that can only be applied to the best noir movies: it's not the destination that counts, but the journey.",10,2,3,15 March 2017
The Jungle Book," The greatest combination of animation, action and ... music ...
","Released at a pivotal time in Disney's history, the difficulty to classify 'The Jungle Book' in terms of generation, of eras: not from the Golden Age or Disney Renaissance, gives it a sort of privileged place in Disney's list of animated classics.Most fans would say this is one of the best Disney films, if not the best, and despite my sentimental weakness for 'Aladdin', I concede that 'The Jungle Book' is the one I enjoy the most. No other Disney film beats it on the entertainment department: it has the catchiest set of songs: jazzy, swingy, and sometimes hypnotic and the most colorful gallery of characters combining human's stereotypical traits with a realistic drawing. From the villainous Kaa, the sneaky snake and Shere Khan, the evilly refined tiger, to Hathi, the so-military elephant and the groovy vultures, 'The Jungle Book' is a Disneyan 'Animalistic Comedy' conducted by animators at the top of their game. But again, as the bare necessity of any Disney film, the movie works thanks to the story.'The Jungle Book' finds the perfect balance between two universes too often dissociated, humans and animals. Disney films can be divided into two main categories. First, there are the human-centered stories, notably those adapted from fairy-tales like 'Snow White' or 'Pinocchio' where real animals are reduced to peripheral purposes and hardly communicate. The more defining of Disney touch are the animal-centered films, which feature the world from their perspective and their interaction with humans mostly made of antagonism, to better understand the level of 'humanity' we can learn from those creatures and question ours, three masterpieces come to mind 'Dumbo', 'Bambi' and 'Lady and the Tramp'.'The Jungle Book' transcends this antagonism to a more psychological level, through the story of a little boy, virtually made an animal from his raising by a family of wolves and his tutoring by a black panther named Baghera, who must return back to the men's village to escape from the terrifying Shere Khan, the tiger who made every man a personal enemy, a hatred rooted in his irrational fear of fire: the element that interestingly differentiates humans and animals, fire as synonym of weapon, the same that killed Bambi's mom, or the same fire that almost destroyed the forest when men were hunting. Although Mowgli never learned how to make a fire, because he's still an animal, he carries his own race's dangerous heritage, his life is threatened because of his 'human nature', which makes the assimilation of 'animal culture' totally pointless. The irony is that the 'animal culture' is very similar to humans: elephants constituted an army, monkeys a kingdom, so the line between the two worlds becomes very uncertain.But 'The Jungle Book' insists on making these two worlds totally incompatible through various episodes starting with Mowgli trying to adapt, becoming an elephant, dancing and partying with the monkeys, even standing up to Shere Khan but ultimately, his weakness as a human prevents him from being accepted. This is the point, Mowgli can become stronger only with a human entourage, it's not about differences as weaknesses, but as potential strengths. And Mowgli's coming-of-age can only be achieved when he'll understand the foolishness of wanting to be what we are not, a lesson that should also learn the zany King Louie who wants to know the secret of fire from Mowgli, to be 'just like humans'. Mowgli's dilemma is to accept his own condition and do what nature commands is undermined by an emotional conflict: Baloo vs. Baghera.During the first act, Mowgli is lead by Bagherra whose mission is to conduct Mowgli to the village. Baghera is a serious and no-nonsense character with an admirable sense of responsibility. But Mowgli chose Baloo as a fatherly figure because Baloo is simply a big kid who takes life just the way it comes. The 'Bare Necessities' song is the ultimate hymn for all the lazy, easy-going and positive-attitude guys in the world and this is what drives the bear's life. Baloo and Baghera are the perfect yin and yang for the story, the fun and the serious, the classic polarization of Disney. And this duality made of constant argument reaches its pinnacle in one of my three favorite scenes of the film, when Baloo reassures Baghera that he'll handle everything until the name Shere Khan is mentioned and suddenly, the tone of Baloo dramatically changes, and we can already feel that the two animals are inspired by the same love and desire to protect Mowgli.My two other favorite moments, although not the most 'impacting' occur when Mowgli finally meets Shere Khan, and is given ten seconds to run away, Mowgli confidently gets himself ready to fight where Shere Khan suddenly jumps roaring at Mowgli's terrified face, in one secondÂ… before Baloo's providential interaction, Mowgli as a vulnerable little child. My last favorite moment is when Baghera starts singing at the end of the film after Mowgli chose to go by himself. It was a nice twist from a very serious character, adding the same level of three-dimensionality than when even the cool and good-natured Baloo decided to take Mowgli to the village. And speaking of the ending, although it's not a canon of adaptation from Rudyard Kipling book, it's morally faithful to the spirit of the film that commands to each creature to be among its own, and Mowgli didn't need to be pushed by Baghera or kept by Baloo, he made his decision alone, after being hypnotized not by a more pleasing form of Kaa-like creatures.'The Jungle Book' is a cheerful and dazzling celebration of the Disney heritage, talking animals, coming-of-age story, music, dance, thrills and chills and for every laugh, a little tear, but not so much tear in a very feel-good film, except one for the great Walt Disney who couldn't have a greater epitaph honoring his extraordinary contribution on the field of animation and entertainment.",10,1,4,27 December 2011
Match Point," Survival of the Luckiest...
","And I thought 'Crimes and Misdemeanors' was cynical because it established the triumph of reason over heart, 'March Point' is even worse, because Allen finds something more valuable than reason: luck.Speaking of reason, there is a reason why Woody Allen is such a prolific filmmaker, none of his films look for profitability or critical acclaim, he makes what he thinks is good, and it's enough (we're talking of the director who didn't show up in the Oscars when 'Annie Hall' won the Best Picture Oscar) but it takes many good films to reach once or twice a decade, the 'Nirvana'. Some Allen's movies hit the perfect chord and are so impressively flawless that they always make you feel like you've seen nothing of Allen yet.Out of the forty-something movies he made, I have certainly watched three dozens and well, I wasn't prepared by how good 'Match Point' would be. Even halfway through the film, I didn't know where it was going, but near the third act, I knew I was watching a Woody Allen film with capital A. The ending made me realize it was more serious than that, it was probably one of his best. I had to watch it a second time then a third time, and I maintain that it's one of his best, and for two reasons.On a technical level (to get through it), this is a film that is flawlessly acted and scenes flow with such fluidity that when you see it again, you can see that there's no detail that doesn't play a pivotal role, yet without its inclusion feeling contrived or artificial. The second aspect is the way the ending makes the beginning's point, the film has a message to tell from the story and it's not until the last five minutes that we realize how brilliantly Allen toyed with our expectations, making the point we expected him to make but not as we thought.I will get back to the story because being too talkative about the ending might spoil the surprise. The film is about an Irish tennis teacher Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), a young man with dashing good looks who gets a job in an English country club. He meets Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode), they exchange a few words about music, earning him an immediate invitation to an Opera concert. Tom comes from a rich family (the father, played by Brian Cox 'own' companies) and they seem to like Chris, and the daughter, Chloe (Emily Mortimer) instantly falls in love with him. He gets Chloe and a job in Daddy's company as collateral gift. This is like Cinderella story in speed motion.And there's no catch actually, this is no Faustian pact of anything of that sort, Chris has basically everything a sensitive man would look for, especially one of his background, a steady job, a loving and pretty wife and money, so Chris is the one who looks for trouble. He meets Nora, Tom's fiancée, a sexy aspiring actress, and it's not love but lust-at-first-sight, Chris is invaded by an immediate and intense desire to possess her. And since their luscious interactions behind the ping pong table, we know it's a matter of time before they succumb to the call of lust, catalyzed by anger, booze and rain.But this sexual intercourse has only intensified his appetite. The situation gets tricky when he realizes he can't renounce his lifestyle either. This is not the Cornelian conflict between duty and passion, but between greed and sex, the two drivers of society. In a way, Chris is the pure embodiment of modernity in its most pervert form, like when he marries Chloe and gets Nora pregnant. I already had feelings of déjà vu but the pregnancy subplot immediately reminded me of a classic of American Cinema 'A Place in the Sun'. Yet the film was nominated for Best Original Screenplay, maybe it's a way to acknowledge that the 'American Tragedy' classic is a universal story with infinite variations.Allen also seems to have borrowed elements from his critically acclaimed 'Crimes and Misdemeanors', which featured a similar situation but was more about religion, moral and the dilemma between reason and conscience. In 'Match Point', Woody chooses a different angle, a sort of existential tennis match between work and luck. The film opens with the sight of a tennis ball swinging back and forth like so many up and downs that life has to provide and then the ball hits the net and bounce, it's all about the side of the court it will fall in: one means victory, another means defeat.Life is as simple as that and I'm in total agreement because I used to believe in chronically bad luck, on being screwed, but I realized life was made through a few hit-or-miss moments and all the hard work of the world can see its effect canceled if you make the wrong move at the wrong time, sometimes you're lucky, sometimes not but never underestimate the potentiality of luck within the bad luck. Woody Allen who loved to play or portray unlucky schmucks caught in the midst of modernity, focuses here in the case of a particularly lucky character and we wait for the moment it changes. Maybe this is why it doesn't feel like an Allen film, but I'm not even sure there's such a thing as a typical Allen film.I had just seen a masterpiece about 'bad luck' called 'A Serious Man' and now I have its polar opposite with 'Match Point'. The two movies have interesting things to say about the way we control our own fates, whether under the direction of God or hazard, which also echoes the religious undertones of 'Crimes and Misdemeanors', but someone said 'Hazard is the anonymous way to call God', sometimes, it might be the anonymous way to call the devil as well, and I will say no more.",10,2,5,14 September 2016
Yes Man," Why say 'no' when you can say 'yes' ... I repeat, when you CAN say 'yes' ...
","Back in the high school days, my neighbor at table wanted to copy my homework, I said 'no', it was an essay, and the teacher would notice the obvious similarities. He took it very badly and sat in another table. The next afternoon, I gave him the paper, what made me change my mind, he asked me. I thought 'what the hell', what made the goddamn paper so serious anyway. He was pleasantly surprised, 14 years later; the guy is still my best friend, and it was a 'yes' that paved the way to our relationship.In a similar case, Jim Carrey is Carl, the main protagonist of 'Yes Man', a man alienated by his perpetually negative outlook on life. He refuses to attend at his friends' parties, he refuses every proposition in his bank loan office job, his 'No' are the convenient escapism to any form of unpredictability that could spice up his life a little bit. Since his divorce, Carl sticks to his habits of loneliness and bitterness, to a point we wonder if we're really watching a comedy. Granted it's only the set-up before the life-changing experience but some parts were surprisingly depressing, and a more restrained Jim Carrey didn't make things better.His life comes to a miserable dead-end, until he discovers, from an old colleague, a 'Yes!' seminar whose inspirational guru Terrence played by the namesake Stamp, challenges him to say 'yes' to everything during an entire year. Carl accepts and the 'yes' attitude promises a series of funny situations. You guessed it; 'Yes Man' follows exactly the same pattern as another (and funnier) Jim Carrey movie, named 'Liar, Liar'. Since all the best comedies rely on a promising plot, try to compare the two situations, which is funnier: a lawyer who can't say one lie during one day or an average schmuck saying 'yes' to everything although he can say 'no'.What made 'Liar, Liar' so irresistible was that Carrey's character was incapable to say a lie, he was victim of a curse, and one we accept it because 'lying is indeed wrong'. In 'Yes Man', the eventuality of a curse in underdeveloped but there's no doubt that Carl can say 'no' and in fact, he SHOULD. Ever since he starts his 'yes' attitude, and accepts to take a bum to some place and give him the money he asks, we know there are limits to the positive attitude. And we know it's a matter of time before Carl realizes the limits of saying 'Yes' to everything. Nothing is more unfortunate than a comedy where you're one step ahead of the characters, no matter how sympathetic they are.The main problem of 'Yes Man' is to take the (so so) originality of its plot for granted and fill it with comedic archetypes that reduce the talent of Jim Carrey rather than liberate it. When Carl accepts to say 'yes' during the first nights, he ends up stranded in a park, and this is where he meets Allison (Zooey Deschanel), a young (maybe too young) nonconformist artist riding him back on her scooter to the next gas station. Allison is a girl who seizes the day, sings, takes running photographs, enjoys the unpredictability of life, basically, she's a natural 'yes, girl'. Carl follows her by saying 'yes, to everything she does.Again, we know it's a matter of time before they would start loving each other, and before the 'yes' too many would come. Yet, despite some predictable plot points, Peyton Reed's movie depicts in an enjoyable way the exhilaration of saying 'yes'. Carl bonds his with his friends, his nerdy boss, he takes the courage to jump off a bridge, in the most memorable part of the film (and it's only fitting that Carrey did it himself, embodying the main message of the film). Carl learns guitar, takes flying course, attends Korean lessons, and meets an Iranian girl, the way all of his new lessons converge to an unpredictable and hilarious gag, is one of the film's highlight.The film also focuses on Carl's profession and it's interesting that his new attitude, allows him to bond with his boss, in another twist reminding of 'Liar, Liar'. By never rejecting the customers, Carrey basically reinvented the micro-loans and earned the company more benefits and a great reputation. Carl's job reveals the film's softer side, and kind of reminds of the James Bailey-figure from 'It's a Wonderful Life'. The part where everyone helps him at the end, provides the obligatory moral that every service is rewarded, and no man a failure who has friends, and a 'yes' can open many friendships.This is why I started with the story of my best friend and this is why I feel indulgent toward 'Yes Man' who despite its predictability is redeemed by its positive feeling à la Frank Capra. I only wished the movie would give more flexibility to Jim Carrey to let him express his usual goofiness. Carrey is such a comedic genius you never get tired of his mimic or clown mannerisms, and 'Yes Man' is no exception, no matter how funny are some parts plot-wise, they're never as hilarious as when Jim Carrey plays with his face. No one can reach his level of comic, so why preventing us from that, especially since it doesn't even ruin the overall mood of the film? My comparison with 'Liar, Liar' wasn't meant to diminish the merit of 'Yes Man', if not the best, but one of the sweetest Jim Carrey's comedies, but to highlight the level it had to equal: it had the message, it needed the laughs. Yes the message was positive, but predictable. I didn't need it personally, I remember one of my uncle's sayings, which best summarizes the experience of Carl, 'Why say 'no' when you can say 'yes''. And that's the point, sometimes, you can't say 'yes', which gives more value to the word.",7,1,2,15 February 2013
Midnight in Paris," You don't talk about Art, you experience it!
","Woody Allen, who directed 'Manhattan' and 'Vicky Cristina Barcelona' depict towns with such a unique talent they would always transcend their setting status and feel as real and lively as characters. And considering his enduring love for Paris, the most beautiful and artistically influential town in the world, I guess cinema was begging for an Allen film set in Paris, and 2011 was the year it was finally done. With the talent I mentioned about characterizing towns, there was no doubt the movie would immediately make us fall in love with Paris, so the challenge was elsewhere, the movie had to maintain all the charm and wit used from Allen's incredible streak of Oscar-nominated scripts. 'Midnight in Paris' needed to surprise, to bring out some unexpected elements, and on that level, I'm glad the marketing campaign labeled the film simply as a 'romantic comedy' failing to reveal what it was about in such a misleading way I'm sure it was deliberate, because I was not only surprised, but gladly too.The movie starts with a predictable tribute to Paris, a series of postcards showing the most notorious places of the capital, Champs-Elysees, Sacré Coeur, Notre Dame, the Triumph Arc, Paris on a sunny day, Paris under the rain, Paris by night 'naturellement', and the opening to conclude with the most defining monument of Paris, the Eiffel Tower. It was a nice introduction, conducted by a jazzy music, Woody Allen knows how to marry the right music with the right place as he did with George Gershwin's rhapsodies in his 'Manhattan', as if a love story should combine musical and geographical elements in love between each other. 'Midnight in Paris' started like I would have expected, and I sincerely hoped it would be less touristic or less 'Paris for Dummies'.Maybe I'm biased because I spent 8 years of my youth in Paris, and never felt like a tourist in there. I've always loved the charm of the unknown little streets, the pleasure to get lost and walk to discover some unexpected little treasures, avoiding buses, subways and traffic jams and simply walking at night on a bridge or a pedestrian street. I know Paris, and I know it's a town we love even more when we don't 'play the tourist'. Sure there are great places to visit, and I can't recommend enough to visit the Louvre or Montmartre, but don't ever take Paris for granted just because you saw the most iconic monuments. There's more to discover in Paris, and more to discover in you through Paris' eyes. So, I'm biased but not that I challenged Woody to surprise me about Paris but showing me something better than a human version of 'The AristoCats'.So  'Midnight in Paris' starts with a conflict, Gil (Owen Wilson) is a screenwriter and wannabe writer who tells Inez his fiancée (Rachel McAdams), how in love he is with Paris, and she admits failing to see the appeal of the town, especially the overrated fascination for rainy Paris. She's a no-nonsense woman, who loves dances and nightclubs; he's nostalgic of the inter-war period Paris. Well, when a romantic comedy starts with a couple you wonder how they ever decided to marry. But from a director who made more than 40 films, it's less to create some stereotypical situations than a feeling of discomfort through the character of Gil, so blinded by his fascination that his personality can't emerge.The movie echoes the beginning of one of his Woody Allen's most endearing classics 'The Purple Rose of Cairo' featuring Mia Farrow as Cecilia, a timid character who could only express herself through her love for movies until her life changed when a movie character came off the screen and discovered with her the real world. In 'Midnight in Paris', Gil also makes an extraordinary discovery, every night at midnight, a mysterious car embarks him to a fantastic ride in the 20's Paris, when it was an intellectual laboratory of creativity and revolutionary concepts that enriched the fields of culture, arts, science and entertainment, welcoming such influential artists as Salvador Dali, Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Cole Porter, Pablo Picasso, when Art was something to experience, to live, not to be just pompously'described'.In this journey, we discover the nostalgic side of Paris when it was synonym of jazz, surrealism, cubism, artistic revolution, fashion, fun, France, the World! Gil discusses literature, art, women, life with a scene-stealing Hemingway (Corey Stole), he explains his condition to the non-impressed surrealist Dali (Adrian Brody) and has the privilege to have his manuscript read by Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates). The movie doesn't avoid the love triangle, since he falls in love with Picasso and Modigiliani's mistress, the beautiful Adriana (Marion Cotillard). Adriana is interesting and intriguing as she also feels nostalgic toward Paris from the past, the Belle Epoque, the Paris of Gauguin, Moulin Rouge and Toulouse Lautrec. And Allen, with his unique talent, would surprise in one extraordinary twist showing that Paris would never lose its nostalgic appeal.There were countless possibilities, the film could have explored the existential Paris, and featured Sartre, Boris Vian, Edith Piaf and Nat King Cole. Paris' charm is eternal although something might have been lost by the devastating effect of modernity, when an old and fashion café in the 20's becomes a lavatory in the 2010's. The 2010's aspect of the film isn't the highlight of the film anyway with its gallery of characters written more as plot devices: the irritating fiancée, the Parisian soul mate, making the 20's artist looking more authentic and I cared less about French-audience-pleasing Carla Bruni or Gad El Maleh's cameos. Paris stole the show!The charm of the film relied on the depiction of the magical charm of Paris and as an artist myself, this vision reconciled me with the town and made me wonder if I would go living there again.

Milk," An Engaging Hymn for Tolerance ...
","'Milk' is one of the best films of the last decade. I usually don't start my reviews with the conclusion, but this is a point I insist to start with, to avoid any misunderstanding.Let's get this straight (no pun intended). I assume that most male viewers would feel uncomfortable while watching scenes of masculine intimacy. In all fairness, I don't think this is a hint of a repressed homophobia, but more the consequences of a taboo that maintained heterosexuality as the cinematic norm, reducing homosexuality to stereotypes, indirect foils to the heroes' straightness, or in a few cases of plot significance, nothing explicitly depicting homosexual intimacy, I mean, just as 'graphic' as the heterosexual treatment.This is why the direction is crucial. Gus Van Sant goes straight forward by showing the most intimate scenes of nudity and implied sexuality during the first minutes. It's unusual, uneasy, but it's honest and gives you time to acclimate your eyes, and stop seeing two men but two persons who love each other together. It's a slow but significant progress, making 'Milk' one of the most important films of the 2000's.'Milk' is about both an evolution and a revolution. Told in a flashback narrative from Harvey Milk's tape recorded testimony, it's the story of his combat that put the gay movement in America's political map. It starts with disturbing opening credits, depicting the intolerant America of the 50's-60's, when homosexuals were victims of constant witch hunts orchestrated by the Police, basically the 'closet' era. At the end, while the fight was not over, there was a sense of pride, unity and affirmation of the community as a political force. It starts with Sean Penn an ordinary average-looking Wall Street agent who just turns 40 and complains to his new lover Scotty (James Franco) that he never accomplished anything in his life. At the end, Milk is revered as the leader, the incarnation, the pioneer and unfortunately, the true martyr of the LGBT movement in its fight for tolerance and equality of rights. So many changes in 8 years  'I need a change', says determinedly Harvey to Scotty, before they move to San Francisco in the iconic Castro district. Milk opens a camera shop then creates the 'Castro Valley Association of Local Merchants', an entity with a growing political influence earning him the title of 'Mayor of Castro Street'. The film has an undeniable informative value that helps you to understand the roots and ascension of the gay movement. When Milk abandons his hippie look for a more politically convenient appearance, this is a pivotal point. There's a progressive cohesion in the gay movement starting from its core, with a scene-stealing performance from Emile Hirsch as 'the so adorable' Cleve Jones. Gus Van Sant's intimate direction is crucial for two reasons. First, it's an efficient empathy builder: I shared the enthusiasm, the paranoid feeling of the dark deserted streets and sometimes the surprises, like when Alison Pill as Anne Kronenberg came up, I had the same 'hey, it's a girl!' reaction. The second reason, more serious, implies another female character, the infamous Anita Bryant.I reckon I used to be skeptical regarding the gay movement. For me, one could say: 'I'm a worker, farmer, teacher, mother etc.' meaning to be politically and socially defined on a productive activity's basis, which excludes sex. But Anita Bryant and the anti-gay policies proved the fallaciousness of my reasoning. The Proposition 6, from the notorious homophobic Senator Briggs, totally disregarded homosexuals' privacy, by giving the right to fire gay and lesbian school teachers, a dangerous measure that would have normalized homophobia. Proposition 6 came at a crucial moment, when Harvey Milk, thanks to the new voting system by district, became the first openly gay Supervisor elected to a political office. The only response to this attack of privacy was a proud affirmation of this very privacy, as the essence of the gay movement in reaction to the closet : the symbol of oppression, which in the best case, allowed 'instutionalized' gay activists just to endorse straight candidates.And this pride is efficiently conveyed through Dustin Lance Black's Oscar winning script, whose spiciest line, stuck in my memory, is Milk's priceless reply to a remark about men's procreation : 'God knows we're trying'. Surrounded, by a great cast of supporting characters, Penn embodies the sincerity and sensitivity of a man with his flaws, his mannerisms, his passion for opera, his touching self-derision and more than anything, a man of conviction, principles, and alas of premonitions. Milk, sadly, foresaw he wouldn't make it to 50, and knew he would be victim of an insecure person. The rest has been written in bloody letters by history, with Dan White as the pen. Josh Brolin, in a deserved Oscar-nominated performance, is a victim of his own prejudices, venting his frustration in the most cowardly way, by assassinating the mayor George Moscone and Harvey Milk. Milk who was not a political boy-scout either, he defended his interests as a true leader but whatever White's first intentions were, he proved to be a weak and dangerous man from his reaction while Milk proved to be a good man from his actions. And the scene of the assassination with this incredible brief 'no' upset me and I thought 'God, what a waste'.The powerful last sight of people walking in San Francisco's streets with candles was a heart-breaking moment. More than a gay activist, more than a political leader, these people were also mourning the loss of a good heart and a free spirit, two qualities illustrated by Penn's smile in the movie's poster.And beyond the inspirational story of Milk, the film still speaks for all the oppressed minorities in the world, where the fight for tolerance is not over yet",10,1,3,29 June 2011
The Prestige," 'The Prestige' starts well but cheats with its own premise...
","There are many kinds of magic: wizardry à la 'Harry Potter', illusions or hallucinations, or entertaining shows: mediums, rabbits in top-hats, women sawed in half, bag-content guessing, magic cards etc. Speaking of cards, Christopher Nolan's 'Prestige', made between two 'Batman' movies, lays its cards at the first voice-over monologue where we immediately recognize Michael Caine's smooth voice. It's about the third kind of magic and provides the three structural rules of an act: it starts with the Pledge: you show something normal then the Turn, you make it do something extraordinary... but there's an element of expectation and the higher your reputation goes, the more sophisticated the public. In fact, there's got to be something unpredictable, so it all comes down to the Prestige, the trick no one sees coming and will earn magicians applauses and guess what? prestige.Then, the least you can expect from the film is to follow these three rules even in the loosest possible way if it means wowing you with a spectacular surprise. And given that it's a Nolan film about the deadly art of illusion, much more opening with the killing of a magician, the imprisonment of his rival whom everything accuses, your twist-radar is set from the start, so not any twist will do. Whatever the prestige will be, if it's not venturing in the realm of feasibility, something will have been missed. We're dealing with magic after all, not fantasy, not sci-fi. I insist on the sci-fi element because the film opens with some electrical contraption that shakes its credibility from the start until a reassuring trap door shows and we can let a sight of relief go.French called electricity a Fairy so it all makes sense that magicians would use it as a device for generating illusion, just like rivals Edison and Tesla were perceived as wizards. After all, it's also established that magic is about what you see and what you don't and the use of lights and darkness is integral to the act. Still, I didn't like that machine. It felt incongruous and weird in a period drama and I was afraid Nolan would end up inserting some Batman-like device. And when he said in the 'making of' video that he wanted to portray magic according to his personal vision of film-making, I thought 'no kidding?', I'm pretty sure everyone got the parallel, especially when magical acts use special effects worthy of a Spielberg film. So Nolan gets a little carried away at the end while the first two acts of the movie had really gotten me involved, I mean the escalating rivalry between the two magicians Alfred Bowden (Christian Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and their attempts to destroy one's act or find one's secret. What Nolan got right is that the rivalry mostly works as a foil to plunge us in the world of magic and know all the tricks. After all, that's the greatest thrill about magic, seeing how it works. For instance, the way a magician puts a dove in a cage and then flattens it to magically making the dove reappear under a handkerchief always made me scratch my head... but in this Dickensian universe where there's no pity for little children, why should there for innocent animals?The trigger of the rivalry also helps to understand how one of the most famous magic tricks, the 'escape from the tank water' that made Houdini's reputation, is indirectly explained. Working as false audience members, Bowden and Angier are assigned to tie the magician's pretty assistant (Piper Perabo), one of them makes the kind of knot that doesn't leave any chance for the poor girl, who happens to be the other's wife. We gather that from then, it's personal. Another pivotal moment occurs when one conceives his masterpiece, an act that consists on getting in a door and coming out of another. He calls it 'The Transported Man', for us, it looks like teleportation and it justifies why the rival is devoured by jealousy, although Caine's character can only see one explanation: there must be a double.At that point of the review, it's impossible to go further without spoiling the film. It's engaging enough to make you forget there's a twist but it's not spoiling the film to say that there's a twist, since it's the essence of magic. You've got to wow the audience with a surprise at the end. With the seemingly death of a character right at the start of the film, the battle to know everyone's tricks and the existence of a double, anyone could reassemble the pieces of the puzzle. But you know Nolan has more than a trick in his sleeve and that's both a blessing and a curse. Granted anticipations are to be toyed a little to be emotionally rewarded, all he had to do was working on the narrative structure to make what we know first a more effective reveal or a shock.Instead of that, Nolan relied on a far fetched revelation combined with an implementation that destroyed the whole atmosphere built throughout the film. From the start, we follow magicians who are dedicated to their passion, which is good, but the escalation toward sadism and some ends-justifying-the-means means made their whole approach to their art debatable, leaving no room for sympathy. In this cruel battle of wits, women are reduced to disposable pawns (Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johannsen would get more dimensional roles in a certain Woody Allen's movie). The first two acts, we can call them 'pledges' and 'turns' are great but then the film goes downhill. One thing for sure, I hated that Tesla Machine, and no offense to David Bowie, but Tesla was quite a handsome fellow whom I doubt spoke with such a heavy British accent. Nolan wanted his film-making to echo magic, but he let the reverse thing operate.",7,3,4,25 May 2018
The Terminator," Fatality and Predestination or when running away can only be a temporary option
","Simply said, 'The Terminator' is a great film, and even greater when you watch it with the mindset of someone discovering it in 1984, a time when Arnold Schwarzenegger's career was still to be consolidated, when James Cameron wasn't yet that billion-ma'King of the world', when 'I'll be back' was still a quote that could be heard in any film without being associated to a bad-ass catchphrase with an Austrian accent, when Linda Hamilton still looked like a lovely doll begging for protective hugs.In 1984, moviegoers went to see an entertaining B-movie starring that Conan-the-Barbarian-guy whose speech pattern could hardly be taken seriously. Even the producers and director expected a backslash from the critics. Little did they know that they had just made a milestone almost as significant for the Sci-fi genre as 'Alien' five years before, and that their humility would be rewarded by a close-to-unanimous praise and a lightning propulsion into Pop- Culture. Arnie became THE ultimate action-movie icon, and the rest is no less legendary.And the reason the film works is its remarkable simplicity in each aspect. First of all, the plot : an Artificial Intelligence company named Skynet created such technologically advanced robots that they rebelled against humans and provoked a nuclear holocaust until they were almost defeated by the Rebel Chief John Connor. As a robot sent to kill his mother before he'd exist, Schwarzenegger appears at night, completely naked and takes some civilian clothes before tracking Sarah Connor. But we're in a basic Sci-fi movie and the villain calls for a hero, this is where Michael Biehn intervenes, he looks strong but he's not the alpha male muscular type, which eases the empathy process.His mission is to protect Sarah Connor and kill the Terminator, so running away can only be a temporary option. Yet if the villain ever inspires one thing, it is not to confront him. The Terminator doesn't know what Sarah Connor looks like, but that's not an issue, any Sarah Connor can potentially be John's mother and is terminated Skynet-style. The murders are straightforward and chilling. At first, the Police don't notice anything odd with that brutal murder, until a second Sarah Connor is gunned down. What kind of serial killer works by the name? Anyway, the most urgent is to protect any Sarah Connor living in L.A., including an adorable waitress, so far from that girl-power archetype from the sequel.And this is one of the film's beauties, the absolute contrast between the robotic killer and the harmless target. And this is where the casting pays off; Arnold Schwarzenegger was certainly criticized for the limitations of his acting range, especially at a time where his accent was stronger, but here, he's given a role that only an actor like him could have portrayed perfectly: a cold and implacable killing machine. The Terminator was nominated #22 villain in the American Film Institute, but he's not sadistic, nor vicious, he's just programmed that way, which is why he's so scary. He's like a steamroller of brutality that will ignore every obstacle until it gets him to Sarah Connor.And the film wouldn't have worked had Linda Hamilton looked or played it like Ellen Ripley in 'Alien', Obviously, a woman like Sarah Connor needs a protection whether from the cops or from Biehn, and some bits of luck that will prevent her from the fatal encounter. Indeed, when the Terminator realizes he didn't kill the right woman although she lived in Sarah's house, begins a breathtaking, spellbinding cat-and-mouse chase. There are shootouts, there are car chases, but they felt different because this time, the enemy doesn't try to get at them but to kill them, they're means as well as ends. The Terminator is an unstoppable death warrant, guided by fatality. Notice the scene when, for once, Sarah gets the illusion of being finally protected, in a commissariat. The Terminator's 'I'll be back', especially when heard for the first time, sums up everything, no matter how far away you try to push him, he'll get back to you.And this, resonates as the voice of fatality, the omen of an inevitable confrontation, something that neither Biehn nor Sarah can't avoid, the future has come to haunt them, and if Sarah is really the mother of a future fighter, even she will have to express that 'fighting' part of herself. Whether you look at the half-empty or half-full glass, you'll see 'Terminator' as a predestination or fatality movie. And I guess this is why the appellation neo-noir isn't gratuitous. Noir is about people who try to escape from a painful certainty but can only triumph over it by confronting it, at the cost of something precious such as their innocence, their optimism, their faith on life or humanity.And 'The Terminator' is mostly set at night, it features characters who hide from these robots that remind them the apocalyptic future they carry on their hands, their own responsibility. Of course, bonds ought to be made and we have some clues that the predestination thing will provide some curious loops that don't quite respect the orthodoxy of time travels. But the film isn't about time travels, it's about a sense of duty and responsibility. And in a way 'The Terminator', as a villain, is an inspiration for the heroes, as much as he must kill them no mater what, they have to resist and to defeat him at any costs, the measure of a great antagonist is the degree to which he allows the heroes to overcome their weaknesses.As a matter of fact, the whole trilogy invites humans to question their condition, from being masters to slaves of the technology, what you can control can control you, it's all up to us to take the control of our lives back. That's what Sarah Connor will do, and this is why she becomes such a great heroine, the perfect match for such a great villain.",9,3,3,14 July 2015
Hotel Rwanda," When carelessness kills faster than machetes, one good man emerged out to restore our faith in mankind...
","I believe in goodness, I don't know about any other Holy entity but if there's anything pure and eternal in this world, in this history we share for the better or the worse, it's definitely 'goodness'. In the same train of thoughts, I believe hatred is more devastating than any devils or divine wraths. Sorry if I sound too metaphysical but that's the emotional state 'Hotel Rwanda' left me in.The film was directed by Terry George ten years after the Rwanda massacre. At that time, most viewers knew the numbers but didn't take their full measure. Indeed, why do we insist so much on World War II lessons if no one cares about the last genocide of the twentieth century? Has the African setting something to do with it? Is Africa so connected in the international subconscious to poverty, famine and civil wars that there would never be enough corpses to make the world care? History seemed to proved this right.No one cared about the genocide and the genocide emerged out of that carelessness, that's its most tragic equation. The film is told from the perspective of a hotel manager who uses the 'Milles Collines' hotel to shelter refugees, protecting them from the Hutus who wish to settle a historical record with their 'enemies'. The man will witness savagery and horror from the view of a hotel balcony before walking among piles of dead bodies, but the toughest lesson of all would be that the victims weren't worth the help of Western countries and that obliviousness killed much faster than machetes.It's very ironical that it was the Belgian colony that sowed the seeds of the very racism between Hutus and Tutsis, they ruled by dividing before division would implode like a volcano of blood. In a necessary expositional scene, a journalist played by Joaquin Phoenix (who represents our POV) learns that Belgians made the Tutsis the privileged ones on the basis of their tallness, lighter features and even the size of their nostrils. Tutsis would indeed rule Hutus and have more than a few altercations, but in 1994, for any newcomer, these considerations were silly: the journalist sees two girls in the bar, one Hutu, one Tutsi, but they could be twins.The film doesn't hide the tacit responsibility of the European colonization and makes the absences of reactions from Western countries accessories to mass murders. The film doesn't point an accusing finger because facts speak for themselves, but it shows us the two sides of the same coin. Hutu and Tutsi living, working together, forming families and living in harmony and a radio program alimenting the hatred and asking the Hutu population to get out and 'cut the tall trees' or kill the 'cockroaches'. The word is used so many times that we almost get used to it.And naturally, these ugly terms of reference have a strong resonance and remind us of the darkest hours. And it's a credit to the film's central character to have been capable to save so many lives with so little help, the UN contribution was acknowledged through the character of Nick Nolte, a UN peacekeeper left powerless when there was no peace to maintain but who knew when it's necessary to show a gun. But let's get back to the film's hero, because he's a hero. The man is a Hutu, Paul Rusasebegina (Don Cheadle) and married to a Tutsi Tatiana (Sophie Okonedo) and together they have children.Their chances of survival are thin but Paul, once abandoned by his Belgian bosses, knew he couldn't make profits because it meant betraying his family or buying their lives by selling others. Paul chose to jeopardize his life and his family's to save a thousands of Tutsi refugees from the altar of ethnocentric madness, using his hotel as a true oasis of peace. What was a publicity stunt became a reality of 'matter and death' significance just like the factory in 'Schindler's List' and it's true the film borrows a lot of elements in he narrative but there's a singular difference.Indeed, Paul is directly concerned by the tragedy and the hotel is only a temporary situation and he knows it, at any time, the army can come, rebels can attack and his refugees massacred, Paul has no help but only time and skills. And this is what makes the film so riveting: to see this man who's only a civilian, uses what he knows best as a hotel manager to handle the most life-threatening situations. He needs ten minutes to put on a suit and these ten minutes are used to save hundreds of refugee, all it takes is to serve the guests a beer, to be a hotel manager, patient, polite, well-dressed, aware that war makes many profiteers and carpet baggers and you can make business with them.In a more painful scene where he's asked to shoot at his family, he manages to bargain lives in exchange of money. Paul knows that for as long as he works as a manager and never loses his capability to negotiate, to bribe and even to blackmail with diplomacy, there might be a chance of survival.That's what 'Hotel Rwanda' is a character study with a horrific war in the backdrop. And it doesn't leave us much time to catch our breath, it's truly a powerful and emotional journey that makes you wish you'd never have to live such a tragedy with your own beloved ones.As Tatiana, Sophie Okonedo gives a magnificent performance of a mother who's always at the verge of a breakdown and yet keeps enough strength to protect her children, I could feel my heart pounding at the sight of her trembling body. And as Paul, Don Cheadle shines as a man whose best asset is his professionalism and self-control in the middle of chaos. And since I decided to deify goodness, I would call this man not a hero, but a Saint.",10,1,1,27 January 2019
The Hateful Eight," Tarantino Back to his (and America's) Roots : A Heartfelt Ten to 'The Hateful Eight'...
","Eight strangers, caught in the middle of a blizzard must share a cabin, time, stew and coffee. Everything oppose them, the one thing they got in common is that you can tell the actors had fun playing them, and you can build some of the best acting out of fun.Meeting in the stagecoach, you have John Ruth,a paranoid bounty hunter (Kurt Russell) handcuffed with a female black-eyed criminal, Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh) taken to Red Rock to be hanged. And you have a black Union veteran, Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) who also happens to be a bounty hunter with three dead men to carry to Red Rock, too much for his horse, rest in peace. The friendly two meet a Lost-Causer named Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins) who happens to be the future Sheriff of Red Rock and has good reasons to see the Yankee with a black eye (lousy pun, sorry).In the stagecoach stopover, you have Oswaldo Mobray, a suave Englishman (Tim Roth) who happens to be Red Rock's future executioner, Joe Gage (Michael Madsen), a cowboy who's going to visit his mother although his face screams 'desperado' more than 'mama's boy', General Smithers (Bruce Dern), a Confederate veteran with a grumpy menacing look and 'Bob', a Mexican worker (Damien Bashir) who took the place of the seemingly absent owners, much to Warren's surprise, as he's used to stop at Minnie's famous 'Haberdashery'. So, the least thing that can be said when all the characters are exposed, is that there are too many coincidences to suspend our disbelief, and maybe the two bounty hunters have good reasons to be suspicious.What follow is a fantastic behind-closed-doors (with nailed boards) mystery drama with as much anger, deceptions, lies and ugliness as in '12 Angry Men', 'Sleuth' and 'The Wild Bunch' combined, it even has the demographic relevance of Lumet's movie as the whole cast incarnates the entire post-Civil War nation in microcosm. What a great movie finally.I say 'finally' because, in all honesty, when I learned that Tarantino was making another Western, with a title à la 'Dirty Dozen' and 'Magnificent Seven', I thought it would be another 60's-70's B-movie's remake with some score-recycling and revenge-fantasy plot, that would again appeal on the basis that the director-can-never-go-wrong.But this time, he didn't, and I don't even know where to start, but I'll try to make it through eight points, after all, eight is the fetish-number and it's like Quentin Tarantino's '8½' with all the references made to his previous work, well, the film feels like Tarantino, BACK TO HIS ROOTS and that's for the first strength.2/ THE SLOW PACING isn't just the usual quiet-before-storm stuff, the film leaves room (literally) for a few seemingly-friendly exchanges that feel like exposition (well they are) but they put you at ease, you know it will pay-off, in a bloody way, but you actually enjoy the long conversations the film features independently from the plot.3/ TWO STAND-OUT PERFORMANCES: despite the slow placing, there are the usual angry tirades and eloquent storytelling but the quieter moments belong to some of the greatest actors' interactions Tarantino ever directed and on that level, Jennifer Jason Leigh, deservedly Oscar-nominated, and Walton Goggins really stole the show, which is saying a lot.4/ UNRELIABILITY: basically, you don't know who's the good or bad guy. Think about it, all the previous films had clearly established villains (although charismatic) and heroes (although flawed). 'The Hateful Eight' strikes by the fact that you never quite know whom to trust, or to believe. Is the story a lie? Is the letter a fake? Is Minnie absent? We're back to 'Reservoir Dogs' claustrophobic entrapment enhanced by that ugly blizzard going outside as a dark comedy running gag.5/ VULNERABILITY: There's nothing, no status, no strength, that makes anyone immune to bullets. The violence strikes everyone in its blindest, ugliest and most surprising way, and it's precisely because Tarantino puts some slow and talky moments in the right places that the outbursts of violence really take you off-guard and you never really see them coming, while in his previous movies, where it was all about the good guy taking his revenge, we had a sort of cinematic instinct telling us when it was going to get ugly.6/ INTELLIGENT SUBVERSION: the film was panned as misogynistic. I think the treatment Domergue got spoke loud statements about the danger she incarnated and that 'embiggened' her aura more than anything. No offense to the Girl-Power trend that affected the action genre with 'Star Wars' and 'Mad Max' but I found the two most interesting portrayals of female protagonists in movies this yeas were Jennifer Jason Leigh as Domergue, and Emily Blunt in 'Sicario', and both happened to be violent yet stylishly realistic and pervert movies.7/ A BEAUTIFUL CINEMATOGRAPHY 8/ IL MAESTRO: an original score by Ennio Morricone, which shows that, for once, Tarantino took his material more maturely and seriously than usual, though some bits were originally made (but not used) for Carpenter's 'The Thing', one of the movies that inspired Tarantino, and you can tell, there's something personal in this movie, as it really feels 'different'.But this difference didn't meet the same acclaim than 'Basterds' or 'Django' and the screenplay wasn't even Oscar-nominated. It seems like people are more openly critical toward 'The Hateful Eight' than any other Tarantino movie, as if all of a sudden, the characters were too mean-spirited, and violence too much to handle, yet it was cool when it was against Nazis and slavers.For once that Tarantino doesn't go over a simplistic and intelligence-insulting good vs. evil antagonism, he becomes the bad guy, like they say, Nature hates emptiness. Well for 'The Hateful Eight', I give the 'bad guy' a heartfelt Ten.",10,24,55,27 February 2016
The Adventures of Tintin," A great adventure film for all the family. To be precise : a great family film for all the adventure...
","Steven Spielberg's 'Tintin and the Secret of the Unicorn' is an entertaining action-packed and mystery-filled adventure film that, beyond all these epithets, respects the spirit of Herge's adventures of Tintin, the classic worldwide famous, comic-book series, and take this from a fan who grew up reading the albums, rereading them in French and English, and watching the animated features. In seven words : Steven Spielberg made a great Tintin movie.Recently, I've been very critical toward Spielberg, but I knew he had a particular fondness on Tintin's stories, and you could tell by watching some of his films, the 'Indiana Jones' series to say the least, remember Short Round in 'Temple of Doom' who was inspired from Tintin's best friend Chang. Interestingly, Indy's profession as an archaeologist was as much as a convenient excuse for living exciting adventures as Tintin being a reporter (after all, we've never know for which newspaper he ever worked) but in this film, Tintin mentions his job several times, and his curiosity is less guided by a blind appetite for adventures than a strong and professionally oriented desire to know the secret of the Unicorn. Yes, he's an adventurer but his quest of the truth is what justifies the adventures, not the opposite. And the strength of the film is in its ability to be more a mystery than an adventure film.Now, I'd like to get to the point that would inspire most criticism from the fans, or let's say, the most purist of them. For intellectual honesty's sake, or in the name of this Tintin-esque quest for the truth, I know some aspects will bother the hardcore fans. In fact, as it often happens for movies adapted from comic books, the story is a combination of many plots devices extracted from different albums. The problem is that the 'Secret of the Unicorn' is only the first opus of a two-part story, the second being 'Red Rachkam Treasure', which happens to be one of the most exciting and escapist of all Tintin's adventures, one of the funniest, and MY personal favorite. I was so impressed by the film that I wanted it to be followed by a sequel set overseas. But Spielberg chose to combine the story with the 'Golden Crab Claws', the famous album where Tintin meets Captain Archibald Haddock.The idea per se, isn't a blasphemy as long as it respects the spirit of 'Tintin' stories, to those who remember the other Tintin films, many of them took shortcuts with the albums, while some of them, were based on original screenplays and not faithful to that unique ambiance exuded from the iconic comic-book series. Spielberg tactfully used the greatest elements of both albums with the redemption of Captain Haddock, turning from a drunken loser in the beginning to the proud, larger than life and ferocious descendant of the Knight François de Hadoque, famous for his epic outbursts of rage, his thundering typhoons and other blistering barnacles. As soon as Haddock makes his entrance, the movie takes a new dimension, with the growing complicity between the two characters as a heart-warming core.Still, I can't help but feel frustrated for the underuse of 'Red Rackam Treasure', which would have made one hell of a story. Especially for the whole twist that concludes the adventure, Spielberg's 'Secret of the Unicorn' is less a treasure hunt than a treasure secret hunt so  why not make a sequel with the actual treasure hunt? Well, I try to reassure myself figuring that Spielberg might do another film involving seven crystal balls, Incas, or a red and white rocket flying to the moon, who knows? Or maybe he wanted the story that introduces Haddock, but 'Red Rackham''s introduces us to Professor Cuthbert Calculus, who'd have been a better comic relief than Snowy or Thompson and Thomson. But let's no be so purist, comic-books have codes that movies don't have and vice versa, a director, and a Tintinologist like Spielberg is allowed to take some distances.So, even, if the movie flirts sometimes with fantasy, or create many dizzying and exhilarating sequences begging for a 3D version, everything would have been pointless without the constant respect toward Herge's legacy. I appreciated that the film was clearly set in the 40's, which provides the perfect mood for such noir and exotic-set adventures, as much as I love the dazzling cinematography, and the inspirational message of the film. At the end, adults were thrilled, the Tintin fans were trying to recognize the subtle hints of other adventures, including a nice cameo-homage of Herge (will you catch him?), the non fans were enjoying a nice film, and children were laughing at the more slapstick parts, and Tintin's adventures had their shares of slapstick too. Not that it was funny every time, but there was the perfect dosage between action, fun, and remembrance of how great Tintin's comics have always been.So, I'd like to thank Spielberg for having finally fulfilled his long-life dream. Now, we can finally say that Spielberg made a Tintin movie, which was the greatest reconciliation between two arts that seem to only unite for super heroic films. Tintin is another kind of hero, many will find him bland or asexual but this have always been Tintin's personality, a sort of idealistic exaltation of youth's adventurous spirit, but whatever 'boring' you'd fin in that Yin, you have the Yang in Captain Haddock's colorful personality, and both contribute to one of the greatest dynamics that structure the film. The facial expressions are extraordinarily made, conveying Herge's particular 'clear line' style  they were drawn differently, but you could tell it was Tintin, Haddock and Snowy, on a pure technical achievement, the story is a success.But on the field of storytelling, of thrills, and excitement, the film is a triumph that will delight the hearts of all the fans from 7 to 77.",9,3,9,30 October 2011
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Great entertainment, but it could have been perfect ...
","If my review was a medical diagnosis, I would say 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' suffers from a benign case of cinematic schizophrenia, just as if 'The Sting' featured a scene similar to the tollbooth massacre in 'The Godfather'.As much as I genuinely enjoyed 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid', I had the strange feeling the film was constantly hesitating between two different approaches : comedy or drama, and if only had the director, George Roy Hill made a choice in both, the movie would've been perfect. And here is the first dilemma: as a comedy, it features some of the funniest lines and exchanges from American Cinema, which made the friendship more appealing in its comical aspect, and didn't fit the courses of dramatic events that would lead to the heroes' demise. While 'The Wild Bunch' was a dramatic friendship story, 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' had to be a buddy movie.My mention of Peckipah's iconic and superior film is not fortuitous. It has a lot in common with 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' as both film embody the agony of the Old West myth through the introductions of new vehicles such as the car for the 'bunch' and the bicycle for the 'Butch', and the similar plot lines featuring tough guys running away, whether it's from a bunch of bounty hunters or a posse, the escape is like a symbolic exile, when the civilization has conquered the west and the only valuable direction is the South, Mexico or Bolivia  countries not contaminated by the progress, where the vestiges of the Old West still remain, where banks can still be robbed.The modern take on the Western genre is not without a bit of nostalgia, on which the use of sepia in both films is the most eloquent expression. However, western is a difficult genre to handle and probably the less compatible with the genre-binding approach. You can amplify its effects, as did Sergio Leone, increase its level of violence like Sam Peckinpah, transcend its ugliness to a hypnotic documentary-like realism like Altman with 'McCabe & Mrs. Miller' or turning it into a sweet enchanting romantic comedy with self-derision as the best way to translate the way of old west frontier idealism, like 'The Ballad of Cable Hogue'. But as tempting as it is, you can't do everything and I felt like Hill wanted to try every tendency to stay on the safe side, and as a credit to his talent, it's a miracle that it didn't ruin the film.Although I admire the directorial job of George Roy Hill, I suspect the desire to do something modern was inspired from the current streaks of realistic films of the 'New Hollywood' era. I mentioned, 'Wild Bunch', 'The Graduate', 'Bonnie and Clyde' emulated in both the opening and the concluding scene. The last shootout was a deliberate way to keep a touch of realism in the film, reminding that guns needed to be loaded too. And the explosion during the bank robbery is one of the most convincing and spectacular from any film, even by today's standards. Now, how could such perfectionism have allowed the dramatic scene when they kill the Bandidos, the slow motion was ridiculously over the top, it didn't fit the film at all. And the film features many moments that shouldn't have been there. The script introduces us to funny or colorful characters like the News reader from the gang, or the scene-stealer Strother Martin, and the way they act label them as comic relief characters, and then they are instantly killed, in the coldest and most brutal way. The shocking effect made me feel cheated. The movie's mood had to be a cheerful comedy with some dramatic undertones, and the running gag involving the Woodcock character would never have me expected the film to turn in such a dramatic series. The movie had to be a Western 'Sting'.The film's modernity relies more efficiently on its spicy humor, and the great score from Burt Bacharach, which provide a smooth iconoclast, feel to a film. But I guess the movie finally grew on me, thanks to the great chemistry going between Paul Newman and Robert Redford, and how the two characters completed each other. The lines they exchange are priceless, and full of wit, the cliff scene, the Bolivia arrival, or the issues with Spanish languages were absolutely hysterical, the kind of humor all relying on timing and body languages and that creates the charm of such movies like 'The Graduate'. It's ironic that the movie features Katharine Ross, Ellen Robinson, again in the middle of a love triangle, but Etta Place, not the typical female action-killjoy, was the icing on the cake that provided the romantic touch and a reason for the delightful musical interludes, on the top of them, one of the film's defining moments, the bicycle ride.All the way, 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' is the perfect example of a great film that could have been even greater if the director stay focused on one specific tone. I learned in the commentary that Hill was surprised at Newman's lack of seriousness while playing Butch, but it was the right tone, how could you make a drama out of such an outstanding script. William Goldman's Oscar-winning screenplay is a comedic goldmine transcended by Newman and Redford's chemistry, a perfect comedy works on the body languages, the looks, at one point, there's one smile Redford gives, and never had a smile made me laugh so hard.'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' is redeemed by its wit, its beautiful cinematography by the master Conrad Hall, the score, the acting, and more than anything, its entertaining value. It's a classic, entertaining, Western but it could have been a masterpiece of unconventionality",8,0,1,11 August 2011
Moana," Let the girls be Moana... and the boys be moaning...
","And Now For Something... Completely... Identical! 'Moana' is a dazzling-looking story but to put it simply, it's not very interesting. The film is so obedient to all the recent trends that have defined Disney's movies that you can't find one little parcel of originality, it's basically 'The Little Mermaid' story retold in 'Lilo and Stitch' setting with a 'Pocahontas'-like character who's the same age than 'Brave' and driven by a 'Frozen' narrative. Oahu... Deja-Vu... and when a Hawaiian story leaves you cold, you know there's a problem.To give her deserved credit, Moana is a charming, adorable and strong-minded young preteen girl who has a lot to appeal to, but she's just too typical to strike as a fully developed Disney protagonist even when you try to ignore the trend. Once again, she's royalty, she happens to be the daughter's chief and her dream is to go sailing and discover the other side of the world. Yes, for some reasons later revealed but without being too satisfying, the entire village is stuck on the little island planting coconuts, eating coconuts and singing about how much they love coconuts. No problem, I love coconuts too. But I prefer fish.Some back-story is provided through another ominous legend about a mysterious heart being stolen from the local Goddess allowing a semi-god named Maui to create the human race, the animation was cool and didn't really cut-and-paste something from Disney movies but it still reminded me of 'Kung Fu Panda'... sorry, nothing new again. But even by accepting magic as an obligatory narrative trope in animated movies, I was wondering why is it that most girl-power movies must rely so much on the supernatural. Think about it, whether for Elsa, Moana or even Rey from 'Star Wars', there's always an element of magic that undermines the idea of a girl or a woman singlehandedly triumphing over the obstacles or despite her weaknesses. Minimizing the help of people or even animal sidekicks, these new trendy heroines most often rely on the assistance of magic, which doesn't really highlight their efforts or their merits. In 'Moana', the interference of magical waves or reincarnations or any superpowers from Maui are so numerous that the film loses its capability to thrill you, when you get used to these magic ex machina moment, you stop considering any danger a real threat, andthat's a threat for enjoyment.Now, I know the film is another instance of a movie teaching children, but especially girls, that they have to find themselves and have the courage to challenge unfair rules. Fair enough, but how can someone who's the 'chosen one' ever find herself? Basically, she'll have to find what she was chosen for. By trying to play on every possible safe side, the film never finds its places and ends up delivering more messages than Western Union. And these messages don't necessarily speak the truest statements about life, if you're going to convince children that everything is possible if you put your mind to it, you can't teach them that 'trying' is the most important thing. How about a Disney movie where 'failure' can be an option? At least, they can try that with a male character if they're afraid of some backlash.To be fair about the movie, I enjoyed the visuals, but we know it's the common denominator of most Disney movies, even 'Finding Dory' looked great, but the plot was rather thin. What's 'Moana' got to offer? Sure, I loved the immersion into Hawaiian culture and traditions. It's true Moana succeeds in giving us a Hawaiian flavor from the start but for the most part, the film is an adventure above the sea which isn't the most original setting, and apart from the traditional songs (nothing new since 'The Lion King') and the colorful look, we could have a movie set inside the island, giving much latitude to the Hawaiian tradition, instead of the usual 'native' narrative defined in terms of unfair tradition, relationship with Mother Nature and a young daughter who wants to challenge. To be honest, this has become a bit too predictable and the film can only follow the same series of patterns. It becomes all a matter of 'posture'.Dwayne the Rock Johnson and Auli'lCaravalho provide the voices of the heroic pair, and as much as I loved their work, especially some singing moments, I was wondering why the 'Marketing' was so insistent on their background? So Dwayne, a native Samoan dubs the voice of Maui, and Caravalho is a true native. But was Disney afraid of being accused of vocal white-washing? Did Johnson have a Hawaiian accent? And would have accent been accepted or criticized for being too stereotypical? I don't know but I guess it's just to prevent some criticism, and they were certainly right. The film didn't even escape from controversy when they launched the 'Moana' costume. But I guess it shows that no matter how critical we are toward the film, it reacts properly to the mood of its era.Now, I'm looking forward to discovering 'Coco'. Finally a movie about a boy! Sorry, but since Disney is supposed to awaken an inner child, mine happens to be a boy and maybe this girl-power stuff is making the boy inside me feel more insecure or jealous. So I don't mind a girl power movie once in a while but in that case, I wish Disney could... let it go!",7,2,3,22 December 2017
Crash," A controversial Best Picture win but a deserved one nonetheless.
","'Munich', 'Capote', 'Good Night and Good Luck' and the favorite 'Brokeback Mountain' were all great and daring movies but they never challenged cinematic conventions the way Paul Haggis' passion-project did. His 'Crash' defies tropes and genres not in a politically but also socially incorrect way, through interlocking stories all set in the canvas of a post-September 11 Los Angeles. I had said about Cassavetes' 'Faces' that it felt like a slap in our faces, 'Crash' doesn't just slap, it literally crashes reality into our faces.The title gives you the right idea by using the metaphor of the car, it is introduced by Don Cheadle's monologue about people needing a crash sometimes to get a sense of touch, to forget how remote they are one to another. This is the same L.A. Tom Cruise had just panned the same year in 'Collateral', a town of cold selfishness where cars eventually play a pivotal role in the way they make various intrusion possible, not all of them are providential of course. Indeed, either for a carjacking, a ride, a police control or a rescue, every action has its consequences, some tragic, some inspiring, some driven by the best intentions yet causing unfortunate collateral damages, and vice versa.Collateral, that word again. Not every intrusion has a cause or serve a point, most of them are accidental yet they have an effect, and the way each effect seems to make some statement about our humanity is a credit to the triumphant intelligence of Haggis' script. And since I don't want to spoil the film, I will only focus on one character, Matt Dillon as a LAPD officer. This is a man whose establishing moment consists on humiliating a black couple (Terrence Howard and Thandie Newton) during a control. In any lesser movie, such a despicable character would get a Karmic revenge. 'Crash' ironically makes him the most human. It all works by contrast, most characters dodge prejudices or racism while having them printed in their subconscious, Dillon's character doesn't cheat with his views.And that's 'Crash' power, it dares to challenge our perceptions of the ugliest symptoms of prejudice by showing us how deeply rooted they are in reality and experience, it's not beautiful but at least it's real. A rich white woman (Sandra Bullock) acts scared when crossing the path of two black kids on the pavement, what happens next actually proves her right and she even uses it as an 'I told you' argument to her husband (Brendan Fraser). Yet one of the carjackers is clearly not as ethically challenged as his partner and in the end, he's hitchhiked by Dillon's rookie police partner (Ryan Philippe) who was shocked by his colleagues' behavior and asked for a new assignment. What emerges from that encounter serves a painful but valuable lesson to anyone who believes his conscience is cleaner than everyone else's.Indeed, 'Crash' isn't about feelings, intentions or motives but plain actions, and reactions that translate themselves into action, and car crashes are the right metaphors for these revealing moments in our lives when we stop being trapped by our inhibitions. Consequently, so many brutal things happen that we might miss the little touches. Take the locksmith (Michael Pena), he's mistaken for a thug by both the rich white woman and the Iranian man who was insulted by a gun store owner who must have taken for an Arab. Yet Pena plays the least troublemaking character in the film, but even he isn't immune to danger or violent misunderstanding.The film isn't all dark and gritty and there a a few guardian angels here and there, which is appropriate in Los Angeles, but so many devilish vibes poison relationships between people who have so much in common. The Persian man is obviously worn-down by all the prejudice he might have suffered from and the irony is that it made him more unstable and threatening. Another irony is that some black characters use racism as an excuse to act no better than the oppressors they accuse. The film is full of ironies where people become attackers in the name of victimhood. And that did remind me of another urban drama classic.In a way, 'Crash' plays out like a 'Do The Right Thing' for the 2000s, with people doing the thing they think is right, allowing tragedy to burst out the most random and anticlimactic moments. In fact, it's not about doing the right or the bad thing, but the fact that some people we know to be good can commit reprehensible acts, and then you have Dillon's character first depicted as a hateful cop first but then a caring son to his ill father and a hero, this speaks a thousand words, and dig a thousand truths, many of them quite inconvenient for our mentalities.Yes, today, we live in a world or a culture of plain victimization, it's all about white vs. minorities, women vs. men etc. and the problem with 'Crash' is that it was set at a time where there was no smart phone, where most of these things wouldn't happen without someone immediately denouncing it, which is good in theory but who knows how disastrous the consequences can be when everything is shown in a binary black-or-white way. No need to get further; if there ever is one thing 'Crash' shows is that the accused ones can be victims and victims aren't always innocent.We all have public faces and backgrounds, some aspects of us are known, others are not, but we also don't know the real content of our characters until we're confronted to the most extreme situations like crashes or similar car encounters. 'Crash' is mostly about people learning about themselves, to be better. Today's world is too binary and obtuse, even accusing 'Crash' of being manipulative, and while I'm wondering how we could take so many step back, I'll always consider the film a humanistic masterpiece",10,1,1,28 January 2019
Snatch," Reservoir Shaggy-Dogs...
","'Snatch.': the tale of a stolen diamond, unlicensed boxing games, a promoter with the most peculiar hobby consisting on feeding his pigs with his enemies or debtors, and Irish travelers with caravans and accents as impenetrable as the plot that tries to tie all these elements together. Oh, did I forget there's also a little dog that can swallow everything, from a squeaking toy to... a more valuable item. Well, I think this dog is the living metaphor of whatever Guy Ritchie expect from us, viewers: to swallow anything, as long as it is funny. In fact, the film is quite funny, with a few outbursts of sheer comedic genius, but it's not as easily digestible as Ritchie's 1998 hit: 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels'.Guy Ritchie has been accused of exercising in style with his second film, but he could also give the Hitchcock answer about style being only another name for self-plagiarism. And he wouldn't be totally wrong because 'Snatch.' can be looked as a plagiarism in tone and story structure of his 1998 hit film, same assortment of characters with colorful nicknames, same intertwined plots, same use of frenetic editing, slow, fast or stop motions, Jason Statham, Vinnie Jones and Tom Ford reprising different roles and a screenplay loaded of one-liners, quirks and wisecracks, though not as memorable as the first.So accusing Ritchie of the whole 'style over substance' isn't just pointless, it's unfair in the way he didn't attend to do anything substantial, his 'Snatch.' Is as much a joke as 'Lock Stock'.But he can't get away with this argument either, not totally. I saw the movie again and found myself amused most of the time, but never really riveted to the point that I would miss nothing from the film. It's like the style of Ritchie didn't allow the movie to bloom by itself, everything was more an excuse for a few throwaway gags and the character were only the foils of a deliriously intricate plot. A comedy where the focus is the story can afford slower moments, in the case of Ritchie's movies, it depends on who's on the screen and on that level, there are three characters steal the show.Vinnie Jones, as Bullet Tooth Tony, provides a monologue that almost equals Dirty Harry's description of a Magnum, and with the same intimidating effect, Tom Ford as the nasty-looking bespectacled Brick Top is quite convincing as someone to make you curse your mother for giving you birth if you ever owed his money and Brad Pitt overplays his mumbling accent as if he was conscious that the whole thing didn't even need to be clear, a stunt that reminded me of Benicio Del Toro in 'The Usual Suspects'. That his 'Mickey' would make an accent worst than the cockney slang they used is a great running gag by itself, that with his extraordinary punching skills. Not to mention that Brad Pitt looked great, and you could tell, he still had the 'Fight Club' look.Benicio Del Toro is another asset of the film, making a hilarious entrance as a pseudo Rabbi with an interesting lecture about the Virgin Mary... wait a minute, black-clad men walking together talking about 'Virgin'? A feeling of déjà-vu deepens. Anyway, Del Toro was great as Frank Four Fingers but wasted too soon. I guess he had to work for the movie that would earn him the Oscar the same year, the more serious 'Traffic'. The film has so many great and inventive characters, Cousin Avi (Dennis Farina) or Boris the Blade that not all of them have a real shining moment. Even Statham who has such amazing lines as 'Turkish' in his first scenes becomes the passive observer he was in 'Lock'. Characters seem like the rather interchangeable elements of a plot too sophisticated for its own good. Even the build-up with unlicensed boxing games doesn't lead to a really satisfying resolution.Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the film for the most part of it, but thinking about it again, I'm wondering if it's not the sort of experience you can have as well by watching the best parts on Youtube. Ritchie rearranges all the moments like many clips of a parody series, and while it worked in 'Lock, Stock' because it had a common thread, a major story-line... even the seemingly disjointed 'Reservoir Dogs' had a plot. In 'Snatch.', everyone is important enough for the story but not enough so that we care, it's funny and entertaining, but the film lacks structure. It is possible that Ritchie wanted to replicate his formula, with an all-American cast, and that was enough a novelty but maybe the detractors wished it was less than a replica, and more a Desert-Point-Eagle-type of film.",7,1,2,14 June 2017
BlacKkKlansman," Racism as a convenient zone of psychological comfort... and film-making as a wake-up call...
","As a fan of Spike Lee, I know this review will sound awfully biased, but only to the extent that I'm preoccupied by the way intolerance infected many souls of civilization.Now, Spike Lee is not a political director but a director who cares for politics to the degree that politics care for people; ever since his 'Do The Right Thing' in 1989, he never made any secrets about his political inclinations, he sided with Clinton in 1992 less as a democrat than someone who thought Bush would be worse. So any attempt to trap his new 'BlacKkKlansman' within the 'Liberals vs. Conservatives' realm wouldn't solve the problem but only prove too well that it exists.The movie is a biopic, not the type to garner Oscar nominations (I do expect one for Best Screenplay though) but a biopic that cares for substance, for ideas rather than being your average crowd-pleaser. The acting never crosses the line of emotionality as Lee doesn't try to bait the Academy but only uses his artistry for a cautionary tale addressed to American (and maybe even European) societies. So, I shouldn't even talk about the Oscars, let's get to the real stuff.Ron Stallworth (John David Washington) is the first Afro-American to join the Colorado Springs Police Department. His first job in the archives makes him realize very quickly that bigotry runs in the Police, for some 'colleagues', it practically gallops given the terms of identifications they use to describe African-Americans. But that's only a foretaste on what's awaiting us, there's more than one racist rant in the film... so sensitive ears are warned.Still, Lee takes his time before getting to the point as we see Ron dealing first undercover assignment in a Black Panther meeting. Even as a fan , I was afraid the film might sound a bit too preachy for its own good. The speech made by the Black Panther leader, inviting students to love themselves, to accept their identity as black people instead of mimicking or trying to mix with the whites is powerful but visually, it might not be Lee's subtlest work... thankfully, it's not overused.Washington's acting is more notable in that scene: from his neutral expression, I couldn't tell how he actually felt about Corey Hawkins' speech. This is a man who endures racism on a daily basis but chose to join the Police Force, he looks sincere enough in his approving nods, but not so much to raise his fist and join their enthusiastic 'Black Power' chant. This is a real masterful portrayal of a character literally sitting on two chairs, and by his own admittance a few scenes later, who must live with two people inside his head.Now, to get back to Lee's work, the meeting sequence is important for two precise pay-offs: Ron meets female militant Patrice (Laura Harrier) and together they become good friends and have the most interesting conversation (and I don't mean that loosely). And then later when he joins the KKK, we have enough intellectual material to draw parallels between the way Black people picture themselves and the way they're looked at. It is important to have that glimpse before getting to the other side.Now, I'd rather not get into too much details about Ron infiltrating the KKK, because it's a terrific undercover story with fun novelties. First of all, it's pure curiosity that drove Ron into making contact with the 'Organization', if even they can print an ad in the newspaper, maybe there's something rotten going on and that is worth making a phone call and see where this leads to. The second novelty is that there are two cops in the mission, it's Adam Driver as Flip Zimmermann who must pass as the 'man behind the voice': white all right, but Jewish.Spike Lee has often been accused for his portrayal of Jewish characters (especially 'Mo' Better Blues') or his vocal concerns about the double standards between Blacks and Jews. But I think that was an unfair trial that gave him bad publicity and stained his reputation, critic Gene Siskel (of Jewish ancestry) considered Lee was in his right to express his own views. Besides, Lee doesn't hierarchize hatreds but shows them as the ends of a same spectrum of hatred meant to last. Indeed, we hear nasty things in the film but not much worse from what we hear in any Internet comments against Blacks, Jews, Gays, Arabs etc.And Lee exposes an interesting theory connecting the film's context with the rise of racism to a certain presidency today, and that might not content a few supporters. But before one accuses Lee of being some 'liberal midget', one should also look at the last five minutes of the film and consider the recent tragedy in Pittsburgh.One more thing, I remember during the Caramail days, I used to register in different identities and have fun feigning being racist toward my own 'kind' in order to elicit a reaction from the 'other side'. Why it was fun I don't know, maybe because it showed that people are maybe racist to be in a sort of psychological zone of comfort or self-defense machanism, what better than believing that you belong to the right side, after all?But the film shows the dramatic catch of rubbing people's hearts in the right direction. Spike Lee hasn't just a stance against a political leader but also a certain movie I felt sorry for praising its iconic value: 'The Birth of a Nation'. There's a powerful cameo of Harry Belafonte telling a story of some savage lynching that occurred as a reaction to that movie screening, and it's just reminded (and I'm not making comparisons) of the Twitter reactions against Arabs after the release of 'American Sniper'.Maybe it says something about the responsibility of Cinema as an Art, and maybe the film was made because Lee felt responsible enough... to remind us that history has a tendency to repeat itself. Let's just hope future proves him wrong!",9,14,30,4 November 2018
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," War's seriousness sacrificed in the altar of hilarious absurdity ...
","It was a time that probably most of the users who reviewed 'Dr. Strangelove' didn't know or were too young to remember, a time where the fate of humanity was hanging by a thread.The nuclear scare was a reality that history proved to be the radical solution to any political inconvenience. And at this very time where the atom could annihilate life and civilization, when the two blocks on both sides of the iron curtain had the nuclear weapon ready to be used, any human being could have legitimate reasons to look at the future with fatalistic eyes. This paranoid state lasted during almost one decade reaching its paroxysm with the Cuban Missile Crisis. Legend has it that the Soviets had indeed a nuclear weapon aimed to destroy the world in an extreme case. Anyway, the Cuba crisis, had it escalated to a no-return point changing the temperature of the Cold War, could have meant the end of humanity, or in the best case, World War III. I needed to remind the context because it's still very hard to believe that all these elements inspired one of the funniest and most classic cinematic comedies. But I guess, it's no surprise that the only film-maker who has successfully gone through this challenge is the one and only: Stanley Kubrick.The first time I watched 'Dr. Strangelove', I had no idea about what to expect. I knew it was a political satire but having the iconic image of Major Kong riding the bomb in mind, I thought the movie would be inhabited by such goofiness, it would deviate it from the level of sophistication I expect from the Master. How wrong I was! If one thing, 'Dr. Strangelove' strikes by the seriousness of its humor. It's almost a psychological introspection into the ability of serious people to inspire our laughs. These are adult men, reasonable, moderately competent, who are confronted to a political crisis initiated by a lunatic Brigadier Jack Ripper. This man, between some solemn cigars' puffs, reveals the sacred mission he'd be entrusted with, preservation of precious body fluids. Sterling Hayden is so damn serious and believable, I admit I bought it. But when you go into the film in depth, a sentence that should be a motto with Kubrick's films, is there ever a reason not absurd enough to justify war? 'Dr. Strangelove' doesn't use absurdity for comedic purposes but more to denounce with subtlety, its eternal dichotomy with War, as the highest level of absurdity human mind ever reached. Could something be more absurd than fighting and destroying one population for the survival of another, when contrarily to animals who do it for survival, both can technically live in peace? Jack Ripper sets the tone that the rest of the film will never contradict. And it brought up one of the most classic ironical movie lines when the General 'Buck' Turgidson, a hysterically funny George C. Scott in an Oscar worthy comedic performance, violently confronts the Russian Ambassador: 'Gentlemen, you can't fight in here. This is the War Room', shouts an patronizing President Muffey. The Cold War is almost reduced to a bunch of adults fighting like kids. Indeed, all through the film, there is a disturbing feeling that war is playful and the political leaders are like playground monitors incapable of keeping the lowest instincts of their troops under control. 'War is too serious to be left to politicians' precisely because they simply can't handle their military troops, while the planes are going with 'Johnny Come Marching Home Again' as musical background. That's the irony of civilization, its excess can't handle the barbarity. The unforgettable Red Phone conversation is probably my favorite and funniest moment from the film. Muffey very casually tries to appease his Russian homologue as if they were talking of a simple incident, not something that would eradicate any trace of life on the surface of earth. Hilariously disturbing.This psychological element is omnipresent in Kubrick's as to insist on one of the very paradoxes of our species, our 'dehumanizing humanity': being so sophisticated, so powerful, so civilized that it alienates in the conviction that these accomplishments, science, power can be used to kill other people in the name of self-preservation. The iconic ending where 'Dr. Strangelove''s arm raises spasmodically as to make a Nazi gesture reminds that the Cold War carries the worst aspects of whatever World War II has taught us. The lesson hasn't been learned obviously, and the way, the psychotic Dr. Strangelove talks and seems to be listened with interest, would be tragic if it wasn't so damn funny. Of course, I couldn't go on without mentioning the genius of Peter Sellers, who managed to capture the absurd roots of evilness through Strangelove, while portraying the straight man as Muffey, the symbol of civilization's impotence. Not to forget, his performance as Captain Mandrake, the unsung hero who symbolizes the eternal struggle of well-intentioned men confronted to the threatening competence of evil people and the pointless competence of good ones 'You'll have to answer to the Coca Cola company' while the world is in danger. Certainly the role of a lifetime and Sellers is perfect in this, and should have won the Oscar  as usual, no respect from the peers, the only Kurbickian paradox that can't be explained.The ending of 'Dr. Strangelove' is the ultimate testimony of Kubrick's tremendous talent and capability to provide iconic images for cinematic posterity. Major Kong riding the apocalyptic bomb humanity is the powerful allegory of a world that lost it, and the moment is so hilarious, than it's better to think of the movie as a comedy, with its gags, its impeccable script rich of wonderful one-liners, and some hilarious characters' names that would've made the Marx Brothers proud ... and thank God that this is not real, without forgetting that it could have been, or that it could be",10,5,9,25 June 2011
The Bodyguard," One of the most emblematic romances of the 90's ...
","1992 left two romantic moments for cinematic posterity, both musically immortalized: the magic carpet ride in 'Aladdin' where 'A Whole New World' opened itself to Jasmine's dazzled eyes, and Kevin Costner protecting Whitney Houston from the riot that just interrupted her concert. While the song is never heard at that moment, we all visualize it with 'I Will Always Love You' playing in the background. That image of Houston in Costner's arms is one of the most defining of the romantic nineties, Houston's feet never touched the ground but her soul touched our hearts forever and even more after her untimely passing, last year.It's the mark of great movies to be able to capture the soul of a relationship by only using the simplicity of images and music: a film like 'Titanic' will always be remembered for the flying-over-the-boat moment and 'My Heart Will Go On', 'Ghost' for the pottery scene erotically conducted with the 'Unchained Melody', and 'Dirty Dancing' when Johnny gives Baby the time of her life after putting her off the corner, and so on and so forth. And whether the film is good or bad becomes almost pointless when it reaches such a classic status. Cinema is not a rational world you know, imagery, lyrics, music have their 'word' to say and sometimes it transcends any attempt of an objective reasoning.My tone is partly defensive because I'm aware of 'The Bodyguard''s reputation, I know that the film met with mixed to negative critics, that it was panned for its formulaic story, for the wooden performance of Kevin Costner, the eternal Razzie's scapegoat, and even Whitney Houston, didn't escape from criticism. 'The Bodyguard' would almost need a bodyguard of critic to reply to its harsh disapproval. But I believe a film is also to judge in retrospect, at the light of what it has become and what has generally become of Cinema for the years after. Take all the movies I mentioned, with the exception of 'Titanic', a few romances ever make it now to the top highest grossing films of the year. We thought the 90's to be 'cynical' but in comparison with the 2010's, it's the 60's.Today, most successful films are action blockbusters / Pixar / Marvel adventures' adaptations or successful franchises, the recipe for success is clearly established, and a film like 'The Bodyguard' wouldn't have necessarily worked or even been considered to be made. Take the script, written 20 years before the release (for Steve McQueen and Diana Ross as the leads): a former ex-Secret Service Agent is assigned to protect a pop star whose life is threatened by a stalker, the material is simple but it's only through the casting that Mick Jackson elevates it, by confronting two of the then most inevitable faces of show-business. Costner is Frank Farmer and Houston Rachel Marron, but we all know she's playing herself, like Ava Gardner in 'The Barefoot Contessa', she gets a role tailor-made for her, and a powerful testimony for the person, that she was.Marron is Houston, and vice versa, a diva whose talent and unique voice brought her on the top of the billboards and the kind of spotlight that unveils the darkest side of stardom. As Costner said in his eulogy: 'anyone could have played the leading man, but only Whitney Houston could have played that part'; in one sense, he was right, even a star like Madonna wouldn't have fit the film. She already played in movies, which would have damaged her credibility as a 'vulnerable' star. Houston showed enough strength to convince us as a diva (because she was one) but she was fragile enough to need a strong shoulder to put her head on. But Costner is wrong about himself, he always cherished lone-ranger roles, men who combined both competence and high morality, with a wound in his past, so only him or a younger Clint Eastwood could have made it work.And both Costner and Houston make it work. And the film never treats the interracial romance as if it was relevant to the story, but nevertheless it accentuates the gap between the two characters. He works in secrecy, she's a star, he takes his job in a no-nonsense way, she embraces celebrity with full arms, knowing that it's part of her competence to be available to the crowd of fans. These contradictions create many situations where they have to make the rules, to adapt to each other, but we know these scenes are only meant to make their chemistry grow slowly and surely until the romance finally blooms. The romance is convincing because it starts as respect, understanding, and empathy to the point of when it happens, we don't feel it contrived, but as natural, exhilarating and passionate as the song that defines it.Indeed, 'I Will Always Love You' is the darlings of Karaoke and the ultimate test in musical reality programs, and that's a credit to Whitney Houston's miraculous talent for having made both the opening and conclusion, such milestones in the world of music. It was Costner who picked the original Dolly Parton's song and suggested Houston should remake it. That fact alone proves that his casting was a blessing. 'The Bodyguard' is as great as a film can get in terms of impact, and music enhances it to an extraordinarily emotional level, being till now, the all-time best-selling soundtrack.Naturally, 'The Bodyguard' was nominated for every Razzie Award possible, but like I said for 'Mommie Dearest', some films stick in our mind, no matter how seemingly bad they are for some pompous critics, and that's the kind of achievement some 'greater' movies fail to achieve. The only difference is that I called 'Mommie Dearest' a guilty pleasure, while I don't feel so guilty for having enjoyed 'The Bodyguard'.",8,0,4,21 November 2013
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," All good things must come to an end...
","'Return of the Jedi' always struck me as the weakest of the trilogy but after the groundbreaking first opus and its spectacular sequel of Shakespearian undertones, I wonder if any third film wasn't deemed to be the lesser one anyways, if only be default. In many aspects, its status equals its chronological rank, but that doesn't say much. It is compared to masterpieces, it's nothing short of a masterpiece itself as far as sequels go, and it's still better than all the prequels put together. Still, I didn't like it at first.And I knew to which direction I could point an accusing finger: the Ewoks. I thought the film lost all its credibility with these cute cuddly creatures that look like a crossover between the CareBears and the Gremlins. I couldn't believe that the evil galactic army would be defeated by a fistful of rebels helped by tribal furry warriors. As a matter of fact, I had a hard time taking seriously all the grotesque creatures populating the film, especially in Jabba's territory. But what does 'to take seriously' mean anyway? I blamed so much Nolan for being so pompously dark in his film that I should only praise Lucas for not taking himself seriously, always finding the right balance between fun and gravity.This is a trilogy that miraculously appeals to children and grown-ups, adults become like children again marveled by the visuals while children can also appreciate the coming-of-age of Luke. The film doesn't provide the visual space opera extravaganza and the action is mostly on the ground from the battles in Jabba's dungeon to the sand creature and finally, the chase sequence across the forest, but the whole texture is different. The first sequel was mostly made of black and white, the second is all in brown and green tones, it exudes more adventurous vibes and if the film had lost the epic scale of the previous battles, and the rebellion turned more into a form of guerrilla, it's a credit to Lucas for having renewed the material while still keeping faithful to the heart of the story.Everybody's still here, and when the film begins, with another iconic introduction, we feel like meeting friends again, and this time, it seems like the relationships are all set up. Leia is in love with Han, Luke isn't the boyish Jedi wannabe but a mature warrior waiting for his time to come. And even Darth Vader seems to have evolved from the ruthless evil Lord to the fallen hero under the spell of the evil Emperor (Ian McDiermid). There's richness in both the backgrounds, the effects, the characterizations and the plot, and all these elements converge to a spectacular confrontation that never reuses the same material. The light saber confrontation was unavoidable but Lucas find the little twist to make the scene memorable, and ever since, it inspired countless parodies.So, something happened that I didn't expect, watching the film again, I actually enjoyed it. And the enjoyment was driven by an experience that was nowhere like 'The Empire Strikes Back'. The first sequel completed the initiation of Luke Skywalker and deployed more visual effects than the original; it also introduced us to Master Yoda as the driving Force of Luke. But what 'Jedi' does is to reassemble all the pieces of the puzzle without giving that impression, and it took the exotic backdrop of the forest and the Ewoks' world to provide the film with its memorability stamp. But that still doesn't say why I suddenly enjoyed the film. Well, something changed in the Jabba's sequence.Jabba's voice and jargon and the translation from cowardly C3PO they made me feel this was a real language spoken and I had the exact same impression with the Ewoks. After all, isn't the film set in a galaxy, far far away, this is the best MacGuffin the film can have, anything is possible but Lucas find the way to make everything, if not believable, strangely plausible and maybe the mistake would have been to overlook these elements and keep it visually 'sci-fi'. I suspect George Lucas was a little carried away by the success of Indiana Jones and found the right way to differentiate 'Jedi'.And you can tell by the enthusiasm of Harrison Ford playing Han Solo, the little thing he does with his cheek when he smiles and his expressive eyebrow,s you can tell he has fun playing Han Solo, even when he's supposed to demonstrate anger. Ford injects a vitality and fun in the film that contrasts with the seriousness of Harmill; but even Harmill exudes a sense of maturity that confines to virile magnetism, something has changed in his eyes. As for Leia, she has her shining moment, and I'm not just talking about the bikini, but she's the one who defeats her ten-times her size Jabba, proof that girl power didn't wait for the Force to awaken. And at the end, Luke finally confronts his father and we get to have the inevitable unmasking moment, I wasn't sure I wanted to see Vader but ultimately, this was the film's highlight, after having bid farewell to Yoda, revealed the truth to Leia, he can watch his father one last time and his tender smile was perhaps his best acting in the trilogy, the proof that there was more than space opera in the film, it was also a Shakespearian father-and-son tragedy, there's 'Star Wars' and there's 'The Godfather', Michael Corleone and Anakin Skywalker, the most fascinating characters' arcs of Cinema's history.With this film, Lucas makes history again, closing the greatest trilogy of all time, scale and tone wise. The celebration at the end strikes for its anticlimactic and modest setting but it is comforting and emotionally rewarding, six years have passed since the first films, these characters evolved and became part of American myth and Cinema itself wouldn't be the same, forever.",8,0,1,7 October 2016
MASH," Suicide is Painless ... MASH is pointless ...
","(singing) 'I tried but failed to care for MASH ... a film I'm fool enough to bash ... but I need to say on the net ... the only big point I could get ... Suicide is painless, it brings on many changes and I can make or leave it if I please' I tried, I really tried to find out the secret appeal of Robert Altman's 'MASH', to approach its comedic aspect in the most impartial way  and frankly, the best compliment I can make is that it's an okay film but nothing special. I'm not familiar with the TV series but I'm sure it can't be worse than the original film. I feel guilty to write this way, maybe I should give it another chance, but the scenes are still very fresh in my memory and as memorable as they are, they didn't impact me in a very positive way. Just because it's an anti-war film doesn't wait, what was that? Unless I'm missing something, the film portrays the camp as a playground with a bunch of grown men acting like pricks. As far as the movie is concerned, war has never been so fun and so sexy to watch. Well, if it's the theme the movie choose, I'm fine and I respect the director who made the perfect 'McCabe & Mrs. Miller' for that, but there's a problem: to find something fun from one character's perspective, I have to root for him and Hawkeye and his gang were far too mean-spirited to inspire me any ounce of sympathy.I tried, I tried to laugh at their jokes, but all I could see is a film made of little redundant episodes where a bunch of moronic bullies have all the chicks and the revenge on the guys they hate, and I have a problem with that since I always root unconsciously for the unlucky outsiders. Hawkeye and Co are meant to be the outsiders where they are the true winners of the films, they humiliate and beat Frank Burns (Robert Duvall) just because he's a religious bigot, and Duvall is such an immense actor that he succeeds in deviating the effect of a manipulative script that was probably supposed to make him look even worse. Sure, they're soldiers and doctors, so it gives them an incredible sex-appeal but if the film is renowned for its political incorrectness with sex as a convenient ingredient, the way it depicted women as regular sexual trophies upset me so much, I didn't want to sympathize with the main characters, and the only female character I could root for was Major 'Hot Lips'.And this is my biggest problem with the film, this woman was humiliated more than once, with a microphone while kissing Frank Burns, she's exposed, totally naked in front of all the soldiers (and I guess even the women were supposed to cheer for that humiliation), she tried to establish her strong and strict personality and despite everything, she remained a strong 'straight-man' among a bunch of clowns. And then all of a sudden, during the football game, she acts like a dumb chief cheerleader told to 'shut up'. What the hell was that? How could her character evolve like this? Are we supposed to guess that the guys domesticated Major 'Hot Lips' reducing her to their vision of the perfect woman? And is that supposed to be funny?'MASH' has the appeal of a mean-spirited Benny Hill show, and it portrays a group of unlikable guys with so much indulgence that I could have accepted it as the 'artistic license of a gutsy director' but I didn't expect the evolution of Major Hot Lips, which I thought looked like a sort of fantasy from a male screenwriter who spent so much time in War he ended up knowing nothing about women. Now, I see some voices shouting : absurdity, Anti-Vietnam, 'missing the point', I love these words and I wish I could have used them in my review, but I don't think the movie invites the viewer to take it seriously, it's absurd, and there's intelligence in absurdity only if it serves to demonstrates something that is not absurd. In MASH, in the best case it was absurd for the sake of absurdity and in the worst case, it was a disgraceful comedy with some scenes that weren't even funny.I tried not to get annoyed by Hawkeye's tiresome whistling, to forgive the part where two soldiers randomly fights in the beginning, or to appreciate the sight of wounded soldiers as a solid dramatic counterpart but I don't think you can shortcut emotions this way, I didn't feel it was handled as to make you understand the whole 'war is hell' equation, so whatever greatness relied on MASH and that earned it so many Oscar nominations including one for best Picture and a Golden Palm, I failed to appreciate it. My mistake  I guess I prefer another thought-provoking Anti-war story with more comedic value and made the same year, an underrated gem named 'Little Big Man'However, the only positive thing that I concede from the film is the song 'Suicide is Painless' which was one of the most promising starts from any film and one song I rank among my all-time favorite. I have nothing against 'MASH' and I can see how it's a pioneer film in terms of political incorrectness, maybe I would have liked it more if it wasn't regarded as such a masterpiece but as far as the story and the characters are concerned, I don't find anything special  or that hasn't aged badly. So I'll respect the achievement of the film and give it a 7 before giving it another chance  sometime  when I'll feel more at ease.'And you could do the same thing, if you please '",7,1,1,23 November 2011
Pan's Labyrinth," There was Disney, then Cocteau and finally Del Toro!
","I remember these Sunday afternoons in the early 90s where movie versions of classic Grim tales were aired and I could tell from my parents' enjoyment that they were made for both an adult and a child audience. I still remember the 'Red Hot Riding Hood' movie and the nightmarish sight of the wolf posing as the sickly grandmother and whose face managed to fool the little girl.So It would be an unfair trial to accuse Disney of watering down fairy tales when you recall nightmarish moments such as the Evil Queen's metamorphosis, Pinocchio's friend turning into a donkey, Bambi's mother etc. Disney understood what made these stories from the Grimm Brothers and Perrault so vivid in our memories, begging to be translated into a visual language, Disney for children and Cocteau for adults proving there were more than fairies in fairy tales, they could be dark stories exuding wisdom and poetry.And then came the third (ram's?) head of the triumvirate, Guillermo Del Toro with his 'Pan's Labyrinth', a maze of a plot and a masterpiece that uses the basics of fairy tales: supernatural elements, fantastic creatures and coming-of-age story through an allegorical language that also ventures in the realms of politics while I was expecting something in the vein of 'Narnia' or 'Lord of the the Rings'. How misguided I was. This is is certainly one of the all-time greatest fantasy movies and original fairy tales.The reason why the film works so much is because it prepares you to venture in the realms of fantasy but it's the juxtaposition with a clearly defined historical period that marks its first intriguing novelty. Set in wartime during the fight between Franco's soldiers and rebels at the end of the civil war; it's that element of context that gives the story its full meaning.The parallel's relevance is highlighted by the contrast between that period and the narrated 'prologue' about a princess who disappeared from her kingdom, a world where 'no lies and pains' exists.We're plunged in a world that seems like the antithesis of that kingdom and while we wish for the princess' soul to get back to that world of her own, so many things happening in reality prevent us from envisioning any other alternate world as if reality was too cruel to make us believe in fairy tales. And Del Toro doesn't underestimate our intelligence, he knows we'll suspect the 11-year old girl Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) who reads the story, to be the potential chosen one, and while we're tempted to see the world from her child's perspective, we realize that the distinction between the real world and the fantasy isn't just stylistic but also narrative.This is more than 'Alice in Wonderland', what happens in reality escapes from Ofelia's attention as if it had a narrative relevance of its own and the monstrosity of the Pale Man for instance is nothing compared to what the main antagonist of the film has to offer. Indeed, Ofelia must clearly deal in the real world and above everything, her abusive adoptive father who impregnated her mother, a ruthless Captain named Vidal.Vidal is a soldier who lives by the fascist code and has only contempt for anyone below his rank: rebels, women, children. The man is blinded by his power, uses his patriarchy as a terror weapon but beyond his menacing aura, is capable to display bravery, considering death as the true measure of a man. Vidal doesn't prove that vileness lives with rules but that rules can be evil in the way they force blind obedience and lead to blind violence.Meanwhile, Ofelia must also follow rules and accomplish tasks that are not devoid of blood spillages. The tasks are given by a ram-headed creature, a Faun she met in the middle of an ancient labyrinth. And never question the validity of these tasks as if the 'fantasy' worlds had more legitimacy to call for obedience. It's until the second task where Ofelia meets the infamous Pale Man and refuses to follow an order that we understand the absolute value of obedience before it's questioned again in the final task.Once we start to draw parallels between Ofelia's journey and the war in the background, that we value her courage and the heroism of everyday fighters, a doctor, a servant against the ordinary tyranny of fascism and other institutions that sacrificed generations of Spanish people, that we anticipate with thrilled expectations the convergence between these two worlds. The final task wonderfully ties up the plot together in a parable of infinite wisdom, and whose use of violence is the best tribute to its maturity and intelligence.Indeed, I have always avoided the film because I heard about how disturbing it was and when I found the DVD, the 'beware violent scenes' made me expect the worst and I knew I had to be careful. But I was caught off-guard when the first disturbing scene happened. Many fantasy moments were repellent but they never equaled the violence reached by Vidal, played by a disturbing but effective Sergi Lopez.The film establishes the heights of horror and disgustingness reached by the two worlds and how it all comes down to simple issues 'should one follow his heart, his principles or follow blindly the rules?'. The film manages to raise such intelligent question by providing great insight about the horror of the Franco's regime and make us adults root for the adventure of a little girl, with a fairy tale that embraces the true essence of a genre too sugarcoated today.I have seen the film once but it touched me deeply through its visual, the little girl's performance, the haunting lullaby melody that I shall never forget. Or let's just put it simply, if as they say, a film is as good as its villain, then 'Pan's Labyrinth' is truly a masterpiece.",10,0,0,22 February 2019
Alien," Perhaps the film that best handles, tackles and tickles our most universal fears...
","'Alien'. A short word still resonating among movie lovers as one of the most frightening and nightmarish experiences ever, and deservedly so. Indeed, aren't our most common fears strangely connected to a possible alien presence? Why are we afraid of the dark, if not for the fear that something might touch us or jump at us? Why can't some people be alone? Fear of intruders. Agoraphobia? The anonymity of the crowd makes easier targets. Claustrophobia? Incapability to escape.Ridley Scott's 'Alien' intelligently explores these fears thanks to its brilliant concept, generally summed up as ''Jaws' in a spacecraft' and it does have a kinship with the no-less groundbreaking shark film. But the monster was in the water, so as menacing and oppressing as he was, you could just choose not to swim. This time, the monster is inside the spacecraft and the spacecraft is in space, it's a tricky situation where the monster won't go away and the protagonists can't either. And since the Alien's blood is a corrosive acid working like universal solvent, jettisoning him is the only option, impossible without a confrontation.But I'm already in the plot while there's more to appreciate than the monster and its effects. First of all, this is a serious film. Its aesthetic goals match 'Star Wars', the film that set new standards of excellence in art-set decorations. And the cast is believable and relatable, you have the veteran Captain played by Tom Skerrit, the more blue-collar executioners played by Yaphet Kotto and Harry Dean Stanton, executive (and so ill-fated) Kane, played by John Hurt, and the scientist named Ash (Ian Holm), the two female crew members are the young Veronica Cartwright and naturally Sigourney Weaver in her breakthrough performance as Ellen Ripley... and for a little touch of cuteness, there's little Jones, the cat. Like in another odyssey of the same year ('Apocalypse Now') Scott didn't try to put some bankable or glamorous actors in the story, they all look tough, worn-out, professionals, definitely not Hollywood material. You can feel the difference between 'Alien' and 'The Martian', Ridley Scott's last film where most crew members are young and fresh looking, starting with their leader played by Jessica Chastain. Chastain did fine in the film but wouldn't a woman like Ellen Ripley be more believable? (and Weaver was younger than Chastain in the film). 'Alien' is a film where the priority is the story and beyond the dazzling visual special effects, the film works because it never takes the easy way.A telling aspect of the film's quality is the slow pacing, it takes its time before each effect. We watch the crew waking up one by one from stasis after receiving a signal from the ship central computer MOTHER (is it an SOS or a warning?), they argue about going there. Parker invokes the need for extra-payment in case they make a detour as the mission is commercial and doesn't include any scientific requests. They eventually go to the wreck and discover the Aliens 'leathery eggs'. Then,an octopus-like creature breaks Kane's helmet and gets stuck to his head. The film picks off. And at that moment, Ripley stops being a crew member among many others, she raises her voice and insists on putting Kane in quarantine. She didn't even see the Alien that she already hates it (one of the series' endearing trademarks).Ash opens the door, much to Ripley's displeasure. The creature is in the spaceship, but it's still a matter of ten minutes before the most memorable part of the film happens but see how it's all set-up. Kane strangely recovers from his misadventure, so just when we took for granted he was dead, he gains consciousness back and we feel happy for him, a feeling making his demise even more atrocious. During the last meal, where we enjoy the last moment where they're all smiling, Kane starts having convulsions, and then some weird creature busts out of his chest, and what we get is one of the most iconic horror moments in history. The creature escapes letting the crew, and the viewers, shocked and stunned. And I wonder how film-goers must have felt in the theaters when the darkness made one with the ship's.'Alien' exploits its nightmarish feel to the fullest including the infamous tag-line: 'In Space, No One Can Hear You Scream'. And just when you think they might get information on how to get rid of the monster; Ripley learns from Ash that the creature is a priority while the crew is expendable. His description of the monster is just chilling 'a perfection only matched by his hostility' but reveals what Scott did with 'Alien', besides opening a series that would decline in quality, he created one of the most iconic monster villains of all time, embodying whatever we can fear: intruder, presence in the dark, not simply ugly but increasingly ugly appearance, and a total thirst for survival and destruction. The creature is so special that anyone who encounters him is paralyzed with fear or screams out of terror, this is the essence of evil. But all these effects would have been fruitless if Scott didn't also care for the casting, writing and directing. After all, we never really totally see the creature, just like in 'Jaws', the effects are there thanks to its suggested presence, POV and Jerry Goldsmith's score. And that's what Cinema is about, showing what is needed but making the unseen more effective. Just do the experience, you're be less scared if someone came into your house and made noise than if you were in your house and told that someone was there without you noticing it. It's a thin line, but it's the same that separates between action and suspense. The sequel would be a great action movie, the original is a masterpiece of suspense.",10,1,2,16 June 2016
Malcolm X," Intelligence as Self-Awareness, Self-Awareness as Self-Defense, Self-Defense as Violence ...
","'Do The Right Thing' ended with two quotations from Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X. According to King, no circumstances could justify the use of violence but Malcolm X qualified violence as 'intelligence' when in case of self-defense. Three years later, Spike Lee's biopic confirmed the bias he had toward the Muslim leader's opinion and through a masterstroke of writing, provided an insightful explanation on the 'violence/intelligence' controversial equation.Like Malcolm X, Spike Lee immediately inspires negative reactions, in his depiction of racial realities, but only truth hurts, and any form of thinking is subversive or is not. Rarely inclined to neutrality, Lee points his finger on the pervert aspect of American Society that tends to judge the hate before judging the hate that produces the hate. In other words, Lee provocatively invites you to think why the opening image of a burning American Flag, shocked you most than the sight of a KKK cross burning in front of a Black family house.Malcolm's family was destroyed by racism, from the roots. Malcolm's mother inherited a light skin from a white man who raped her mother and as a rejection to her 'shameful' genes; she married a Minister with darker complexion. Malcolm's father was killed by the KKK and then killed again, symbolically, when his widow couldn't benefit from his two life insurance policies because the death was considered a suicide. She ended in a mental hospital. These painful wounds in Malcolm's heart forged his determination and encouraged him less to hate than to challenge white men with their very weapons, except for education. Malcolm proved to have a brilliant inclination for studies, but was advised to look for a more manual work. Malcolm abandoned his dreams of accomplishment  through a regular job.The movie opens with an unexpected gangster feel where Malcolm, a youthful looking Denzel Washington, is a small time hoodlum in an elegant zoot suit, with his inseparable friend and occasional hairdresser, Shorty, played by Spike Lee, together, they drink, they dance and seduce white women. Shorty regularly applies a softening lotion on Malcolm's hair with an immediate burning effect. This running gag reinforces Malcolm's rejection of his condition as a black man and eagerness to imitate the enemy to outperform his. His reddish hair establishes some natural dispositions whose pinnacle is reached with the ultimate middle finger gesture to the system: the blonde. In a memorable scene, Malcolm asks his girl to kiss his feet. The macho power he exudes is so powerful she just can't say no, this is not a man degrading a woman, but a man raising himself to his personal vision of self-accomplishment.Malcolm still has the charisma of Spike Lee's street-wise characters; something needs to get him to the stature we know. The key is education. When Malcolm is arrested and spends seven years in jail, he's initiated by one of the 'Nation of Islam' followers. Malcolm embraces Islam and develop a passion for reading and knowledge, his glasses and shorter hair transfigures his rebirth as an intellectual figure. Beyond the tremendous performance of Denzel Washington, Lee's thought-provoking script portrays the vitality of education for the Black movement, an indirect way to point out that the segregation was maintained because white men kept black poor and ignorant. Violence was intelligence as self-defense because violence was awareness. 'We didn't land on Plymouth Rock, Plymouth Rock landed on us' The Black were not American because they didn't choose their destiny, their condition is the consequences of undesired actions, therefore, Black must take the lead of their destiny again. The price of this self-awareness was indeed a true hate against the White.In a short but significant scene, a young white woman asked Malcolm if she could do anything to his cause. Malcolm dryly replies 'no', leaving her totally embarrassed, as she felt, she was one of the White devils. As a follower of 'the honorable' Elijah Muhammad, remarkably played by Al Freeman Jr., Malcolm X's aura is stuck in the narrow walls of an orthodox sect-like organization. He studies more than anyone; he marries Betty, Angela Bassett in a powerful supporting role, founds a family, and dedicates his life to his cause. He starts to outshine the Master, and his own allegiance deteriorates when he learns about Elijah's accusation of fornication with his secretaries. Elijah justifying the actions as a God's prophet blasphemes the most sacred Islamic principle and reveals the alienation governing the Nation of Islam. After many ideological disagreements, Malcolm X quits and founds his own association. He signed his own death warrant by acting alone, but this is the great men's existential mark, the ability to act in total integrity.Through a pivotal pilgrimage to Mecca, he discovered that many cultures, colors of skins, and civilizations embraced Islam, and the Black vs. White antagonism became meaningless. At this point, maybe, Malcolm X understood that the fight, as necessary as it was, was only meant to restore pride and dignity to the African American. But Malcolm X was so blinded by a skin based antagonism that he didn't want to admit the possibility that he could be respected more by a white than a black man, or that a black man could kill him. History judged Malcolm X more harshly than Martin Luther King who was more a sort of Gandhi-like figure, but even King's peaceful nature didn't spare his life.King was a humanist, X was lucid, as carrying the light. His assassination didn't make him a martyr, but a legend whose pride speaks to all the black conscience in the world. 'I am Malcolm X' shouts school-kids at the end of the film while the tribute from Ossie Davis is heard, every African American carries the heritage of a man who didn't reject a country but injected a dignity, intelligence, a pride that transcended any form of religious beliefs.",10,5,11,24 August 2011
The Best Years of Our Lives," A poignant, realistic and inspirational take on the 'war veteran' trope...
","When Al Stephenson asks his children 'You've changed, what happened?', 'just four years of normal growth' says his daughter Peggy, kisses and joy ensue while this line is cooking in our head. Yes, one simple absence is liable to create shifts of misunderstanding even with your beloved ones. I have always said that besides love and respect, understanding was the underrated cement of relationships, 'The Best years of Our Lives' explore that issue through the intertwined post-war lives of three WW2 veterans.Fredric March is Al, a forty-something banker who comes back unwounded but fails to recognize his home, Peggy (Teresa Wright) grew up and gained such maturity she became a mother's substitute and his son has long abandoned the war's patriotic scope for more sensitive questions about the use of the Nuclear force. The housewife (Myrna Loy) is overwhelmed by Al's come-back but you can feel the tension, when the heat is over, Al feels entrapped and needs to celebrate his comeback anywhere but out of the house. That 'Going for a drink' excuse was subtly foreshadowed by the similar reluctance of Homer Parrish to meet his folks. Homer is perhaps the heart of the story, a sailor who lost his hands in duty but took it all in stride, minimizing the loss and being thanking the Navy for having taught him the use of his hooks. We're impressed by his ability to light a match and sign his name but as Al points out, they never taught him to take his fiancée in his arms and stroke her hair, though a better line could have been 'they didn't teach the family to handle them'.Homer's no fool, he notices her mother's sobbing gasp at the sight of the hooks and knows he's going to handle awkward guilt-driven demonstrations of love. As a result, he doesn't even talk about the marriage with his fiancée (Cathy O'Donnell) fearing she couldn't handle it, or maybe wishing she wouldn't. The irony of Homer, played with genuine intensity by Harold Russell, is that he doesn't want to be seen as a freak but is reminded of his handicap because he looks in people's eyes like in a mirror, or does he see his own reflection?And then there's Fred, Dana Andrews, he comes from a poorer neighborhood and his wife (Virginia Mayo) seemed to have left the house. She's obviously a 'tramp' and soon the pride and exaltation of having a dashing husband in his uniform leads to the disillusion of unemployment. Once a respected and brave captain, Fred becomes a soda jerk, a loser in the eyes of society and his wife, for what it's worth. Fred finds the needed comfort in Peggy, she can see that he's unhappy in marriage, likewise in society.Now that the most prevalent war veteran figure is the Vietnam vet who saw his best friend being blown to pieces in Nam, here's 1946 Best Picture, directed by ace director William Wyler, and reminding us that post-war isn't just all about PTSD, shell shock and dark memories, there are physical and emotional scars, but perhaps the toughest part of the job is to try to adjust yourself to a world that changed, before you realize you're the one who changed. 'Mudbound' handled that issue in 2017, and quite well.'The Best Years of Our Lives' centers on these three men's lives and their families in the generic town of Boone City. Each man represents a side effect of the war. Although it would be tempting to treat their arcs separately, I like the way the three of them tie the plot together and rather than speaking different statements about a subject, make a positive message converging toward its heart-warming conclusion, after almost three hours of a journey into the everyday lives of normal citizens.And this is what impressed me the most in Wyler's tone, he doesn't go for any sensational effect, or overuse of pathos, there's no forced drama or twists, the film is long because it has a certain desire to build solid and realistic bonds. In any other movie, the romance between Teresa Wright and Dana Andrews would look phony and contrived but the first day is as long as the wedding in 'The Godfather', you feel the realness of every interaction, and both Andrews or Wright seem to succumb to a relationship they wanted to resist first.The performances are so good I couldn't believe only March (who was splendid) and Russell were nominated, they won though, and Russell even won a second Oscar for his inspiration for WW veterans. But if you consider the whole cast, Myrna Low, Dana Andrews and Teresa Wright deserved nominations as well, but I guess they weren't because sometimes, the talent of an actor is enhanced by the directing, and the film owes a lot to William Wyler. It can ever be regarded as a school case of masterful directing.Indeed, what we take for great acting is sometimes a wonderful attention to details and characters behaving independently. In the Parrish' reunion scene, check how the father and then the mother has their first glimpses on Homer's hooks and try to ignore it. Another masterstroke is the phone booth scene, consisting on Homer playing piano with his Uncle (Hoagy Carmichael), Harry listening to them and Fred making a crucial phone call at that moment. Three actions compacted in one scene, meanwhile, many long moments dedicated to seemingly mundane trivialities, eating breakfast, dancing, drinking, working at the office.Wyler knows what deserves several minutes and what can be handled in one and each character is given enough time and substance. And you know why? Because the story is all about people trying to reinvent themselves, for that, we need to know a little about their background, about what they are, and what they want to be, the film looks simple, but it's far more complex, intellectually engaging. Not to mention 100% relevant today.",10,4,5,30 December 2017
Closer," In Love as in War: No Holds Barred!
","Mike Nichols' 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?' was about two couples whose relationships were so corrupted on an emotional level that they didn't have trouble using one another for hurtful purposes. I find the kinship too evident to be ignored, I could even find shades of Richard Burton fusing from the caveman charisma of Clive Oven, while Jude Law embodied the sensitive side of manhood, at least on the surface. I can mention the two female protagonists but this is a man's film, women's hearts are only tools forging the real rivalry between two schools of male sensitivities, the same premise with a female director would have totally changed the face of the story. But as a guy, I could 'feel' the film.Jude Law is Dan, the intellectual or the artist, he's got that brooding hypnotic smile of a man constantly caressing the dream of becoming an acclaimed writer, from the obituaries he wrote, he developed a talent for smooth and euphemistic and words. He falls in love with Alice (Natalie Portman) a strip-tease dancer who left New York after a break-up, and immediately, he reveals his weaknesses, displays the kind of modesty that is so exaggerated it obviously confines to pride, but it works with Alice. It works because she is young and impressionable, she can see the game Dan is playing but she's enjoying it actually, she's not naive about men but so disillusioned about herself she indulges to childish lucidity and let him have the upper hand. So, when he announces his decision to leave her because he loves Anna (Julia Robert), she's angry but can't hate him.She should have reasons to hate him, all he sees in Anna is that she's not Alice, she's harder to get, she's mysterious, she's taller and more mature, she doesn't need him so he needs her even more. Dan is a writer who sees life as a narrative and needs to earn her love, to be in control. Anna is a photographer and a well-established artist, but she feels like a hack, she only pretends to have talent while one can say she doesn't add much to the beauty shown in her picture. To a certain degree, she's closer to Alice in terms of self-esteem. It all comes to three persons who are not honest about themselves. Larry (Owen), the fourth force of the film, makes an accidental entrance after having a sexual chat with Dan, thinking he'll meet a nymphomaniac slut named Anna. The real bitch is Karma... and Dan, to a certain degree.It's appropriate that Larry has the only regular job as a doctor. He's not an intellectual, he's manly, he's sexual and sensual, he exudes self-confidence but is distraught when he realizes that his rival is the baby-faced Jude Law. But as a guy, he can see behind his facade, when Anna leaves him, his manhood is hurt because Anna seems to be literally possessed by Dan and under the questionings of Larry, she reveals how good a lover he was, among many details. Larry fuels himself with enough anger and sadness so he can prepare his revenge on Dan. It's a matter of raw territoriality; he needs to possess his woman back and teach Dan one thing or two about women. While there's no good or bad people in the film, you can tell Dan and Anna are the one who're taught a lesson.See the way they confess their infidelities, as sorry as they are, the hearts aren't there. They don't believe their own words; they just wait for the angry comment before moving forward. Everything is said for a purpose that can be either sincerity or fun. When Anna is about to leave Larry, she tells him that Dan is a gentler lover, when she gets back to Larry, she reveals that Dan is a mama's boy who weeps after sex so much for sincerity and sharing secrets. Larry throws that in Dan's face, triumphantly. He got Anna back by having sex in exchange of the divorce, Anna pitied him but he knew having sex would arouse Dan's old insecurities, because a man who wants to be in control can't accept a partial possession, Larry even affords the luxury to hit the final nail by having sex with Alice. Dan loses Alice not because of the act but the resulting suspicion.The real character's arc closed here is Alice, she's the one who changes, who comes to age, the film starts and ends with her, as a girl who'll never be used. Dan realizes that he lost his love because of his own jealousy and might become a better man. Anna came back to Larry, maybe she thought she didn't deserve better but he played the game and used her and Dan with incredible dexterity, saving Alice in the process. Clive Owen and Natalie Portman were given some of the best roles of their career, rightfully Oscar-nominated. Even the script deserved a few nods because I've seen movies with marital arguments but rarely that rang as true as the one between Larry and Anna, this is a film that talk broadly about sex, understands the adults to the point of showing them playing dirty games, unintentionally or not. When Larry tells Dan that he had sex with Alice, there was something of Burton's smile after he had just played 'Get the guests'.If the four characters of 'Closer' seem less troubled and ill-intentioned than 'Virginia Woolf', they all seek love in a way we can suspect to be genuine and sincere, but during this four-year journey, the streak of betrayals will reveal how twisted our actions can be in the name love and the limits of the so-called selflessness of love, a dirty game where the ends justify the means. Forty years after 'Virginia Woolf', Nichols prove that he still knows his business when it comes to intertwining couple troubles.",9,2,3,28 March 2017
Battleship Potemkin," Images Speaking a Thousand Words, for a Million People...
","Why is it that so many cinematic landmarks happen to be propaganda? I guess there was a perfect timing with the birth of a new art / medium coinciding with a new century, allowing the early cinematic masterpieces to be studied in film-making schools while not losing any relevance in history classes. If in its silent first steps, cinema was the latest 'hip' thing, a funny wonder from two French siblings or a mild bourgeois amusement, as technology advanced and authoritarian regimes were looking for the most effective ways to capture the spirit of the masses and then, cinema became a political weapon.It's all about masses when you think about it, propaganda movies confront us to the real bargain of cinema; different people sitting altogether in the dark, anonymously and eyes converging toward the same images. We're individuals but we form an audience, a collectivity meant to react. The director shouts 'Action!', for us, it's the reaction.And this is not a hazard either if most propaganda movies worked during the Silent Era where it was all about the power of images, dialogs rather than faces. In 'Battleship Potemkin', the most iconic image involves a woman with a broken eyeglass and bleeding eye, Bunuel had the eye sliced but the point is all the same for Eisenstein, the eye is more sensitive than the brain and Eisenstein definitely knew how to catch it.His 'Battleship Potemkin' chronicles the injustices underwent by the Potemkin crew, the resulting mutiny and martyrdom, then the solidarity displayed from the people of Odessa and the iconic confrontation with the Tsarist army during the iconic 'steps massacre' and finally another battle leading to the triumph of the Potemkin whose cause has been embraced by the other rebellious ships. Constructed in different chapters, 'Potemkin' bears some resemblance with the seminal 'Birth of a Nation' but the technique of Griffith was far more elaborated in 'Intolerance', a film he studied to get his inspiration. But while watching 'Potemkin', I was fascinated by the way Eisenstein almost never uses narration in his cardboards, they all feature cries and dialogues but they never verbalize.No need to, this is a film that trusts its material. If it was a Griffith' movie, we'd have a group of sailors coming to the office and complaining about the food. Eisenstein provides disgusting glimpses on the maggots crawling over the meat and close-up on an evil officer twirling his mustache while ordering for the borsch to be prepared (with the rotten meat). Close-ups are integral to the power of the film, because it's only when you grasp the feeling of one person that you can extrapolate it to the masses. Eisenstein understood that we all have a Pavlov reaction, believing that what goes through one person, goes through the other. This is why you can see close-ups on clenching fists, anger sights or before the massacre, of people smiling and waving to amplify the shocking suddenness of the Russian army intervention.This method also served Eisenstein for shooting of the climax, feeling that there was a lack of energy from the extras, he called one of them by his name, the others thought there was some sort of magic eye staring at them. In reality, Eisenstein picked a random name and had the right effect. That's exactly how the movie works, it finds the perfect balances between crowd shot and individual shots. That's the 'Stakhanovite' move, and while the massacre feel like a giant wave of people flooding down the stairs, there are individuals we still remember.Who can forget the woman who just witnessed the death of a child and carry him to the top, going at the exact opposite of the runners, that moment alone while giving a focus on that death enlightens all the other deaths. This isn't just stylish filmmaking, this is a humanity standing and questioning the use of violence. That's something that works out of context and that's the power of 'Potemkin', whether the unforgettable baby carriage, the killed mother and the broken glasses eye, at the very moment where it happens, we don't think of the Tsar, we think of War.So the argument that the massacre never happened doesn't hold up, Eisenstein wanted to shot the opposite of truth in the realm of plausibility, and that's why the sequence is powerful regardless of the context, it represents something that can happen anywhere and anytime, and for real. While seeing the woman carrying the child, I start thinking of the Vietnamese girl burnt by the Napalm and running scared and naked on the picture, I thought of that Palestinian boy who died in a shootout while his father was begging the soldiers to cease fire. 'Potemkin' uses a sort of universal language that transcend the barriers of time and countries, many propaganda movies couldn't work on a universal level because they're too specific. When Goebbels saw Eisenstein's masterpiece, he knew the Third Reich needed a similar movie and on that level, 'The Triumph of the Will' also became a landmark on its own, but being a masterpiece of propaganda doesn't make it a masterpiece in its own right. 'Potemkin' can get away with it because the film never let speeches undermine the message, it trusts the images and more than anything, it trusts the editing.Eisenstein needed a movie to celebrate the revolution of 1905, he initially planned to make an epic project based on many historical chapters but weather convinced him (once again) to have a specific focus, one central piece: from the Potemkin, the spirit of the revolution would be magnified. See, it's all about imploding from within, one image that speaks a thousand words, for a million persons.The steps massacre became a staple of filmmaking, countlessly replayed in movies for thrills or laughs, elevating it into one of the greatest movies ever, the merit goes to Eisenstein who was so creative and daring that he didn't just made a film about revolution, but he made a revolution!",9,2,3,17 March 2018
Taxi Driver," The Roots of Violence through a Powerful Character Study ...
","From the dark and misty streets of New York City's nights, two eyes contemplate the desolated degradation of society  the one who sees is Travis Bickle, Martin Scorsese's most tormented character, a cinematic icon who, through Robert De Niro's unforgettable performance, personifies the roots of violence in the most significant way.Travis Bickle, less by vocation than because of his insomnia, works as a nighttime taxi driver. The sleeping problem is the reason of Travis' job, and certainly not the cure for the alienating feeling about to ravage his soul, the torment devouring his heart, despite a 'clear conscience'. The opening shot of the film is a close-up on Travis' eyes; literally, he can't sleep means he can't shut his eyes, he can't ignore what happens before them. He sees because he's lucid. Junkies, whores, drug-selling pimps etc, all the miserable and rotten (low) life of the disillusioned post-Watergate America inspires Travis a pitiless comment: a rain should come out and wash all this filth. This rain is expected as redemption, creating at the same time, a psychological discomfort due to the guilt of being a simple observant just waiting  The filth sticks on Travis' soul like dirt on clothes and in his mind, if you're a watcher, you're part of the filth, if you're not, you're a 'washer'. Watcher or washer, it seems easier to plant seeds of violence in a land of guilt, and Travis' heart is full of it, like the majority of Marty's lead characters Travis' psychological odyssey is constantly written in a diary, through a daily routine monotonically regulated by the meter. The meter governs Travis' life like the clock of a psychological ticking bomb, which is is almost defused by an angelic creature named Betsy, a beautiful sophisticated blonde, played by Cybill Shepherd, and crystallizing whatever Travis needs to become a better man. Symbolically, when she notices him the first time, it's raining as if she was the providential rain that would wash Travis' dirtied soul  And the interactions between Travis and Betsy emphasize the intelligence of the film, because it raises an interesting question about Travis's responsibilities in his psychological troubles. Is he necessarily a victim of the system? Of a post-Vietnam trauma, or any other alienation? or is he just a social misfit in the pathetic sense of the word? Travis Bickle was listed number 30 on AFI's Top 50 cinematic villains; many will argue he's an antihero. I don't think his outcast status should automatically prevent him from the 'villain' label, which doesn't make him any less fascinating. Anti-hero or villain, he's clearly a sociopath driven by a growing feeling of hostility which after the rejection by his country, by society, and women, hit him like a real psychic boomerang. The gap between Travis and society grows larger, and nature hates emptiness. Gaps must be filled. When Travis criticized Betsy's nerdy colleague, he indirectly summed up his personal philosophy 'he puts his energy in the wrong directions', he said. Life is about putting energy somewhere. And Travis is not suicidal, despite his troubles. Travis' life is about filling gaps, which catalyzes his decision not to be a watcher, these are the roots of violence: not to take it anymore. We're not born violent, it's an existential choice expressed through acts, not thoughts. Violence is a physical energy; the rest is bullshit, pure hypocrisy like denouncing a situation without having the guts to fight it.Travis doesn't belong to the street, to society, so when all the efforts for normality and happiness become useless rejection, frustration, anger, alienation, all that negative energy plants seeds of violence in the land of guilt, to let a ferocious desire of revenge grow. Travis' energy is injected in a new skin, for a new goal, a selfish one, a redeeming one, in his burning eyes: revenge. The ticking bomb works again, and the explosion is imminent.Travis' legendary training, canalizing 100% of his energy for revenge, builds him a kind of supernatural strength through push-ups, exercises to increase pain resistance, and rapidity to draw a gun. The legendary 'You're talking to me' scene, one of the most impacting and iconic movie quotes, can be summed up in one word: paranoia. Travis imagines himself talking to his victim; eager to be pushed, to have an excuse to use his gun. He asks for trouble, any opportunity to pull the trigger is welcome, and he's not afraid, he's got nothing to lose. Violent skills and paranoia, the deathblow that start the tickling bomb's countdown  Travis has two choices: and violence is the medium of both, one is an assassination attempt and the other, concerns the situation of an underage prostitute, Iris, portrayed in a scarily authentic performance by a young Jodie Foster. Like the iris, she lives in the middle of Travis' eyes, in the center of his thoughts. She's an innocent flower that needs help, and she's Travis redemption. He can be a killer or a hero but the point of the film is not to make us root for Travis, but to show how violence works as a hazardous double edged sword. A bloody massacre can have positive consequences by purging bad blood, just like good intentions can pave the road to hell. In both cases, violence acts as a redeemer for the guilt-carrier soul, and as en exorcism of the frustration and anger's demons, violence like an operatic climax of alienation.Marty's masterpiece is a character study that invites us to explore the very roots of violence, through Travis Bickle, a character who's 'talking to us' by writing redemption in bloody letters, redeeming violence no less horrifying than the condemnable one. The irony is that after watching Marty's masterpiece, even the most horrifyingly violent acts that can't be justified, can at least be explained. Indeed, even the victims are not always innocent",10,2,3,4 February 2011
Shutter Island," A savor-less salad of cinematic tricks ...
","Guess who praised Martin Scorsese's 'Shutter Island'? Roger Ebert! The cinematography, the spooky atmosphere, the film noir's overtones, the whole psychological torment, the 'buried trauma' to quote him, as so many voices speaking in favor of 'Shutter Island', another great achievement from the greatest director of his generation.Marty might be the greatest as the most consistent director of the New Hollywood generation but I hate how 'great Marty film' started working like a pleonasm, as to underline a tacit rule that any movie made by a great film-maker automatically deserves the benefit of the doubt, in other words: if you hate it, you didn't get it. I'm sorry again, but the director who committed this cinematic piece of unoriginality is not the passionate artist who enriched cinema with so many masterpieces, like 'Mean Streets', 'Raging Bull', 'Goodfellas' and such delightful little gems like 'The King of Comedy' or 'After Hours'. I'm sorry but Marty didn't gain in maturity, not even in craftsmanship, he purely and simply  lost his touch.I have the biggest respect for Scorsese, and also for Ebert, and the reason I mentioned the latter is because he's certainly Scorsese's number one fan, but he's also one of these privileged persons who've seen so many movies in his life that he would be the least likely to get so easily impressed by a film, that blatantly exploits every single cinematic cliché, considering the story's material. The movie is so 'obvious' that it would be tragic if it wasn't so laughable. And it's obvious because it works on that reverse effect, as movie fans, we know that whatever seems obvious in the first act will probably be contradicted. True BUT whatever seems obvious is exactly the opposite of what is shown during that very first act, because we know we're being tricked by the director. In that case, it's like Scorsese was the 'sprinkled sprinkler', and Ebert's implicit denial of the script obviousness says a lot about his recurrent loss of subjectivity whenever it concerns Scorsese.I don't want to number all the clichés: the two detectives investigating, the entrance in the island with a haunting atmosphere emphasized by an ominous music, begging you to be scared, or impressed, a weird feeling of unrealism in some backgrounds that made me question what the artistic approach was, let's just call it 'homage' to old-school cinema, this one never gets old. But I wouldn't have expected this emphasis on the tone, screaming 'Beware  danger' not even from old-school directors, and certainly not from Hitchchock. Okay, we got the idea that something will go wrong; it doesn't even trust our patience as Di Caprio acts weirdly from the very first scenes. I was pleased by Ben Kingley's performance as the charming head doctor, but it's getting old since Nurse Ratched and I didn't mention Fritz Lang, because there are less risks that he might be known by the targeted audience.And I'm not even implying that the movie is not worth watching, but it plays like an overlong build-up for a weak climax, a build-up, during which nothing very pleasing happens. And I mean 'pleasing' in the pleasing meaning of the word, seriously. What happened to Marty's sense of entertainment? Why such a constant need to be dark, Gothic and gloomy? Is that Cinema's new emotional trend? Are we supposed to endure this atmosphere during the whole picture? Can't we have a break? a distracting element, not necessarily a comic relief, but I don't know, a subplot, an interesting character, even Hitchcock did itno, again, the time-filler relied on the guilty trauma, the good old theme so cherished by Marty, and that provides the best alibis to rationalize his films. And we discover his wife played by a beautiful Michelle Thomas, and some horrific flashbacks featuring the Nazi's atrocities, always a good taste to combine the supernatural horror with the real one, that's what the movie needed in case we thought we would cheer up at the end. Or was he just surfing on an opportunistic wave introduced by Tarantino's 'Inglourious Basterds'? The weaknesses of the plot canceled out all the cinematographic attempts to justify the movie's cinematic merit. Nothing special happens, nothing really happens, and again, it's so damn hard to feel sympathetic toward Leonardo Di Caprio! Yes, I have a big problem with Di Caprio in Scorsese's film, because of that same constipated face he has to display, to remind us that he's playing a tough guy. Did Bogart look tough? Di Caprio is a good actor, even great sometimes, but this is becoming one of his most annoying trademarks. I miss the young, lively Di Caprio with sparkling eyes and youthful look, because tough he isn't, and he doesn't fool anyone, and this is probably why the only Marty's movie I thought he delivered a great and flamboyant performance was 'The Aviator'. The first thing I see in a Di Caprio film now, is the poster, tough-guy-constipated-face? I avoid.An indigestible film with a risible attempt to scare us, I will stop here because I'm tired of being so critical about the director whom I praised most of his work from the 70's to the 90's. But he just doesn't do justice to his glorious filmography, Scorsese is a man of gripping realism of psychological torture and it doesn't need a supernatural flavor to taste good, it's scarier when real and more than that, Scorsese is a damn entertainer, with a unique talent of storyteller, and not only the story isn't told well, but it's not even a good story, as far as originality is concerned.And when comes the final scene, with the final line, supposed to summarize the whole message of the film and justify the whole build-up, my only reaction was : 'so, we got from that  to that?!' and this is my exact feeling when I compare between Marty's earlier and later works.",5,5,8,14 October 2011
Capote," One character study can hide another...
","'I thought that Mr. Clutter was a very nice gentleman. I thought so right up to the moment that I cut his throat.' This is perhaps the most defining and haunting line of Truman Capote's 'In Cold Blood', one that stuck to my mind like dried mud on boots' soles. The essence of Capote's masterpiece is to have asked the question: how could people like the brave, God-fearing Kansan Clutter family members be slaughtered like hogs by two hoods who admitted that they had nothing personal against them.The question could never have a satisfying answer. The book and its cinematic documentary-like adaptation of 1967 chronicled the chain of events that made the Clutters cross the path of Perry Smith and Dick Hicock and while we got a few insights on the killers' troubled personalities, there couldn't be a satisfying 'explanation' to the crime. The closest to a 'conclusion' was that neither Dick nor Perry could kill alone but together they formed that third personality that could slit the throat of Mr. Clutter and shotgun to death his wife, son and daughter.But for me, the real conclusion was that it was all a stupid waste, Hicock didn't have the killing DNA, whatever that meant, Smith was a tormented artist, if within their inhumanity, they were humane enough to put pillows under their victims' head, if Perry didn't let Dick have 'his way' with Nancy, so it is a real waste that they just didn't leave the house and let everybody live. I deplored the loss of six lives at the end of my 'In Cold Blood' review, daring to include the killers. Little did I know that there was a seventh victim, a collateral damage on an emotional level. Truman Capote himself, who died of complications from alcoholism in 1984 but it is established that this was a result from his work on 'In Cold Blood', the bond he developed with Perry Smith and the conclusion of this very relationship, one of painfully conflicting reactions.Bennet Miller's 'Capote' features the same third act than Richard Brooks' classic but this time with the focus on Capote. In the first film, he was a sort of neutral character, a man who allowed Perry and Dick to talk and share their feelings, with 'Capote', we get new insights on this relationship and the way it drove the writer's interest and then fascination for the case. I mentioned in my review of 'In Cold Blood' that it was one of morbid nature and somewhat it was. When Capote meets Alvin Dewey (Chris Cooper reprising William Forsythe's role) he tells him that he doesn't care for the resolution, the nature of the crime and the victims is the primal focus. It takes the discovery of the coffin's contents and the macabre detail: a cotton device applied to hide the disfigured heads so Capote can measure the atrocity of the crime.And then, when he finally meets Perry Smith, something just 'kicks off', and the duo drives the film just like Hicock and Smith in the first. What does Capote see in Smith if not a small man, half-Cherokee, carrying the stigmata of a tormented childhood, just like he does. In Smith (played by Clifton Collins Jr.); Capote sees himself, he whose mannerisms, short stature and homosexuality made him a natural outcast. Capote can't see any evil in Smith while he must admit that he was evil enough to commit such a horrific crime, this is the start of the book. And as Capote tells Perry, if he doesn't write his story, people will believe he's a monster. But Perry sees in Capote a genuine desire to help him, a misunderstanding that Capote deliberately entertains because he needs a Perry as healthy and friendly and talkative as possible.Capote loves Perry but he loves his project even more and in order to make his masterpiece, he has no other choice than compromising his own self-esteem. There's some moral justice that the process of making a book about such an affecting story would also affect the writer himself, as if no one could survive from it. And that's the most captivating aspect about the film because we see an artist in the process of making a nonfiction book, but whose basis is the character study of two despicable human beings. And in the same time, as viewers, we're also transported by the character study of Truman Capote and the way this hidden, hammy and cynical genius finally meets his match and makes the acquaintance with his destiny.'Capote' doesn't duplicate the shocking effect of 'In Cold Blood' but doesn't sugarcoat the disturbing elements, we see the brutal killings and we see how Capote approaches the truth as scared as confident. The performance of Philip Seymour Hoffman makes you realize what a tremendous loss he was for cinema and what a tragic coincidence that he also died from his personal demons, as coincidentally tragic that Robert Blake, who played Perry Smith, would also be later accused of a crime. Sometimes, fiction is crazier than reality and it is perhaps for this reason that 'In Cold Blood' revolutionized modern literature by proving that even journalism style can inspire masterpieces, the catch is that the nonfictional emotions would also spread to the author and ultimately kill him.In the film, Nelle Harper Lee, played by Catherine Keener, helps Capote in his investigation, and the project lasts so long that she has time to write 'To Kill a Mockingbird' and go to the premiere of the film's adaptation. It would take years for Capote to make 'In Cold Blood' and while Lee lived till her peaceful death in 2016, Capote would never recover for it and will die less than two decades after. You have nothing for nothing and what Capote shows is the prices we shall pay to have some unique and universal glimpses of human natures, even when scumbags inspire genius.",9,0,0,9 February 2017
Life of Pi," It's all about suspension of disbelief...
","Every once in a while, a movie keeps you marveling at the beauty of its imagery while captivating your mind with its intellectual richness, '2001: A Space Odyssey' is such a movie where images speak a thousand words, so is 'Life of Pi' with a difference though: it is pretty vocal about its content. To a certain degree, the film embodies the number 'Pi' whose mathematical function and simple writing are only the tip of an iceberg of infinite immensity.Still, Ang Lee's 'Life of Pi' is a delight for the eyes before the mind, a stunt even more impressive as 2012 eyes used to think they saw it all (3 years after 'Avatar' and less than a decade after Peter Jackson's 'Lord of the Rings'). Some shots reminded me of that line from 'Forrest Gump' who was running across a desert and the morning light cast such a glow that he couldn't tell where Heaven stopped and the Earth began. And 'Life of Pi' is fertile in such shots where you can't tell the limits between the sky and the water, and it is no coincidence that the story is a metaphysical quest à la Paolo Coelho, of a boy drifting across the Pacific Ocean with a tiger, of all the companions.God is obviously the 'guy-up-there' incarnated by the skies and the stars and Pi addresses him many times by raising his head, but when the sky and the water seems to make one, which might imply that Pi can find God, or try to, by looking at the ocean or in the eye of his feline companion of misfortune. Pi was named after Piscine Molitor which was the most beautiful swimming pool his uncle ever swam in, and in the scene showing the Parisian pool, the water is so clear, the man feels like floating in the air, it is not just gratuitous effects but the display of a heavenly, ecstatic moment, where the body and the mind are in total symbiosis. This is how the uncle found God anyway.To avoid the mockeries, Piscine calls himself 'Pi' and is so motivated that he becomes a champion of the Pi number and could memorize thousands of the decimal pieces, the cheers of his comrades making up for years of urological nicknames. But don't get mislead, the film is only about mathematics if you use the Galilean metaphor of the alphabet with which God wrote the universe. This is a language Pi is eager to decrypt, driven by his childlike curiosity, Hindu myths and Gods fascinate him, so does the story of Jesus Christ who died as an innocent for all the humans' sins, and he also finds peace and serenity while recalling the name of Allah during his prayers. Pi's ecumenical openness inevitably crashes into his father's rationality.'Appa', a zoo owner, is a practical man who doesn't believe in religion, he eats meat and would rather have a son sticking to strong opinions rather than believing in everything, being as 'irrational' and unlimited as the like-named number. So, it's the father who puts limits in his son's idealism where he sees him trying to feed the tiger (named Richard Parker), believing animals have soul. The father proves him wrong by tying a goat to the cage and showing him how the animals deal together. Animals have no souls, it is only the reflect of humans' soul, the metaphor for religion is obvious. We only see God through our own eyes, how ironic though that the father uses a sacrifice of such heavy religious undertones to make his point. As for Pi, the matters of God are forgotten for a time.And it takes that extraordinary journey where he's stuck with the tiger and has to learn how to tame it, to feed it so it doesn't think of eating him, to state his presence, mark his territory, to establish a way to communicate with the animal, until finally, Pi concludes his metaphysical quest. The tiger becomes his enemy but also his ticket for life. I won't spoil right now how the adventure connects with God, but it is all done in that conclusive last rhetorical question, where Pi creates his own myth, which like all myths, explains a fact through a story that might sound ludicrous but whose universal appeal is undeniable. Because that's what myths are: stories that go beyond our own perceptions, that seems impossible yet challenge our thinking to such a point that their nonexistence seems as unbelievable as the opposite.While I was watching the film, I was mesmerized by the special effects, the interactions between Pi and the tiger, even with the other animals. And I was almost disappointed to learn it was CGI, it didn't look like CGI to me, for some reason, it felt 'plausible', too beautiful to be artificial. But maybe that is the ground broken by Ang Lee. In 1914, a man shared a screen with a dinosaur, in 1964 one danced with penguins, in 1988, one was handcuffed to a rabbit, in 1993, dinosaurs came back in the form of CGI creatures, their realness was undeniable but it still asked for our suspension of disbelief. 'Life of Pi' is the only one where the animals are meant to be and look real, that the magic of the film would take a 'normal form' to better fool us.Some would say that God was a creation by humans but maybe the idea of God is so beautiful that humans only tries to make it approachable, like God who used the figure of Jesus, or Muslims when they pray or Hindus with all their Gods. Maybe less than the form of God, is the idea itself, maybe Cinema is like religion or myths, after all, it is all about suspension of disbelief, but for a purpose that is essential to the human soul.",8,10,12,26 March 2017
Lost in Translation," So Far Yet So Close...
","Twelve years ago, I stopped 'Lost in Translation' right in the middle because nothing 'happened'. Now, I'm married, I have a child and I'm as close in age to Bob (Bill Murray) as to Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), I'm in a position to contemplate the passing of time as deeply as they do and to appreciate Sofia Coppola's bittersweet romance. I guess they call this 'maturity.Using a hackneyed reviewer's observation, this is one of the film where the setting plays like a central character, I've never been to Japan but from what I heard from friends, it's one of these places so remote from the rest of the world that they seem unreachable even when you stepped your feet on it. From the language to the frenetic and culturally engulfing technology that still spared a few peaceful philosophical and cultural remains, a year of immersion would still make you feel like an alien, let alone a 'trip'. And the two central protagonists don't even care for immersion, Bob is here for professional reasons, he's one of these obsolete stars coping with the decline of their fame even if it means selling your soul to some Japanese brand, the awkwardness is a small price when millions are at stakes, and Japan is so far away Many stars like Harrison Ford or Alain Delon indulged themselves to such compromising stunts, with a face that said, 'Drink this whiskey' but in subtext you could read 'what the hell am I doing?' This is the unique purpose of Bob Harris' presence in Japan and Bill Murray was the perfect choice to embody the discomfort of this situation.Remember Murray as Phil Connors in 'Groundhog Day', a weatherman forced to work in some godforsaken yokel place and trying to look professional. Murray is perfect when it comes to say something while thinking the whole opposite, and even a diplomatic smile (confronted to these exaggerated bows) can be an anger directed toward himself, that's the 'wisdom' built on years of marital repression. This is not a hazard that Harris isn't just some actor questioning his career moves but also in the middle of a life crisis, wondering if this trip wouldn't affect his marriage, as if one couldn't recover from that solitude in the hotel, that the poster magnificently conveys.The hotel setting is perfect for the film because there's this neutral and impersonal touch that can only encourage self-meditation. The contrast also works between the hotel and the tumultuous life of the city while both Bob and Charlotte are busy trying to find a meaning to their life. Charlotte is the perfect counterpart to Bob, she's young, she's beautiful, but she only came because she had recently married a photographer (Giovanni Ribisi) and maybe thought it was a nice opportunity to 'test' the couple. But her husband is all business, and can't resist flattery from some B-actress (Anna Faris) and dedicate all his time to the calls of the job. If he's not escaping from something, he encourages Charlotte to evade the couple.Never has loneliness been so vivid in a film and as if the style embodied some Japanese Zen philosophy, it takes its time to build the bridge between the two lost souls who find themselves as soul mates as the plot move forwards. But this is not your typical romance, it's not about love, but about two persons who are so disconnected in real life that they find the connection in their similar situation: alone and aliens, and manage to dig deeper in their own existential issues. They're estranged from the world to such a degree that they can't be estranged one another, their similarity is the catalysis of a growing complicity, one everyone who's married yet chatted on the Internet or shared a few confidences with a total stranger, alcohol helping, will understand.The film illustrates a fascinating reality seldom explored in movies: we're never as honest and transparent as with persons who have nothing to do in our life. It's like the language of the soul that can only be understood by the person who'll be able to listen. The film features a funny moment where the ad's director gives indication to the female translator but this works like the typical gag (one used in 'The Great Dictator') where a long sentence in one hand is translated into a very brief sentence, but once you get what the director said, you realize that Bob was right: 'more was said'. The title 'Lost in Translation' is a great fit because it's not just a matter of languages.Feelings can be lost in communication due to haziness or habits. One can see more difficult communication between Bob and his wife and Charlotte and her husband than any language issue, and once Bob and Charlotte go to their night escapade, for a brief, enchanted moment, they're finally fishes in water. And it doesn't escalate to a sex scene, the film teases us with many shots of Charlotte's body but the most intimate moment will occur in a tender bed discussion where Bob shares his sincere exhilaration to be a father and delicately holds Charlotte's toe. There's a truth in the film that sometimes, one stranger can be the mirror that reflect the truth about yourself, in such a way you can communicate them, or at least learn how to communicate it. But Sofia Coppola who directed and wrote the screenplay (and won the Oscar) doesn't fill the film with complaisant clichés, and find the perfect note to end, that the final line said in the film, the one that seals the romance in a touching bittersweet way, is unknown to us. We never know what the whisper was, but maybe saying it would have lost its impact, it's like the film applied its own title.And maybe I was too young to enjoy it, something was lost in my own personal translation.",9,2,5,24 April 2017
Tangled," Surprinsgly good and severely underrated: the 50th Disney film might be one of its best...
","When it comes to setting up the story, 'Tangled' doesn't take chances, it goes straightforwardly to the point like most Disney movies do, and that's the privilege movies based on fairy tales can afford, we expect them to begin by 'Once Upon a Time '.So, once upon a time  Gothel, a vain woman who found the power of eternal youth in a flower that magically grew out of a sunshine drop. Unfortunately for her, the flower is taken by the Royal guards and is used to cure the Queen right before she gives birth to Rapunzel, a beautiful girl with long glowing hair. Gothel understands the hair have inherited a part of the flower's powers, but when she cuts them, it turns to a plain (and powerless) brown. She then kidnaps Rapunzel and traps her in a tower where she treats her like a mother.18 years later, Rapunzel grew with such a long and thick head of hair, she can actually hang on them, dangled from them and seize things like a chameleon's tongue, which is a funny coincidence since her pet friend is a charming chameleon named Pascal. Rapunzel is also a beautiful creature (who strangely reminded me of Amanda Seyfried) confident about her hair's healing power but like any girl of her age, she's got fears and issues. For one thing, she never discovered the world, and can only watch the stars that illuminate the sky, ignoring that those that appear every year during her birthday, are sky lanterns launched by the king and the townspeople as a desperate attempt to reach her. There is a lot of glowing in the film, but there's more than yellow brightness to that.'Tangled' is the 50th animated Disney film, it is a long way back to 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' but there are similarities despite the seven-decade gap. Like 'Snow White', it's a story of a fallen princess held prisoner by an abusive 'mother-figure'. And if Snow White found escapism while looking for a Prince, Rapunzel found a prince while looking for escapism. Like 'Snow White', 'Tangled' was the most expensive animated movie of its time and the product of a great combination of talent and perfectionism, like 'Snow White', it's based on a Grimm brothers story, and provides everything children and grown-ups except from fairy tale while translating to the big screen: action, fun, visuals, romance, fantasy, magic, emotions and a memorable villain.To a certain extent, 'Tangled' is Disney coming full circle with the very magic that enchanted many generations from all over the word, with a creation made for the 2010's but not so far in spirit, from the enchantment of the old classics. It's a delight to the eyes and it features two irresistible leading protagonists, in charm and personality, a not-so rebellious girl and a not-so unredeemable criminal, named Flynn Rider, a guy actually sensitive about his nose and wrapped up in the conviction that he's the most charming person on Earth. And for a change, the two characters don't really start their relationship through mutual dislike, their encounter is rather funny and uses some slapstick rarely exploited in legitimate Disney features.It needs to be pointed out that 'Tangled' belongs to one of the most refreshingly funny Disney movies. Seriously, how many of them feature a horse that is more efficient than his rider and is obsessed to the point you might discuss his psychological sanity or wish he was in the good guys' side? How many feature a frying pan as a deadly weapon and running gag? How many Disney movies feature frightening pub regulars who dream to be pianists or pantomimes', or a giant thug whose secret passion is to collect miniature unicorns? Describing these gags doesn't do them even justice because they work so well on a visual level. But I mention them because they highlight the best thing about 'Tangled' humor : it's unpredictable even when relying on predictable situations.Another example is that 'Tangled' follows a simple and conventional plot-line through the heroin's journey, basically, her discovery of the real world leading to her self-discovery until the final confrontation with the mother (with a few Oedipal undertones). But the plot matters less than the rich gallery of colorful characters it invites us to discover and personality traits of the two heroes that manages to transcend the usual requirements. The 'hero' is handsome but takes himself so seriously that he becomes pathetic, she's a free-spirited, idealistic and barefoot-walking teen who enjoys discovering the real world, but she's also reluctant to disappoint the woman she still believes is her mother. These traits are first mocked until they're exploited for more dramatic effects.Overall, the dosage is well done and makes the romance between the two outcasts believable. Naturally, some parts get predictable, when Gothel warns Rapunzel about Flynn looking only for the crown he stole, we know there'll be a quid pro quo, where she'd believe Mommy was right, but the conventional stuff is handled pretty quickly and the final third act is surprisingly efficient in its minimalism: no fight scene, no overdose of action and kinetic special effects, a simple display of love gestures and the perfect spectacular ending and feel-good twist. Rapunzel, in the tradition of coming-of-age stories, which are why fairy-tales were made for, was ready to trade her freedom for Flynn's life while Flynn decided his death was worth Rapunzel's freedom.This is the stuff great romances and fairy tales are made on. There are a few little things to criticize, some songs are less inspired and more forgettable than Menken's usual work, and the title could've been better chosen, 'Rapunzel' would've done fine actually. Still, I believe 'Tangled' is one of the best Disney films, one that magnificently reconciles between the old and the new.",9,2,2,13 April 2016

Interstellar," Is the Universe Friendly ?
","According to Albert Einstein, that's the central question any human being should ask themselves in their lifetime; and if 'Friendly' doesn't sound too science-friendly a term, let's remember that the iconic genius never took science as an end but a means to a humanistic end.Indeed, some secrets about our existence can be more profound and distant than any lone star from the furthest galaxy and perhaps the reason-to-be of science fiction is to leverage scientific speculation with an extra kick from human imagination, liberating a creative energy meant to anticipate the most daring solutions to our most troubling puzzlements... or simply put, to trust the future. Directed by Christopher Nolan (and co-written with his brother Jonathan), 'Interstellar' isn't set at a time that leaves much for optimism: devastating blights are reducing the Earth resources to nil, dust storms make the air unbreathable and in this suffocating dystopia, even politics and crime became pointless. With a beaten spirit, humanity undergoes the slow apocalypse. But how can anyone be a pioneer or a conqueror again when any part of the world is doomed, when there's no 'West' to go anymore? What's left then is one single desperate measure we owe to a Science-fiction's classic : 'Keep watching the skies!'. One man follows the motto, a Midwest widower and previous ace pilot named 'Coop' (Mathhew McConaughey). He doesn't know it yet but a scientist did the same, with fruitful results. Professor Brand (Michael Caine) found a 'path' to a galaxy with potentially inhabitable planets. While it doesn't take the mind of Stephen Hawkins to understand that there would be no chance of survival in any planet of the Solar System, I wish the question of Mars could have been raised at least once.We also gather that the exodus wouldn't be just some fancy cruise and might last a bit longer than the one to the Promised Land, except if you precede years with 'light', but this is where the interference (so to speak) between the screenplay originating from creative artists and a physicist named Dr. Kip Thorne introduced the fascinating concept of wormholes, sorts of tunnels that can take you from point A to another B within a universe comparable to a piece of paper fold in two, like a pencil cutting through it. And once you consider time as a fourth dimension, you guess the implications.Time travels, space travels, dystopian future, artificial intelligence ... is there one realistic sci-fi concept that 'Interstellar' doesn't cover? Once again, Nolan proves that he's the star pupil of all filmmakers, and there's only one stardust of sarcasm in an inner space of admiration. I sincerely believe that the film is so ambitious in scale, CGI and practical effects and attention to scientific accuracy that it is beyond any rational criticism. Nolan's wish was a studio's command after the success of his 'Dark Knight' trilogy, if there ever is one to push the envelope, to be the 'Coop' of cinema, it's Nolan.
But there's one reason why 'Interstellar' stands above other sci-fi blockbusters... no, not the romantic subplot with Anne Hathaway or Matt Damon's character. At the risk of sounding corny, many things are relative according to science, time is: one hour in a planet can equal 23 years, distance is no better as it can take as much time to jump from a galaxy to another as to travel from Santa Fe to Albuquerque. Still, there's one powerful force that hasn't unveiled all its mysteries and can be everything but relative, the power of attraction aka love power.There's this bonding between Coop and 'Murph' (Mackenzie Foe and Jessica Chastain for the adult version). Murph got her name from the infamous Murphy's law and the 'science-detective' virus and looks for any paranormal manifestation, some she calls ghosts... don't worry, there's an answer to everything and the rational answers provided later could only come from the man who designed the rubik-cube like plot of 'Inception'. Precise and effective, maybe a tad too effective. Nolan sure does this homework but sometimes, he gets so carried away by scientific perfectionism that he indulge to a few moments or lines where it's hard to keep a straight face.But even '2001: A Space Odyssey' had such moments. In 'Interstellar', I think I can sum up the criticism by saying that the film wanted to be many things instead of just one... and Nolan, wanted to make the consummate Sci-fi film, after which every sci-fi film director would ask himself 'what would Nolan do in that case?'. And I guess sometimes, there's nothing wrong with sacrificing realism for the sake of plausibility. Sometimes, I regret Nolan's perfectionism, could he make a movie like 'Back to the Future' if no scientist could endorse the theory of the flux capacitor? Once again, paraphrasing his greatest character, I want to ask Nolan 'why so serious?'. 'Interstellar' still touched me for its intelligence of the heart, the way it did answer Einstein question by making us parts of the universe, Earth can stop being friendly, not that divine whisper that made us exist can also figure out how to keep us 'immortal' and it's all about entering a journey, not with rage, as Professor Brand repeats, but with the sheer conviction that there's got to be a way.Mathematics is the alphabet with which God created the Universe, so all it takes is to break the code through the powerful bonding between two people. Bogart said: 'it doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world'. Well, according to 'Interstellar', the problems of two little people matter a lot in the whole universe, in the great cosmic scheme of things.That's why, for all its visual effects, its Hans Zimmer's score and heart-pounding action sequences, the most memorable part of the film is McConaughey's bursting into tears after seeing his grown-up daughter.",9,1,1,21 August 2018
Full Metal Jacket," 'Kubrick is Genius',.. 'War is Nihilism' .., 'Second Segment is Useless' ...
","Whoever talked about dehumanization missed the point, it's about desensitization. It's about producing killing machines whose soul is only dedicated to the Marine Corps. It's a brotherhood, a sort of community that transforms you into an animal with the most implacable killing instinct. It makes it clear; you're here to kill, because if you don't, or if you hesitate, then the enemy will exploit this weakness to kill you first. It's a matter of one second but this is the primal basis or survival. The title sums it up : it's all about killing.**************************FULL METAL JACKET Segment 1**************************The first part is how to make a killer out of a young man, a boy, an ordinary schmuck not less idealistic and enthusiastic to go defend his country than the next neighbor. How? The answer is incarnated by one man, one attitude, one power. Sergeant Gunnery Hartman. Hartman incarnates the progressive loss of innocence, of human compassion, of every thing centuries of humanism did fight for. No room for tolerance, for heart, not even for patriotism, the point is to become a man capable of not only killing but not dying. I said no patriotism but that's because the security of a whole nation must rely on men so dedicated that they'd kill anyone who's suspected to be a potential threat for the country. A powerful country needs this spirit, and even patriotism might corrupt this ruthlessness because it's made of idealism, and that's intolerable. In other words, better to be a Lee Harvey Oswald than a John F. Kennedy. And one soldier will become a Lee Harvey Oswald. Gomer Pyle. A heavy man whose first reaction he inspires us, is how the hell did he make it to the Recruit Camp. He's fat, clumsy, and incapable of any physical effort, therefore an easy target for the foul mouthed intransigent Hartman. Yes their interactions are both sad and funny, but in fact, they're funny cause we're too distant from this world to get the sad aspect, and sad because we're still too distant to get how this is so real. These boys were like you and I, but by being hit, they learned how to hit. It's all a question of psychology. And it worked for Pyle, it took Hartman's humiliating words, some soap and blankets, until he became as competent as Oswald and as 'idealistic' as him. Nothing else mattered except killing. War is the negation of anything that is not War.**************************END OF SEGMENT 1**************************When Pyle kills Hartman, it's the training's success. Pyle had a killing instinct but he reached his breaking point too fast. He was already in a world of you-know-what. It was like the war had already started for him, his war was Hartman Â… Pyle was already illustrating the alienating impact of the war. He named his gun with a girl's name but talked to Charlene in a sensual way, because she was his deliverance. Hartman was his war. God it's like the movie didn't even need to go further to illustrate the whole nihilistic epitome. Just look at Pyle's eyes before he shoots on Hartman and you'll know what's being in a world of you-know-what means, you see in his eyes, there is simply no feeling, no future, nothing ... **************************FULL METAL JACKET Segment 2**************************I'm perplexed. This part didn't show me anything I didn't know before. After watching 'Platoon', 'Apocalypse Now' and even 'Born on the Fourth of July', I wonder which newness this part brings. What's her contribution apart from two or maybe three classic scenes: the one with the hooker, with Animal Mother, and with the sniper. It's good, but not Kubrick good. It's like the quality dropped as soon as the most pivotal characters disappeared as if their whole antagonism were sufficient illustrations of the hellish and nihilistic states of mind war puts you in. I'm frustrated because I wanted to review the second part with the same enthusiastic approach than the first one, I really wanted and I could do it, I could over-analyze the thrilling aspect of the sniper part. The apparent dullness of those who encountered death so many times the sight of dead corpses only inspire one comment : 'Better you than me' I wish I could, but I would feel like losing my time, and like Kubrick lost his, he felt obliged to make a war movie. Without the war, it could have been a risky but genius choice, with the war segment, it's just, well, a war film. Kubrick is too important to be associated with this second segment.**************************END OF SEGMENT 2**************************I guess I share the same feeling than the Marines when they discovered that this sneaky dangerous sniper who wasted three of their friends was just a frail little girl. I had the same feeling ... that could have been worse if it wasn't for the great ending song scene, nothing can describe the effect of the Rolling Stones' 'Paint it Black' . A pity it doesn't match the overall quality of the first half of the film.**************************FULL METAL JACKET**************************Not full appreciation. But to the credit of Kubrick, the first part is one of the most gripping examination of the desensitizing effect of War. And the irreversible damage it exercises on a fragile mind. A genius part, brilliantly written and supported by outstanding performances by D'Onofrio and R. Lee Ermey. I think Kubrick's nihilistic approach to the war didn't need the second segment. And if this movie needed war, well, it could have been handled better for two reasons: to match all the great war films made before. First point. And second point. We're still talking of a Master named Stanley Kubrick.",8,1,1,15 March 2011
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," So 'Ebbing' Great!
","Billboards... Ebbing... So many 'B's' but a B-movie it sure ain't... far from it actually, this is high-level film-making, a movie meaning 'B' for excellence, B as in Business!And watching some shots of Frances McDormand driving across some random Missouri road and turning her head to her passenger made me feel I was watching an older -and grouchier- version of her most iconic character Marge Gunderson. That both performances earned her Oscars is no coincidence, she was born to be Marge and Mildred, Mildred Hayes to name her. The traits are more severe-looking, age did alter her woman-next-door charm but there's something in the eyes that left room to a certain gentleness, decency and sense of humor, no matter how twisted it is.Sense of humor indeed... in a story involving police brutality, racism, and rape, the evil trinity wrapped up into another of these typical atypical Midwest crisis, something you wouldn't believe it was possible before watching Martin McDonagh's acclaimed 'Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri', the film that came so close to winning the triple crown of Best Pictures yesterday (but took home the right acting Oscars). Yet as horrific and seemingly cynical (seemingly underlined) it is, the film immediately drained from the wells of the Coen brother's masterpiece's memories. If not as close to perfect as 'Fargo' is, it's as close to cinematic perfection as many recent movies confronted us to, there's just something immensely satisfying about 'Billboards'.'Fargo' was crazy, wicked but remember how it ended, Marge was summoning the newly arrested criminal, telling him that there's more to life than money, and he was going to jail on what was a 'beautiful day', the masterpiece of dark humor ended with a light of hope and you could even sense remorse growing in the sociopath's eyes. Just when it became so trendy to have decent characters descending into madness and psychopathy and all the viewers secretly wishing they could loosen up a bit as far as their ethics go, here is a movie where characters start behaving like the bad guys we expect, only to discover that there was something good about them that only waited for the right opportunity to blossom. If that film didn't win the Best Picture Oscar, at least, it shows what 'Crash' should have been to really deserve it.'Fargo' and 'Crash' weren't the only movie 'Billboards' reminded me of, there was something in McDormand's wounded soul playing like a reminiscence of Kathy Bates' underrated performance as and in 'Dolores Clairborne', a Stephen King's story that ventured into similar realms of traumas and vengeance by focusing on the tortured mind of an average woman. The parallel that can be drawn between the two performances (besides the fact that Bates should have been nominated) is the defining line of the film 'Sometimes being a bitch is all a woman's got to hold on to.' That line encompasses every single action of Mildred Hayes, never as an excuse but an explanation. When a mother has her daughter killed, abused and savagely burnt and the investigation leads to nowhere, she can only resort to the bitchiest side of her soul and yes, some wicked sense of humor... as the billboards would be referred to as a 'joke' by one of the main concerned people, and not in a condescending way.So how about the infamous billboards? These three unused things of the 80's in a road nobody takes, and the opportunity to 'create a buzz', at a time where Internet, twitter, Facebook attracted every attention-whore of the world, here's one hell of a clever use of medium, anachronistic, inventive (screenplay-wise very clever but wouldn't you expect that from the writer director of 'In Bruges') and the starter of a chain of events that will challenge and tease all your expectations. Because it's not much the set-up that 'Billboards' establishes which is its main strength but how it plays with it, toying in the process with what we would expect after watching 'Fargo', 'Crash' or 'August Osage County'. The film opens with a hardened Midwest divorced mother, a worn-out but benevolent Chief of Police targeted by the billboards played by Woody Harrelson, a redneck deputy played by the great Sam Rockwell, so many characters' tropes in a nutshell that end up being totally deconstructed, for moments of laughs, shock and some heights of emotionality you never expect (not from 'these' characters anyway).And it's all in the deconstruction that 'Billboards' work, McDonagh has just a way to make the story advances so that once you think you spotted a contrivance or felt something was going in the predictable Aesopian-arc way that the film takes a detour into a twist you didn't see while maintaining its plausibility and revealing a higher esteem on humanity. This is a journey whose starting point is a horrific act of barbarity and ending up with 'bad' people realizing that deep inside there's more room for decency than they would believe... and people who realize that just because they defend a noble cause, aren't immune to punctual bits of vileness. Now, that's challenging. And later, the film takes another path that leaves the perfect cloud of uncertainty, but I'll stop here because this is one experience I don't want to spoil, just enjoy 'Billboards', it is THAT good.The film is served by great performances, besides Oscar-winning McDormand and Rockwell, there's also Peter Dinklage who has a great shining moment and there's the so underrated Woody Harrelson who always hit the right note between pathos and humor and the neutered tone of the man who starts to take things seriously, just like this movie does but not without a level of edgy self-awareness that makes the whole thing oddly entertaining no matter how dark it is. Really, one of a kind!",10,5,10,5 March 2018
The Grapes of Wrath," We all got little pieces of the one big soul that belongs to everybody ...
","Watching John Ford's 1940 masterpiece 'The Grapes of Wrath' spares dozens of historical readings about the Great Depression. Through the absorbing realistically-handled journey of the Joad Family, sharecroppers from Oklahoma, the movie is a tacit homage to all the farmers who were kicked out of their own land after half a century, and by an enemy even more redoubtable because he was invisible. Call it corporations, banks, politics, it's impossible to point a finger on a responsible person, let alone a gun, all the 'Okies' are left with is a bitter resignation mixed with the hopes for brighter futures in California, the promised land.Through its documentary value, 'The Grapes of Wrath' works as the perfect contradiction to all the supporters of Capitalism as the core of American ideals. It's a film about the little people, those who had faith and lost it. The central character is Tom Joad, an ex-convict, released after four years. Joad was imprisoned for homicide but doesn't carry any regret, the 'victim' had it coming: he pulled a knife. Joad is the kind of more-or-less decent individual victim of unfortunate circumstances but learns to deal with them rather than whining. The second representative character is Casey, an ex-preacher played by John Carradine. The preacher lost the spirit, and it hardly surprises that it's Communism he embraces at the end.An ex-convict, an ex-preacher, ex-farmers, the gallery consists of a bunch of people who 'used to be', and seem incapable to conjugate the life in the future. In a world where farmers are forced to leave the land they walked on and died on, what positive can ever be presaged? The fear ends up killing Grandpa Joad, and the grandmother doesn't outlive him for long. But one person doesn't fear future; it's Ma Joad, and Jane Darnell embodies the pioneer spirit, temerity despite exhaustion, with her droopy but magnificently scintillating eyes. When they live the farm, she doesn't give a last look for they're going to California, and she has no time to mourn the past. She's not braver than the others: the night before, she meditated on her own sadness, alone, but as the heart of the Joadses, it's her duty to exude the happiness the Family is looking forward. The power of 'The Grapes of Wrath' is to vehicle its powerful and inspirational message through characters rather than facts. Ma Joad, through her eyes, smiles and spirit, incarnates the ferocious and so womanly attachment to practical stuff like eating, living, being clean, she's the unwounded soul of that crisis-stricken America. On the other hand, men are more inclined to think, to translate the facts into abstract notions, and ultimately to fight. Tom Joad is no more eager to become an agitator than anyone else, but the odyssey of the road 66, opened his eyes on the new face of America. Either facing the disdain or the support of fellow citizens, he understands that the salvation cannot come from the individual but from solidarity. His 'We all got little pieces of the one big soul that belongs to everybody' almost sounds like a spiritual protest slogan.It's even ironic that a right-wing conservative directed 'The Grapes of Wrath', but the whole socialist and communist undertones were less taboo at that time. The film was adapted from the Pullitzer-prize winning novel of John Steinbeck, released in 1939, at the dawn of a worldwide conflict that put the Red Scare into perspective. Naturally, the farmer's contribution to the war efforts leaded them to a more prosperous state, from which their descendants benefited. But as a slice of the American life during the 30's, the film encapsulates all the desperation, the fears and the hopes of a population that stopped to believe in its own ideals. And now that the world is stricken by another crisis, with the financial system, and the most pervert side of Capitalism as responsible, it's time to look at 'The Grapes of Wrath' with a new eye for the film is still relevant today, maybe more than when it was praised as one of the greatest American films of all-time.And cinematically speaking, it's also a gripping adaptation that conveys the oppressive feeling of this era through a very powerful black-and-cinematography. There's indeed a magnificent contrast between the shadowy photography of the earlier scenes and the sunnier ones when they arrive in the campground in California. At one part, Casey makes a poignant preach implying that he found a new faith, his face hides in the shadow while his eyes are clearly seen, as to suggest a new lucidity, as if the use of lights allowed him to shine within his own words. The same goes for Henry Fonda during his memorable 'I'll be there' speech, although the lines seem less spontaneous or more cinematic. And this is not to blame on the script but rather on Fonda who magnificently played a character full of anger and hopes, always distant but never unnoticeable, that's Fonda's charisma, subtle but irreplaceable, Fonda who should have won the Oscar for Best Actor.The film was nominated for several other Oscars, it lost the Best Picture to Alfred Hitchcock's 'Rebecca' but won a Best Supporting Actress for Jane Darnell and Best Director for John Ford. The two awards are much deserved for Darnell is the heart of the film, and fittingly concludes it with her immortal 'We're the people', you sure are, Ma  and John Ford who works each shot with an admirable craftsmanship. Many of them show all the Joadses in one frame as to continually sustain the idea of their unshakable unity, which is the kind of values that the film stands for: unity and solidarity.Quite odd from an American film to celebrate these ideals, but this is what makes it such an endearing, timeless, and universal classic.",10,2,4,13 November 2012
American Sniper," The Good American, the Bad Arab and the Ugly Movie...
","In a Hollywood Villains' Special, the late critic Gene Siskel stated that movies like 'True Lies' were predictable consequences of Arab terrorism. One could say the same about Clint Eastwood's war blockbuster 'American Sniper' with September 11 as the moral alibi. The context is to blame, yet we blame the people, the film is no 'Apocalypse Now' but Arabs are no Viet-Kong either.I'm a huge admirer of Clint Eastwood and I've always avoided this film. Even in 'Unforgiven', a movie I despised, the ruthless executioner had a few words about the men he killed. 'American Sniper' doesn't bother and I almost admire its boldness. Chris Kyle, the titular sniper kills Arabs, but since they're all portrayed as heartless 'savages', there's not even one millisecond allowed of ethical contemplation. Even in 'Saving Private Ryan', for one moment, there was Steamboat Willie, although his sympathy capital was averted a few scenes later.No such thing in 'American Sniper', a film shot in Star-Spangled Banner colors, white for the purity of Americans, all noble-hearted God-fearing souls with great values such as family, loyalty and friendship, and red for the dirty bloodthirsty Arabs. No wonder the experience of the films inspired some enraged tweeters to go kill a few Arabs, after watching 'American Sniper', you'd think you're doing the world a favor, I mean, is there any other community where mothers send their own children to death? Chris Kyle's best-selling novel didn't give much latitude for mercy, and neither does the adaptation. Yet I somewhat felt engaged by the character study about the patriot who 'did his job'. And there's nothing in Bradley Cooper's performance that doesn't do justice to the legacy of Chris Kyle, he was an American Sniper, and well, he 'sniped'. But he had that alpha-male presence, towering over his comrades, lifting heights, even his son is the tallest of his school and is predicted to be 6'4 tall, this is definitely the best breed of men, which says even more about the 'container'. After all, doesn't Kyle believe that America is the greatest country?Anyway, there are probably good Arabs who aren't all bloodthirsty savages but these are not the Arabs Kyle, or Eastwood, or any viewer was interested in. Fair enough. But even with that mindset, it was a close call before I decided not to press the 'Power' button. Eastwood made the right choice by throwing the most offensive material in the first quarter because whatever happens to Arabs after that is never as insulting as this opening. The film starts with muezzin call and in the same time, you see a scarf-clad woman giving a weapon to a little boy. Notice that when the kid is shot, the woman doesn't even weep or take him in his arms, she takes the grenade... so she proves Kyle right.Once again, after 'Rules of Engagement', we have the obligatory portrayal of Arabs as savage people who don't hesitate to sacrifice their own lambs. And we have the obvious parallel between the muezzin and the illustration that Islam is rotten to the core, and then we have the sunny Texas, a good old church and a father teaching his sons not to fight unless it's called for. There are three people in the worlds: wolves=evil, sheep=blind or weak, and sheepdog. Guess who are the wolves? Cut to the Nairobi attacks and Kyle's engagement in the Army and of course September 11 immediately dissolving to Iraq. So, we're supposed to believe that this war on Iraq was fair and driven by the patriotic fervor of American youth decided to avenge the innocent victims of September 11. Give me a break!Yes, the film doesn't care about politics, but neither did 'Apocalypse Now' or 'The Deer Hunter' yet these movies dared to question the necessity of these wars. In 'American Sniper', this is not even left as an option, just when you're trying to convince yourself that this war is pointless, there's an Arab or an Iraqi who makes it 'personal'. While we can focus on Kyle's conviction and dedication to the American flag, there's nothing that ever raises the question of the war's usefulness, why would he believe that killing a bunch of Iraqi would protect American families back there. And even in 2014, we all know it was a bunch of lies. Please, Mr. Eastwood, why smacking all these grandstanding poses over our faces... ellipses are great narrative devices, but not at the expenses of intelligence. Violence wasn't taught in Iraqi schools! 'American Sniper' was too one-sided it was painful.The film wasn't even 'bad' technically, but if you believe this is a masterpiece, keep in mind that any Iraqi director with half the talent of Eastwood could have made a similar movie from the other perspective, with a little focus on one jail torture or two. Eastwood's focus was Kyle and while he can't speak for himself, the man wasn't the fondest on Arabs, but the film makes no effort to show one Arab with one redeeming quality. I didn't expect 'Battle of Algiers', but even 'Inglourious Basterds' had good Germans!Some say the Charlie Hebdo attacks' context didn't help either, but let me remind that in 2014, hundreds of civilians died in Palestine and no one gave a ****. So this is a real revealer of a disgusting hypocrisy. What is not tolerated for Mel Gibson, Clint Eastwood can get away with it... and right now, he's preparing his next movie about other terrorists attacks. Any occasion to show the ugly side of Arabs is welcome (and once again, the film was shot in my country, Morocco). And what could have been an 'interesting' reflection of violence's blindness, I mean by that the untimely death of Chris Kyle in 2013, well that he was killed by non-Arabs was one fact the film wasn't interested in. One-sided to the core... or as if hating Arabs was the best way to honor Kyle's memory.",4,4,19,22 December 2017
Glory," The 'real' Birth of a Nation ...
","Ever since D.W. Griffith's infamous 'Birth of a Nation', a film like 'Glory' was long overdue to re-establish the truth and do justice to those who fought for freedom and equality. ,'Glory' focuses on Afro-Americans like films of the same year such as 'Do the Right Thing' or 'Driving Miss Daisy' but I disagreed with Ebert's comment that the story needed to be from the soldiers' perspective, because the film is less about race than the triumph of willingness through action. Women didn't vote for instance, but that was because voting has always been a privilege for those who defended the city: men fought in the army, not women. Duties give privileges and black soldiers chose to fight, aware that their blood would trace the road to liberty and equality, under the leadership of Col. Robert Gould Shaw, played by Matthew Broderick in a breakthrough dramatic role.There's one powerful moment near the end when Shaw is about to give the signal for the historical attack on Fort Wagner. He looks at the sea with sadness in his eyes but a growing exhilaration in his heart. Shaw knows he and the main body of his troops are going to fall, but he also knows that the 54th Massachusetts, the first Regiment of Black soldiers, had to volunteer for what seemed like a suicidal mission. And when the whole unit advances toward the sea, it's a true march to history and the infinite horizon resonates like the invaluable impact their action will have on the course of the war, and on the Destiny of America. And that is the true meaning of the film, men dying in a blaze of 'Glory', for one's death can bring so much for the future generations' lives: abolition of slavery, freedom, dignity, in others words: a just cause.Providing the viewers the capability to understand what goes through a character's mind without any word spoken is certainly the mark of great movies and 'Glory', directed by a relatively unknown Edward Zwyck, is one of them. And the credit goes to the cast, beyond Matthew Broderick whose boyish looks convey the insecurity of a young Colonel who is given a heavy share of America's fate on his hands, there are Morgan Freeman and Denzel Washington (and God, what fitting names for such a film), in performances that leave no doubt about their future as the most dependable actors of the next decades. And their characters allow us to value the accomplishment of the 54th Massachusetts, that became an inspiration for all the Afro-Americans through its heroism, determination, and resistance to the many obstacles that obstructed the road to glory, like the racism that was also prevailing in the North camp, to start with, and that severely damaged the motivation of the first enlistees.And recurring moments when they meet in the tent provide the necessary level of intimacy to understand what goes through their hearts and that they will never show to the whites, it also intelligently reinforces the idea that 'black' is not just a generic term or a monolithic group. They're not all wise or good-hearted, gentle or dim-witted, one of them is Thomas, a friend of Shaw, the son of a free man from Boston, highly educated and intelligent, even a bit snobbish. Freeman is a gravedigger, a man of a few words but each resonating like the sound of Black conscience. And the most tormented and filled of anger, but not without wit or humor, is Trip, played by Denzel Washington, in one his greatest performances, which says a lot.Trip's character blossoms during the film's most defining moment, when he's whipped for having deserted the camp. The slow close-up on Washington, climaxing with the tear running on his face certainly earned him his first Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, but the tear is not acting, it powerfully captures the vivid wound in colored person's hearts: the repression of their inner feelings, the regulation of their minds so they can serve the whites without hurting their pride, and more than anything, to never speak. Eyes are said to be the tunnels of the soul, and Washington's eyes speak infinite statements about centuries of dehumanization. In a less powerful but no less significant moment, Freeman's characters talks to Shaw, he never makes eye contact, and when their eyes meet, he immediately looks away. It's only by keeping a low profile that he could speak and ask for 'more shoes', explaining that it was the reason Trip left the camp, it wasn't deserting.But the 'shoes' issue is only one of the several injustices the men had to endure besides the insults during training and the inferior wages that infuriated Trip who rightfully reminded that 'Blacks stop bullet as fast as Whites'. Shaw, by tearing up his own ticket, sealed with his men the sacred link that would never disappear, and that ultimately turned them into great soldiers. Yet the first baptism of fire is long to come, and even after getting their uniforms, they're still pushed into the background to accomplished menial work and some morally low actions, which the film was honest enough to tackle. I guess the actions some Blacks committed exacerbated the same resentment that inspired some parts of 'The Birth of a Nation' except that Griffith's movie forgot that these men followed orders, and that war can turn every man into a savage beast with no distinction of race.It's for moments like this that the film works, it's because we know that these men are flawed that their sacrifices is even more heroic. The cinematography, the music, the realism of the battle scenes can compete with the greatest epics, but there's more than glory in 'Glory': there's the beautiful irony that these men never fought before and they were lead by a youngster who had as much to prove, and the conjunction of these two ironies cemented an extraordinary achievement.",9,1,2,7 August 2013
The Devil Wears Prada," And the Emperor Wears Nada ...
","Indeed, how could a movie so in-line with the world of fashion be so old-fashioned in its overall plot line? One redeeming quality though is that beyond the fashion facade, 'Devil Wears Prada' pays a powerful tribute to all these authoritarian figures we spent time hating in mind privacy before realizing how enormous their contribution to our lives were... that there will be a 'before' and an 'after' them.I had a teacher like that in Prep school, constantly squeezing out the best of my potential, and the hardest way. I remember standing during four hours correcting an exam, enduring all the year her 'this is pathetic' comments... until that magical day where I was prepared and all she could say was 'very good' leaving everyone in the amphitheater jaw- dropped.I never had anyone like that in my life again, and if I had, maybe my internship in a famous cosmetic company, so close in-universe to the Runway magazine (the Vogue ambiance fictionalized in the film), would've ended more positively. To some extent, this film opened my eyes and its premise and Meryl Streep's performance make the most effective aspects. Unfortunately, the rest of the film consists on a succession of clichés that didn't befit its ambitions, and the actors aren't to blame. As the editor of Runway Magazine, Miranda Priestley, Meryl Streep can get away with everything. Even if she looks like Cruella De Vil's hidden sister,you can see in her eyes, a hint of tiredness or compassion that gives a subtle note of three-dimensionality underneath the usual villain's archetypes. Similarily, even Stanley Tucci who plays Nigel, one of the most overused job trends as the effeminate gay designer, is convincing, so is Anne Hathaway as the naive rookie who learns the ropes... almost. She gives the first wrong signal when her carelessness to the world of fashioned is exaggerated by her ridiculous clothes, something begging to inspire the most excruciating mockeries, before the 'dramatic change', naturally.I remember in 'Miss Congeniality', despite a cinematic knowledge younger of 15 years, I didn't buy the way they tried to make Sandra Bullock masculine and I saw a sexy walk in a sexy dress coming one mile away. And when you have a 5'8 girl like Anne Hathaway with a lovely face, no matter how desperately you try to hide it, the 'dramatic change' doesn't share the same surprising impact than Olivia Newton- John in 'Grease'.And why did she change anyway? To show that just because her appearance changed, competence and competitiveness would follow? I guess I could have accepted it but her style wasn't even in the accused box, in a quite well-written scene, Miranda Priestly explains the flashy history of the so-called casual clothing. A little contradictory but let's say it was the first step for Andrea aka Andy aka Miranda's new slave... I mean, assistant, to take her job seriously. Fair enough.Then, came the crucial 'Harry Potter' episode when she couldn't bring the manuscript so she decided to give up, and her boyfriend, a cook, was okay with that. Then, she realized her efforts paid off when a contact gets her the precious pages. Fine. Why doesn't she say that to her boyfriend, instead of 'finally, I realized I shouldn't give up' leaving up the very details that could convince him that maybe she's fit to the job. That's what the film lacked more, a realistic antagonism and there were so many to chose : the friends could've been interesting dream-killers, but then fashion wasn't Andy's dream anyway, she wanted to be a journalist, but why not making it her dream ? It's an adaptation or Lauren Weisberger's best–selling report of her experience with Anna Wintour, but why not taking even more distance if it's worth spicing up the story. And how about Emily the co-assistant? Emily Blunt was noticed for her supporting performance, but more could've been done with her. She starts as a mean bitchy jealous, then she seems to help her and then, well, as motivated as she was to travel to Paris, she makes an effort to screw everything by appearing sick, snoozing on Miranda and forgetting a guest's name. Of course, she gets fired, why should Andy be surprised, if one thing, Emily dug her grave. Yet Andy feels guilty but then Emily bumps into a car and can't go to Paris anyway. Emily was written to be a rival, a mentor, a pro, a failure, a comic relief yet in each role, she was severely under-characterized. And under-characterization is symptomatic of what is wrong in the film.Andy's friends are written as reactive people who noticed how she changed, they didn't serve any other purpose than injecting some guilt in Andy's heart, while in the main time, the film makes us feel that she's making progresses, yet it should be wrong and we never know who is supposed to be right, Andy, Miranda or the friends? And the friends are so unlikable that we don't even want to agree with them. We loved Gordon Gekko as a mentor but we still found him despicable. There's nothing to root for here, except Andy.She's doing great and Miranda seems to appreciate her efforts, everything is paying off and then, in the laziest bits of screen writing, we're supposed to 'realize' with Andy, that this isn't the kind of job one should dream of because it makes you hurt your friends. And nothing rung falser than that phone she threw in a Parisian fountain. To some extent, I guess it disappointed me because it reminded of that internship. I gave up happily but I gave up nonetheless.",7,1,1,15 March 2015
Rocky II," From 'There will be no rematch' to 'Yo Adrian, I did it!'...
","'There will be no rematch  there will be no rematch!' 'I don't want one' This is from the first 'Rocky' film, right after the final bell and before Bill Conti's 'Final Bell' would conduct one of the greatest and most unforgettable concluding movie scenes. Rocky didn't win the match, but he went the distance, he didn't get down and never abandoned  and if Apollo won the fight, Rocky won the heart of the spectators, of the woman he loved, of all the viewers in the world who identified with one of the greatest and most inspiring cinematic characters.Apollo didn't want a rematch, neither did Rocky. So when 'Rocky II', the sequel starts with Apollo asking for a rematch, you know there's a problem in the continuity department. Does it really matter? Not necessarily, but this is what separates between the great and the very good films, 'Rocky II' ignored some plot details left in the glorious first opus because it was a necessary move to justify the sequel's very existence. Still, did the film need a sequel? I believe if it wasn't for the series, the character wouldn't have become so hugely popular all over the world, and there's so much optimism in Rocky and Adrian that it's impossible not to root for them, not to feel something for the little universe evolving around them. So even if the quality suffers, the series helped to construct a legend, and if anything, it contributed to show how great and deserving of a Best Picture Oscar, the first movie was.Consequently, there are two ways of reviewing 'Rocky II': on its own, it's a very poignant drama with an inspiring message, when compared to 'Rocky', it's inferior, but for its defense, it's still closer to the quality of 'Rocky' than all the other sequels. What makes it inferior is clearly the characterization during the first act. While Rocky was a lovable dim-witted guy, his personality flirts with plain imbecility more than in one occasion, Mickey was a funny grumpy old-timer, he became annoyingly aggressive, but still this is nothing compared to Apollo, who traded his charismatic flamboyance for an obvious villainous mask, so obnoxious and condescending toward Rocky, it's like the fight from the first film never happened. In 'Rocky II', it looked like everything was changed for the sake of the plot, accentuating the character's worst traits, with the exception of Paulie, whose transformation is left for interpretations... but doesn't add much to the appreciation of the film anyway.Another weakness is in the pacing, too slow and not as rich in characterization and content as the first, basically, it's all about Rocky losing the money he won, trying to find a job, becoming a bum again, teased by Apollo for the rematch, facing Adrian's refusal, and then Adrian's coma leading to a whole sequence where we're waiting for her to wake up and give her blessing. I'm not saying these parts are not correctly handled, on the contrary, many of them provided some of the most memorable sequences of the trilogy. The problem is that nothing can ever catch us by surprise, the viewer is inevitably ahead of the characters, we know Rocky will play (and certainly win) the fight, it's just a matter of time; we know he'll endure all the humiliations, from Apollo or Mickey, before becoming a hero again. It's so obvious that I could even picture Stallone thinking 'Rocky must conquer his pride back, so he must lose it before.' This obviousness was totally absent from the first film, that ended up with Rocky, unexpectedly losing the match. Here, we're 100% sure that he will become the Worldwide Heavy Weight Champion.So, inferior to the first film, 'Rocky II' is, but it's so superior to the following sequels, that nonetheless, the movie works on an emotional level. It features so many scenes that are both poignant and inspiring, the marriage proposal in the zoo, Rocky's attempt to build a life for his family, the coma sequence, the birth of Rocky Jr., Rocky's (hairy) heir and the father-and-son relationship growing between Rocky and Mickey. Being analytical toward the movie's minor flaws doesn't prevent from appreciating its simple and naive beauty; as a drama it's a decent one, and as a sports movie, it has the merit to surprise us through a very spectacular finale. I don't know if it's realistic or not, but at least it leads to a thrilling suspense and a final bell sequence that echoes the greatness of the first one.Despite everything, the 'Rocky' films have a unique talent to redeem their own flaws through their finales, proving that it's all about 'heart' and passion, and any rational attempt to decorticate what works and what doesn't, ultimately loses its significance. Whatever you say about 'Rocky II', it's a very good film that remains faithful to the spirit of the first one, it sins by being a little over the top sometimes, but overall, it's a great work from Stallone, and as the first film I saw from the series, it'll always have a special place in my heart  I remember how I wished I could be among those schoolchildren who ran with Rocky through Philadelphia.Now, I'm more skeptical toward that running scene, which is too 'cinematic' to be fully appreciated on a realistic level ... but Stallone is so sincere and genuine that I'm sure he only wanted an inspiring on-screen depiction of the 'Rocky' effect, an ordinary hero whose running steps pave the way for success, inviting us to follow them to go the distance, over and over again.",8,3,3,25 November 2011
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," A bit tedious and too serious for its own good, but still works as a build-up to the final showdown
","And there came the second opus of the 'Star Wars' prequel trilogy, 'Episode II: Attacks of the Clones'. These ranking considerations shouldn't matter, nor does the title actually as it doesn't reveal much about the film. But George Lucas who wrote the story knew this was only a build-up into the arc of the most defining character of the saga, Anakin Skywalker, the bridge between the discovery of a young Jedi hope and the tragic surrendering to the Dark side. Clones are tertiary to the plot, it's about a buffer role that the films plays so well it actually overplays it, getting sometimes too 'informative' and serious about these information for its own good. It even reaches the inexcusable point where it gets boring. Say what you want about 'Phantom Menace', boring it was not.Yes, I cringed at the parts where everyone cringed, but that had less to do with the acting than the realization that no one in this universe seemed to either enjoy himself or embody a personality of his own as if characters were all determined by ranks, powers and skills, which might look bad-ass during action sequences but gets rather dull during talkative moments (which the film is full of). Jedi are all 'force this' and 'force that' and Queen Padme is so wrapped up in her zealous sense of duty, that you almost feel sorry for Anakin who's constantly patronized for his lack of experience and responsibilities. While Anakin's frustrations are integral to his evolution, it nonetheless contaminates the film with his melancholy and angst, joy and fun never felt so far, far away.In terms of special effect, the film delivers, featuring quite a heart-pounding chase in a futuristic metropolis, going so fast you didn't have to notice the CGI. But for all the dazzling and visual delights it provides, the film doesn't have much to offer in terms of quotes, of wit and again, fun. Everyone is worried and depressed, with this constant bad feeling about something. Even the romance between Padme and Anakin, the story's centrepoint is undermined by constant melancholy and an incapability to enjoy the moment. It says a lot when a simple beach memory leads to a line as infamous as 'I don't like sand', but still, this is a quote most people remembered, at least it was original. Hayden Christensen was the scapegoat of all the bad acting accusations but to his defense, who could have delivered such a weird line and get away with it.So all through the film, I was begging for a few little quirks, just to break the tedium, and I got them with C3-PO and even good old Jar Jar, Christopher Lee as Count Dooku was another fine addition and the climactic showdown redeemed the film a little. And finally, despite all the little weaknesses, when the ending credits started, I had the feeling I enjoyed it to some extent. That says a lot about the power of George Lucas, his films are so interconnected and diluted within the greatness of the saga and its iconic status that it's easy to overlook the flaws. No fan can pretend they don't exist, and as silly or contriver they can be, they're parts of Star Wars' canon as Master Lucas decided. It's quite sad that these movies ruined the careers of the two actors who played Anakin Skywalker: first, Jake Lloyd and then Christensen because the saga survived.So I don't know if there's anything wrong with Lucas, but fans too should question their attitude, everyone is very stiff and formal in the movie and that includes Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan and Portman tries hard, but given that most scenes are for expository effect and probably shot with a green screen, everyone did the best they could, and Christensen is no Alec Guinness. But even Padmé and Obi-Wan lack that little spark that made us enjoy the interactions between Han Solo, Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia. The blame is on the script that overplayed the tortured mind of Anakin, constantly chaperoned by Ob-Wan to the point that he's never entitled to express a feeling without being reminded to 'behave'. Obi-Wan (Ewan McGregor) can be rather irritating.Overall, the film suffers from the same problem than 'Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers', it is the missing link, it doesn't rely on the 'rediscovery' not that it ends with the climactic showdown. In fact, it tries to find a way between the two prequels, but is trapped in its in-between status. It has its moments, the romance between Padme and Anakin is touching when you know the outcome and John William's score was so powerful I was surprised it wasn't nominated for an Oscar. The film features many splendid visual moments, and a labyrinthine (though muddy) plot that makes you enjoy the destination rather than the journey but if you consider the big picture, it works, it works because you know the universe is getting more and more familiar and because you know it will only gets better after that, the anticipation of the third act's greatness makes these flaws forgivable.'Attack of the Clones' works despite itself, Christensen took an unfair backlash, he than an actor who didn't choose the kind of angle of acting that would have reassured the fans, sometimes, his mouth delivers a line and his eye contradict, and it makes difficult to believe that a woman so far-sighted as Padma would instantly fall in love with him. But there's something genuinely pathetic in his performance that underlines his status as victim more than a villain. The loss of his mother while not as powerful as Luke seeing his house burnt is still one of these pivotal moments you keep looking for. In its own right, the film is passable, but as a set-up to the final act, it's better, but who watches it without seeing the third after anyway?",6,1,2,11 August 2017
Lion," Waiting for Guddu...
","Whenever I wander in the streets of the Moroccan Medina, I feel at home. There's that strange mixture of various fragrances floating in the air: spices, kebab, frying delicacies (not much different from these appetizing jelabis), sea spray from the fish market, tanned leather from the shoe shop and this whole conglomerate smell outsiders or tourists might feel stinky, but as far as 'my' senses are concerned, 'there's no place like home'. I didn't pick it, it picked me.And maybe there's something innately circular about life, we're born home, we move close or far from it, and there's the need to get back. I even have a personal theory: that even your children can find a deep 'connection' with the place you were born in, your home will also feel like home for them. And it is indeed 'A Long Way Home', the poignant and inspiring story of Saroo Brierley, born in India, lost at the age of five, adopted by an Australian couple and reuniting with his mother and his family twenty-five years later. What else can be said? It's a simple story but it's often in the most plain-looking grounds that you can find the most precious gems.Garth Davis' 'Lion' is indeed simple in its storytelling; it's linear and straightforward in its clarity. Basically the whole first hour shows poor Saroo looking for his brother Guddu in hostile and overcrowded streets of Calcutta and finding a few moments of relief interrupted by adults, and in the huge lottery of karma, some can look extremely friendly and have sinister motives. But good fate sides with little Saroo and one lucky encounter leading to another, a couple of Australian tourist discovers the 'wanted notice' published in a newspaper and they instantly fall in love with the kid and adopt him. Saroo is then taught English and good manners.Then, something interesting happens: while I expected some resistance, he actually tries to fit in his new family as if he's aware that there's something really providential in that couple of good-hearted people from Tasmania, played by Nicole Kidman and David Brienham. The one twist that spoils the family harmony is the adoption of a mentally troubled and self-harming Indian boy named Mantosh one year later. 'Lion' manages to say a lot without words, from the reaction of Sunny Pawar, who does a fine, subtle, acting job, I could feel that he didn't welcome this arrival with much enthusiasm but wouldn't display jealousy out of love for his new mom.And the way he grew up was in line with the character. Dev Patel finally makes his entrance as a brilliant young man in his mid-twenties, ready to embrace studies in hotel management, he's also a nice guy like you seldom see in movies, no tortured soul, no rebel, no wimp either and respectful toward his parents. Seeing Patel again made me regret how harshly I judged 'Slumdog Millionnaire' but I never commented his acting but a script that took a rather simplistic turn near the end. So, I was glad to see Patel again, playing another guy trying to find a loved one through a 'modern device' but I hoped Davis wouldn't derail the film from its beautiful simplicity.And I had a good scare when his soon-to-be girlfriend, played by Rooney Mara, started improvising a little dance on the streets as it almost felt like there would be some Bollywood number, but it was just her twisted way to seduce him, and it worked well, to some degree. Personally, she struck me as a too cold and sophisticated girl, I didn't buy that a guy so warm and 'sunny' like Saroo would fall in love with a younger version of Kristin Scott Thomas. Even the love scenes made me wonder if Mara wasn't still under the influence of her previous romance in 'Carol'. Never mind, the center of the movie were Patel and Kidman and as soon as Patel has this delicate 'Proust Madeleine' moment, the story takes off and with the miracle of 'Google Earth', Saroo tries to find the way back home.The film tries to inject some 'suspense' in that powerful journey but that wasn't necessary, I think they could have just compressed the 'research' within the last weeks before Saroo's departure and avoided these little 'pending' moments, only to focus on the relationship with his adoptive mother and some emotional insights about the heights of generosity some hearts can reach. There were many heartfelt statements about adoption that could have enriched the story but the girlfriend allowed Saroo to explain his existential crisis to the audience without never really existing on her own, I didn't care for her anyway. The tormented brother could have made a more interesting foil for Saroo and would have provided a fine back-story paralleling Saroo's experience.While 'Lion' isn't flawless, it's a movie whose emotional power relied on the ending, and when Saroo was getting closer to his home, I could find my own heart beating, that's for the empathy and that was the price to pay, to earn that teary explosion of happiness and a few emotionally rewarding revelations, concluding one of the few 2016 movies of universal appeal. Indeed, If there ever was one statement to sum up the general appeal of movies, or stories regardless of their narrative medium, I would quote the late Roger Ebert who said 'The more specific a film is, the more universal, because the more it understands individual characters, the more it applies to everyone'.Truer words have never been spoken indeed. Garth Davis' 'Lion' might have an Australian-Indian protagonist but anyone can relate to him, from India, Iceland, Jamaica, Morocco or any part of the world.",8,16,18,26 February 2017
Romeo + Juliet," Glittering Carbon-Copy...
","Movies like 'Moulin Rouge!' (or more recently, 'La La Land') are so lavishly designed and stylishly directed that the simplicity of their stories is no coincidence, they are well-crafted forms of entertainment meant to arouse emotions rather than thoughts.Indeed, while I'm not a professional on editing or filmmaking, what I gathered from years of cinematic dedication is that complex, multi-layered, character-driven stories generally call for straightforward directing, so that the form doesn't distract from the content. In other words, there's a time for '2001: A Space Odyssey' and another for 'Chinatown', and I can't think of a good movie that is both exceedingly directed and written (with the exception of 'Citizen Kane').Can we take for granted that people know 'Romeo and Juliet' so well that a few artistic licenses won't hurt, or are actually needed? Is it such an iconic story that it can sustain every narrative form without undermining the emotional bingo of the end? Well, I'm not sure the story is self-sufficient, while watching Leo as Romeo (talk about predestination in that rhyming) challenging Tybalt (John Leguizamo), shouting Shakespeare's lines with such passion I could hardly understood what he said, I was wondering if the movie wouldn't have worked as well or better had they been swords instead of guns, Verona instead of Verona Beach and good old Renaissance as the time setting.And it's precisely because Leonardo Di Caprio was an excellent Romeo, in his pre-'Titanic' fame years with the youthful charm, the wide-eyed innocence, the eyebrow-raising enthusiasm and penetrating sadness, he was a baby-faced young man who could easily pass as a teenager. The rest of the casting was competent, honorable mention to Leguizamo who looked as passionately angry as his 1968 counterpart Michael York, and to Paul Sorvino and Pete Postlewhaite. Claire Danes paled in comparison but not to the point of ruining the film. What did spoil the film a little was actually its own reason to be, Baz Lhurmann!' thought that Shakespeare's romance needed a rejuvenation treatment, as if it wasn't modern enough for younger audiences.The problem is that the story has been modernized already, like Kurosawa made adaptations of 'Macbeth' and 'King Lear', 'Romeo and Juliet' inspired good movies like 'West Side Story' or 'China Girl', love stories with a gang war as the backdrop. In fact any interesting romance inevitably revolves around star-crossed lovers, any romance owes a bit to 'Romeo and Juliet' which owed to all the romantic heritage of the past centuries. So you either remake 'Romeo and Juliet' or you adapt it, there is rarely an in-between solution. Lurhmann took the challenge and it's laudable, but his 'Romeo + Juliet' couldn't be a total remake or it would have been a second 'West Side Story', it was doomed to be half-Shakespeare, half-something else.And the problem is that the text didn't match the setting, no matter how hard it tried like replacing the narrator by a TV announcer. It was so busy reminding you that this is the Shakespeare play in its academic version (same lines) that it became unchained to its premise, while in any of the previous adaptations; the romance was the focal point, not its kinship with the original story. It came to the point that the 'Trainspotting'-like editing, the pop music, the opera, the shootouts, the awkward mix between modern settings and Renaissance-expressions becomes a sort of gimmick that overshadowed the story. The form detracted from the story, and the heart of 'Romeo and Juliet' is the story. If you're not emotionally involved, it's over.And the film could still win the audiences, had it not ruined the very scenes that could create the emotional involvement, through some bizarre experimentation. I didn't care for the 1968 version until the balcony scene; Olivia Hussey's youthful beauty, the purity of Nino Rota's score, the interactions between the young lovers, the film won because of that scene. So, I expected the balcony scene to enhance 'Romeo + Julier' but Lurhmann had to introduce the novelty of the swimming pool. What was he thinking? If you're going to stick to the play, don't ruin the most iconic part. How can someone be focused on loving while he's also trying to float in the water. Forget what I said, the whole thing just looked awkward and as sincere as the actors were in their intent to play 'Romeo and Juliet', it's like Lurhmann had another movie in mind.The film was a success but it was out-shined by the Leo's following hit, the one that put him in Hollywood map forever and ever; 'Titanic' the year after, interestingly, this was a tale of forbidden love that was closer in spirit and in heart to 'Romeo and Juliet' than 'Lurrhman's jukebox. And Claire Danes, with all due respect, is no Kate Winslet. Leo is a real romantic actor but the real star of Baz Lurhmann's film was Baz Lurhmann. His unique jukebox-styled directing fitted 'Moulin Rouge!' but as far as 'Romeo + Juliet' goes, it's still an entertaining little movie, that nostalgic of the 90's will cherish. For me, it's the film of that 'Love Fool' song and I have it on my playlist.",6,0,1,26 March 2017
Forrest Gump," Simply one of the Greatest American Films ...
","'Forrest Gump' is one of the rare cases of cinema's magic working more than in any other artistic medium. Everything is a visual delight and a triumph in the field of storytelling, from the cinematography to the editing, from Zemeckis' sober direction to an extraordinary lesson of acting from Tom Hanks, the movie IS the Best Picture of 1994, which is saying a lot, and one of the best American films.Every film tells a story, but a few of them have this capability to penetrate your hearts and engage your emotions like 'Forrest Gump'. There are no villains in 'Forrest Gump', no room for negativity, the only adversity consists on the many obstacles that life puts on your path, and the only form of heroism relies on the ability to overcome these obstacles, and whether you succeed or fail, the point is to keep your faith on life, and find your own Alchemy to transform coal in gold. And Forrest Gump is the first to have overcome the handicaps that would have deprived him from a 'normal' life.The flash-back introducing sight of little Forrest with his legs' braces, hand in hand with Mama Gump (remarkably played by Sally Field) would be too tragic if the script didn't rightfully choose to adopt a more lighthearted tone by making Forrest Gump the privileged witness of his time, of a cinematic journey in American History, with every piece of this epic puzzle connected in a way or another to him. I will never forget my first impression from the Elvis Presley part, the first indication of what would be the life of Gump. Something too promising to be eternally stuck in these handicapping braces, and the laughs work as the patient build up to a rewarding climactic moment, the miracle scene or an overwhelming celebration of the triumph of human spirit.And from this miracle, Forrest Gump becomes the fastest man in the world, and starts one of the most exhilarating chain of events that ever enriched a character. This is the power of Forrest Gump, a character defined by the way he is, the way he talks, the way he loves, defined by the events he lived, by those he underwent, and those he influenced, by the people that helped and loved him and people he helped and loved. Not one-dimensional or dim-witted, Gump is one of the most memorable and fascinating characters that even graced the silver screen. Who can ever forget 'My name is Forrest. Forrest Gump'? Through his silent moments, gestures, speech mannerisms and Tom Hanks' unique talent to transcend his everyday look, Gump conveys the profundity of a character affected and affecting a world in constant change, mirroring Mama Gump's unforgettable 'chocolate box' catchphrase.And what an epic life for an epic era, Gump's talent launches his football athlete career, which gives him a ticket to college, from college to the Army, where he'll become a Ping Pong player before converting to shrimp fishing. Every achievement of Forrest Gump is due to someone he loves, starting with his Mama who traded her dignity to provide her son the best education, Jenny, his best friend whose unforgettable 'Run, Forrest Run' will drain the miraculous force that would change his life. And his friend Bubba who'll indirectly provide the basis of Gump's fortune thanks to a simple promise. And whatever Forrest took, he gave it back, to his mother, to Jenny, to his best friend's memory, and to Lieutenant Dan, who thought he had to die in the field of honor, and learned the value of life from Forrest's unshakable friendship.That's why I don't get the criticism toward the film, as if Forrest Gump was a kind of liberal incarnation of the passive state of mind that guarantees happiness. Why do people feel the need to appear so smart, to consider a movie where someone got shot in the face accidentally, superior, and it's a fan of 'Pulp Fiction' speaking here. Maybe, I've missed a point, but 'Forrest Gump' is perfectly aware of its comedic mood that almost flirts with parody sometimes. Eric Roth's Oscar-winning script is a kaleidoscope of all the incarnations of America in people's imagery through a glorious succession of anecdotes involving entertainment, music, politics, Presidents, scandals, Vietnam War, following one of the greatest cinematic soundtracks : the Doors, Dylan, Hendrix  'Forrest Gump' is a wonderful voyage to Pop-Culture America! And the intelligence of the script is subtly hinted in some little details like when Forrest evokes his perfect integration in the Army. This is pure comedy gold without any forced laughs.And as there's no better comedy than a comedy with a heart, on that level, 'Forrest Gump' is so lighthearted it's almost blinding. I guess this comes from Forrest's heart, so pure, so white, like the cinematic allegory of Voltaire's Candid. How fitting that his last job is gardener, which mirrors Candid's motto that whatever happens, 'we need to cultivate our garden'. Gump does cultivate his garden as a sort of dream-like presence in a very familiar universe, a dream we'd loved to reach and touch, something that floats in our minds like this beautiful feather floating on the sky. Men like Forrest Gump are oddities only made believable through the magic of cinema with no other meaning than to inspire something pure in us.This is why any attempt to rationally analyze 'Forrest Gump' and discredit its success is representative of that loss of common innocence, this cynicism people disguise in lucidity and realism, unknowing that they fall in the same trap than those who ran with Gump thinking it had a meaning while Forrest Gump only 'felt like running'. Gump didn't necessarily choose his path, but he always followed his heart, his idea of love and friendship. 'I'm not a smart man. But I know what love is'. On that level, Forrest Gump was simply a goddamn genius!",10,3,5,1 October 2011
The Passion of Joan of Arc," If one picture is worth a thousand words, Maria Falconetti's eyes are worth a thousand frames ...
","Never had the torment of a woman been as beautifully portrayed, inspiring nothing but pure sympathy, as in Dryer's silent masterpiece, 'The Passion of Joan of Arc', pure sympathy in the Christian meaning of the word, and I'm not even Christian.I can't describe the emotion that tunnels me through Falconetti's eyes; words are feeble, futile, risible, such a performance can't be praised enough, it's like the divine touch of Joan of Arc really embraced Falconetti, she WAS Joan of Arc reincarnated on celluloid, it's even as if Carl Theodore Dryer traveled in time and shot the real trial of Joan of Arc  I know, this is from Jean Cocteau, but I'm only paraphrasing what is probably the feeling of a vast majority.We will never know how God inspired Joan to resist to the English Invasion during the Hundred Years War, and it's only fitting that this unintelligibility is featured in a silent film. What we see is an ounce of divinity inhabiting the eyes of Falconetti, this life in her eyes is the guiding light that comes from the bottom of her soul, we see but we can't reach it, because Dryer doesn't deify the heroin, not even make a martyr out of her. Indeed, if one word could describe Joan of Arc in the film, it's a vulnerable, poignant and heart-breaking humanity. Her face provides such a wide range of emotions that she hypnotically embodies the weakness of a woman harassed by a bunch of heartless judges, scared to death, scared OF death, yet she stands for her convictions. Her body betrays her emotions, but her eyes resist, her eyes mirror the true strength of her soul: an unflappable faith.Dryer's directorial work also deserves praises for the significant part it plays in the film, if you combine it with the editing and the screenplay. The movie is a period drama, but there are no castles, no riding knights, no feasts, no battles, except for the chaotic execution's aftermath. And the trial is only an excuse for probably the first cinematic character study, centered on one of the most legendary heroin that even graced the course of humanity's history, and God knows not enough women did what Joan did. Joan of Arc defines the very word of heroin as someone who's anything but a victim, choosing her fate, her destiny, not out of bravery but despite her fears. It's easy to die when you're not afraid of dying, but never heroism can be displayed without something precious at stakes. In the case of Joan, how could have she discredited her belief that God came to her ... to save her life?! What was the point of living after that? Like for any hero, there's the pivotal test, when she's subtly lured into signing the infamous paper that would saved her from excommunication, from the bonfire, at her integrity's price. But when she realized she signed out of fear, she immediately retracted and symbolically signed her own death warrant. How could she lie to herself when her eyes breathed the truth in its purest form? This is what the story is about, Joan's passion, a passion transmitted to the crowd when her head was shaved, when she carried the cross, when she burnt on the bonfire. Joan embodied a Christ-like martyrdom, sadder than inspiring, we feel sad because she's human, mortal and vulnerable. For the judges, the crime isn't even blasphemy, it's pretension. They mock her, shout at her, even condescendingly laugh, but there's always one moment where her eyes manage to penetrate the soul of one of them, and for a brief instant, one heart is touched by a sort of ephemeral light betrayed by one imperceptible facial expression.On that department, the movie is a school case. I said it's not a period drama made on a epic scale, it's not even on the scale of a trial film. The whole film is made of countless cuts and close-ups with a close to perfect capability to convey the right feeling. The film is a masterpiece, not just by silent films' standards, it reaches a level of artistic greatness independent from any attempt to tell a story. Look at the film even without that haunting medieval music and you'll still find yourself transported by these eyes, these facial expressions, even the wrinkles on the faces, the severity of a closed mouth, emphasize the nightmarish feeling endured by Joan. The camera is always kept low with the antagonists as to reinforce their powerful position, while Joan is under the camera with her eyes looking in God's direction. Whenever she feels weak, she looks down then turn her eyes to God, at times, her eyes move in every direction, when she's panic-stricken as any 'weak' woman, but ultimately, she recovers the extreme serenity of a privileged human being touched by the divine grace.Yet, at the end, she's still scared, and when she finally meets God, you can tell on people's eyes, the guilt carried on their heart, to have allowed such a martyrdom to happen. What follows is a chaotic violent battle, that leaves us almost emotionless because Falconnetti drained all our emotions, and we're simply exhausted after such an intense and disturbing experience. Again, you can analyze and make all the essays of the world, it always comes to this : Maria Falconetti's performance as Joan of Arc is the soul of the film, and the greatest cinematic performance ever, and the fact that it's her only role, makes it even more legendary, Falconetti and Joan of Arc are almost equally iconic.And in these recent days where the growing success of 'The Artist' revived the interest for the Silent era, movies like 'Joan of Arc' are vital to understand how silent films, beyond their nostalgic value, elevated cinema to its truest essence as maybe the most powerful artistic medium, to convey the universal language of the soul.",10,2,5,12 October 2011
"Monsters, Inc."," We scare, because we care...
","If there's anything that 'Monsters Inc.' proves is that the greatest stories, whether targeting a young or older audience (or both within the same person), all rely on a simple yet original concept. It's so simple in the film that you can almost guess it from the title.What kind of products or services a company named 'Monsters, Inc.' can provide? Well, what do monsters do best? They scare... but as the tag-line says, it's only business. And like every business, you need a target. Kids, who else? But the real question is : what kind of business would require them to scare poor helpless little kids? Well this is where it gets tricky, in fact children's screams supply Monstropolis' daily needs of energy, as simple as that. Their slogan says 'We scare, because we care', so all these monsters provide a necessary public service, and that one of their rules is to never get in contact with the children shows how actually harmless and worthy of our sympathy they are (or are they? ... suspenseful music).And to add to the enjoyment of a very creative premise, the exposition is a delightful sequence too, plunging us in a world populated by monsters, each one being a gag by himself. Indeed, I could easily figure out the instructions given to the artists during the making-of : 'every single monster must be unpredictable, different, funny and somewhat memorable' so we get a succession of animal-like creatures with the most bizarre or sophisticated physical attributes, big, small, invisible, hideous, you name them. And leading the show, we have Sulley and Mike (yeah, it's an Americanized parallel universe, what's the matter?). Sulley is big blue furry one with purple spots, cool and friendly, and Mike the little green Cyclopes, wisecracking and talkative. And don't ask me which of the gentle giant and the Napoleon syndrome guy is voiced by John Goodman and Billy Crystal. Please, don't.To complete the imagery, the film is all about imagery anyway, some others monsters are such masterpieces of creativity they shouldn't even be called monsters. Like Celia, Mike's girlfriend, voiced by Jennifer Tilly, and whose dreadlocks-like hair are made of adorable little snakes with reactions that almost match their owner (almost). From the ugly sight of the bulged-eye chameleon-like Randal Boggs whose ability to change color borrows more from the invisible man powers, it's easy to guess who's the movie's bad guy and who dubs him of course? Simply, the most funny-looking actor with the same weird-looking eyes : Steve Buscemi. A final honorable mention for James Coburn who voices the CEO Mr Waternoose, a crab-like cigar-smoking head of company who treats his best monster Sulley like a son and Roz, a daunting secretary with a ravaged-by-smoking voice that sounds like scratching fingers on a chalkboard.And all this colorful gallery works in 'Monsters Inc.' following a daily routine that coincides with Earth children's bedtime, the company provides a warehouse full of millions of doors from all over the world and each one leading to kids' bedrooms, a parallel universe we're most familiar with or used to. And this is where the little Disney magic works again : the film rings that sensitive chord reminding us the time from our childhood when we were afraid ghosts or monsters would come from the closet. Well, I was more afraid of clowns or wild animals and I was more staring at the window with fearful eyes, but psychologically speaking, that's not the point.So, let's get back to 'Monsters, Inc.'. Like any company, they have to face real market issues, one of them is kids growing more and more insensitive to violence, this is why they only hire the best of the best, the monster's 'right stuff' as suggested by the hilarious slow-motion sequence parodying the famous astronaut-walking scene. And apparently, Sulley is about to break the company's record, closely followed by his jealous rival, Randall. But one of Randall's evil schemes allows Sulley to discover that there's one little child he does't scare, a little girl nicknamed 'Boo' who grew an instant fondness on Sulley, inversely proportional to the fear Boggs inspired her. From fear to realization, Sulley also develops feelings toward Boo, and we know where this is leading, that drop of tear for an ocean of thrills and laughs, made-in-Disney.The third Pixar movie is another little touchstone of creativity and imagery that will delight kids and adults. It's good, it's even great at times, yet it lost to 'Shrek' that year, and rightfully so, for Shrek had a less sophisticated concept but treated with more wit and heart. And a parody of fairy material could only win over a concept that, as creative as it is, relies on one gimmick. 'Monsters, Inc' has heart too, and some moments between Sully and Boo will make a few eyes cry. But somehow, the film was victim of its own concept, and commits many mistakes with the whole door and closet systems, thus featuring a series of plot contrivances at the crucial final act. Not to mention the little resolution that plays like a nice twist but is revealed to early in the film to leave an impact.Still, a very good film.",8,0,1,30 June 2015
American Hustle," Slick, smart, quirk, irreverent, decadent... it tries desperately to be!
","I don't know if I have a bigger problem with O' Russell's films or the ecstatic reception they meet. His last film I saw was 'The Fighter', and while I didn't dislike it, I couldn't get all the praise, it was a passable movie with solid acting but too many loose ends to make the whole experience satisfying. Yet this director made the extraordinary achievement to have two movies in a row nominated in all four major categories, which has never been done since 'Reds', in 1981. I'll check 'Silver Linings Playbook' soon, but from what I discovered in 'American Hustle', what stands for great acting is the capability to act weird and over the top while in super disco disguises, well, then give a honorary Oscar to the wardrobe and that'll be enough.But the film is supposed to be a comedy!And I'm sorry but it is NOT obvious that the film is a comedy, as a matter of fact, the tone of the story goes all over the map and you can't really figure out whether it tries to be a lighthearted con-tale or some multi-layered character study. If it's a comedy in the sense that we shouldn't take it seriously, well, that doesn't say much about the film. But it could have been both funny and serious, this is not the hardest stunt a film can achieve, especially with a good script, but David O'Russell goes in too many directions for the film's own good. In the end, too many scenes, too many improvisations, too many jump cuts and cheap turns and twists, made the experience of watching the film extremely disorienting. Speaking for myself, just when I started to get emotionally hooked to Amy Adams' Sydney (and her chemistry with Christian Bale's Rosenfeld), there had to be the character played by Jennifer Lawrence popping up and getting increasingly 'important' in the plot. And this sassy bitch, obviously meant as a comic relief, would even get on Freud's nerves. As if it wasn't messy enough, you've got someone who's obviously not part of the solution, and keeps on nagging and shouting.. well, if that's supposed to be funny, just give me drama. And don't get me started on the 'Live and Let Die' part. I know the music is an inevitable element when you make a period piece, and on that level, O'Russel has a pretty good taste in music, but music feels like noises superposed to other noises, not just a background. Now, it is obvious that this is a wannabe Goodfellas and Casino, but it turns a rather banal scheme into something of labyrinthine complexity, just to milk the acting of the four stars and justify the awards nominations. I'm pretty sure that each of these characters were interesting on their own, but in terms of effects, they all cancel each other, we can't individually root for them, since they all spend their time acting like jerks, trying to outsmart each other and win the 'quirkiest character' contest. If you make a film about swindlers, a minimum of likability is vital, otherwise, to the degree that you'll start to understand what's going on, you won't really care for the outcome. It's not about having likable characters as morally right but providing enough perspective on their lives so you ca genuinely care for them. And this is why 'Goodfellas', or 'The Sting', are still acclaimed masterpieces, first, these films are easier to follow without being 'less complex' than American Hustle. But more than that, you have a clear view on Henry Hill's backstory and you see why Hooker wants to get Lonnegan. In 'American Hustle',, we have to assume that Irvin and Sidney had no other options in their lives, and that Rosalyn was actually smarter than her husband, the film asks us to take many things for granted, which could have been possible if the editing wasn't so deliberately chaotic. It's a pity because some parts were nothing short of cinematic brilliance. I, for one thing, loved the friendship subplot between Carmine (Renner) and Bale, culminating with that funny 'oven' scene. And it's very revealing that the only one who didn't get any award buzz was Renner, the one who played a straight and realistic character. It's like acting was elevated to some carnival level. All the others were just dressed as if they were invited to a 70's themed party and spent their time shouting and overacting, Amy Adams being the constant subject to an obvious fetishist cameraman while baby-faced Lawrence was forcing herself to convince us she was some mature thirty-something woman. And I know many directors have their darlings, but it was too distracting to see the same actors again playing again for the same director no matter how chameleonic or versatile they are, it is distracting. Renner was the good thing about the film, so was Bale to a certain extent, and the last twenty minutes were good but not as emotionally rewarding as they should have been if the rest of the film matched that quality. Maybe there's something to blame on the directing, editing, or storytelling, or maybe I'm an idiot who doesn't get the brilliance of O'Russell. But there was a similar film directed the same year, a co-nominee named 'The Wolf of Wall Street', it was a wannabe 'Goodfellas' too, but as Hitchcock would say, self-plagiarizing is style. And there's another thing that gives the edge to 'Wolf', it focused on one main character, and two supporting ones, and Leo was the pillar, the film could get over the top, it never lost its focus. O'Russell wanted to pull a Scorsese style-wise, but it's like he was intoxicated by the exuberance of his characters and the flashiness of the 70's setting. That he convinced the world this was a masterpiece is perhaps more fascinating than the titular hustle.",6,1,3,21 December 2016
Top Secret!," Hilarious From A like Abrahams to Z like Zucker ...
","Following the popular success of 'Airplane!' and its less acclaimed sequel, the ZAZ trio was back to what I believe to be the funniest comedy ever: 'Top Secret!' a hilarious parody of the WWII spy films and the 50-60's rock-themed movies. Speaking of rock'n'roll, one of the most defining songs of the film performed by Val Kilmer aka Nick Rivers is titled 'How Silly Can you Get?' which sounds like a self-reflexive motto.'Top Secret!' probably features the highest laughs-out-loud-per-minute ratio from any movie, as there is not one single moment where the action isn't punctuated by a gag, and that this very gag doesn't work. Everything in 'Top Secret!' is both hilarious on an anarchic and cathartic level in the way it plunges you into a never-ending positive mindset. You may say that this is the very principle of a comedy, what's more a spoof movie, but it seems like 'Top Secret!' has been specially concocted for pure and genuine amusement, and while the much more respected 'Airplane!' has its slower moments, especially during the flash-back parts, 'Top Secret!' was hilarious from A like Abrahams to Z like Zucker brothers.There are two kinds of gags in 'Top Secret!', the direct and the indirect one. The direct is immediate, mostly visual and slapstick, like a 'find him and kill him' stamp or a sunbathing girl leaving boob-holes in the sand. The best gags are extended and feature a lot of dancing like the ball scene, the outrageous ballet sequence or a feet-view panic scene. Anyway, whether it's an offensive national anthem, a singing horse, a little German, an over-hilarious moment when Nick is about to be executed and an old lady slowly approaches to pick up the phone, any attempt to list the audio-visual gags of the film is as ludicrous as trying to define which is the funniest. The indirect gag is the elaborated one, already funny by itself but leading to a much more delightful punch-line.The first one involves a weird shot illustrating the road taken by Nick Rivers and his manager, the map looks more and more familiar until Pac-Man makes his appearance, the very gag that sets the tone of the film. When Omar Sharif as Agent Cedric meets a colleague disguised as a party tricks vendor, the whole interaction is funny enough but the icing on the cake comes with the 'You dropped your phony dog pooh', an item which obviously is not sold. The gag works even more because we expect it, like when Nick is introduced to the French Resistance, what would you expect from a man named 'Déjà Vu' apart from 'Have we not met before?' It could have concluded here yet the French sounding names punch-line was with the black guy named 'Chocolate Mousse', which says a lot about an era where anything was acceptable in the name of pure comedy.I don't mean to be too analytical, but my regard for 'Top Secret!' is due to one of the two funniest and creative gags from any film, starting with the Swedish bookstore sequence, a cinematic achievement that would have made Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin proud. During that part, there is a gradual suspicion that we're not watching a normal scene, even for a spoof movie, there is something weird in the walking and the talking that gets funnier as it is more noticeable, the scene becomes hilarious when we get the point and yet it goes on and on, a book getting in the right place immediately, dust from ear to mouth, and finally Nick and Hillary 'sliding up' a pole. The sequence goes from funny to not funny anymore until it becomes funny again with the throw away gag of the puppy going backwards leaving the Swedish bookstore owner in a priceless doubted expression.The other and maybe more memorable one, as it made it in the poster involves a clever cow disguise that looks like a real cow from our point of view, it's simple but someone should have thought about that. Now, it became a comedic landmark used in many comedies when a guy disguise as an animal, inopportunely choosing the female one, and invites a male on heat to come on him, but back then it was new that even pushed the outrageousness by involving a little veal thirsty for milk, the villain's reaction (in the disguise) is a laugh-riot. That's the secret of 'Top Secret!', a comedy that doesn't take itself seriously except for its genuine desire to make us laugh. The rest of the gags are as good as it gets, and features many fourth-wall breaking, like when Nick and Hillary feels that the romance 'makes it's like a bad movie' and then they look at us, and many film references are made, notably one hilarious climax in a sub-aquatic Western bar, and a clever farewell a la 'Wizard of Oz'.'Top Secret!' is made in such a way, that we either enjoy a gag or wait for one to come, so there's no time break. The only little pauses are provided by these moments when we can enjoy Val Kilmer's musical performances but the humor is never away. But my enjoyment of the film is proportional to my sadness to see it so often overlooked by the peers and movie viewers, playing on anagrams, I want to say that 'TOP SECRET!' is a comedy 'TO RESPECT!'. Indeed, when I checked the list of AFI's Top 100 Laughs, I was surprised not to see 'Top Secret!' listed while 'Fargo' and 'Jerry Maguire' and less 'lol'ling comedies were, I'm even surprised that the film is hardly mentioned among the greatest parodies or that it didn't have any nominations for the Golden Globes.Seriously, I can't see, regarding 'Top Secret!', how funnier can a movie get.",10,20,26,13 February 2012
The Godfather: Part II," A Shakespearian tragedy for a Macchiavellian triumph ...
","By tracing a parallel story between Vito's ascension to power and the consolidation of this very power by his son Michael, 'The Godfather Part II' has an epic scope that remarkably contrasts with the 'intimate feeling' of the first opus. Yes, there's a cruel lack of warmth, of genuine love, of this very 'Family spirit' that cemented the iconic greatness of 'Part I' but that's because the very purpose of the film is to show another kind of intimacy, the one between Politics, Business and Crime, as to highlight a sort of inner perversity in the American Dream. This is also why the film is regarded as an epic.In 'Part II', it's not a Five-Families-war that structures the plot anymore, so there's no need for this 'team spirit' anymore, we're far from the good old days with Sonny, Hagen, Tessio and Clemenza, when the Corleones were fighting for their survival. The bigger your territory gets, the more invisible is your enemy ... so invisible he can even be one of your own. Indeed, even the first film ended with a betrayal from Tessio, Vito's trustful capo-regime, a shock that foreshadowed the idea expressed by Michael in 'Part II', the fact that 'loyalty relies on business'. What a world where you can't call your friends 'friends' because they are only your 'associates' but you still call your enemies 'enemies'! What a world when your enemies have to be kept closer than your 'friends'! And what a world when even your brother can betray you!'Part II' is a much darker film in its content because it plunges us in a world where there's no room for genuine and non-calculating people –after all, isn't one of the many things that make the first film more enjoyable the presence of such characters as Sonny- Even Michael has these words about Fredo, 'he's a good heart but he's weak and stupid, and this is life and death'. Life and death indeed, the family expanded its power, becoming one of the wealthiest in Nevada, but it's not New York City anymore, it's time to deal with a new category of enemies, more dangerous because they are more respectable. The film opens with a conversation between Michael Corleone and Senator Geary, but this time the politician is not the criminal's friend, he not only despises him but explicitly affirms his intention to 'squeeze him'.Michael's reply sets the tone of the film 'Senator, my offer is this: nothing', he wouldn't feign legitimacy with a man who just asserted his moral corruption. If politicians and criminals play in the same arena: business, then they'll play according to the rule of the strongest. Crime has ceased to be an underworld, on the contrary, it embraced the world, getting 'bigger than US Steel' as Hyman Roth would say, in the name of making a profit that would go as far for legitimacy as pretending to serve a country's economy, Las Vegas, pre-Revolution Cuba, even be able to elect a new President. If Coppola was accused of romanticizing the mob in the first opus, no one can hold the same accusation against 'Part II', and the directing plays a significant role to that.Indeed, it's impossible to end the second film with the same level of fascination created by the magical moment where Neri shuts the door on Kay's face, and maybe that's why we still enjoy the first film, because it has this sort of 'happy end' feel, because we are still within the Corleone's inner circle and 'the good team won' and could savor the victory behind the closed door. Michael became another man, even more ruthless than his father, but he was the Don in this 'underworld' context, so he can only inspire our empathy, if not our respect.But in Part II, crime, business and politics are all part of the same hypocrisy, and while Michael could count on the loyalty of Neri, Rocco, Hagen and even Fredo at the end of the first part, in Part II, he becomes aware that greed and thirst for power can triumph over the most loyal individual.... and if he didn't knew that before, the assassination attempt he miraculously escaped from, sent a clear message about it. So, while 'Part I' established the necessity of a strong loyalty to overcome a clearly identifiable enemy, 'Part I'I highlights the illusory aspect of loyalty when it comes to an invisible enemy that can be on your own side, even your own brother, consequently leading to Michael's descent into paranoia.The first film was a consolidation of power, built on Family, friendship and loyalty, incarnated by the warmth and quiet strength of Vito Corleone, we find him again with the traits of Robert De Niro, in his Oscar-winning role. He represents the heritage of Michael Corleone, the proper use of power, of intelligence, of heart but the tragedy of 'Part II' is to highlight the obsolescence of a figure like Vito Corleone in a world that got more blinded by greed and power, a world where Machiavellian intelligence was a more valuable asset than pure intuition and where even love and brotherhood could be reduced to sheer abstractions. Times have changed and Michael realized that the time of his father is over, and that he can indeed 'lose his family'. The tragic irony is that he lost it by trying to preserve it.The second film deconstructed all the values that its glorious predecessor stood for to draw a dark, gripping and harrowing portrait of Crime, incarnated by the cold and ruthless eyes of Michael Corleone, Al Pacino in what I believe to be one of the all-time greatest performances. It's thought-provoking, it's even more realistic, but maybe we blame it for not being 'more enjoyable' than the first film, more romantic I mean. For me, it's perfect the way it is.",10,2,5,11 February 2011
The Bourne Ultimatum," Good Bourne Hunting...
","And here comes the final opus of the Damon, decade-defining, 'Bourne' trilogy, whose key word this time is 'ultimatum'. 'Identity' and 'Supremacy' didn't give specific indications but the big picture, that was enough; plus, they sounded good. 'Ultimatum' sounds great. It's like our hero Jason Bourne (not-known-anymore-as David Webb) means business. And the film doesn't belie the premise.Speaking of titles, for the scholars, the French ones can be translated into 'Memory in the Skin', 'Death in the Skin' and finally 'Vengeance in the Skin' and if they don't sound like literal translations, they capture the films spirit and with the last one having that confident resonance preparing us to something great, even better.Now, is it great? Yes. Better? Maybe in the sense that the hero has grown on us and so have the supporting players like Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) and Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles) reducing Franka Potente's Marie to a memory relic, one that is given its respectable closure with the news of her death told to her brother (Daniel Brühl), a scene that mirrors the ending of 'Supremacy', making the emotional bridge between the films, and reminding that Bourne has personal reasons not to give up. The emotionality isn't overdone but it's right there.Some might prefer 'Ultimatum' because it shows that it's not just about missions being accomplished and even the hired agents aren't all cold assassins. But haven't the other movies suggested that already? I think the real merit of the 'Ultimatum' is to be as faithful in tone as it is in special effects to its predecessors and that it comes with satisfying answers without trying to come with a twist. It's played straight, ties the three plots together and ends in an effortlessly powerful way. It deserves its lion share of popularity because it doesn't try to be different.And it's the right approach because the whole trilogy toys with chronology, taking us back and forth from Bourne's initial training (flashes coming in the form of an ominous man's voice responsible for his brainwashing) to clips from the previous films, which makes the feeling of continuity and narrative fluidity necessary. We need to stay in the same universe. One of the best surprises comes with it opening before the final 'Supremacy' conversation between Bourne and Landy and that the discussion actually turns out to be a pivotal moment in 'Ultimatum'. And that's the only possible twist such a film can offer and it was a delight.In my previous review, I expected the 'David Webb' reveal to be a cliffhanger, it's merely an information, it was the date of birth I should have kept in mind. I knew there was something to gather from that scene but I was misled. And that's the merit of that last opus, it knows where it takes you and it doesn't matter if we're one step behind Bourne or his pursuers, we're followers caught into the ride, which we enjoy with thrills of anticipation. Whether in the crowded Waterloo station of London, New York perpendicular streets or the labyrinthine rooftops of Tangier kasbah in my homeland Morocco, the pace is fast, the stunts exaggerated but never unbelievable and the shootings (whatever the meaning) keep us on the edge.Even when we suspect Bourne or Nicky might survive at the end, there's always a little something to spice up the predictable situation: a few lines or a priceless surprise where Bourne outsmarts his pursuers and proves them that 'little brother is watching them'. The enjoyment is enhanced by these little patterns, these connections between the three films that reassemble the pieces of the puzzles so finely we don't have time to discuss the looser points: Bourne's insistence to change the girl's appearance but not his? The way the black ops can dispose of a British citizen with impunity? The CIA's incompetence or their insistence to keep secrets on what everyone knows. But seriously, is it worse than these moments where the bad guys could kill Bond with one bullet through the head and instead just stalled? Maybe the Bourne formula works well because unlike Bond, Bourne can't take any chance and must move quick and fast.As I said before, a man of action, action governed by a twisted emotional mindset: Bourne tried to find his past in the first film with the present offering a few hints, in the second, he tried to escape from the past but it resurrected as the Treadstone operators trying to silence him, so the hunter became the hunter. In the third film, while being chased by other CIA corrupt officials (this time, it's Scott Glenn as the Big Bad and David Straitham his Black Knight) Bourne's still the hunter, it's his past he's hunting and knows his mind won't know no rest until he knows the truth... a truth I won't reveal but there's a hint that it might come from two men from a picture: one played by Colin Stinton, and one Albert Finney. Guess who that'll be.The film's finale is remarkable in the way it doesn't go for a big spectacular scene. Paul Greengrass knows the action structures the plot enough to make drama the right culmination and even in its low-key approach, we have a great confrontation with agent Paz played by Edgar Ramirez, which echoes the memorable scene with Clive Owen. And naturally we have a badass conclusion with one smile and Moby's 'Extreme Ways' playing while we can finally catch our breath and savor the victory. No need for a conversation or a scene that says 'goodbye', the film is beyond these clichés, it knows its strengths well enough and additional blah-blah isn't one of them.And may I add that the film will hold a special heart as the one that will finally earn me my first IMDb Top 250 badge for the year 2008. Should be a matter of a few seconds after I click on 'Submit'...",9,0,0,16 March 2020
Fargo," FARGO : Funny, Authentic, Rare, Great, Original ...
","'Fargo' is one of these cinematic rarities for which the word 'original' has been invented. Never had a movie plunged me in such a unique atmosphere, and never will another film do. I respectfully salute one of the greatest cinematic creations, and I use the word 'creation' as this is one of a fistful of films that cannot be categorized. And this is the true cinematic accomplishment of 'Fargo', while many acclaimed films relied on homage to other classics, the Coen brothers made a masterpiece out of nowhere, out of the middle of nowhere, only drawn from their memories, a vast territory unfairly snubbed by cinema, somewhere in Minesotta.We're not in New York City, in Los Angeles, in the Death Valley, this is Paul Bunyan's territory, a flat region with a Siberian kind of winter that paints the landscape in such a blinding whiteness you can hardly see when the land stops and where the sky begins. It's a place that is unfamiliar, almost exotic to us, efficiently providing a memorable cinematic escapism. But the setting is not 'Fargo''s only signature, the greatest strength of the masterpiece relies on the characterization, which comes part from the script, and part from the acting. In fact, when you keep the cinematography in mind, you realize that 'Fargo' is one of these jewels where everything immediately penetrates your memories. That's why 'Fargo' was rightfully regarded as a classic almost as soon as it was released.The characterization is what gives 'Fargo' its color, its touch of authenticity. It's a movie dedicated to the spine of America, lost between two coasts. The film made me wonder why this particular place has rarely been used in films and I guess part of the answer comes from the film itself. These are towns where politeness and simplicity are significant aspects of the culture, 'Minnesota Nice' as they say. In the film, even the smallest characters welcome you with a shining smile compensating the sunless sky. They all are polite and hardly let a 'F' word slip from their tongue, even hostility is hidden behind politeness. This is the austere, simple but respectable culture of the habitants, mostly descendants from Scandinavian emigrants as it's implied by the consonance of their names, Lundergaard, Gustafson, Gunderson, Grimsrud, and that heavy accent, these 'Yeah' that sound like 'Yah'. The accents are the music that accompanies the rhythm of the film in an odd but so appealing way. The limit between authenticity and caricature is very thin, but it works because the laughs are never aimed at people, but at the situations they're going through.And speaking of situations, the setting is quite ironic as if it's specifically in these areas where violence is repressed, that it has to explode in the most vicious way. The movie is supposed to be based on a true story, but we all know it's more a kaleidoscope of the craziest and most memorable situations that impacted the Coen brothers, the debate is pointless anyway because the movie still invites us to contemplate one of the most pointless and tragic criminal affairs, initiated by Jerry Lundergaard, the Executives Sales Manager of a car company. William H. Macy portrays with perfection one of the biggest cinematic schmucks ever, a man so in need of money, he'll elaborate an incredibly stupid scheme by asking two criminals to kidnap his own wife, so he can get the money from his ruthless father-in-law. The two men are Carl Showalter and Gaear Grimsrud, played by Steve Buscemi and Peter Stomare, their relationship is driven by the 'talkative and stoic-guy-who- hardly-speaks' classic but efficient dynamic. How these guys could work together is mystery, but they must have their reasons. Anyway, from the first minutes of the film, the mission is marked by the sign of incompetence. Whatever Lundergaard tries, he fails miserably, whatever he touches is doomed, yet he never gives up. The movie disturbingly oscillates between laughs and shocks, but both are used spontaneously: it never feels forced, and helps to assimilate the absurdity of what is happening.But the movie could have never been praised with such enthusiasm had it focused the story on Lundergaard, Showalter or Stomare. The genius of the Coen brothers is the creation of Marge Gunderson, one of these impacting and memorable characters like only Cinema can provide. Her seven-month pregnancy gives a nice touch as it helps to root for a woman carrying life while investigating a horrific case of brutal murder, and makes so authentic and touching the famous moment where she feels nauseous, while watching corpses  just because of morning sickness. But she's not only a good and sweet woman, she's also very competent. She's the heart of the film, and her investigation is the Shakespearian journey into the world of simple people in their everyday lives with their flaws, their secrets, their kindness and sometimes their lies. Marge's sweetness probably relies on the perfect solidity of her marriage. She and her loving husband, Norm, exudes love and harmony that compensate the overall cynical tone of the film, a way of showing that these simple people, overly smiling, are authentic and admirable in their simplicity, and at least, they're happy the way they are. This austere simplicity is beautifully conveyed by the nostalgic and emotional score of the film that I immediately associate with this world of simple people, profoundly attached to their roots, and who have in their hearts the warmth lacking outside.'Fargo' is an original, inventive, beautifully written, film inhabited by a poetry that leaves you stunned at the end. And I'd like to thank Roger Ebert, as the one, who convinced me, from his ecstatic review to give the movie a second chance. I'm afraid to admit, that I didn't like 'Fargo' in the beginning, but it takes one second viewing to get the genius of the film. You betcha!",10,0,2,26 June 2011
Notting Hill," 1999: the 'Year that Changed Movies' ... except maybe for romantic comedies ...
","From Richard Curtis, the screenwriter of 'Four Weddings and a Funeral', 'Notting Hill' wandered through a labyrinth of cinematic conventions with such confidence I felt myself immediately absorbed by the story. Romantic comedies might not be my cup of tea, but not in Britain where tea is elevated to an institutional rank. And romantic comedy is not the easiest genre to handle; it has an obligation to reinvent new comedic and entertaining situations out of hackneyed material. For instance, as soon as the eyes of Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts meet in the titular area, we know they're meant for each other and that they'll end up together. But we also know it won't happen before the last five minutes, so the reason-to-be of 'Notting Hill' relies on the way it will delay each time the predictable resolution. And when it comes to rom-coms, it's on the 'how' factor that relies the effectiveness of all the 'aww' and 'wow'-feelings, they're meant to provoke.Like most romantic comedies, 'Notting Hill' starts with two lonely hearts filled with good excuses for having lost faith in true love: an indispensable attitude to postpone the romantic epiphany. Julia Roberts is Anna Scott, a movie star, an object of admiration for women, of fantasies for men, and harassment from the Press and Tabloids.(and Britain is certainly not the safest place to visit when you're a celebrity of her caliber). And in the love department, Anna Scott had the kind of romances that would have made lousy Curtis' screenplays, when we meet her, she has 'naturally' a boyfriend, but 'naturally', it's not official. Nothing is.And Anna Scott is such an obvious alter-ego of Julia Roberts that her name doesn't fool us, there's no doubt about her autobiographical inspiration, if it wasn't intended in the beginning, at the end, no one can ever dissociate the fictional from the real actress, but this is definitely not a flaw. At one point, Anna even mentions the disillusion of her stardom and the artifices she had to undergo to earn her 15 millions for a role, and then there's this little sparkle that disappear in Julia Roberts' eyes, as if Anna became the vehicle of Julia's truth. And in the process, Julia Roberts brings so much sincerity to her role that our empathy is granted for her, as it's impossible not to forgive the attitude she displays with the poor, well- meaning William, played by Hugh Grant.Grant is a divorced man, running a modest travel bookstore, sharing a house with an eccentric and nonchalant roommate (Rhys Ifans) who keeps exposing his dirty soles on the table, something that would immediately cure from the most hardcore foot fetishism. By the way, I suspect the director Roger Mitchell for having quite an obsession with feet and after Rhys Ifans and Hugh Grant, I was glad we could have some glimpse on Julia Roberts'. Anyway, there is Grant as William, who despite all his misadventures, is still in love with Anna Scott. Nothing happens at their first encounter but a few minutes later, through one of the gutsiest plot devices ever written, he collides with her, spilling orange juice on her shirt, and a perfect excuse to invite her to his house, and when she kisses him, it's  well, didn't I use the word 'obviousness'?Yet, there's one obvious element that is handled perfectly: the supporting cast. If you believe that nothing could beat the joyful bunch from 'Four Weddings and a Funeral', wait till you see 'Notting Hill'. Now, that is a group that could have inspired a less insipid sitcom than 'How I Met With Your Mother'. We meet them during the first date between Anna and William coinciding with his sister's birthday: a lovable couple with a woman on a wheelchair, William's goofy airhead sister, a buffoonish stockbroker, they all make lovable losers (in the positive meaning of the term) genuinely supporting William and blessing his actions and decisions with the most cheerful approvals, with such friends, who'd even need a girlfriend? Except one like Julia  I mean, Anna Scott.William's friends contribute to one of the best written dinner scenes featuring a game in which the last piece of cake would be earned by the saddest story teller (not a piece of cake exercise).. And the scene provides some serious and tender moments proving that 'Notting Hill' is more than your average romantic comedy. Indeed, while the two stars in the posters might be invitation for the most cynical expectations, 'Notting Hill' tactfully and elegantly walks on the tightrope of its screenplay and never falls into the stereotypical schmaltz that could have destroyed it, even the so-called cringe-worthy line supposed to be the 'is it still raining' of the film, suited the story. However, I noticed that the choice of songs seemed kind of out-of-place sometimes and. I was glad, after reading Roger Ebert's review that he also was annoyed by the 'Ain't no Sunshine' montage after the break-up. Who needs a song with 'when she's gone' when we know what's going on? (By the way, I hope you won't take this as a spoiler, wouldn't you expect one break-up in a romantic comedy?)Perhaps regret on the redundancy of some situations, and the fact that Grant remains all stoical, never abandoning his British phlegm  seriously, when you know you love one person, would you take that much time before taking the big dive? Sometimes, one delay is one too much, or it betters leads up to a better conclusion. And I wouldn't have been that enthusiastic if the film didn't fulfill this premise, when it ends, it's a cheerful celebration, not overdone like 'Love Actually', but with the right amount of positivity and tenderness, and the last shot is probably some of the best that ever concluded a romantic film.And thank God, they didn't think of putting 'Here Comes the Sun'.",8,2,4,28 July 2013
The Aviator," This is the way of Scorsese, the way of Scorsese, the way of Scorsese, the way of Sc...
","It doesn't have the look, the style, but when the movie is over, you realize this is a cinematic experience like only Marty could have provided: a huge and dazzlingly decadent celebration of the American Dream from the mature -but never cynical- perspective of a true patriot. This good American is no one else but Howard Hugues, a precocious pioneer who has everything: he's rich, he's an aviator and a real one -this is no Frank Abagnale- and he's handsome. And no one but Leonardo Di Caprio could have embodied these 'no contradictions', and made me so doubtful that such a story would inspire me I'm glad I was wrong  The thing when you're a fan of Scorsese, you try to find a bit of Travis Bickle or 'Goodfellas' in every film he made since, especially the latest ones  movies whose masterful confidence in the directing and flamboyant ambition in the story almost worked as obstacles for the Scorsesian touch. When I was watching the scene where Howard Hugues, the handsome playboy, makes Jean Harlow literally melt of desire, I totally forgot about the first scene, where he was spelling the word QUARANTINE with his mother (?), probably the origin of his obsession with cleanliness. I forgot about this scene and I thought, okay, here he comes, the handsome guy will get the pretty doll, pretty dull, isn't it? Leo would play Leo all through the film, whose only redeeming qualities would be the beautiful and convincing recreation of Hollywood's Golden Age, and the incredible characterization of Katharine Hepburn by Cate Blanchett. Thankfully, these fears didn't last, when I realized how truly Scorsesian was our lead character, and that the success story is less due to luck, or gift, than to a sublimated obsession.Obsession, this is what drives Howard Hugues, not ambition, because in a way, ambition admits the possibility of failing. But the obsession of Howard is not to fail, it's to win, it's to build the best planes and to make the best movies. Don't call it perfectionism, this word is absent from his vocabulary, for nothing can be too perfect for him. It's simple; either Howard Hugues is the craziest character ever or the most inspiring. When the movie starts growing on you, you realize he's both, and that each of these sides of his personality drives the other. Scorsesian characters have this in common; they look straight-forward to escape from that thing behind, haunting them  The source of the psychological torment, always rooted in the spirit of the character, creates either noble or despicable motives, but in both cases, everything has a point, and everything has a reason. The question is: where will this lead? To the top, or to the fall  Let's just say, that 'Aviator' is the story of a character whose Scorsesian condition leads to the top, literally  The inspirational aspect of 'The Aviator' is how it reconciles with the idea, almost a cliché, that whatever doesn't kill you makes you strongest  and that your very flaws or so-called weaknesses shall never be hidden or repressed because they might be the key of your personal accomplishment. Your difference is your strength. The film is about the transcending craziness into an gigantic ambition, so out of proportions, that only in America, it can work it's the idea that nothing is impossible. It's almost pretentious, as if Scorsese defended the idea that only tormented men made the world, but is he wrong? Let's face it, for goodness or badness, this world has been built by men with visions  and Howard Hugues had these visions, this extra sensibility that transformed his paranoia into a prophetic capability.And these obsessions, tormenting the mind of Howard Hugues: cleanliness, perfection, repeating the same sentences, were not an invitation to label him as crazy. Calling him this way is missing the point, he's not crazy, he's simply alienated by his obsession of perfection, the idea behind Howard Hugues' story is that when we want to become something, that something finally becomes us. Clean, perfect, efficient, everything must obey to a total physical and spiritual harmony and it does drive you crazy  this is the maddening yang of the successful yin. For each construction, there is a destruction, a gargantuan plane flying has cost many others to crash, for every kiss with a star, Jean, Kate, Ava or Jane, there was a rib broken, or a burnt skin. If it wasn't for all the flash, and all the distracting Hollywood's portrayal, this would probably be the deepest and most philosophical Marty's film.I reckon I felt immediate empathy to Howard Hugues as soon as I got the gravity of his obsession, because I could put myself in his shoes, and I liked him, even more because I hated him first, I was jealous, it's like I wanted him to get a comeuppance for a fault he didn't commit. But this strengthened my empathy even more, and the more he got hit, the more enthusiastic I was, when I could see him hit back. Because he illustrated the struggle of the mad but inspiring visionary facet of the American dream to overcome its most perverse aspect: thirst for monopoly and financial power. It's not TWA vs. Pan Am, its two American philosophies confronting each other in a Scorsesian arena.It's almost a referential film, as if Scorsese uses this character as a therapy to justify how his own obsession with a certain idea of film-making, was the key for his personal salvation, and a blessing for Cinema  I felt like feeling the spirit of the 70's Marty  and even Leo kind of reminded me of Robert De Niro at one point, in a performance that blew me away  'The Aviator' is one of Marty's greatest films!",10,2,3,31 March 2011
Léon: The Professional," A killer as a guardian angel, a cop as the devil and a little girl's soul in jeopardy...
","Luc Besson became the 'it' director ever since he dust French cinema with his 1985 'Subway', embracing the 80's as if it was a new millennium, a time where French movies could look American without it being an overused gimmick. And on that level, 'La Femme Nikita' was his most American-looking film, using archetypes that were even fresh for American audience, interestingly, one of them, from the 1990 hit 'Nikita', would directly inspire his most critically acclaimed movies.Jean Reno played Victor, the cleaner, a hit-man whose specialty was to kill and get rid of bodies through acid. There was something absolutely fascinating in that scene-stealing character, cutting into the grittiness with a cool naturalness that made us wish he could last longer. I guess Besson felt there was a potential for such a character, A hit-man who shoots, hides behind doors, ducks and throws grenades, who can take two, three men and all of this, fitted Besson's predilection for fast-paced action, plural shots and overuse of traveling and zooming and so on. And what a challenge in terms of characterization!Somehow I like the English title even more than plain 'Leon' (though 'Le Professional' was already a classic starring Belmondo). It truly defines Leon, a pro. But he's also a man a bit slow, who drinks milk, takes care of a plant, and loves Gene Kelly. These attributions might feel phony or gratuitous, but they have a point. Reno deliberately made Leon simple-minded and innocent in order to decrease the tension during the intimate scenes between him and Mathilda. He knew if the professional was as vicious in real life as in his job, it would have ruined the movie. So, he played it as someone who'd be in the mindset of a young boy..And on the other side, you have Mathilda, a 12-year old pre-teen, who's seen more than the average kids, she's totally disillusioned, wasted and abandoned in a dysfunctional whose only valuable member is her little brother. Mathilda smokes, sighs, meditates a lot, she exudes the crappiness of life in her words and eyes that betray an inconsolable sadness. When she first meets Leon, she asks him if life is the same for adults, Leon has no encouraging answer. Mathilda is at the messiest time of her life, and somewhere, fate with the hand of a corrupt officer, named Stansfield and played by Gary Oldman, puts Mathilda under the protection of Leon, becoming the closest thing to a friend.And before Mathilda, the only friend Leon had (besides the plant) was a 'mission-giver' played by Danny Aiello, became a sort of father-model for Leon ever since he came to the USA (hence 'ze' accent). It was time for Leon to turn into a fatherly figure himself. And 'The Professional' becomes a wonderful coming-of-age story for both Leon and Mathilda, but to think that it's made with violence and sniper lessons as a backdrop makes the whole experience all the more excitingly disturbing. Contrasts make movies, and 'Leon the Professional' shines with its contrasts.Mathilda is incredibly responsive to Leon's lessons and shows the same interest and curiosity a child would under these circumstances. Leon's action can seem irresponsible, but he's not even capable to answer for himself, he sees himself as the only possible person to provide Mathilda what she needs the most: order and a constructive routine, a reason to be, something to enjoy and affection I guess this is where the trouble starts. Mathilda admits she feels something weird in her guts, she sees Leon as a sort of Oedipal father, there's a weird mix of fascination and attraction. Leon is not interested, as he doesn't even have sexuality in the first place. The plant and the milk gives him an odd purity that prevented the film to shock viewers. Simple, but powerful symbolism!There's something in Natalie Portman that reminds of another child performance from the same year, Kirsten Dunst in 'Interview of the Vampire', both are girls who've grown up fast, and have the look of adults. And when Mathilda sort of gives 'herself' as if she was ready to lose an innocence, it's the cruel admission that she had already lost it, I can understand why this line was cut, but I disapprove, because it all depends on Leon's reaction, and nothing he says hints an interest. The material is rather touchy but it's the reverse side of what made the story works, the man teaching a girl how to be a sniper and the girl playing a 'guess' game with him. When Mathilda plays 'Like a Virgin', it never feels controversial, she's like a teen playing and Leon looks even more childish.It's only when she confronts Stansfield again that she realizes it's not a game, and that indeed some people can be really creepy. 'Do you love life?' he asks. She nods, 'Good because I have no pleasure taking it out from someone who doesn't care'. Why is the cop so creepily violent? We never know, there are things that are better left unexplained, it's part of this weird emotional experience, where a hit-man is like a guardian angel, and a civil guardian angel a devil, and in this urban chaos, a little girl is lost. Besson might have been perceived as the American French director, he injected European cinema in an American movie and this is why it fascinates so much.It is a love story of some sort, but about a true and tender father-daughter love, it's also a coming of age, an action film, a neo-noir, all of this carried by a wonderful acting trio. And if you look at it without thinking too much of the whole killing and shooting, the film might strike a very sensitive chord, and, it's one of the best of 1994, which is saying a lot.",9,1,1,15 January 2016
Bohemian Rhapsody," A tale of self-destructive but uniquely creative showmanship...
","Time will tell whether Bryan Singer's 'Bohemian Rhapsody' will proudly stand among the greatest biopics of its era... but it does help a lot when it's about one of the most gifted and talented artists of his generation and Freddie Mercury IS a legend, though slightly overshadowed by the pop icons of the 80's. Still; there's one thing they won't ever take from Mercury or Queen, and it stands in two words: 'Bohemian Rhapsody'.Yes, one song. One single song is enough to justify their place among the musical Gods. I'll never forget the first time my brother made me listen to it, I knew Queen from 'We Will Rock You', 'We Are the Champions' and forgive me for that, the theme of 'Highlander'. When I first heard 'Bo Rhap', I didn't know what to expect and that feeling went all through the listening: it was both magical and bizarre, whimsical and poignant. I knew I had to listen to that song again, and I did it over and over, to the point I became obsessed. Literally.Like they say in the film: everyone finds its own story in the rhapsody, it doesn't need to have a meaning. Nothing really matters, like the song says. And the biopic depicts a group of four misfits that found each other, on the top of them an exotic looking effeminate man who invented his own fashion and acted like a drama queen, using more 'darlings' than Talullah Bankhead and Cruella DeVil put together; such colorful roles are wet dreams for actors looking for a breakthrough performance.I had my reservations when I first saw a picture of Rami Malek but now I think he should be a lock-up for the Oscar nomination, not that it really matters (any way the wind blows as the song says again...) He's simply unrecognizable as the legendary singer and he never plays his mannerisms as a gimmick but as a deliberate carapace of awkwardness concealing deeper wounds. I guess a modern audience can probably respond to Mercury's antics more than his own generation did but Freddie has that edge over all the Madonnas and Lady Gagas, which is that we can't doubt his sincerity.He was indeed a true and complete artist, with that element of self-doubt and insecurity that made him make the wrong choices and choose a path that would cross AIDS. And that was Mercury, a man who turned everything to his advantage, who was true to himself no matter what and sometimes turned his own blessings into curses. As he says, mistakes, he's made a few... but ultimately, he was the champion of the world. Now, the question is: is the film good because it's about a popular performer and entertainer, could a Queen biopic possibly fail?To put it simply, while all the other characters are slightly meant as pawns in Mercury's life, there are two stars in the film: Rami Malek who gives a performance that does justice to the legacy of Mercury and there's the music, there's no moment in the film that doesn't feature one of them. And much to my surprise there was less lip synching than I thought and the concert performances emphasized the way Malek totally embodied the soul of Mercury, his aura, his body... minus the voice. He is that good.The film treats the singer's origins through a few outbursts of racial slurs (he's called 'Paki' while he's Farsi Indian born in Zanzibar) and scenes with his family that have the tact not to get too melodramatic. We also have the evolution of his feelings and the discovery of his longly repressed homosexuality, perhaps the second most important character is Mary (Lucy Boynton) who inspired the heart-breaking 'Love of My Life'. There's the dry spell, the decadent days and of course, the come-back during the iconic Live Aid concert, maybe the peak of his career and certainly one of the images most associated to the singer.The film ventures in the usual realm of musical biographies, it doesn't reinvent the wheel but why should it anyway? Who needs fancy directing when the show is driven by an eccentric and tortured soul like Mercury. He's a show on his own and I don't envision more than two or three nominations for the film, but at least the so long anticipated biopic was released and maybe it's a star-making role for Malek who looks incredibly convincing. Speaking of that, I also failed to notice Mike Meyers (whose name popped up in the credits) but I'm glad, I'm really glad the film made a subtle nod to 'Wayne's World' because a huge part of the song's legacy is due to its re-use in 1992. Till now, who can resist banging his head at the guitar solo moment?At the end of the film, many viewers were singing a few Queen hits, I was whistling 'Tonight' on the way back home, remembering that even my daughter who's just turned five, loved to listen to the 'mama' song but were scared of the Muppet version. I think there's something unique about Queen, the way they used Rock, opera, Pop and disco sounds, their symbiosis with the audience and the self-destructive yet so creative showmanship of their lead singer. My only regret is that they didn't feature one of my favorite Mercury's songs: 'Living on my Own' (it was begging to be used in the break-up part).The film is far from being perfect, there's something obvious and maybe too linear in its storytelling, even subtly manipulative but it transcend that crooked banality just like a tooth-condition that allowed the legend to reach so many high octaves. How the film succeeds by being so 'predictable', maybe it's because like Queen's music, it just can't be pigeonholed. It's not much a biopic, not much a music movie... it's just a film about Freddie Mercury.And that's enough.",8,1,1,14 November 2018
"Good Morning, Vietnam"," The (live-action) role Robin Williams was born to play...
","'President Johnson says the situation in Vietnam will worsen before it improves'This is the last item of news we catch while we follow Adrian Cronauer's departure from Nam. We've laughed a lot with his crazy and hilarious antics but Lyndon Johnson provided the final punchline to the worst possible joke in a movie full of them: war itself.Calling war a joke is a cliché but it does seem that both humor and war (or politics) rely on absurdity, one taking the edge in the way it takes itself seriously. Whenever we read news about today's political leaders, aren't we all asking the same question after all: 'are they serious?'. A man said that the talent of a politician is to never answer the question, art is not to let them be asked, a comedian works differently: his talent is to ask the right questions, art is to pretend he doesn't even try. Comedians play, politicians dodge, that's the irreconcilable difference between the two worlds, intelligently explored in Barry Levinson comedy-drama 'Good Morning, Vietnam' starring Robin Williams in the closest role to his real personality (and one of his best) as Radio Armed Services DJ Adrian Cronauer.Even the catchphrase 'Good Morning, Vietnam' plays like a wake-up call to the troops, making Cronauer a sensation in 1965 and the target of a few petty officers disapproving his irreverent and raunchy humor. The film focuses on that internal battle with censorship a little more than the actual Vietnam war but to make an even more insightful statement about war, as if the script written by Mitch Markowitz illustrated that iconic statement from Clemenceau that war is too serious a matter to be left to military men. And maybe war is so tragic that extracting any humorous substance from it is the greatest tribute to the human spirit and Cronauer, the man who kept morals high in the infancy of the war with his puns, impressions and redundant 'Good Morning, Vietnaaaaam' accomplished the closest thing to a heroic deed. He didn't save lives but saved them from boredom and alienation.Some people are just born to tell jokes, we forgive them for offending sensitivities because they do it with 'style' and they're so funny they never make it sound like something mean. And the movie draws that line between fun and mean-spiritedness from the way the troops and everyone around Cronauer reacts to his jokes, sometimes, his popularity is overplayed but Robin Williams is such a presence that he gives an extra aura of sympathy to Cronauer. In contrast, there's butt-monkey Lieutenant Hauk (Bruno Kirby) who doesn't get his vulgarity (he'd rather put Polka than Rock'n'Roll) and the fittingly called Dickerson (J.T. Walsh) who doesn't see from in a favorable light this man coming to stir anarchy, forgetting that even in WW2 vets had Tex Avery cartoons, Private Snafu's adventures and other stuff moral would usually reprimand.The film is full of fine supporting performances, including Cronauer's assistant Edward Garlick (Forest Whitaker in his young nerdy years coming back from 'Platoon'), General Taylor (Noble Willingham) a comprehensive man who sees as a priority that his boys have a good time and is perhaps Cronauer's number one fan. And the film proves he's got a good taste, offering the most latitude for Robin Williams to showcase his talent with all the flamboyance and instinct for improvisation he's capable of: a pacing problem with a record, a reference to 'The Wizard of Oz', anything leads to humor. This is certainly his greatest role with 'Aladdin in the sense that it encapsulates all his talent and energy without distracting from the mood of the film, he makes us laugh first so we can appreciate the serious moments.And as viewers, we're more interested to see complexities behind that jovial facade, and see how eventually humor was like a self-defense to cover some deep insecurities. And even that would have been too predictable, the film starts with a man everyone likes immediately but who doesn't have enough perspective on himself. He's slightly cynical, turns everything into a joke, and somewhat we never know what matters to him, he might be as 'annoying' (for lack of a better word) as Robin Williams could be during interviews. Progressively, the film unveils his depths, he has a crush on a Vietnamese girl (Chintara Sukapatana), learns to get along with her brother (Tung Thanh Tran), he teaches Vietnamese people the American slang, befriends a restaurant owner and slowly, the mundane gets over the professional and we start to see the war (and the comedian) from a different perspective, allowing us to appreciate the drama besides the comedy.And the film features many montages mixing music of the era and the war as a backdrop, switching between the fun with Williams dancing to 'I Feel Good', to the more famous 'A Wonderful World' one of the film's most memorable moments. I'm not sure the film is always that effective when it states the obvious things such as war being hell or Cronauer good guy, but there's something so genuinely appealing in Williams' acting that we're able to see the sadness behind his smiles without ever feeling manipulated. Still, no matter how high Barry Levinson's 'Good Morning, Vietnam' aimed in terms of hilarity, it reminds us at the end that humor takes its noblest meaning when it operates within an area that doesn't leave much for laughs; humor is like a dish served on a ugly plate.And perhaps the comedians are men capable to see the worst in humanity before they conjure it with their fun and humor, and maybe the best comedians are deeply the saddest and yet the most capable to give us happiness, like Williams did, like Cronauer did... improving things a little before the situation worsened.",8,1,1,13 July 2019
Burn After Reading," Zany screwball paranoid thriller with faux suspense and real laughs...
","Remember that quote from Bart Simpson about cartoons being just a bunch of hilarious moments with no messages at all?Well, you can believe 'Burn After Reading' says something about the incompetence of secret services, the growing paranoia of the post-9/11 era and how you could make a mountain of nonsense out of the smallest piece of randomness, it's tempting to see some hidden meanings behind the madly elaborate plot, but I'd rather take the 'Bart Simpson' option and see this as another proof that the Coen brothers don't need to conform to any specific style or narrative. In other words, they're just having fun.And why shouldn't they? After 'No Country for Old Men', they probably wanted to get back to their roots and make a screwball comedy à la 'Raising Arizona' without the luxury of a heart-warming subplot, though Frances McDormand's obsession with her plastic surgery carries something poignant despite the ridiculous height her obsession reaches. The Coens had won a Best Picture Oscar with a movie that provided one of their most iconic characters, they couldn't possibly surpass themselves two years in a row, so before turning to more serious movies, they had to make 'Burn After Reading'. I read many critics trying to give it more meaningfulness than it has, but what these critics lack is obvious perspective, when you realize that they made after it their personal masterpiece, 'A Serious Man', you see 'Burn After Reading' as a relaxed step backwards before another big leap. And relaxed seems like the fitting word, it is remarkable how the actors are having fun playing either against type or their usual type to over the top proportions, revealing so many weaknesses and insecurities you realize this is one of these rare instances where a film is only driven by losers, even 'Fargo' had bad-ass state trooper Marge Gunderson played by Frances McDormand.Speaking of this great actress, we know she's never been a sex symbol or bound to pretty glamorous roles, so it's a credit... even if they used a double- to her to set the tone right at the start when we see a doctor checking the flaws of every single part of her body, her floppy underarms, her belly but there's no voyeurism in that scene, nor is it played for cheap laughs. It is the most important scene of the film, because for all the hilarious gags it paves the way to, if the film ever had one pillar, one pattern, one unshakable element is Linda Litzke's desire to have a complete plastic surgery. Unrealistic? My wife wanted a nose surgery ever since I married her, now, she's done it so I could relate to Linda's obsession. Actually, I was surprised by the number of situations I could relate to.The film opens with the firing of CIA analyst Osbourne Cox because of an alcoholism problem and the way the whole scene is played works perfectly. I giggled a little during the interactions between John Malkovich (Cox) and his officer (David Harshe) but then I laughed during the confrontation with his wife, a domineering nagging 'stuck-up bitch' played by Tilda Swinton, accusing him of relying on her money. And I lost it when he said he was going to pull himself together and do some... consulting or that he's always dreamed to be a writer. Anyone who's been unemployed know that 'consulting' and 'writing' are like the euphemism for being a job-less schmuck moving in circles and slippers in your home. Some fancy words to describe the obvious yes, Cox is a loser and his wife makes him even more of a loser, she is just so unbearable, you've got to wonder what Harry found in her.Which takes us to Harry, George Clooney as a man married to a successful children book writer... also a bored womanizer. At first, Clooney plays it like his usual Cary Grant of the 2000's but then he channels the performance of Tom Ewell in 'The Seven-Year Itch , it's fun to see actors playing in or against their own tropes, Tilda Swinton being more stuck-up and pompous than usual or Clooney trying to convince us that he can be a loser too. But the gold medal of playing against type belongs to Brad Pitt, I wasn't fond of his Aldo Raine in' InglouriousBasterds' but 'Burn After Reading' was the perfect platform for an over-the-top comedic performance, as a dim-witted gymnasium Dude who try to play a game too big for him, and endanger his life while a simple smack in his face almost ran him to tears. Pitt's performance is a highlight in a movie, you could tell he was still carried away by his zany persona in Tarantino's movie but it didn't fit.Here it does because the film IS a joke, it's not meant to make a point but to make you laugh, there is some intelligence behind its seemingly pointlessness but there are two key characters in the film who act like a Greek chorus. The officer who fired Cox and his boss played by JK Simmons, their reactions to the current events are just pure bafflement, they're powerless and can only wait for ensuing development. They perfectly embody our position as viewers and while not tying the movie together, the ending provides the perfect punch-line, not that it doesn't end in a rather anticlimactic way, but it's a movie whose McGuffin is a CD that is given more value than it deserves, maybe a clever reference to the film's plot. Who cares of its meaning when it's played for gags? When even a simple picture of Putin hanging in the background make you laugh for no reason.Once again, the only unshakable truth is that Linda wants her plastic surgery, and that's enough to drive a plot, and everyone crazy in the process, Americans, Russian and CIA included.",8,2,3,22 December 2017
The Bourne Identity," The man who knew too much...except who he was...
","Now this is a movie that follows the 'spy thriller' guidelines to the letter.Nothing is missing. A hero in the middle of a worldwide secret conspiracy? Check. Rivaling secret organizations? Check. Skillful martial arts fighting? Check. Improbable and yet heart-pounding car chases with a cool-looking chased vehicle? Check. Speaking of vehicles, a romantic one for the hero? Check too. Cold European locations? Check. And so forth.If it's a genre that's been hard to reinvent since the 'James Bond' movies, it's still one capable to furnish a few little gems. 'The Bourne Identity', directed by Doug Liman, obviously follows the 'Bond' legacy (notice the hero's acronym) but it does so in a way that never fails to entertain even the least likely to be surprised fans. Maybe because it didn't try to surprise.Indeed, instead of going to the 'prestige' road and try to pretend to be smarter than many James Bond film (which 'James Bond' new movies tend to do actually), Liman trusts his material and manages to make a decent and promising thriller, good enough to become the first installment of a successful series. And he lets the script, based on Robert Ludlum's novel, reveals its little tricks, starting with the two novelties in the lead characters.Matt Damon, still looking young enough to pass as Will Hunting, is Jason Bourne, a young man looking for his true identity, and Franka Potente, the 'Run, Lola' girl is Marie, the outsider who finds himself taken in that adventure more or less against her own will. There's a reason for her script in the story, but as far as the film's concerned, we know it's necessary for the hero to have someone to talk to, and Potente always finds the right tone. She's not excited, she's shocked and nauseous about violence but she's intrigued enough by Bourne to trust him and follow him.I know it's tempting to say that the mystery is the reason why the film is capable to hook us, but Bourne's dissociative amnesia isn't exactly a riddle for the ages and there are enough hints about his secret (fighting skills, language fluency...) to figure out that he's not a coal miner. When at the opening, he's fished by Italian boatmen, riddled with bullets and without any memory, I figured it was because of a mental treatment (à la Ludovico) and he was probably a secret agent whose mind might have been brainwashed one bit too many, but the film comes up with a rather simpler explication for the amnesia, so simple that I actually liked it.It reminded me of that moment where Jason gives a detailed but rather complicated plan to Marie in order to gain information about hotel customers and at the end, all she had to do was asking politely. This is a film that has enough self-awareness to never pretend to play it smarter than its audience and till the end, no spectacular twist comes up trying to wow us, nor any overly long climax. In fact, there's no big reveal, we suspect for a long time who Bourne was, the trick isn't to figure out who he is, but just enjoy the the cat-and-mouse chase with the CIA and a few gunmen.On that level, the film isn't overcrowded but what is there is quality. Brian Cox is the CIA Deputy Agent (I guess he'll have a bigger role in the next films) Chris Cooper is Conklin, the man who wants to get a hand on Bourne after an apparent failure during a black operation named 'Treadtstone' and their climactic confrontation is one of the film's greatest moments. Now, I have to give accolades to Clive Owen who, with less than ten minutes of screen-time and only a few lines, steals the show as the cold 'Professor'. Seriously, any actor with the right physique could play the emotionless killer but Owen has a brief exchange with Damon where he injects his own emotionality, and proves that after all, they're still humans with emotion and maybe they don't enjoy it that much. Maybe that's the key of the 'Bourne' film, something I'm beginning to like, people don't enjoy what they do but they have to.Bourne wants to identity until he's having second thoughts about it, but he must escape from his tormentors if he wants to start a new life. Marie doesn't want to follow him and jeopardize her life (or her relatives) but she doesn't feel too hot about leaving him either. Cox' character must answer for a failed job and Cooper's Conklin must get the responsible and punish him accordingly. all about jobs getting done and hierarchical strata. And while James Bond seems to enjoy what he does, Bourne is just going into a direction he's forced in and the real shift occurs when he understands he must be the one calling the cards. And even then, he never acts as if it's fun to have all these skills but he's got them and that's what matters.And that might be what works in the film, it has great special effects, unlikely fighting moves, amusing and thrilling stunts, suspenseful confrontations, and they're all played with the right dose of seriousness and self-awareness, allowing to establish two-and-half dimensional characters for the next installments. In fact, what we get is a well-made thriller, so well I was wondering what would be the harder to believe, the falling from the stairs with enough time to shoot a villain between the eyes or that such a film wouldn't get a sequel",8,2,2,7 March 2020
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," The First Instant Classic Movie of the 21st Century...
","In 2008, the American Film Institute came up with the list of the 10 Greatest American Fantasy Movies of All Time. There was no way 'The Wizard of Oz' wouldn't top this list but guess which newcomer took the second spot that would have belonged to 'It's a Wonderful Life'. Indeed, Peter Jackson's 'Lord of the Rings' is not only the most recent inclusion in any American Film's Institute's List (it is also in the Top 100 Greatest Movies) but it's the highest ranked. It says a lot when a less-than-a-decade old film is literally sandwiched by two classics that are half-centuries older.And 2001 was quite a year for Fantasy; the four highest-grossing movies of the year were the first 'Harry Potter', 'The Fellowship of the Ring', 'Monsters & Inc.' and 'Shrek'. And despite that huge competition, it's the cinematic adaptation of J.R.R Tolkien that became an instant classic in the same vein than 'Star Wars' in 1977. I know 'Harry Potter' deserves a honorable mention but I don't think the series created something as endearing as 'The Lord of the Rings' did, a myth, a saga made of characters that are now parts of pop-culture. And if George Lucas has an edge over Jackson because he created his own mythology, Jackson still took up the most difficult challenge ever: recreating J.R.R Tolkien's universe on the screen. The book, the movie, the involvement that made the transition from one format to another possible are all explained in DVD special features, as long as the movie itself, and I watched them with excitement, because nothing is worthier of admiration than an impossible mission being accomplished, starting with the book. Tolkien was a man of classical education, the same generation than Asimov and Pagnol, brilliant literate minds who studied languages, sciences and translated their academic background into art. Tolkien's specialty was language and when he created his world, he didn't just throw names or drew forms; he invented languages, civilizations, that the appeal of Tolkien, his stories felt real, like belonging to humanity's canon.Sure they venture into fairy-tale territories but his creatures are people with specific cultures and lifestyles and even individually, they are not all the same. You have the Elves who are wise, beautiful and immortal, men who are brave but easily corrupted, dwarfs who are practical and rough mine-workers and of course, the friendly Hobbits and their bucolic happiness. The story centers on the most universal myth of all-time, good vs. evil, with one a small object that can destroy the world and yet seems indestructible. Tolkien meant it as an allegory for machinery and its poisoning effect on the world, but the story is told in the classical epic way, featuring the quest of nine heroes, and the journey of a young Hobbit named Frodo.Frodo, played by Elijah Wood, is the film's 'Luke Skywalker' there's something undoubtedly Obi- Wanesque about the Old Wizard Gandalf, played by Ian McKellen who reveals to Frodo the ring's dark secret, and like Alec Guinness, he was Oscar nominated for his performance, a rarity in Fantasy films. And the performances are integral to the film's success, more than the special effects, more than the production design, the armors and weapons, the Orcs' make-up, the battles' choreographs, if that was enough to make a box-office hit, it takes more to get your three films in IMDb's Top 50, just look at the 'Star Wars' prequels.Speaking of the performances, Ian McKellen displays a wide range of emotion going from the friendly elderly man, to the warm and reassuring friend with Bilbo Haggings (Ian Holm) but he shows who's the boss when needed to. Elijah Wood and Sean Astin have a great chemistry and you cannot doubt over their friendship and the two other hobbits actors know how to play comic reliefs without going over-the-top. The rest of the cast, from Cate Blanchett to Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn all in their characters, with as much sincerity and intensity as if they were trying to grab an Oscar and that proves one thing, they respect the work of Tolkien. The DVD features show them all being interviewed about their experience and you can see in Mortensen, McKellen and the late Christopher Lee (who plays evil Saruman) that they have a sort of fascination and respect for the Master. And rightfully so, it took Tolkien fourteen years to finish the book, and four times more to make a film out of it. Jackson understood why it took so long when he started making the film. He shot it in New Zealand, the perfect place to recreate Middle-Earth, savage enough to look like it belongs to ancient times, then he recreated Hobbitebourg, and the film took form, step by step. And he shot the three films at once, to maintain the feeling of continuity.Jackson's determination, hard-work is as colossal as Tolkien's creation, what he did was objectively impossible, but he embraced the courage of his hobbits, the wisdom of Gandalf, the strength of Aragorn and went on his own journey, making an epic fantasy, a historical war film, and a coming-of-age story, and if Tolkien's 'Lord of the Rings' is promised to centuries of fame, the film adaptation will certainly be responsible for it, because that's what makes a myth last, they're translated into different formats, they adapt to their world. And Tolkien's book was begging for a great cinematic adaptation. And Jackson did it. I know there are purists who think the adaptation doesn't do justice to the richness of the book, but the film is still new, give it time. Think of 'The Wizard of Oz', it was a book, but who can imagine it now without the version of Fleming in mind. Well, in a few decades, 'The Lord of the Rings' will be as iconic as irreplaceable, maybe it already is.",10,0,0,20 October 2016
Grease," Tender Nostalgia of Unlived Times ...
","At a time that confines now to prehistory, when box-office top-tens weren't made of franchises' appointed reboots or frankly disappointing remakes, of Pixar marvels or Marvels pixilation, two school movies could make it in the Top 3 of the highest-grossing movies of the year. From third to first, it was 'Animal House' and 'Grease' (for the trivia, 'Superman' was the second).And these two movies -regarded now as classic- worked because they didn't conflict one to another, each one carried its own spirit and did a damn good job at that. John Landis' 'Animal House' was set in 1962 but was clearly impregnated by a touch of absurdity and a sense of anarchy, obviously too mature for the very time it depicted, like a raunchy and adult variation of something that was closer tone-wise to George Lucas' 1962 in 'American Graffiti'. Granted the actors were all baby-boomers who lived the real 1962, but it was their 1978 selves acting there, no doubt.Things work in reverse for 'Grease', it's set only three years earlier, not a huge chronological leap, but it's an obvious over-the-top, fantasized version of the 50's, one that the cast knew as kids or pre-teens and could only re-enact with a tender nostalgia, which is what 'Grease' is about. There's no way you can watch that 'We Go Together' sequence at the end without feeling some magical sentiment invading your heart. The only proper description I can give (from a guy born four years after the film) is 'paradoxical nostalgia'. Basically, I feel like I lived at the film's time or the release's time, who said Cinema acted rationally anyway?And the reason, I, and I believe many fans who're from my generation, feel that way is because 'Grease' plays the cards straightforwardly and doesn't pretend to be anything else than a good old-fashioned romance and a heart-grabbing musical. Does it sound too reducing? Maybe; but then again, how many romances fail? How many musicals were swept-off by the passing of time? It's not easy, and sometimes, you need two strong protagonists to make it work. In the case of 'Grease', directed by Randal Kleiser (because the director deserves some credit) and I apologize in advance to Olivia Newton-John's fans, I think the film works primarily thanks to John Travolta, who plays Danny Zuko, the cool and handsome T Birds leader.Indeed, if there's anything 'Grease' did, is to have proved some skeptical minds that Travolta wasn't a one-hit wonder, the hit being his success in 'Saturday Night Fever', the cocky disco dancer staggering down New York was meant to 'stay alive'. He had the looks, the charisma and just as he knew how to be funny even in a dramatic way, in the case of 'Grease', he could be serious in a comedic way. Travolta's success wasn't accidental and although he had many ups and downs, he was an actor who could act and move his way out of a good story, so that his persona wouldn't desert the screens forever. Of course, everyone remembers the names of Olivia Newton-John who played Sandy, the sweet and innocent Australian girl falling in love with the bad-boy, macho man and cool greaser, in another take of 'Romeo and Juliet' meets 'Beauty and the Beast' myths, as we all remember Stockard Channing as the scene-stealing Pink Sisters' leader Rizzo and  you know, that actress who played Frenchy it gets tougher, now. I know the rest of the cast includes many nice- looking guys and dolls, 2uko's friend, Kelk.. Kell never mind, the torrid 'Cha-cha' (whom I just learned from Wikipedia that she passed away) but also a first-class list of supporting players who, by their sole presence, pay a genuine tribute to the old days : Sid Caesar, Joan Blondell, Frankie Avalon and Eve Arden, to name a fewBut it's Travolta's movie nonetheless. And he might have half of Astaire's dancing talent or half of James Dean's iconic appeal, but both halves makes a 'one' that oddly surpasses these two legends. And it doesn't shine only during the romantic moments, because like I said, it took two things to make ''Grease' work: a romance and a musical, and I guess the streak of stinkers Travolta had during the 80's was because each time, something lacked. But even when your plot is predictable, all you need are catchy songs and memorable lyrics. 'Grease' has more than needed, and there's never one moment you feel like skipping. From 'Summer Nights' to 'Sandra Dee' from the sweet 'Hopelessly Devoted to You' to the defining 'You're the One that I Want' and the final apotheosis of 'Go Together', every emotion is rewarded, and the fun is always there.'Grease' made it in both AFI's Romances and Musical List with 'Summer Nights' in the Top 100 Songs ('The One that I Want' was unfairly overlooked). The film was the last musical to throne on the box-office and it is the most successful one in history, and almost forty years later, its appeal is undeniable. It might feel laughable in a sort of juvenile naivety whether the two friends pretending to act macho after a hug, the way one gets knocked down by a car door or the whole 'all's well that ends well' finale but it still works. And as I suspect most viewers in 1978 weren't high school kids in 1959; and thankfully, so they couldn't spot the exaggeration, we love the film now for its timeless quality and tender simplicity; one that made the success a series like 'Glee'. That's the power of music, always carrying a personal resonance. Speaking of mine, I remembered spotting during the dance-off the choreography from that Spanish summer hit 'Asereje' and using Zucco as my first nickname when I started chatting (good old Caramail days). That among many other things.Oh yeah; and it was Didi Conn playing Frenchie (thanks, Wikipedia)",8,0,1,3 August 2015
The Caine Mutiny," An entertaining and powerful drama about leadership, discipline ... and strawberries ...
","If there ever was one lesson to learn from 'The Caine Mutiny' is not to take any judgment for granted. Quite simple, isn't it? But this is more thought-provoking than anything you might learn from any war drama of the same period.Indeed, although the film is dedicated to the US Navy, there is no patriotic stuff, no heroic soldiers brandishing the spangled banner and no heart-pounding fight scenes, just a movie using the war as back-story for a more insightful journey featuring flawed men on a flawed minesweeper and, much more, under the commandment of a flawed person, and I use this epithet as an explicit synonym of 'realistic'.Of course, the credit mostly goes to Herbert Wouk, the original novel's author, who won the Pulitzer Price in 1952. Still, Edward Dmytryck, the director, did a good job in his portrayal of the leadership and human interactions' complexities during critical situations, allowing veteran actor Humphrey Bogart to deliver one of his finest performances, rightfully Oscar-nominated, as Captain Queeg, a living incarnation of paranoia, a 'Fred C. Dobbs on the water' if I may say.And Bogart has a fine class of actors to work with, including Fred MacMurray, Van Johnson and Jose Ferrer. I should also mention Robert Francis as Junior Ensign Willie Keith. But Francis departed so early from our world that we'd never know where his brief career would have lead. Surely he was too clean-cut and so unlike James Dean to reach the same iconic status but within the role he was supposed to play, he was convincing as an idealistic newcomer who believes in rules, authority and discipline.Yet, what Keith forgot was that these ideals mostly rely on personality and situations, otherwise, they are just inspirational but empty words. The questions raised by the film are: what to do when under a bad leadership? And mostly, how much of our own responsibility is involved before we indulge to put all the criticism on one person's side? The film works like a naval '12 Angry Men', but manages to display some unsuspected hints of subversive intelligence in the way it misleads our own opinions.It's all about correcting preconceived ideas, starting with the opening anticlimax, when Keith's Ivy-league enthusiasm is undermined by the discovering of the floating mess named 'Caine', where nonchalant sailors work under the commandment of easygoing Captain DeVriess, played by Tom Tully. DeVriess benefits from a huge popularity, an asset that will severely lack after his replacement by Captain Queeg, the man who works by the book, expecting every detail to be exemplary.Queeg sets the tones and ignites optimistic sparkles in Keith's eyes, but they will quickly extinguish as Queeg's personality is progressively unveiled, showing more obvious signs of paranoia, betrayed by his strange habit to play with steel ball bearings. And their clicking noises are like a ticking bomb foreshadowing a devastating explosion. And the series of incidents going on the 'Caine' provide many entertaining moments, whose most defining involving the disappearance of strawberries, a benign case blown out of proportions that will convince the crew of Queeg's inability for leadership. But beware whom you may take side with! Van Johnson as Lieutenant Maryck slowly adopts the position of his friend, the cynical and novelist Tom Keefer, magnificently portrayed by Fred MacMurray, and ultimately, young Keith sides with them. The point is that we start looking at Queeg through their eyes, but it's only a matter of time before the movie provides us a newer mindset, from their lawyer (a scene-stealing Jose Ferrer). There is no word to describe Queeg's speech with the unforgettable 'Aaah, but the strawberries! That's, that's where I had them' followed by a priceless expression on the eyes of the prosecutor (E.G. Marshall) and Ferrer's final toast, except mind-blowing.Still, the film isn't beyond criticism and it has nothing to do with its faithfulness to the book, quite the opposite in fact. In my opinion, 'The Caine Mutiny' suffers from what I call the 'Red River' syndrome. Both are men's movies with rich and multi-layered interactions, yet for some reason, the writers felt the need to inject some romantic subplot, totally random within the film's context. I understand that 'The Caine Mutiny' is an adaptation and the romance played a significant part of the in the process, I guess it's supposed to highlight Keith's maturation BUT that's why we say 'adapted screenplay'.And that's why 'The Godfather' was a masterpiece, because Coppola removed the novel's sleazy details, this is why 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' is a masterpiece, because Forman focused on McMurphy instead of telling the story from the Chief's perspective. Keith might have been the central character of the film, but the story inside the Caine was so thrilling that anything happening outside was useless. I can't believe such a wonderful screenplay with so many three-dimensional and ambiguous characters could indulge to such artificial clichés. Especially since 'Keith' isn't really a flamboyant character, not with a cast that includes Humphrey Bogart, Jose Ferrer or Fred McMurray.Robert Francis is not to blame though, his performance is all right given the character he plays, he's supposed to be the passive observer whom we can identify with. Keith embodied our viewer's position, like the journalist in 'Das Boot', a neutral character whose judgment can only be based on what happens during the film (since it was his first mission) therefore (mis)leading our judgments. I'm not saying I disliked the romance because it was bad but because without it, 'The Caine Mutiny' would've been a true masterpiece, not just one of the greatest dramas of the 50's, which it is, thanks to Ferrer, Bogart and MacMurray, notably during the last ten minutes.And also because I can't resist to a serious film, where no-nonsense grown-ups argue a whole night long about goddamn strawberries!",9,0,1,1 October 2013
The Color of Money," The movie works like 'Hustling' but with reverse effects ...
","Paul Newman is back to the green table to win more and more green billets, but let me ask you something, do you really need colors to know what the color of money is? Paul Newman was 'The Hustler' in a masterpiece of character study, now he's the stake-horse and Tom Cruise's mentor in the sequel directed by Martin Scorsese. Why Scorsese? Well, Robert Rossen's film was a psychological introspection into the concepts of winning and losing, whose effects ultimately alienated Eddie's life. The thirst for victory was Eddie's obsession, and as many tragic antiheroes, it was only through after a tragedy that his soul could find redemption. In a way, 'The Hustler' carried many Scorsesian undertones through this theme of guilt and redemption, so cherished by Marty, so it's only poetic justice if he directed the sequel.But the question is 'did the movie ever need a sequel?' I'm not asking because I didn't like the story, but I liked it less as a sequel. As an independent film featuring Paul Newman and Tom Cruise in a mentor/disciple relationship, the film was OK in my book and provided many spectacular shots. The color of money was one thing, but these balls kicking each other kicked ass, and provided the artistic touch of the film. But as a sequel, a few things really connected this movie to its glorious predecessor, to the point I wondered why they felt the need to name Paul Newman's character Eddie Felson. After all, no reference to Bert Gordon, to Minnesota Fats, to SARAH for God's sake! All these characters sank into oblivion and any attempt to resurrect an ounce of the past vanished in favor of the plot that sinned by its unoriginality, not as a sequel time time, but as a Scorsese film.Martin Scorsese is among my favorite directors, but I'm glad I'm not blinded enough not to differentiate between what I believe to be his great and his more average work. I think he was at the top of his game in the 80's with such powerful dramas as 'Raging Bull', 'The King of Comedy', 'After Hours', with such a streak, 'The Color of Money' should have been a winner, but a winner, it ain't. It' doesn't take a great director and actor to make a film, you need a story, and whatever the original intent was, I fail to see what the insights the movie was supposed to provide were, let alone on Felson whose story arc was satisfyingly closed, so I guess the central character was supposed to be Cruise as Vincent  why not? But as I was waiting for the coming-of-age aspect to finally redeem Vincent, the ending didn't give him much more depth. It's like Vincent embodied the pretentious premise of the film, that just because it's Newman, Scorsese, Cruise, Eddie Felson and pool, the mix would automatically work.Take the game that was the basis of the plot, the 9-shot, nothing against it, but when you consider the rules, you realize how short and nonstrategic it feels, as stated in the opening sentence, its all about luck, right, even luck is art, but I didn't see that in the film. The whole thing was like 'Pool for Dummies', quick, noisy, flamboyant, the film could have even been about bowling, all flash with no substance. And even the smallest attempt to rationalize and to see the film through the relationship between Eddie and Vincent doesn't work, Vince is too cocky and pretentious to make his appeal to Eddie believable, he's nothing like Eddie in 'The Hustler' not even by the 80's standards, and I wonder if the film wouldn't have been more interesting with the character played by Forest Whitaker.Eddie is so better than Vincent that it's not that we can't believe, we don't even want to believe. The movie tries to show Eddie as a character with some wound to conceal, but if it ever was the case, nothing came at the end to reward our patience. And it's a pity, because the actors did a fine job, and I want to mention the great performance by Mary Elizabeth Mastroianno, as the sexy manipulative girlfriend Carmen, now there was a character on the same caliber than Gordon, or Fats, but at the end, it's like her potential is underused, not even for a sentimental dilemma that exceeds the limits of the green table.What was wrong with Marty? When you consider 'Raging Bull', on the surface the movie is a repetition of the same behavior that gets so annoying it gets on our nerves, but it needed the performance of De Niro and the devouring torment of his jealousy to transcend the banality of his character and elevate it to the level of an iconic performance of anger and jealousy. Vince is simply too immature and Eddie too tired to reach that level of intensity, and if only Carmen could inspire a 'Did you (you know) my wife' scene, I'm serious, this is the kind of savor that was cruelly missing in the film.And to conclude, where was the final confrontation between Eddie and Vince, was it too much asking for? Even 'The Hustler' didn't avoid this mandatory conclusion, because this is what we all expect, do we really need to accept Eddie's 'I'm back' for granted? We know he's back but it's time for him to get back to the action, to be the player, not the thinker. That ending seemed too deliberately cool to be believable and makes the whole films look like a long passionless pool game, without even playing the black at the end. Not a bad film, it had the atmosphere, the colors, the flash, the direction, but the film works like 'hustling', with reverse effects ...",7,1,1,11 October 2011
Cast Away," A time-challenger man caught at his own game ...
","What if 'Cast Away' was only focused on the Island sequence? Say, five or ten minutes of exposition, the pivotal plane, crash, the Island and then make it end with the freighter passing by an exhausted Chuck Noland on his raft? Maybe it would have puzzled many viewers but I think the movie would have worked better.That ending would have been the film in a nutshell : a man overcoming the limitations he inherited from comfortable and convenient modernity in order to domesticate wildlife, to make everything we take for granted a challenge worth to triumph over, and to find over patience and intelligence, the strength to go back to civilization. 'Cast Away' was the modernization of the stranded-in-an-Island myth, of the Robinson Crusoe figure, something that was begging to catch the eye of a talented filmmaker, which it did.The before-and-after are only important on a minor screen writing scale, yes we have a character's arc to close, a man who starts as a cocky workaholic employee for FedEx and then discover that there's more in life than stress around the clock, if you try to challenge time, beware that time challenges you (that would've made an interesting tag-line) We've been through that thousands of times anyway, so why wouldn't Zemeckis trust our intelligence and spare us the whole sequence of Chuck 'learning his lesson' while he's back to ordinary life? Indeed, the film is told through Chuck's perspective, like him, we find ourselves confined in a hostile world, after a spectacular crash sequence, we discover the island through his eyes: the loneliness, the silence only covered by the perpetual sound of tides, the darkness only enlightened by the shining stars. It's nature at its most majestic and scary. Then step by stem, through a meticulous and patient directing, we see Chuck trying to get over each step of comfort: finding anything that would make shoes, food or habitat. Anything with what is at hands.And no matter how famous Robinson Crusoe's story is, or how used to Survivor reality shows we are, this is cliché-proof, because although we know it's a matter of time before he learns fishing, before he makes fire or ropes, Zemeckis opts for a documentary-film like precision that keeps our eyes hooked on the 'how' rather than on the 'when'. We don't have time to wonder what will happen when we're fascinated by what we see. And Tom Hanks brings so much naturalness than we share every feeling he has, even the ache on his teeth and the inconvenient self-made remedy he makes, is something we can oddly relate to.The trickiest part of the film is with Kelly (Helen Hunt). She represents his last connection to the real world, but for some reason, I wasn't impressed by the flash in / flash out sequences on her little picture in the pocket watch. She's his love life, okay. He was about to propose her before the crash, got it. But didn't he have parents? Cousins? Friends? The character of Kelly was made like an artificial synthesis of every human relationship in Chuck's life it made the ending even more incongruous, as if Chuck was just a man of his job and a woman. Then having lost one, he had to focus on the other. The romance was too predictable for such an epic start.And I'm sure 'Cast Away' would be regarded as a masterpiece had it focused on the Island, not just a classic film of the early 2000's. The only emotional climax it deserved was the farewell to Wilson. Yes, Wilson! The film's ticket to immortality, a character made of a Volley Ball with a bloody hand that drew a smiling figure, a hazard leading to Chuck having finally someone to speak to. Wilson confirms what was hinted in the pilot's burial sequence, a man needs to be a man, and one of the first manifestations of civilization were funerals. A man needs abstractions, he needs to communicate and that's what Wilson is, and we're so in-line with Hanks performance that we take Wilson as a person too, and his disappearance is heartbreaking.And it was necessary, because that was the only way for Chuck to lose the ultimate connection with the Island, to be normal again. At one point of dementia, he was almost going to drown just to catch a damn volleyball, this was the final test before finally getting back to his senses, and waiting for either death or a boat to catch him. The death of Wilson, so to speak, was the only possible climax. Having Chuck getting back to life and discovering all its insolent accommodations of modern life, sleeping on the ground, having troubles is important on a broad way, but not within the context of the film.So, why not leaving that for our imagination? I thought a man like Chuck would become an instant celebrity, would publish a book, would understand Kelly getting married, would get back to his family etc. etc. Oddly enough, Hanks plays the second Chuck like a kind of Forrest Gump whose slowness would result from that trauma. It's like watching a whole other film. A pity that the film gets drown in cinematic conventions for a concept that asked for more simplicity and straightforward narrative, and I suspect the film would have garnered more awards and nominations had it focused on that, and if Zemeckis was so eager showing the aftermath, then make a two-part movie and leave the Island for this one.The Island sequence was enough to make a masterpiece or in other words: why would you put a cliché kiss-in-the-rain scene in a film where the most memorable relationship and interaction is between a man and a volleyball !!!",8,0,0,23 March 2015
The Thing," If you think the original is good, you've got another 'Thing' coming...
","In 'Night of the Living Dead' (spoiling paragraph), the lone survivor ended up being shot as randomly and mercilessly by a posse gunman who didn't even give him time to say 'I'm not like them!'. The guy looked like a racist asshole but we can ask ourselves if the emergency or the pressure were too big to take a chance. One of the most wicked aspects of John Carpenter's 'Thing' is to make the gunman's point in a way that brilliantly betrays our own inclination to distrust.It starts with a helicopter firing gun at a running sled dog in Antarctica, we can't sympathize with the shooter, and when the dog makes it to that camp, we're almost relieved. Then the helicopter lands, and the man with the rifle, a Norwegian, starts shooting again uttering incomprehensible words for the camp members, all American. Of course, he was warning them about the dog, but he didn't realize he was endangering himself and a bullet hit him before the realization. Garry (Donald Moffat) isn't your typical trigger happy guard but he didn't trust the Norwegian. This is distrust's establishing moment as the pattern-instinct that will drive the plot and command most actions.Lack of trust or refusal to trust... the merit of John Carpenter is to have brilliantly exposed one of humanity's most detestable traits in a powerfully metaphorical story brilliantly dressed up as a horror movie but closer to the spirit of the original novel 'Who Goes There?'. Indeed, to call 'The Thing' a remake is an insult, if anything this film highlights the limitations of its predecessor. While in the black-and-white film, the all-clean-cut American team had all their members sticking together against a clearly identified Frankenstein-like enemy, here, you'd better not watch the skies but anyone around you, which is enough to fuel the atmosphere with pure paranoid terror.Literally, they had another 'Thing' coming, the alien has no place to hide except for hidden organisms, which means dogs or eventually humans whose shape it can imitate and recreate. The original tag-line said 'Man is the warmest place to hide' before it was stupidly changed to 'The Ultimate Thing in Alien terror' milking on Ridley Scott's success while the film was a whole new experience by making humans the potential containers of the ugly creature. Carpenter reconciled between Scott and Romero's concepts with the background of the 1951 film more convincingly restored, and the result is both visually stunning and captivating. Even the cold and the solitude were powerfully rendered. Hell, even the dogs act well.Yet the film was criticized for its overuse of gory effects. Personally, I thought they were so spectacular and effective they should have beaten 'E.T.' ('The Thing' wasn't even nominated) as if Spielberg reinvented the wheel after 'Star Wars' or 'Close Encounters'. It's not just about the practical effects but the way the corpses and hybrid-versions of the Thing looked like real biological structures in their gruesome and grotesque way and pushed repulsiveness to eleven without undermining the realism. On the contrary, they made the original lose any credibility with its 'man in suit' villain. The film was also criticized for its lack of characterization and this is why I have to play the devil's advocate again. Granted Kurt Russell plays the bad-ass hero with the right intuitions and the other cast members seem to fulfill a few archetypes, there's never a moment where the acting feels unrealistic, everyone is aware that they are in a situation where splitting up is the worst option yet the turns of events always force them to split up causing the suspicions to reappear, it's not contrivance, it's brilliance in a twisted way. And by the time Blair (an unrecognizable mustache-less Wilford Brimley) realized the apocalyptic implications of the Thing, it was too late, and even with a buddy-system, they couldn't trust each other under that eschatological pressure. It's easy to sit as viewers and be all analytical about it, but maybe some of us would have hidden in the safest place to avoid any contact, hence endangering ourselves even more. I think the film played it real enough so I could find it plausible... starting with defensive moves that enhance the danger and then strategies to sabotage the Thing's plan while leading to other tricky situations. And everything leads to that sequence where Charles Hallahan's belly literally snatches Richard Dysart's arms and the head turns to a spider-like monster, this scene is delightfully hideous, so is its enthusiastic retelling in the 'making of' film. We've reached the film's high point and it's immediately followed by the blood test; perhaps one of the most riveting and suspenseful moments from any horror movie. It's not just in the outcome but the way eyes' glances and death glares are exchanged and when you see this scene a second time, you realize that the 'trusting' issue is the spice that makes the meal so delicious. They don't want to trust each other but the most nightmarish aspect of their situation is that they must do it. And to close the 'trusting' arc in the most satisfying way, you've got to love the final exchange between Russell and Keith David, when they realize that they've reached a point where trusting isn't an issue anymore and it's time to share a peace-pipe-like JB bottle. That scene might echo the perception the film received when 'E.T.' was praised for its more friendly visitor and universal message; but retrospectively, 'The Thing' has just as much depth, as strong visuals, and if not the box-office gross of 'E.T.', it finally earned a wonderful afterlife elevating it among the classics of the genre... and deservedly so!",9,2,6,3 May 2018
The Revenant," After a second thought, I'd rather rewatch 'The Martian'...
","In 1823, in the wild Northern Plains of America, trapper Hugh Glass, played by never-Oscar-winning Leonardo Di Caprio, is savagely attacked by a bear, in a scene that became an instant buzz-maker and as far his (mis)adventures would go, only the starter. Indeed, he later witnesses the killing of his half-Native son by the bad guy, Fitzgerald (played by Tom Hardy) and is left for dead in the freezing forest, with a body so severely mauled he can hardly breath, speak, or walk. Glass crawls his way out to the next river and then begins the harrowing journey of a man within an inch of life, but an eternity on the scale of his revenge. The only character I can recall who went through a worse situation in a film was a certain Jim Caviezl in a Mel Gibson's Biblical film. As hackneyed as it sounds, 'The Revenant' is one of these films the expression 'cinematic experience' was invented for. It is a survival-into-wilderness tale that elevates the word 'pain' to unexplored territories, not even 'Cast Away', and certainly not 'The Martian'. I complained about co-nominee Damon not having enough scenes to show the 'physical' struggle of a man trapped in a hopeless situation but if I had to rewatch a film, I guess I'd still go with 'The Martian'. I know no performance came close to Leo's and his Oscar win is as a mathematical certainty as the Titanic sinking. But there's a limit to how long a performance mostly made of suffering, grunting and agonizing can please you, no matter how good it is. François Truffaut said 'a movie should either show the joy or the agony of making the film', now, talk about overkill.And Leo gets the lion share of recognition, and the awards... poor Caviezel didn't work with the right director. Speaking of whom, Inarritu and cinematographer Lubeski also deserve credit for overcoming the technical difficulties that undermined the shooting, from the weather to the lighting (even if it's not difficult to make beautiful cinematography out of beautiful landscapes). There's something in Inarritu's directing that literally made 'nature' alive and watching 'The Revenant' was like penetrating the hostile wilderness, feeling like the pelt-trappers waiting for an arrow to erase one of us from life. Those were the unsettled days where men with greed by way of bravery, paved the way to the conquest of a yet unknown America. This 'unknown' feeling is conveyed in the opening sequence that reminds of the landing massacre in 'Saving Private Ryan', where you know the quietness of nature is only the omen of an imminent violence. And from the graphicness, you know it's not a 'savage' vs. 'civilized world' thing, it's just men protecting their possessions, expressing their natural instinct, like Glass protecting his son from the suspicious eyes of the other trappers or the mother bear attacking Glass to protect her cubs. What I own, I protect. I liked that aspect. And this is why 'The Revenant' didn't need the surreal moments, where Glass is haunted by the visions of his deceased wife, like in 'Gladiator' (a part I didn't like either). A film of such sober ambitions on the field of storytelling shouldn't indulge to usual supernatural 'interludes', especially when they're so expected in Native-themed movies.Actually, I'm not even sure the film needed the revenge either, which was a first departure from the real story. Apparently, there was a need of a human antagonist, as the unscrupulous and manipulative Fitzgerald. So, for all its harrowing visuals, the film sticks with the classic 'good vs. evil' thing. Still, Tom Hardy adds a lively touch to a rather introspective film. He's menacing, truly intimidating and sometimes, his eyes speak more than his actions, so despite the verbal richness of his role, he still says more with his eyes, and looks like a ferocious beast who'd never hesitate to attack when smelling the danger. The final confrontation, although conventional, is like the recreation of the bear scene, proving that once you hit a man's deepest instincts, the beasts inside awakens. What I own, I protect, and for what I protect, I kill. And it's only when he remembers the words from a Native helper that Glass stops acting like an animal. And this is when you get the meaning of the title. 'The Revenant' carries this come-back notion, but it also has to do with the French translation as 'revenant' is a 'soul' or a 'spirit'. Hugh Glass is much alive, as he carries the soul of a deceased family, and it's his connection to the world of the dead that keeps guiding him in his road for survival and his quest for justice. It's powerful, but did we need to have it said, on the nose? Now, what lies behind this last shot? Maybe the sadness of a man whose soul can rest now, but whose heart is still tormented. An end that is waiting for a new beginning? A sort of 'what now?' I'm still puzzled by that last shot, but I think there's an interesting correlation with Leo's role, so much has been said about it: he swam in cold waters, ate a raw buffalo liver, and went through the most painful extreme, he'll get his overdue Oscar, and he'll never have a more difficult role. So what can he do after? Well, I just want to conclude in a lighter tone and say 'give him the Oscar and give him a break, and a few fun roles in movies that express –this time- the joy of making a film.'",7,1,5,21 February 2016
Bridge of Spies," The Bridge over the Torn Curtain...
","In the midst of the Cold War paranoia, Jim Donovan (Tom Hanks) a lawyer specialized in insurance settlement is assigned to defend KGB spy Rudolf Abel, Mark Rylance in a performance that will deserve a few words. This is less a trial than a tactic to prevent the Soviet Union to politically exploit Abel's arrest: Abel's case must show the world that USA treated him democratically. But that's only a cover, what Donovan ignores. Like so many characters who populated Hanks' filmography, Donovan is a decent man and much more, a professional. He takes his job seriously and when he discovers that much of the evidence was found without search warrants, he even wants to call a vice of form.So, what we get is a highly respected lawyer, with an Irish name, a respectable family, and a 'Red' who might have pulled a Rozenberg in his actions and be the cause of New York's imminent nuking, in the minds of millions of Americans or kids, constantly brainwashed by these Nuclear mushroom images (you know these 'duck and cover' programs). Naturally, Abel's public image inevitably spills over Donovan who worries everyone from his family to his colleagues, from the prosecutors to the judge, and his zeal doesn't help. That, alone, would have been the premise of a terrific movie, the contradiction of a man who does his job, out of decency and patriotism and is almost treated like a traitor. To think that there were supposed to counter-attack the Russian propaganda is one of these film's many subtle delights and it doesn't come as a surprise, that within this whole paranoid craze, you have these two men who seem to speak the same language.It is not a friendship in the cinematic sense of the word, but it's a story of respect between two men who know the context they live in, their duty, their limitations, but still, find a 'bridge' of communication, through such simple matters as honor, principles and humanity. Rylance's performance looks like a one-note one, but don't get mislead, this is a man who was trained not to show any emotions, to keep a low-profile, so it's only through his eye-language, and a few words, that you can get to the core of his feelings. He says he's not afraid of the electric chair, but his stoicism is later counterbalanced by the 'although it wouldn't be my first choice'. This is not some robotic spy, this is a human being who's also caught in the requirements of his job. And his attitude, if not the public's, earns him Donovan's everlasting sympathy.Tom Hanks, as usual, doesn't need to speak loudly his emotions, we can see that from the way he exchanges looks with Rylance, and after Abel's sentence, he pleads to Supreme Court arguing that there's no way, the USA should treat dishonorably a man who's only following a fighter's code the same way that America wished his men would follow the Constitution. There has to be a reciprocity of actions and treatments, not just in the weapon department. And what could have been a terrific climactic speech is only the precursor of the second act of the movie. Of course, there was no way, Abel would be found innocent, he wasn't anyway, so the film had to move to higher levels, and it does.It's interesting that Donovan worked in insurance, this is a man who made a living out of predicting odds, and in 1957, it didn't take the highest insurance exec to guess one American spy might be arrested once, and Abel could be used as a bargaining chip. His eloquence convinces the judge and Abel escapes from the Rozenberg treatment, and of course, it pays off, as a spy pilot, Gary Michael Powers, is shut down while traveling above the Soviet territory on U-21 plane. Donovan is then entrusted to negotiate the exchange of prisoners, which would've been a formality if it wasn't for a little twist: the arrest of an American student in Berlin while attempting to get his girlfriend to the West Side. When Donovan learns about this arrest, he can't imagine going back to America with only one person. The film turns into a very interesting chess game where Donovan must hit two birds with one stone, he must convince the Soviet and the East-German representatives, understand their motives, express his, and make the timing his ally, rather than an obstacle. It's a heart-pounding race against the clock.Although Steven Spielberg isn't renowned for being the most subtle director when it comes to emotions, his recent 'Lincoln' was a signal that the tone of his movies abandoned their usual sentimentalism to some more mature material. Lincoln was less the noble-hearted hero than a positively Machiavellian tactician, and this is what Donovan is. And he plays the diplomatic game perfectly, learning how to be mild-mannered or firmly resolved, in the middle of a Cold War that wasn't just symbolically cold. This leads to a wonderful climax, whose first element of surprise is to reveal that the film's title wasn't just a metaphor.Now, I read many comments accusing the film of being another propaganda movie. I would say it's more of Capra-like movie in its spirit. Besides, wasn't Abel the most fascinating character of the movie, and a hero to some extent? Weren't the Americans as eager to hang Abel as a Western mob to lynch a cattle thief, and didn't one of the CIA guys even care of the American student? In fact, 'Bridge of Spies' is beyond these considerations, it is less a thriller with two antagonistic sides, than a great character study with two similar men united by their patriotism and their sense of duty. And no matter how different the lifestyles are, two systems making such men possible can't be that bad.",9,3,5,17 February 2016
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," A different 'Harry Potter' and an exciting set-up for the final fight...
","'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part I' took up many difficult challenges such as tying up elements from the previous chapters together while not relying on expectations from fans with encyclopedic knowledge. Speaking for myself, as a 'newbie', I enjoyed that penultimate film for what it was: an entertaining action-packed opus full of quiet and engaging moments.The film also prepares us to a spectacular finale people have been waiting for during half a decade (half a month for me) without exhibiting any hurry to get into it, as if it took the proper time to tell its own story and as if the last book was too important to condense it into a three-hour format.Now, there are additional objects of praises: the film allows us to get us a full view on every character who took part in Harry Potter's journey: Hagrid, the two good Defense Against the Dark Arts Teachers Rupin and Moody, the Weasley family (including Harry's sweetheart Ginny). And yet the film essentially focuses on the Power Trio: Harry, Ron and Hermione, taking them to locations they've never been in, as if the priority was to evacuate a few demons and seal their friendship first before they would find the definite strength in unity, to combine with the skills cumulated over their adventures at Hogwarts. I liked that aspect of the film.And by the time it ended after two and half hours, I totally forgot there were still four or three Horcruxes to find and many obstacles paving the path to Voldemort. I don't know how this is going to be handled in Part II, especially in two hours and ten minutes (a rather short time by the series' standards), but I can't wait for the final round of the 'Harry Potter' series, a saga that defined a decade and where we literally saw three kids growing up before our eyes, while their world of wonder faded out, making way to the Dark Side.Yes, long gone is the whimsical wizardry and its streams of spells and curses. The crucial moment occurs in the first act when Harry leaves everyone after the death of a few regulars (no need to spoil their name but surely you didn't expect a clean death toll?). He's intercepted by Ron who tells him to get off his high horse and stop thinking as the chosen one; this is no melancholy time when the Evil force commits mass killings and kidnappings, it's time to fight and everyone is on the same boat. Ron developed some maturity like Harry facial hair and he found the properly humbling words.Which takes me back to the first film, I remember my first question was 'what is a Muggle?'. I initially thought the series was set in parallel universes (sort of) and there had to be zero interference between. 'Deathly Hallows' opens with a nightmarish apocalyptic vision à la 'Dark Knight' proving that not only the Muggles aren't immune to the wrath of Voldemort and his minions but that they're targets as well. And speaking of Voldemort, from the table scene reuniting all the main villains, with him as the master of ceremony, we also understand that the line between good and evil is now clearly drawn.There are degrees of vileness though, some are more reluctant than others, but when you look at the top 'management', you know no quarter won't be asked. 'Deathly Hallows' is different in tone but made me retrospectively understand the tragic climaxes of the previous chapters, it was all leading to it. Whether J.K. Rowling had that scenario in mind when writing the first book, one can be dubious, but there was no way that such a set-up couldn't lead to a larger-than-life exploration of the dark side of wizardry.And not only the film inspires such expansion but it also allows us to have a subplot revealing the deepest motives of Voldemort: his quest for the Deathly Hallows, three old relics that might allow him to become the Master of Death and whose symbol echoes some conspiracy imagery. Rowling had a wide enough universe and such a rich gallery of characters she had quite a toolbox to build an inventive adventure, but she still had room for new stuff, including the infiltration of Voldemort in the Ministry of Magic through a corrupt member named Plus Thicknesses (Guy Henry).But the heart of the story is the adventure in the wilderness lived by Ron, Harry and Hermione sealing their friendship and testing their mutual trust. There are moments of tension (sometimes sexual), moments of fun and relief and there's also a part where they simply walking down the street in London (and I expected a Rowling cameo). I appreciated that for all its richness, the film didn't get too thick and took the time for some long panoramic shots and extended scenes with the trio, as a last brief halt into our most beloved characters before the final action.There was action all right in the first and ending sections but this is a film quietly introspective and often captivating. I concede sometimes, many devices seemed too far fetched but the pace is so fast that you don't have time to step back and think of the flaws, our minds are set in the quest for the Horcruxes and the defeating of Voldemort. And the series has turned into such a dark tone that for all I know, Harry might lose the fight or have a Pyrrhic victory.I personally believe the film owes us a happy ending by now so I'm looking forward to have my expectations fulfilled in 'Part II'.",8,0,0,29 November 2018
Kung Fu Panda 2," From a comically 3D to an emotionally three-dimensional character...
","In every good sequel, there's a little bit of prequel and 'Kung Fu Panda 2' is another proof that DreamWorks knows how to handle sequels, especially the second ones. If you look at 'Shrek 2' or 'Madagascar 2: Escape to Africa' you'll notice the same pattern, they exploit the back-stories of the main characters for their individual development and for the plot. The premises of Shrek meeting Fiona's parents or Alex the Lion discovering his roots in the savanna inspired entertaining and emotional stories. And if I was more entertained by 'Madagascar 2', I was certainly more emotionally involved by 'Kung Fu Panda 2'.The film opens with an expected narration, the tale of the peacock lord of the city of Gongmen who had troubles with his son, Shen, a soothsayer predicted that if he went to rule the city, he'd bring chaos and desolation by turning fireworks into a weapon, but he'd ultimately be defeated by a creature in black and white. Shen hears the prediction and pulls an Oedipus by destroying the peaceful panda. Actually, it was Jocasta, Oedipus' father who sealed his fate by abandoning his son but never mind, we know the film will finally give an answer to the biological difference between Po, the panda and his father, the goose. What was a funny sight gag inspires a very poignant story.Indeed, the sequel gives an unexpected dimension to a character who was supposed to be droll and funny, and with the voice of Jack Black, it's hard to take him seriously, but as the plot advances, and we have more glimpses on Po's past, we start to take the film more seriously than the first, 'Disney' serious. The comparison is not fortuitous, when I saw the flashback sequences drawn in quite a beautiful 2D animation; I thought it would have fitted the film as well as 3D. I understand the animators took for granted that 3D would be the best vehicle for action sequences and spectacularly acrobatic move but the highest spots of 'Kung Fu Panda 2' owed nothing to 3D.There's no denial that action is integral to the franchise's appeal, but the origins of Po were enough to turn him into a fully three-dimensional character (in the nobler meaning of the word), the scene where he finally confronts his adoptive father carries some powerful emotionality. And besides the hero, the film had the worthy villain: Lord Shen, voiced by Gary Oldman, a self-centered peacock whose childhood trauma nourished hatred, anger and a constant obsession for power and mass destruction. With the help of an army of wolves, he decimated Po's village, had his mother killed and created such a powerful weapon it could make Kung Fu as useless as a peashooter.Lord Shen is a very hard to beat villain, literally, and the film surprisingly features many confrontations between him and the Five-now-Six Warriors, it's almost one hour and half long, but there's not a moment wasted, except some action sequences that are a little overblown. The length also allows to explore the personalities of the other warriors but again it's Tigress (voiced by Angelina Jolie) who takes the 'lion' share of interactions, and there's a word that is used so many times it becomes some sort of running-gag. She's called 'hardcore' because she's so cold and bad-ass in the same time, her capability to hide her feelings almost equals her fighting skills, but whenever Po's life is at stakes, she reveals a sweet and maybe fragile side of her, is there more than friendship and respect? There's no time to figure because Po's vulnerability was the main point and he had more urgent things to do, and when he gets to the final confrontation with Shen, the dark flashback that reveals Po's past seals the coming-to-maturity of Disney's rival, as even the buffoonish panda can make your heart melt. But DreamWorks animators have a talent of their own; they know how to 'copy Disney without copying it'. Let me explain: in 'Shrek', the Beauty becomes the Beast after the kiss of true love, in 'Madagascar 2', Alex doesn't follow Simba's example and 'remembers who he is', but sticks to what he is inside without any blood predestination. In 'Kung Fu Panda 2', when Po learns the truth, he doesn't jump to kill Shen, but finds the inner peace so he can dodge his secret weapon and uses the fireballs like drops of water (good call on the continuity).Still, there was more than a MacGuffin in that 'inner peace' thing, it showed that Po stayed true to himself; he defeated Shen but didn't want to kill him for what he did to his parents. But we all know that a villain of such cruelty can't be forgiven by the laws of animation, so Shen pulls a desperate fight and is defeated for once and all. The team triumphed and Kung Fu will prosper, but more than that, Po declares his love to his friend and to his Dad, and the ending almost had me in tears and I wish it could have closed that way. The last ten seconds were in my opinion the only useless thing about the film, granted they wanted a cliffhanger or gives us a foretaste of the third opus but why showing Po's dad alive? All the animosity we built toward Shen is because he was an evil dude who killed a whole village and decided to take over China, that evilness was quite understated by the last shot. I wouldn't have cared about this detail if the film was average, but it was so awesome, I wish it didn't end like that.",9,0,1,26 August 2016
American Psycho," The dark side of vain masculinity, unveiled by Mary Harron ...
","I was 27 with high enough a salary to be a chain-dater, taking girls to the same expensive restaurants, especially one with the best panoramic view on Casablanca. My face became familiar to the waiters and they did a good job pretending it was my first 'visit'. I could bring girls regardless of any intentions to build a relationship; what mattered was the status. Two evenings could cost me a tenth of my salary but it was worth it. And that's the degree of vanity to which I could relate to Patrick Bateman, 26, embodying that point of a man's life where the more he eats, the hungrier he gets.'American Psycho' is set in the 80s but things haven't changed much; in the 2010s, we could all have a nice girlfriend and yet keep on lusting on that sexy profile on Facebook. Maybe the late twenties is an age where the manly ego roars too loudly to listen to reason, maybe there are so many possibilities that we're more likely to make decisions lingering on fantasies rather than reality, moreover in a time where sex is trivialized by porn and violence by pop-culture, which 'American Psycho' shows (as opposite of 'tells').The film, adapted from Bret Easton Ellis's novel and directed by Mary Harron, is about that state of vanity driven to its more extreme and disturbing form. Here is Bateman's existential dilemma: should he surrender to the comfort of conformism at the risk of becoming a mediocrity (in his own terms) or acting free in the name of a supra-individuality that puts him above everyone else? The film is set during the Reagan-era and centers on arrogant yuppies who measure success by their capability to get the best tables, the most exotic meals and fulfill any kind of sexual fantasy. And Patrick Bateman is the most troubled of them: he's attractive, articulate but his moments of social adequacy are punctuated with anxiety driven by jealous rage.But the weirdest aspect is less in his behavior than the way it keeps getting unnoticed. It's very telling that the final line of the film is 'That confession meant nothing'. Many movies tend to use violence to make a specific comment against society, channeling 'Taxi Driver' or 'A Clockwork Orange' (there's even a scene that echoes Kubrick's film where Bateman confronts a homeless man) but in 'American Psycho', violence says more about the perpetrator and the environment that can't perceive him as the degenerate man he is. It's not about the vanity of men who reached the top but the way they are seen as perfectly compatible with civilization although they're acting below animals, it's like a more cynical version of 'Being There' with Peter Sellers.'American Psycho' can also be regarded as an alternative to 'Fight Club'. In Fincher's film, men compensated the vacuity of their lives by uniting and draining their energy from their survival instinct, with a collective voice, and rejecting capitalism because it rejected humans in the first place. Harron's perspective shows men who exist individually, but whose existence are lead at the expenses of a social conscience, or any conception of love or family. It's all about consumption, competition, buying, eating, trading, a world where even women are treated like products whether prostitutes or strippers or disposable fiancées. These men didn't fight the system but embraced it, men being wolves to men.Patrick Bateman took it a bit too literally: anyone above him is a dead man, anyone who admires or loves his Alpha aura might get away, someone with no goal whatsoever, no philosophy of life, deserves to be killed. Destruction is what connects both 'Fight Club' and 'American Psycho' but if in the former, the mayhem was supposed to build a new order, the message was still contradicted by its homoerotic undertones and its constant gaze on Brad Pitt's beautiful abs. The film was tantalizing our voyeuristic tendencies. We get the same gaze on Bale, when he's taking a shower and narrates his cosmetic morning routine, but it's devoid of passion, it's cold and soulless and his naked body is often associated to scenes of horror that connects between the two worlds of fantasy: violence and nudity. It's just as if the real motive of the 'Fight Club' was to create a sense of belonging, to build a collective male body instead of restoring justice.Mary Harron deconstructs the myth of masculinity through the portrayal of many metrosexual men as self-important and gossipy as the Beverly Hills housewives. Bateman has everything: a steady and gratifying job, a huge apartment in New York, a beautiful fiancée (Reese Witherspoon) and yet he's devoured by a constant urge to destroy whatever can spoil this feeling of perfection, even someone whose business card looks better. The film blends toward horror and comedy with rather gruesome episodes, but there's never any attenuating circumstance, Bateman has no moral alibi. He was raised by pop-culture, Reagan, and considers killing something as casual as ordering a hamburger.It might be the extreme point from which we understand the inconceivable: why would someone who'd accept that thousands of people die from a transaction accept to be ethical? Why would someone who's at the top of the human pyramid, decides to have casual sex with an average Jane or accepts marital commitment? Why would he indulge to normal behavior? That's the point, the higher climb as a man and the looser will be your sense of moral, (look at the Weinstein or Epstein scandals) and maybe Bateman, whether he commits the actual crimes or dream of them, is the embodiment of both masculinity and capitalism dark side.And Bale's extraordinary performance is crucial because he never tries to make his character sympathetic when he confronts us to our potential for degeneracy and hypocrisy. 'American Psycho' is an underrated 2000s film, oddly prophetic, revealing new depths at each viewing.",8,3,4,9 March 2020
Little Miss Sunshine," The inspirational effect of 'Rocky' combined with the irresistible charm of an early-season Simpson episode ...
","'Little Miss Sunshine' is one of these unexpected gems like only Cinema can produce and definitely, one of the most defining and endearing films of the last decade. I so would have loved to see the independent-spirited underdog win over the conveniently acclaimed Scorsese's 'The Departed' but 30 years after 'Rocky', times have changed, and there's no place for 'little' movies anymore. But since I learned one thing from 'Little Miss Sunshine' is to see the bright side of life, I'm confident that in 30 years, 'Little Miss Sunshine' will be regarded as an immortal classics with the same appeal than 'It's a Wonderful Life' or 'Back to the Future' and the picture of the family running and jumping in the yellow Peugeot van as one of the most iconic of American cinema  When Family films were reduced to a bunch of sappy moralizing dramas or brainless comedies where kids outsmart the parents, 'Little Miss Sunshine' resurrected the genre with a sweet, touching and intelligent comedy-drama involving a dysfunctional but united family, the Hoovers and an inspiring but not patronizing message about 'winning'. I hope the non-fans won't take the comparison too literally but I found that the film had the same appeal than a touching Simpson episode from the earlier seasons, and I guess my reference is also inspired by the heart-warming yellow that defines the film's sunny mood, putting a little sunshine in our hearts with so many touching moments. More than the triumph of a film, it's the triumph of a spirit, conveyed by a beautiful score and a clever Oscar-winning script.What's the secret of 'Little Miss Sunshine', the special little thing that makes the difference? I believe the movie's greatness relies on the performance and the characterization of Olive, by Abigail Breslin, so naturally balanced between smartness and innocence that the perfect note was found to provide a character the kids could identify with. Breslin plays a little girl excited to be selected in the 'Little Miss Sunshine' contest, which might be surprising because this kind of competitions are infamous for having girls posing and acting like 'little women'. But Olive is determined, she prepared a secret number with Grandpa Edwin (Alan Arkin), Richard, the father (Greg Kinnear) preaches the concept of winning in his conferences and Sheryl (Toni Collette) is the kind of loving mother that would do anything to please her daughter. Olive is the emotional core of an order that would collapse without her. Indeed, without Olive, the whole unity and solidarity of the family is undermined, the grandpa is a foul-mouth and pervert old man, the father is alienated by his own theories, Dwayne, Olive's brother has made a vow of silence to fulfill his dream to become a pilot and expresses the thoughts of his implosive anger in a notebook and Frank, the step-brother, played by Steve Carell, is a homosexual literature expert with suicidal impulses and as he loves to remind, the number one fan of Marcel Proust. And it's up to Sheryl, the mother to deal with all these personalities in the road to the 'Little Miss Sunshine' contest, and the plot is so well constructed that they all must go together, starting a touching road movie in which all these egos, all these stories' arcs will converge with each member of the 'Little Miss Sunshine' family having one moment to shine, through laughs, cries, breakdowns  poignant outbursts of strong and vulnerable humanity.And this leads to the other secret of 'Little Miss Sunshine', it's a movie for outsiders. In the road, it's hard to imagine that this cute chubby girl with glasses stands a chance in a beauty pageant, but in a way, we don't really care about the result, since we already have in mind that the film isn't about winning, it's about letting your little voice be heard. And in the family, each one represents a part of human personality that finds something difficult to communicate, the frustrated number two, the insecure teenager, the blinded know-it-all, the grumpy old guy, they are less stereotypes than representations of the little differences that poison the lives but enrich the world, or vice versa. And when Olive is confronted to the girls in the pageant, we realize how the girls all look identically 'artifical' while Olive is clearly the only visible one.'Grandpa, am I pretty?' candidly asked Olive. This question touched something deep in my heart as it summarizes our own fear of not being accepted. Olive is confronted to a double dilemma, losing because she wouldn't be pretty, and disappointing her father, Grandpa's answer is simple, and remains as one of the truest words of wisdom ever spoken in a film. A loser isn't someone who doesn't win but someone who doesn't do anything because he's afraid of losing. And with that idea on mind, we're already confident about little Olive, and only wish that she would have the opportunity to express herself in the pageant, the result doesn't really matter  didn't I mention the similarity with 'Rocky' by the way?But all the inspiring messages of the world would be meaningless if they didn't have great movie moments to immortalize them, and like the iconic finale of the 1976 Best Picture, 'Little Miss Sunshine' ends in an apotheosis, when we finally discover Olive's secret number. The musical climax is the movie's highlight and the best illustration of its positive message. At the end, all the members of this unforgettable Hoover family have corrected some aspects of their life's conception, and so we did.To conclude, whether it's about winning and losing, one thing the movie would surely win is your heart.",10,1,2,30 November 2011
North by Northwest," The tale of an amnesic James Bond ... or put in other words, the consummate Hitchcock's film ...
","For many years, I regarded 'North by Northwest' as a chaotic assemblage of action-thriller vignettes for the sake of an unsubstantial plot, using the casting of an aging Cary Grant as a sorry excuse to grab more fans, definitely not worthy of its reputation. After a second viewing, I concede I didn't have the right mindset to appreciate the hidden brilliance of 'North by Northwest'.Let's start with the plot: Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) is an advertising executive, mistaken for George Kaplan, a secret agent, in reality, only a decoy to distract the villainous mastermind Vandamm (James Mason) from the real agent who happens to be his mistress Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint). Yet for the two thirds of the film, neither Grant nor the viewers are aware of these subtleties. For all we know, Grant is the 'wrong man' whose attempts to prove his innocence worsens his case even more, from driving a car over a cliff after being severely imbibed and pulling a knife out of the back of a UN diplomat who's just dropped in his arms, Thornhill is the constant victim of the most unfortunate circumstances.Alfred Hitchcock directs the film as if understanding the plot was not a priority, he knows the mystery effectively conveys the nightmarish karma of Thornhill, the pawn of a game with unknown rules. For all we know, it's the Cold War and he's torn between two kind of secret agents, the good and the bad ones, Hitchcock doesn't embarrass himself with more details and uses the actors like living props to put in the most extreme and spectacular situations. When Thornhill confronts Vandamm, he pretends not to be 'George Kaplan', to which Vandamm, with Mason's deep and mellowest voice, answers 'Games? Must we?'. Thornhill is victim of the innocent-man syndrome, using the same rhetoric than a guilty one, inevitably preventing Vandamm to say more. Thornhill can't talk because he doesn't know, Vandamm can't because he doesn't believe Thornhill, at the end, it's only Hitch effectively keeping his little secret.But this secrecy is not gratuitous either, it effectively induces the paranoid feeling of the story, tapping on one of fear's most effective forms: the fear of the unknown, reaching its thrilling paroxysm in a scene set in the middle of nowhere. For eight minutes, nothing happens, Thornhill is just waiting, for whom, for what? We don't know, and we wait. The suspense is carried by our own interrogations, until a crop-duster comes, not with the friendliest intentions, contributing to the most defining moment of the film. The nightmare goes on and gets so intense that Thornhill would rather get himself arrested by the police. He doesn't know what he's escaping from, but he knows enough about his enemies. Yet the unknown can also come in the form of a beautiful creature like Eve Kendall (Eva Maria Saint) popping out in the middle of the chase and hiding Thornhill, in her bedroom after a dinner with enough sexual innuendo to make good old Grant lower his guard.But if one can't face the unknown, he can leave it nonetheless. And ironically, Thornhill is given a chance to leave until he's told by one of the 'good' agents, played by Leo G. Carroll, that he endangered Eve's life. Thornhill finally detaches from his passive status by becoming a player and making his own rules. The key is not to 'find the truth', at that point, we know everything, but the point is to stop being Hitch's puppet and finally act like a hero , for a last thrilling confrontation  and to get the girl in the process. No room for subtlety, this is not 'Vertigo' or 'Rear Window', this is pure hormonal Hitchcock. And Cary Grant is never more at ease and charismatic as during the last sequence, accomplishing the only act that could conceal the paranoia he endured for days, he doesn't escape from the enemy, he goes to it, his direction changed and so did Hithcock's.In a nutshell, I would say 'North by Northwest' is like the tale of an amnesic James Bond. And Hithcocks anticipated all the ingredients that would build the secret agent's legend : the henchmen with killing methods as sophisticated and elaborate as they're ineffective, escapist settings, car chases, a suave and distinguished villain, a sensual lady and naturally the ultimate climax in Mt. Rushmore, the very sequence that catalyzed Hitchcock's desire to make the film. Ernest Lehman, who wrote the screenplay, intended to make the 'Hitchcock picture that would end all the Hitchcock pictures.' (and unintentionally pave the way for James Bonds' flicks) 'North by Northwest' reassembles every Hitchcockian ingredient: the blond, the mistaken identity, the villain, the paranoia induced by the enemy's invisibility, the claustrophobia, even Martin Landau as Leonard is not your typical one-dimensional hit-man and has a sort of 'Rope' vibe behind his sensual eyes.And the film magnificently concludes with one of the riskiest and most memorable ellipses of Cinema's history, the transition from Thornill trying to pull Eve from the Mt. Rushmore to the upper bunk of a train was classic enough, the icing on the cake concocted by Hitch himself was the penultimate shot of the train speeding up to the tunnel, whose symbolism needs no explanations. 'North by Northwest' is undoubtedly the consummate Hitchcock movie, even more appreciated when we're familiar with his previous films. For the mark of a great director is to toy with his own trademarks and indulge himself to movies with less substance but never at the expenses of suspense and entertainment, magnificently conveyed by Bernard Herrman's theme and unforgettable opening credits.'North by Northwest' didn't end all Hitchcock pictures but the great streak of the 50's through a triumph of spectacular entertainment, explaining why, one year after, Hitch would turn to a less ambitious format, almost B-movie like, in black-and-white, for an obscure little film called 'Psycho'.",9,3,4,11 June 2013
Hugo," Lacked precisely what it was paying tribute to
","Maybe I got fooled by the ratings and the film's place in IMDb Top 250, but no matter what, I never miss a Scorsese film and I was really eager to discover 'Hugo'.Scorsese is one of the most defining and consistent filmmakers of his generation but he is also one of these privileged filmmakers so adored that no matter what they do, it's always 'gold' for the fans, Quentin Tarantino is another blatant example... Whenever I read a review of a Scorsese film by Roger Ebert, probably his fan number one, it's a sort of admiration that almost confines to fetishism, with always the same stuff written in different formulas. Scorsese as –I paraphrase- 'the tormented genius with the greatest talent to depict sinning hearts in quest for redemption', this is so overused that it deliberately neglects the fact that many filmmakers explored these themes lately even better than him, Abel Ferrara, to name one.Now to 'Hugo', which is not a 'bad movie'; in fact, it's even far from being a bad movie ... but when you read all the ecstatic reviews, they all make it sound as if the non-fans didn't get it was a tribute to Silent films. We all got that it's a film that reminds us of the most glorious days of filmmaking, the Golden Age of creativity, with a bonus from Ebert: it's also the expression of Scorsese's own existential grieves through the portrayal of George Meliès. The problem with these reviews is that they focus on many elements of 'greatness' forgetting that, as I often say, their combination doesn't make a movie necessarily great. When you take 'Hugo' as a whole, I don't know, but you realize that many parts indeed drag too long, that the pacing is slow and not 'Kubrick' slow, it's slow as we're always ahead of the characters, especially the two kids.Indeed, we know that it's only a matter of time since the boy and the girl would get together and try to solve the mystery, so all we have to do is wait for the script to cement their complicity in the most believable way, and when it finally happens, you think 'it was about time', no pun intended. There are some parts where the dialog sounded forced and stereotypical to a degree that even Spielberg wouldn't have dared to reach, the boy who lost her father, the girl whose parents are dead, loneliness, sadness  granted that being an orphan makes a kid more interesting story-wise but why drowning this in an ocean of pathos? The movie overuses depth as the convenient excuse for slow pacing like the epic 'Benjamin Button' bore did, and sometimes, I really waited for something to happen, and it has nothing to do with violence, explosion, 'kiss kiss' or 'bang, bang'  just some action, drama, and I'm not counting the subplot with the buffoonish police officer (Sacha Baron Cohen) and his dog, probably the most embarrassing moments of the film.Anyway, it took time for the plot to take off and it became more interesting when the movie revealed what it wanted to be: a homage to cinema and Silent classics, and I reckon the story of George Meliès was very poignant and Kingsley is extremely convincing as the grumpy old guy. But seriously, what's that ever got to do with the beginning? The movie started like a Family Adventure film and ended as a tribute to an artist who simply needed to know that he wasn't forgotten. I'm sorry but as much as I appreciate the fact that younger audience should know more about Meliès, this is still adult material, the whole existential aspect contradicts the initial tone of the film. The film tries to be so many things, 'Harry Potter' and 'Amelie Poulain' with the slapstick of a Disney film but at the end, it just feels like an assemblage of parallel stories (the policeman with the girl, the automaton, the librarian ) with unequally satisfying conclusions for each of them.Talking of the policeman, the script tries to fill the gaps by adding peripheral characters like him -after all, movies like this need a villain- but the other characters are so one-dimensional and sterile that it made the whole thing look artificial. Take simply the way the extras walk, it's all mechanical, they see a kid running and carrying a weird automaton, and they don't even pay attention, they're just here to recreate a crowd and bump on Hugo or the girl when they're running. The film and its recreation of a 30's Paris is visually dazzling but it had something very lifeless as if the population was made of automatons. And if it wasn't for the beautiful score, some scenes would have been quite dull because the kids' dialogs really felt written, especially Chloe Moretz' line (too mature, even from a girl who loves to read). There's something cruelly lacking in the film, I guess it's simply called entertainment. The film lacked precisely what it was paying a tribute to: this zaniness, flamboyance, creativity of early cinema, it lacked the very spirit of Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd, and even the cheers at the end had some very dark and depressing undertones.There were two movies making tribute to Silent films in 2011, 'The Artist' and 'Hugo', I thought 'The Artist' was great precisely because it managed to tell an endearing romance with the homage aspect as an implicit back-story. Although 'Hugo' has an interesting pedagogic value, there's a feeling of underachievement from the adventure aspect. Spielberg's 'Tintin' didn't have much depth, but I had a better time watching it.I respect Scorsese for exploring other themes and cinematic techniques, but I think the movie is a little bit over-praised and just because Scorsese made it -again- that doesn't prevent from pointing out some weaknesses.",7,2,6,17 January 2012
Doctor Zhivago," Doctor Zhivago and Master Lean... two misunderstood poets...
","There's a scene where Yuri Zhivago (Omar Sharif) examines some organisms from his microscope, the doctor is interested but the poet is in awe of their beauty. That detail mirrors David Lean's own method: he's a man of art who cares less for interest than emotion. Like when a window behind Lara (Julie Christie) exposes a radiant sun. It is less the sun that is the 'small touch' than the way Yuri thinks of Lara whenever he sees sun, flowers or sunflowers. How else can you tell a poet apart from his capability to find in anything -from a window covered with frost to majestic trees near the Urals- the path to heavenly imagery? If anything, the film is about the poet Zhivago and these are as powerful leitmotifs as the iconic 'Lara's theme' by Maurice Jarre, reminding us that nothing can ever prevent the noblest sentiments to bloom, not a cold winter, not even a revolution or a civil war. While 'Doctor Zhivago' has the pretension of an epic, it's as much about war as 'Casablanca', and as romantic, glossy and old-fashioned.And should it be a surprise from the director of 'Brief Encounter'? I saw in 'Doctor Zhivago', the same eagerness to get to the passion but with a special sense of crafted patience. Contrarily to 'Brief Encounter', Lean had the luxury of three hours of running time so he could toy with our expectations by making both Yuri and Lara meet in several occasions to plant the seeds of a romance that wouldn't blow until the two first hours are over. As if there was more power in the anticipation of love than love itself.And strangely enough, for all the talk about the director's talent when it comes to big production and crowded scenes, it's during the intimate moments that the film glows, not only between Yuri and Lara but even in the earlier scenes that set up key characters such as the corrupt aristocratic and pragmatic Kamarovsky (played by the only American cast-member Rod Steiger) or the solemn idealism of Tom Courtenay as Pacha. The former would survive out of a romanticism he never suspected, the latter would lose his heart for the Revolution.In fact, all characters are more or less tragic figures and the movie is like a great canvas where people are forced to make a choice between feelings and duty, sometimes making both converge like Tonya, Yuri's devoted wife (Geraldine Chaplin) but overall, they are all guided by feelings that can't be more individualistic, if not selfish. That might be the antithesis to the spirit of the Revolution that made Boris Pastarnek's novel silenced by official decree. The poet who loved two women and wrote the novel in ten years was forced to decline his Nobel Prize because he loved Russia even more and couldn't accept exile. 
Yet he was the poet, and the intolerance that struck his life is still less intolerable than admitting that the Revolution totally canceled passion in the hearts of Russians, as Zhivago's brother (Alec Guinness) stated 'there's no Russian who doesn't love poetry'. And Yuri finds something in Lara that ignites his poet's soul, something that transcends whatever reality and marital comfort can provide. Hard to judge him, the way Julie Christie looks in the film that doesn't even give half its full meaning to the word beauty: her hair, her lips, her eyes... Yuri's words were certainly far more eloquent than mine... all I could say is that she was breathtakingly beautiful. And breathtaking is a word that applies to Lean's attention to visual details, and the way each of his movies are opportunities for spectacular landscape shots. His imagery allowed then-viewers to escape from their monotony and explore the wilderness, whether in the desert, the Indochinese jungle or the cold Siberian winter where an ice palace becomes the setting of a magnificent romance. And even in the ugliness of a train where people are piled up like cattle for days, Lean proves how great a director he is by precisely not directing Klaus Kinski, letting him be truly the free man he's portraying in the film.Lean's work is so admirable in subtle details that it was obviously diluted into the vastness of the project, earning him severe critics, blaming him for trivializing History. Time did justice to the movie and allowed it to be remembered as one of the last great super-production of its era, one that allowed Omar Sharif, an Arab riding a camel, to become a romantic leading man, playing against part, but what part! Like a poet, he's a rather passive observer, but for all the cast-members I mentioned -including Ralph Richardson as the scene-stealing father-in-lax rumbling about the hooligans who took over power- It is definitely Sharif's film.I closed my review of 'Lawrence of Arabia' by a small ethnic bias saying that I was delighted that one of the best British American films would be about Arabs and now, that one of the highest-grossing movies of all-time, and most prestigious British films, would star an Arab was equally delightful. And I will also conclude by inviting you to look on Youtube the words' Zhivago and Didi, this was a sketch I grew up with that made me aware of that score two decades before I saw the film, I can never hear that theme without thinking of it, sometimes, you find connections in the weirdest places. It's not much poetry, but maybe the other main feeling Lara's theme conveys: nostalgia, the best antidote against cynicism or any excesses of rationality.Sure there are a few things to 'criticize' but I don't think the film intended its audience to venture into intellectual territories... so just let yourself be transported by the story the actors and the old-school Hollywood charm of 'Doctor Zhivago', and its so effective music and you won't be disappointed.",9,0,0,4 October 2018
The Shining," Welcome to 'The Shining''s Overlook Hotel ... such a scary place ... such a scary face ...
","Stanley Kubrick's 'The Shining' is a movie that impresses by its extraordinary ability to scare the hell out of you. You may say that this is the basic premise of a horror film, but believe me, it's not that obvious. When you expect to be scared, you kind of mentally prepare yourself to be shocked at any moment to minimize the impact. In the case of 'The Shining', a movie I've seen multiples times, no matter how long I keep my guard up, the movie gets me every time. And this is all to the credit of Kubrick's perfectionist direction, a gift that includes a very accurate casting instinct : four important characters in the film, all of them perfect.'The Shining' is adapted from Stephen King's novel of the same title, and you can tell that the author has a strange fascination for claustrophobic places, as it seems to provide resourceful elements to thrill you and keep your heart literally hooked, always expecting the worse to invite itself. And that's understandable in a very basic level, if you find yourself in a closed place, you can't escape, this is the basis of 'Alien', 'Das Boot' and many other thrilling masterpieces. But in 'The Shining', although the hostility of the environment is very well suggested by the shots of the long and tortuous road leading to the Hotel, and the cold winter that blocks the way, the horrifying element of the location is still kind of diluted in its vastness. The Overlook Hotel is so big that the places where to hide are countless. So, the plot needs an extra push to increase the Hotel's level of scariness, and though I concede the script is not the movie's strongest asset, it gets us prepared in a relatively good way, giving away the 'terrible secret'. The former family who kept the Hotel during the summer was brutally killed by the father before he shot himself to death. This doesn't seem to distract Jack Torrance, the new inhabitant, played by Jack Nicholson, on the contrary, he finds the anecdote quite amusing.The film doesn't embarrass itself with subtleties. From the start, we kind of expect that Torrance will be victim of the same Syndrome that lead to this bloody murder, his eyes are already telling something, as if Jack Torrance's personality had a parallel predisposition to be victim of the disturbing atmosphere governing the Hotel, and Nicholson's unique talent to embody evilness with one grin and one hell of a hypnotic stare. Torrance's eeriness contrasts with the sweet motherly naivety of Wendy, Shelley Duvall in a performance I consider among the best female leads in a horror film, and the innocence of their little boy, Danny played by the namesake actor, Danny Lloyd. The last thing we precisely learn in the first act, is about Danny's strange ability to telepathically communicate. He's got the shining, a supernatural power he shares with Holloway, played by the late Scatman Crothers. We understand that this shining will play a significant role to the plot, while surprisingly pleased by the return of the unforgettable orderly Turtle from 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' who doesn't open the window this time, but close the last door letting the Torrance family on its own. Now, we have all the parameters, the movie can start.And the least we can say is that we're quickly plunged in one of the creepiest and most uncomfortable atmospheres from a movie, beautifully embodied by Kubrick's direction. The cinematography is efficient, powerful, and not restrained. 'The Shining' looks, sounds and plays like a horror film, Kubrick doesn't transcend but he doesn't cheat either. Take the subliminal appearances of the twin girls, reminiscent of the same hallucinatory images from 'The Exorcist', the iconic torrential waves of blood splashing, the long bicycle ride along a never ending floor, not to mention the famous scene where Wendy finally discovers what Jack was writing all this time, and I can go on, and on, Kubrick's touch is omnipresent in the film, and his nomination to a Razzie is a joke. There's a perfectionist feeling that makes the aesthetic of the hotel, scary in every single surface of it. The bar, the bathroom, the room, everything exudes a kind of hostility, that you wonder how you can spend months and months without getting alienated by such a place, as it happened for Jack.But I don't think 'The Shining' is nuanced enough to invite for an analysis about Jack Torrance's evolution. One could go on about dehumanization, being trapped in a place and letting your evil side influence you, I think the movie just delivers the premise of a great horror film and it works thanks to the characterization of the good guys. Danny is sweet and Wendy so genuine, so loving and caring for Jack, we can't not to root for them, and wish for them to leave this nightmare. Because this is a nightmare, when someone you love is eager to kill you and it's almost impossible to kill, even to hurt him because of self-preservation, while survival instinct commands you to escape but you can't. 'The Shining' is as nightmarishly captivating as Jack is perfect, his face when he opens the door with the ax, is not the scariest moment but surely the most iconic, although for me, fear and panic have never been more perfectly incarnated than by Shelley Duvall's disfigured face while screaming and begging. This was realistic in its touching ugliness and the best pay-off of Kubrick's infamous perfectionism.And the climax is probably the best you can expect from the genre, so full of thrills, and some 'what-the-hell' moments forever graved in my memory  'The Shining''s flaws are simply irrelevant because you know you just watched a great horror film, when your sensation at the end is relief ... like when waking up from a nightmare",9,1,2,29 May 2011
American Beauty," How can you define a movie that defines you ?
","'American Beauty' is a challenging film to review. So challenging I hesitate between two radical attitudes, introspective and philosophical or cynical and detached, but I guess neither would work. One would be like Lester's infamous 'highlight of the day', the other like Lester unbuttoning Angela's blouse with appetite before she reveals it's her first time. In both cases, it's excitement leading to disappointment. So, what's 'American Beauty' exactly telling us?In fact, I don't even think the movie tells 'us' something, but rather tells something different 'for each of us' ... for some people, it's like an 'Existentialism For Dummies' film, for others, it's an inspirational invitation to 'play an active role' in life rather than 'enduring it'. The figure of Kevin Spacey as Lester Burnham, the average looking tertiary employee man, incarnates the pervert effects of suburban life, mostly made of superficiality and illusions of happiness through the sensations of owning stuff, or being someone on the basis that you wears a tie, carry a briefcase and have a job, no matter how useless for the future of humanity, it is. But Lester incarnates this figure with the quality that makes losers so appealing: lucidity. He knows his life is crap. He knows his wife Carolyn (Annette Bening) and his tormented 17-year old daughter Jane (Thora Birch) see him as a loser. And he knows his life has reached rock-bottom, but it's never too late to change. Paraphrasing another existential film of the same year, we meet Lester 'at a very strange time in his life', where in a crucial Howard 'Bealesque' impulse, he decides he can't take it anymore.And the pivotal point couldn't have been creepier. Lester gets infatuated with his daughter's friend, the cute and apparently slutty Angela, and decides to do some muscular exercises, to impress her and ultimately to  sort of  bang her. Well, the beautiful Conrad L. Hall's cinematography depicts Lester's lusty fantasies in such stylish aesthetics you totally forget that it's all about assessing his manhood on a creature so young, she would see the man, not the exploited office worker, the passive husband, or the lousy father. Angela, the delicate and sensual Mena Suvari shows the light to Lester, a road paved with so many rose petals that paint Lester's dreams in a shining red almost foreseeing the film's bloody epilogue. Anyway, from this lust at first sight moment, Lester is another man, abandoning himself to solitary pleasures not in the shower anymore, but in bed with Carolyn, who starts to realize that if she's not the mother of the year, she's not the wife either.Carolyn is a flamboyant real estate agent who loves her job, as much as her little rose garden. She takes care of both with the same perfectionist delicacy and same dreams of accomplishment. She's so blinded by her ambition that she's incapable to realize the failure of her marriage and lives more confidently in the apparent illusion of comfort and success, than the real substantial essence of happiness. But Carolyn is only superficial if you look at her with superficial eyes. Look closer, since this is the movie's tag-line, Carolyn is not ambitious, she's not superficial, she's just naive for God's sake. She's the perfect embodiment of the constant optimistic attitude illustrated by Voltaire's character Candide whose motto -ironically- happened to be : 'We need to cultivate our garden'. And for the disillusioned Jane, the idea of self-improvement can only be reduced to a project of breasts augmentation surgery. Her teenage crisis is aggravated by the absence of strong models. She hates her pervert father, her dull mother, her life. The changes occurring in the Burnham Family will coincide with the arrival of the new neighbors, the Fits, another peculiar and not-so-happy family. The father Frank, Chris Cooper, is a bigot minded homophobic ex-military officer, with a totally lobotomized wife and one unique son, Wes Bentley as the tortured Ricky. Ricky is literally, the 'eye' of the film, as the one who films people with a cam and develops a strange ability to see inner beauty whether it's in Jane, dead birds or plastic bags, yes he's weird. 'Me Ricky, You Jane'. He's not just an eye-opener, he's eye-opening, catalyzing Lester's evolution, leading to one of the most inspiring 'I quit' scenes from a man who's got 'nothing to lose'. But in a pessimistic device, paraphrasing another existential film of the same year, self-improvement ends up looking like masturbation and for Lester, the death it lead to, wasn't the 'little' one. He'll end up killed by Frank Fits after the unfortunate misunderstanding built up all through the film. Ebert said something like: 'Lester Burnham is dead but he's not a loser anymore.' I disagree with this positivist attitude. Death is still the ultimate loss and I'd rather not be a loser, only if I had the chance to be something else.So for realistic people, 'American Beauty' is a pessimistic pamphlet against the American Way of Life. For pessimistic people, it's a depressing introspection into the alienating effect of the bourgeois way of life, for depressed people, it's the unbearable crappyness of life ... so crappy that you rather find beauty in a vulgar plastic bag floating in the wind ... Or maybe 'everything is not what it seems to be', and American Beauty is just a manipulative film trying to convey the dangerous idea that the best way to be freed from social obligations is to do sports, smoke pot, and live like a parasite, or it's simply the best film of the 90's. In other words, either 'American Beauty' is a masterpiece because it's so misunderstood, or it's such a masterpiece that it's misunderstood.That's what I call the 'Fight Club' syndrome.",10,0,2,30 June 2011
Judgment at Nuremberg," Anatomy of a Holocaust
","It took more than a decade for Hollywood to handle the most painful aspect of World War II, the most difficult to watch from a cinematic perspective: the Holocaust. George Stevens made 'The Diary of Anne Frank' and Otto Preminger made 'Exodus'. Stanley Kramer adopts a different angle converging with the streak of courtroom dramas that started in the late 50's: '12 Angry Men', 'Witness for the Prosecution', 'Anatomy of a Muder' or 'Inherit the Wind', actually you have a dozen of classics made between 1957 and 1962, and 'Judgment at a Nuremberg' is one of the high points, dealing with the German perspective, it can be subtitled: 'Anatomy of a Holocaust'.The film asks fundamental questions about the responsibility of German judges and prosecutors who sentenced to jail or sterilization, many civilians, out of obedience to the Third Reich regime. Set at the end of the Nuremberg trials in 1948, the film is a powerful documentary-like drama questioning the roles played by men who were not Nazi officers, who never pulled any trigger or activated any gas chamber, yet there's no doubt that their law-abiding attitude cautioned an evil ideology. And the real challenge is to ask ourselves a similar question: what would have we done, today, if we were to be ruled by a shamefully evil law, or at least, unethical.A look at the context: by the time these trials were conducted, all the Nazi top-management was wiped out but while Germany was turning the page of World War II, some people still had to answer for their crimes. Stanley Kramer deals with the trauma of the war without adopting an inquisitive tone and that's worthy of appreciation, the performance of Maximilian Schell as the lawyer of the four judges is pivotal, because this is a man whose competence is undeniable and inspires tacit admiration and obvious concerns from the prosecutor played by Richard Widmarck. Spencer Tracy as Judge Haywood observes the trial with impassible eyes, and from his rugged Yankee look, you can tell this is a man who's really asking question and wants to be convinced.The film is never as powerful as when you stop watching it from a collective aspect and see it from one individual perspective, one that makes things less black-and-white and more complex than they seem. Modern audiences are a few steps ahead of 'Judgment at Nuremberg' but we can appreciate it as a serious drama full of passionately riveting exchanges especially between Schell and Widmarck who, in their own right, manage to have a point even if they stand for diverging opinions. And within a run-time of three-hour, a few other scenes emerge from the judicial routine. Montgomery Clift's awkwardness culminating with his broken voice confronting the impassible Haywood and asking if his mother was feeble-minded, Schell with the passiveness of a cold-blooded bully putting the final nail on his coffin by telling him that all he got is his word and facts can't speak for him.Schell can be rather destructive and finally loses his temper with frail and plump Judy Garland portraying a former Jew's mistress, but the scene works less than Clift's because it is to melodramatic proportions. It is interesting though that Kramer picked Clift and Garland to play worn-out characters, at a time where their career was already declining, and they were broken souls to some degree, there are many artistic licenses taken by Kramer, his loose handling of 'languages' issue, some flashy zooming, all create a rather bizarre self-conscious aspect. Even Burt Lancaster, as accused judge Emil Janning, chooses a pose that gives him a strange solemnity and makes his character uncomfortably sympathetic, oddly enough, the opposite happens with Marlene Dietrich's character that seemed to exist to give Haywood some German insights from a civilian perspective.It comes down to some banal scenes being brilliant, one in jail where a former Nazi camp worker explains it in the most casual way how gas chambers work. I love the fact that he's talking while he's still chewing as if the subject wasn't serious enough to speak with gravity. His casual tone made the point. And in the shot, you have the face of Werner Klemperer (known for Colonel Klink in 'Hogan's Heroes'), he plays a despicable Nazi judge but his face is devastated, either this is the Nazi realizing the extent of the horror, but you can also see the man who survived Nazism and stopped acting in character. In both cases, it was a brilliant moment.'Judgment at Nuremberg' is a dense movie that questions the extents of responsibility, by confronting the Americans to similar issues, how can they condemn German people while avoiding diplomatic complication at the dawn of Cold War? Schell is also the voice that allows pointing a finger on the complicity of the Allies, the application of eugenic laws, the bombing of Hiroshima and many items of discussion suggesting that Germany doesn't have the monopoly of horror. Still, the film manages to find the powerful ending by mentioning that it's not a matter of logic but of fairness. Schell might be 'right' in the absolute, but there comes a time where you've got to think with your heart. Which takes me back to the opening point about the evilness of law.I remember an interesting quote from 'A Man for All Seasons': 'This country is planted thick with laws, from coast to coast, Man's laws, not God's! And if you cut them down, do you really think you could stand upright in the winds that would blow then? Yes, I'd give the Devil benefit of law, for my own safety's sake!' The accused judges would have used this line as a defense; they did what they did for their own interest, because as legal scholars, they believed in law.But if in the name of Law, you give the Devil the benefit of the law, what if the Devil is the law?",8,1,3,10 March 2017
Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa," After the first false start (or first draft), the story finally takes off...
","In 'Madagascar', a hippo, a zebra, a giraffe and a lion from New York Central Park zoo were lost in an exotic location and the Lion into a big identity crisis. In 'Madagascar 2' pretty much the same happens, only this time, the writers did their homework and provided enough development so the plot and the dozens of worthy subplots could fill in a one-hour-and-half format.So, the more I watched 'Madagascar 2: Escape to Africa', the more the first opus looked like a first draft, the thing you write and then realize it doesn't work and improvement is much needed. Madagascar was a fun place but the jungle was so dense it created a feeling of entrapment with an overdose of greens and browns. The lemurs and the fossa were fun and cool but apart from King Julian, Maurice and that little Gizmo-like creature Mort; they could hardly steal the show, not when you had the penguins anyway. The one thing I particularly loved in the film was the endearing friendship between Alex and his zebra friend Marty, so I was expecting the sequel to develop this aspect a little more.Not only it did, but it also fixed all the problems the first film had. If the very setting of 'Madagascar' couldn't work, the wild territories of the savanna did, which is not surprising since they had already proved to be a great vehicle for stories in a previous Disney movie. And while Gloria the hippo and Melman the giraffe were disposable sidekicks in the first, they were given the full individual development they were overdue by being confronted to their peers and to each other. In the first opus, the animals were straight characters discovering a weird universe, in the second one, they are straight characters meeting other straight ones, and the fun comes from the differences (or resemblances). And the sequel allows us to know more about Alex, who used to be Alakay, son of the local Mufasa: Zuba, voiced by the late Bernie Mac.The film's beginning is familiar material, the cub is taken by hunters while his father tries to rescue him but Alakay ends up in New York City and becomes the main zoo attraction, while his new friends comment his tendency to be a show-off. This move has already proved to work for DreamWorks with 'Shrek 2', in the sequel, we've got to know the back-story of the main characters as it makes the perfect connection with the first while being emotionally promising. And in a way, this could have been the first film, with the same premise, like a false start that is fixed now, I guess the writers said 'gosh, where can't we put them, now? They've already been in Africa, I mean Madagascar is in Africa' And someone must have pointed out that it's not the way people visualize Africa. So how about 'Madagascar' in 'The Lion King' territories? So let's make a second start and take the best from the film, the original quartet, Alex' nemesis: the old lady, King Julian, Maurice and Mort, and who's gonna fly them to Africa? The penguins (remember the first film ended with the boat out of fuel, good continuity). And the plane sequence is much more hilarious than the boat ship where all the animals were locked in a box, the penguins play the pilots and hostesses' part, King Julian is in the first class talking politics while Alex and Marty discuss some triviality. And the 'landing' was of course more spectacular and it made Melmann confess his love to Gloria, and it doesn't even come as shock, there had to be something between them. So, the plane crashes and the penguins estimate the delay to six to nine weeks, and you better believe they get it right. They'll even use the chimps to repair the plane, because they have opposable thumbs (damn Darwin), but they're not superior mammals for nothing and they'll know how to raise their voice for their workers' rights.So our friends discover Africa and when they admire the landscape, Alex has a feeling of déjà vu, probably remembering his childhood but it doesn't take a genius to know that this is a clever nod to Disney, and yeah, 'Dreamworks' make a hilarious come-back to Africa with a story that is as entertaining and appealing; it's got love, fights, dancing, tribes' codes, and great character developments through many plots and subplots. Gloria meets the Alpha Hippo Moto-Moto, Melmann becomes the witch doctor and Marty questions his uniqueness after seeing all the zebra quickly learning his tricks. There's a gag involving their resemblance and they also have the same voice so that even Alex can tell his friend from the others. Everything was an improvement from the first and hell, they even improved the 'identity crisis'.After an emotional reunion with his parents, Alex must face the fact that he can't make his tribe proud because he only knows how to dance, disappointing his father and causing him to abdicate because he doesn't have the heart to banish his son, so Makunga (a slicker Scar voiced by Alec Baldwin, but in reality a self-centered loser) becomes the king. But the real troubles start when the waterhole dries up, and maybe this is the time for Alex to prove his value, his own way. It's not the 'remember who you are' but the 'stay true to yourself' (I just love the way he keeps the hat of shame all the time) as if there was really a little gay subtext with the references to dance as an opposition to fight.Watching 'Madagascar 2', I thought of what I said about the first, it's like a long exposition and I can't wait to see the sequel. So, I saw it and I absolutely loved it.",8,3,4,25 August 2016
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," 'Terminator 2' is to 'The Terminator' what T-1000 is to T-800 ...
","My generation still remembers the impact of James Cameron's 'Terminator 2', it was the new touchstone in special effects, with CGI effects that still holds up very well today while 'Jurassic Park' dinosaurs make Bruce the Shark look like something from National Geographic. I challenge everybody to spot anything fake in the way T-1000 parts liquefy or turn to a blade. It looks so real and it'd better do, because otherwise, the film wouldn't work.'The Terminator' had good but no revolutionary special effects, the story and the action wowed audiences. In 'Terminator 2', one of a few sequels recognized as better than the original, the story, the action AND the special effects impressed everyone. And that simple statement deserves a second reading, it means that the movie didn't rely on special effects only, it didn't take them for granted, they had to support the story, they had to have a point. Well, they had the better point they could ever have, underlining the villain's dangerousness and invincibility. A great Sci-fi movie must be spectacular, a great thriller must have a terrific villain to allow the heroes to shine. 'T2' had both and the villain was so constantly spectacular it made the chases look rather conventional, which is saying a lot. Not just thrilling and invincible, but like Michael Biehn in the first film, Robert Patrick is the 'unknown-yet-reassuring face', even more dangerous with a cop uniform.T-1000 is not a replica of the former Terminator model, he's more sophisticated, he can take a human form after touching it, and he can turn his arms or other parts of his robotic anatomy into blunt instruments. What does that mean ? That you can burn him, freeze him and blow him to pieces, his molecular structure will slowly reassemble and, paraphrasing Arnie, 'he'll be back' to hunt you. He's programed to kill John Connor, which means that he's determined and you better not cross his path, in the better case, he'll tell you to get out from such a thing as a driving truck or a flying chopper, in the worst, he'll kill you, either with a bullet but more likely in a way you won't have to see coming. The film features countless 'ouch' moments, which are another mark of the film's greatness, its capability not to swim in the same waters than the predecessor by still recycling the same story. 'Terminator 2' is to 'The Terminator' what T-1000 is to T-800, same program, different technology.The similar program is the requirement of the story. Good old Skynet victim of its own success caused robots to rebel against humans, but they were defeated by John Connor. They tried to kill his mother, and ironically, allowed his very existence, how about then killing the son directly ? When you think about it, this is an endless loop, if the mission fails again and John Connor at 13 isn't killed, they can try him at 7. As a matter of fact, they could've sent a T-1000 in 1984 right again, but the film handles this issue very cleverly. The good Terminator, T-800, played by Arnold Schwarzenegger, will not only be to protect John (Edward Furlong) and eventually kill T-1000 (that's the only way to protect John on the longer term anyway) but also prevent the whole Skynet project from ever existing. 'T2' was supposed to be the one that closed the series, I wish it could have remained that way.So what do we have ? A great villain, a denser and richer story although based on a similar plot, and a great hero. This is another aspect where the film outsmarted its predecessor, the re-casting, so to speak, of Arnold Schwarzenegger in the same role but on the other side of the coin, a robot programmed as a bodyguard, but whose contact with John Connor will teach him a few things about humanity. To have a character like John Connor gives another dimension to the story, while the first was sliding down to a touching romance, Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton had that romantic thing about them, but this time, Sarah Connor changed, she's the bad-ass heroin we left in 1984, too concerned by the future to care for romance, let's make a sort of friendship story.And Arnie strikes again with a tailor-made role for him, playing the same role but you can tell it's not the same character than in 1984. In fact, you could make a film with the two characters fighting each other without having the feeling it's the same actor. Fittingly, both would be listed in the American Film Institute's Top 50 Heroes and Villains, and I believe T-1000 would have deserved a spot in the villains' list. Arnold, like all the other actors, delivers one of his finest performance, served by unforgettable catchphrases. As if « I'll be back » wasn't catchy enough, 'T2' had « No Problemo » and the iconic and immortal « Hasta la vista, Baby ! » The 90's feel so far away when I remember the impact the film had, not just the Sci-fi stuff, or the duel between Arnold and that killer robot trying to get John, there were the relationships, the story, the characters.'Terminator 2 : Judgement Day' isn't a continuation, it's an improvement of a material that was already great in the first place. The good characters are still there, the new ones are more impressive, the special effects (sweeping all the major Oscar categories) were top notch, and the Pop Culture thing isn't to prove now. The film made it #5 in the American Film Institute's Top 10 Sci-fi movies, an all natural choice because the film is a school case of sequel-making. James Cameron mastering his own directorial talent had already proved it with 'Aliens' : a great sequel must remind of the great stuff that was in the original while being a great movie on its own.",10,2,5,24 July 2015
Duck Soup," Waiter! There's a Firefly in my 'Soup' ...
","Simply quacked, 'Duck Soup' is the BEST Marx Brothers film. I could have said 'quintessential' and 'exemplary' or 'most classic' and 'most defining', but sophisticated epithets are so tremendously ostentatious and since I consider superlatives as the worst reviewing tricks ever, the word that still best describes my feeling is 'best', and by 'best', I mean 'funniest'. And my case I rest.Now, is there a recipe that justifies the ecstatic comments put in this 'Duck Soup'? What are the ingredients, the cinematic gourmets might ask? Well, I guess it's just so irresistibly funny that it stands on its own regardless of its status as a 'Marx Brothers' film. The film is purely, objectively and outrageously funny, with as only reason-to-be: fun, fun and fun again. I don't think it's possible to be that hilarious with the plain intention of being funny; the movie works because there is a mood of sheer anarchy that inhabits all the protagonists, a sort of desire to destruct and deconstruct that creates all the comedic force of the film. The Marx Brothers are the 'Schumpeters' of comedy.Not that it bothers me, but I'm not sure I am being clear while writing these lines, but this is probably because I was already questioning the relevancy of a review for a movie like 'Duck Soup', before writing it. Think of it, if you have seen the film, you know it's the funniest of the 'Marx Brothers', and by 'funniest', I mean 'best' but that's the problem: if it's the first time you plan to watch one of their films, starting with 'Duck Soup' condemns you for many disappointments. Not that the others films are bad, some of them are great even by today's standards, but none of them can beat 'Duck Soup' on a zygomatic scale, for one simple reason: 'Duck Soup' is funny from beginning to end. The Marx Brothers are the 'Stakhanovs' of comedy.I guess the fans will understand where I'm coming from: 'Duck Soup' is the only film that doesn't feature the classic sappy romantic subplot, or a musical interlude. Both 'Duck Soup' and 'A Night at the Opera' made the American Film Institute's Top 100 but on the comedy department, 'Duck Soup' is far superior because it doesn't waste its time: every frame, every scene and sequence exists only for pure comedic purposes, with a vis comica that could have defeated Attila's men if it was converted to a military force. 'Duck Soup' is certified 100% pure Marx Brothers, and works like 100 push-ups. The Marx Brothers are the 'Schwarzeneggers' of comedy.'Where is your husband?' 'Why, he's dead.' 'I bet he's just using that as an excuse.' 'I was with him to the very end.' 'No wonder he passed away.' 'I held him in my arms and kissed him.' 'Oh, I see, then it was murder. Will you marry me? Did he leave you any money? Answer the second question first.' This rapid-fire exchange between Groucho Marx as the newly chosen dictator of Freedonia Rufus T. Firefly and Mrs. Teasdale, Margaret Dumont as the irreplaceable dignified matron doesn't exceed fifteen seconds, which makes one joke every four seconds, yet it's so fast-paced that just when you laugh at something another one comes at you, and your mind is so challenged it's impossible to focus on the movie's brilliance.Take Margaret Dumont, who plays with a remarkable professionalism the straight-man role, legend had it that she never got the jokes. Well, Groucho's delivery is so quick that she's forgivable, and his humor so subtle that even I is still scratching my head to the obscure 'Gentlemen, you're fighting for this woman's honor, which is more than she ever did' joke, although I'm not sure I got it, I get why it is funny, and I think this is the key to understand the genius of Dumont's performance. She might not get some jokes, but she got the fact that she's being verbally assaulted and that she contributes to the shining Groucho's talent. While 'MASH' was clearly mean-spirited, 'Duck Soup' provides an elegant way of making fun of someone which almost sounds as flirting when you consider the great chemistry between Groucho, the heavy-weight champion of comedy and Dumont, his priceless sparring-partner.But let's not forget Harpo and Chico, all of them at the top of their game, Zeppo is still not the most memorable character of the bunch, even dethroned by the villainous Trentino (Louis Calernh), the movie provides every possible type of humor, from slapstick to idiotic idiomatic puns, from verbal jokes to pure parody, the film is like a laboratory of joviality, where the four brothers are left with enough freedom to let their creativity explode to the face of the Earth: playing xylophones on soldier's helmets, providing unforgettable musical numbers, from the poor street vendor victim of the hat-changing routine to another running, or let's say, driving gag, one gag follows another, punctuated by totally random (but still hilarious) moments like when Harpo sleeps with his horse, when a dog emerges from his tattoo. There are no limits for absurdity and twice during the film, it culminated with cinematic genius. The Marx Brothers are the 'Einsteisn' of comedy.The first is the mirror scene, probably the 'insert an ecstatic superlative' Marx Brothers moment. When Chico, disguised as Groucho, puts the right hat (while he was seen with another) you could see in their eyes, the innocent joy of two brothers simply having fun. The second is the mayhem 'archive footage' sequence showing the 'coming help', a moment still hilarious after almost eight decades. 'Duck Soup' is so modern it can be considered as a landmark in the field of comedy just like 'King Kong' was a masterpiece from the same year was for visual effects.And don't let yourself be fooled by the film, it might look and sound idiotically funny on the surface, but it really is.",10,1,2,3 January 2012
Apocalypse Now," A hellish cruise for a nihilistic crusade ...
","Attempting to analyze a movie like 'Apocalypse Now' is as futile and dangerous as naively asking: why do people kill each other? Any answer would fatally disappoint. So the most honest approach is to admit that some things are morally wrong and some others are obligatory, and when the two unite, then I guess, you have an idea of what hell is about  hell, as the most eloquent and representative synonym of war.The genius of Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece is to depict war in a cinematically powerful form, which is, let's face it, one of the most exhilarating and psychologically gripping experiences ever. To watch 'Apocalypse Now' is to feel the essence of war, to hear its heart-breaking cry and to witness its devastating damages  the film makes you think less than feel, the film transcends any abstraction. War is a state of mind, yes, but war is made of fights, guts splattered, instant deaths, cries, shouts, explosions of napalm and insanity, genuine breakdowns and orgasmic thrills  everything is real, yet, with a depth never reached by another War film, before or after. There will never be another 'Apocalypse Now'.The film challenges your perceptions with an incredibly haunting cinematography, taking you in a road whose end is uncertain  but uncertainty is like the uncomfortable pillow while patriotism acts as sleeping pills. In more comprehensible words, the value of life is so questionable in wartime that the very idea of winning and losing is useless. Are we humans or are we tools? Why the war? If 'Apocalypse Now' answered these questions, the script would have lost my respect. But instead of telling us why the war exists, Coppola shows what war is. It doesn't even make it more rational, or more understandable, but the film is not about answering questions; it's about making us question ourselves.And we question ourselves. In the boots of Captain Willard, a man whose strange top secret mission will plunge him into the depth of the insanity governing a War. But 'Apocalypse Now' is not a descent into madness; it's a thought-provoking script inviting us to a journey introspecting the very meaning of War as a conflict that tortures our minds. War starts inside us. And the first victim of a war is not the man we'll kill, it's our spirit that we destroy forever, this part of us, for which, human value had a meaning. And forever means forever  we banish ourselves from human community as soon as we participate to war. It's a duty condemning us for eternal alienation, for a purgatory, whose symbolic incarnation is the Colonel Kurtz's tribe, the objective of Willard's mission.Kurtz, created a universe where War has been pushed to its more extreme expression. He reached his breaking point and literally went insane, alienated by a desire to grave War in golden letters, to give a meaning to his military duty. And Coppola's approach is a stroke of genius, because it leaves us perplexed, torn between fascination and disgust, and our guilt to lean towards the former one. The movie doesn't try to inspire our disgust; it respects our intelligence enough not to be judgmental. On the contrary, we respect these men fallen in the trap of an inevitable insanity. They may be assassins, soldiers; they're still men as long as they tried to follow a path made of an idea of what is duty. Yes, they're morally wrong, but in wartime, the only right is to win. Fighting is obligatory. The rest is bullshit.And this is why 'Apocalypse Now' is the movie that best defines war. Because this bullshit, whatever it is, is made of the most precious things you have in your life. And you, soon, get the feeling, that the movie invites you to discover a universe where your only choice is to die or to survive by becoming more ruthless and cold-blooded than your enemy. Kurtz knew that. Willard will know that. And we learn that. 'Apocalypse Now' is not about war, it IS War in the most horrific and realistic view. It's real, it's made of feeling, not ideas, the only ones who express ideas in the film (I'm talking of the Redux version) are those who don't fight. Fighters don't think, they cry, they shout, they object, but ultimately, they kill or are killed, there are no alternatives, and when you kill, it's not to be killed. It's about learning to kill; it's about exploring the most efficient ways to terminate the enemy, about desensitizing ourselves to feel the power not to fear war, but to spouse it in a bloody nuptial nightmare. Desensitizing, indeed, no passion in War, no excitement, no entertainment, no enjoyment, whoever enjoys war condemns himself for death or failure. This is why the first segment of Willard's twisted odyssey is to enlighten us about the inevitability of the American defeat, and the exhilaration driven by the iconic Ride of the Valkyries' helicopter scene, by Colonel Kilgore's charisma, by the bunnies' sexy dancing, or the psychedelic effects of the 'Satisfaction' scene, with the water skiing, are just misleading. The road is on the river, the boat is the only referential, but the closer they'll get to Kurtz, the more palpable will be the effects of war. And to get Kurtz is to become Kurtz, and to understand Kurtz is to understand war. To understand war, is to understand hell.Francis Ford Coppola is a genius, because he offered to Cinema a unique creation, defining Cinema as an Art, as something meaningful, with a strange capability to make us feel something we didn't experience, like the emptiness of a hellish War where the only way of survival is killing, and passionless killing though. No room for feelings, this is the Apocalypse. And the way the movie opens, speaks loudly the horrific message to humanity  This is the end.",10,0,1,14 April 2011
The Battle of Algiers," A Historical Masterpiece of Documentary-style Realism ...
","Some movies affect your heart in their depiction of the darkest sides of human nature. Some others challenge your perception of what is right or wrong. And some movies penetrate your senses, elevating the cinematic enjoyment to an extraordinary level. 'The Battle of Algiers', Gillo Pontecorvo's masterpiece of documentary-style realism, combines these three elements, turning a war movie with unknown actors and minimal dialogs into a unique cinematic experience.'The Battle of Algiers' is a fictional documentary about one of the most controversial periods of French history, during the decolonization era, when Algeria was a 130-year-old department of the French territory. But, as powerfully illustrated in the first frames, there was the city and there was the casbah. The film opens with a powerful symbol, the dorsal spine of its narrative, the cultural gap: a key element in our understanding of the roots of terrorism in one side and torture in another one, our hearts freed from any bias.Pontecorvo conveys his message by injecting an implacable logic in the script. When the 'hero' Ali La Pointe, a brave hot-headed fighter, joins the NLF, his first mission is to shoot a French policeman with an empty gun. Later, Jafar, his mentor explains that it was the only way to prove he wasn't a spy; French could have sacrificed an Algerian to infiltrate a spy but not one of them. The same faultless logic is illustrated by the other main character, Colonel Mathieu, whose impeccable speech delivery and sunglasses are one of the most iconic elements of the film. Mathieu teaches us (through his soldiers) how the guerrilla's triangular structure means that each member knows only three persons, his leader and his two subordinates. 'To know them means to eliminate them', which implies the tactical use of police methods even if it flirts sometimes with illegality. But since the prisoners must maintain silence for one day to let time to the organization 'to render any information useless', we understand that one can't make omelet without breaking a few eggs.The same logic applies to terrorism: in the movie's most chilling part, we realize the efficiency of the NLF methods in a masterstroke of editing. We follow three women not visibly accustomed to wear occidental clothes or to cut their long hair, a precious symbol of beauty for Arabic women. They dutifully make themselves look pretty and occidental enough to fool the French guards who don't even search them. Each one leaves a bomb hidden in her basket in a public place. Besides the editing which creates one of the greatest cinematic montages, the directing prevents the film from any desensitizing effect of violence. Pontecorvo shows us the faces of the soon-to-be victims, laughing, chatting, a kid licking an ice-cream and young people dancing, fresh and smiling faces making ours particularly uneasy. Even the woman who planted the bomb avoids looking straight before leaving not to let an ounce of guilt weighing her heart down. But I was devoured by the guilt of being 'part of' the operation, when the first explosion occurred in a devastating realism and the boys and girls went out of the dance-club, I just wanted to shout them not to go back inside  The bombing sequence is the part of the film that definitely contradicts any accusation of bias. But to keep the vital dosage of impartiality, the interview of the NLF member Ben H'midi indirectly explained (not justified) the use of terrorism with an ironic 'Give us your bombers, and you can have our baskets' 'The Battle of Algiers' shows the origins of acts we label as cruel with never putting them into perspective. When the only rule is to win, the ends justify the means: 'Should we remain in Algeria? If you answer 'yes,' then you must accept all the necessary consequences.' says Mathieu. Even the civilians are killed by the NLF, through terrorism or heartless drive-by shootings. But the film doesn't exalt these acts nor does it dehumanize the authors: Mathieu respects Ben H'midi's patriotism and even Jafar admits it'll take more than terrorism to mobilize the population. Still, it's no surprise the film has been screened in the Pentagon during the Iraq War or Israel during the Intifada. This highlights the power of movies, to understand urban guerrilla is almost impossible without watching 'The Battle of Algiers'. But as documentary as it is, it's still a film, in the good sense of the word.I don't think the movie is as dispassionate as it's often described, the last discussion with Mathieu reminds the old adage, winning the battle, but not necessarily the war. It was a tactical not strategic victory. And yes, for some reason, the war started again, concluding the film with one of its most spectacular scenes, featuring so realistic riots, I still wonder how Pontecorvo recreated this. The climactic conclusion will haunt me forever through this scene where the policeman asks the population 'What do you want?' and then, behind the mist, you hear people's shouts punctuated with Algerian women's strident yodels  they shout and dance, waving the new Algerian banner in one my most thrilling cinematic moments, even more relevant when you think of the current events in Egypt, Tunisia and other Arab countries, the shouts of despair and chants of hopes, from overly passionate populations who know the value of freedom enough to fight for it.This in an exhilarating movie which, more personally, made me shudder so many times I thought I left my window open. But then I realized this sensation in my shoulders was the weight of affiliation, to a culture that seems to get things the hard way, a hot blooded culture that inhabits the eyes of my Algerian grand-mother who lived that time ... a sensibility that I inherited, making me react to the beautiful closing theme with deep emotions and hopes for a better future",10,0,1,14 February 2011
The Patriot," Following 'Braveheart' to the 'Indepedence Day' ...
","When the director of 'Independence Day', the screenwriter of 'Saving Private Ryan' and the hero of 'Braveheart' work together, a result like 'The Patriot' isn't surprising. The summer 2000' blockbuster is a flamboyant, heavily patriotic epic relating the war between the Continental Army and the Loyalists to the British Crown, and the British Redcoats. The central figure of this American Revolution is Benjamin Martin, who couldn't have had a better incarnation than Mel Gibson, the eternal hero of 'David vs. Goliath' causes.There' such sincere poignancy in Gibson's performance that he carries the whole film with the same confidence and pride as if it was the stripes and stars banner. In fact, the same film without him would have lost half of its effect; the role was tailor-made for Mel Gibson. And 'The Patriot' has the perfect mix of action (the battles are as gruesome and realistic like 'Braveheart') and emotion. I even wonder why the film didn't get as many accolades as 'Braveheart' or its rival of the same year 'Gladiator', both have their share of thrills, Gibson had nothing to envy on Russel Crowe, much more his archenemy, played by Jason Isaacs, is probably the only villain to match Joaquin Phoneix on the field of awfulness.Action and sentimentality indeed, the film was both spectacular and surprisingly moving. It's like 'The Patriot' tried to embody the two pillars of patriotism, muscle and heart: we fight for the country, but there's no fight without a heart to drive the spirit. We got the message on 'Saving Private Ryan' but Mel Gibson's presence is here to remind us that the film borrows more from 'Braveheart' than Spielberg's WWII epic. The comparison with 'Braveheart' is even more inevitable because the enemy is the same, only this time, they're not incarnated by their king, but by one colonel, who's not less ruthless and cruel, but you can tell, they wanted to avoid attacks on historical accuracy, by showing that not all the English acted that way.But Emmerich isn't a man of restriction and wisely enough, wouldn't trade thrills for objectivity, and Lord knows a movie like 'The Patriot' couldn't have afforded objectivity. The more hateful the antagonist is, the more you support the hero, and even if he fights for a just cause, it's for the hero we care. We cared for Scots because it was William Wallace's people, not because we were eager to support them, the same goes for Americans. Granted they're the good guys in the film, but it's their personification by Gibson that creates our empathy, and it works precisely because he is unenthusiastic about the Revolution. This reluctance echoes the same plot of 'Braveheart' when Wallaces states he doesn't believe in violence, but making violence undesirable doesn't prevent it from happening. You know the rule, there are two ways to die in Mel Gibson's films, to be family or wife (he played widowers in more than 15 films, including the 'Lethal Weapon' and 'Mad Max' series) or kill his family or wife. That's the trigger to awaken the fierce beast and reopen the concealed wound. Benjamin Martin, the ex-veteran of the French and Indian war, coerced by his comrade and friend Chris Cooper to vote for the levy to support the Continental War, refuses first because he's got seven children and 'can't afford principles'. It doesn't take much for a movie fan to guess what kind of action will definitely make any English soldier an enemy for a man who adores his children more than anything. It even subtly questions the roots of a patriotism which is less made of abstractions, but as a sort of society's collective dream starting on its core: family.But that's it, with Mel Gibson, no matter how predictable a plot point is, the acting wins our hearts, and it's impossible to resist to his on-screen charisma. What follows the turning point is a magnificent display of bestial savagery, but just because we root for the father as we despise the villain, just because Colonel Tavington (Isaacs) killed his son and ordered the soldiers to shoot the wounded Continentals, we savor the first vengeance. Watching the 'tomahawk ambush' isn't a sadistic delight, but the emotionally satisfying pay-off of a patient build-up and the sign of even more thrilling sequences to come. And still, 'The Patriot', and that's why I enjoyed it more than 'Gladiator', doesn't overplay the 'serious' card, this is not just an action film, there are characters, there is a spirit, and even some with guiding the action.Indeed, there are many cute and moving moments that would have felt awkward in other typical action films, a sweet romance between Benjamin's idealistic son Gabriel, played by a young Heath Ledger and a sweet courageous girl whose father's deafness creates some funny moments. There is a subplot involving two stolen dogs, Martin's cute little girl who never spoke since the death of Martin's wife and who's responsible for a particularly moving scene (again, we know she will speak but it doesn't make her shining moment any less powerful). There is also the solid supporting presence of Ledger, Cooper and Tcheky Karyo as the grouchy but reliable French (holding some grieves against the British). 'The Patriot' reveals Emmerich's capability to see beyond the limits of its patriotic plot.Inevitably, the criticism it faced concerned Robert Rodat's screenplay and the portrayal of British soldiers, betraying the same superficiality I denounced in 'Saving Private Ryan', but while it ruined Spielberg's film, because it was supposed to be realistic, it remarkably fits with 'The Patriot' because the film doesn't have the same pretension, and easily avoid the 'propaganda' trap. Yes, the Colonel (again, it's not the whole British Army, but one individual) has a Nazi-like morbid aura, but what kind of other villains would match Mel Gibson? It's easy to find critical points in 'The Patriot' but for each one, the alternative is rarely better.",8,2,6,15 August 2013
Silver Linings Playbook," A Director Under the Influence...
","'Silver Lining Playbook' got Oscar nominations in the four acting categories for the first time after three decades, succeeding Warren Beatty's 'Reds', Hal Ashby's 'Coming Home' and Sidney Lumet's 'Network'. As far as acting goes, this is nowhere near what these movies showcased, but I won't make a commentary on the acting, let's just check the film's summary. Just read it again and get back to this review.I'll tag this review with the 'spoiler' mention anyway, but seriously, isn't the spoiler obvious from the start? If there's anything Woody Allen and romantic comedies have taught us, it is that anyone with an ex-wife will end up meeting a stranger hell, this is already given away in the summary. If we don't get that Patrick (Bradley Cooper) and Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) will be together, we haven't seen enough movies in our lives. That said, I have nothing against predictability as long as it is satisfyingly conducted and occasionally creates a few original situations. I found none in 'Silver Lining Playbook', not that I didn't enjoy it to some degree, but the 'masterpiece' labeling and awards' nods sort of heightened my expectations.I guess the mental troubles of many protagonists and the way it raised 'awareness' about the obsessions that can damage people's lives, (such as anger problems, compulsive habits, gambling, sexual infidelities etc.) are so many positive elements that speak in favor of David O' Russell. But why are critics pretending that he 'pioneered' something as if 'Ordinary People', the heartbreaking chronicles about a family stricken by grief and trauma or a masterpiece like John Cassavetes 'A Woman Under the Influence', never existed. That movie alone should put to shame any attempts of comparison. That Lawrence won an Oscar and not Rowlands is perhaps more maddening than any situation in 'Playbook'. Lawrence was good, but a few emotional outbursts don't equate the realistic embodiment of craziness, and neither does saying that you love sex with that 'sultry mysteriousness' and shadowy eyes.There is a sort of half-serious half-awkward vibes the directing constantly tries to exude and while it doesn't fail to provide some emotional depth, it just rings false during these moments meant to be crucial. Take the Halloween date: the writing is so cringe worthy it is painful. First of all, all through the film, Pat insists about a reconciliation with Nikki, 'Nikki this, Nikki that...', so it is plain obvious that he won't be cured as long as he's obsessed with Nikki. It works to the point of annoying insistence, thrown at our face like the indicator that he's not cured yet. And while there's obvious chemistry with Tiffany, the date is ruined for the stupidest reason: he believes she's crazier than he is on the basis of the sexual experiences she revealed. I couldn't believe he would believe it. Her reaction was naturally anger but fake as it was induced by a fake situation.And don't get me started on the ending, Pat finally got over Nikki and needed to tell her so, but couldn't have he avoided giving Tifanny the wrong impression? No, because we needed the obligatory romantic chase on the sidewalk. Best Picture contender? Gimme a break!Or I must have a problem with O' Russell but while I can see the well-meaning intent behind each of his movies, they always leave me cold. I would moderate this feeling with 'Silver Lining Playbook' because here and there, there were some moments where my empathy rose toward some characters, and that includes Jennifer Lawrence and Jacki Weaver, who played the mother, but most of the time, I was wondering why this movie is elevated on a pedestal of 'eye-opening masterpiece about mental disorders affecting a suburban family', while in the best case, it's got the appeal of made-for-TV afternoon dramas, only with a star-studded cast. De Niro is one of my favorite actors, but even an A-lister like him can't redeem the directing, all through the first act, I was wondering why David O' Russell was over-stuffing his scenes with hand-held camera moments. Sure, it is to accentuate the whole confusion and mental chaos but I could only feel noise and dizziness. There was no build-up to make even this confusion emotionally affecting. It comes at such early points of the film that you don't even know who's crazy or who's not, so the emotional mess is an effect rather than a plot-driver. The second altercation between Cooper and De Niro works better, because we know them and their back-stories, well enough to share their pain. But these moments of strong emotional resonance aren't enough to compensate for the relative emptiness and predictability of the story and the preposterous plot points such a random bet supposed to solve all the family problems and a dance contest that was obviously injected to provide some visual escapism for the film's climax. Otherwise, there was nothing that felt genuinely and powerfully realistic in that film. Awkward doesn't equal realistic except when it's handled by a director who doesn't try to imitate other directors. Whenever I see O' Russell, I got vibes from his 'masters' and after Scorsese in 'American Hustle', here it is Cassavetes, but speaking of him, just go watch Rowlands' performance in 'A Woman Under the Influence' and tell me that 'Playbook' is as powerful. De Niro's crying was effective but it didn't break my heart as Donald Sutherland did in the climactic confrontation or the last ten seconds of 'Ordinary People' and he didn't even get an Oscar nod for that.Sorry for all thel titles' dropping, but if I can use this review to give publicity to real masterpieces that powerfully dealt with family trauma and troubles; it will all be worth it.",6,0,2,10 January 2017
The White Ribbon," Critique of Impure Reasons...
","Michael Haneke 'White Ribbon', Golden Palm winner of Cannes Festival in 2009, takes place in a small German village one year before World War I. The mention of the war sounds like the kind of elements that foreshadows some role the major conflict would play, but if it's any spoiler, I'll say that war has nothing to do with the story and if you expect the kind of movie to provide hints or signals, you'll be disappointed... first and mesmerized after. This is an extraordinary journey in an atmosphere of nauseating and sickening suspicion without any resolution whatsoever.And the warning is necessary because if there's ever a genre to classify the film, it is Mystery. The word should even be used in the plural form as it features many incidents that punctuate the daily routine of the village, from a prank leading to a fall from horse, to a fire, from cabbage decapitation to child molestations, it is bizarre that all these deeds are strung together but that's because the movie brilliantly reflects the fullest range of human malevolence and that we never know who's committed each act is more disturbing than the acts themselves. Haneke fears violence like the next decent man but he fears it so much, he feels the need to anticipate it, to expose its in frontal nudity to better conceal its reversely sacred status, he's not a glorifier of human violence but an iconoclast. Whereas Hollywood is often timid when it comes to display real-life violence, using over-the-top depictions to better make up for their falseness, Haneke dares to show a dead body being toileted or the bloody face of a child who's just been molested, with macabre details revealed. It is ugly but it does justice to the moral fight against violence to show 'the enemy'.Violence isn't just physical, it is also verbal and sometimes with more devastating effects. There's a scene where a doctor confronts his nurse and what comes from his mouth is a flood of verbal bullying that would lure any fragile soul into suicidal candidacy. The man who speaks is the one who fell from the horse in the opening scene, when the animal's legs were stopped by an invisible cable tied between two trees. He's the first victim, but he' as capable as being pitilessly cruel as the monster who pranked him.The film is shot in black and white, but this is not just an artistic license, the early century was old enough to be captured in monochrome, whether cold photographs or silent archives and recent enough not to be depicted in bright painterly colors, it was indeed a time in black and white. But that look precisely invites us to focus on greyish parts, the shadows, what lies behind the curtains of respectability or that dusts off the ashes of evil. Because this is what the white ribbon symbolizes, not the so-called purity but the pretension to achieve it.The film circles around the lives of many villagers, from various ranks and backgrounds at a time where people were mostly defined by their jobs, a baron, a priest, a farmer, the doctor, the teacher, and every one of them tries to maintain a façade of dignity. In an intense scene, a priest delivers a long monologue to his elder children after they've come late home... this is a clear reflection of the kind of puritan mentalities that forged some artistic geniuses like Ingmar Bergman, the use of repression or symbols to conceal the demons. But Haneke is as explicit when it comes to show how laborious these rituals are as to demonstrate their uselessness.This is a village where moral and social conveniences end up poisoning relationships, aa farmer's wife dies because of a work accident but the husband can't complain because he knows it's a lost cause, the baron is the employer and you can't cut the hand that feeds you. A young optimistic teacher tries to seduce the baron's nurse but fails to convince her father to marry him, the priest's son prays God for killing him because he did something wrong, what he did we never know. Still, enumerating all the episodes would be futile and meaningless compared to the main experience.The real achievement is to create a journey where we can sense the presence of two forces, evil and guilt, but with cloud of uncertainty making impossible to associate them with the perpetrators, only the victims, and even then, there's a crucial point Haneke makes is that victimhood doesn't make you an innocent person. In the context of today, where there's a clear gap between victims and predators, you'd have serious troubles if you even dare to say that, but this is why German cinema is so cold and detached, it respects our intelligence enough not to take side, or flatter our moral conscience, it invites us to reconsider our certitudes. 'The White Ribbon' isn't an intellectual exercise, it's a film about people, men, women and children, caught in a sort of hellish spiral they don't know about. Trying to associate this pattern of violence with the rise of Nazism would be too tempting and reducing, because evil has no boundaries, we all carry it, we all have reasons to fear it as much as to commit it. What Haneke does is depicting violence to deprive it from any kind of taboo value, and by refusing to provide hints or answers, he makes both everyone guilty and everyone innocent, and you've got to figure out which option is the worst.We all have our 'white ribbons' our limits, and in the absolute no one would over cause harm to anyone, but these things happen, and just because they are irrational doesn't make them immune to a form of rationality, this is the country of Kant that established that for each cause there's an effect and inversely, and one effect becoming a cause, and maybe that's the perpetual movement of history captured in this microcosm of humanity",9,5,15,25 January 2018
Rocky IV," An 80's Cult Classic ... suffering from a predictable build-up ...
","Is four a lucky number when it comes to the most successful sports franchise of all-time? Well, regarding the box-office score, yes, the fourth opus of the 'Rocky' series is the highest grossing and this is a fact. If it is the best is another matter. While this honor goes either to the opening or the concluding film in my opinion, it's not the worst either, and it carries a little charm getting more palpable after each viewing, granted you know you're not watching a film on the same caliber as 'Rocky', THE masterpiece.I think the 'charm' thing has to do with the cult status of the film, something that defines the 80's in such a flashy way, it's almost blinding. 'Rocky IV' works as a kaleidoscope of all the cinematic stereotypes of the 80's, name one, you'll find it. First, by being (not another) sequel, the film incarnates one of the 80's most obvious trends, the necessary continuation of a money-making series. We forgive the musical montage since it's almost a trademark of the series, and 'Rocky IV''s training montage is particularly well done, the sight of Rocky Balboa climbing the frozen peaks of Russian mountains is dizzyingly inspiring and one of the franchise's best shot. We have the one-dimensional antagonist, through Ivan Drago, furthermore from Soviet Russia, the greatest cinematic propaganda villains' providers before September Eleven. Drago defines the film's age and his evilness is defined by one of the cruelest movie deaths after Bambi's mom: Apollo Creed. 'Rocky IV' is infamous for being the one where the glorious and charismatic Apollo is killed, so Rocky can get on the ring and take good old revenge, the most overused plot device of the sport genre.I could go on and on about the movie clichés, but these are the most blatant ones, and I even forgive the speaking robot offered to Paulie for his birthday, it was the 80's, when we thought we would all be in flying cars in the 2000's. All the archetypal elements I defined don't ruin the film, but they create a huge gap in quality with what the first opus stood for, a movie beyond all the traditional representations. 'Rocky' didn't need to win but to go the distance, Apollo was cocky but not evil, the montage was about building resistance not becoming a superhuman, and certainly not the revenge on a dead friend. Yes, I have a problem with Apollo's death, because it's so unlike the values incarnated by the series that it feels forced. I guess Stallone thought : 'Rocky needs a good reason to get back on the ring again' then he thought of a terminator-like opponent, Dolph Lundgren as Drago, the pride of USSR, a powerful athlete training with the most modern equipment and not without use of steroids, USSR so he can challenge America (Cold War days). And who's the most openly American on the heavyweight competition? Bingo. Apollo gets in the rings to get out of it two feet ahead. We have our pivotal moment..To make it simpler, my problem with 'Rocky IV' is that I started appreciating the film only after Apollo's death; the beginning was an artificially written build-up that doesn't match the quality of the rest of the film. And that's symptomatic of most of the sequels, they end up better than they started, I thought Adrian's coma and Rocky's struggle to find a job were too long in the second film, the training for Lang's fight in the third proved that obviously Rocky wasn't in the best shape to win, and the movie got better when Mickey died and Apollo trained Rocky. 'Rocky IV' sins with the same problem of obviousness, we know Drago will destroy Apollo, Apollo's pretension is so blatant it's like he forgot that he was beaten two years in a row, you'd think it would have taught him a lesson of humility. Apollo didn't even have the 'eye of the tiger' because he acted like a caricature of the first Apollo, with the whole 'Living in America' parade, James Brown, stars and striped short. We're always ahead of the characters and know what would happen, Stallone with an Oscar nomination for writing proved to have a talent to come up with inventive ideas, but in the 'Rocky sequels, he always seem more inspired in the second acts, probably confident that the ending would redeem the flaws in the beginning..And he's not totally wrong, the 'Rocky' films always have been about the ending, and the climactic fight, whose patriotically austere undertones contrasts with the flashiness of the first one, features probably one of the most painful to watch fights, yet awesome and entertaining. Rocky's journey in Russia becomes the reason to be of the film, and although the ending doesn't surprise us, it's handled with a positive message, here comes the 'we can change' speech, that sounds rather naive now, but doesn't deprive the film from a poignant humanistic value. I only wish it could have encouraged Stallone to write a less formulaic story, although it contains some unforgettable lines such as 'If he dies, he dies', Duke's repeated 'No pain' catchphrase, the classic 'I must break you' followed by probably one of my Top 10 lines from the film when Paulie tells Rocky: 'Remember what I said back there about wanting to be you?' Rocky nods, Paulies says: 'Forget it.' Apollo is no more with us, but thank God we have Paulie for the laughs, and Adrian for the heart.(On a last note, I always tried to point my finger on what the movie lacked besides the writing, and I remember that I always thought the movie featured the song 'The Final Countdown' one of the most defining music of the 80's, I was disappointed not to hear the song in 'Rocky IV' and I guess it would have been a huge contribution to the film, had it been used.)",6,0,1,2 February 2012
In the Name of the Father," In the Name of Respect, Dignity and Truth ...
","After 'My Left Foot', 1989' inspirational biopic of one of the most famous Irish artists, that received universal acclaim and earned his first Oscar to Daniel Day-Lewis, Jim Sheridan relates four years later another page of Irish history through 'In the Name of the Father', a powerful and solid drama comforting Day-Lewis' reputation as one of the most talented actors of his generation.'In the Name of the Father', chronicles the events that lead to the arrest of the infamous 'Guildford Four': four Irish people falsely accused and convicted for the bombing of the London pub of the same name. It's a nice directorial touch that the film opens with the explosion that killed five innocent persons, the very action that would imply a vengeance- ridden reaction from the British law. Innocent people would then pay for the crime, and this is the tragedy of Gerard Patrick Conlon, a feckless Irish lead stealer, who was in London at the wrong place, at the wrong moment.Yet even as a true story, the injustice and level of sadism displayed by the British Police, with the relative complicity of the Court, seem unbelievable, flirting with the most one- dimensional kind of cinematic Manichaeism. This is where the context plays a crucial role: after a series of bombing terrorizing the British population, the Parliament voted a Terrorism Act allowing the Police to arrest suspects for seven days. Although the use of torture was prohibited, any other kind of pressure became legitimate and could be used to force the suspects to sign a confession, or their own convictions' papers. We're in a sort of post September-11 like paranoia, where the British system, lacking all the necessary perspective to properly investigate the case would spot the perfect scapegoats to compensate their own ineffectiveness. Any rational mind wouldn't believe an IRA bomber or criminal mastermind would rob a prostitute and goes back to his home like Gerry did. But those were irrational, fear-induced times. The torture scenes benefits from the spectacular performance of Daniel Day-Lewis, as the tough hoodlum reveals a vulnerable side, demonstrating innocence in every single meaning of the word. The nervous breakdown is inevitable, marking the triumph of the sadist Police officer played by Corin Redgrave, followed by a tragic domino effect.Gerry's friends and family are all arrested, including his father Giuseppe, a honest, hard- working and sensible man. It was Giuseppe who encouraged Gerry to leave Belfast for London, fearing an arrest because of his illegal activities. And Giuseppe, the character who revealed the immense actor who was the late Pete Potlewhaite, is the soul of the film. He incarnates both the educational background of Gerry: an apparent failure, and a constant guiding force meant to elevate his son, to a level of dignity despite the adversity. The titular father is Giuseppe, and the gap between him and Gerry would trace the line of Gerry's evolution and understanding process, the ultimate key of his moral triumph. The roots of Day-Lewis' torments are to have given up the conflict against the system for the more convenient one: his father, the one who holds for being responsible of all his faults. By constantly patronizing him, Giuseppe forged Gerry's rebellious instinct. Gerry lost self- respect by blaming everything on his father. He never shared room with him, but this one fictionalization is perhaps the strike of genius because the best moments of the film all focus on the father-and-son relationship. Giuseppe accepts fate as it comes while Gerry fights back without thinking. Gradually, Gerry's experience will reveal the limits of his own perceptions, even when it comes to the Irish responsibilities. The jail scenes plays a powerful counterpart to the black-and-white depiction of the British justice and are also the setting of the greatest and most emotional performances from the trio Day-Lewis, Postlewhaite and Emma Thompson as the British lawyer who'd reopen the case and allow the 'Guildford Four' to be rejudged, for an immediate release, fifteen years after the first sentence. Giuseppe would never be a free man and his death from pulmonary condition would forge the spirit of his son and give a meaning to his fight for Justice. Jim Sheridan's film is a powerful human drama featuring a magnificent and emotionally gripping metamorphosis of the central character. However, the film suffers from a few flaws on the scenes' arrangements, a criticism I also had with 'My Left Foot' whose clumsy editing left a few interrogation marks, notably on the relationship between Day-Lewis and his father. 'In the Name of the Father' seems so eager to be a poignant father-and-son story, a character study that the trial part was treated with more rush, only leveraged by the powerful acting of Daniel Day-Lewis. A few less scenes would have allowed to focus on Thompson's investigation, and prevent the final trial from its rather abrupt or anticlimactic feeling, maybe less the trial than the way the pivotal evidence were found. However, this is rather a regret than a criticism, the film still relies on Day-Lewis tour de force and his believable transition from a young self-centered thug to a man who'd do his best to Honor the memory of his father It's fitting that one of the scenes feature 'The Godfather', especially the garden moment between Vito and Michael as the very scene represented the succession between the two persons, the transmission of heritage, between Giuseppe and his son, the transmission of common values. Conlon's personal fight would be to find out the part of him he had in common with his father, and make the most of it. In the Name of His Father.",9,0,0,10 February 2013
Being John Malkovich," An imaginative masterpiece with the most bizarre, yet profoundly intelligent, feeling ...
","'Being John Malkovich', what a title! I really didn't know what to expect exactly  an introspective film, some kind of intellectual drama essentially trying to capture the existential issues of the titular actor's tormented mind, I didn't think of a fantasy anyway, and certainly didn't anticipate this piece of cinematic creativity and visual awesomeness my mind would endure for less than two hours. 'Being John Malkovich' is not only one of the most creative movies of the last 20 years, but certainly one of the cleverest and most mind-bending and twisted scripts ever concocted from a newcomer, his name is Charlie Kauffman, and this is definitely one of these reviews that must start by a thunder of verbal applauds for the writing.Though the movie is not the most quotable of all, like 'Network' or 'Chinatown', it features more similarities with scripts à la 'Rashomon' or 'The Usual Suspects', these intricate puzzles where you have to assemble each piece until the end, but in the case of 'Being John Malkovich', it's less about a resolution or a revelation than how far a movie can exploit an inventive concept, how long it can hook the audiences' minds with an ingenious plot device. This is why the script is actually closer to movies like 'Back to the Future' and 'Groundhog Day'. And when the plot consists on having people being in someone else's body, let alone John Malkovich, well, besides the thrills, besides the laughs, the movie should feature a necessary level of depth. Indeed, when you have such a goldmine for plot twists, you must handle them carefully and on that level, Charlie Kauffman did it with a remarkable craftsmanship. And even if you expect to be surprised, it's nothing compared to the exhilarating cinematic experience of the first viewing.The symbolism that structures the whole narrative is highlighted during the opening credits where you discover a marvelous puppet's number directed by Greg Schwartz, John Cusack whose appearance immediately labels him in the antihero 'slash' loser category. Greg is so devoured by his own passion that he's totally neglecting his couple. And despite the apparent love between Greg and his wife Lotte, there's the strong feeling that both belong to two different worlds, he works in the basement, taking care of his puppets with the delicacy of a God-like figure caring about his creations, while Lotte, live with her animals on the top, creating a touching mini-zoo in the house. The only similarity between the two is their looks, by the way, only after the first half hour, I realized it was Cameron Diaz below that huge afro. Even though she's not the most feminine cinematic character, she genuinely wants children, but Greg seems reluctant because of his unemployment, which Lotte understands  the film doesn't waste its time with these two wannabe-anything and quickly gets to the point, when Greg replies to a job offer.Greg's skillful hands get him the job in a peculiar and mysterious 'filling' company set, in the 7th and half floor, probably the lowest roof from any work place. Go figure why Kauffman decided to insert an element that wouldn't have changed much the plot. I guess this is the difference between talented and great directors, the low roof element created a bit of visual jokes to distract us before the third element of the future love triangle makes her entrance, Catherine Keener as Maxine, Greg's ambitious, sexy co-worker, she talks straightforwardly and doesn't embarrass herself with social hypocrisy. For a man who lives with a girl like Lotte, now I understand why Cameron Diaz had to look anything but sexy, he naturally falls in love with the scene-stealing Maxine, but she's not interested. Now, all the pieces are ready and the game can start when Greg accidentally discovers a strange tunnel that leads to John Malkovich's body. Why Malkovich? How does it work? Why fifteen minutes in his body? That's the charm, did you really want to know why the Groundhog Day was repeating itself? I was so delighted by the premise I couldn't wait to see where this would get, until the intelligence's highlight of the film was reached when Lotte was John Malkovich and when what followed set a whole new psychoanalytical mood. The film is not about being John Malkovich, but becoming another person. Greg discovers the ultimate puppetry, as a man who brings life to objects, now he can insufflate life to a human being, dictating his gestures, his thoughts, his sexual impulses, being God in a pervert sort of way. Is his fantasy the sublime allegory of puppetry's beauty or is puppetry the incarnation of a sordid and lusty desire? Maxine doesn't need the experience because she's naturally a controlling woman, and her desire is to control John Malkovich while he's controlled by either Greg or Lotte. And for Lotte, it's the epiphany, the flash of realization that she's not trapped in John Malkovich, but in her own body, discovering finally the sensation of being a man. Lotte loves animals, she loves life, it's all about the sensation of living again, while Greg uses people as objects to satisfy his personal impulses. Maxine is simply torn between these two approaches, which might explain why she appealed to both Greg and Lotte.The movie reveals our deepest fantasies or sexual torments, the desire to be the same person in another body, sometimes from a different sex, to have one person we love in another body  in both cases it's about the distinction between the mind and the body as a source of discomfort or satisfaction, and John Malkovich's body is the humble setting of a mind-blowing experimentation highlighting our conditions as clumsy puppets directed by our consciences whose strings are pulled by our subconscious or by other persons or by sex, by God, you name them. A anyway, the result is an existential masterpiece questioning our own control on our lives!Malkovich!",10,0,2,19 September 2011
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Never cruel or mean-spirited, sometimes crude and raunchy, but always endearing and heart-warming ...
","'Father of the Bride', 'Honey I Shrunk the Kids' or 'The Hangover' most of the successful comedies originated from simple ideas with great comical potential; you got the original idea just by reading the title. And Judd Appatow's 'The 40 Year Old Virgin' is one of these comedies.Yet, relying on an excellent premise wasn't enough to be considered one of the funniest films of the year. Had the screenplay tried to mock the hero's condition and featured desperate attempts to have sex with a girl, in a sort of cross between 'American Pie' starring the kind of characters that Adam Sandler could have played, the film would have been 'another mindless sex comedy'. Instead, it's a witty and heart-warming little gem centered on one of the sweetest and most likable characters: Andy, played by Steve Carell. The critical success depended on one factor, simple but vital: the main character and I guess the surprise of 'The 40 Year Old Virgin' is even more pleasant when you expect a raunchy slapstick comedy with no heart.But as soon as we meet Andy, all the suspicions are swept off. He's a bachelor who works in a TV store and after many failures that suspended his trust on his own capacities, he abandoned the idea of ever having sex, and filled his life with toys' collections, virtual games, on-line poker, music and little-figurine paintings. He's not the typical dork with no-life, on the contrary, he has too much life, too many occupations working as time-fillers not to think about sex. He doesn't even compensate through masturbation or pornography, he is not mono-sexual but asexual. But Steve Carrell has a way to incorporate the flaws and the shy mannerisms of Andy with the right balance between charm and pathos. We feel sorry for him but we don't pity him, and never does the rooting process ever stop.And while the script, written by Appatow and Carell, could have take Andy's personality for granted as a source of gags, the masterstroke came with the peripheral characters, especially Andy's colleagues. David (Paul Rudd), Cal (Seth Rogen) and Jay (Romany Malco) invite Andy for a poker. And the inevitable happens, when invited to share a sex-related memory, Andy loses all credibility when he compares women's tits to bag of sands. This is a cleverly written scene, not just as a pivotal moment but because it's all in the reactions and the way we expect the male conversation to turn to sex, and from sex to the revelation. It's also a very well acted moment, where you can also notice the subtle performance of Rudd, and the way he observes Andy as if he already understood.The pay-off doesn't work on a comedic but rather on a human level. Cal is happy to learn that Andy is not the creepy 'serial killer' he expected, while Jay doesn't mock him, on the contrary, he believes it's an opportunity to help Andy, not help out of pity, help out of a feeling of true virile camaraderie. The point is that Andy is less a freak than a guy who didn't get his break, and each buddy, guided by his own view of life, elaborates a personal diagnosis and remedy to Andy's condition. Andy should learn to stop putting women (a subtle anatomic metonymy is used) on a pedestal, to go to parties where the drunker a girl is, the easier she'll be to get, all naturally, all these strategies end up failing, providing some hilarious gags in the process.And it's fitting that they fail, because the point is to provide insights on male perceptions about sex and women but it's only by controlling the situation that Andy has to succeed. And he finally meets Trish, an e-bay vendor working in a neighboring store. Keener delivers a sweet and tender performance as a woman who's not your typical cynical single-mom but rather kept her faith on men, and developed with Andy, a mutual fondness. She sees, like us, something in him. He's a good man who doesn't see sex as an Alpha and Omega, Trish also believes that they should put sex on stand-by, a convenience that naturally satisfies Andy. And that's the core of the film, sex doesn't make happiness like money, but like money, its lack can be handicapping. And Andy's friends welcome the new relationship but still advise him to get a sexual experience not to disappoint Trish. We know it's inevitable that she'll suspect something, but meanwhile, the film unveils some other aspects on the supporting characters. David can't get over his ex-girlfriend, Jay admits his lacks of self-confidence, the boss, Paula desperately needs sex, this puts their advice into perspective and show that no one is better than Andy. At the end it's just a wonderful and colorful gallery of characters that the film assembles to provide some insights about sex, gender and race, in an adult and never offensive way. Whether it's the staff mocking the two Oriental workers or the unforgettable 'I know why you're gay' exchange between Rudd and Rogen, the film has a way to take risks and never sounding offensive, quite a performance in our era poisoned by the tyranny of political correctness.'The 40 Year Old Virgin' starts with a cruel premise but the treatment of Andy's social handicap is never mean spirited and only works as the occasion to approach sex, and the way it helps or undermine love. It's an endearing love story between two sympathetic characters, and a wonderful casting celebrating in apotheosis the triumph of love through a hilarious musical parody at the end. It's one of the best comedies of the 2000's that didn't get any Golden Globe nomination, not for Carrell, not for Keener, not even one for Best Comedy and that's the only feeling of disappointment the film inspired me.",9,0,1,21 October 2012
Face_Off," Like looking in the mirror...
","Well, let's face it, for all its (over)use of cases, shootouts and stunts as spectacular as they're formulaic, 'Face/Off' is more than your average show-off action-packed thriller. The film stands off above all its peers thanks to one simple but genius premise, so creative and incongruous, you've got to wonder how come they waited till Cinema was 100 years to think about having the hero and the villain switching their faces, and see where this is getting, not that it would have required many special effects, right? I can imagine, not without excitement, the brainstorm that lead to the plot genesis: the two guys have to hate each other, the villain isn't just the antagonist, he's the hero's nemesis, so a cop and a criminal isn't enough, how about making it personal like say, the bad guy accidentally kills the hero's son, the hero's got a reason to hate him and apparently the villain seems to hold some serious grieves against him, that's for the reciprocity. What next? Well, how about the big question, why would they switch the faces? Well, because the hero will have to pass as the bad guy to know a secret, what kind of secret, the kind of emergency life-and-death secrets, a code of some sort bingo, a bomb.Now, we need someone the bad guy trusts blindly, let's give him a brother and while you're at it, give them some kind of legendary pairing names, Achilles and Ajax, Romulus and Remus or Castor and Pollux we progress. So, suppose they take Castor's face and implant it on the hero, let's call him Sean (like John but more original), everyone would know? No, it has to be a secret mission to ensure its success. Wait; will Castor remain face-less? Of course not, this is where it's getting tricky. Suppose he wakes up, he discovers the plan and ask the doctors to implant Sean's face on his before getting rid of them. Wow, talk about the perfect set-up, I can only imagine the first face-to-face between the two guys. Now, we've got our first 'great and memorable moment'.And the creative implications of the film are countless, the immersion of the criminal within the very family he dispossessed from one son, his luscious looks on 'his' own daughter, or the bad guy having to team up with criminals. But wait, how about the initial motive, the bomb and all that stuff? Well this is the icing on the cake, Castor tells his brother who he is, he discards the bomb and he's the town hero. Now I'm sure it didn't take more than an hour to get the spine of the film and this is not to diminish its merit, but to highlight the positive effects of inventiveness. All it takes is one hell of an idea and the rest is only coverage, the writing, the spectacular effects, all the most significant departments of film-making are involved, on the top of them: acting.It goes without saying that the film couldn't have existed if Castor was played by Danny De Vito and Sean by Arnold Schwarzenegger, although the premise of a spoof-remake would be hilarious. So they needed two actors of the same size shape and caliber, well, I guess they got it right with John Travolta and Nicholas Cage, two of the most bankable actors of the 90's, fittingly blue-eyed, hairy-chested and equally tall and strong. Well, of course, the suspension of disbelief asks more from us. Many persons would point out the possibility of the cop's wife to notice some differences in some specific parts of their husbands' anatomy. Although, it's not improbable that in the heat of the passion, a woman wouldn't notice, but then how about the hands, feet, well, it asks a lot but let's not to be too technical.Indeed, one of the film's strengths is not to focus too much on the scientific material, 'Face/Off' could easily be labeled as Sci-fi movie, but it focuses more on the change of personalities and the way too men who hate each other, learn to live in another skin. It's an insightful examination of the eternal correlation between what we are and how we look, and that the whole 'don't look at me' can't work in real life. I have one scene in mind right now, when the daughter helps Castor because she simply can't believe he is not her father. But I got so carried away by those details that I forgot I had to talk about the acting, which is the little spice the film provided, for our greatest delight, and for both Travolta and Cage who certainly took it as an extraordinary challenge.I recently suggested a poll asking which of the two actors gave the better performance as the other's character. Now, I realize it's an unfair question, because the two actors didn't try to impersonate each other, not quite. They played their personal version of good guys and villains, and made them match. Nicholas Cage has a unique way to make his eye bulge and look demonically frightening while Travolta puts it all in that devilish smile and menacing eyes, obviously with Travolta's face, you can't mimic expression made possible with Cage's. But Cage has also an extraordinary capacity to look sad and sensitive, it's all in the eyes again  and Travolta's puts it in the smile, and it works again. I rooted for Cage as a good guy equally as for Travolta and thought they were charismatic as bad guys.'Face-Off' might be labeled as an action pop-corn movie but its power and awesomeness lies on the fact that it didn't take Woo's directing skills (indeed, it's spectacular from A to Z) for granted but involve everything that makes movies worth to watch, and naturally, it didn't make the unforgivable mistake to deprive us from a mirror-scene.",8,2,3,24 April 2014
Shrek Forever After," Shrek coming full circle with himself, to be happy, and live happily ever after... once and for all...
","Concluding my review of 'Shrek the Third', I wondered what was awaiting the green ogre for its fourth adventure. After meeting his true love, her parents, getting ready for and having children, a fourth part could only let me expect something on the level of a midlife crisis. Granted the animators have enough imagination to create something satisfying, if not overwhelming, I still didn't think I would get so close.In 'Forever After', Shrek is in the same state we left him at the end of the third opus, enjoying his role as a father, teaching his triplets how to properly burp, waving at the tourists who visit the swamp and inviting Donkey, his hybrid kids, and Puss to tell their adventures' stories. But while his life seems to be governed by the same routine, his enthusiasm slowly fades out, he starts to question the meaning of his life, remembering the time when he was a 'wanted' ogre, not a local joke, and when he was alone and free, basically, being the Shrek we meet one decade before. In a way, he echoes the sentiment of some angry fans who miss the good old Shrek.That self-questioning Shrek reflects the way his long journey has transformed him on the surface, but not much in reality, and that's the closer you can get to a midlife crisis in animation's language. And as predictable as this premise sounds, it was perhaps the best one to conclude the monster's existential journey. In the first, he had to to discover his value as a person, as someone capable to love and be loved, and Fiona was the key to this discovery. In the second, he had to learn to love himself. In the third one, , he had to accept to be a father, to engage in a serious relationship. But this issue had less to do with his status as an ogre and this is why I failed to connect it with the previous opuses and I don't think the characters of Charming or Arthur were worthy additions.But in the fourth, we touch the essence of Shrek's personality: being an ogre, scaring people and children, living alone in a remote place, enjoying mud bath and not roaring because a chubby creepy kid asks you to do so (I admit that 'do the roar' line stuck in my mind and became an instant favorite from the whole franchise). The two middle films questioned the 'happily ever after' assumption but with too mature issues (responsibility, family etc.) Now, an ogre who'd love to be an ogre again, that's the kind of stuff even a kid can get and enjoy, I think it was the only one that could have a fourth film work especially when it tells you that it is the final chapter, so we enjoy it even more because we know this is the last time we see this gallery of characters who visited us every three years, as it became a sort of tradition.Of course, now that Shrek has kids and all must end well that ends well, we know the journey must end with Shrek realizing how lucky he is, and to get the point, he must lose first what he took for granted and this is where the villain Rumplestitk let's just call him Rumple, makes his entrance. Rumple makes a Faustian deal with Shrek: he gets one day where he is unknown and can scare people while Rumple can take any day of Shrek's life. The problem is that ever since 'Back to the Future', we know that Shrek is signing his own death warrant through this contract. And while Shrek isn't the brightest bulb, it's a bit frustrating not to see the scam.So what must happen happens, he enjoys a day of anonymity before realizing that life has changed for worse Biff Tannen, I mean Rumple became the king of Far Far Away. Alternate reality, that was the trick, how to make new stuff with old one. Shrek must conquer back Fiona's heart to cancel the curse (no curse without an antidote). But that's not as easy as it looks, Fiona became the leader of a group of revolutionary ogres, Donkey works for the witches who are to Rumple what the hyenas were to Scar, and the purpose of the whole second act (the less exciting one) is to allow Fiona to fall again in love with Shrek, so that Shrek can celebrate Christmas with his friends, and 'gives his petals back to Zuzu'.The second act left me a bit cold, I liked the way the usual characters behaved differently by still being true to their nature (fat Puss in Boots was fun to some extent), but it's only the third act that brings all the emotionality, the ending that the third one needed to have. I won't spoil the final lines, but they were so beautiful I wished no one would speak after that, and no one did. It was also a great nod to the first film to have 'I'm a Believer' concluding the last one, as to remind us of this 2001 year where Shrek became a cultural phenomenon, an achievement from a non-Disney character.And it's a deserved reputation because there's a Shrek in all of us, we all have personal issues, we all wish to be different, taller, skinnier, and we all question our past. I myself spend my life wishing I hadn't made this or that mistake, but then I realize that all my mistakes, one leading to another, made me meet my wife and have a beautiful daughter. So it was all worth it. I don't know if I'll live happily ever after that, but it just allows me to look forward to the future with sheer optimism.And now that Shrek has learned the lesson, we can wish him to live happily ever after, once and for all.",7,0,0,8 August 2016
Collateral," Karma hangs on the tiniest details, like a perfect script...
","Reviewing 'Collateral', I'm tempted to use my rhetorical shtick, praising the film's noir undertones while throwing in each paragraph words like 'existential', 'nightmarish', 'life-changing' or 'character-study'. But watching this film a third time made me question my habits and my certitudes as deeply as I could relate to Max, the humble and sympathetic cab driver who gets a real taste of that vague notion of something 'that happens' and that starts with S. And that's exactly the point, Max at 6 pm doesn't know it yet, but he'll be a totally different man at 4 am.What happened to make this transition so believable and captivating is something I don't want to intellectualize much; its intelligence speaks for itself. So many directors try to achieve greatness through artsy stuff and heavy symbolism, but Michael Mann doesn't need any of these artifices. All it took was a good script, good actors and a good story, perfectly crafted by Stuart Beattie, with profound dialogues that never feel overwritten. It is crucial because the film's tension relies on the credibility of the interactions between Max (Jamie Foxx) and his client, Vincent, the ruthless killer played by Tom Cruise. If Max is the talkative driver who asks customers where they're from, he becomes a cliché and the film is over, just as if Vincent was a sort of human Terminator.This is a film of a few characters but with no room for improvisation. Speaking of this, one of the most memorable moments involves a jazz-man played by Barry Shabaka Henley. He's got such a terrific story about Miles Davis that it is worth watching the film just to hear that man recalling one of his life's happiest moments. I wasn't surprised, watching the bonus features, that Mann and Beattie had written detailed back-stories about each character so they could be immersed into their lives just before playing them. What Cruise, Foxx and all the other cast-members did was approaching the lives of their characters even when it didn't interfere with the story. Mark Ruffalo took shooting lessons although he never fires his gun. The point is to make you care for the character as someone with a past, before watching him in the present, which is the whole point of Max and Vincent's conflicting principles: once you know someone's past, you can't shoot him.Now, take the very first scene between Max and Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith), at first, he knows exactly how long the road will take and how to avoid traffic jams. That's not a detail, when we spend days and days driving in the same town, we know these things. I trust Mann who knows L.A. more than any other director and if I did a movie about Casablanca, I could also reach such precision. But see how this works in the film, from his exactitude when it comes to predict the exact timing, he manages to elicit a positive response from her and one thing leading to another, he tells her about his plans to start a limo company and that his cab business is all temporary, that's the way relationships start. And when she leaves, we immediately understand why Max is angry, he forgot to give his phone number but then she comes back and gives him her card, it's even better because that just saved her life. Had Max given his phone number, she would be dead by the end.And this hazardous aspect of Karma structures the film: if two cops weren't called in emergency, they would be dead too, if Max hadn't shouted for help, two thugs would've been alive. Sometimes, life hangs on the tiniest details, like a good script. In 'Collateral' many things are immediately guessable when you pay attention to the lines, to the body language. Max' exactitude also plays like a conversation starter with Vincent, although he doesn't expand his heart but he says that he wants to start a business and makes enough an impression on Vincent so that he inevitably asks him to drive him the whole night, for seven-hundred dollars, Max needs money and Vincent, with his gray suit and gray hair, looks like the man of his job, Max' instinct is failed. In fact, all through the film, many mistakes are guided by habits, routines and misguiding instincts, in other words, things we take for granted.Viewers also take things for granted with action movies: shootouts, car chases seem like obligatory ingredients but the way it is handled by Mann is beyond any clichés. I used to dislike the ending because it felt too conventional but then I realized it made some clever and stylish nods to Hitchcock and it was the only way to make Vincent's entrance in Max' life pay off. Had Vincent killed Max and Annie, it would have been pointless and then make Vincent's point about life's pointlessness in the 'grand scheme of things' but that was an angle the script didn't take. If anything, 'Collateral' proved that the world is, paraphrasing 'Se7en', a nasty place worth fighting for. Vincent wasn't 100% wrong though since his death did prove his initial point about people's carelessness.In fact, there are many things in Vincent that Max uses for his own good and that might help him for the future by the end of the day, Max has learned a lot about himself, and gotten many things straight by 'finally' acting like Vincent. That's how you close a character's arc. As for Vincent's arc, I was wondering how could a pro like him miss Max in the subway, the reason is even more brilliant, he's a professional. Vincent trademark three-point shooting two in the thorax, one in the head hit the sliding door, Max shot on the glass and got him, as simple as that, like Max, Vincent was victim of his habits.See, 'Collateral' is very good but with an eye for detail, it becomes a masterpiece.",10,1,3,18 April 2017
The Intouchables," Touché ...
","In less than two months, 'Untouchable' became the second most successful French film by number of spectators, such an event by itself that people went then to see it, not because they thought it was good but to see what was so good in it: that's the virtual circle of success. My biggest disappointment in 2011 was with 'The Tree of Life', a movie I sincerely wanted to love but couldn't, and I left the theater before it ended with a bitter taste of frustration. Proportionally, my greatest positive surprise came with 'Untouchable' because it was the opposite expectation: I was sure I would dislike it, figuring the movie manipulated viewers through the overused device of the improbable friendship. Why such preconceived negativity? Well, when a young black guy from French suburbs, darkly depicted in Mathieu Kassovitz 'Hate' and infamous for its occasional riots, befriends a rich quadriplegic, I immediately think of 'good feelings', 'mainstream populism'  unaware that I apply to myself a cynical judgment that can undermine my very way to enjoy not just this film, but any film. After all, why getting ready for hatred when it's so relieving to give the benefit of the doubt and get ready for appreciation? Especially since more than 15 millions of French people, from different ages and backgrounds liked it. So, I saw it  and loved it.The story of 'Untouchable' is the kind of unintentional masterpiece that only movies can provide every once in a while, it has no other pretension than to depict a magnificent and inspiring friendship story starting as a simple job. A young man with a Senegalese background, Omar Sy as Driss, only needs a signature to prove that he attended an interview for a live-in carer job. For some strange reason, Paul, the rich man, played by a wonderful François Cluzet, gives him the job, with a one-month trial period. The reason of this choice is smoothly handled by the script: the film starts with all the job applicants, every one of them unnaturally posing and getting mixed in prepared answers. Then, Driss casually enters, without waiting for his turn or knocking on the door, he's got enough problems to deal with, unemployment, an experience in jail, being a pariah for society, and undesirable even in his own family, especially her adoptive aunt. Driss' attitude pleases Paul, because after his paragliding accident, he can't feel his body from neck to toes, and needs caring almost 24 hours per days and 7 days per week, so he really doesn't have time for bullshit either. And this is a remarkable aspect in the script written by the two directors Eric Toledano and Olivier Nakache: it doesn't waste time cementing the friendship, the two leads rapidly get fond of each other, a feeling illustrated in the poster with both posing with natural smiles. The film shows Omar's struggle to learn how 'needy' Paul is, which provides some priceless comedic moments, but 'Untouchable' goes immediately to the core, an eye-opening message about the life endured by a handicapped person, making all the wealth in the world pointless and the richness of heart and mind, priceless. Through Driss and Paul's interaction, the film explores the real needs of people in life, respect and understanding, acceptance and love. Maybe if it was handled by other directors, it would have been predictable but in 'Untouchable', the complicity between the two heroes feels absolutely real. There's one scene when Driss shave the bushy beard of Paul, well, I won't spoil it for you, but the part was a clever mix of realism and comedy because anyone would have done what Driss did at one moment, and that's the secret of the film: it feels real.Some movies can work with a good story but they need good performances, in 'Untouchable', it's almost impossible to determine who carried the film, both Cluzet and Sy were great. And I don't get the complaints: why they didn't respect the original story where the carer was an Arab, or how they 'sugarcoated' the handicap? I even heard that in America, they were accusing the film of racism because Driss was portrayed as a sort of (I quote) 'helper monkey'? Seriously, this is getting old The way handicap is approached never flirts with an exaggerated pathos, nor the opposite, which is the most intelligent achievement. There's a sort of heart's intelligence in the way Omar teases Cluzet with his own handicap, and the film provides the extraordinary message that pleasure and thrills have unlimited media, whether they come from pot, an ear-massage or even paragliding. Many of Paul's friends criticizes the presence of Driss in Paul's life, but Paul doesn't care: Omar is a man full of life, big, tall and strong, and when he uses violence to teach a man the respect of a parking sign, Paul admits this is the right method. Both are in the same wavelength. I wondered if the title 'Untouchable' referred to the lowest caste in India, echoing the two men's conditions, both outcasts physically and socially, but I guess, their relationship evolves into a friendship precisely because they're both strong-minded, and together, they become even stronger, until getting untouchables ... in the noblest meaning of the word.There are real people in 'Untouchable', nothing works as plot devices even if some situations are so cinematically appealing: Omar inviting everybody to dance during Paul's birthday, his learning of the aristocratic world, the art of abstract painting, and the way he breaks the conventions with an unconventional charisma reaches a level of energetic comedy that reminds of the greatest days of Eddie Murphy, with Cluzet as a perfect straight-man not deprived from a sense of humor. 'Untouchable' is simply an inspiring story of friendship with whatever defines this beautiful virtue. And yes, it's one of the best French films ever, and certainly one of the best of 2011.",10,313,351,17 January 2012
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," The 'Harry Potter' franchise at (broomstick's) cruising speed...
","Animaguses and werewolves, a flying hypogriff, which is a pleonasm, night buses, talking paintings, time turners and so on and so forth... all these exciting products of J.K. Rowling's fruitful imagination blending with centuries of fantasy literature, bloom as smoothly as naturally in the third opus of the Harry Potter's series: 'Prisoner of Azkaban'. I liked it a lot and I was surprised by how much I liked it.Indeed, after two movies, I started to notice patterns within the structure ... sometimes they enhanced my excitement, some others, I wasn't quite sure whether I wanted to experience them again. For instance, I knew the film would start at the Dursleys and I was wondering what kind of mischief Harry would inadvertently cause, I wasn't disappointed and Pam Ferris sure got what she deserved for insulting his parents. I also liked that for once it was Harry going out by himself telling viewers in all subtext that Harry has grown up and wouldn't take it anymore.I was also expecting a few newcomers: as the new Defense Against Dark Arts teacher, Professor Rupin, David Thewlis proved to be a nice addition and so was Emma Thompson as a Professor Sybill Trelawney. I expected of course a new villain, and seeing Gary Oldman introduced as Sirius Black, the man who caused the murder of Potter's parent, I expected quite a climax. But all positive expectations put aside; in all fairness, there was something perplexing about the title.'Prisoner of Azkaban' made me expect a prison (duh!) so I visualized a high dungeon or a dark tower over a high cliff with many passageways and corridors inside. Which means that after the claustrophobic and unnerving journey around the 'Chamber of Secrets', I wasn't too excited by the premise of another in-door adventure. So you can imagine how much I enjoyed 'Azkaban' and its departure from the usual settings. Most of the adventure takes place outside Hogwarts, and features great exterior shots. It says a lot that the film wasn't Oscar-nominated for Best Set Design.However, it was nominated for Best Score and Best Visual Effects and on that level, the film is an absolute delight. 'Secrets' was made of variations from the previous score because John Williams had a busy year but here, he makes a spectacular come-back with a score that is as heart-pounding and triumphant as any fantasy epic, far from the ominous and whimsicality of the original score. And the visuals remind us that CGI reached a point of maturation in 2004, though Alfonso Cuaron, the newly assigned director, didn't let them overtake the film and the best computer effects are never obtained without the involvement of some practical ones.So 'Azkaban' is an outdoor adventure, perfectly suitable for three protagonists whose ages are around 13 or 15 and seem more fit to be running over a hill, flying on an apogriff or finally punching the odious Malefoy in the face, than any riddle to solve within the confined walls of Hogwarts. It's like the scope of the adventure was too big for the school and allowed us viewers to have some relief and a share of fun as Harry attempts to catch Sirius Black and avenge his parents' death. That would be too linear of course so within his journey, many obstacles will be set as well as many opportunities to unveil many secrets.And that's the mark of the best franchises, they don't touch the pillars (the leading trio, Dumbledore, Hagrid, Snape and even Malefoy) they enrich the gallery with new protagonists and plot elements, but they also dig deeper in the past and reveal a whole chain of events that preceded Harry Potter, as if the story was only one link of an epic chain, one that involves so many characters the franchise start to strike as a real universe where each member gets into a passage rite consisting of a substantial contribution to the plot. In 'Secrets', Ron took part to the climax without Hermione, 'Azkaban' allows Hermione to finally shine and contribute to the resolution. Characters start to act like heroes on their own and not just foils.And all the teachers and courses are left to the backdrop. Seriously, I didn't expect the film to be contain such a great deal of escapism but it says a lot about the seriousness upon which Rowling and the Warner Bros studios considered the franchise and insisted on maintaining this capability to precede the viewers or the readers' anticipations, to surprise them. And that's the least one would expect from a series dealing with the world of wizardry, isn't it? And any innovation works because we're getting used to the world of spells and magical formulas so we can accept any new trick as long as it has rules of its own.And it all comes down to that last nice time-playing twist I didn't see coming, and that could have been contrived if it wasn't foreshadowed in previous scenes. Yes, the Harry Potter plays tricks with us but never without elements of foreshadowing, even some that weren't meant to foretell anything. Yes, they play tricks with us, and in retrospect, they often work. : from a simple pet animal that hides a terrible secret to the explanation of why Hermione is so studious and always ahead of her schoolmates.Though the story didn't get darker than 'Secrets', it goes deeper in Harry's fears and traumas and features some of the most frightening creatures after you-know-who in the Dementors (the guardians of Azkaban). But the tone is quite lighthearted and the film has more the flavor of a teen adventure than a fantasy movie, but don't get it wrong, it's still a Harry Potter, and the series is definitely at cruising speed. Broomstick-wise of course.",9,2,3,18 November 2018
Ratatouille," The Cook is a Rat, his Cooking is an Art...
","While in the past, an imposing belly was the sign of good wealth, today: the poorer, the fatter.Indeed, good and healthy taste, in our junk/frozen/industrialized-food consuming society, became a luxury. This might explain the success of cooking-related TV programs, the sight of an appetizing meal is as rewarding to our senses as if it was eaten. Some surrender to bad food, out of laziness, those who don't learn to cook and are rewarded by the certitude that they'll always eat well, in total respect to their tastes and their stomachs.But can anyone cook? The question is raised in Disney Pixar's animated movie 'Ratatouille', released in 2007, and it's as serious and defining as a problem in a high school essay. Everything in the film subtly relates to that simple question. Is the required discipline and dedicated available to the common mortal? The film doesn't provide answers, it's too adult for that, it just gratifies us with two great characters and let us figure out for ourselves. Of course, the most important and fascinating one is that blue rat, Remy, whose dream is to become a chef. The title 'Ratatouille' is very well chosen as it plays on the word 'rat' and an iconic French meal, it also contributes to one of the most original climactic moments for any film.Remy is a fascinating character, even by Pixar standards, contrarily to many usual leads, his goal isn't conditioned by a specific mission, limited to the film's time-frame. This is a rat with a highly developed sense of taste and smell that was first used in order to detect poison. But later, RÃ©my felt he had a gift, he could recognize good food and from that, could learn about cooking. His idol is Chef Gusteau, a French cook whose motto was 'anyone can cook'. Remy used to watch him on a TV belonging to the old lady (whose house served as a refuge to the rats' colony) until discovering the chef died a long ago because of a scathing critic from Anton Ego who was probably to food what Pauline Kael was to the movies. This is a rather dark moment in the film where it's impossible not to believe the chef committed suicide, this is no joke in France as previous chef Bernard Loiseau committed suicide after losing one star is the fear Michelin Guide, the book whose effects can either be beneficial or disastrous.But it's still a Disney film and not to discomfort young viewers, Gusteau is resurrected in Remy's imagination. After escaping from the old lady's gunshots, his family vanishes in the sewer while he floats on the cooking book and maybe hallucinating out of hunger, discusses with the illustrated Gusteau (who's like 'Ghosto' all through the film). Remy wonders if anyone can cook as the chef pretends. But he actually gives another meaning to the question, it's not 'can anyone cook, even an amateur?' but 'can anyone cook, even a rat?' Remy will prove that, even as a rat, he can cook to perfection because he belongs to the category of gifted people who take cooking seriously. And he's immediately gotten the opportunity to prove his talent by fixing a soup almost spoiled by a new sous-chef hired in Gusteau's restaurant.Linguini is a lanky and awkward boy in his early twenties, he's hired by Gusteau's former sous-chef, a diminutive and sneaky-looking cook named Skinner. When he accidentally spills the soup and blindly drops ingredients in it, Remy manages to fix it, and the soup catches the attention of a prestigious critic. It's a matter of time before Linguini and Remy discover that they can communicate, and Remy becomes to Linguini what Cyrano was to Christian, a Ghost cook, so to speak, managing to guide his body in order to cook the perfect food. This is also a nice pretext to some of the film's best visual gags, the most explicit manifestations of slapstick and visual humor in a rather serious film. The smallness and fastness of Remy, the nonchalant and thin silhouette of Linguini creates great interaction, but it's the complicity between the two that drive the story.The second act allows us to discover that Linguini is Gusteau's unknown son and is likely to inherit the restaurant, which gives Skinner a status of clear antagonist. Meanwhile, a conventional romance develops between Linguini and Colette, the only female chef of the team (made of very interesting characters) and I think there was enough relationships in the film, Remy and his brother and father and even Linguini to really make us care for the romance. The crew was made of intriguing and interesting guys but their under-use didn't come as a surprise given how RÃ©my and Linguini formed a solid pair. Colette was a colorful and interesting character on her own but she didn't need to be in love with Linguini to help him. So, the film loses its track until a fantastic climax whose merit is not to rely on the traditional confrontation of good vs. evil.Anton Ego, tastes a piece of 'ratatouille' and lives a wonderful Madeleine Proust episode. In a way, this Madeleine moment makes the film's point about cook, it's an emotional connection, we love food that reminds us of something. I'll never forget the first tiramisu I ate, the best and I couldn't find the same taste. Food is something that revives emotions, mostly positive, it can indeed draw a smile in your face, and this is the power of 'Ratatouille', it's inspirational on countless levels.I can imagine a kid dreaming of being a cook thanks to 'Ratatouille', which is a serious vocation-inspiring film, but supposing Gusteau was wrong and not anyone can cook, then I hope the film's beautiful story will inspired kids to dream of being capable to bring the same joy and happiness to people by doing something with as dedication, love and passion as Remy.",9,0,1,13 April 2016
The Lego Movie," Like the Title Song says...
","Today, before watching an animated movie, the biggest question is 'which element of newness can it ever provide to eyes that have enjoyed hundreds of Disney (and even DreamWorks) classics?' Indeed, as time goes by and the audiences get more blasé, the probability for an animated film to meet with commercial success might be relatively high, but whether it would stand the test of time and become a classic is another story. Each of the three 'Shrek' sequels did pretty well in the box-office, but compared to the first opus, they're all pretty forgettable.But this is an adjective I wouldn't use for 'The Lego Movie' as it is a wonderfully crafted and smartly conceived animated comedy. It doesn't just bring enjoyment; it also possesses such a meticulous attention to little details that you wouldn't mind watching it again in case you missed something. Of course, the very premise of an animated movie made of Lego bricks is to challenge the eyes with as many details as one can spot in a simple blink, that's the essence of the Lego bricks, but the writers or creators didn't just take that high-concept for granted: the special effects are the vehicles to a solid plot and a story with a message that is positive without being dull or predictable.There's a moment where all the protagonists meet in Cuckoo Cloud Land (or was it Cloud Cuckoo Land)? And although some of the characters in the background add nothing to the story, the multiple cameos they form is simply irresistible (they go from Simpsons characters to Ninja Turtles or movies and fairy tales icons) you really have to push the pause button if you want to spot each of them. This perfectionism has nothing to envy on Disney's and reward our expectations as we don't expect uncluttered landscapes from a Lego film. And while it starts with Lego Land and the ominous President Business' building, it also gets out of the urban zone of comfort and make us fly over the vast Western canyons or enjoy a trip on and under the sea, the occasion for many cool effects simulating waves, smokes or clouds.Last time I had as much fun was with 'Rango' and there's some kinship between the two films besides not being from Disney (or another 3D major studio), they have extremely appealing heroes. Rango had a certain edgy quality but Emmett (Christ Pratt) is simply too sweet for words. It's like the writers, instead of taking the wrong step and making the most possibly original character, went to the totally opposite trajectory, making an even more original one. This is a Lego-man who sees the half filled glass, who cheers at everything, because in Lego life, everything is built upon instructions, you can't do any wrong because that's an option life doesn't include. So nothing can upset him: the lousy one-joke sitcom, the overpriced coffee, his motto echoes the town's hymn 'Everything is Awesome', a cheesy electronic pop hit that seems to come directly from the 90's. But under this cheerful front, Lego Land lives with an impending doom of evil President Business (Will Ferrell) and according to Vitrivirus, a wizard with the voice of Morgan Freeman, a chosen one will save the town (quite a prophecy, isn't it?), it turns out to be Emmett, but he needs to believe it to succeed. The film takes one of the cheesiest clichés but makes it the soul of its message and making something original out of conventional stuff is a stunt I didn't think was possible. And the is the kind of masterstroke I won't dare to spoil but let's just say, there comes a moment where even the comedic inventiveness can't drive the plot, and the writers need an extra push and we make the one discovery that gives its full meaning to the Lego, the reason why anyone can enjoy it.Speaking for myself, I stopped playing Lego when I got a new digit in my age but playing now with my daughter, I rediscover the appeal behind this simple but genius concept, interlocking brick one or another, creating more and more challenging forms, some with a meaning, others not, but avoiding dullness at all costs. There is something in Lego that is so boundlessly creative, that you can't help but feel the need to reinvent stories or scenarios within the limits of your mind's imagination. It's just as if the 3D animation existed before the screen version, and 'The Lego Movie' was inevitable. And it is perhaps the only animation process where the temptation of portraying the 'player' was so strong, as if there was something subtly existential or deeply metaphysical in that quest for perfection. I had a foretaste after watching the Simpsons 'Lego' episode, there's indeed some great source of creativity behind these little bricks.Nevertheless, this quest for perfection is integral to the film's appeal, so is the need to deconstruct things for the sake of imagination. There was something in that Cuckoo Land that reminded me of South Park's 'Imagination Land', and this is what the film is about: the power of imagination, and that includes imagining yourself as a hero, and being able to build and to decompose as well. And not to make the film sounds too philosophical, it is also a terrific comedy with superb characters, including Elizabeth Banks as the bad-ass WyldStyle (the jokes about her names never get old), a 80's Spaceman and Unikitty, a hilarious mix of Hello Kitty and 'My Little Pony' style unicorns.Honorable mention to the scene-stealing performance by Bruce Wayne aka Batman and a funny twist on the good cop/bad cop trope, well it's full of pop culture references, they're good but they're not even the best thing about the film.Everything is awesome in that 'Lego' movie and I'm looking forward for the sequels.",9,0,1,10 January 2017
Aliens," Add an 'S' to a classic and you'll get another classic...
","Ridley Scott had set the bar so high with his groundbreaking 'Alien' No one thought a sequel would be a good idea. Those were the times...Why a sequel anyway? The first Alien was history, Ellen Ripley was the lone (human) survivor and getting back in that doomed rock wasn't the smartest move. Much more the film was a modern horror classic and any attempt to recreate the claustrophobia of the Nostromo would have induced more déja-vu than jump scares. Paraphrasing the original tag-line, a sequel would've been ''Jaws 2' in a spacecraft.'But Canadian director James Cameron wasn't a newcomer in the mid-80's. 'Terminator' had thrilled the audiences with a simple concept: an indestructible machine set to kill a girl next door (literally), a nightmarish ride with no other option than fighting and the sweet Linda Hamilton turning into a match to Arnold Schwarzenegger. Basically, Cameron told a story with a familiar David vs. Goliath structure and character's arc, his 'Alien' was the Terminator and his 'Ripley' was Sarah Connor.And I think I can recreate the whole brainstorming that shaped the sequel. I guess the first question echoed the purpose of the sequel: what is scarier than an alien? Two aliens or how about a colony, or how about a human colony invaded by the aliens who need human for incubation purposes. Then all you have to do is find a way to justify how the colonization of the « alien » planet took place without taking Ripley's warning into consideration. Then all you have to do is let her drift for as many years as it takes, even if it means losing her family, her daughter... and she might find a 'daughter' figure in her mission. Of course, they'll need Ripley who's the only human being to have encountered the Alien, but since she's the only one to know how dangerous they are, how about spicing it up with a corporate prick who'd love to bring an Alien to Earth... do we need a treacherous android again ?See, the most complex stories can originate from a simple question which happens to be the right one. At the end, we have the plot that became a staple of the action genre, a group of hardened soldiers of various experiences and levels of bravery assigned to a supposedly routine mission (a 'bug hunt') with only two people who know the real stakes, Ripley obviously, and Carter Burke (Paul Reiser) as the slimy executive who managed to make himself more detestable than any Alien. It's a smart demarcation from the original where the secondary villain wasn't human (by the way, I wonder if it's a coincidence that 'Burke' is the sound of disgust in French).The casting also includes Michael Biehn the unsung hero of 'Terminator', the late Bill Paxton as the easily-freaking-out one, William Hope as the inexperienced Lieutenant, Lance Herrikssen as Bishop the android and scene-stealing Jennette Goldstein as Vasquez, the real female badass. There's also Boggs from 'Shawshank', a cigar-chomping sergeant who goes too soon, a few forgettable faces and Carrie Henn as little Newt. Her military salute to a panic-stricken Paxton is one of these moments that make the film more than a formula picture. If it's full of establishing moments and typical wisecracks in the beginning, once the the chips are done, three-dimensional personalities are unveiled. And there's a reason why I insisted on Vasquez' being the badass one.Again, Sigourney Weaver plays Ellen Ripley in the humblest and most pragmatic way, she's involved because she hates the Aliens, she knows what they're up to, and nuking them is the only option. She's not a military officer, no gun expert, yet because of the Marines' inexperience, two-faced Burke and her promise to never abandon Newt, she becomes the only one capable to defeat the Aliens, not because of fighting skills, but because she has a protective instinct, an intuition for the right moves... and sometimes, a lighter. Ripley is like a more experimented version of Sarah Connor, triumphing over her fears until the unforgettable Power loader moment and the climactic line.The only match for Ripley was a 'witch' indeed and that was decades before strong women became a marketed trope. Here, the film culminates with the fight between two Mama Bears, when the Aliens are all defeated and there's still the Queen. So we had aliens in tunnels, we had the glowing dots, we had a face-hugger trapped in a room (and I could relate to it since I'm scared when I suspect a cockroach in a bathroom), we had flamethrowers and grenades and acid flushing all over faces, a race against the clock, but the ending fight is just the Chantilly on the cherry on the cake.To be honest, I initially thought the last hour was so intense it was like an overdose of adrenalin, and I was pleasantly surprised to see Ebert sharing the same view. I saw it again, and I was amazed that this was made with no CGI, that the story was riveting and the characters appealing. I said 'Alien' was a masterpiece of suspense while the sequel was a great action movie, in fact, 'Aliens' might be the ultimate action movie and a masterpiece of suspense as well, earning seven Academy Awards, including a surprising nomination for Sigourney Weaver. Unlike the first two 'Terminator' movies, the film didn't join 'Alien' in the Thrills list, but Ripley was also named eighth heroine in AFI's Top 50, not bad for a sequel... but even 'sequel' is too feeble a word to describe how powerful 'Aliens' is.To think that all Cameron had to do was adding an 'S' to get a classic makes it even more legendary.All it took was adding an 'S'...",10,4,8,12 November 2018
Dallas Buyers Club," Doctors said he had only thirty days to live, but what do they know?
","2013 had its share of real-life stories from the over-flashy and needlessly indigestible 'American Hustle' to Scorsese's very-entertaining-but-no-'Goodfellas' 'Wolf of Wall Street' and the respectable but polarizing '12 Years: A Slave'. Here you have one biopic that could have easily fallen in the trap of sentimentalism or blind militancy but didn't, because the director Jean-Marc Vallee knew this was the sort of story to make half the film and needs nothing but honest storytelling, straightforward directing and great acting.'Dallas Buyers Club' tells the story of Ron Woodroof, a rodeo player, sleazy, coke and sex-addict and homophobic redneck, not a nice guy at all. Karma will play a dirty trick when a doctor diagnoses him with the HIV virus and doesn't give him more than thirty days to live, but Ron will not only contradict the prognostic but will live long enough to fight the pharmaceutical industry and provide AIDS-patients the medicine they really need. It's a long crusade against the major companies who test the effect of a drug named AZT, supposed to cure some cancer-like AIDS effects. Ron, who bribes a hospital worker to get AZT, discovers that the medicine only makes people survive for a short amount of time while the right doses of very specific drugs (vitamins and peptides) can make them live. The drugs are available in Mexico and other countries but they're still frowned upon in the United States. That's the situation.This is not just a fight for health, but for the freedom to chose the way you want to cure yourself. Ron doesn't see himself as a crusader, he's just a man who acts and moves forward, he doesn't give a damn about what doctors said, he's practical, if a cocktail of drugs made him live long enough to survive the prognostic, he must blow the whistle and make the other patients know, the rest is only judicial matters and he can handle it. So, he opens his own business and sells drugs he manages to smuggle in exchange of a 400-dollar membership in the 'Dallas Buyers Club'. As time moves on, the membership implodes and proves the efficiency of the new treatment, to the point that his first treating physician, played by Jennifer Garner, questions the ethics of the pharmaceutical lobbies' methods.What makes 'Dallas Buyers Club' such a great story is that it never ceases to stop delivering information, it is a real enlightenment about the first years of AIDS and how it started to spread and be only perceived as a gay or junky disease, and what better way to show it from the perspective of a man who starts as homophobic. There's something of a poetic irony that Ron suffers the same rejection and, no pun intended, gets a taste of his own medicine. What we witness in the first and second act is a brilliant metamorphosis of an individual from a sleazy macho man act to a human being who over steps the bounds of discrimination and understands that the same way, viruses don't make differences, no person should. He changes and for the better. That's the stuff great stories are made of. It's not just about health but about dignity.And even with such a premise, 'Dallas Buyers Club' could have been a cheap emotional underdog story, but you never really see the transition because all through the film, this is Ron acting as a militant, smuggling, phoning, bribing, lying, disguising himself, confronting the doctors, the cops, the FDA, only near the end, you can see the metamorphosis. And the key to Ron's transformation is the character of Rayon, a young transsexual who's rejected at first, but eventually inspires Ron one of his first powerful reactions to homophobia. Any other film would've made It too preachy and obvious but here, it works because it's just plays it straightforwardly, without any hint of a possible agenda. It is about people.And Matthew McConaughey delivers the performance of a lifetime as a man who wouldn't take crap from anybody because he's moved by the most basic human instincts: rage and survival. When he learns about the news, Ron goes through the five emotional stages of grief, he's in denial first, but then gets angry because he understand he screwed his life by having unprotected sex, he's scared and started with bargain, but then he's not resigned in the sense that he accepts his death, he's enraged because he knows people can at least live with the cure but aren't given the proper medication. Ron wants to live, he wants his friends to survive too, so nothing can stand between this thirst for living and his struggle, only AIDS can defeat him and he knows any month earned is a victory, and there's no defeat because it is not a fight to be ever over.Watching 'Dallars Buyers Club', I couldn't help but feel deeply attached to the protagonists, their sadness and anger, and I was shocked to see industrial big shots depriving people from their basic freedom. I don't expect everything to be 100% accurate but I want to believe it because I know humanity can be that cruel and cynical, and sometimes, the sleaziest persons can reveal themselves in such extreme situation. As sad as AIDS was for Ron, it made him a better man than he could ever lived had he not been HIV positive. It was a destiny and a magnificent one. 'Dallas Buyers Club' is a powerful drama, served by spectacular performances and a great reminder of the suffering caused by AIDS on a psychological level, it even hit a personal chord because I had my share of worries and I will never forget how tasty the air felt when I was told that my test was negative.",10,2,2,31 December 2016
The Exorcist," Simply, the greatest 'Horror' film ever made ...
","What scares us more than anything? The answers are multiple : the dark, the evil, a mysterious presence, death ultimately; in fact, anything incontrollable. And when you think about it, all these elements have something in common: they refer to an unknown force whose presence is palpable. Indeed, the unknown scares, because it can't be seen, can't be controlled, therefore, can't be fought.These are the primitives fears that tortured the life of people since the dawn of humanity, and we inherited this fears in the same unconscious way our children will. We're aware of our mortal nature, and each of our fears is driven by this awareness, which is due to the biggest fear, the fear of the unknown. And the genius of 'The Exorcist' is that it perfectly plays on these primitive instincts of ours, to provide the greatest Horror film ever made, a thrilling masterpiece of realism that'll haunt cinematic memories for ever. As soon as the Tubular bells start ringing, the film is inhabited by an atmosphere that will never desert it, a fearsome and gloomy ambiance absorbing any place we're watching the film in. Everything is directed with such confidence and meticulousness, the thrills almost come precociously. Indeed, before anything happens, we feel something WILL happen, but we don't know what. It seems like a cinematic trick, but not any director has the guts to let you wait more than almost half an hour before the oddities happen. The set-up is slow paced in 'The Exorcist' because it's a movie that respects our intelligence, and doesn't try to provide cheap thrills. William Friedkin who had just made another realistic masterpiece, the Best Picture Winner 'The French Connection' is so confident he gives us enough time to discover the characters, to get into their daily life, patiently waiting for the pivotal point that will join their fates. The direction, the writing are all in subtlety, and work because even though nothing happens yet, we keep our guard up, we know there's an evil presence somewhere, we can feel it.This is an old cinematic device started by directors who hadn't enough money to portray credible monster-type villains: they understood that sometimes, the scare is more efficient from the suggestion of a presence than its explicit depiction. When you see, you know, and if you know, you can control, but in 'The Exorcist', the villain is here, but we never see him, he's like the shark from 'Jaws' or 'Alien', with a slight difference, he's not visible because he controls the body of a poor little girl. Linda Blair, as the demonically possessed Regan MacNeil , is so convincing, it broke my heart to see how the evil can have so devastating effects on a pure little soul. And the tragedy of Regan is the torment of her mother, Chris, Ellen Burstyn, perfect as a totally helpless woman, incapable of saving her little girl. And this is the fascinating aspect of the film, more than a horror drama, it also works as a thrilling mystery. A mystery where the Lieutenant Detective Kinderman, Lee J. Cobb in one of his great last roles, is the one who investigates about the strange phenomena that occurred and acts as a bridge between the victims and the priests.So many questions are raised in the beginning, we understand that sooner or later, we'll have an exorcism. Well, it's the title, isn't it? But the set-up is necessary. The parallel stories where we're transported into the universes of Father Damien Karras, portrayed by Jason Miller, and the iconic Father Merryl, Max Von Sydow, challenge our patience: we can't wait for the exorcism ... but without the build-up, the climax would be worthless. It's a movie where any flaws can be caused by an impatience from the director, an eagerness to distract the masses with thrilling moments, but a big impatience could have ruined such a magnificent and ambitious project. And 'The Exorcist' would never have been the masterpiece it is without this patience. However, this would never have been such an iconic horror masterpiece without the few horrifying moments that punctuate the movie between the set-up and the climax. And by horrifying, I won't give any clues, let's just say it works on every level: visual, sounds, atmosphere, cinematography, dialogs, special effects, and of course, timing, since all these effects come at the least expected moments, provoking reactions in total symbiosis with the characters. We feel and fear for them, as the realism implies that it could even happen to us. This is no Hollywood, this is true horror.Lately, the American Film institute listed the Top 100 movies and I must admit I was shocked not to see 'The Exorcist' in the list... it's a classic, probably the most horrifying horror film ever made. It has everything, a dazzling cinematography incarnated by the iconic shot of Father Merryl's shadowy silhouette coming from the mist, an unforgettable villain, and of course shocking moments where the make-up, the visual and sound effects prove how vital they are for such a genre that relies so much on realism. But this realism would have been nothing without the genius of the script and the masterful direction, that could finally let the film exude all its greatness in the last act, one of the most unforgettable climactic sequences ever, putting 'The Exorcist' among those films that transcends the simple act of watching, becoming more of experiences.And this is why I waited for years and years before finally getting to watch 'The Exorcist', one of the few movies that scared me even before watching it. And all I can say is that it met my expectations. And watching it at night (with someone, I would recommend) gets more hypnotic and absorbing after each viewing  'The Exorcist' is a must-see and ... be careful, any second, it can surprise you, really",10,19,24,27 March 2011
Gandhi," The triumph of a little man ... an inspiration for humanity ...
","Albert Einstein said about Gandhi : 'Generations to come will scarce believe that such a one as this walked the earth in flesh and blood'.Well, I believe a soul so generous in goodness and capable of intelligent humility ever graced the face of the Earth and enriched our universal History's heritage, I sincerely do. But I can't admit that the last thing this great soul saw, was the face of hatred and violence, as the cruelly tragic destiny of a soul that was definitely too simply noble for our 'sophisticated' comprehension of what is right or wrong. Maybe that's what Einstein meant : Gandhi, was good on a superhuman level.But that raises a puzzling issue regarding the Mahatma's posthumous aura. A man with his magnitude sure deserves to be venerated and honored by people from all over the world. However, this contradicts the conception that Gandhi had on his own person for he never felt like being special or above anybody, not even the untouchables. Cleaning the latrines was no less honorable than being an accountant and Gandhi rejected whatever would betray his background or social category in order to banish himself from premises of comfort and luxury and make one with his people. Gandhi's ascension to power ironically coincided with an extraordinary descent into the lowest depths of Indian population, at a time where 350 millions of Indians needed the light to guide them to the Independence.Richard Attenbough's Best Picture Winner could have been one of these epics that are more excuses to display cinematic grandeur with scenes of battles, inflamed speeches and cheerful cries, but the movie elevated itself from such clichés by centering the story on the man, more than the cause, making the cause no less inspiring. The psychological dimension of the Oscar winning script invites us to follow the birth of Gandhi's political conscience in South Africa and its evolution when he would rediscover his country, struck by poverty, and the shocking injustices of the British domination. Realizing that the education of Indian elites lead to an unfortunate ignorance of the real people's basic needs, Gandhi never left the ashram (community) and progressively became the iconic figure we're all familiar with, reassembling more and more disciples and followers, among them the Pandit Nehru and Mirabehn, a British woman who devoted her life for Gandhi, intriguing the skeptical Muslim leader Mohamed Jinnah and even the British enemy, but never without some unconscious fascination.'Gandhi', as any epic, doesn't lack action and thrills, but they only serve as elements that will drive Gandhi's political beliefs or influence his decisions. Gandhi's determination and defiance toward the British will clearly be reinforced after the infamous Amritsar massacre, one of the most poignant and heart-breaking parts of the film. Most of the times, we're invited to meditate on Gandhi's thoughts, and on that level, the movie has a very interesting intellectual value, changing the image of pacifist that marked the card of Gandhi. In a simple but insightful scene, Gandhi, still a young lawyer, explains to a priest his view on 'turning the left cheek' as a self-defense move. For Gandhi, it's a sign of courage and resistance more powerful than the basic use of violence, and the active non-resistance revealed itself to be crucial in the extreme circumstances when violence was expected by the British as an alibi to justify their repression.In fact, the attitude preached by Gandhi is more provocative than any act of violence or terror. And when you extrapolate this idea to our current world, you realize how visionary was Gandhi. Not to say that violence was never necessary, but have the leaders who conquered the power through violence got rid of that deadly instinct? Gandhi knew it and foresaw great tragedies. 'An eye for an eye will make the whole world blind' A sad prediction illustrated by the civil war that torn India apart. The late scenes provided some early hints of why a man like Gandhi would be killed by his own people. It's easier to set the fire of hatred and violence but it takes a greater deal of courage to extinguish it. Gandhi firmly believed in the coexistence between the Hindus and Muslim, and the worst that could've happened was the dislocation of the territory. I was particularly moved by the Civil War sequence, not just for the historical tragedy it represented, but because it illustrated that the cause Gandhi dedicated his whole life for, was being annihilated. I was sorry for Gandhi more than anyone, how ironic that the massacred also ceased for the sake of Gandhi.As usual, the movie absorbs you in its most serene moments. When the war stops, all of Gandhi's friends, surround his frail body begging him to stop his hunger strike. Gandhi often punished himself as if he felt responsible for his people, 'Bapu' was his nickname as he was the Nation's father more than symbolically. In a significant scene, Gandhi advises an Indian, devoured by the guilt of having killed a Muslim boy as an act of revenge, to find a boy and raise him as a Muslim. This is basically, how Gandhi would have raised his people. Still, Gandhi was a man of simplicity, and perfectly embodying the spirit of the Mahatma, the simplest and quietest scenes were the best, especially those involving his tender and respectful relationship with his devoted wife Ba who, inspired by Gandhi's dedication, followed him heart and soul. Speaking of soul, Ben Kingsley's perfect performance was the soul of this film, which is not one of the most inspirational biopics but also a remarkable achievement on the field of cultural knowledge.The philosophical heritage of Gandhi speaks to the whole world, for any country, at any time, and his tragedy was that his voice still fails to be heard, as it did in his own country ... but his combat is still our inspiration.",10,2,5,28 August 2011
American History X," Starts as a thought-provoking commentary on Racism and ends as a simplistic Anti-racism propaganda ...
","Tony Kaye's 'American History X' intelligently tackles the subject of violence and racism and how this dangerous dichotomy is deeply rooted in the social injustices and everyday frustrations endured by American people regardless of their skin. But while it raises very thought-provoking interrogations, it fails to come back with meaningful answers.I concede that the film was brave enough to have a very unsympathetic character as the lead, Edward Norton is brilliant as Derek Vinyard, a young ideologically disoriented man whose level of hatred and violence is defined by his aptitude to kill and a huge chest-tattooed swastika, and the film was even braver to try to depict his 'moral salvation'. But the film's problem is that both his downfall and his redemption are not treated with the same level of intelligence. I couldn't buy it would take only one rape by a gang of Nazi prisoners and a subplot involving the friendship with a black guy working in the laundry, to redeem Derek. How could the movie be so indulgent toward his racism by reducing it to a sickness whose only remedy was 'to see the light'? If David McKenna's script had the guts to depict one of the most disturbing and shocking (realistic) deaths: the curb-stomping, how did he expect to make a nice guy out of such a despicable character in less than two hours? It took more than three for Spike Lee to make us root for 'Malcolm X' and he wasn't as cold-blooded and merciless as Derek Vinyard. Intelligence and fast-paced editing are not the most compatible elements for such provocative and promising character studies. Unfortunately, the whole deconstruction of Derek's personality fallaciously shows him more as a victim of racism than the true and condemnable perpetrator of racist acts. And this is a dangerous intellectual shortcut contradicting the idea that we're all determined by acts committed in a responsible way.And Derek sure the hell knew what he was doing as a skinhead leader, yet the film shows him as a good kid with a good heart who let himself absorbed by racial prejudices as soon as his father was killed by black people... and the movie pretends to display a crucial plot twist through one scene where the prejudices of Derek's father foreshadows his descent into racism. The black-and-white choice for the flash-back sequences is ironically fitting because it features the two sides of Derek Vinyard, when he's too bright for his entourage or too violent, in-between, there's an absence that would have probably provided the right answers, or at least, some hints.Take for instance the dinner table scene, probably the most gripping and morally challenging of the film : Derek exposes his views with such confidence that we're tempted to root for the core of his ideas (cleared of course from their blatantly racist overtones). At one moment, Elliot Gould, playing a Jewish professor, even speaks about the persecution of Jews with an irrelevance that almost justifies Derek's point about people from any communities raising the 'Antiracism' flag every time they feel offended in order to avoid self-criticism, blocking any attempt of rational discussion. And then, all of a sudden, as to destroy all the interrogations the scene just constructed, Derek acts like a one-dimensional evil thug, concluding in an anti-Semitic rant against Gould, proudly showing his tattoo.So Derek is not racist with a heart full of anger whose seeds was planted in the field of 'legitimate' frustration, he's just a bright kid who used his charisma and rhetoric to be the spokesman of a Neo-Nazi group. 'American History X' evokes the manipulative effect of racist theories ignoring that it uses the same rhetoric tricks as the anti-racism : when you can't reply by constructive words, just be offended, and it's made easier when Derek is the offender. I really want to quote Gould asking Derek 'What are you trying to prove?' That racism is only the way some people choose to ignore their own responsibilities and point their fingers on other communities? That's fine except that this is how anti-racism works too and the whole film is also guilty for having portrayed Derek as a victim of unfortunate circumstances.Should we be indulgent because he lost his father? Should we consider that he got the lesson just because he was anal-raped by the Nazi-men in jail? Are we supposed to believe that the Hispanic or Black prisoners are such gentleman that they decided to give a break to Derek?? What's with the idolization of Hitler by Daniel Vinyard, Edward Furlong as Derek's younger brother? Only a consequence of his admiration for his older brother? So all it would take to fix it is a sweet debriefing from his brother, and a history paper course with a cool-sounding title. The movie is so judgmental toward 'racism' that it should have the decency to depict the limits of blind and institutionalized anti-racist lobbying; then it would have really been ahead of its time.And the ending was another example of a manipulative getaway, the dark tunnel with the light of hope, Daniel gets killed by the very black kid he provoked the day before  symbolically, I would have accepted this death as a tragic eye-for-an-eye response to the curb-stomping, but then I'd like to know –and sorry to insist on a technical aspect- why the director didn't shoot that scene again because I'm sorry, Edward Norton, one of the greatest actors of his generation, wasn't convincing. I even spotted some embarrassing moments where he looked like smiling, and that wouldn't have deserved an Oscar.While it was asking for an unconventional social commentary, with the same intellectual courage as Spike Lee's 'Do The Right Thing' or 'Malcolm X', this 'X' falls in the politically correct trap that inevitably patronizes us through its subliminal 'Racism is bad' message, and the movie didn't deserve that, not after such a promising start anyway.",7,0,2,11 November 2011
Spirited Away," Dorothy , Pinocchio, Alice and finally... Chihiro!
","'Spirited Away' ventures in the realm of poetic fantasy through the life-changing journey of Chihiro, a ten-year old girl imprisoned in a world of spirits after her parents have been turned into pigs.This premise suggests a mixture of two universal stories immortalized (but not created) by Disney: 'Pinocchio' and 'Alice in Wonderland'. The parents become pigs after they surrendered to gluttony in an unattended restaurant full of appetizing meals; the father mentions his credit card before swallowing a large spoonful of noodles like a pig, literally. Both adults are punished like the kids in Dream Island who made jackasses of themselves. Chihiro was spared because she felt something was wrong and only wanted (a bit cowardly) to get back to the car.There's a sort of 'immanent justice' governing this seemingly hostile universe, any action has either a cost or a reward, established by the wizard-like imagination of Hayao Miyazaki. Take the villainous Yubaba, a big-headed 'witch' who's also the tenant of a traditional bathhouse and the one who cursed Chihiro's parents, despite her evil ordeals, she's not as one-dimensional as the Coachman, she's a manager who believes in good work and good manners. She's as capable as complimenting and rewarding as she is in the 'punishing' department. It all comes to a moment halfway through the film, when you see the parent's punishment as a severe yet understandable answer to their lack of humility. But just because Chihiro didn't yield the temptation doesn't make her immune to the wrath of Yubaba. Chihiro wasn't too enthusiastic about the family moving to another town, she missed her friends and school, she's literally turned to the past, like an overprotected only child who can't get off her zone of comfort. After 'Pinocchio', she's also a little Alice who doesn't dream about escapism but quite the opposite, and although she doesn't become a pig, her presence in that world has a reason, Chihiro is a girl who embraces the present and only wishes to have her parents back, but she has a few lessons to learn, not to redeem her parent's fault but to overcome her status-quo complex and the things she take for granted.Chihiro works as a slave for Yubaba, giving her name in exchange of safety. It's not exactly the name, but from what I gathered, a 'kenji', a sort of syllabus that changes her identity to Sen. Actually, the literal meaning of the Japanese title is the 'Disappearance of Sen and Chihiro' as if Chihiro was incarnating the loss of Japanese memory, like her parents did when they forgot about basic courtesy in the name of money or like these human ghosts in that masterful train sequence, probable metaphors of Japanese people alienated by the modern world. By becoming two persons at once, Chihiro embarks on a transitional state, in a quest she knows nothing about, and neither do we, until the end, when the film unveils the message, like 'The Wizard of Oz' did with the unforgettable 'there's no place like home'.Now, at that point of the review, I'll keep this simple and say that 'Spirited Away' is also a visually rich experience full of Carrolian elements, such as animal-creatures and food with shape-changing power. It is populated by a vast gallery of characters, humans, toad-looking creatures, a boy named Haku who knows Chihiro's name but suffers from existential amnesia as well, there's also a spider-human hybrid working in the boiler room, helped by minuscule black minions (the closest to comic reliefs in the film). Miyazaki drained his imagination from Japanese folklore but he creates his worlds with an instinct in detail and harmony in the drawings that would make any foreigner feel 'at home'. Some elements will certainly be lost in translation, but it's like Kurosawa's movies, the core is universal.The clear line that became the trademark of the anime elevates the animation to the level of a noble art, one that creates realities of its own, or worlds that speak to our own perception of reality. And using his poetry and his delicate artistry, Miyazaki reprises the same themes than in 'Mononeke' with a few variations: the former was about the battle between men and nature but this time, it's about the inner battle, causing men to disrespect the environment, forget about their identity and embrace life like money-driven robots or faceless ghosts. And it's not much that the film is about this stuff but the way it is. The effect on environment is demonstrated through a wonderful sequence involving the washing of a putrid creature, and the lure of gain is conveyed by the 'No Face' character who gets anything he wants in exchange of gold nuggets.Things get easily out of control, until Chihiro refuses the gold nuggets because she didn't need them. All she wanted was to save her parents. As the movie progresses, you can fell the change going on, she's not the shy little girl who couldn't even climb down stairs, she became strong, mature, confidently walking on a very tight metal pipe, symbolically coming to age after a harrowing journey. A tale about modernity set in a traditional Japanese setting, 'Spirited Away' belongs to that breed movies that embrace weirdness with such majestic confidence we can't feel more deceived when we get back to our flat and boring reality, speaking for myself, after watching two 'Miazaki' in a row, I feel instinctively bored just thinking of the 'regular' animated movies.",10,1,1,26 June 2017
Jackie," Behind every great man, there's a woman... that's not to say she'll always have to stay behind...
","If you asked anyone about the most influential First Ladies, the likelihood that the Top three includes Eleanor Roosevelt, Jackie Kennedy and Hillary Clinton will be fairly strong. But isn't it odd that Jackie was the only one not to be a preeminent political figure? That she stayed only 1000 days in the White House and was mostly remembered for her youth, good looks and taste for fashion? But it's misunderstanding the power of fate to believe it takes historically significant achievements to achieve historical significance. So, on a sunny day of November 1963, Jackie made the acquaintance with destiny when a bullet did the same with her husband's skull.Pable Larrain's 'Jackie' is an intimate portrait showing JFK's assassination from Jackie's standpoint and the aftermath from her perspective. It is a short time-line but enough to measure the greatness this frail and delicate woman could reach. Indeed, the film belongs to that category of intelligent biography pictures that don't go all 'once upon a time' but choose the right period to emphasize the emotional struggles of their protagonists, like Diana's funeral in 'The Queen' or Nixon's interview in 'Frost/Nixon'. Not all the biography movies need the time spans of 'Gandhi' and 'Lawrence of Arabia', so Larrain doesn't care much about Jackeline Bouvier or Jackie Onassis, this is the story of Mrs. Kennedy and how she went from that brunette concerned about showing her most dashing smile during the televised White House tour in 1962 to the confident woman who helped American people to get through their most difficult mourning time.But 'Jackie' can't do without a few flashbacks, so thanks to a clever editing (although sometimes a little awkward), the film is told in flashback through the infamous interview from Life Magazine one week after the assassination and conducted by a journalist played by Billy Crudup. The interview allows to swing back and forth in a rather elastic time-line and it raises the immediate awareness that this film, of bland and austere look, will be enhanced by the flashy performance of Natalie Portman. Watching the first ten minutes of the film, I understand why her performance was deemed Oscar-worthy right at the release. I had my reservations because she doesn't exactly look like Jackie and being four inches shorter added to her physical vulnerability, but when she's in close-ups and she asserts her doubts and her certitudes, when she shares her pain or sweeps all the rumors and falsehoods with chain-smoking confidence, she's believable.As Jackie, there are even some 'Black Swan' vibes exuding from the performance as if Portman had an unconscious predisposition for dual and complex personas. And by juxtaposing scenes that take place before, during and after the assassination, you can see the evolution of Jackie without any obligatory narrative-serving transition. First, she's that timid woman with an catching smile, her youth and beauty doing the rest of the job. The day of the assassination, she's in a state of mental confusion, realizing that everyone is already in post-Kennedy mood, obviously Johnson and his wife have other things in mind than the funeral protocol and the only support Jackie can find is from Bobby (played by Peter Saargard). The emotional state of Jackie is conveyed by the very particular score of Mica Levy, which I would qualify as hit-or-miss, the kind to either adore or hate. It didn't bother me, but I don't really get what the fuss is all about.But I loved every minute of the film when it dealt with Jackie's existential crisis, driven by her husband's terminated existence. The truth is that she never really measured his stature as a leader until he was killed, JFK entered history through his death, and then Jackie probably realized that like Lincoln, or in a lesser measure, McKinley and Garfield, his historical magnitude had deepened and it was her task to befit this greatness she felt like the only one to perceive. And the value of the movie is to show how hasty the funerals were to be, had it not be for Jackie's involvement. And as the process evolves, you can also feel the evolution and the gain in confidence that also transcended her all-smiling aura. The shocked woman with the pink outfit became a solemn, dignified, black-clad widow and mother aware of her responsibilities, among them, transitioning her husband to his new historical status... and herself in the process (albeit, involuntarily).Larrain's film is less a biopic than a character study and through this portrait of Jackie Kennedy, we realize that sometimes, a shock can build a person. When it comes to history, what kills you can make you more iconic, that's for JFK, but what didn't kill Jackie made her enter history, by contributing to her husband's sanctification. One of the film's leitmotifs is a song JFK used to love, named 'Camelot' a hymn about the loss and the exhilaration of great achievements. Not that I suspect this was the indirect commentary on our era 'Jackie' tried to make, nor that there is a point in discussing the accuracy related events since most of the elements of the movie seem to be plausible and the performance of Natalie Portman makes the film all worth to watch.There are also very captivating dialogues, especially with the late John Hurt, delivering one of his last performances as the priest who'll give a few hints to Jackie about the impenetrable ways of God. The heavy omen incarnated by his frail and declining health gives one disturbing but emotional edge to 'Jackie'. I only wish the film wouldn't have eliminated the one scene I waited for: John John saluting his Dad's coffin, that could have been a real emotional pinnacle, but it seems that the focus on Jackie confined to obsession and developing peripheral characters could have highlighted her personality in a more objective, then efficient, way. Still, within its modest budget and short run-time, this was a captivating movie.",8,1,3,9 February 2017
Duck You Sucker," Viva la Revolucion ... not ...
","'Duck, you sucker!' shouts a charming and friendly James Coburn to Rod Steiger after he's just planted a baton of dynamite in his wagon. In other words, get ready for a big 'bang' and protect yourself. The line is repeated so many times it became the film's running gag, a catchphrase so to speak, in fact, the film's title, translated from the Italian 'Giu la Testa' : 'Bow your head'.Yet the title doesn't quite work. There's something cheap, familiar, not worthy of a film in the same vein than the 'Dollars' trilogy and 'Once Upon a Time in the West'. An odd choice indeed for a movie that opens with a warning about the meaning of revolution, something that made me want to tell today's youth, notably in Arab countries 'hear, hear'. Revolution isn't a social dinner, it isn't made of elegance and courtesy, it's brutal, bloody and innocent people get killed for it.And anyone with a brain can start it but once it starts, no one can predict its outcome, much more whether the new order will be better or worse than the previous. The only certainty in Revolution is that the wealthy survives, and people are the suckers. These Libyans or Egyptians who were so eager to throw the power out, what did they win? Are they in a better situation? Sergio Leone, a man of vision, witnessing the revolutionary waves that shook Europe in the late 60's and Italy was no exception, and couldn't see past the violence, the bloodshed and terrorism.This is not to say that the Maestro didn't have a political conscience, 'Once Upon a Time in the West' spoke powerful statements about the end of the western myth where modest entrepreneurs were sacrificed on the altar of progress and civilization, when capitalism killed the frontier spirit. The opening of 'Duck you Sucker' works like a powerful continuation, Juan, a Mexican vagrant, urinates on a rock full of ants, an animalistic metaphor reminding of Sam Peckinpah's masterpiece 'Wild Bunch' where kids were feeding red ants with a poor scorpion.Juan pees on the ants, like the passengers of the stage he'll get in, pee on the insects peasants are. Distinguished bourgeois and aristocrats treat peasants with the same contempt and condescension's while Juan acts dumb to comfort their opinions, before fooling them. They get carjacked, their clothes stolen and left naked with nothing. This act seals a brief victory of peasants but don't get yourself fooled, this isn't a victory of classes, this is not 'Viva Zapata!', it's pure and simply taking money, wealthy people are loved for their money more than hated for their attitude. And Juan is not interested in politics.On the same day, an oddity passes through him and his family, a man riding a motorcycle, an easy rider in the real meaning of the word. His face is friendly and smiling, his name is Sean, or John, the English version of Juan, this is how predestined to meet the two men were. Sean is an expert of dynamite but he's not interested in politics not anymore. Juan doesn't care, he needs his skills to open the safe of Mera Verde's bank. Both men feel different, Sean is classy and stoic, Juan is extroverted and hot-tempered but both have one thing in common, they have no faith in revolution.Yet Sean has a reason, he used to believe, he was an IRA agent, but he was betrayed by his closest friend, as the film progresses, the many flashbacks punctuating the action reveal more and more about Sean, his life in Ireland, and a special triangular relationship, these parts are conveyed by one of Ennio Morricone's most emotional themes, something that resonates as a powerful eulogy to a past drown in an ocean of nostalgic tears and the ashes of a faith that will never recover. Sean doesn't believe in revolution, because it's men's work, and men ought to betray. Facts will prove him right. Juan believes revolution is lead by men who can read telling those who can't to fight. The character of Romano Valli proves him right.If anything, Sean incarnates the second title given to the film 'A Fistful of Dynamites', something that conveys the same catchiness than an Eastwood film, Eastwood who refused to reprise his iconic role, rightfully letting Coburn's contagious smile illuminating the screen and making one with Rod Steiger who took Eli Wallach's place. Steiger's character suggests the idea of 'Duck you Sucker', 'bow your head, you peasant, you're the one who'll get screwed at the end'. And the film is full of some of the most brutal massacres and scenes of execution including a heart-wrenching one where peasants get casually massacred on trenched like cattle., where a whole family can be killed. This is ugliness after idealism. So much for the chants.The whole irony of the film is that the most disillusioned men about revolution, the most eager to go to America, after having nothing to lose, will be the most helpful to the cause, somewhat because deep in themselves they have courage, they have strength, and they are part of a vanishing breed, men who follow their instincts. And this is what Leone movies are about, men who act, who help themselves, who save, they're disillusioned but they'll give the meaning their life deserve.And together, Coburn and Steiger will write one of the most underrated Western stories, one whose only fitting title, was 'Once Upon a Time the Revolution' forever incarnated in my mind by these irritating 'Sean, Sean' as irritating than a past obsessively haunting your past, like Harmonica's tragedy, like Noodle's phone call, Coburn in his greatest role, is a man haunted by a past helping to build the future of man who lost his.And isn't the revolution, a way of killing the past for a better future?",8,1,2,30 December 2014
Underground," Comrades, Join the ... Party ... Opaaaaaaa !
","'Underground' is an epic tale of absurdity directed by Emir Kusturica using the tragedy of his motherland, who used to be called Yugoslavia, as the backdrop of the film. The history of this country can be compared to a deep wound that still can't be healed up. The land has been tortured, invaded, raped in her soul by the circumstances of History, it's still bleeding yet people never stopped to sing, to dance, to love, to believe in a brighter future. Such a personal story, so deeply rooted in Kusturica's heart, could have been told in a sad, dark and quite depressing tone, but a sad movie, 'Underground' is not. And a hilarious imaginative poignant comedy, it sure is. Emir Kusturica's Golden Palm Winner is a masterpiece of flamboyance, of decadence and non-stop dance ... a never-ending party that revisits the tragedy of History and translates it into an epic, romantic and frenetic comedy, so damn entertaining these isn't a single moment I didn't want to get up on the table and start to dance with a glass on my hand, to Goran Bergovic's incredible soundtrack. Indeed, this film is full of music, of energy, of emotions and transports us into a fantastic journey in the tragic History of Yugoslavia, following a chronological road : World War II, the Cold War and of course, the Modern War. This final act is depicted in a darker tone, to highlight the loss of every thing that made Yugoslavia, a land of hope, of optimism and fraternity. But, never letting war and death pushing our mood down, Kusturica ends the film in an apotheosis. A great finale for a great movie about life and hope, to keep a great smile in your face until the end ... which the film doesn't have, because there's less optimism with an ending than with the belief of a rebirth after the mutilation of a never-ending war.But 'Underground' isn't a documentary about this war, or about Yugoslavia. Basically, it's the story of a love triangle and an evil scheme. It starts with two men, two friends : Marko, the sympathetic opportunistic intellectual and his best friend Blacky who's just joined the Party, Blacky is an electrician, a lovable naive buffoon with a warm heart and a head made of stone. Marko and Blacky are both members of the Communist Party and resistant fighters after the partial destruction of the country by the German invasion. Those men love to drink, to dance, and more than that, they love the same woman : the actress Natalja. Natalja is a young, pretty, ambitious woman with many lovers, a Nazi officer, Blacky, her future husband and Marko her future lover. They're all flawed, exuberant, yet always sympathetic. But the lyric soul of the film is Yvan, Marko's brother, an innocent zoo guardian with a stammer and who developed a strange relationship with a monkey, Soni. He loves his brother, he's sweet and tender, and maybe he believes in animals more than men whose cruelty touched him deep in the heart. He seems to be the only who cares for what happens and carries the tragedy in his pure heart.After liberating Blacky from the Germans, Marko hides him in the cave, 'underground', until the war stops ... Then Marko, who's been previously struck by Natalja's beauty will elaborate one of the most evil schemes ever plotted in film, just to keep her. He'll make all the population who lived, who were born and grew up in the cave, participate to the War Effort by making weapons for the Resistance ... even after the Liberation when the Allies achieved to destroy what the Germans left. Ivan, hidden in the cave, doesn't know the War is over. Blacky doesn't know the Iron Curtrain is drawn now and he's a dead legend above the ground. He doesn't even know that his best friend, is very close to Tito, and a respectable member of the Party, married to Natalja, an acclaimed actress.Natalja drowns her guilt and her loss of innocence in alcohol, she's weak but she's already been ... Natalja is a beautiful girl flirting with the enemy, married to a man, and having a love affair with another. She and Marko are both opportunistic, they understand each other. She can't hate him because he 'lies so well'. It's not her fault, she can't control her seductive power. Natalja is like an allegory of a beautiful country invaded numerous times during history, a country that doesn't know where her heart belongs anymore. Blacky and the poor victims of Comrade Marko lived in a cave during the Communism years, did they really miss more than those who lived above the ground ? The scheme is so evil Marko has an accomplice who found a trick to make time go slower, like life in an oppressive time make it seem slower. A diabolical absurd scheme, but no more or no less than the reality ... what better alibi for absurdity than war? Hot or Cold? War is ABSURD enough to inspire such acts ... The story is simply a fascinating metaphor of the more serious tragic fate of Kusturica's bruised motherland.But despite this sadness, the movie is about hope, joy and optimism ... these are the happiest and most cheerful people you'll see in a film, even during War, even when they fight, even in a cave, living years and years without seeing the sunlight, don't prevent them from amusement, dances, laughs, plays and everything that makes life worth to live ... the movie is a big Prison you never want to escape from. It's thrilling to watch, it's an optimistic tale for a tragic story ... you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll laugh and laugh and shout and fight and dance and have an extraordinary cinematic experience ....So, comrades, just have a glass and join the 'party' ... Opaaaaaaaa!",10,12,16,11 January 2011
The Usual Suspects," A Masterpiece of Manipulation ...
","Approaching 'The Usual Suspects' as a mystery thriller with an iconic ending disregards the real matter that cemented its greatness: the script. 'The Usual Suspects', more than any film, is a masterpiece of effective manipulation on which the final twist is only the icing on a rather delicious cake.I'm inclined to believe that most of the fans realized the magnitude of 'The Usual Suspects' on TV, VHS or DVD rather than in a movie theater. The movie has a fair share of thrills and action but is richer in terms of plot, subplots, and sub-subplots and demands more than one viewing. Although I catch one or two subtleties every once in a while, I think I got now 99% enough to consider myself a true fan of the film, and again, this is not just because of the finale.'The Usual Suspects' is like a modern 'Rashomon' in the way it plays back and forth with flashbacks through an interrogation between a police officer, David Kujan (Chazz Palminteri) and Roger 'Verbal' Kint (Kevin Spacey), a dim-witted cripple and the only survival of a harbor massacre. This is the mystery the movie opens with, as the game consists on finding out the 'why' and the 'how' lying beneath a bloody killing that killed everyone for 91 million dollars worth of an inexistent dope. And progressively, the mystery deviates to a more harrowing 'who' question, incarnated by the haunting presence of a criminal mastermind, named Keyser Soze, a human devil whose identity remains secret. The film puts us in Kujan's shoes, he who pretends to be the smarter, still, both Kujan and us, take Kint's words for granted until we're fooled by the shocking finale, but again, everything is in the build-up.The build up is why the comparison with 'Rashomon' takes its full significance. Kurosawa's masterpiece didn't just pave the way for non-linear narrative films, it was also revolutionary through the introduction of subjective narration, inviting us not to believe in everything we see from a character's point of view. Not that most of what Kint reveals is a lie, but what Kujan will believe won't be necessarily the truth. This is manipulation at its best, to make you believe something from your own thinking, by still respecting your intelligence. And this is the irony of the film, while we expect a twist, we're never discussing the veracity of what is said, it's like approaching the virtual core of the truth without never touching the inner verity. This is why the ending is literally spectacular; we're literally blinded by the unbearable truth's light. But this effect wouldn't have been the same if it wasn't for what preceded.As a reference to the iconic line from 'Casablanca', the usual suspects are five criminals joined in the famous line-up for a mysterious truck robbery. What strikes the most is that they are criminals of higher caliber, when in general; you've got one tough guy and just some bums put there as fillers. There were obviously lined up for another reason, a mission for Keyser Soze, the criminal whose reputation exceeds the limit of believability, a myth, a spook story? His absence is as chilling as his presence anyway. And there was absolutely no way for them to refuse, the tightly written script leaves no plot holes, only stuff left to interpretation, but for the rest, and every single detail, every line or look on a face, makes perfect sense. It's an elaborate puzzle where you can get the final image until the last piece and nothing can match the first time you experience the film, and not just the ending.And the greatness is that the build-up of Keyser Soze's character contributes to show him as man so evil, and so present, that his non-existence would be unacceptable if not implausible. He's here, and he's surely one of the usual suspects, and since we feel we're being tricked, we ought to think, maybe Keyser is Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne) or this Kobayashi lawyer (Pete Postelwhaite) or who the hell knows, maybe Kujan. It's not thrown in our face, we really try to believe this and when Kujan releases Kint, whatever the truth is, we feel like any coming twist must be both convincing and spectacular. Well, the wall board was probably one of the greatest cinematic revelations ever, getting us the final piece of the puzzle as we understand how Kint used the wall to insert some realistic details in his story. We got the final move of a psychological chess game, an extraordinary manipulation highlighted by the succession of quotes in voice-over in a masterstroke of sound editing sublimated by a perfect music and a revelation reaching its pinnacle on the sidewalk. Check-mate. When the movie ends, we realize what came before really needs a second viewing.And besides the writing and the editing, there are the little details you re-discover. When Kint is looking earlier at the wall, he looks dumbly detached but the second time you realize that he's building his story. When Kujan drinks coffee, you can see Kint glancing at the bottom of the mug, and you know how he got the Kobayahshi's name from. The details are also in these little something that made the movie so human, the hilarious line up is genuinely authentic, , it's not a movie with big-stars names, but the casting convey the feeling of underdog criminals with no small roles, hell, even Benicio Del Toro, who plays a minor character found the perfect note to make him memorable.Still, Kevin Spacey outperforms everyone as the character you stop looking at him the same way after each viewing. If not the greatest, he's certainly one of the most fascinating villains of cinema's history, whose shining moment is the last minute where in one look, he metamorphoses.Well, I guess the ending of the film is a big part of its greatness after all",10,1,2,24 August 2011
Inside Out," An Allegorical Masterpiece...
","I often dreamed about movies, but never BEFORE watching them. It happened with 'Inside Out', I had heard so many great things about it and the ubiquitous multi-colored posters were so eye-catchy, that the film was 'inside' my mind already, fittingly so, and now that I saw it, I can say that it will stay there... for a while.'Inside Out' is indeed the kind of movie that makes you want to emulate Amélie by turning around in the theater and see the smiling faces of the people around. I don't know for you, but after a few minutes, my eyes were literally glued to the screen, and from the expression on my face, you could tell that Joy's smile and optimism were irresistibly contagious.The entrance of Joy (Amy Poehler) and the genesis of the other emotion-related creatures in the mind of little Riley, echoed both my memories as a child and my current life as a little girl's daddy. Now, I look at her cries, her tantrums and the way she makes funny faces when told to behave herself in a whole different light. In less than five minutes, the film had already hit a sensitive chord, not that I doubt an animated film could achieve such a sentimental 'stunt', 'Mary and Max.' and 'Up' had also done a terrific job on that level.It's worth mentioning 'Up' because the two films hold a few similarities, beside being from the same director Pete Docter. Indeed, after tackling the loneliness of old age and the mourning of lost dreams, it's time for a brighter mindset, no pun intended. Riley is a preteen girl, still young enough to make monkey faces with Daddy, think of boys as playmates and sleep with soft toys, but she's old enough to react with maturity and empathy as her parents expect from their happy girl (in parent's language 'understanding') and all the emotions help Riley to face this critical time of her life, by pushing the right button (inside) at the right moment (out), literally.So, as the title suggests, the film is set in two worlds, the real world with Riley moving with her parents from Minnesota to San Francisco and the inside of her head, the 'headquarters' where emotions lead the show. The Chief Emotion is Joy, a blue-haired Tinkerbell-like creature with hair shaped like a star and radiating such an illuminated yellow she doesn't have a shadow. Joy looks at the bright side of life, and makes it a point of honor not to let Riley surrender to sadness the poor, short, rotund, bespectacled Sadness (Phyllis Smith) who can't push any button, and that doesn't do any good to her already low self-esteem.With a bossy emotion like Joy, Riley is a naturally happy girl, but as you would read in every 'Stay Positive' or 'Emotional Intelligence' book, each feeling has a reason to exist. Anger allows us to defend our integrity and fear is about self-preservation, sadness is a reaction to things we can't control and disgust, well disgust actually feels like a 'filler' because it doesn't have more reason to be there than, say, surprise or distrust. Never mind, the real outsider is Sadness. In other headquarters, thing go differently: the mother's chief emotion is Sadness and a mustached 'Anger' controls the father (by the way, I enjoyed these little glimpses on other headquarters, a nice touch for a film full of them).Now to the emotions, voiced by Lewis Black and based on his stand-up routines, Anger is a red fire brick dressed like a tired businessman, Fear is a purple raw nerve voiced by Bill Hader and Disgust is a broccoli-shaped fashion victim voiced by Mindy Kaling. Cinema is an Art of imagery and I don't think there's been a film as visually stunning without going for complex forms and settings; it's all in the colors, shapes and personalities. Emotions are people, memories are balls with the same color than their emotional value and Riley's mind is an enchanting Oz-like place, surrounded by Goofball, Family or Friendship Islands, where the core memories are 'stocked'.I was critical toward 'Inception' because the film had a similar concept but didn't have much to offer except for predictable CGI special effects. In 'Inside Out', emotions, dreams, imaginary friends, little things that define us, everything is materialized in a creatively allegorical way. This is escapism at its best and it didn't have to go as far as the Lost Falls. Recreating an entire world is the biggest challenge of animated cartoons, but 'Inside Out' created an entire new world and made its functioning coherent, easy to follow and scientifically viable in a weird way.But I make it sound like a technical achievement, the film also fulfills its premise in the storytelling department. By accidentally preventing Sadness from saddening a happy memory during the first day of school, both Joy and Sadness are expelled from the headquarters and get lost somewhere in the brain. They must get back, otherwise, Riley will only be controlled by anger, disgust and fear. And the oddest thing is that Riley's behavior still looks familiar from an outsider's perspective. Seriously, how many times we've met young kids behaving exactly like Riley?The film unexpectedly provides some interesting insights about kids' behavior and the way they repress positive emotions, to the point that even the 'negative' ones can't control them and make them capable of anything. Some parts are so intense they catch you off-guard, but they help to show the importance of emotions depending on the context. And during this unforgettable journey, Joy will also understand the power of sadness as a vehicle for happier emotions... no high spots without low ones.I start with smiles and I conclude with tears, because after all, this is still a Disney film, and paraphrasing the Master: for every laugh, there should be a tear. Hear, hear, Joy!",10,11,30,14 September 2016
The Duchess," The most underrated film of 2008 ...
","I've always appreciated movies set in the eighteenth century for their aesthetic value on the surface and in the content, for their depiction of a world disguising under a mask of elegant sophistication the hideous face of decadence. This kind of ambivalence is so appealing that the odds of me enjoying a period film are generally very high. And Saul Dibb's 'The Duchess' didn't disappoint me.I remember the first time I saw it in 2008, in a French movie theater during a very rainy day; I left up the place with delighted eyes and a broken heart. 'The Duchess' is a dazzling celebration of the weirdest and fascinating world of the eighteenth century's European aristocracy, through a lead, Georgiana Kavendish who, beyond her Duchess of Devonshire title was a real Queen of fashion, and the story manages to betray the very feeling provided by the art and costume design by depicting this world as a golden prison endured by the heroine, played by Keira Knightley in a performance that should have earned her an Oscar nomination.I still wonder why the film was overlooked by the Academy, except for a lousy art direction and costume design nomination (a deserved win) when the epic 'Benjamin Button' bore garnered much more accolades, I guess the film didn't have much more a drama except for the constant evolution in the relationship between the Duchess and the Duke of Devonshire. 'The Duchess' might have disappointed the aficionados of the genre who were waiting for suicide attempts, duels, war, anything but bloodshed! But sincerely, even this relative peacefulness is handled with the sincere poignancy of a Bergmanian character study minus the philosophical undertones.'The Duchess' never falls in the melodramatic trap because Georgiana is indeed a strong character. In the beginning, while she's playing with boys and girls of her age, her domineering personality leaves no doubts, she outshines everyone. Ironically, at the same time, she's seen through a window by her to-be husband, William, Duke of Devonshire, an affable ad quite-sinister looking Ralph Fiennes and the other girls all appear out of focus, literally. Georgiana's mother, Charlotte Rampling is praising both the physical and intellectual merits of her daughter, promising that she would be a credit to the Duke, as she already is to her, and we do believe her. The core of the story is foreshadowed when what preoccupies the Duke's mind the most is mentioned: having a son, the happiness of the couple would only rely on Georgiana's capability to give a son to the Duke, and history can be very capricious.'The Duchess' works on the Fiennes – Knightley total opposition, he's reserved with a seriousness so icy it confines to indifference, while she's elegant, flamboyant with a level of wit that matches her style. During a dinner, she admirably retorts to one politician's pompous rhetoric in one of these particular scenes full of ambiguity, especially when the Duke leaves the party, is he upset by her behavior? No, he simply doesn't fancy these displays of political smartness, he's a practical man, who enjoys the company of his dogs, manly pleasures and more than anything wants to have a son. 'The Duchess' would eventually overshadow her husband until he'd become the only one not in love with his wife, and the constant irony of 'The Duchess' is that her popularity would always stop in the walls of her own house.The tense relation with her husband made of hypocrisy, cheating, and sterile conventions, constitute the golden cage in which she's condemned. One of the merits of the film is to portray not just the hellish marital existence of a woman, but the constant need of love, of friendship consequent to that privation. The nuptial scene is a demonstration of how unaffectionate and careless of the Duchess' nervousness, and in a way, it represents her marriage lifestyle in microcosm, something that invites the Duchess to find other ways to compensate a cruel lack of affection, popularity, fashion, parties, politics, and a heart-warming friendship with Bess Foster, the woman who'd ultimately become her rival, she obviously has some appeal for the Duke, or is it because she had three sons? Ralph Fiennes beautifully portrays the antagonism, pushing the degree of vileness to historical standards that almost make him look vulnerable. Totally, incapable of having sons, his harshness is like the awkward demonstration of his own weakness.The film doesn't portray the Duke in a harsh way either, in one scene, he's having some time with Bess' sons, teaching the older on the way to use a gun. We feel sorry for a man who can't fulfill his own dreams and by extent, for a couple who seems miserable in its incomparable wealth, both imprisoned by a poisoned dream that never seem to happen. The script manages to detach itself from the 'having a boy' plot by exploiting the real core of the film, which is simply the need of love. When the Duchess lives her first moments of pleasure with Bess and when she makes love with her real lover, the scenes are graphic as to illustrate the real contrast with the nuptial scene. The Duchess feels that this world is capable of love after all. The film evolves into the crucial conflict between what is done in the name of love and in the name of those we love, two elements that sometimes doesn't match.The film works as beautiful display of real human relationships trapped in a world of conventions and obligations, even more pitiful that they could have been avoided. I wish I'd find something that the movie lacked or that could have justified its overlook by critics and Academy, but I can't  I for one, think it's one of the best of 2008.",9,0,1,18 January 2012
Die Hard 2," The right sequel : 'Die Hard 2', in the right place : an airport, at the right time : Christmas ...
","'You're the wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time', to which John McClane replies 'Story of my life' and he's damn right!'Die Hard 2' is the continuation of McTiernam's 1988's groundbreaking action masterpiece with quite an ambitious premise: being even more spectacular, suspenseful, violent and thrilling than the first. Well, since it couldn't have been as fresh as the irreplaceable 'Die Hard', it better had to succeed on the other departments. And it sure did ...Let's make a little calculation: how many innocent people died in 'Die Hard'? Well, there is the first Security Guard behind the desk who, let's face it, was doomed from the beginning, the second Security Guard, Nakatomi's General Manager Mr. Takagi, a shocking death but necessary plot-wise to convince us about Gruber's evilness and determination, and last but not least, there was Ellis who, like the two FBI Johnsons, had it coming. And after that, we could have a break  4 innocent people when it could have been ten times more, not the most disastrous body count on the 'good guys' side.Now, let's consider the second opus of the 'Die Hard' trilogy, Renny Harlin's 'Die Hard 2: Die Harder' (and $10,000.00 to whoever remembers the name of director). Now, there's about two hundred people dying in a plane crash, where you could hear some agonizing screams before a giant explosion. This was one hell of a gut-wrenching scene that immediately put the notion of 'mission succeeded' into perspective. But I guess, when the lives of thousands and thousands people are hanging by a thread, right there, in the air, one can consider it as a good score. Well, it's still for me hard to imagine that one director had the guts to kill off so many innocent people just like that. Yes, there were the first troop of cops, and that was quite disturbing, but it was part of their job. The 'Windsor' crash will remain one of the most disturbingly evil acts from an action film and the word is an understatement. But without it, 'Die Hard 2' would only have been a sort of 'Die Hard in an airport', while the crash makes you totally forget about the first opus, and John McClane's heart-breaking reaction makes the moment even more powerful.Sorry to occupy so many lines for what I consider the emotional highlight of the film, but this is the part that I always fear whenever I watch the film and I'll never forget how it haunted me the first time I saw it. After that, I couldn't get the evilness of the antagonist Colonel Sadler off my mind, he's probably one of the most underrated villains, especially because his actions were not even inspired by greed, Sadler was the quintessential terrorist, in his exploitation of fear and sheer terror for political reasons. I don't even think I'm reading too much, because 'Die Hard 2' has a great capability to inspire the most basic reactions toward the characters, especially the antagonists, who belong to a more one-dimensional kind of villains. They can kill everyone in the most cold-blooded way, and this evilness makes the most gruesome deaths, from their side, kind of satisfying. While the first 'Die Hard' was based on the interaction between McClane and Gruber, this one relies on the level of action to accomplish the mission, and the suspense guided by the urgency of the situation: planes stuck in the air on the Christmas Eve with no lighting to guide them to the airport. McClane is in the wrong place at the wrong moment, again, it's Chritsmas, again, his wife is in danger, again, and he's got to go through basements and elevators... again. But these similarities are only the plot elements that contribute to recreate a nice feeling of déjà vu, necessary to enjoy a movie series especially thanks to Bruce Willis' portrayal of John McClane, as charming and charismatic as ever, with everybody against him forced to act by himself. Apart from that, he movie is totally different from 'Die Hard' in terms of violence and body count. It even raised the level of violence to epic proportions, if there was ever an epic-action film, it would be 'Die Hard 2: Die Harder', featuring so many thrilling sequences, especially one involving an ejection seat, that any attempt to question some plot details is useless. Yes, there are many moments where you wonder how this or that solution couldn't have been used but like its glorious predecessor, the movie captivates your body and mind in such a way, you don't have time for purist technicalityWhy are they all cheering and laughing their asses off after the resolution, while so many people died? Why is McClane so reluctant to get into an ambulance? Why should he care about his parking ticket? It's not a movie to judge rationally, it's a good old popcorn film that respect its promise of pure entertainment, but not without a certain amount of shock and gore. The film is much more violent than the first one, and some part can traumatize sensitive eyes, but for the rest, it works as a solid follow-up, respecting the spirit of whatever made the first 'Die Hard' so memorable, at least more than the third opus.I've always enjoyed 'Die Hard 2' and never got the criticism... but I'm sure that among those who visited the threads of IMDb or read the harsh reviews before watching the film, a vast majority would be surprised by the quality of the sequel, probably one of the best movie sequels in an action series. And Yippie-ki-Yay, IMDb users!",9,1,3,2 November 2011
Dirty Dancing," Not flawless, but when judged in the light of what is done today, 'Dirty Dancing' is a definite classic ...
","To some extents, and regarding its respectable classic status, 'Dirty Dancing' plays like the third opus of an unofficial 'Summer 62-63' trilogy, a trilogy rhyming with eulogy to the magical American parenthesis preceding a tumultuous decade that started with Kennedy's assassination, followed by the Vietnam War, the flower power and concluding with the disillusioning departure of Richard Nixon.The first two films were 'American Graffiti' and 'Animal House', and it's interesting how each one embraced the feel of its time. George Lucas' sleeper hit was a nostalgic ode to the 60's and its two youth-defining elements: rock'n'roll and cars. 'Animal House' was zany and anarchic, fitting the rebellious spirit from which 70's artists fueled their inspiration. And 'Dirty Dancing' (two-word titled too) tries to reconcile between both approaches through an improbable love story between a timid teenager with a bourgeois background and a free- spirited punk who works in the same summer resort she spends her vacation with her rich family. The guy is an expert dancer, especially dances that consists on explicitly erotic moves but no matter how 'dirty' they feel, the film handles its material with less subversion you might expect, ending up being the most (unintentionally?) innocent of the three.But is that a criticism? In fact, 'Dirty Dancing' is tailor-made for the 80's and the so-called dirty dancing needed to be sugar-coated for ratings reason, as it didn't try to be a musical version of '9½ Weeks'. So logically, such a nostalgic immersion into a two-decade old era at a time where high-budgeted action-driven blockbusters were the norm could only increase the chances to catch the viewers' eyes (and ears). And for all the pretension it ever had, the film's magic worked, since it ended up being one of the highest-grossing of the year, much more, it reached an iconic status forever immortalized by the timid Frances 'Baby' Levy finally jumping in Johnny Castle's arms. She's your typical not-so ugly duckling, he's the perfect mix of James Dean and John Travolta and it's the typical underdog / impossible romance / coming- to-age story, but when enjoying the immortal 'I've Had the Time of My Life' finale, these considerations hardly matter.Still, I'm not denying there's no room for criticism: reading Roger Ebert's analysis, there's not one statement that doesn't ring true, and it's quite a delight to read how 'Dirty Dancing' inspired a sort of delightfully sarcastic anger toward an overly formulaic plot. Do I need to list these overused devices? Yes, we know, the shy little girl will grow up and become a great dancer. We know that her father won't approve the romance. We know that some unfortunate misunderstanding will make him believe that Johnny is a bad guy, even if one bit of explanation would have cleared everything. And we know that they will finally dance together, the signal induced by the famous, or infamous line 'Nobody puts Baby in a corner', uttered by Patrick Swayze, who by the way, hated that line. Indeed, some pieces of dialog were lacking and some others were too many. But no matter how irritating or predictable every single plot line was, in the context of the film, it didn't betray lousiness in the script but more of a naive straightforward way to get to its point.For instance, having struggled to learn the basic steps of rock and salsa before giving up, I couldn't believe Baby would learn that fast. But I assumed that the purpose of the dirty dancing is to let yourself (as a girl) be guided by your partner's luscious moves and maybe she just 'had it' inside her and had to have that little catalysis from falling in love with her partner. Sure the dirty dancers are obviously professionals, and the racial diversity in the dancing hall is not the most realistic touch of the film. Sure, the whole 'abortion' misunderstanding needed a more serious focus, that and the fact that Baby came from a Jewish background to insist on the family pressure element, à la 'West Side Story'. Sure, the dances were not quite exactly dirty (Ebert admitted himself he was misled) but I guess it referred less to the moves than their earlier perceptions from Levy's perspective. But can we blame the film for having a good and catchy title? I guess it handled with confidence a basic material, the flaws are those of average movies, but for some exceptional reasons, they didn't ruin the enjoyment of 'Dirty Dancing' because the focus was on the two lead performances, which were good. The role of Johnny was perfect for Patrick Swayze, and Jennifer Grey is absolutely convincing and endearing as the indeed baby-faced Baby. Sometimes, that's all you need to make a good film if it has enough confidence and sincerity about its material. Sure, this isn't 'Grease', or 'Saturday Night Fever' but the chemistry works between Grey and Swayze, and we like them. Why being so intellectual?Paraphrasing the Oscar-winning song, 'I've had the time of life' to watch movies and if I didn't see the ending coming, I wouldn't call myself a movie lover. But I guess that's what the expression 'guilty pleasure' was made for. But I respect the achievement of a film that stood the test of time and became such a phenomenon, still considered one of the defining films of the 80's. I also respect it because it's the film that made Patrick Swayze a movie star. And it also gave a one-hit success for Jennifer Grey, the actress who infamously made that rhino-plastic surgery to sink irremediably in anonymity, while it's precisely her 'girl next door' features that touched the public's heart when they came to see 'Dirty Dancing'. Sometimes, an actor should learn lessons from his own characters.And if only for having inspired one of Rogert Ebert's most irresistible reviews, I'm glad the film was done.",7,0,0,14 September 2013
Independence Day," 'Independence Day' or America as the World in Microcosm ...
","Let's get this straight, if only for the visual effects and the thrilling attacks sequences, for the iconic shot of the Empire State Building and White House blown to pieces, without any use of CGI but old good 'miniature' material, 'Independence Day' is a groundbreaking achievement that redefines the purposes of visual and special effects in the Sci-Fi genre. And if only for that, the movie deserves a certain bit of respect.But when you make such a big-budgeted action-packed blockbuster, and expect to impress the eyes of movie goers and make their hearts pound so hard that they forget to put their salty fingers in the popcorn box, why not make a supplementary effect to improve a script that would justify the use of these special effects, and not let the success of a movie rely only on a technological achievement? In 'Independence Day', it's like Roland Emmerich was so confident over the success of his film that he didn't care much for the complaints that would be expressed toward the script and its blatant lack of originality.And if it doesn't take a genius to know that some formulas simply cannot fail, it doesn't take an elitist mindset either to find obvious flaws in the way the story is written, and maybe worse, in the way the characters are written, not portrayed because I think the actors did a satisfying job with what was at their hands. Overall, the humans were fine but how about the Aliens? Couldn't have they come up with something fresher? I found hard to believe that these ugly octopus-like creatures could own a technology powerful enough to wipe out the entire human race. Well, never mind, the point is that I don't buy the argument that just because a movie features spectacular effects, one must suspend his disbelief and enjoy the movie for what it is, especially when the most difficult stuff is perfectly handled. I don't buy the counter-argument either that just because you criticize some elements of the plot, you're some kind of movie buff with a precious taste and a particular dislike for mainstream movies.I genuinely liked 'Independence Day', I enjoyed it and not just as a guilty pleasure. I will never forget the experience in the movie theater when even as a 14 year old kid, I couldn't help but cheer during the President's speech. Oh some parts probably made me cringe, but it's nothing compared to what was thrown to my eyes that night, it was a great year for action films, 'Eraser', 'The Rock' but on that level, 'Independence Day' was a class on its own, that till now, stood the test of time. But the more I thought of it, the more I realize that I loved the experience much more than the story ... well, the result is pretty much the same, and the film was the highest grossing of the year but this indicates the main flaw on special-effects-driven film like 'ID4', they leave as great an impression as a ride on a roller-coaster, but as ephemeral too. Their inner ambition is more to garner the most viewers than to leave an indelible mark on cinematic papers. Again, the team did a good job, but it just could have been so much better on the story department.I don't want to fall in the wisecracking trap by numbering all the clichés that structure the plot; it would be a pointless exercise, because whatever plot was, it was relying on an overused concept anyway. And the film features every single stereotypical elements so cherished by the disaster genre, a lot of social and racial backgrounds presented through the classic external focus with the maximum of diversity as to sustain the beautiful vision of America's melting-pot. In a way, it's more economical to show all the racial minorities that constitute America than the whole world, America as the microcosm of the World. Hell, the liberation from the Alien invasion even coincided with the 4th of July. I hesitate between two words starting with P: pretension or patriotism, but when things are so obviously over the top, I guess it's a more of a clever reminder than we're only watching a film  as if we hadn't noticed before.'Today we celebrate our Independence!' Did that make me cringe as a non-American? Not quite and I doubt the people in the theater pushed their thinking as far as I'm doing right here in a totally different context. In cinemas' darkness, movies affect us more, creating a deeper connection with the protagonists, in that case, a charismatic country. America entertains the world, and never is the empathy as strong as in theaters. I remember how the crowd cheered during that speech, and while I'm not sure people would look at the film the same way now, it makes me realize how these times were still innocent. These lost years between the Gulf War and the September 11th Attacks, when nothing was as religiously and politically lauded as today, from every side. I still look at the attack sequence with cinematically fascinated eyes, but I'm still lucid about the way some people would consider, now, the sight of the Empire State Building's explosion.And I wonder if that works as a critic or an alibi for 'Independence Day' ... world has become a very dangerous place by itself and maybe this is what makes the film an innocent and immature entertainment. Let just think that the real enemy for men is the Alien, when it has come to men vs. men. There's even a sort of sentimental fatalism in the way it shows that it's only in the case of Alien attacks that Humanity will join its forces and be united.Finally, if the movie ever sinned, it's from a childish naivety  or was it deliberate? Or have we become just so mature that we changed our whole mindset regarding movies?",7,0,0,5 October 2011

Gone with the Wind," A universal masterpiece and one of the few privileged films where every scene is a classic on its own ...
","For some nostalgic dreamers, 'Gone With the Wind' is a glorious swan song depicting the fall of the South during a devastating Civil War, and its reconstruction on the ashes of the Old Order, a Civilization forever 'gone with the wind'. It's the adaptation of Margaret Mitchell's epic tale written in bold letters with this peculiar ability to portray the Yankees as the 'bad guys', so common in the stories related by Southerners, as they invite us to understand their idealism if not to root for it: a vision of Gallantry and Old European Nobility where women were courted, wives were submissive to their husbands and slaves treated with paternalism.But for some idealistic spirits, 'Gone With the Wind' resonates as one of the most heart-breaking pages of American History, when the North fought the South in the name of Liberty, Freedom and Justice, and when History, written by the victorious side, ultimately showed the Confederate as the 'ones who were wrong'. 'Gone With the Wind' chronicles what the South used to be, a world where coexisted two cultures, the Whites and the Colored. And the depiction of the slaves oscillates between the high pitched voice of the simple-minded Prissy (Butterfly McQueen) who knew nothing about 'birthin' babies' and the wisdom and authority of Mammy, Hattie McDaniel in her Oscar-winning role: two figures, two extremes, so rooted in our hearts it's impossible to dislike them, despite the obvious stereotypes.For literate minds, History is only the setting while the film is an incredible achievement in storytelling, inviting us to follow a gallery of magnificent and appealing characters during a slice of life, where the passing of time can be felt, when History affects story with mercy or ruthlessness... sometimes tragic, sometimes ironic. It's a narrative whose emotional core is the heroine Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh), whose heart belongs to the charming blonde Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard), married to the gentle and extremely good-hearted cousin Melanie Hamilton (Olivia de Havilland). A triangular love that sets the personality of Scarlett as a remarkable anti-heroine: selfish, greedy, jealous, but so brave, courageous and generous when the circumstances of War forever changed the face of the South. A great soul that could only be revealed by a great opportunity, a pivotal metamorphosis incarnated by the iconic 'As God is my witness, I'll never be hungry again'.The fascinating aspect of Scarlett's personality is that her flaws elevated her above all the other characters: she doesn't care for etiquette, for traditions, her spirit is free, her ego is big and her heart so vulnerable. While the South is definitely turned to the past, Scarlett thinks of the future, as she says: 'after all, tomorrow is another day'. Scarlett is a modern figure and that's what makes her so appealing both in the film and to the audience. And Rhett Butler, Clark Gable in his most defining role as 'the visitor from Charleston', is Scarlet's perfect match. Both don't belong to that era, they think of money, greed, prosperity, and passion. They embody all the values that America would stand for, transcending the old-fashioned setting of the South. But like the South's enthusiasm for War, the same pride that drives their passion would ruin their relationships.For many passionate hearts, this is one of the most intense romances ever adapted to the big screen, a frustrating and seemingly impossible love between two strong-minded egos, two faces staring at each other as if they were at the verge of an irresistible passion or about to fight each other. As Scarlett was visibly jealous of Melanie when she went to bed with Ashley, the movie makes you penetrate the soul of these characters with such intensity you could feel she wished that Melanie could die. A childish and immature attitude, probably shared with Butler who wouldn't have minded if Ashley could die in the War, too. The love between Rhett and Scarlett is made of the same idealism that built the South myth, a lost but so endearing cause, a fire that burnt inside, and made pretty fitting that the most intimate and sensual moment they had was under the orange sky, during Atlanta's big fire. Love has never been as passionate as a love-and-hate relationship and never seemed a romance so comparable to a lost cause, mirroring the Southerners' very faith in victory. Rhett's last stand when he takes Scarlett up the stairs in the 'one night she wouldn't turn him out' is the perfect illustration of a love that pumped its energy from hate and anger. As Scarlett, lost in her love for Ashley, will never realize that her man is Rhett... and when she does, Rhett is already fed up and finally delivers the most unforgettable come-uppance ever: 'Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn' before disappearing in a foggy mist. Scarlett gets a magnificent lesson about life, and wouldn't have been as likable without this last slap in the face. This 'I don't give a damn' voted #1 in the American Film Institute's Top 100 Movie quotes was Rhett's revenge, and he sure deserved it... and many wannabe-Scarlett would admit that too.But while 'Gone With the Wind' deals with lost causes, it's more than anything the triumph of Cinema as the most defining Art of the last century. Echoing the novel's status as a best- seller, it's one of the greatest films of all time, the greatest casting ever, the greatest score and the greatest challenge for superlatives. Victor Fleming's super-production that would become a landmark in film-making, with its unique visual style and beautiful cinematography in colors, forever incarnated by Scarlett's shadowy silhouette standing beside a tree, during a beautiful sunset. Along with 'The Wizard of Oz', and 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington', 'Gone With the Wind' is probably Hollywood's Golden Age reaching its pinnacle before the War would come in 1939 .",10,19,24,19 March 2012
The Butterfly Effect," An entertaining Swiss-cheese of a plot, not without savor ...
","'A flap of wings from a butterfly can provoke a hurricane thousand miles further', 'The Butterfly Effect', aka the 'chaos theory' or 'domino effect' is a darling for movie buffs regardless of its scientific accuracy, probably because nobody can deny its real-life application. Maybe the smallest event have the most dramatic repercussions and maybe the greatest accomplishments we've ever done, or worst mistakes we ever committed, are just conclusions to chains of event that started with a benign fact. That's life's charm: its total and out-of-control unpredictability (except if you are blessed or cursed with Evan's power to change the past).The character of Evan (finely played by Ashton Kutcher) personifies our fascination with time-travel stories through the eternal wish to be given second chances. And no need to question whether life is a disordered assemblage of little hazards or that the same assemblage pave the same way toward a predefined future, if the film believed in destiny, every attempt to change the future from the past would have failed. They don't always succeed though and the film offers several scenarios affecting the lives of five characters. The series start with what happens 'normally' to them: a series of incidents occurring in their childhood and teenage years, each one more dramatic than the other. They seem to be reminiscence from Evan's own memory, which explains some 'blanks' at the end of each, but don't worry; each one will be filled throughout the film.Still, what a nightmarish journey for little Evan, a boy who endures too many traumas for one life! His father is in an institution, he takes a knife in the kitchen in front of his mother (Melora Walthers), he draws murdered prisoners in school. Each visit he makes features a disturbing episode: in his friends Tommy and Kelly's house, their father (Eric Stolz) uses them a pedophile video, and later, his own father tries to kill him, and is incidentally killed. 6 years later, the worst happens again when Tommy, who became a hooligan, lures Lenny, the fat insecure one of the group, to hide a stick of dynamite in a mailbox, which leads to a macabre (and unknown) aftermath. You think you've seen the worst, until another disaster involves the four kids, Evan's dog in a bag, and a flamed torch, forcing Evan and his mother to move out from that evil neighborhood. Surprisingly, nothing seems to have affected Evan's life after that, but that's only because he doesn't remember what happened, hence the memory blanks trick; they put us on Evan's wavelength. And all we have, as clues, are the effects the impacts on his friends, each one turning bad. But while reading one of his old journals, he realizes he can come back in the past. We can only thank the doctor who recommended little Evan to have a journal so he can cure his memory problems, the journals highlight Evan's power to go back to every single event he wrote about, and not only he's capable to live them again, but he can change them, hence, creating a new other reality, not without damaging his brain by inserting in the memory area a new stock of archive footage, causing some intense hemorrhage. The film works both as a psychological thriller and a time travel film and I must admit it had the most exciting premise. If you love non-linear plot lines, the film is tailor-made for you. By interfering in each event, Evan finds himself as a member of a fraternity or with a Gothic roommate, or in the best case, dating Kelly. Kelly is a waitress, a successful schoolgirl or a prostitute, Tommy is either a thug or a very religious person, and the one who takes the cake is poor Lenny, either in a mental institution, traumatized for life in his room or dating Kelly while Evan has lost his arms. That part is the most tragicomic one, as much as we feel sorry for Evan, it's irresistible to see that even that fat loser had chances to date Kelly. That's the triumph on philosophical aspect, this idea that our lives are conditioned by little hazards that could turn us either into on losers or winners. Maybe in another life, Eddie Murphy would have been the President of the United States.So, we gotta hand it to 'The Butterfly Effect', to tackle its subject with mathematical precision and provide us so many surprises. Still, there are as many holes in the plot, as in a Gruyere. The most benign one relies on the basic premise: how come all the changes only affected Evan and his friends? Why do his journals contain the same events? Now, if we assume that a simple warning to the pedophile Dad changed the future, how come stabbing his hands to make scars appear didn't prevent him to return back in jail? Wouldn't that event totally affect his future as a child? Even if we assume not, how come the scars appeared immediately? Shouldn't have then been there from the beginning instead of instantly appearing (like the cigarette burns)? 'Back to the Future' was criticized as well, because of its intellectually challenging question, so this is fair game.Anyway, the film is so fast-paced we don't have much time to figure these subtleties out. I blame the writers and directors for having collected too many material and created the same confusion out of a promising story, at the end, they didn't know what to do with it, it's just as if the film was victim of the same wideness of choices that made Evan's journey so nightmarish. And I guess this is why the writers had many alternative endings to the same story. Still, one happy ending was the best thing the film could have, seriously what were they thinking with that womb-suicide thing? Wasn't the film morbid enough to owe us a happy and satisfying ending?",8,0,2,16 September 2013
No Country for Old Men," It's a hard world for little things ...
","With its fatalistic resonance, the quote, used by the Coen brothers in 'Raising Arizona' and borrowed from 'The Night of the Hunter' could almost work as a subtitle for 'No Country for Old Men'And any critic toward 2007' Best Picture Winner, is irremediably confronted to that opening 'No' summarizing everything the film stands for: nothing. The Coens brothers made fun of nihilists in 'The Big Lebowsky' gave the word an entire new dimension here, thrilling like a dream and haunting like a nightmare. Indeed, in this film, it's not the night, but the 'Nightmare of the Hunter'.But I'll be honest, I didn't get it the first time I saw it, but I give myself the benefit of the doubt since I was 25 at that time, and I think I was intelligent enough to grasp the film's concept. And indeed, I saw it again yesterday, 5 days before my 32nd birthday, and I didn't get it more than the first time; except that I started looking at the so-called flaws with more comprehensive eyesI remembered the words I choose to title my review of 'Shane', an old-fashioned and traditional Western classic, 'the unseen and the unspoken elevate it to its iconic status'. This description also works for 'No Country for Old Men', except that the unseen is what divided opinions the most, it's for what we didn't see that some believed this movie had more a lot to say than what its first acts presented, but it's also why the rest felt betrayed and dismissed it as a pretentious attempt of making art for the sake of it.But let's get back to the film. There are three men that fate reunited (although they'll never meet), each one is in one side of what we, humble mortals, call morality. There's Sheriff Bell, played by Tommy Lee Jones, an old timer contemplating the degeneration of humanity through the peaks of barbarity crimes had reached. But we can't be fooled, surely he belongs to a time where lynching, rapes and horrific crimes prevailed, he's not too old but too good and goodness and strength don't form quite an efficient pair.On the other side, there's the one who elevated the film to its iconic status, Anton Chigurh (Oscar-winning Javier Bardem) the most impacting movie villain since Hannibal Lecter. He's dark, tall, looking even bigger thanks to a meticulous camera work, has a deep authoritative voice and an ominous aura above his shoulder, like a real-life Darth Vader. He would indeed look like Darth Vader from behind with his weird haircut. And there's his inseparable oxygen tank hiding under an everyday banality, a spectacularly deadly weapon. Anyway, in vileness department, Anton means business. And in the course of his morbid odyssey, he'll meet friendly people from the American side of Rio Grande, and many of them will pay the biggest price to their encounter, a price that can be worth a quarter sometimes. Anton reminded me of a story about a king who was so cruel that when he surprised one of his slaves mocking him in public, he then told him the worse punishment had to come. What did he do? Nothing, and that was even worse, because the poor man died out of fearful stress. This is what we, what the poor gas station attendant understand, life can hang on nothing, a simple call, a coin, two millions, whatever.Llewellyn Moss (Josh Brolin) is a hunter who found two million dollars in the middle of the desert, only trophy from a drug deal that left many Mexican cadavers and a dog rotting in the desert, the crime scene is magnificently rendered by Roger Deakins' cinematography, like a still-life painting. There's still life indeed, Moss takes the money and run, but out of principles, gets back to the crime scene to give some poor man's water. Wrong move, he puts himself on the track and worse, gets Chigurh on his footsteps. Moss is in the crossroads, bad enough to steal and endanger his sweet and caring wife Carla Jean (Kelly MacDonald) but good enough to care. You know at that time that either him or Anton will survive.We have a sadistic killer, whose use of violence is random, remorseless and even more chilling when you try to give it a meaning. Then, you have a fatalistic journey where despite all of Moss' efforts, you feel like there's no way he'll get through it, because there's a movement incarnated by Chiugurh' slow walk in the middle of a motel, from nowhere to someone, this is the Great Reaper coming, you can't escape from it, you can only postpone the delay. And there's the main protagonist, a defeatist sheriff who can't face the facts that he's not cut for the job anymore, and spends most of his time desperately static, the's the nihilistic, he's the 'No' in the title. He's the main character, the key of the story.That might explain the narrative liberties the Coens took  both Moss and Chigurh are neatly drawn characters, they're mysterious but not their motives, and the movie's intelligence shall rise above obviousness. Bell, in his last courageous attempt to listen to Carla Jean's pleas, to save Moss and get Anton, comes too late, he didn't see what happened, neither did we. Why insisting on so many details, so many on-screen deaths, why making Woody Harrelson introduced as a bad-ass bounty hunter and killed as mercilessly as you stamp on a cockroach?Because it's the unseen that best expresses life's futility, things either guided by God or the devil's hand, and there's no guarantee that goodness will be rewarded and that's what scares the most. The film has style, yes, but it's not about being deep, depth is nothing when nothingness can be deeperSo, don't blame the Coens brothers for what you didn't see, blame Sheriff Bell.",10,2,3,7 August 2014
District 9," A sci-fi modern classic that challenges our so-called humanity ..
","In my 'Manchurian Candidate' review, I called it a fair deal that the film portrayed Americans confusing anti-communism driven patriotism with lunacy, while centering on an existing Communist conspiracy. In the same vein, 'District 9' exploits archive footage of South Africans criticizing immigrants for real yet without sugarcoating immigration either. I admire a movie that shows us as a whole capable of the best as well as the worst regardless on the color of skin or demographic group.On that level, the film is as smart as 'The Manchurian Candidate' and as prophetic. Indeed, there are so many parallels you can draw between the situations of Alien refugees in Johannesburg and the massive wave of immigration in Western countries it's eerie. I read many Youtube comments comparing the Aliens to some communities, even using racial slurs to define them, actually these comments don't miss the film's point, they make it in an indirect way by showing the very rampant intolerance the film is denouncing.And to the patronizing idea that Black South-Africans are supposed to be more compassionate toward the aliens who are undergoing a new Apartheid (District 9 is a nod to District 6, and you can find all the information on Wikipedia), the unanimousness toward the alien case actually shows a form of universal disdain toward a non-human species that ironically united old enemies. Take for instance 'Invictus', a movie made the same year and set in South Africa: Clint Eastwood showed how the same passion for rugby united Blacks, Afrikaners and every layer of South Africa's new society into the same united community during the World Cup. Here we have the same effect with a common enemy that doesn't even behave like one.The film asks a relevant question about alien invasions: what if they don't invade us? And it's a valid scenario given the way these aliens look. They aren't exactly the prettiest-looking and the little one makes E.T. as cute as Shirley Temple. They're constantly referred to as 'prawns' just like the Tutsi were called 'cockroaches' in 'Hotel Rwanda'. Their physical features seem to obey to scientific speculation as much as artistic licenses, but it's important that they inspire instant disgust and defiance. And that's the stuff genocides are made of.Yes, with all the talk about 'learning from WW2', the film confronts us to a very delicate question: since we care so much about humans, we defined crimes against humanity, since we believe animals deserve respect, where would creatures we consider lower than both groups stand in our standards of appreciation? And 'District 9' is interesting in the way the young director Neil Blomkamp, in his debut, guides us into a journey of humility and understanding.First the film opens with a newsreel, a masterstroke of exposition, giving us enough information and footage to accept the presence of these aliens in South Africa since 1982 as historical reality. Then we get to 2010 where a multi-national corporation named MNU volunteered to relocate the 'prawns' to a bigger area with better facilities. The supervision of the operation is given to one of these 'employee-of-the-month' guys I used to despise since my days in Procter and Gamble.His name is Wikus Van De Merwe, he's played by Sharlto Copley and the act he puts in front of the camera to impress the big shots, especially his CEO (who happens to be his father-in-law) is symptomatic of that human contempt I described. The mockumentary style enhances that biased, one-sided, outsider's 'civilized' perspective. And we see humans acting with the aliens as if they were a 'lower race', forcing them to move from the ghetto under the threat of soldiers from diverse ethnicities.Remember 'Aliens' when the squad found the nest with the Queen and started destroying the eggs, we couldn't shed a tear for them, we knew how potentially lethal they were. But we've only seen the prawns burning trucks or being annoyances, a commentator explaining that they might not have the same behavior standards (of course, they don't), the worse they did was slashing a man's arm but even then, I hated the casual way Wikus torched the egg-place and laughed at the pop-corn sound it made.Even his portrayal during the news' section show him as a not-so bright man, compromising and friendly. Wikus embodies our condescending nature, too cocky to even wear a mask, which will start his trouble... and eventually, his redemption. And this is perhaps the best thing about the film. As soon as he's contaminated by an accidental spray and slowly turns into an alien, his personality evolves as well. The film shifts the genre and turns from documentary to more conventional narrative and let Copley lead the show with his spectacular performance.This is not just a director's but an actor's film. The evolution of Wikus from an slick blue-collar guy with the hair on the side and the yellow vest to a man scared out of death and realizing the extent of humans' barbarity once he's submitted to it, is the true highlight of the film. The MNU shows its true self as well, a greedy corporation resorting to torture and arbitrary killing to get the hold on a sophisticated machinery under a commander whose enjoyment to kill prawns remind of other soldiers from the darkest hours.The parallel is even stronger when Wikus reveals that the place of relocation is no better than a concentration camp as he tells the one prawn he befriended, 'Christopher Johnson'. I won't spoil the third act. It might feel formulaic with its avalanche of shooting and action sequences but it's in the tradition of many sci-fi classics to entertain and thrill as much as asking thought-provoking questions.Indeed, regarding Wikus, he might have regained his humanity. But the film teaches us not to take that word for granted.A sci-fi modern classic that challenges our so-called humanity ...",9,0,0,4 March 2019
Mamma Mia!," Fun and enjoyable, but let's face it, the hardest part was over...
","'Mamma Mia!' is such an openly and shamelessly cheerful movie that any attempt to criticize it would make you sound like a killjoy, as infuriating and convenient as it is, it's not that far from the truth. And I would lie if I said I didn't find myself enjoying the film most of the time, but on the other hand, I disagree that a film should be immune to criticism just on the basis of the positive emotions it inspires, which supposedly compensates every loose ends or plot flaws. Speaking for myself, I have at least five ABBA songs in my playlist and there are certainly five more I would instantly recognize and hum if I heard them, I don't know how much a 'fan' that makes me, but let's just say that I like their songs, I even love some and I think they are some of the catchiest Pop-Music ever produced, with a super power, they mix very well with movie or TV scenes. I still have in mind, the dance between Dewey and babysitter played by Bea Arthur in 'Malcolm in the Middle', with 'Fernando' (one of my favorite ABBA songs) in the background or 'Waterloo' playing while Mr. Burns was pulling a 'Ride of the Valkyries' attack on the Simpsons' house. ABBA songs have that incredible appeal, and it's no wonder that Catherine Johnson thought it would make a terrific musical, and no wonder it was that successful. But what I expected from the film (directed by Phyllida Lloyd) was to rely on a little more than the worldwide popularity of ABBA songs and the musical, because one can easily argue that the hardest part was over, the songs were great already; even the 'plot' on which to hang every popular song was written, with the exception of 'Fernando' (couldn't they invent a character with that name!?). Now, I saw the bonus features and I understand how shooting on location was difficult and what's more, teaching all the actors how to sing and dance, but with such a star-studded cast, the film was a no-fail-guarantee, let's not kid ourselves. And I won't even complain about the cast, Streep and Seyfried made the film, their enthusiasm was so catching that the screen was always illuminated by their presence, and the three bimbo males (Firth, Brosnan and Skargaard) took the whole thing in good spirit and everything was made in a fun and innocent way. So what went wrong? Nothing exactly, except that the film basically recycled the plot from the original version and put stars into it, the director didn't try to appeal to a more demanding audience or to enrich the story a little bit, as if she was convinced it would be a hit already. In the end, the story doesn't really matter, and if some plot elements are incredibly contrived, if it's the kind of idiotic plot that could be solved if simple questions were asked at the right moment, well, we'll just have to pretend that the film is deliberately fun and corny and doesn't take itself seriously, so why should we? But I don't know, sometimes, I enjoy the 'what the heck, let's have fun' aspect, and sometimes, I wonder if they aren't all in on a big joke, that we're supposed to enjoy, without asking questions. But I'm sorry, I couldn't believe Donna wouldn't figure out why these three guys were here at the same time, I couldn't believe that it took her till the wedding to realize the truth or not to have the right conversation with her daughter, I couldn't believe that that free-spirited woman would finally pick that guy and I couldn't believe that the three guys would react the same way. I understand that the plot is as unconventional and lighthearted as a female-oriented fantasy, but these are not complex points, and the reason why I insist on these elements is because the impact of a song should rely on the moment's genuine emotional resonance. When Streep sings 'The Winner Takes it All', it should have been a powerful moment, emotionally rewarding, but since they preferred 'not to take themselves seriously'', well, it only works for the song is powerful, nothing else. See, I only wish that 'Mamma Mia!' tried to be embrace its own free-spirited fun and take enough distance from the stage musical, so that we could wonder if we loved the story as well as the songs. The film took its material for granted and didn't try to elevate it a little more. I understand we should enjoy it for what it is, but sometimes, that just works as a convenient alibi against criticism, especially since there are other feel-good musicals that still cared about telling a good story, 'Chicago' or 'Singin' in the Rain' to name them.Now, I feel guilty after having written these lines, to conclude on a positive note, I'll say this is an enjoyable movie as far as you can enjoy ABBA song, the beautiful Mediterranean isles' landscape and Meryl Streep and Amanda Seyfried's communicative smiles, I guess sometimes that's enough. But it's precisely because I enjoyed these elements that I wish the film tried a little more. To keep on the bright side, after having watched the 2016 'Ghostbusters', I want to say 'Mamma Mia!' is the perfect example of how a film can make fun of men in such a good spirit that even a man can enjoy it.This is film written, directed and driven by women, but it's far from being just a chick flick, not surprising since ABBA was perhaps one of the rare bands represented by both sexes., and certainly the most successful. At least, this is a film that is not divisive, and it's fun, positive, exactly what 'Ghostbusters' should have been, but wasn't.",7,2,4,3 November 2016
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," The Immortalization of Jesse James by the Tragically Naive Robert Ford...
","There's always a temptation to get over-analytical with the revisionist Western sub-genre. These moody movies, like 'Shane', 'McCabe & Mrs. Miller' or 'Unforgiven' paint a portrait of the Old West at the twilight of its existence. Whether from the perspectives of Natives and homesteaders who, realize the march of progress is a roller-coaster ignoring the values of individual lives or outlaws and marshals discovering that they belong to a dying breed of men, the Old West shrunk like a Balzac pebble-leather taking with it the frontier spirit.The 'end of an era' is the most prevalent element of modern Western and Andrew Dominik's 'Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford', a film served by impeccable acting and hypnotic cinematography by Roger Deakins. There's an obvious kinship between this title and 'The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance', we care less for the death, which awaits us all than the way fate lures the primarily concerned to the deadly encounter. And the Jesse James we see is played by a self-conscious but oddly poignant Brad Pitt, like a living ghost, a man floating above the darker shadows of fame with a magnetic aura. Ask anyone today about Jesse James, words 'outlaws', bank robberies will come to mind but also that nickname that earned his ticket to posterity: Robin Hood. Yes, this is the Old West, quoting 'Liberty Valance', 'when legend becomes fact, print the legend'. At the Civil War's aftermath, people could find excuses to criminals, and Jesse James was always seen as a man faithful to the Confederate flag and who robbed Yankees banks to repair injustices. This is certainly a shortcut from reality, he certainly killed more innocent men than Robert Ford, but James is a legend nonetheless. You can tell it from the morbid attraction his death gathered, the quasi-mystification of his life or any item he ever approached. You can just tell it by the number of movies or books made about him, while Robert Ford, will always be associated to the word 'Coward', Judas, backstabber. But no one would want such a reputation, and certainly not Ford who only wanted to join the gang, along with his brothers and has his share of James' fame.Robert Ford is certainly one of the most fascinating cinematic characters of the last two decades; he was certainly overlooked because 2007 saw the more iconic and larger-than-life Anton Chigurh from 'No Country for Old Men'. But Ford embodies this puzzling correlation between death and admiration; one that caused John Lennon to be killed by a fan. Ford is a man who knows the times of Old West legends is coming to an end and wants to make a name out of his, believing he's 'destined for great things'. But this is a man who's not the tenth James is, he's awkward, effeminate, full of shy mannerisms that immediately betray a sneaky side of his personality. One minute with Frank James (Sam Shepard) and the old man draws his gun, telling him to get out because he 'gives him the willies'. But it seems like his brother Jesse is more tolerant.Indeed, Jesse James gives Bob a chance and starts a weird relationship whose culmination is the titular assassination. Bardem won the Oscar for 'No Country' but he played a villain, albeit not one-dimensional. Casey Affleck (who got many awards nods, including the Oscar) plays something that is lower than the concept of the villain but more spectacular in terms of acting, he's the wimp, the well-meaning but ultimately weak man whose personal hubris conducts him to kill people who actually appreciated him, he's Jerry Lundegaard in 'Fargo' or Fredo Corleone and it takes some super acting to play these awkward and highly contemptible people. Affleck even adds a dimension of troll-faced, double-crossing youth that makes him even scarier.The fact that at the end, we still feel sorry for him says a lot about the beauty of the film. We understand that he meant 'well', he wanted to be a new Pat Garrett, yet he didn't understand his world. He didn't foresee that reenacting 800 times the assassination would only make him an even more detestable public figure while he could have left the killing a mystery. There was no witness besides his brother Charley (Sam Rockwell) Ford could have claimed it was self-defense, people would have suspected him, he might even have been killed anyway, but how could he ever believe that he would earn a heroic reputation by explicitly killing someone in the back and taking pride from it.Ford became a living ghost in suspended sentence, waiting to be killed; his name would forever be associated with James, but not the way he intended. The film, while not forgiving the action of Ford, presents him like a tragic figure victim of unfortunate illusions. And I have a feeling that he was also victim of James, the film insists on showing James as a man of fading health, growing paranoia and irrational behavior, being chased by all the Marshalls of the country would drive anyone insane. Many times, James take someone for 'a ride' and we understand it's the euphemism mobsters use for 'take care', the plot isn't always clear but it efficiently highlights the mindsets that inhabits the two main characters, the cast does justice to the film, Jeremy Renner and Rockwell especially, but it's all between Pitt and Affleck. And I had the feeling Pitt chose the suicidal angle, he who always rides behind a man, lowered his guard with Ford, gave him a gun, taunted him, threatened his brother as if he was really asking for his death, it's like a hypnotic macabre dance lead by James who knew the last step before immortality was a legendary murder. Ford served him that on a silver platter.One could even ask who really 'assassinated' the other?",8,2,3,21 June 2017
Toy Story 4," There was a time where Disney movies were telling stories, now it's all about sending messages...
","I know time is up to dust off a few gender-driven stereotypes. For that, 'Frozen' was a landmark. But there's a fine line between creating new characters and promoting their differences and deconstructing old characters that belong to a whole other storyline in order to promote a difference, that's when I get the feeling that Disney is dangerously toying with its own legacy.To make myself more specific, I would have no problem with a film centering on a gender exclusive romance and maybe that will be 'Frozen II' novelty, but I would have a problem if they made a sequel to 'The Fox and the Hound' in order to suggest that there was more than a friendship between Todd and Copper. Watching 'Toy Story 4', I felt betrayed by the way the whole relationship between toys and owners, that took a trilogy to be built, was demystified in one single film to shine a light on Disney's 'new order'.All the previous 'Toy Story' movies had a specific story. The first was exploring the psychology of toys within their relationships with their owners. Anyone could relate to that, kids who own toys and adults who used to. It also sealed the friendship between Woody and Buzz, as two of Andy's favorites, not rivals. The second film established the issue of growing up through the Jessie situation and the impeding doom of hormone-driven rejection. Still, Andy and Woody realized that they were not articles among others or valuable items to be worshiped, having ANDY written on their feet was their value and it was perfect while it lasted.The trilogy ended with the perfect tone (and note), Andy, now grown-up, realizes that the sentimental value of his toys depend on their current utilization as much as their past, so he gives all the toys, including Woody, to Bonnie. For the first time, there's a voluntary separation between the partners, it's an end of era but also a new start. And the toys' 'circle of life' has always been about children having toys not toys having children, the song wasn't 'I've got a friend in you' after all. In that fourth opus, there's such an obsession with that notion of 'having children' that it felt like they were procreating them. I'm not exaggerating, it's used so many times it became a whole overarching theme.But I didn't have a problem with that because the film started with a rather touching scene. Feeling rejected by Bonnie, Woody follows her in her first day at school and helps her create a new toy, 'Forky', I just loved the way the 'Spork' came alive on the sole basis that he was considered a toy, and the way Woody felt responsible in a fatherly that wasn't totally out of place in the film's context. Because the motive was still Bonnie: he didn't want her to lose her new toy, Woody was still thinking of his owner, and that's the way all toys behaved, not because that's the way it should be, but because that's the way it was established as soon as the series began.This is why I just hated the way Woody admitted at the end that he did that because he had nothing else to do, as if toys were supposed to have an existence of their own, and being a lost toy was an option. Woody cared for Bonnie and Forky and it was out of character to describe this as a weakness. But the film constantly shows Woody as a weak character, both morally and physically, and for that, the studios came up with the right contrast: Bo Peep who is of course the incarnation of the Disney heroine, she's brave, bad-ass, perfect, not one ounce of vulnerability and nothing is impossible to her. Meanwhile, Jessie was relegated to a tertiary character while she could have been the female lead after all.The character of Gabby Gabby was a great addition though, acting like a Disney villain (especially with her scary minions-automatons) but displaying a hidden depth that broke my heart. That Gabby had the potential, but Bo was such a caricature that I could hear the marketing strategy behind her creation 'let her awesomeness put Woody to shame' and she did a great job at that. Naturally, she's proud of not 'having children' which seems to associate parenting with a form of commitment a girl should be proud to reject. Quite hypocritical from a studio whose main audiences aren't seniors.Now, maybe I'm overanalyzing, but when you also have two toys who insist on 'having children' since they've been 'waiting for three years' and they're males, it's of course a nod to the right for adoption, which draws the obvious parallel between belonging to children and having children. Which says in subtext, women shouldn't make raising families a priority but it's clearly one for those who've been denied this right. The message isn't wrong but just off-topic in the context of a series where a/ toys have always been the possessed ones not the possessors, b/ when the possession was a mark of friendship and nothing else and c/ when viewers could relate to owners, even from the toys' perspective. By over-humanizing them to make them timely relevant, something of the series' charm was lost.My view is rather conservative but only in the sense that I wished the spirit of 'Toy Story' to be conserved the way it was in the first three films, I enjoy a progressive film like anyone, but I wish Disney could do that with new characters, not with series whose arcs were perfectly closed. But I think I see where they're coming from, they're probably preparing a spin-off prequel that will center on Bo Peep, so maybe 'Toy Story 4' is only a vehicle for her. Ironic that in the film, it's a skunk.",6,7,14,27 June 2019
Batman Begins," If you're a fan of Batman, you'll love it, if you're not a fan, you'll become one after watching this film...
","Four decades after the TV series, two after the first film, Batman wasn't exactly a beginner, so the title might sound a bit presumptuous in the context of 2005 if only because everyone thought the saga actually ended with that dreadful 'Batman & Robin'. But that was underestimating Christopher Nolan, he didn't just revive a cinematically dead saga but proved beyond a (dark) shadow of a doubt that it hadn't even begun.
But it needed to come so late and I knew I was right to watch the previous movies before Nolan's take, because it's only in that order that you realize how underexploited the potential of the DC icon was, as far as characterization goes. Indeed, it's not just in the way Nolan takes us to the origins of Batman (Christian Bale), to Bruce Wayne's childhood, his trauma with bats, the death of his parents and his initiation by Ducard (Liam Neeson), it's how it plays later in the 'revealing' scene.
Take the first Batman, a classic, no doubt about it: it starts with criminals who don't fool us about their status as baits for the heroic entrance. Keaton popping up and saying: 'I'm Batman' probably had some members of the audience clapping and cheering but it doesn't hold up now, you know it's just the kind of trailer-filler scenes with no other pretension than introducing the hero. What happens is that, villains you don't care about are stopped by Batman who can take care of himself, so it's not that we don't but we can't root for him.
But boy, when the 'I'm Batman' moment happens halfway through that film, after all that journey where he kept looking for himself, asking whether he's seeking revenge or justice, after all the wandering and wondering, all the tasks and duels and pains and stitches, all the brainstorming with Alfred (Michael Caine) about the right identity and with engineer Fox (Morgan Freeman) for the costumes and the 'gadgets', when he finally comes up fully-dressed... we know it's not just a superhero in a fancy costume, what we've got is an achievement... and I was cheering inside. And not not just because of the hero. We saw Tom Wilkinson laying his cards in front of a mildly impressed Bruce Wayne, which makes the villain's come-uppance twice more enjoyable. 
That scene alone is the reason why Nolan was right to make 'Batman Begins'. When it started, I was like 'what the hell...?' I kept waiting for the Batman tropes, Gotham City, the logo, the Batmobile, Alfred... but then I realized that Superman had started the same way and when we could finally see the nerdy Kent opening his shirt with the 'S' logo, we were finally rewarded for our patience. Nolan trusts our patience as well and is generous enough to make a few allusions to the Batman we know, like with the infamous parent's murder scene. And once again, even that scene is played at the right time, after many glimpses on Bruce's relationship with his father and his own fear, and see how it all comes full circle with that defining murder. I think it just comes down to one thing: give everything a meaning.
Why Batman? Why the bats? Why a black uniform? Why never killing anyone? Everything has an answer, a meaning, an origin. I love how Nolan tries to give some realism to Batman's origins, not to make the film realistic but plausible in the realm of superheroes movies... so real that Batman shouldn't even be considered a superhero. This is not just a good film, but a good story. Good in the classical sense, with the coming-of-age, the hero triumphing over his initial demons, then gaining enough strength to give a meaning to that first triumphant step and good in the writing. 
For instance, notice how the word 'vigilante' is mentioned twice, by Ducard and later by the commissioner, Nolan was aware about the kind of labels that go with a character like Batman, and he doesn't deny them as much as he gives them a new weight, it's like 'Yes, but there's more to it...'. A vigilante always has style and an attitude that betrays an unconscious desire to 'show off' a little but in reality, Batman is perhaps the ultimate vigilante because he goes from a totally selfish desire to get his revenge to protecting a town that is corrupted to the core and all the style and the attitude are only meant to scare his opponents, to hide in the night, as a matter of fact, again, everything can be explained.
And this is nothing compared to the way the word 'fear' is repeated, serving the film's motto that we're all meant to fall, but it's all about picking ourselves up. From another director, it could sound corny but not with Nolan, and certainly not with Caine playing a great Alfred. And this comes from someone who likes the other Alfred, too. The cast is another highlight of the film, honorable mention to Gary Oldman, Cillian Murphy and even Katie Holmes who was shockingly nominated for a Razzie, granted she wasn't Oscar worthy but that was a low blow, even by Razzies' standards. Speaking of the Oscars, the film was so full of great visual effects and action sequences that I was surprised it only gathered one nomination for Cinematography, but quite a deserved one, the shots on Gotham City were breath-taking.
You know I've never been fan of DC or Marvel Comics, but I always loved the Disney Duck stories with Scrooge McDuck and Donald... and what Nolan did reminded me of Keno Don Rosa's 'Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck', he took an iconic character and provided a level of depth and a dimension that went beyond the format of the comic-book canon. I guess if there ever was a 'Batman' hall of fame, Nolan would be in the Top 5 not far from the creators or Adam West.",10,1,1,31 March 2018
Liar Liar," Jim Carrey as the man who 'can't handle the lie' ...
","Ever since societies existed, lies could either be the drivers or killers of human relationships, but I guess we have to blame it on truth. The trick with the truth is that sometimes we want to tell it but not to hear it, or vice versa. Do we really want to know what is said about us at the third person? Truth is a social double-edged sword, and lying a psychic boomerang, hitting you in the face when you don't expect it.This is why the main premise of a film like 'Liar, Liar' where a man endures the curse of not lying, worse: not being able to articulate one lousy syllabic that wouldn't tell the truth is not only hilarious, but intellectually challenging, as it incites us to question the place 'lying', occupies in our lives and daily agendas... and occasionally on America's judiciary system. Indeed, maybe the fact that the story focuses on a slick lawyer in Los Angeles, a sort of Lionel Hutz in flesh and blood and competence, asks a bit too much on the suspension of disbelief department, still what a premise, the kind that probably started with a simple 'what if' question and one wondered how no one ever got this idea before. It seems so clever, yet so simple, but it's not a laugh-riot guarantee either, my guess is that it's the kind of plot premises that can only work if you have the comical performance to efficiently conduct it from paper to screens. Think about that, 'a man can't lie', so what, what is funny? The fact that he can't lie can easily become redundant; it's all in the diversity of reactions then. And who's better than Jim Carrey to takes you by surprises even when you expect to laugh? Only Carrey could have been so hilariously, pathetically, frantically funny in his desperate attempts to let one single lie comes out of his mouth, especially the day of a very tough divorce and child custody trial.Jim Carrey delivers his funniest performance, and certainly one of the funniest of the 90's, Adam Sandler? Chris Farley? 'Liar, Liar' is the ultimate proof that Carrey is the real thing when it comes to comedy. Carrey's face is a gift from Cinematic Gods, hell, you don't even need CGI, it's like every parcel of his face is capable of displaying more hilarious elasticity than all the comics of his generation combined in all of their films. 'Liar, Liar' is 80 minutes of demonstration, of Carrey's talent and comical superiority. Naturally, it's not just all about grimaces, funny faces or scream, like the best comedies, 'Liar, Liar' has a heart and maintains an overwhelming everyday feeling, we're enjoying Carrey's talent, but still, we think of our own lives or lies.Marking the return of Jim Carrey after the film 'that almost ruined his career' according to Homer Simpson, 'Liar, Liar' is the second collaboration with Tom Shadyak after 'Ace Ventura: Pet Detective' in 1994, the breakthrough year where he starred in 3 movies from the Box- office Top 10. He made it again with 'Liar, Liar', for all the zaniness, Jim Carrey played a more mature, and identifiable character through Fletcher Reed, half liar, half lawyer (a clever opening joke probably lost in translation in all the foreign versions). While it does flirt a little bit with the too-busy-to-see-his-son father cliché, it avoids it by focusing on lying, this is Fletcher's problem, he can't see his child because he just built his whole life, professional, social and familial, on lying.And when the kid gets one lie too much, he blows the candle of his birthday cake and makes the wish that his father can't lie during 24 hours, the curse applies immediately with the hilarious sex aftermath comment followed by the unforgettable drool-inducing elevator scene. Indeed, this scene speaks for all the men who tried to maintain eye-control in front of a nice pair of juicy  well, that's our mind whispering to us, and Fletcher's nightmare is that it's his mind controlling his words. And while transposing his case to my personal life, I wondered to what extent my life would have been different if I had one day without lying. I even shudder thinking to the eventuality of my wife asking me some questions about my past. Of course, it's just a film, but still.So, as soon as the curse operates, the movie takes off for a magnificent, flamboyant bravura performance from Jim Carrey, one gag after another, making the little archetypes, from the cute Justin Cooper with the worst haircut ever to Maura Tierney, the comprehensive divorced wife who still has feelings toward her ex-husband and the dull and boring replacer, Cary Elwes doing well in a rather ungrateful role, not to mention the scene-stealing Jennifer Tilly as the slutty ambitious unfaithful wife, they all become insignificant, because it's Carrey's film. And Carrey carries it with the power of his face, and a terrific script, one that visits every kind of situation where the 'to lie or not to lie' dilemma plays a pivotal role, even one that allows Fletcher to relieve himself by roasting everyone during an unforgettable board meeting, literally the film's laugh-out-loudest moment. And we catch our breath during some genuine moments of true father- and-son tenderness showcasing an unknown capability for seriousness, something the previous movies didn't show. And 'Liar, Liar' probably played a vital and pivotal role in Carrey's career, proving he was at ease with slapstick humor (damn, I can't get the face he had with the luggage thing stuck in his face) and emotions too, a versatility that would be confirmed in 'The Truman Show' one year later. And 'Liar, Liar' concludes with a nice moral, if you build your life on lies, it might collapse sooner or later, if did for Fletcher, but the essential remained, and he would finally value it.",8,0,1,17 January 2013
To Rome With Love," From 'To Rome With Love', to 'To Woody, With Hate'...
","Woody Allen has always been enamored with Europe and Europe has always repaid him well in return. Nothing extraordinary with Allen's European appeal since he's always been influenced by Bergman and Fellini, both emotional and intellectual school of film-making approaching the things of life, with Allen's humor to spice it all. In result; there has always been a love story between Woody and Europe. 'To Rome With Love' only states what we've known already and on the scale of the many masterpieces that paid heartfelt tribute to Allen's European heritage, it's a minor offering.
Besides, 'To Rome With Love' was released six years ago which on the scale of Hollywood history and the major upheavals following the Weinstein's scandal, are an eternity, the end of 2017 shook up Hollywood like no other year did and the tectonic resonance of the MeToo and TimeUp movement finally reached Woody Allen. Recently, many stars who starred in his movies expressed their regrets and validated their apologies with donations to the concerned organizations, Chalamet did it right after starring in the next Allen film. Colin Firth regretted working with Allen, so did Greta Gerwig and Ellen Page who both starred in 'To Rome With Love'.
I was just complaining that Allen might have lost his touch after the dreadful 'Café Society' but I'm afraid that it would be now the least of his concerns. The director who feared the Weinstein scandal would turn into a witch hunt seemed to have indirectly prophesized the very crumble of his legacy, at a time where media outrage is more vocal than court judgments. It seems that stars believed the best option is to believe the allegations against Allen, whether they're right or wrong is beside the point, career-wise, it's the right move. So, I'm not sure how we can exactly judge 'To Rome With Love' with today's scope, the film seems like a relatively feeble attempt to resurrect the charm of his more glorious decades while not totally devoid of hilarious moments. I wish I could love the film more, but it seems so futile by now, like an exercise in Allenisms with actors trying to play the game while not totally in it... or am I influenced by their late statements? 
Anyway, there is a moment where a retired opera director played by Allen discovers a man who can only sings perfectly under the shower, I don't know if it's intended to be a tribute to the classic Looney Tunes' cartoon 'One Froggy Eveneing' but only in an Allen movie, you could have an opera scene where a man sings Pagliachi with an incongruous shower set on stage. It was so nonsensical and yet predictable that it could almost be strung with the most surrealist Allen's moments and enough to earn this film two extra points of rating. If only the other parts were as good.
One of them involve Jesse Eisenberg falling in love with a young student who seems to know exactly what to say to arouse him sexually, she's played by Ellen Page. Alec Baldwin is in every scene, like a not so imaginary friend, for the record, he's the only one who didn't backstab Allen yet. A second story involves a family misunderstanding between a man who must present his fiancée to his uptight family but must save face by pretending it's the luscious prostitute played by Penelope Cruz, meanwhile his fiancée lives another adventure involving a sexy burglar and has been actor. And the fourth is about an average clerk played by Roberto Benigni who suddenly becomes a celebrity without any reason.
And it's very telling when the part that obviously tries to 'make a statement' about celebrity ends up being the least successful one. The film is never as funny as when it goes to the zaniest direction and never as boring as when it tries to say something. There are many questions raised in these short films, but only the lighthearted moments allow the film to elevate itself above its heavy contrivances. Rome is such a big presence that it doesn't take much to make a film about it, but Allen overplays the postcard homage for no reason at all, granted it was part of his European tour, but Allen have proven to be a heir to Fellini with his 'Radio Days' and 'Stardust Memories'.
Indeed, there's always been something Italian without the need to go all 'Mamma Mia' without it... no pun intended of course.",6,1,2,7 February 2018
Meet the Fockers," Meh...
","In 2004, half of the 10 highest-grossing movies were sequels to previous box-office winners released less than 2 or 3 years before: 'Shrek 2', 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban', 'Spider-Man 2', 'Ocean Twelve' and naturally, 'Meet the Fockers'. It's also worth noticing that four of these five sequels were second installments. Obviously, you don't change a winning recipe is a motto followed by many producers, and who can blame them in an industry driven by money and profit?But I'm not trying to be cynical, not yet. The reason I raise these statistics is because they prove indeed that the sequel of a good movie will always attract viewers, as if it was covering half-of the marketing budget just by being a sequel. The trick is to follow a pattern that succeeded and inject enough newness to surprise the viewers. The point is to never get too distant from the original material and still be new. Well, that can work with plot-driven movies and linear narrative; however, it's more difficult to be original when a film is the continuation of a situation-driven comedy, like 'Meet the Parents'.The original film was about being an outsider, about a clash resulting from a triangular love : Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) loved his girlfriend, Pam (Teri Polo), Jack Byrnes (Robert De Niro) loved his daughter, so both guys had to get along despite their different mentalities. Naturally, at the end, they both started to appreciate each other, the peace pipe was smoked and all went well that ended well, so there had to be another plot device for the comic-of-opposition, so after an exhaustive brainstorm they thought: how about discovering Greg's family? And the casting of Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand as the Fockers' couple retired in Hawaii, could only be encouraging.The effect would be doubled, first we have to replay the games with equal rules, it's time for good old Jack Byrnes to learn about the Fockers' customs and philosophy of life, and put in perspective his 'personal' methods. How someone who believes his daughter never had sex before marriage would deal with a sex-therapist? How would a constipated, overly-protective man deal with spontaneous persons who believe in letting nature speaks, and people to follow their instincts? Secondly, it would be exciting to discover what kind of parents could raise a boy like Gaylord Focker.The problem is that the two premises cancel each other, the Fockers' irritate Byrnes because they're free-spirited, open-minded, everything he's not, but that's the way they are, and they never try to be something else, it's mildly funny but it's nothing compared to Greg's attempt to please Jack that turns out to be disasters. The second problem is that the parents are so optimistic, so jovial and upbeat, she believes in sex as the greatest medium of expression, he's a lawyer who believes that winning is not the most essential thing, how could they end up conceiving a guy like Greg.Maybe it was the only way to turn Greg into the victim of both his parents and in-laws, following an unnecessary subplot where Jack suspects Greg to have a child with his former nurse (Alana Urbach), it doesn't quite work, not better than the drugs allegations in the former one. At the end, what is left to enjoy in 'Meet the Fockers' is very communicative performance from Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand and probably, one of the greatest child-acting performances ever, through the cute Little Jack who'd learn one word from Gaylord Focker.Unsurprisingly, at the end, they marry, they celebrate the wedding, everyone's happy, but nothing is much left to enjoy, it's fun, but nothing else. There was a true potential to let the differences between the Byrnes and the Fockers to escalate until the kind of confrontation where even the Fockers would acknowledge some flaws in their education, something that would justify why Greg is so ashamed of them. There could have been a much more hilarious climax (literally) during the massage scene, but instead of having an orgasm, Jack hurts his back again and gets upset.So many wasted opportunities, but well, except for Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand, the film doesn't provide much more originality, except for the funniest part of the film, the opening where everything goes perfectly fine for Greg, from the taxis to the airports, that was a clever way to put some distance from the original one, a pity that the rest didn't match it. But I guess the first opus' success asked for a sequel, even with declining quality. Did I mention 'Little Jack'? Yeah? So I guess it's time to conclude this review..",7,0,0,13 January 2014
Man on the Moon," A movie that interestingly works 'despite itself' ...
","When it comes to misunderstood geniuses or irreverent entertainers, Milos Forman is not the least interesting director for the biopic genre. So, when he's the one who handles the film relating the life and death of one of the most brilliant and misunderstood comedians of his generation: Andy Kauffman, portrayed by THE greatest comic star of his generation : Jim Carrey, it can't get more promising than that. The result turns out to be a very good film, with a little something that could have made it better.I think that 'little something' is easily diagnosable and is to blame on the director, because basically, the movie lacked a direction. It's interesting that Milos Forman, an international film-maker -well, at least in his sensitivity- decided to make a film about an American TV and stage icon, someone whom a majority of people, even American, wouldn't be automatically familiar with. Think about this, Mozart was an artist with an undeniable universal appeal, and even to those who didn't necessarily love classical music, 'Amadeus' worked as an extraordinary depiction of the poisoning effect of jealousy in the envious mind. 'The People vs Larry Flynt' involves a universe even more marginal but despite its sleaziest undertones, the films worked as an inspired pamphlet against censorship and any form of closed-minded bigotry.And this is how a biopic should work, in my humble opinion, you don't necessarily need a famous character, but you cleverly use his life, his personality as an excuse to speak much larger statement about human nature, I mentioned 'Larry Flynt' when I could have evoked 'Chariots of Fire' or 'Gandhi'. OR the movie should plunge us in the darkest depths of human nature, and enlighten us on the soul's mechanism that can inspire a particular behavior that would influence a certain field, 'Amadeus' is one of them, but also 'Ed Wood'. And there is a virtuous effect on these two distinct approaches: when you transcend your character, you invite the viewer to question his own sensitivity and when you dig into your character's sensitivity, you invite the viewer to transcend his own perception of life. These are the two directions of a good biopic, higher or deeper. I'm afraid the direction of 'Man of the Moon' is too 'linear'.Exactly what is Andy Kaufman's appeal for someone who's never heard of him or never seen any of his skits even knowing his name? In its essence, 'Man on the Moon' is trapped in its own concept. I didn't watch the film as a fan of Kaufman, which I can't be, because I've never seen any of his acts, not even as a fan of Carrey, but as a fan of Forman whom I was sure, was going to make either a great film about the inner mechanisms of humor or a much greater depiction of the world of entertainment, like Bob Fosse's masterpiece 'Lenny' who was also about a comedian I wasn't familiar with. But it turned out to really be about Kaufman, well, I wasn't cheated but I felt a little deceived. The film is still good, but could it have really been bad since it recreates a succession of life's episodes that are funny or intriguing indeed, with a documentary-like realism? Hence the question, what did I learn exactly that I couldn't have learned from a documentary? I feel guilty by writing these lines because overall, I enjoyed the film, hell, I can't even get the great drums moment and the catchy 'Abudabi' song off my head, the film needed more moments like the one in the Carnegie Hall, if not more intellectual, something more entertaining or appealing. But it seemed like it only tried to please people who knew about Kaufman and wanted to revive his short but brilliant career, a sort of sympathetic tribute from the buddies. Okay, but the material had so much potential, Jim Carrey's performance was full of energy and poignant vulnerability and I appreciated Danny De Vito as Shapiro, his manager, and Paul Giamatti as his buddy and co-writer. The style, if we could even speak of style, of Andy Kaufman was an excellent demonstration of the power of humor, and how you can develop some comic avant-guardism out of it. And the more I got used to the awkwardness of Kaufman, the more I expected hints if not answers, why did he do that? Why did people relate or not to that form of humor? Maybe the film's alibi is that it tried to play as a self-reflexive portrayal of Kaufman's style. Why should I expect some deep meaning from a film about a comic who didn't even expect laughs. Sure. But Kaufman, from what I understood, loathed indifference, and wanted to be either loved or hated, at least inspire a specific reaction from his audience, 'boos' or 'cheers' but never silence or 'meh?'. And what made the character so interesting is the way he seemed to be also insecure with compliments and cheers, as if he felt that the path to reach the comedic talent, never passed by cheap laughs, or classic styles, another reason why he detested sitcoms, with its prefabricated laughs. He was indeed ahead of his time.Buy why was he like this? We'll never know, and we all have to take his personality for granted. I'm not quite sure about the self-reflexive approach, because the film is not that subtle, I wouldn't have minded if it was longer enough to avoid the brutal ellipse from his childhood to his first act on stage, or show how Courtney fell in Love with him. Nor would I have minded if the film avoided some unnecessary gory parts that really didn't belong to the film.The strength of 'Man on the Moon' is that there is an inner fascinating charisma inhabiting the main character, and in a way the movie succeeded thanks to Kaufman's aura and despite the direction.",7,0,0,26 September 2011
The Princess Bride," A film to share with your kids like the grandfather did with the book ...
","It is not surprising that Rob Reiner chose to narrate 'The Princess Bride' from the frame story of a grandfather (Peter Falk) reading a book to his sick grandson (Fred Savage). The film is a fairy tale written by an adult who understood children, not any children, but modern children impregnated with action films and video games, who would more likely open their minds to thrilling sword-fights and adventures than anything involving 'a lot of kissing'.Reiner amusingly punctuates the story with the kid's reaction as to reassure the most skeptical of us that this won't be your typical 'fairy tale' fantasy. And rightfully so because the overture would hardly make kids lower their guard, the film starts with a (typical) love story between the beautiful Buttercup (Robyn Wright) and her servant Wesley (Cary Elwes). Wesley obeys every demand with an enamored 'as you wish', until Buttercup realizes she loves him too, and the film hasn't make it to the fifth minute before the two leads embrace in land of Florin's bucolic landscape.The signature shot of 'The Princess Bride' cuts immediately to the kid who can't listen anymore to that cutesy stuff, and at this time, Reiner got us, and by us, I mean, children and adults, the audience is relieved to see that the emotion shared by the listener is taken into consideration, and will work as the premise to a whole other material. I remember very well, the first time I saw the film, on 7th grade class, we were all 12 or 13-year old preteens and our teacher used the film to illustrate the value of 'narrative structure', we were all, 'what the hell is that?' until that immediate reaction, and the story could finally pick up.Wesley leaves the country to get rich and marry Buttercup but he's taken by Dread Pirate Roberts, known for never leaving anyone alive. Buttercup, out of despair, agrees to marry Prince Humperdinck (Chris Sarandon) but she's kidnapped by three eccentric outlaws whose different frames works like a comic-book gag. There's Vizzini, the Sicilian boss, played by a cunning and detestable Wallace Shawn, Inigo Monotoya (Mandy Patinkin) as the skilled swordsman and Fezzik, played by champion wrestling Andre the Giant who doesn't seem to carry the symptoms of gentleness  not yet. They take the Princess offshore, followed by a masked stranger who seems to be Private Roberts and Prince Humperdinck and his men.When the film was screened, the teacher referred to many scenes as parodies : the Screaming Eels were an imitation of 'Jaws', the investigating styles of Prince Humperdinck were borrowed from Sherlock Holmes, the masked estranger combined with Montoya's Spanish accent made Zorro, and so on and so forth. 'The Princess Bride' could easily be labeled as a parody, feeling and talking like one, but I'm positive that the film isn't as much a parody as it's a fairy tale, in fact, it deliberately floats between these two levels, making possible to touch your heart with a genuine innocence, not incompatible with its sharp wit.And this is another power of the film, it takes some distance from Disney-like stuff without turning it into derision either, it's like a wink to the audience with a friendly tap on the shoulder. The story presents a series of adventures where we discover that there are more than simple characters in the film: Montoya plans to kill the six-fingered man who killed his father, he's already prepared his speech and naturally, with the repeated 'Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die', everyone cheered in the classroom, not to mention the last quote before the final slay. After triumphing over Montoya and Fezzik, there's also an unforgettable duel of spirits with Vizzini whose outcome is not only unpredictable but cynically hilarious.The film is full of eccentric characters that all have their shining moments. It also reminded me of these Grimm fairy tales we read on 11th grade, where everyone served a purpose, the villains, the antagonists, sometimes a place like the Forest with the fire spouts, lightning sand, and Rodents of Unusual Size, the helpers, like an unrecognizable Billy Crystal and Carol Kane, as Mr and Mrs. Miracle Max who'll resurrect the hero and allow the film to conclude on a satisfying way. And there's the eternal idea that brains triumph over brawn have and the way, Wesley defeats Count Humperdinck (Sarandon is excellent!) is also funny and original at the same time.The film has the wit and fun of Rob Reiner's 'Spinal Tap' but it ends with the same bittersweet melancholy than his 'Stand by Me', when after the excitement, we're left with the feeling to have witnessed something so miraculously sweet and tender, (the music helps and the 'Storybook Love' enhance that emotionality) that we've had our share of thrills or fun and we're not that reluctant to have a final kiss at the end. The grandfather closes the book before the kissing, but the kid's reaction again matches ours  the film is one beautiful romance and deserves a romantic finale, we wouldn't have accept it from a spoof, but if it was one, the film wouldn't have been this endearing and so lovable classic.'The Princess Bride' is a timeless classic full of unforgettable characters, a sweet thought to the late Andre the Giant who marked forever Cinema with his giant footprint, and unforgettable quotes. The grandfather couldn't give a more appropriate answer than his 'as you wish' when his grandson asked him to tell him the story again the day after. And like the book, the film can be seen over and over and I'm looking forward to show it to my little girl when she'll be old enough to appreciate it, hoping that her generation wouldn't be made of children reluctant to watch such a cinematic treasure.",8,2,4,24 December 2013
Saving Private Ryan," Many elements of greatness don't necessarily make a great movie ...
","'Great' is such a big word, you can fill it with so many expressions like spectacular, thrilling, heart-breaking, gut-wrenching, emotional, inspirational etc. etc. My problem with 'Saving Private Ryan' is that it has all these elements but still ... at the end, I have a big feeling of 'emptiness', it's like all these things cancel each other out.The opening sequence is one of the most spectacular you'll ever see in a War movie, Spielberg knows how to deal with visual effects and the sound editing, the shaky movements of the camera gives a realistic depiction of the chaos dominating these battles, even the word 'battle' is too feeble to describe the intensity of the massacre. The sky is gray on this D-Day, the sea is reddened by the sacrifice of these young soldiers, the air is a vicious enemy that can send you a bullet where it feels like to. Your life is as worthless as money in a lottery. Indeed this opening sequence was very promising, but I had mixed feelings after. I hoped the movie would stay in the same level of realism and greatness on one side. On the other side, I wished it wouldn't contain other sickeningly violent sequences. Unfortunately, none of these wishes were satisfied.The film flirts with fantasy right after the battle sequence, where the mission of Captain Miller's men is finally exposed. They will have to save one soldier, Private Ryan, the only one left to a family who already lost 3 sons, his brothers. To spare a tragedy for one soldier's family, eight of them will try to find him and risk their lives. We don't know this Ryan yet, he's only a name, a quest, but we get used to these characters, we follow them and have sympathy for them, but at each step of their odyssey, one will be killed. It becomes almost a routine. We're not supposed to think of their family, or the loss caused by this mission. They just die and the mission must go on. It seems that Ryan's life has more value. At this point, I remember 'Schindler's List' beautiful statement 'Whoever saves one life, saves the humanity' but the people who were saved, didn't choose their destiny, they were victims, the alternative was death. Ryan wanted to be a soldier, to fight, he never wanted to be saved, isn't the movie about duty, wasn't Ryan accomplishing his? So what's the point of risking the lives of soldiers who want to fight instead of looking for a man who's not a prisoner, to save one who didn't ask for it. Nonsense, and dangerous reasoning implying that some 'external' elements make your life more valuable than the others.Which in fact, brings me to the biggest problem I had with the film. Life's value. The movies tries to be inspiring by making these soldiers heroes, but to make them heroes, it creates villains by totally dehumanizing the enemy, when a War movie makes me cheer for one human being killed, I feel manipulated, and I become distant ... when a coward like Upham becomes Rambo at the end, and when Steamboat Willie revealed himself as the sneaky bastard they thought he was ... I said, okay, Spieleberg is pushing the Manichean button a little too far. Of course, when you consider the atrocities committed by the enemy, it's impossible to root for the soldiers equally, but that's the challenge when you make a war movie, you can make a Manichean blockbuster (easy choice) or a disturbing masterpiece (challenge) ... I disliked 'Saving Private Ryan' for the same reason I loved 'All Quiet on the Western Front', 'Paths of Glory', 'Apocalypse Now', 'Platoon' or 'Das Boot'.This movie is great in all the meanings of the word and that's the problem, it's 'too great', it tries too much ... I loved the opening scene, and another one will torture me forever, it's the scene where Melish begs for his life when he lost the fight, that part killed me ... it felt so real, I couldn't breath ... literally. To conclude, a solid block-buster movie with some unforgettable scenes but not the inspirational masterpiece they claim it to be.",6,5,10,15 November 2010
The Chorus," Proof that Music is indeed the most beautiful and universal language ...
","'The Chorus' has something special that miraculously cuts straight to your heart, whatever it is doesn't belong to our cynical days. But the 'miraculously' word is less a praise than a simple recognition of value. 'Amelie' for instance, is a far superior film in my opinion because at least, it had the merit to be original, something that cruelly lacks in 'The Chorus'. I almost blame myself for being so familiar with 'Goodbye, Mr. Chips', 'Blackboard Jungle', 'To Sir With Love' or 'Dead Poets Society', the theme of the schoolteacher struggling with rebellious pupils and then helping them to find a meaning to their lives is so old that I wonder how Christophe Barratier got away with this from the French critics' circle. Roger Ebert was less magnanimous in his review.I reckon Ebert was about to convince me, just before I started to question my criticism. After all, even the most unoriginal plot can make a creative and surprising film. Moreover, Barratier, the director never denied that the film was an adaptation of a forgotten 1945 classic named 'A Cage of Nightingales', which basically uses the same plot. Christophe Barratier was so touched by the story that he felt it deserved to be known by the 2000's audience. And thankfully, he didn't kill off the charm by setting the film in a more recent context, and consequently being very careful about the use of this or that minority not to inspire the same kind of negative reactions 'Amelie' faced. 'The Chorus' is a film set in the France of 1949, a totally different country who was still healing its wounds from WWII. And in the France of 2004, as it often happens in this country so thirsty of intellectual discussions, the film opened the door to an unexpected wave of nostalgia towards these days where discipline and authority was the daily bread of pupils, whose childhood took its full meaning because it was not spoiled yet by technology. Kids had to learn about respect, yes, but they had the freedom to play with what was at their hands without TV, without the Internet. Tougher times but so much more appealing, and maybe that's why parents and kids both loved the film, and why it became a subject of many social debates highlighting the reality that discipline and authority were still relevant today.'The Chorus' was a phenomenon, released at a time where the audience was probably tired of having so many French thrillers emulating American films with a certain level of violence and spectacular scenes that didn't fool anyone. It touched a sensitive chord in France, then Europe and even across the Atlantic, because of the universality of its subject. We all had a teacher who inspired us, and the film is a tribute to this optimism that inhabits childhood, this idea that anything is possible, and that it is never too late to find a meaning to your life. Still, the 'miraculously' word is not about the elements I just described, it's something more than that, something transported by a series of unreadable signs translated by the most beautiful and universal human language. That is the real secret of 'The Chorus': the music. It's so magnificently composed and written that it succeeds precisely where others cinematic elements don't. Indeed, the same story with the same actors, director and characters wouldn't have such a great phenomenon without that music. I can't describe how the melody of 'Look to your Path' affected me, and the people in the theater. That's the power of the film, as it brilliantly embodies the magical power of Music, this capability to let yourself escape from your condition, and open the windows of your heart to an infinite road made of dreams, projects and inspirations  the film is about hope, optimism, life and this is what the music, hence 'The Chorus' is about.The music works as an antidote to all the cold intellectual approach that would point its finger on the unoriginality of the plot. Yes, we know that Clément Mathieu (Gérard Jugnot), the underdog and not pleasant-looking music teacher will succeed, yes, the way the kids turn from average singers to a talented choir, flirts sometimes with cinematic fantasy. Yes, we know what will happen to Pierre Morhange (Jean-Baptiste Maunier). But it's like the film embodies itself the touching naivety of childhood incarnated by the cute little face of Pépineau when he says he doesn't know any song, with his nose cutely moving. Okay, we wise guys, have seen many films like this, but how about the others, how about kids? Should our cinematic knowledge always undermine our appreciation? Should we always blame a film for being manipulative even if it manipulates us to something undeniably positive?So, I'll give it a 9, not because of the predictability of the plot, but just for some little flaws in the writing that could have been avoided. How couldn't the older Morhange remember the name of the man who changed his life, for the best? Why trying to depict these kids as incarnation of the devils where they are not (after all, Mr. Chips' kids were not all bratty)? Why making such a despicable character out of Rachin, the headmaster, especially after depicting him in a lighter way just before? The movie needed an unlikable bossy civil servant but not an evil man. And last but not least, in the farewell scene, why didn't Mathieu take all the sheets that went sent to him? There are many interrogations left but these ones still bug me whenever I watch 'The Chorus'.Still, it's indeed one of the most memorable films of the 2000's, that anyone from any country would love, English, American, French? Forget about it, the movie speaks the most universal language, I mean  it sings it.",9,1,1,12 November 2011
The Pianist," Less 'cinematic' yet more affecting than 'Schindler's List' ...
","To think that I avoided 'The Pianist' for about 10 years because I expected a new 'Schindler's List'! And I don't even mean that negatively.I've watched Spielberg's film several times and know too well how painful Holocaust movies are, and while 'Life is Beautiful' was a tragicomic fable and 'Sophie's Choice' more of a character study relating a traumatic experience, I knew 'The Pianist' would be on the same level of ambition and seriousness than Spielberg's film, if only because it was directed by Roman Polanski, a Holocaust survivor himself. I knew the movie would feature shocking arbitrary executions and poignant separations, so in a way, 'The Pianist' was already having an impact on me without watching it. But this is not the only reason why I didn't feel the urge to watch it.Part of the blame is to be put on the film itself although it was inevitably going to be compared with its 'glorious' predecessor. Speaking of my own experience, I was mislead by 'The Pianist' and the movie trailers. I thought it was the story of a man who played music for the Nazis and his survival, and therefore found in the present's horror and gloominess a heaven of escapism in the inner, universal and timeless beauty of music. Wladislaw would have the state of mind of one of Schindler's factory workers with music as the same weapon as Guido's humor and optimism in 'Life is Beautiful'. Of course, I realize now how my preconceived ideas totally underestimated Roman Polanski and I hope this review redeems my 10 years of abstinence.First, one must give to Spielberg what is Spielberg's and to Polanski what is Polanski's. 'Schindler's List' is a better directed film but 'The Pianist' is a better told story. And while the directing of Spielberg betrays sometimes the harshness of its subject by too much 'mise en scene', Polanski's ability to hook our hearts to the fate of Wladislaw Spillman, magnificently portrayed by Adrien Brody, and his family is beyond words. Indeed, we feel like part of this family. While the epic scope of 'Schindler's List' provided a sort of moral aura to the victims, making the film a martyrdom's remembrance, 'The Pianist' is simply the chronicles of a banal horror. And Polanski keeps an intimate, almost unnoticeable directing, to better convey the feeling that we're watching normal people whose lives are dramatically affected by an absurd War, and it's their very normality that emphasizes the cruelty of the Nazi treatment.The film opens in Warsaw in September 1939 so those with a minimum of historical knowledge understand the implication. Wladislaw is playing Chopin in a studio when the first German bombings are heard, his family wants to leave but later, they learn in the radio that France and Britain entered the War. Relieved, they celebrate the news with a toast, and the relatively cheerful ambiance contrasts with the usual demonstrations of grief and pain. Of course, we know the worst is to come, but Polanski takes his time to get us immersed in the war's ambiance and letting us observe the progressive decline of the Spillmans, directly mirroring the atmosphere that probably prevailed within all the Jewish families.Through the Spillman's perspectives, we get a more accurate idea of the nightmare endured by Polish Jews. When they're all parked in the Warsaw ghetto, before the inevitable evacuation, we witness gut-wrenching, intolerable, and acts of brutality, so unbelievably gratuitous and horrific, we never doubt that they're based on true stories, and that war, definitely, inspires the worst from humanity. In war, there's no room for dignity, for charity, for understanding, for God I would even say. As for violence, there is no scale, soldiers throwing off a balcony an old grandfather on a wheelchair because he couldn't stand is a horrifying sight, but maybe I expected these kind of moments so much that I was more shocked by the part where the soldiers made people dance together. Sometimes, humiliations are more impacting than random and arbitrary killings.And again, the talent of Polanski is precisely not to have overplayed on the directing department: no 'Black and White', no special effects, no 'little girl in Red', just basic colors, as to sustain the feeling of a present, more real then more horrific. 'Schindler's List' might be a better film for some, but it's still a film, while 'The Pianist' is a survival story, raw and real. Not a hero, not a victim either, the main protagonist will sometimes count on his courage, sometimes on his good luck, sometimes on the help of good-hearted and understanding people, from any sides. There is a light of hope in the film, through music, at a time where humanity reached its lowest point, music was here to remind people, to remind Nazis what a waste the War was, a feeling incarnated by Adrien Brody's sad-looking eyes.Again, don't expect a hero à la Oskar Schindler in Wladislaw, 'The Pianist' shows the boldness of a period where cowardice was sometimes guided by survival instinct, where the desire to live could be more necessary than the desire to fight, because surviving left more voices to speak about the atrocities. 'The Pianist' reveals those hidden subtleties that couldn't be truly expressed in epic movies. Some Jews didn't fight back precisely because the horrors of Auschwitz, Treblinka, Buchenwald had to be known, and ironically, this was one of the reasons that accelerated the exterminations' process. And some like Wladislaw had to hide not to make the sacrifices of the others unnecessary, those were tough times and no one is allowed to put a judgment... not us, anyway.And this is why 'The Pianist' is more affecting than 'Schindler's List', and if one has any doubt, let's not forget, that Spielberg was born in 1946 while Roman Polanski is still a war survivor who lost his mother in a Death Camp.",10,4,6,1 June 2012
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Tricks and Treats...
","In a fictional country whose name might earn 100 points on the Scrabble, one of these typical points in the map that started the century in the Austrian-Hungarian splendor and ended up in Soviet austerity, there is a hotel. In this hotel that used to be the place-to-be to all the visitors from Europe, there was a professional, no-nonsense but not without a debonair quality of his own, concierge, his name was Gustav. He had a lust for aging blonde socialites, and from the way he explains it, it's something that requires the taste of a gourmet.There's also a timid but motivated lobby boy named Zero, a baker named Mendl, a murder, a jail sentence, inheritance, family plots and many other ingredients of a real pastry of movie whose story and tone will get over the heads of those who expect something with a plot. Well, that's not what the film is about, it has the old-fashioned charm of Golden Age Hollywood movies, but with a sense of self-conscious wit that gives it a modern touch of originality. It is weird, it is old, you wouldn't believe this is a 2014 movie but like Gustav' tastes, it takes a gourmet to appreciate it.There's something delightfully refreshing in 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' in the way it doesn't call for any particular analysis, and provides nothing that can encourage your mind to venture into intellectual considerations. This film is meant for pure visual and narrative entertainment and all you have to do is imagining yourself checking in a hotel where all your wishes will be granted, you don't even have to think, it's all in the 'wait and see' premise.There's also a leitmotif in the film consisting on a delicious pastry, from renowned baker Mendl, who looks and tastes good and is so appealing in any way that when it is sent to a jail pensioner, the man in charge of checking if there's no outbreak device hidden in food, doesn't even let his butcher knife spoil the visuals. This is almost a metaphor to Wes Anderson's aesthetic power, one you don't want to butcher with 'thinking'. You don't need and you shouldn't, because if you try, you're likely to find yourself in some sort of private joke you're the only one not to get.So, embrace that big joke of a film, that shaggy-dog story where each shot, looks like the vignette of a comic-book, enjoy the dry with of Ralph Fiennes in his greatest comedic performance since 'In Bruges' and don't take the whole thing seriously. The only serious aspect about it is that the film is a visual masterpiece with a unique use of colors, contrasts and environment shots, Anderson is a director, who like Jeunet in 'Amélie' knows how to make people move in an environment, whether a hotel lobby, a jail or a mountain. Actually, he even know how to make them static, in the middle of a frame, looking at the camera but never breaking the fourth wall, quite a stunt, really.Other moments come in mind, an exchange of punches that look like the frame never moves yet three or four guys end up on the floor, there's a suspenseful moment over a ravine where a man breaks the ice to make Gustav fall only to be thrown away and fall while spinning like in a Tex Avery cartoon. The juxtapositions between shots is another trick cherished by Anderson, a group of escaping prisoners look down over a hole they just opened, the next shot features the exact opposite with guards. I mentioned comic-books, the film's story board would have made a terrific one. The uses of costume is another aspect that immediately associates the film with the animated world, nothing is too wacky or over-the-top if it means a great-looking shot or a hilarious gag, or both.The film is also known for his ensemble star-cast and indeed, it's part of the publicity, it would take a whole paragraph to list all the actors, but the thing is that the film owes them nothing, they're giving their best shot even for a few minutes of screen-time (Bill Murray doesn't have more than a minute but he steals that minute) because they know the film is good enough to have fun with it. It was Ebert who mentioned in his show with Siskel that there was nothing better than seeing actors having fun with their characters, the film would highlight that 'fun' aspect. We know actors love rely on disguises, phony accents and go beyond their usual method acting just to make fun of their own shtick. That's how refreshing the tone of Anderson is. The film would garner 11 Oscar nominations, the most with 'Birdman' but not one for acting. Fair enough.And as star-studded as it is, Anderson was wise enough to cast a relatively unknown young fellow (Tony Rivelori) for the central role of awkward lobby boy Zero (his old counterpart is played by F. Murray Abraham), Zero doesn't have any physical appeal, he's not even competent, but he's totally devoted to his Master Gustav and that is the key to their relationship, he's his eyes and ears during his absence in prison and together, they lead a heart-pounding adventure with the dawn of the War as a backdrop. Their relationship, which is one of the mentor and master can be very inspiring at time, even poignant, so maybe there are a few things to appreciate beyond the zaniness, after all.But apart from that, it's a film that can be tasted like a treat and full of tricks whose only purpose is to make you laugh, the whole thing wrapped up in a sumptuous visual package à la Anderson, a cinematic Mendl. 'The Grand Budapest' is all about intellectual detachment, visual entertainment, and fun, fun and fun, tricks and treats, really.",9,3,4,12 June 2017
The Favourite," Okay, this calls for another kind of reviewing, doesn't it?
","I guess I went through as many stages of appreciation as acid pills taken during the making. Did they try to make a punk version of 'Dangerous Liaisons' or was the director channelling Darren Aronofsky making 'The Madness of Queen Anne', I can't articulate my feelings in order to form a general appreciation, not now anyway. I have to enumerate all my key-reactions in chronological order.1st minute:. It's got quite a nice look, the costumes are all right. I know like period movies, I like 18th century, Barry Lyndon, The Duchess, and all that. I think I'm gonna like thi.1st minute 10 seconds: I'm suddenly not so 100% sure that it's gonna be your average costume movie. I should have figured that with the credits and titles' display.2nd minute: what's with my camera-lens trick? Another 'And Now For Something's Completely Different' moment and I'll be groaning.10 minutes: (groaning)15 minutes: feeling like that judge in the trial films: 'this is better getting somewhere'....25 minutes: the slap! finally, this got somewhere after all. Cool I waited for it.My faith is restored.
25 minutes, 10 seconds: Not so fast. Never mind the profanity but I didn't know the term 'OK' was used in the 18th century England.
25 minutes, 20 seconds: playing with the wheelchair... what the bloody hell?!
25 minutes, 30 seconds: OK, they might as well kiss each other, nothing will surprise me...
25 minutes, 45 seconds: What did I say?!30 minutes: at that point, I would see Weisz sticking her booger on a Stone's face, I wouldn't be surprised, seems like randomness is mistaken for pointlessness, or is it the other way around, I don't think I care anymore ... my brain is telling me 'Mama, I wanna go home!'40 minutes: OK, characters are well-established, Im getting used to the overall iconoclast tone and there were a few genuinely good parts (even genius at time) and the acting is truly Oscar-worthy..1hour 20 minutes: OK if I forget about that naked man with the tomatoes thrown at his body, we've had almost an hour of cinematic consistency where I could appreciate better the performances of both Stone, Weisz and understand why Colman is credited as the lead.1hour 40 minutes: my mind is processing, is it supposed to say something about women in power or the different layers of power with the favorite playing like consiglieri, is it about women power or just the way power corrupts everyone so there's no reason for women to be least corruptible... or maybe we have just a fantastic duel between two rivals who want to be the one who pulls the strings even if it means strangling the other with them. Seems like we already have a winner then, right?1hout 55 minutes: that scene is dragging on and on, it'd be better be the ending... oh so it's finished. She did win but was it the 'she' I expected? not really. Well, the film outgrew its initial bizarreness, was consistently interesting, made me think and had a satisfying ending. I can see the hype was somewhat deserved after all. But I can't say I had an instant liking, it's really demanding in terms of patience but maybe it's a film that takes time to grow on you.Not for any taste or audience, but definitely a memorable experience, and so unpleasant at times you've got to admire its daringness, you can say it's over-stylized but that's the kind of thing you say about film that are all flash and no substance, this one has both and sometimes, flash and substance act like the two favourites in the film. And the story oddly enough acts like the Queen, it looks weak, flawed and flobby but it' got more strength inside and more personality than you'd think.8 seems like the right rating, but it was a close call.",8,3,6,10 February 2019
Revolutionary Road," The Bored Office Worker and the Desperate Housewife...
","If you don't know it from experience, you know from movies that marriage isn't all it's cracked up to be. I used to fill the ranks of optimists who saw it as a whitewater rafting with a few rapids to ride when it's closer to drifting across an ocean of routine, punctuated by loud hurtful arguments and a few tender 'sorry' or 'I love you' to conceal the wounds. Films are never as haunting as when they reflect the turbulence of your own life. And watching Sam Mendes' 'Revolutionary Road' was like a slap from my mirror.Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet are Frank and April Wheeler, young, loving and good-looking. They share everything: car, bed, house, lawns and kids to play in, but in their lucid moments, they realize their solitude. In a spectacularly directed scene, a wave of men with gray flannel suits are literally spreading over New York streets, The Knox building exudes some Billy Wilder's Apartment' vibes while the crowd shots gives the film a surrealistic touch, channeling the famous Magritte painting with the men with bowler hats. Frank is like a lemming caught in a crowd and about to accomplish his daily suicide over the cliff, he sits down in his cubicle and can only gets his kicks by acting like a 'big shot' in front of an easily impressionable secretary.April can breathe fresh air every day, but with the fathers at work and kids at school, suburbs look like ghost towns, a feeling of total emptiness is inevitable and ends up invading April. Frank is a face in a crowd who doesn't have time, April has time and space but she's tied to Frank. Both are married but terribly alone. Now, loneliness can be a door for as many rooms as opportunities, but in marriage, the door is locked and you're trapped in one room: marital, existential dead-end.April dreamed to be an actress but in the 50's, Hollywood was like TV, many called and few chosen. The film opens with a flop that draw the curtain on her dreams and after many attempts to consulate her, Frank finally lets this out and invites her to abandon this 'theatre' nonsense.The couple buys a nice suburban house in 'Revolutionary Road', their real estate agent, played by Kathy Bates who, have found the perfect house for the perfect postcard-couple. But we know what that facade of happiness can hide the ugliest realities. Sam Mendes made the great 'American Beauty', a social commentary about the suburban American life, made of ersatz of contentment and where families could only lead carbon-copy lives dictated by consumerism and pretending to have a 'normal' life because they're too afraid to question the norm. But we're no fools, we see these men and women talking about kids, eating, sleeping or having sex but they're only making an effort to hide their disillusions.In 'Revolutionary Road', the roles are reversed, it is April, who suggests Frank to abandon everything and go to Paris, she'll find a job in the Embassy and he'll have time to figure out what he wants to do. Frank is tempted to a certain degree: he knows he has no talent, the only certitude is that he hates his job, that meaningless job he can't even explain in proper words, that sucked the life out of his father, making him swear to himself he'd never fall in the same death trap. But as a coach told me once, we're sometimes better than we think at things we hate, and Karma plays quite a trick on him by giving him a raise and a promotion. Frank is like a Lester Burnham in terms of awareness but not in the action and this is where 'Revolutionary Road' stands out among the other marriage movies, this is one about inaction rather than action.Indeed, it is about a wife who wants to go to Paris without a plan, and a man who can't because he's scared, they know what they hate and they share the same hatred, but there's a crucial difference: April won't go to Paris to be happy, she'll be happy if she goes to Paris, Frank anticipates and thinks the remedy is worse than the disease, he can't see that his wife gave him a tacit ultimatum, she reached the existential dead-end before him. It is very appropriate that the only person in the movie to tell the truth and to make sense is an insane man played by Michael Shannon. He can see the gateway to escape from the inconvenient truth, and sweeps off Frank's justification with a cruel verdict: 'you deserve each other'.They know he's right but can't admit, and that's the terrible truth of marriage: it forces you to keep silent. The ending left me puzzled what's with that old man listening while his wife was babbling, but then I realized it wasn't random; the point was that many marriages looked exactly the same, forcing people to pretend to live happy. In the 50's, the American family model was the norm but looking at the way people smoked and drank and had affairs with their secretaries or neighbors, you realize that not much have changed, today, it's porn and Internet. The cures changed not the symptoms.'Revolutionary Road' is more relevant than ever, it speaks devastating truths about bored office workers and desperate housewives, and as someone who actually followed his wife to a 'Paris' scenario, let me tell you that it didn't work either, I'm still figuring out what I'm made for and life is still routinely. So I can say that April and Frank were doomed from the start, and the tragedy is that they certainly loved each other.I had just seen 'Romeo and Juliet' recently (and the remake with Leo) and the more marriage movies I watch, the more I wonder if it the play had such a tragic ending after all.",9,0,0,28 March 2017
Lawrence of Arabia," Miraculous
","'Lawrence of Arabia' is a classic among the classics, unanimously praised for its dazzling imagery, haunting music and the hypnotic performance of Peter O'Toole. And how David Lean got the guts to shoot a 4-hour long epic film in the desert, with no female role, no romance whatsoever, with more meditation than sheer action, to create one of the most glorious cinematic experiences is a miracle like only the magic of film-making can provide every once in a while, like 'Gone With the Wind' or 'The Godfather'.As said Roger Ebert in his most interesting review, 'Lawrence of Arabia' is a masterstroke of genius in the way it went against all the movies' conventions for the sake of pure creation. To make his film, Lean had probably to visualize how photogenic would the immensity of the desert be, how a sunset in a red sky would amaze eyes, how the iconic entrance of Omar Sharif as Sheriff Ali would challenge every viewer. And Ebert couldn't have been more accurate because while watching 'Lawrence of Arabia', I couldn't stop imagining the magical effect of these shots in the darkness of a movie theater, seeing this vague little strain in the middle of a mist turning into a thin silhouette until the figure of the black-clad Sheriff Ali emerges on the screen: pure magic Lean trusted both his minds and our eyes. See it's impossible to dissociate 'Lawrence of Arabia' from the sensational experience each frame conveys. And Lean, who had just directed another acclaimed Best Picture winner, 'The Bridge on the River Kwai', handles his material with much more confidence if it was ever needed. Think of the overture in the dark. Imagine yourself sitting in a movie theater and hearing the heart-pounding drums of Maurice Jarre before the violins let escape one of the most iconic movie themes. Imagine your ears transported by this melody, visualizing in the dark, a majestic and frightening sun, an endless desert, a mysterious Oriental Goddess that scares as much as fascinates  after such a set-up, the rest is history and I don't think I would bring anything new to the debate. This is why I want to develop the aspect that can easily get unnoticed in such a grandiose epic: the script.In 'Lawrence of Arabia', the lines flow with the poetry of a Greek tale with some shadowy truths resonating when you put them in historical perspective. T.E. Lawrence was the man who guided the Arab Revolt against the Turkish colonization during World War I. In a way, he embodies this quote from the New Testament: 'No prophet is accepted in his own country', he's not a prophet of course in the literal meaning of the word, but he ignited an extinguished flame, the flame of a pride, distancing himself from the decadence of the British Empire to embrace a romantic cause, romantic because lost. It's not an Englishman leading the Arabs; it's an outcast leading an outcast people. And pay attention, there is this incredible mix of madness and inspiring masochism in the eyes of this man who plays with fire without even minding the pain.O'Toole's eyes are pure and his face like graved in a vivid marble, as if he incarnated heroism in its most classical personification, he speaks the truth and acts according to it. In his first encounter with Sheriff Ali, he delivers an unforgettable and powerful rant: 'So long as the Arabs fight tribe against tribe... so long will they be a little people, a silly people. Greedy, barbarous and cruel, as you are.' These lines still resonate as true and it seems like the Arabs didn't learn from History, earning them one of the worst reputations in all the Western World (not everything is to be blamed on Arabs though, but that's not the point). You can tell in O'Toole's voice that he's sincere and this sincerity is displayed in the next crucial scene when he overtakes his roles and encourages Prince Feisal (Alec Guinness) to fight. The scene features another powerful saying: 'Great things have small beginnings'. This very line echoes another of the film's many extraordinary moments.After having miraculously survived the crossing of the implacable Nefud desert, Lawrence rides his camel back to find a man lost in the Desert and he succeeds off-screen, leading to one of the greatest moments in the film when one of Lawrence's two servants rides his camel toward him, screaming under the triumphant core of Maurice Jarre. This exploits earns him the respect of the Arabs, a people that value bravery. Lawrence becomes 'Awrence, one of them, finally wearing his iconic white suit. His act showed how even the greatest conquest start with an act of brotherly love and solidarity, and the Arabs couldn't defeat the Turks, before defeating their own selfishness and dividing tribalism. The romanticism of the fight scenes and their exhilarating effect on Lawrence who dances his victory on a Turkish train and enjoys the madness of the war contrasts with the pessimism of the end, where the old politicians replace the young warriors.Men like Lawrence would only incarnate dreams, lost in the lies of political calculations, greed, profit and power, condemning the Arabs to fantasize over and over again on Cordoba and its 'two miles of lighting in the streets, when London was a village'. It didn't last as much as Cordoba but Lawrence of Arabia represents a beautifully romantic parenthesis in Arab history that makes the rest of the Century extremely depressing. But given the events of the Arab Spring, the Arabs are conquering their pride back like the Spanish did for Cordoba, there is still a light of hope after all.At least, one of the most revered films in America and most defining of American Cinema would be about the Arabian pride how delightfully ironic!",10,1,3,28 March 2012
City of God," The Brazilian 'Goodfellas' ...
","The opening of 'City of God' is inhabited by a voodoo-like trance, as if the whole spirit of Rio de Janeiro's titular suburbs was translating its turbulent and tortured soul into one of the most thrilling pieces of editing you'll ever see in a film.A chicken is watching a former friend being prepared for meal, someone cuts a carrot, feet in dirty sandals follow the music, and the poor animal is visibly worried watching in live-action its fate to come. But we don't have time to empathize for there is a quick glimpse on the most emblematic character of the film, 'Lil Ze', a sociopath killer, King of the City, who doesn't know yet that his reign is coming to an end. To a certain extent, the chicken mirrors his destiny, a bad omen covered by the frenetic rhythm of the Samba. But as if was applying to itself the city's motto: 'If you run, the beast catches; if you stay, the beast eats' the chicken takes its chance and flees from the human beasts.Meanwhile, 'Rocket' aka Buscape, a honest boy of 'City of God', in other words an outcast, finds himself caught between the chicken and Lil' Ze's gang. He turns back and finds the Police behind him. At this time, the cornered Buscape becomes the chicken, living in microcosm what he's always been: someone with a foot in the criminal world and another one in Civilization, with a befitting profession as a photo-reporter. And he's naturally the narrator, embodying his eternal position as someone active enough to plunge us in the deepest roots of 'Cidade de Deus' and passive enough to stay a witness, a privileged position for the audience, not quite for him  not when we meet him anyway.And in one of the most beautiful ellipses, the director Fernando Reilles takes us back to the 60's, where boys are playing football and when the 'Tender Trio' leads all the criminal activities. At that moment, it's impossible not to connect 'City of God' with another gangster classic. Actually, if there is one film that definitely established the status of 'Goodfellas' as a classic, it is 'City of God', also adapted from a novel, a dramatization of real-life events written by Paulo Lins. But in this Brazilian 'Goodfellas', the protagonist never wanted to be a gangster, Lil' Ze did but his character borrows more from Joe Pesci's character... and calling him a sociopath is an understatement.Indeed, Lil' Ze makes his bones by killing the occupants of a brothel. He was the Trio's lookout and they all agreed not to kill anyone. Visibly, Lil' Ze had other projects and his exhilaration while shooting his first bullets becomes the film's defining picture. One of the trio leaves, one is killed by Lil' Ze. The last one tries to leave but the beast taking the form of police officers catches him  whoever lives by the gun, perishes by the gun. We know that, but nonetheless, there's a sort of idleness and anarchy in these 'favelas' that makes the criminal option almost inevitable. We're far from New York streets, this is not the American Dream, this is Brazil, the white bourgeoisie lives the great life, and Black people are stuck with unemployment and poverty.The temptation of easy money becomes contagious and can even strike the Police. Generally, they don't care much when one of the City dies, and it's only Lil' Ze's outburst against the upper-class that brought their attention. The irony carried by the title is another similarity with 'Goodfellas', if there ever is one absent from this city, it is God. We might be in the grandest Catholic country, people have no more faith in God than they have in Law. Gun and violence are the true assets of power and Lil'Ze understands it. He gets rid of his opponents, consolidates his power, and keeps his childhood friend Benny as a partner and adviser. A new decade, a new generation  sex, drugs and Samba.And for a little while, stability governs the City of God. But the beast never sleeps, it's only taking a break. On his side, Buscape, a wannabe protograph, lives a sweet romance with one of the favela girls, but his incapacity to defend her against the 'Runts', the littlest ones, makes him appear as a weak person, no gangster stuff anyway. So, after the beach incident, the girl loses her interest and falls in love with Benny, the most popular guy around. Later, they want to leave the city to become honest  but a strike of fate reminds us that we can't never leave City of God, as if there was still a sort of moral debt to pay, as if God was still there after all.The action in 'City of God' is fast-paced, the narrative driven by a gallery of unforgettable characters, and with an exciting documentary value to emphasize the social commentary, showing every single detail of the drug-business, gang wars, murders, robberies, rapes, shoot-outs... and naturally, Police corruption. Some scenes are particularly upsetting, the most infamous one shows Lil' Ze assessing his power over the 'Runts' by executing one of them. Some scenes like this are necessary to remind that the first victim of (gang) war is innocence. Meanwhile, Buscape loses his with a journalist and starts as a trainee before we get back to the first scene, culminating with the revenge on the Runts on 'Lil'Ze'.Buscape is confronted to his first professional dilemma : a picture of cops being bribed or Lil' Ze turned into Swiss cheese, his practical choice highlights the fact that he still knows where he comes from, so better to take some precautions. The ending proves him right with the new generation taking the power. Indeed, as long as there are people, there is hope, and when there's no hope, there'll always be crime.",10,2,4,20 February 2014
Cars," Another form of 'existential road movie'...
","There's something very nostalgic in and about 'Cars', starting with its very concept: cars living and behaving like humans, it's a fun idea but not revolutionary. To those who might not be familiar with it, it had already been efficiently used in a Disney cartoon about road rage and a Tex Avery's cartoon about a father whose son dreamed of being race car (ironically, Avery would do a similar cartoon about planes). Now it's one thing to make short cartoons out of such gimmicks but how does that stand for a ninety-minute feature? Well, I guess not so bad when your name is John Lasseter.Still, watching 'Cars', I couldn't tell whether it was the most ludicrous or greatest idea ever, I mean, the universe where the film is set is like a human world as we know it, it has roads (obviously) but also buildings, which leads to the question, who built these buildings? But don't you dare start asking question, if you ask yourself how they make cars, you'll never know if it's on a technical level or if you're a baby car asking your parents. Which leads to the question, yes another, these cars have feelings but how do they express them? Granted Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) falls in love with Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt) but how will that show? I guess we'll have to accept them as asexual characters like Buzz and Jessie are lovers or Buzz and Woody friends, but at least the toys evolved in the real world. Well, I'll stop here, the whole movie wouldn't make sense once you'd put some thought of it, because it's hard to make lives out of mechanical things and the logic of the film is limited by the story itself, but it makes the emotional achievement even more admirable, it's not meant to be 'Finding Nemo' or 'The Incredibles', yet it creates a unique world built on something we love as kids and love even more as adult; cars, so I guess this is why the film was successful enough at the box-office, it hit a sensitive chord. And let's not kid ourselves, from 'Christine' to De Lorean, there's always been a special spot for cars in our heart, we love them and take care of them as if they are 'persons' and if anything 'Cars' exploits this privileged relationship we have with cars, from the toys they were to the big engines they turned into. And as a kid, I had plenty of toys and all from different types, if they were all like Lightning McQueen, it would have been boring but to make up my 'stories', I needed every possible model, I had the fire truck, the old car, the police car, the diversity made the pleasure and accentuate the fun of playing with them, and that's what exudes from John Lasseter's film, it's like big men using cars as props to their stories. In fact, it's like a Toy Story played by grown-ups and it works, You have the introducing and climactic racing, the chases and the adventure in a small town in the desert, that used to be one of the most visited places during the glorious days of Radiator Spings, and this is where McQueen is forced to stay until he destroys the road after being chased by the police car.There, the cocky Flash McQueen meets a gallery of colorful characters, nothing new, the goofy tow truck (Larry the Cable Guy), the Fiat Topolino with the Italian accent, voiced by Tony Shalhoub and the old judge, voiced by Paul Newman and who has enough in common with Lightning to play the role he knows best: the mentor. When you have a former race car champion in a town, it's obvious there will be a few lessons to learn for McQueen before he can 'win' the race. When your hero says that he doesn't need anyone, you know it's a matter of time before he changes his mind, but even when we're fully aware of what's going on, the film manages to drive over these clichÃ©s in a fun and enjoyable way. It's a rather character-driven story and it takes its time to unfold its nostalgic power. I particularly liked the words of Sally about the way the subway ruined everything, and I could relate to it.Many of my dearest childhood memories involves these long travels, and I didn't ask 'are we there yet?' because I knew the places we were going to cross, but we hardly come cross these towns because of the subways. Here's another aspect that will appeal to adults while kids will enjoy the visuals and maybe the story, too. After all, 'Cars', while not a masterpiece, shows you that there are more things to enjoy in cars than moving from a point A to a point B, and that's enough a point to make.",7,0,1,26 October 2016
The Little Mermaid," If greatness was made of waves, 'The Little Mermaid' is a tsunami ...
","'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' was a first step for Disney and a giant leap for animation. No other movie would share the same historical significance, until 1989, the year of 'The Little Mermaid', less a giant leap than a big dive that would splash the audience and create a new wave of animated movies, a new age known now as 'Disney Renaissance'.And 'Renaissance' is the word because it's truly a rebirth of animation after thirty years during which cost-cutting, Xerox processes and images-recycling lowered the very standards of perfectionism that forged Disney's legend. 'Little Mermaid' put an end to that period, starting with the story. Adapted from Hans Christian Andersen's most famous work, it is the first Disney movie based on a fairy tale after 'Sleeping Beauty', 30 years before, which means a whole generation of kids was deprived from princesses and magical stories, and it was time to make a change.A darling for trivia fans, 'The Little Mermaid' is the most expensive Disney movie made after Pinocchio and the first Oscar-nominated one since 'The Rescuers' in 1977. It's also the film that reintroduced a new craving for musicals thanks to the fantastic Calypso numbers lead by Sebastian, the crab maestro, and the unforgettable 'Part of your world'. 'Mermaid' would become the first Disney Golden Globe nominated for Best Musical / Comedy, a feat only surpassed by 'Beauty and the Beast' two years later, not only nominated for a Golden Globe, but also an Oscar for Best Picture. Yet had 'The Little Mermaid' failed at the box-office, we probably wouldn't have 'Beauty and the Beast', 'Aladdin' or 'The Lion King'.But how could 'The Little Mermaid' ever fail? It's infinitely superior to whatever was made after 'Sleeping Beauty', the final masterpiece of an era where Disney had already pushed the envelope. 'One Hundred and One Dalmatians' and its millions of dark spots was still an impressive work but then, 'The Sword and the Stone' started recycling images, and Disney buffs know all about the dancing sequences from 'Robin Hood' and 'The Aristocrats'. Don't get me wrong, Disney never made a really bad film, and my favorite, 'The Jungle Book' happens to be from the 60's. However, as far as animation was concerned, there was no new Disney milestone, and most movies were made of sketchy images and stories lacking that universal appeal.The first serious attempt to recreate the old-school magic was 'The Fox and the Hound' in 1981 but the film had a vague homely feeling that didn't bring the expected amount of escapism, there were no appealing songs and no risky moves à la Mufasa in 'The Lion King'. No matter how good the previous films were, something was missing, songs, animation, escapism, a sense of perfectionism on the form and universal appeal on the content, something that only exotic fairy tales could provide, 'The Little Mermaid' awaited forty years in Disney's drawers, but it was worth it, the film was a tailor-made project to give animation its letters of nobility back. The film's success would multiply by 10 the working staff and would regularly bring home the two Oscars for Best Song and best Score.To think that the Studios were reluctant about including the 'boring' 'Part of your world' or thought about Sebastian as an English butler, see, the film also had that sparkle of luck, projects-that-must-succeed all have. But it's not just luck, animation, music or special effects, the film had to prove its value on the storytelling department and for that, Disney designed one of their most endearing heroines, Princess Ariel, King Triton's youngest daughter, a rebellious red-head without that bankable bad-assness. In Ariel, we have a teenager, to which any kid or adult can relate, with a thirst for discovery and adventures, a hobby (she collects human's items), a dream (to visit land) and a poignant mix of vulnerability and courage. She's not supposed to be a feminist model, but she's not submissive either so whoever finds her desire to change for a man, something insulting, doesn't know the effect love has on someone, regardless of any gender consideration.I had –by the way- a huge crush on Ariel, and on Alyssa Milano from 'Who's the Boss' so I was pleasantly surprised that she was modeled after her, she's simply sublime, and for a Disney heroine, the animators sure knew how to make her look subtly erotic, from my kid's perspective. And a figure like Ariel allows the film to explore so many cherished universal themes : coming-of-age, impossible love and the famous Faustian bargain. Ariel must trade her voice with the devilish Ursula, the octopus-like sea witch, to become a human and be in love with Eric. And what a Divine (from the original model) villain Ursula is. No other villain impacted viewers since 'Maleficent' and 'Cruella', with her body language, her voice and her smile, we wouldn't believe how evil she is, until the exciting and heart-pounding climax where she shows what a larger-than-life villain (literally) she is.'The Little Mermaid' is great on every single department, it's full of colorful and unforgettable creatures, there's also the late Kenneth Mars voicing King Triton, Ariel's patient father, there's the two villainous eels, a buffoonish French cook and there's Sebastian who sings the film's signature songs, 'Under the Sea' that would inspire one of 'The Simpsons' most hilarious musical numbers, and the atmospheric and subtly erotic 'Kiss the Girl', to which I would have given the Oscar. Never had a princess been so expressive with her facial expressions than Ariel in that short segment, more than a plot device, her muteness inspired some of the best drawing from any Disney movie.Thanks for Disney animators for giving another milestone in Disney movies and on its own, all trivia put apart, one of the greatest animated movies and musicals ever.",10,2,3,29 October 2014
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Gracious Butterfly
","If Akira Kurosawa could live for a hundred years, he would have made movies like 'Crouching Tiger and Hidden Dragon', an epic tale of love and duty told with stylish grace and poetry, and a good deal of action sequences, now, that's the most honest and serious compliment I can give to Ang Lee.His film has been regarded as the culmination of 'martial arts' movies but I'm not too hot about this label, because my mind can't help but associate it with Bruce Lee, Van Damme or Jackie Chan's flicks. I'm aware that 'martial arts' is the most popular genre in China or East-Asia in general and is widely associated to plots involving apprenticeship, relationships between masters and disciples, tales of revenges, of good vs. evil and quest for a sacred relics or an inner peace, well, while 'Tiger' does handle these elements, it is beyond genre tagging, it is a film that tackles usual archetypes but with indomitable freedom and a style that can appeal to any movie lover. Still, ever since this film was made, there would be two Lees counting in the legendary scroll of Asian cinema.The film is about two skilled fighters: a master swordsman Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun-fat) and female bodyguard Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) who have in common a precious loss, his former friend he promised to avenge and, her fiancée she promised to love and the same dedication to their duty, that feels like a decoy where they can hide the uncertain feelings toward each other, but that wouldn't fool an unwise eye. Li Mu Bai is instantly recognizable as a heroic figure but when we see him, he's a worn-out man, contemplating his burdens with a tired spirit. To seal this abandon, he decides to give up his sacred sword: 'Green Destiny' and assigns Shu Lien to give it as a present to a friend in Beijing. There she meets Jen Yu, a governor's daughter played by Zhang Ziyi and whose governess (Cheng Pei-Pei) is revealed to be bandit Jade Fox (no spoiler as this comes quite early).The relationships between masters and disciples are vital to the film and they're all ambiguous and enriched with other personal subplots that unfolds like a rose under the sun, Jen Yu is a fiancée but has a lover in an impetuous desert bandit named Lo (Chang Chen) who also have projects for both of them, and Jen Yu remains the real mystery and core of the film, she's the leading role actually. And Ang Lee goes beyond the simplification of having just a hero, a villain and a quest. Anyone is actually a crouching tiger or a hidden dragon for that matter. It takes several viewings to really appreciate this film as you discover each time another layer of the characters' personalities, and it's never done without feeling like a character study, you can discover more about them during a fight, or a stare.Indeed, Asian cinema has this unique capability to be surprisingly quiet in a very heart-pounding way, and the counterpart is that the action sequences, meant to thrill you are hypnotic and you just stare at them as they didn't even belong to the film. 'Tiger' is remembered for the gravity-defying combats where two characters can walk over a wall, jump miles ahead or literally fly over trees and there's never a moment where it feels over the top (no pun intended) or laughable, and that's a credit to the way Lee, surrounded by master visual effects and storytellers, know the audience and is aware that there's nothing as beautiful and dreamy as being able to fly, this is part of human subconscious, this is the ultimate challenge. These scenes have become immediate staples of the art martial genre and parodied everywhere, but even with that in mind, the choreographic battles are impressive.Ebert compared these actions to musical numbers in musicals, they're expected now and then as a relief or a plot punctuation, but I felt they had the same aesthetic value than in Stanley Kubrick's 'Barry Lyndon', where, you forgot you were watching a film and you just admired the beauty of some shots, looking like Rembrandt and Vermer paintings. The beauty of 'Tiger' and the cinematography are simply breathtaking, and it is so contagious that even the characters become part of it. There's a panoramic shot over a long wedding outfit, and it takes as long as it would to show a bamboo tree or a pagoda, but this is the dazzling and beautiful Jen. And then an arrow hits the rickshaw, she raises her curtain and the action starts. There's just something in Lee's directing that shows fighting with art and displays art with the soul of the fighter. Martial Arts came from the Art of War and that's exactly what you get in the film: battles and art.And like for the art, the greatest battles aren't necessarily in forest, arenas or castles under the moonlight but in the mind of tortured characters who are their worst adversaries. It might sound corny but not when Ang Lee is in the command and treats his material with a respect to the audience, one that provided one of the best-looking movies of the 2000's, and as today, the highest-grossing foreign movie of all time.The title comes from Chinese proverb 'Behind the rock in the dark probably hides a tiger, and the coiling giant root resembles a crouching dragon.' Well, I wonder what extraordinary effect this had on audiences sitting in the dark and experience the story told by a director who, on the field of cinematic mastery, is not just a tiger and a dragon, but a butterfly who swings across the breeze with poetic lightness and gracious beauty, defying the wind like Lee did with cinematic conventions.",10,0,0,22 February 2017
JFK," No matter how ugly a truth is, it is never uglier than its absence ...
","On the field of storytelling, 'JFK' reminds of Costa Gavras' 'Z', a political thriller meticulously deconstructing a politician's murder in a fictional Fascist country. Yet it owes more to Akira Kurosawa's 'Rashomon' which presented one reality from as many angles as levels of subjectivity. It's interesting that these films, all one-word titled, were made in the same intervals of time and like 'Rashomon' and 'Z', 'JFK' is less a name than a code that encapsulates behind the mystery and the patriotic mask, a more universal truth about humanity.Still, patriotism is seriously involved and it's very significant that Oliver Stone, one of America's most prolific political film-makers, much more a Vietnam vet, handled the subject of Kennedy's assassination. As a man who practiced America's ideals on a muddy battlefield, Stone is entitled to question these values he fought for and the integrity of the leaders that sent him out there: indeed, why would America send soldiers to fight foreigners in Vietnam? Why so far when Cuba is so close? Money is the key. There are no warmongers but businessmen who generate money out of all the steel, the guns, the helicopters, the machines that are blown to pieces in Asia. In fact, Stone didn't make a Vietnam and a President trilogy but a colossal oeuvre about Politics and War. And to a certain extent, Kennedy can be regarded as one of the Vietnam War's victims, as a collateral damage: he was against the conflict and got killed before putting an end to it. It doesn't point an accusing finger on the Army, but it highlights at least one serious motive for Kennedy's assassination.And that's the essence of the investigation lead by District Attorney Garrison, Kevin Costner at the peak of his bank-ability. Garrison isn't satisfied with the conclusions of the Warren Commission that validated the 'isolated killer' theory, incarnated by Lee Harvey Oswald (a remarkable Gary Oldman) who conveniently died before his trial. What was his motive anyway? The Commission closed the case, leaving a bunch of altered testimonies, witnesses silenced before exposing their truth and so many unanswered questions. Garrison smells something fishy and who wouldn't? And the compass to guide his investigation is the elementary question: who benefits from the crime? And this is where Kennedy's assassination takes a sort of legendary aura, playing as a modern version of Julius Caesar. Kennedy could have made a lot of enemies everywhere: CIA, Russia, Cubans, although I wouldn't regard it as an omission, the film didn't even mention the possibility of an involvement from the Federal Reserve Bank since Kennedy always defended the sovereignty of the dollar. But as the film progresses, it gets clearer that Kennedy was a man to eliminate, and one of 'JFK''s highlights (which is saying a lot) is carried by the revelations delivered by Donald Sutherland as Mr. X, in Washington.There are two levels in 'JFK', the mystery surrounding the murder and the investigation, what happened and what is known. And both interact in a masterstroke of editing, probably one of the most complicated, intricate and brilliant ever committed to screen, certainly a school-case for wannabe editors. Literally, 'JFK' is served like a salad of documents, flashbacks, excerpts from the Zapruder film, archive footage, memories, truths and lies, shot in every possible way (sepia, 16mm, amateur, black and white) and as Roger Ebert pointed out, the film would have been harder to follow with an unchanging shooting. The salad is rich but digestible.And like a 1000-piece puzzle, 'JFK' is an assemblage of different portions of reality that tend to get Garrison, if not closer to the 'final image', further from the Warren's conclusions. On that level, the film provides an extraordinary cast of supporting characters, from Jack Lemmon to Joe Pesci, from Kevin Bacon to John Candy, each one leading to one certainty: there was a conspiracy. The analysis of the Zapruder film revealed the timing between the first and last shot, making implausible the 'one-killer' hypothesis, even if he's a sharpshooter. And this very implausibility implies the presence of a second person, which is enough to validate the idea of a conspiracy.And last but not least, there's the excitability of some interrogated people who know that they put their lives at stakes if they talk. The film is driven by a sense of paranoia that conveys its greatest thrills. What can be more emotionally engaging than a quest for truth anyway, especially when it undermines the deepest beliefs of any good citizen? One of Garrison's employees, played by Michael Rooker, can't accept the possibility of Johnson's involvement, even Garrison's wife (Sissy Spacek) represent this side of America that wants to turn the page. Garrison has detractors and it starts in his own private circle, before he becomes a target for the media.Garrison embodies the struggle of a man who wants to reconcile with America's ideals, he doesn't fight the government because he's against it, but because the government acts against the people. He feels like owing this to Kennedy, to his vision of America, to his sons, and as his investigation goes on, he witnesses the deaths of Martin Luther King, of Bobby Kennedy, and realizes that the system that killed Kennedy still prevails. Garrison's struggle is magnificently conveyed by the sort of inspirational score that only John Williams could have performed.'JFK' works on every cinematic level, it's one of the best political films and best conspiracy movies ever made because it doesn't try to tell its own truth but to belie a fallacious version. It starts with an axiom: there was a conspiracy, and as long as it won't be solved, there's an emotional wound in America's heart that would never be healed.",10,54,72,18 September 2012
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," The appeal of Quentin Tarantino: a tale of triangular fetishism...
","'We' all anticipate the next Tarantino movie, like Scorsese and not so long ago Woody Allen. A Tarantino film is an event by itself: casting, trailers, ads, interviews attract us like candies to window-shopping eyes and our reaction is always the same 'it's gonna be great'.Who's 'we'? Maybe a generic term for movie fans who respect directors that don't try to make tear-jerkers, crowd-pleasers or Academy boot-kissers, Tarantino makes the movies HE likes and that's his trick: he belongs to a certain breed of directors who make their fans believe they also belong to a certain breed of 'connaisseurs', an auteur without the pompous undertones. And the more polarizing he gets, the more exhilarating it is to belong to that little team of aficionados.But why do 'we' dig a director whose chief inspiration is camp and nostalgia?Think about it, most of us appreciate good films, adore masterpieces and enjoy a few guilty pleasures, but if we had a choice between a Wilder or a Hitchcock classic and some badly-dubbed Kung Fu film or random sexploitation flick directed by an Italian named Steven, we'll probably stick to our guns and opt for quality... the 'rep' is important, the rating too (we're on IMDb after all) and our time is too precious to care for celluloid trash no matter the nostalgic value... yet this trash was precious to QT, and because of that personal value and the way it made possible masterpieces like 'Pulp Fiction', 'Kill Bill' (I wasn't a fan of 'Basterds' and 'Django'), we connect them to a greatness they didn't have.The result is simple: any B-movie made by QT is regarded as a sort of 'Ed Wood'-like masterpiece, it's like the tools became the art, once he defined his skills and style -which were truly revolutionary- and became successful, the less he felt the need to revisit his art.
At the end, we don't love his films as much as the way they speak about what HE loves, the story doesn't matter when style is doing the storytelling.And 'Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood' is pure 1969 style, a pivotal year for 'New Hollywood' fans and those who're familiar with either the book or documentary 'Easy Riders and Raging Bulls'. It's also another occasion for QT to remind us of the movies, the TV programs, the era he grew up with and even a non-expert fan will appreciate the love-letter. But that's the catch for me, the film was enjoyable to the extent that it kept making connections with its era.Rick Dalton, played by Leo Di Caprio was consistently inserted in fictional or existing shows where he played the heavy-who-always-loses, his struggles to give a fine start to his career was in line with the evolution of Hollywood and made for a great character's arc. Cliff Booth, the stunt double, played by Brad Pitt is like a macho version of his Chanel counterpart but I couldn't resist his confrontation with Bruce Lee, played by a scene-stealing Mike Moh.As Sharon Tate, Margot Robbie has a touching moment where she smiles at the screen-performance of her real-life counterpart and she inspires a terrific cameo with Steve Mc Queen (Damian Lewis).Those scenes are great because they do put us in the mood of then-Hollywood, but whenever we're stuck with fictional characters, the charm is lost, temporarily.That's the problem when the story matters less than the cover, especially when the cover is Hollywood's history and the way Charles Manson put an end to its all-rainbow-and-flowers state of grace. But that's what makes the experience very particular. The horrific details of Tate's savage murder are still haunting me, I remember the aftermath interview of Polanski and how he insisted on Sharon never doing drugs or alcohol... so I was wondering how a film that involves the massacre of an innocent pregnant woman be tagged a comedy...I watched it with the same dread as 'In Cold Blood' and the generally lighthearted mood and the overplayed sweetness of Tate felt unsettling if not obscene.But that's underestimating Tarantino who understood perfectly that he couldn't capitalize on such an event, and that it needed a revisionist take. It's the smart move for three reasons:First, we hate the Manson killers so much that the violence that explode at the end had the good old Tarantinesque cathartic feel, and boy, did the climax feel good!Secondly, it confronts the two 'heroes' to reality again and that's where they're at their best.Finally, it ties the plot together and gives its full meaning to the Pacino character who insisted that in Hollywood, the hero always wins. which is precisely why the film ends that way. The irony of Hollywood being that if life happened like in Hollywood movie, Tate would still be alive. 'Once Upon a Time'... like in a Hollywood fairy tale. Style does the storytelling and QT isn't just one hell of a writer/director, even his directing tells stories.And I thought Al didn't have an important role, he basically makes the film's statement. Leo and Brad have enough scenes to even garner a few nominations... and all Robbie did was irradiating her sweetness, making Tate a sort of overarching angel on that telegenic mess (a tactful touch).I only regret a few moments that seem to beg for a Sound Editing Oscar nomination, fillers made of driving, smoking, feeding etc. Giving more value than needed to insignificant or inconsequent material wouldn't make 'us' fans of QT but fetishists. Maybe a response to his own fetishism for old movies? Still, and this comes from someone who shares 'that' fetishism, QT should lay off the foot thing, it's turning to an obsession.Or maybe our love for QT is a metaphor for his own foot fetishism, this is a guy who enjoy campy 'stinkers', but if he ever made some, would we tell?In fact, does it ever stink with QT?",9,14,23,24 August 2019
Gone Girl," When the 'weaker' sex is strong enough to play the 'weak' card... and win the game...
","Voice-over narration that sounds like post-coital whispers, opening credits the size of an ophthalmology screen, non-linear fuzzy editing 'Gone Girl' isn't just a slow starter, it has an irritating tendency to give you the wrong idea. I can say in all frankness that after twenty minutes, I was contemplating the idea of getting to bed and finishing the film at the morning and the 'performance' of Ben Affleck didn't help. But the story grabbed me enough so I could make it as far as the middle section, and then, all the negative vibes were gone.And not only did I love the film but retrospectively, what I saw as flaws actually made sense and even enhanced the appreciation, and that includes Ben Affleck's performance. We already suspected something was going wrong, quoting Lisa Simpson paraphrasing Churchill, what we had was 'a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma', if you consider as the 'riddle' the little game played by Amy, Rosamund Pike in a gusto performance, consisting on leaving many clues to the Police, and a few incriminating ones in the process to accuse her husband Nick, the mystery about her absence and the enigmatic personality of both Amy and Nick, a couple that had everything to be happy, except the propensity for it. Near the end, Nick's lawyer, played by a scene-stealing Tyler Perry, tells his client that they're the most twisted couple he ever met, that's an understatement.But this feeling is also the emotional reward after a build-up that needed to be long, to let the viewers make up their own mind, to be suspicious toward Nick who doesn't seem that upset when she shares his feelings with his twin sister Margo (Carrie Coon), to feel that he's hiding something until you understand why his acting was so subdued. This is a man who obviously doesn't play in the league than his wife, she's an intellectual New-Yorker, an uppity Annie-Hall-like broad without the sweetness, he's your average handsome Joe who wanted to get a girl better than him, that he succeeded was a splendid achievement, but what she saw as a beginning, he saw an ending. She followed him to Missouri and realized that marriage was asking too much in terms of sacrifice and compromises to even indulge to it.But instead of filing a divorce and getting the hell out, what she did was far worse, but in terms of creative storytelling, far more intelligent. Indeed, there have been stories of vanishing persons in the past but not as twisted and smartly pervert as David Fincher's 'Gone Girl'. It is twisted almost in the literal sense of the word as there's no plot event to be taken for granted, just when you think this is taking some specific direction, the writers find the right way to derail the plot and increasing your interest. And it is smartly pervert because it highlights some deep and usually repressed aspects of human psyche, to start with the most 'evident' one, giving the film's theme: 'haven't we all dreamed to vanish, at least once?'. I dare any married people to say they never did.People get many notions of suicides mixed up because there's no specific word for that, but there should, speaking for my own personal experience (and yes, I was particularly responsive to the film) and from what many friends shared with them, we, humans, do sometimes wish to simply vanish from existence, become someone else and never coming back. It's a way to escape from the burden of the past, the responsibilities, without any harmful self-infliction, a sort of victim-less suicide. 'Gone Girl' would have been clever enough to tackle that subject but it goes beyond, this is no victim-less suicide, but a victim-less murder, a woman simulating her disappearance to accuse her husband and earn him a sentence (since this is happening in Missouri). Now, can it get more twisted? Apparently yes, and I like that, I like that a film is hardcore enough to feature one of the most Machiavellian villains of recent history, in the Amazingly manipulative Amy, but the plot doesn't stop at that. Over the course of her diabolical project, she meets a few obstacles but she always have a trick under her sexy sleeve. And Nick is smartly played by Ben Affleck as the not-so-smart cool easy going guy, who married the wrong girl. It's all about a 'He' and a 'She' with a 'She' too sophisticated, too New York for his Midwestern taste, but he wanted his trophy wife and he had to pay for his treacherous seduction. The thing is that this 'He' and 'She' don't quite match the general perception of the public and that's how a genius she is. She's strong enough to play the weak card.She knows it's not just about leaving, it's about leaving marks that clearly accuses the husband, traces of blood, hints of pregnancy, a diary, everything is so neatly elaborate that you wish people could be as organized for benevolent reasons. I don't know if it's a personal fetish from Fincher but his movies have the tendency to feature the most beeped up masterminds, from John Doe to Tyler Durden and even counting 'The Game' corporation, the plans are so far-fetched and yet never ruin their effectiveness whatever the effect. But that Amy one is really one of a kind, she looks a darling for feminists, then she's the total antithesis, by using her intelligence and boobs as weapons.More than ever, our society lies on such polarized perceptions that you can't go beyond what the world wants to see. The woman gets away with everything, which is maybe the way to compensate the blow on feminism it makes, within its own wicked intelligence, it plays fair with the denounced archetypes and I would say about 'Gone Girl' what I said about 'Indecent Proposal', it's pure subversive brilliance.",9,0,1,18 May 2017
Django Unchained," Spaghetti is a dish best served cold ...
","It's official; 'Inglourious Basterds' and 'Django Unchained' are only the first opus of a trilogy, to be concluded by a spin-off of the first film, titled 'Killer Crow'. I don't know how reliable this piece of information is, but if Tarantino changes his mind, here are other propositions:  A young Gallic warrior witnesses the massacre of his tribe by the Romans, he becomes a gladiator then frees himself and finds the fat, decadent and truculent Roman senator (Oscar-nominated performance for John Goodman) who married the woman of his life and only survivor of the massacre, the film would be a clear homage to 50's/60's swords-and-sandals epics. Or a young Alien attacks Earth with a small group of space-smugglers, to avenge his planet blew up by a nuclear bomb while he was hunting for space-mushrooms in an asteroid, the film, would be a clear homage to 50's Sci-Fi B-movies... Or a young anthropologist (or make it a girl) goes back to the Amazonian forest in order to find and massacre the ferocious tribe of cannibals that ate her family, the film would be a clear homage to 50's Adventure B-movies and 70's/80's cannibal films.Or maybe, it would have been better to consider 'Django Unchained' as the last opus of a 'revenge' trilogy initiated by 'Kill Bill', and after that 'glorious' conclusion, Quentin Tarantino could finally abandon his retro-business film-making, recycling the same old plot lines. I know 'Django Unchained' is supposed to be a Western Spaghetti, but in all due respect, it's only a different dish cooked with the same ingredients :  Totally unredeemable villains, after Nazis and slavers, maybe one day we'll have Islamic mass terrorists, so no one would care if their heads are reduced to pulp, especially by a bad-ass hero: Jamie Foxx as a black Clint Eastwood without the charisma. A scene-stealing smooth-talking villain: 'Leo was a bingo!' and I wish he got the Oscar nod instead of Waltz who didn't bring much newness to the screen. I concede though that the casting of Samuel L. Jackson as an antagonist black character was disturbing, effective and the film's masterstroke. A bloody climax, the film features the biggest blood squibs you'll ever see, it gets a bit redundant and tends to undermine the seriousness of the subject Tarantino tries to sell. But it's even more unfortunate that the trigger was a very weak set-up, you'll judge it by yourself but Tarantino is such a great writer, he could have came up with a better idea.Speaking of the obligatory 'orgy of blood':  It made sense in 'Kill Bill' as the series was supposed to be a stylish homage to the Kung-fu movies, the over-the-top and choreographed directing elevated the film above the very standards it copied. But in 'Django' as in 'Basterds', as they say in French, Tarantino 'mixes his pencils', sometimes it's gritty and realistic in a very graphic way, and some others it's so exaggerated you can't take the seriousness of the subject, seriously. And it's even worse when you take it seriously as the 'unpleasant' aspect of violence is mostly due the way it manipulates our feelings: just because these guys are really bad guys, they deserve to die the worst way, or we're supposed to cheer at these 'geysers of blood' sights and their screams of pain. It's unpleasant because it efficiently desensitizes us from any form of guilt or sympathy.And considering all the mass-murders that occurred in America in 2012, even in the name of action and style, i'm not sure watching a guy randomly massacring people is what American young audience needs to see. Sorry, but Tarantino makes it 'look cool', using all the super-villains archetypes as an excuse to justify it, just because it's Nazis, we can scalp them, just because they're slavers, they deserve to be shot in the bloodiest way. And as usual, we're the one who 'don't get it', because violence is 'everywhere  yadda-yadda.Or maybe this was all part of the same old scheme intended to leverage the film's publicity on the typical controversy about violence? This is getting old seriously My problem with Tarantino, isn't that he should stop imitating other directors, he should stop imitating himself, it's like he knows people would love the movie first and go watch it after. Then why bother with a new idea, any Tarantino film is a good film. And the whole controversy on violence, Weinstein's lobbying, and a massive Oscar-campaign * will complete the publicity, if publicity was ever needed. I'm sure many fans would have found it average if the exact same film was directed by another name. But when it's Tarantino, woo-hoo, they all try to find reasons to love it, moved by a Pavlovian reaction.(*all the tricks that prevented Spike Lee's masterpieces such as 'Do the Right Thing', 'Malcolm X' or '25th Hour' to get the acclaim they deserved, I don't expect everyone to be a fan of Lee, but ask yourself who is the most controversial or rebel director, who's the most politically incorrect? Tarantino avoids all the racist allegations while Lee is tagged of racist and anti-Semitic very easily) Now, why shouldn't we accept that even Tarantino can lose his touch, after all, even Martin Scorsese, now that he's trying to imitate Spielberg, has lost it since 'Casino'. I used to love Tarantino, it was a time where he influenced cinema, now, it's cinema influencing him. And talk about character's under-development, Django? Kerry Washington's character? More fascinating and absorbing than Mr. Blonde? Mr. Orange? Jules Winfield? Jackie Brown or Bill? I doubt so...One positive mention though, because as much as I criticize 'Django', I quite enjoyed it as a 'benign entertainment': the Ku-Klux-Klan was probably one of the funniest scenes I've ever had to watch in a long time",7,1,4,21 February 2013
Get Out," An instant classic that won't 'get out' of your head easily!
","What a fresh wind of creativity exuding from that 'little' movie. And by little, there's no disrespect meant of course, just highlighting the not-so-trivial fact that this is a directorial debut from Jordan Peele with an actor who was relatively unknown Mr. Daniel Keluuya, and yet what we've got here is a game-changer, one of these 'little' movies popping out of nowhere but leaving in your mind the constant impression that they will be standing in cinematic memories for a long, long time. That's how 'good' 'Get Out' is.And I won't insist enough on its originality, if we were in 2007, I would have gone straight to the point but we're in 2017, a year where creativity seems to have been declining for good: Disney recycles the classics with the cheap excuse of money-grabbing live-action milking on previously built successes and big directors take the easy way of remaking, rebooting, and chaining up sequels, with no super vision and a lot of supervision. A time where the 'Star Wars' series became a soap space opera and for all the noises these movies make, all is desperately quiet on the cinematic Western front.Now, Jordan Peele's film is made of 'old stuff' but only in the way it totally deconstructs all the usual infuriating tropes of the horror genre and features, for once, a protagonist who's smart enough to figure out when things go suspicious and a 'sidekick' who incarnates our own point of view and never goes for the face-palm inducting choice. If LilRel Howery manages to slip through the image of the helpful comic relief, Keluuya is simply just too good for words, and his performance covers such a wide range of emotions that I doubt the Academy will overlook him. Now it's been three paragraphs and I can't get to the story yet, don't take it as pompousness, this is the very indicator of my enthusiasm, I don't need to tell the story because it's so good I would rather invite anyone to go see what's so good in it. Let's just say that it opens like 'Guess Who's Coming to Dinner' where Chris Washington is getting ready for meeting the rich family of his white girlfriend Rose (Alison Williams) in a secluded house, the Armitages who can't stop delivering glorifying compliments on Obama or Jesse Owens yet hire black housekeepers who look so 'Uncle Tom' it's painful to watch.But the parts meant to raise our suspicion (I won't get too wordy on them) shine because of their roles within the plot and the various reactions of Keluuya. At first, he's not really in his element and tries to fit in, but his performance is so nuanced and subtle that sometimes you can feel the crispation in his smile, the unease in his eyes, and the way he always reaches for an eye contact with Allison, with the fragility of a child begging for a parent's reassuring sign. Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener plays the Armitage parents and they're good at feigning emotions so that our suspicion is never pushed to that level where we expect the worst, Peele engages us in a harrowing journey where each step seems to take us downer toward a descent into hell but no matter what, we're never one step ahead of Chris. The plot thickens with the first display of racism from the son, played by Caleb Landry Jones, and a mysterious group of white hosts coming for a garden party and where each one indulges to one of these patronizingly racist commentsturning slowly the film to an experience à la 'Rosemary's Baby' where you can tell there's some conspiracy going on but people are so occasionally friendly, we're tempted, like Chris, to keep on a cool facade and give the benefit of the doubt. Of course, once Chris gets why he'd better get out, there's no way to get out and the film turns into one of the best horror movie experiences of recent years. I would go as far as saying that the film is an instant classic.The action and the thrills escalate, driven by the usual horror elements, the deserted houses, the jump scares, a séance of hypnosis that alone should guarantee an Oscar nomination for Keluuya, but the film never recycles plot devices, it reinvents their use in a way that respects our intelligence. Indeed, 'Get Out' is meant for viewers who've seen enough horror movies not to be tricked yet to better trick us. The film has an edge, a level of intelligence that is so bold and daring it can almost flirt with reverse parody, and maybe for that level of self-awareness, it has been nominated in the 'Comedy' category for the Golden Globes'. Still, there's nothing comedic in the performances... although there are moments in the film that make you smile a lot... often, in a disturbing way.So yes, this is a 'little' movie that stands above all today's creations in a way I didn't think was possible. Let me explain this: I've often said that today, you could only make big budget blockbuster movies if you had a name OR an independent movie that tries to be socially relevant, you know, that deals with racism, politics, environment, men and women, homosexuality etc. It would be a lie to say that 'Get Out' isn't relevant, it's perhaps one of the most intelligent recent movies to deal with racism especially in the way it highlights the mix of fascination and revulsion where the worst forms of racism are rooted... if it wasn't for that fascination, the plot wouldn't exist. So, yes, 'Get Out' is disturbing and subversively brilliant, but the social commentary is only one of the facets of its greatness, the film also works on the thrills' department and the way the action unfolds from one reveal to another until the climactic and satisfying conclusion... and that's only after a first viewing, I just realized that I failed to notice many hints and plot points and I guess it'll take me more viewings to get each time more of 'Get out''s brilliance.",10,16,32,24 December 2017
Aladdin," The Fresh Prince of Aba Boua...
","Maybe the story of Aladdin and the Magic Lamp occupies such a warm spot in my heart than any version is likely to hit a sensitive chord at some place or another.I grew up with the rather unknown French animated film of 1969, a stable in my connection with the story that made me enjoy the 1992 Disney version even more, and I guess that's the way it works and maybe the reason why this 'remaking' trend is a sure bet for Disney studios: they work on a Madeleine Proust level. I was with my daughter and I saw many parents in the theater who were my age and were obviously the same age than their children when they saw 'Aladdin', so for them, as well as for myself, it's a sort of renaissance (a word that used to mean something else) and for kids, it's a fun movie they'll enjoy regardless of their knowledge of the original. Yeah, we can call it a win-win effect.Guy Ritchie shows enough respect to the original film as if the consensus existed that nothing will replace Robin Williams' performance but it treats the material with enough special effects and costumes (obviously an Oscar contender in that category) to make for spectacular entertainment, though the singing moments proved that there's a limit to the level of extravaganza you can reach... not with special effects but with live-action looking CGI images. No matter how cute Abu is, you can't make an animal look as expressive as its cartoon version, the example of Iago is even more baffling, this parrot isn't Iago and is an insult to Iago. So that's the real problem with these remakes, the mix of computer-aided animation and live-action can create spectacular results but sometimes, it feels limited.The 'Prince Ali' and 'A Friend Like Me'... in fact, even the 'Whole New World' singing sequences, anticipated from the minute the Genie popped up, weren't disappointing but fell flat because they could never go as over-the-top as the laws of hand-drawn animation permitted... because you just can't handle real-life characters like animated props. Mena Massoud, the actor who plays Aladdin is terrific as far his looks and his smile go (and his acting is decent) but once he starts to act like an animated character, the sight is just puzzling to say the least. This is why I actually preferred Marwan Kenzari as Jafar because he maintained a sense of self-respect even within his aura of vileness, which made him credible and oddly sexy. Even the sultan was good and wasn't treated like the buffoon of the 1992 film.But I guess it all comes down to one performance: Will Smith, you couldn't replace Robin Williams but Smith proves that he's an actor Hollywood should rely on when they need a funny street-smart acolyte with a soul, that's important. There were times where he even managed to be more compelling than the original because his zaniness wasn't overplayed and because he had the features of a human being. Will Smith made the live-action more effective than the original at some parts, too few unfortunately because (and that's something I could see coming), the remake had to give a more substantial role to Jasmin, who was a strong-willed character to begin with. Indeed, the twists on the Genie were so well-thought and effective that we didn't need to have a rewriting on Jasmin.The 'revisions' on Jasmin didn't affect her character anyway and Naomi Scott did justice to the first animated character I had a crush on, but it was like her pose was constantly defined under the tagline 'I'm an independent girl and no one can't fool me' making her servant Dalia (Nasim Pedrad) more attractive through her imperfections. So I wish the film wouldn't get so overboard with Jasmin, there's a moment where she's literally pulling a 'Let it Go' and it's like the writing was so sensitive about not offending the status of Jasmin as a strong princess, especially in the one story where the princess' status is a plot point rather than a set-up, that any conspiracy theorist would believe that the sole purpose of these remakes is to serve some feminist agenda.But you know what, I don't care if it's true or not, I won't pollute the review with such thoughts, I just watched yesterday a documentary about the hellish life in ISIS-occupied territories so it would be indecent to comment on the way 'women's right of speech' can be promoted in movies, no matter how unsubtly. Maybe there's 'good propaganda' after all. And I'd rather have Arabs or Muslims be associated to the colorful though stereotypical images conveyed by these '1001 Nights' fantasy movies than any Middle-East black-clad reality, maybe there's also 'good stereotyping' after all. And it's worth mentioning that Disney did the right choices by casting ethnic actors for the part, even though they were not names, Will Smith is big enough a name to carry the film, he's the Genie of the casting after all.'Aladdin' surprised me in the way it didn't make me complain about political correctness and could make an entertainment spectacle out of a captivating story, one that delivers a powerful message to children and adults, more sophisticated than the usual 'be yourself', it's 'whatever you get by not being yourself, you'll lose inevitably'... with an underlying truth about the vain obsession of not being true to ourselves.
I called Ritchie a sell-out because, unlike Tarantino, he's not exactly making the kind of movies he was known for, but these considerations don't really matter as, the film didn't try to be something other than 'another of these lousy remakes', but within that limited range of creativity, it succeeded admirably and it was fun to watch, it hit a nostalgic chord and it had the right cast.At least, these three wishes were fulfilled.",8,1,4,30 May 2019
The Theory of Everything," Oscar-baity film-making at its finest!
","'The Theory of Everything' has everything to please the Academy, and not just in theory. Indeed, if someone tells me that James Marsh directed this movie without dreaming of the Oscars, I'll pull a Michael Corleone and say: 'now who's being naÃ¯ve?'This film is a school-case; it features all the boxes to tick for the Oscars: a contemporary biopic? Check. British celebrity? Double check. A world-wide known character? Check. Intelligent? Check. Disabled? Triple-check. A dysfunctional family drama spanning three decades? A climactic discovery? An inspirational speech? The story of Stephen Hawking was begging for a movie adaptation because this is the kind of performances that will never go unnoticed, and I bet Eddie Redmayne could already choose the spot in his cupboard for the Oscar the day he signed the script.And like Sean Penn who took away Mickey Rourke's only possible shot at the Oscars, Eddie Redmayne took it from Michael Keaton. Remember when 'Birdman' came out, it was all about Keaton until 'The Theory of Everything' raised its little head and every Academy pundit knew it was over for Batman, 'Robin' would steal his thunder. Serves him for not playing a tragic inspirational real-life figure, that's the lesson we learned from Rourke's loss. Just look at all the winners in the past 10 years: Winston Churchill, Hugh Glass, Abraham Lincoln, George VI, Amin Dada, Truman Capote, fictional characters never really pay off.And you can't even blame the Academy, Eddie Redmayne is actually the best thing about the film, his performance really makes you believe this is Stephen Hawking resurrecting as a young freshman and then slowly descending into the condition that made him such a pop culture icon celebrated in 'The Simpsons' and 'The Big Bang Theory'. And the film showed a fascinating aspect about Stephen: for someone who didn't believe in God, he exemplified the idea that God gives when he takes away and Lou Gehrig's disease was so great a handicap He could only compensate it by making Hawking the greatest mind of the twentieth century, second to Einstein.But I digress because the film, while celebrating Hawking' achievement, also focuses on his family life with Jane. Felicity Jones is good as the all-loving but then long-suffering wife, highlighting a sort of bipolar temptation from the film. It tries to be two things at the same time: 'A Beautiful Mind' and 'My Left Foot', it's far better than the former which relied on misleading thrills to make Nash' life more interesting, but maybe I wished it dared a little more and could plunge us in the mind of the genius, or focus on the internal battle between his inner self (he wasn't an isolated nerd but a lazy, easygoing fellow), his struggle to understand the universe and make himself understood.That mental exploration was the kind of stunts I expect from movies about intelligent or visionary people, to make you feel more intelligent, but the treatment is rather superficial because the story is busy swinging back and forth between drama and science, to insist on the woman behind the great man. So it all comes to a simple question: are we interested? If so, to what extent? It's always nice to have the external insight but this is why I was so critical at the film's conventional aspect (it's an Oscar baity film if I ever saw one), it should have kept Jones as a supporting character and be more focused on Hawking's world, Jones was a comforting and important presence but she wasn't pivotal in his achievements.So just when we have a glimpse on his genius and the film seems to take off to some realms of intellectual celebrations, we have the domestic life back again, problem with the kids, with the family, the gossips, the gas bills... this is a man who's contemplating the universe, the big bang, time and we have to endure the peripheral aspects, it's like someone pointing out to the moon and we have to endure the finger. I didn't hate that approach, overall, the treatment was well done but it fell flat. If Marsh anted to highlight that aspect, maybe he needed an extra hour because I didn't care much for Felicity Jones.Or maybe I should retract that bit, the first parts did annoy me in the sense that the love story looked like a retread of 'A Beautiful Mind', it became interesting when he lot the ability to speak and the marriage went downhill. However; we never feel the real transition between happy and sad Jane. So to end on a comparison, the film manages to be a sort 2010s 'Pride of the Yankees': the man's popular then there's the illness, relatives coping with them and the final speech, of course, this time, he survives but the couple falls apart. It's all done well when it comes to biopic about such tormented characters, you expect more.It's like Redmayne was trapped in that wheelchair and could only stick to Hawking's mimics in order to guarantee his Oscar, it was his zone of comfort, Jones was the actress who went beyond the limit of a two-dimensional role and gave it a poignant aura and the film could take its way to the Oscars, it played it safe and succeeded admirably by grabbing the Best Actor Oscar.
At least, 'Birdman' tried something new and got the Best Picture. But the film seems to equate the award with a series of parameters cohabiting with harmony, I guess I can say it's a great Oscar-bait movie, it's a very limited way to look at it, but still better than being a bad Oscar one. And I just realized James Marsh had won the Oscar with 'Man On Wire', so he's capable of making inspirational movies with a uniqueness of their own.",7,0,0,7 March 2019
Frozen," The Disney film that knew how to be 'important'...
","My girl was born the same year than 'Frozen', I don't think she'll ever recall her first experience with the film and that she used to dance and turn while singing 'let it go!' over and over, but I suspect she'll still have enough toys or perfumes or plastic glasses reminding her, and indirectly her daddy, of the Frozen-mania that defined her childhood. So, it's not the movie lover or the Disney fan but the father of a little girl who'll review the film.Now, a simple question, did I enjoy it? I did, not as I enjoyed recent Disney films like 'Tangled' to name this one, but I'm in no position to judge my personal enjoyment because in the end, millions of children (I suspect a vast majority of girls) went to see the film, it ended up being the highest grossing Disney movie ever, crossing the billion mark, and there are probably millions of two-year old Anna and Elsa who owe their name to 'Frozen'. So we're not reviewing a film, but a phenomenon.Indeed, just when we thought our eyes saw everything and that we had enough fairy tales stories for three generations, 'Frozen' transcended its appellation as Disney animation, even inspiring a new term 'New Renaissance', like a rebirth of Disney magic that the success of 'Inside Out' confirmed. And it's such a smash hit that I wish I could be as enthusiastic as a witness of history in motion, but I can't because I didn't enjoy the film that much, but I understand why I didn't enjoy it and I understand it doesn't really matter. When a film is so successfully commercial, no constructive review can deny this one merit.That'll sound like an odd name-dropping in a Disney review but I saw an interview of French director Jean-Pierre Melville and he said that an artist must face the fact that his work of art is a product, and as a product, it's got to be successful. Not that an artist should compromise himself but the creation has to provide something tangible to the viewer, a sensation, a feeling, an effect, otherwise, it's a pointless effort. Watching 'Frozen', I couldn't help but think what a smartly marketed film it was. It feels like your ordinary fairy tale; you get the castle, the princess, the Charming Prince, the kiss of true love, the funny sidekicks, but that's just the packaging, you ain't seen nothing till you really see it.We don't have one princess but two, two sisters, siblings' relationships have always been tense in Disney's films but in 'Frozen', it's the soul of the story, Elsa is a princess gifted with the power of turning things into ice and snow with her fingers, but after an accident that almost caused her sister's death, she's locked away till her coronation on her 18th birthday. Anna is the free-spirited jovial little sister who has a love-at-first-sight moment with prince Hans. There is a lot of exposition before the story takes off, but we get very soon that we're not heading toward the conventional Disney story: there's something too 'convenient' about the Prince and as if Elsa felt it, she refuses to give her blessing for her sister's marriage claiming that she can't just marry someone she just met, thus throwing away decades of Disney teachings! But this is nothing compared to the revolution to come, there have been female protagonists 'leaving' their place: Ariel, Jasmine, Rapuntzel but when Anna leaves the castle, the town, her responsibilities, her musical number 'Let it Go' strikes as a hymn to individuality and total purposeless freedom, some even saw there a subtle metaphor of coming-out. The writer and co-director Jennifer Lee said the film belongs to the public and any interpretation is welcome you bet, I want to say. This is the kind of ambiguity that can only hit the jackpot, the song is gutsy enough to be ambiguous, but the tone is still family friendly, it's a win-win. And it's so catchy that you just can't get it off your head. The film then ventures into very familiar territories, Anna looks for her sister, meets ice salesman Kristoff and his funny sidekick Sven and then, the quartet is completed with the adorable Olaf and I can't just resist him, if only because my daughter loves to hug Olaf-shaped pillows from furniture stores.'Frozen' feels a little shaky though in the writing; Elsa is the heroine but she's the closest to an antagonist, so the only antagonist possible was Hans, and it was awkward to see him turning into such a hateful bastard while he looked sincere in his introductory scene. Still, he wasn't a villain to measure up with the film's ambitions, but was Kristoff any more important in the 'hero' role? It's funny that such a movie so conscious of its 'significance', had needless characters story-wise (don't even get me started on the trolls) but you better believe the makers knew what they were doing, and I got it with the kiss of the true sisterly love that provided the happy end: 'Frozen' was all about Elsa and Anna, two sisters maybe that was the closest to lovers a Disney film could get, it's just as if the script was written by Lisa Simpson (remember, Equalia?), Elsa and Anna instantly made Belle and Ariel look like Snow-White and Cinderella.Feminism, girl-power is the new message of animation and as a man, I'm getting a little tired of it. 'Frozen' was so wrapped up in its message it affected the story, but I guess when you have a vision for a film and stick to it, it always pays off. I'm pretty sure that in 10-15 years, young women will be reminiscing about Anna and Elsa as the film will represent a pivotal part of their life and as a girl's daddy, I can't ignore it. 'Frozen' simply knew how to be important.",7,2,6,21 August 2016
The Lives of Others," No freedom from the other side of the Wall, not even people's walls
","'Beat your wife regularly, even if you don't know why, she will.' I doubt the Arabs really invented that saying but it seems like every totalitarian system was based on the idea that no one can make you feel guilty without your consent. Stasi didn't spy on potentially guilty people, but people were guilty already of that suspicion. Stasi: a simple whisper of that name was enough to send shivers down the spine of millions of citizens of the German Democratic Republic. It is not even far from reality to say that the population was divided in two: those who were spied and those who spied, some could slip through the net but for how long? The Stasi used spying and intimidating methods that had nothing to envy from the way Gestapo could treat the German population, and the opening of 'The Lives of Others' sets the tone.Wiesler, a Stasi agent, is giving a course. He explains to his students the virtues of keeping a prisoner awaken for forty hours, the so-called arrogance he displays will inevitably be broken. With a no-nonsense didactic tone, he reveals all these little tricks that allow the police to spot the guilt, an innocent person will shout in rage, a guilty one will weep and beg for mercy, a truth will be formulated in different ways but a lie is always made of the same lines. It is tragic that such methods existed, and even more that they sometimes worked. With cold detachment but impressive competence, Wiesler says more about the Stasi than a one-hour documentary, and from the start, the young director Donnersmarck shows a remarkable attention to small details. Notice the scene when a student questions the humanity of the methods, everyone can see Wiesler putting a cross under his name but it's not in the mark, but in the discreet and smooth way he does it and then immediately answers the question. Notice also the prisoners asked to keep his palms on the chair so that the sweat on the cushion can be used for bloodhounds, this element never serves the film but it conveys one crucial element: the Stasi has an eye for detail, and so should we, if we want to appreciate or understand what happens.This attention to detail says even more: anyone could be submitted to surveillance on the basis of suspicion, something that doesn't feel 'right'. When Wiesler is invited to see a play from writer Dreirman (Frederick Koch), all it takes is a simple look at that handsome long-haired man with an opened shirt, and a lovely woman, actress Christa-Maria (Martyna Gedeck), to suggest an investigation. Dreyman did nothing wrong but he's too well-established to be totally clean and something about his friends doesn't feel Kosher, so the Minister (Thomas Thieme) approves, moved by selfish reasons. His last feat was to forbid acclaimed author Gershka to work, when Dreirman defends his friend, the Minister denies such things happen and invites Dreyman to moderate his words.Yet Gershka is the specter of what awaits Dreyman: losing your job, your contacts and the freedom to leave the country, not that everyone wanted to leave Germany, and the height of irony is that many artists were socialists (and would never be as creative as under the totalitarian regime). The veiled threats of the Minister, the situation of Gershka and the relative comfort bourgeois Dreirman lives in, are so many parameters to take into consideration, it's all about choices that jeopardize your life, it's a choice he has to make, and in the movie, choices are often driven by fear. It is very interesting that the biggest 'thrills' of the film come from situations where we fear for the protagonists, so we have a taste of what life under this regime was.But what makes the story so unique is that we have two persons who couldn't have been more opposite. Dreyman represents life, conflicts, torments, problems with his work, friends, life, courage or lack of, while Wiesler is a professional agent: he's alone, all dressed in gray, has sex with prostitutes, it is like his existence has been totally dedicated to his job, but by following the daily life of Dreyman, a strange juxtaposition of feelings occurs, he starts to discover a strange one some would call 'empathy'. The film then becomes a character-study about a man who supposed to study people and we witness his slow but progressive coming-to-realization on the tragedy that people live. There's a magnificent scene with a little boy that shows how Wiesler's foundations are being shaken, for the best.Now, what is exactly 'Lives of Others' about? Some would suggest that it is the intrusions into people's private lives and the lessons for today's generations, why are we so content to share our opinions and private lives on social media while they can backfire at us? And what lessons can the free world give when the threats of aggression from the exterior are always served as excuses to intrude into people's private lives? Recently, my Facebook account was blocked because I used a nickname, I'm supposed to send them an ID card to have my account back, that alone gives me an idea of how deeply attached to my privacy I am. Perhaps the worst aspect of the Stasi is that it is somewhat relevant today, in this post-9/11 world.Or maybe the film is simply about goodness and humanity? About the fact that a malevolent presence can as well become a guardian angel, because it takes to get deeper in people's lives, to feel their flaws and weaknesses to realize the extent of the harm... On many levels, the film is inspirational and no one can't resist to the ending, a magnificent visual epitaph from Ulrich Muhe who sadly passed away one year after the film, but whose performance enriched the lives of the 'others' that we -movie lovers- are.",10,1,3,26 March 2017
Good Will Hunting," A well-made rather than a well-filled head ...
","Among the cinematic characters that I immediately identified with, there is « Good Will Hunting », though I'm not fortunate enough to be gifted with the same intelligence ... BUT I know how it feels not to exploit one's own talents for his personal life and constantly try to find excuses for that.The story is probably one of the most inspiring and best written scripts from the last two decades, and to think that Matt Damon is the co-writer, with his childhood friend, Ben Affleck – they both played best buddies in the film- makes it even more realistic and inspiring. In fact, there is something that always works in the stories where the screenwriter and the lead actor are the same, take 'Citizen Kane', 'The Great Dictator', 'Rocky', 'Sling Blade' or the vast majority of Woody Allen's films, the character is written and played by the same actor, he's his own mind, and own body, there is an authentic feeling as if the man doesn't even play. The script is personal, and the film is only an excuse to transcend something personal into a biggest project that would create a wider appeal. And I would never say enough how 'Good Will Hunting' appealed to me.The story, is about a kid, a tough kid, an extremely intelligent tough kid who grew in South Boston and lived the kind of childhood that could have been laughably cliché had the movie been handled by a bad director or editor. But the revelations of his past go so smoothly that Will Hunting, despite his good intentions, appears more like an arrogant prick than a victim, and THIS is interesting. To depict him as a victim would have considerably changed the value of his gift, it would have been the solution of his problems while in fact, it works like a double-edged sword. Will has an extraordinary power of abstraction, or memorization, of understanding that he can solve the toughest Maths problems, can speak of History, Geography, Politics, Economics, Philosophy, like you'd speak about the one thing that passionate you the most, and he probably knows better than you even in that field. Basically, Will makes you feel dumb, or useless, or unable to use your own knowledge. Even the professor Gerald Lambeau, who'll try to find a future for Will, ends up like a Salieri recognizing his worthless value compared to Will, the Mozart of Mathematics.But the key of the story is to understand the reasons of Will's behavior, which obviously would lead him to a dead-end. When you think about it, his intelligence saved him from jail, which allowed him to know his girlfriend. Speaking of her, let's get back to the scene where they meet. The scene is probably one of the most memorable cinematic 'ownage' where Will avenges his best friend who was victim of a literally intellectual bullying by an arrogant Harvard prick. Will puts him in his place with the idea that it doesn't takes studies to be intelligent, it takes enough curiosity to learn more than what we're intended to and then try to put that knowledge into perspective. An excellent lesson about how to use our intelligence. But then something ambiguous happens, when Will meets his therapist, Sean Maguire, Robin Williams in a quite perfect performance. Will acts with him exactly the same way the Harvard boy did, using his knowledge to try to push him down. But instead of being upset, Sean feels the potential of Will and a nice retort for the next meeting. 'Do you think I would understand how it feels to be an orphan because I read Oliver twist?' Will knows, but his knowledge is theoretical, there's the tragic feeling of emptiness governing his life. Life is about guts, heart, emotions, and Sean, animated by a growing fatherly love, will try to open Will's heart, so he can give his life a meaning as Sean obviously found something in Will, to get out from his self-pitied widow condition, a man lost in his memories with no better future.Will Hunting is not a bad guy, as implies the title's adjective. But he fears rejection, and hangs out with the same group which work like an indirect carapace. He's certainly not incapable of being friendly, in love or having fun, but as soon as things go serious, he becomes defensive. The movie provides a fascinating character study in the real sense of the world, we are put in the shoes of a psychiatrist and try to understand Sean's motives, and why Will is such a hard nut to crack. It's an intelligent movie about intelligence, and that respects our intelligence, and more than that, the intelligence of the film is carried by an excellent script that brings so many moments of verbal delights. Will's speeches are priceless; it's like reciting a whole book, with coherence and inspiration. And the films question our visions of intelligence : for Lambeau, it's Excellence, for Maguire, it's Happiness. The inspiring message of the film, is that Will Hunting can reconcile between both. Inspiring is indeed a word that rhymes with 'Good Will Hunting'. And I think Minnie Driver deserves a mention as the one who drove the heart element of the film, as Skylar –why did they had to name her like that anyway-, who had such a genuine feeling, I thought her romance and break-up created another authentic dimension in Will's multi-layered personality.'Good Will Hunting' is an exploration into the complexities of human relationships, and on a self-reflexive approach, the conclusion of the film is like a mathematical problem finally solved, but human relationships is not an exact science you know, so maybe, I say maybe, happiness is a little more important than excellence  as the French author, Michel de Montaigne, said once : 'a well-made rather than a well-filled head.'",10,1,4,13 June 2011
Room," When making a world out of a room seems easier than making room in the world...
","Ever since I've been following the Award season, I was wondering what was exactly about this 'Jacob Tremblay' kid. I had never heard about him, but the more awards nominations he got, the more pictures of 'Room' I was discovering, the more intriguing that skinny pale-looking child with unusually long hair was, especially that movie snapshot of his stunned look crossing as you could tell he was witnessing something of hypnotic beauty.First, I thought Tremblay was portraying some kind of autistic kid, then the story of a mother and her child trapped in a room made me expect a movie about confinement, and the ability of creating a world out of a horrible situation. And the kid looked strange enough to make me believe that he was victim of a condition forcing him to be isolated. Lenny Abrahamson's 'Room' was the kind of film that is surrounded by an aura of mystery, but that alone wouldn't have been enough without the whole awards-buzz, so like many others, I saw it to see what was good about it.At first, I was disrupted by the whole voice-over narration, I wasn't really ready for some abstraction à la 'Tree of Life', and I wished the kid wouldn't be too strange, even within the story's strangeness. But doubts immediately vanished, Jack was a normal kid who loved to play, to please his mother Joy, played by Brie Larson, to be told that he's grown up, to write, to draw, except that everything he does, and been doing since he was born, took place in that small shed, whose only door to the world is a skylight. And as the story goes, we get the circumstances of their presence there, especially when there's a sort of figure named Old Nick who's the only known outsider.The film echoes many news items about women or kids who've been abducted for years and years, being raped and having children with their own captor, the kind of stories that make you wonder how can anyone survive from such conditions. It's the mark of great films not to answer questions directly but to make you answering them on your own. Jack, unlike Joy, doesn't know what he missed and the whole world, as far as he's concerned is the room and whatever is in the room is real. A mouse is real, a spoon or a kitchen sink or a wardrobe are called by 'mister' or 'mrs' but whatever appears in that box named TV is made of pictures and can't count as real. And as far as humanity goes, there's him, his mother and Old Nick, played by Sean Bridgers.Jack can't be unhappy or his unhappiness is limited to his world. However, his mother spent only 7 years of her life there; she not only knows what she's missing but she knows damn well what Jack is missing. And if Jacob Tremblay deserves the praise for his performance, there's something in Larson's acting that cuts straight to the heart. She is devastated but she must hide it,, the presence of Jack is the only thing that keeps her alive, otherwise, she would have killed herself. Jack is her skylight. But there comes a point where enough is enough, and for his own good, she can't let Jack drown in a fantasy-world that might eventually destroy him. This is a story of a mother's responsibility, and she's got to stop pretending and get her son out of there.She first thinks of faking illness so Nick can take Jack to the hospital but instead of that, Nick goes outside to buy antibiotics. She then teaches Jack how to play dead, so she can wraps him under a carpet and ask Nick to 'bury' him, this is where Jack must free himself. They say even a frail mother can increase tenfold her strength if her child is in danger, the same goes when Nick wants to check the body. Joy learned how to fake emotions, but now, she has to make it 'Oscar-worthy' so that Nick is convinced not only to take the body but not to bury him in the garden and take him on his truck. Joy keeps her head on the carpet not to let anything betray her nervousness, and the plan works. I guess there's a justice if Larson wins the Oscar if only for that scene where she gave her best acting in order to forever stop acting after that, the climax of her room years of pretension.And a lesser film would have made it the real 'climax', and make 'Room' a sort of mother-and-son version of 'Life is Beautiful' with a heart-warming slow-motion reunion at the end, people crying and some cheerful happy-ending music but 'Room' is respectful enough to our intelligence not to tell us that everything will go perfectly right after such an experience. The second act consists on Joy and Jack coping with their trauma, and building new relationship with family members who's either strangers or estranged to their world. 'Room' isn't about people stuck in a room during seven years, but stuck in the world after such experience, and this time, it's harder for Jack.Indeed, I finally saw what was beyond that picture, Jack had a stunned 'where am I?' born-baby look, with his vision blurred because of the years spent in obscurity, he was reborn, but life will go very fast for him. One day, he'll ask his grandmother (Joan Allen) to cut his hair (a vivid symbol of 'Room' days, his Samson-like 'strength' as Joy told him) and this action ironically makes him even stronger, and is a positive signal for Joy. Then they visit the room again and Jack realizes how small it was, just as when we visit a childhood place. He didn't grow much physically after the 'Room' but he could finally enjoy life now that he discovered how wonderfully big it was.",9,2,6,28 February 2016
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Too much of an 'in-betweener' to be fully enjoyed, except for the introduction of one key character...
","I called 'The Fellowship of the Ring' the first instant classic of the 21st century and one of the many accomplishments the film achieved was to be listed as the 2nd Best Fantasy Movie by the American Film Institute and to be the most recent film to make it in the AFI's Top 100 Greatest Movies of All Time. What I forgot to mention is that it wasn't the most recent to be listed in any AFI's film for this privilege goes to its successor 'The Two Towers' listed in AFI's Top 100 Movie Quotes. Do I need to mention which line made it in the Top 100?The line says a lot about the key element of 'The Two Towers', it introduced one to one of the most emblematic characters of the trilogy, the creepy yet weirdly cute in his childlike attitude: Gollum. In less than ten minutes, Gollum is as fully developed a character as all the members of the Fellowship of the Ring put together, from his voice and speech mannerisms to his elastic moves and constant crawling as if he was constantly looking for something one might have accidentally dropped, something of high value, that he'd call, with his raspy and ominous voice, 'my previous'. And if it wasn't for the introduction of Gollum, I'm afraid the second opus of the trilogy might have only been a continuation. And even being the continuation of a classic full of so many characters and based on the rich, dense and labyrinthine plot of Tolkien's book isn't enough to grab you by the eyes and hook you to the story, unless you're hardcore Tolkien's fan, and even then. A second opus isn't just the 'what-goes-next' but also the second offering of a director, and apart from the hypnotic presence of Gollum and his mysterious and fascinating split personality, I must admit that sometimes, throughout the film, I stopped paying attention to the screen. I know everything looked great, and everyone did justice to their roles. But it seemed like the novelty was gone, and the plot dragged on for too long. Ironically, the Tolkien purists complained that five chapters were abandoned and the story went too fast.I trust their perception but I think this says a lot more about the difficulty to adapt a story of such epic scale. At one point, there were new characters every ten minutes, and they all looked the same: dressed with medieval fashion, long hair, bearded, noble looking or close enough. So I tried to focus on the faces I knew, the ones I could name, and eventually, I could spell, I felt secure as long as I had Frodo in the screen, and Sam, Gollum who won me instantly, Araghorn, Legolas and Gimli (whose height relegated him to the rank of comic reliefs after the two side- kicks hobbits were gone). But by the second third of the film, even these characters couldn't carry the story. There came a moment where Frodo's wide-eyed expression started to annoy me, where I didn't much care for the talking tree subplot and when even the return of Gandalf left me perplex.'The Two Towers' confronted me to the one reality that the first installment miraculously prevented; I'm not into Fantasy movies. Not to be pedant or cynical, but I'd say the problem of Fantasy is that it has too much fantasy indeed, it is so virtually full of possibilities that even death loses its realism, anyone can kill but anyone can be saved, I knew Gandalf would survive and was I glad to see him back on the screen, but when you have a character falling to a certain death in a mountain of lava and coming back triumphant, you know the notions of odds is relative. It's like the entire storytelling is governed by the primitive pattern that good guys will win, inevitably, because they're good by essence not because of some powers or skills. Inversely, the enemy contains so many hideous creatures that you know they're like naturally inept to win, on the long term.The film was great in every technical aspect, the production design, the special effects, the battle sequences, but the offering was nothing new once you've digested the first part. The film certainly works as a link between the introduction to this magical universe and what will be the climactic confrontation of the end, but that's what it is, an in-between movie highlighted by the introduction of Gollum, which is the equivalent of Master Yoda in 'The Empires Strikes Back', but 'Two Towers' is no 'Empire' equal. 'Empire' is a classic on its own, not a continuation. Besides, the 'Star Wats' trilogy was built on a three-year span between the movies while 'The Lord of the Rings' provided each opus one year after another, the first one was the immersion, the last one was the farewell. The second was probably the one that had the least time to be appreciated. And maybe Peter Jackson knew it and you can tell some unusual hastiness in the storytelling, the one pointed out by the Tolkien fans. Maybe this is why it focuses more on the human characters and on more conventional war/history movies tropes, while the Hobbits are left in the background. Somehow, anyone would get the feeling that the third one will be better, so perhaps the merit of 'Two Towers' lies on the frail shoulders of Gollum, the first CGI character played by an actor, Andy Serkis. The combination of electronics and real acting, seven years before 'Avatar' is the one milestone, the film achieved. Not that bad, after all.",7,0,1,11 November 2016
Schindler's List," My review of 'SCHINDLER'S LIST' ...
","INTRODUCTION :Steven Spielberg always developed an interest for WW2 more than any other film-maker of his generation, mostly concerned by the Vietnam War and its cultural impact. Therefore, he revolutionized the Industry of film-making, not the mentalities. He never made thought-provoking or introspective films like 'Apocalypse Now' or 'Taxi Driver'.This attachment to the past, to childhood cemented Spielberg's indisputable talent to entertain and touch hearts, genuinely or deliberately. Spielberg had a traditional view on film-making, which consecrated him when the 80's saw the return of a more conventional style. In the early 90's, he was the most successful director capable of the best like 'Duel', 'Jaws' or 'The Color Purple', movies where, ironically, his touch was less present, as much as the worst like 'Hook' which caricatured the Spielberg traits to the extreme.When Spielberg dilutes himself behind the camera, he can be incredible, when he indulged himself to express some sentimentality; it rarely worked after the 80's. That's why my favorite of his films, 'The Color Purple' is the most misunderstood, why 'Jurassic Park' will never surpass 'Jaws' and why 'Saving Private Ryan' is weak compared to the movie I'll review now : 'Schindler's List'.SCHINDLER'S LIST :The movie opens on a religious ceremony, the colors slowly fade, like a painful flash-back into an episode forever rooted in memories. And the black-and-white cinematography suggests the haunting presence of death in the minds of people whose only 'crime' was to be Jewish and the hearts of us, viewers, whose only 'excuse' was to be born after that tragedy. And there starts a tragedy of epic proportions following different levels of grief.DENIAL OF EVILNESS : When a one-armed old man is killed like an animal because he's useless for the Third Reich, I was caught by surprise. When kids were shot, I was shocked. And I have no words to describe the whole Krakovia Ghetto massacre sequence. The duality of horror as the most atrocious form of barbarity that contaminated civilized men ; how can a man who plays Bach or Mozart, exterminate a family with the same hand? Or a beautiful gift allowing sick people 'to never hear the gunshots'.ANGRY INCOMPREHENSION : One of the most despicable movie characters ever, Amon Goeth, whose leisure consisted on killing Jews in the most gratuitous way, doesn't even deserve to be called 'villain' as his evilness transcends any cinematic perception. The shooting of the engineer Diana Reiter is the part I couldn't get out of my mind, so unexpected, random and cold-blooded, the moment defines the torture endured by people in Concentration Camps, not just physical, but psychological, as any day could be the last one of your whole life, depending on the mood of an officer, or a defect in a gun.DEATH ACCEPTANCE : The absurd level of cruelty changes the very perception of death, and provides sometimes some sort of darkly comedic reliefs moments, like when a kid points his finger on the chicken thief who's 'coincidentally' the first man shot by Amon Goeth. Ralph Fiennes as the suave beast, who exercised his right to kill or spare like a Roman Emperor, perfectly captured the essence of evilness trapped in his own torments, probably loving his power more than hating the Jews, as the exaltation of a kind of bestial superiority.DEVASTATING SADNESS : The word 'depression' would be an indecent understatement, some passages are absolutely devastating, thanks to a direction, guilty of perfection, and John Williams' sober and emotional score. I understand this must have been painful for Spielberg, a man who loves children, to shoot the part where kids hid in a toilet hole, where the little girl in red 'reappeared', not to mention the gut-wrenching climactic shower scene. My heart was hysterically screaming with these women who thought it was the end.LIGHT OF HOPE : Liam Neeson plays Oskar Schindler as a man with a way with people and women in particular. However, his depiction is undermined by something betraying the ambitious nature of a War profiteer. This characterization proved to work for characters like Rick Blaine (there's something strangely Bogart-esque in the way Neeson holds his cigarette) but the subject here is too serious for glamorization. He's a businessman who thinks of interests, and progressively, his natural charisma will become providential. It's ironic how he, the German, and his Jewish assistant, Yitzhac Stern, played by Ben Kingsley, handle as a business project what will be one of the most generous and humanistic acts ever. Who saves one life, saves the humanity  CONCLUSION :Whatever I said in this review concerning Spielberg loses its relevance when it comes to 'Schindler's list', his greatest film because it's probably the only one where you can find both the personal touch, and something that speaks for Humanity, to remember one of its most shameful pages.But the criticism starts again regarding the reception of 'Schindler's List'. The film has been described with so many superlatives that I really question the sincerity of this immediate prestige and if it's not just proportional with the gravity of the subject. Does 'Schindler's List' really deserve to be in the American Film Institute's Top 10? Is it really that iconic in American Pop Culture? I also read that 'Schindler's List' was voted the best film ever made by the German film magazine 'Cinema', and it felt like the film was automatically praised as a way to make up for the guilt of having allowed these crimes to be committed. I hope I am wrong because I truly love 'Schindler's List', but I just don't like the simplistic and systematical way the movie is praised.But I sincerely hope the inspirational message of the film would inspire others about so many overlooked atrocities, just because some countries can't generate a film-maker with the same talent and influence as Steven Spielberg.",10,9,14,23 July 2011
The Incredibles," Ordinary Heroes ... Super Family ...
","For his directorial debut in the Pixar Studios, Brad Bird had an idea of genius.Indeed, 'The Incredibles' is two things: a superhero movie genre with all the predictable archetypes and it's a commentary on the restraining uniformity of American suburban life. That 'super hero/ ordinary family' contrast is the core of the film and the inspiration for its greatest moments. This achievement is even more remarkable given how familiar we are with these archetypes, yet they work in such a symbiosis that the set-ups are always predictable but not the outcomes, and the starting gimmick reveals itself a never-ending source of fun and entertainment.The identity of superheroes and their struggle to fit in the real life is an overused theme but because we're watching a family movie, the formula is totally reversed, 'The Incredibles' is about a 'normal family' trying to keep their super-heroic background secret, the focus is on the normal identity, not the superheroes. The first scenes are misleading: Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) has an appointment yet finds the time to save a cat, stop a bank robber, and bag thief with the providential help of Elastigirl (Holly Hunter), he meets one of his friends, Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson), he prevents a man from suicide, he intercepts a French villain with the suave name of Bomb Voyage, and one of his fans, a wannabe sidekick named IncrediBoy (Jason Lee) to blew it with his intervention. What a night, but he finds the time to join the church and marry the woman of his life, Elastigirl  the tone is set, the whole super-heroic stunts were just the prelude to a beautiful family story.But these stunts weren't without consequences, two of them will be particularly dramatic. The suicidal man sues Incredible for having ruined his death rather than saved his life, starting a streak of successful lawsuits where heroes are condemned to pay indemnities for undesired interventions, hence becoming a liability to the Stage government. Finally, it's decided each of them to be relocated in a sort of witness protection-like program, with the order not to ever interfere, and live in anonymity. Superheroes all have weaknesses, Kryptonites, but no one can beat the bureaucracy. The enemy is normality. And this is a constant theme as the father Incredible, now Bob Parr, can't resuscitate the old past glory and is forced to work in a cubicle for a petty boss, Helen is a devoted housewife teaching her son not to run too fast, and fit in the crowd by not being special, not the super-heroic way. This contributes to one of the best quotes : 'everyone's special' 'which means no one is'. I love how they twist the old cliché of the little boy who can't fit, but this time in the other way.The second consequence was that the rejected sidekick will finally fill his heart with enough anger and resentment to become a supra-villain, in a mix of Lex Luthor and Spectre, in fact, many elements from 'The Incredibles' borrows from James Bond and the 60's secret service superheroes classics, and the vintage feeling is a delight for the eyes. Even the setting looks like a futuristic view of USA as it was envisioned in the 60's, on this level, Brad Bird and team did a terrific job. Sensual secretaries, tropical landscape, launched missiles, a scene-stealing little designer, voiced by Brad Bird, and who plays the Q role, the super-heroic element is responsible for the greatest thrills while the family is the heart. This combination is the secret of 'The Incredibles'. We know the little boy Dash, will have to run faster than ever for an extreme great chase, we know Violet, the shy teenager will sure be capable to use her power to create magnetic field and impregnable bubbles, but how refreshing to share their first frustration. The kid can't run, and she's so shy she makes herself invisible.It's great to see Mr Incredible reluctant to use his force although sometime he can help it, while he breaks the car window by closing the door too strongly or lifting it out of anger, or doing something we're all dreamed of like squashing the boss in the walls, he has to wait before fully using his powers. And Helen is reluctant to wear her new outfit and when she does, she can't help but notices her curves in the mirror. The script characterization keeps us with the sensation that we're watching real people, and the super powers become almost accessory, they do contribute to a variety of actions but it's all Bob, Helen, Dash, Violet  and yes, the baby Jack-Jack whose powers are unknown yet, but we can figure that they're letting it for the last act. It's a Family film in the real meaning of the word, it's for the family and about a family.Most of the plot relies on very common clichés, but the film is much aware for them, and never hesitates to show it, denouncing the infamous monologue cliché or the way capes can become a lethal target, not to mention Samuel L. Jackson's performance, so authentic, calling it self-parody would be insult.",9,3,4,30 April 2015
The Elephant Man," The 3 'S' that damaged the story: Sentimentalism, Symbolism and Simplification ...
","The shadowy black and white photography communicates all the horror of John Merrick's condition and the darkness of an era where people were incapable to see inner humanity behind a hideous deformity (and it conveniently made the make-up more realistic). John Morris' score, haunting and playful, echoes the seemingly reason-to-be of John Merrick in life: suffering and entertaining. John Hurt powerfully communicates the vibrating despair of a trapped soul and if it wasn't for Robert De Niro in 'Raging Bull', he probably would have deserved the Oscar. And Anthony Hopkins is good as the well meaning, but not without flaws, doctor Treves. There is also something effective in the way Merrick's scariness is asserted, David Lynch waits until almost twenty minutes to reveal his face: we see a woman crying in the Carnival, Treves with that deadpan expression and tears coming through his eyes, the iconic mask exuding mysterious breath noises, the shadowy silhouette while he's exhibited to the Medical assembly, and the whole mystery surrounding his look pinnacles with the genuine horrified reaction of Nora, the nurse, a shrill scream, Merrick's first effect on people. At the end, he escapes from his evil master Bytes (Freddie Jones) and is chased in the train station to end up cornered in the toilets, then he finally screams: 'I'm not an animal! I'm a human being! I'm a man!' At that point, his character's arc is closed; he went from a horrifying freak to a man who is capable to protest, to proclaim his legitimate right for respect and dignity. This is the true courage of John Merrick, this climactic moment when he confronts, alone, a crowd of so-called civilized people.The entrance of 'The Elephant Man' is a masterpiece of build-up; the climactic cry is his triumph. Yet the evolution between the two moments isn't as fluid as it should be. He goes from a patient who can barely speak to one who recites the Bible quite fluently. Naturally, it would have been infuriating if the doctors never noticed his intelligence, but the moment when Carr-Gomm (John Gielgud) is disappointed by Merrick's aptitudes is immediately followed by the pivotal recitation. It's like Lynch was in an urge to show Merrick's progress. I personally wouldn't have minded if the film was half-an-hour longer for a more realistic evolution. The psalm recitation is rewarded by an immersion in society, during which Merricks prove to be an extremely lovable character, eager to please and impress. There is a childish pride in the way he exhibits the picture of his mother and Hurt is so compelling that you can even feel in his voice, the guilt of not matching his mother's looks. At that part, you can tell that Merrick is still imprisoned in his own perceptions and can't help but see himself as a freak on a reverse way since the irony of his intelligence is that it makes his condition even more intriguing. As Treves said: 'Pray to God he is an idiot' But the film unsubtly divides people into two categories: those who see the monster and those who see the angel. Regarding the villains, Lynch had the bad taste to trade realism for a sort of Dickens-like atmosphere, which didn't fit Merrick's existential dilemma. I didn't like the party scene because it was cruel but because it was over the top, with the whole kissing, dancing, and alcohol soaking. Now, wasn't the most disturbing part when the guard showed the mirror to Merrick? Hurt's scream was devastating, but it was covered by the noisy ambiance so we didn't have time to grab the true horror of the situation. That moment alone was enough to make the scene painful to watch, Merrick seeing his own face. And it would have made the 'I'm a man!' more significant because he would know he didn't look like a man. But he also spoiled the straight-forward realism of the story with exaggeratedly good characters, like Mrs Kendal (Anne Bancroft) who reads 'Romeo and Juliet' with Merrick and kisses him. Why the rush? Think about it, would she have done that to a 'normal' person? If it was a compassionate kiss, then it's still pity, if it was not, it would have looked more genuine and maybe more sincere if it happened later. If Bancroft was supposed to play a character that would spontaneously kiss a man like Merrick, then she deserved more scenes. It seems like Lynch didn't trust our patience. In a nutshell, it's 'Merrick, the Elephant Man' before, 'Merrick, the Man' after, and in-between, he swings back and forth from excessively good or excessively bad people. Maybe it's to highlight Merrick's tragic condition, to be always seen as a monster, no matter what reactions he inspires, there is always pity. Maybe that's the conflict that tortures Treves when he wonders to which extent he's different from Bytes. By the way, I'm not implying that every supporting character was one-dimensional, Wendy Hiller was terrific as Mrs Mothershead and the funny way she hit the guard on the head. And I thought the standing ovation in the theater damaged the powerful effect of the 'I'm a man!' The same defensive (but courageous) mindset should have made him say something like 'I want to enjoy the show, what have I ever done to deserve your applause, please stop it.' After all, no one deserves praise for suffering, or should be considered as a hero because of a handicap. Just give him a break, and this applies to Lynch himself, who thought he could get all mystic about Merrick, with the first vision of a woman trampled (or raped) by an elephant or the ending with all the stars and symbolism. He was so restrained in the directing that the whole surrealistic undertones were totally unnecessary.",8,3,5,15 November 2012
Dog Day Afternoon," The Most-Defining Movie of the Boiling 70's ...
","You all know the story: a simple bank robbery supposed to take twenty minutes, during a hot summer afternoon  From a simple but terrific premise, Sidney Lumet made a masterpiece out of one of the most bizarre and memorable media freaks shows, like only the 70's could have featured. With the Al Pacino and John Cazale's tandem back on the road, proving their immense versatility as you totally forget that one year before, in a no less prestigious crime film, Al knew it was John, and gave him the kiss of death in an immortal movie scene  'Dog Day Afternoon' is a thrilling, captivating, and exhilarating experience honoring the zany unpredictability of life. Just when you think you had enough of surprises, something comes to shock, amuse, or disorient you. It's like a sitcom structured by a solid narrative and driven by an amazing Oscar winning script, full of priceless one-liners. And the film inspires so many emotions you wonder if this will have a happy or a sad ending. It's both tragic and comic, sometimes heart-breaking, sometimes hilarious. Like Sonny's ridiculous over-cautiousness to find out that there's no money and worse, that police was already waiting from outside. Not to mention the way he struggled to get the rifle out of the flower-box, the third accomplice who chickened out... from the beginning, the job was so amateurish both the hostages and the audience wondered what was going on. The movie opens with the realism of 'Serpico' and a nut that'll be very hard to crack, somewhat like '12 Angry Men''s verdict, and a character so sympathetic, while realizing it will be a very long day Sympathetic but not pathetic... progressively, there's a revelation. Sonny Wortzik is more than a clumsy bank robber: the guy has nerves, a heart, he acts tough, but is put in his place when he curses. He definitely doesn't want anyone to get hurt. And the genius of the script is Sal. He literally 'salted' the film giving it that thriller flavor, with his scary look and eagerness to kill anyone. John Cazale totally embodies the idea of a man who has nothing to lose, and doesn't want to go to jail. With this ticking bomb of a character, we know it can go wrong at any time. And Sonny's job is to keep Sal calm inside, when he has other business to deal with outside.Sonny is indeed the cinematic incarnation of the man who tries to keep everything on control. His memorable interactions with Sgt. Moretti, Charles Durning in a remarkable performance, even highlight the evolution of this character who, from self-confidence and condescending tone becomes more fatherly towards Sonny, as if he was mirroring Sonny's very psychological situation, trying to keep things cool while cops were all targeting the bank and the crowd coming to watch the show. A modern circus show with Al as the biggest star, and the media as the lions coming to devour him. And what a showman that Sonny! One of the greatest performances from Al Pacino who gives to his character a moral and political dimension forever incarnated by the immortal 'Attica! Attica!'. A general and cheerful Stockholm Syndrome, he wins the people's hearts and ours with one of the most legendary rally cries evoking a lost era where people had the guts to stand for their beliefs. 'Dog Day Afternoon' is one of the most-defining films of the 70's, with a rebellious mind, and a heart too And God, the heart of the film... when you expect, you had all the surprises; the best is to come when we learn why Sonny robbed the bank with the entrance of Leon, his 'wife', portrayed in a nuanced but powerful performance by Chris Sarandon as a woman trapped in a man's body. Yep, the movie is full of strong supporting performances. Chris is so convincing we feel this tender love and complicity that could inspire Sonny the desperate idea to rob a bank to pay for his lover's sex change. A complicity translated by the legendary improvised phone-call scene, which genuinely contrasts with the noisier one with Sonny's official (and talkative) wife. These are the elements that placed Sonny Wortzik among the most fascinating characters of cinema's history and made Pacino a legend, with a character who couldn't have been more different than the icy and cold-blooded Michael Corleone. The story provides him a human touch, he's got a life, a wife, a lover, and he lives and leaves them with such intensity we lose the control of the film. We were laughing, now we feeling Sonny's pain as he's dealing with this tragicomedy, his loss of control and of the people's sympathy after his homosexuality was revealed. Al Pacino's eyes burn with an intensity crystallizing an out of control situation. It's dark, sweaty, we can hardly breathe, and the claustrophobic feeling transcends the bank, even the film. The film which concludes as it started, in an abrupt, detached and cold way. The police kills Sal and Sonny begs for life. He didn't want to betray Sal, but in a way, he was so alienated by the whole craziness of the situation, he lost the control and didn't even realize how nuts he's gone, like wondering one minute before his arrest if he'll have food in the plane, or believing he was really going to Algeria. The tragic realization that makes you wonder how this happened, and Pacino's eyes look like he's telling himself, 'how could I have ever thought I had a chance'...... sanity was back again, the show was over and the movie could conclude.",10,6,8,26 May 2011
Amadeus," In the Name of God, Mozart, and the Holy Music ...
","'Amadeus', is a powerful portrayal of jealousy's poisoning effect in the heart of the envious. F. Murray Abraham turns his performance as Salieri, the unsung hero of the classical music Golden Age into the unforgettable fictional villain who killed Mozart, after he murdered his own soul, by making God his enemy. The title holds therefore a particularly ironic meaning if you think of Salieri's relationship with God. Amadeus is not just Mozart's middle name but means also 'beloved by God', which obviously contradicts Salieri's personal sentiment before guiding all his vengeful actions  not against Mozart, but against God. Salieri is the personification of the inferiority complex which, when dangerously mixed with frustration, gives birth to evil. However, Salieri is probably one of the most sympathetic cinematic villains, because despite our reluctance to admit it, we can relate to his feelings. In this world, there are and have been more Salieris than Mozarts, this is God's implacable will, God who inspired Salieri a burning desire of revenge. And Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, brilliantly portrayed by Tom Hulce is the tool of Salieri's revenge. Salieri is a man who loves music, whose personal dream is to become famous and forever celebrated. He made a pact with God. He secretly gave him all his chastity, his humility for an extreme devotion to music, to be blessed by a musical talent that'll make him remembered as one of the greats. It's not surprising that Salieri was so eager to sacrifice all life's pleasures to achieve his goal. Salieri dreams of being celebrated, loved, through ages, and never to sink into oblivion, he'll never witness his dreams being fulfilled, but that doesn't matter, it's all about a mystical devotion to God for a posthumous rewarding. Unfortunately, God made other plans and all the musical grace Salieri dreamed of, was dedicated to another soul.And this is how Tom Hulce's interpretation of the titular role, as the second lead character of the movie plays a significant part. He's goofy, immature, has a unique giggle flirting with craziness, as to suggest the idea that genius is most often combined with insanity. After all, when Salieri tried to guess how this genius who wrote a concerto at 4, a symphony at 7, and an Opera at 12, would look like, he knew God wouldn't choose any human being to translate his divine beauty into music. And when he realizes this little, vulgar, constantly joking creature is the 'chosen one', his deception is so big his grief directly targets God, as he understands his tragically ironic fate : enough musical ear to be touched by Mozart's divine light, but not enough talent to reach it. In the crucial scene where he composes the little March for Mozart, he thanks God for inspiring him, with eyes filled of gratitude. When after one hearing, Mozart plays the exact melody with some humiliating improvements, Salieri thanks God again with a more ironic tone in his voice. The second humiliation occurs when Salieri finds out how Mozart's talent allowed him to 'possess' the Opera singer he's always jealously protected. Salieri has been stepped over two times with God as an accomplice. It became personal.We all had this feeling whether we believe in God or not, that everything is playing against us, whatever we try. God, luck, hazard, everything we lack is owned by one undeserving ungrateful person. This is the cardinal sin of envy, instead of being happy for someone, we're consumed by a constant desire to see this person lose everything. This attitude is due to one personal grief Salieri has against God, if he had plans for Mozart, why did he give him the musical conscience to realize his weakness, and more than that, why did he fill his heart with so much passion, and desire to create and to be remembered. The movie is told in flash-back, as a confession to a priest believing all men are created equal. 'Are they?' replies a skeptical older Salieri. Salieri knows about music, more than maybe any other character in this film and this sure helps the narrative to transcend the whole Salieri-Mozart rivalry. Never had music been so beautifully described in a film, hearing Salieri talking about Mozart's music is like floating in an ocean of notes where symphonic waves graciously swing under an air of emotions. It's like Mozart's music piercing the deepest part of our soul. After all, this is a movie about music, and music is like the fourth character of Forman's 'Amadeus'. With God as the third lead character. It's like a Holy Trinity haunting this film, with God, Mozart and the Holy Music, and poor Salieri as a pathetic but powerful Devil drown in the bitter lake of jealousy. God, has never been so omnipresent in a film, you hear him through the glorious finale of 'The Abduction of the Seraglio', to the enchantment of a 'Magic Flute' and the impressive solemnity of the 'Requiems', he never ceased to inhabit Mozart's music. But God was elsewhere, in Salieri's flaming eyes devoured by jealousy, where every drop of acid corroding Salieri's humanity was a tear to mourn his loss of faith.God appears through the two characters. Salieri even acts like a Biblical character elaborating a complicated but devious plan to kill God's divine creature. But as a protagonist of the film, God puts a term to Salieri's malicious scheme by killing his divine protégé and letting Salieri alive witnessing his creations falling in the abyss of memories. This is how Salieri felt things, but this is Salieri's film, and as viewers, we can't help but feel for Salieri's weaknesses. Mozart was his idol, and only he knew he was the greatest composer who ever lived, and he couldn't even share a part of his divine light, this was his doom.",10,1,2,7 February 2011
The Game," Sometimes heart-warming, sometimes heart-breaking ... always heart-pounding ...
","It's possible that 'The Game' asks too much on the 'suspension of disbelief' department, maybe it would be nearly implausible to come up with such a well-crafted, meticulous, and high-scale prank without an incident, that no hazardous 'what if' could have made the whole plot fall down, maybe.Yet it's nearly impossible not be thrilled by David Fincher's 'The Game' a film elevated above all the conventions of the action genre thanks to its inventive premise and Michael Douglas' central performance, both are strongly connected anyway. Douglas plays Nicholas Van Orton, and as the 'Van' clearly indicates, he's a rich and influent man. He's also one of these miserable loners leaving not much to envy, celebrating his 48th with one hamburger, a cupcake with one candle, and watching CNN on a big sofa, in a vast mansion where he lives alone, divorced and totally passionless. Acting as cold-hearted tyrant with his employees and servants, he strikes as a man who trusts no one and needs to keep things under his control.Only Douglas can make the alienating effect of excessive respectability and a sense of desperate misery coexist within the same character. A living paradox, Nicholas Van Orton is like a combo of Gordon Gekko and D-Fens. Yet, the film alternates between scenes where he vents his anger on his entourage and childhood flashbacks. Nicholas' father committed suicide when he was 48 and it surely affected Nicholas for the rest of his life. How do we know? Well, the script wouldn't have bothered to show it right in the beginning otherwise. If it was revealed later in the middle of the life-changing process, we'd have known that Nicholas could change. But we have to know the wound in his heart from the beginning, to understand that not only he can change, but needs to change.His brother Conrad (Sean Penn) is a more optimistic and down-to-earth character: his name-code to reach Nicholas is Seymour Butts and his gift to Conrad is no less original, a sort of game provided by CRS, a Consumer Recreation Services. The game is a life-changing experience combining fun and self-improvement, two things that cruelly lack in Nicholas' life. Visibly intrigued but not really enthusiastic, Nicholas promises to give a try. Coincidentally, he finds himself near the CRS' new headquarters and hears people talking about it. As one of the managers, played by the90's ultimate character-actor James Hebhorn says, 'it's the 'game that comes to you' and we sure had a glimpse. Nicholas is invited to forget his suspicion, to admit he's intrigued (and that's a clever wink to the audience by the screenplay) and that he's got nothing to lose, except one or two hours of medical and psychological tests, that would last longer naturally.It's so enjoyable to watch a control freak like character like Van Orton, pushed in weird to uncontrollable situations, gradually building the suspense. As soon as the game starts, it's a long descent into one of the most nightmarish cinematic experiences, driven by the growing conviction that anything, a waiter, a taxi cab, a cop, a man sitting in front of you, is part of it. What would you expect when even a TV anchorman talks to you or when you're lured into drinking a poisoned coffee by a woman who was not supposed to be part of the game? The paranoid feeling is efficiently conveyed by Fincher's directing, by borrowing some aspects from 'Seven', it does show a more shadowy and menacing face of San Francisco, and the film owes a lot to the subtle yet powerful performance by Douglas that puts us directly in his shoes..Yet as promising as the idea of a game that puts a client on one deadly situation after another sounds, the film couldn't have handled it for a 2-hour runtime. Indeed, even if 'The Game' expects a final twist, it has to mislead the viewer. After all, if a film is supposed to reveal that the bad guy is A, you have to suspect B and by personal deduction. The same goes with 'The Game' and proves Fincher's special talent to handle twist endings. If we take into consideration that Van Orton is a wealthy man, and that the whole game is a scheme to steal his money, then everything makes perfect sense. The script hooks us to this certitude until the end, where we realize that it was indeed a game that went wrong  enough to turn out to be successful. Believing that he accidentally killed his brother, Nicholas jumps off a high building and land in the right spot, on an inflated lifesaving cushion. The game is over and all the protagonists are here for a last 'Gotcha!'.This part is hard to believe for movie purists, but what would they have expected anyway? If you admit that CRS was always one step ahead of Van Orton, and could have predicted his reactions from his tests, if not believable, it seems plausible. Besides, it makes a whole sense to the character's arc, he had to be lonely man who had no other choice than being the way he was after his father's death, , to experience the same act of despair and realize that there's much to life than drowning his past on sad memories, when he opens his eyes, he's given a second chance. It's simple, believable, but the script if not a masterpiece of sophistication, is well-constructed enough to deliver what we'd expect and Douglas' performance turned it into something even more emotionally challenging.The film started with a man celebrating his birthday alone, and ends up with the same man celebrating his rebirth with all the people that count in his life. And in between, it's all suspense, thrills and mystery, what can you ask for more?",9,1,2,20 September 2012
Kick-Ass," 'Kick-Ass', symptomatic of what is wrong with film-making today ...
","With such a pretentious title, you would think you're gonna watch a comedy or a parody or a fun, entertaining action movie ... well, that's what I expected. The movie started with an excellent premise, a clever mix between 'Superbad' and any comic-book movie. In fact, I loved the plot idea of giving a chance to an average nobody to become a super-hero. With this mindset, I thought we'd have time to let the character grow on us, to feel sympathy for him, and to observe his evolution into a real original super-hero. I thought it would be a mix between a comedy with witty dialogs and funny visual gags and a heart-warming coming-of-age story. For me, that's the way the movie started ...And then, the tone radically changes. Big Daddy and his super little daughter make their entrance. I thought the pivotal moment would come from the hero, not from outsiders. No, it was like the director changed his mind and said 'let's not waste our time now, we've got to 'kick some ass', to shock, let's play ...' And then we see, two skilled superheroes who make you totally forget about the premise of the film ... We are supposed to discuss the believability of such heroes like Superman or Batman, aren't we? Then why, suddenly, the movie shows us one of the most dangerous and spectacular super heroines ever created with gadgets and Batmanesque weapons? a little girl who seemed to enjoy massacring people!!! what the hell was that?! the movie turned into an irresponsible mess, committed by a Tarantino wannabe. I'm sorry but as gruesome as the killings in 'Kill Bill' were, at least they had a 'point'. In this movie, the violence was so gratuitous, so disturbing, it was like the director was suffering from schizophrenia, let's start like a comedy, then evolves into an action film, and finish it as a thriller a la 'Dark Knight' ...Yes, violence should have a point. I have nothing against ultra-violence in movies as long as it serves a purpose. In this movie, it was some kind of dangerously influential, flashy and over-the-top violence ... is it cool to show a 11 year old, brainwashed by a fascist Daddy, cutting off a man's legs AND finding it delightful, is it entertaining ? were they 'bad guys' enough to be killed in such a merciless way? The movie became what it was trying to criticize in the beginning (in a very clever way) a superhero film, trying to be unique by mixing genres at a point I didn't even know how I was suppose to take the character, as Hancock or Bruce Wayne? I thought the gags were the best parts of the film ... and there were a few of them, mostly in the beginning (when it wasn't funny, I lost the interest and didn't care enough for the characters, it became monotonous)I also have nothing against genre bending, as long as it looks like a natural progression, not something thrown like this just for shocking value. The movie was just an excuse to mix between current bankable movie genres, teen comedies (well, the comedy deserted the movie after the first half-hour) action films and dark thrillers ... I didn't even take the movie as a parody, and I'm not sure the movie was supposed to be one. It used the same codes as a superhero flick in an very exaggerated way, and I would have found that funny, if the scenes were actually funny and I don't think they were. I didn't find the knife-stabbing funny, I didn't think it was a bad scene either, I felt sorry for the character and thought it was one of the most 'shockingly intelligent' moment from the film. There were too many 'serious' scenes in 'Kick-Ass' for me, to label it as a parody. The only thing 'original' was the genre-binding, but it was so artificial I didn't get what the director was trying to prove : normal people can be superheroes? no, they can't because real-life violence is not like in the comic books? no, actually, violence can be very fun and delightful if you're skilled and get the right weapons? I don't get what's so great with watching a 11-old-year girl, dress her like a 'Manga' schoolgirl (something clearly borrowed from 'Kill Bil'l) and let her kill the bad guys in the most gruesome way (whatever crime they committed, we're supposed to believe they have deserved it) with the ultimate insult : a classic Western Spaghetti score ... how unoriginal and distasteful. Violence is not cool, and is not supposed to be cool, and the greatest movies about violence, at one point showed its ugliness : 'Bonnie and Clyde', 'Pulp Fiction', 'The Dirty Dozen', 'The Wild Bunch', it's even insulting to mention these films in this review.'Kick-Ass', a flashy, dangerous, meaningless movie, symptomatic of what is wrong with film-making today ...",4,3,10,4 January 2011
The Man Who Would Be King," A Precursor of 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' made by John Huston...
","I challenge anyone to find me a movie where a European man insults and throws an Indian off a speeding train and even get a 'thank you' in return. Is it too offensive? Nah, it is offensive in such a silly way that being offended would be silly. Still, no director would dare to make such a move.And this is how refreshing it is to discover such gems four decades after they graced the screen. The scene I just described isn't even the highlight of 'The Man Who Would be King', John Huston's glorious adventure movie, but it serves to make my point, the film is fun and politically incorrect, so old-fashioned it is actually ahead of our time. Maybe John Huston found a parcel of liberty in the 70's that could allow him to explore all the colonial clichés for a great mix of humor and escapism, and the result is just too enjoyable and entertaining to inspire a negative reaction.And how could anyone snub a film that features the two most talented Englishmen of their generations, both associated to famous spy series (although movie lovers are more familiar with James Bond than Harry Palmer), both tall and strong guys, one blonde, one dark, and both with an instantly recognizable accent. Say what you want about Michael Caine and Sean Connery, but their chemistry is as believable and enjoyable as the way they complete each other, and have fun playing their respective roles. Peachy Carnehan (Caine) and Daniel Dravot (Connery) are two ex-Victorian soldiers, free masons, in quest for riches, hidden treasures, power and the pride from going further than the British Empire itself where the sun never set, but neither did the British foot in that remote country hidden behind the Afghan mountains: Kafiristan. Speaking Arabic and knowing that the term Kafir means pagan, it is very revealing of the place's hostility if no religion ever got there.And this is where the two men decide to go, and they take a young correspondent in India, named Rudyard Kipling (played by an unrecognizable Christopher Plummer) as a witness. They make a pact: to never drink or touch women until they conquer Kafiristan. The young Kipling warns them that no man ever went to these Godless cities after Alexander the Great, to which Peachy replies: if a Greek did it, we can. Indiana Jones was an adventurer but he was mostly driven by necessities and intellectual quests, here, you have two obvious antiheroes, driven by pride, greed, selfishness and yes so utterly convinced that they are in the right path, that we follow them with the same enthusiastic fun. And we see them venturing in these exotic lands full of beggars, snake charmers, old smoking soothsayers, crowded markets and some hints of the British civilization, but there's always more to see. That's the motto of adventurers and that's the curse of Hustonian heroes.I mentioned Indiana Jones but indeed, 'The Man Who Would be King' is such a brazenly entertaining and nicely nasty film that it would make you wonder why is it that 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is perceived as the one that resurrected the adventure genre. We have heart-pounding fight sequences, exotic locations that go from snowy mountains, road-stopping glaciers, from rocky deserts to inhabited oasis waiting for the civilization to 'bring order'. It has larger-than-life characters and meek, funny sidekicks like Saeed Jaffrey. The humor is sometimes racist and colonialist but it is done in such a free-spirited and comical way that it is obvious the joke is on the leads and this is typical of John Huston's movies, to distract us from the heroes' flaw by confronting them to worse people. And the two con-men are put in a place where a series of misunderstandings will allow them to be seen as Gods or kings, and just when you think you've seen all, the movie provides a completely new story in Kafiristan.And this is where lies my only 'problem' with the film, if problem is the word, I am Moroccan, so I can't be fooled by the shooting locations, the locals look nothing Indian or Afghans but pure Moroccan natives, but it's in the language that my suspension of disbelief was challenged, the people don't speak in Arabic but in Moroccan dialect, so I was pleasantly surprised to realize I could understand the people of Kafiristan. This doesn't really ruin the enjoyment and I appreciate the underrated performance of Moroccan then-star Larbi Doghmi (he'd also have a small but memorable role in 'The Black Stallion') as Ootah, he manages to steal the show, and when you have Caine and Connery, that means a lot. The population also does justice to the film, I didn't spot any smiling extras and some old men were into the role, so the whole thing works overall. But it was a little bit distracting.Huston wanted this project to star Bogart and Gable, but Bogart died, then it was Gable with Caine and Gable died, but this film couldn't have had a better pairing, the two Englishmen have a sort of Pythonesque detachment while still being into their characters, and somewhat this film is like a strange and bizarre masterpiece, so anachronistic that it manages to be beyond its temporality. It feels like an older film but the cynical tone is more modern than you'd think, and even the titles, gives away one of Huston's most cherished characters: people who lose, but never without trying, these cocky bastards are full of themselves, but what a price to pay for failure rather than a life of writing behind the desk.There's a discussion near a glacier where the two men prepare for their death and wonder whether they'd trade their lives for another, the answer is obvious and the laughs that follow are irresistible. This is a quintessential Hustonian moment.",8,2,7,17 November 2016
Ghostbusters," Only in the 80's, you could take bad spirits in good spirit...
","Just like 'Stayin' Alive' or 'Mrs. Robinson', Ray Parker Jr.' 'Ghost Busters' is one of these instantly identifiable songs as the first four seconds are enough to make you recall the lyrics that go along. Indeed, who doesn't know whom to call if in their neighborhood there's something strange. Ever since 1984, the movie has been a cultural phenomenon and speaking for myself, I learned to draw the iconic logo before I even saw the film.But let's get back to 1984. There's something very revealing about that year's ten highest- grossing movies, in order: 'Ghostbusters', 'Beverly Hills Cop', 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom', 'Gremlins', 'The Karate Kid', 'Police Academy', 'Footloose', 'Romancing the Stone', 'Star Trek III' and 'Splash'. Think about it, six comedies, variously overlapping with romance, adventure and horror, but still comedies; only two sequels, and one of them so over-the-top it is funny in it own twisted and politically incorrect way, the rest consists on a musical and a sports underdog film, typical feel-good movies.Those were the good old days, when the box-office champs weren't made of franchises fillers or heavyset blockbusters, when there was still room for originality, even of uneven quality, when the special effects driven movies didn't take themselves seriously and were more fun to watch than these depressingly square and clinical universes today's directors embark us in. Now that the 80's enter their thirties, we realize how entertaining, imaginative and fun they were. You went to the movies to have a good time.And if there ever is one film that encapsulates that spirit, it's the story of three outcast parapsychologists with gray uniforms chasing ghosts with a vacuum-like device attached to packers. Of course, it sounds better as 'Ghost Busters' and much cooler with the logo that became a defining sign of the 80's, one I'll take before any Batman or Superman shield. Seriously, let these guys fight together, I'd rather have a hot-dog stuffed green monster charging at Bill Murray, and sliming him in the process. Forget the truth, justice and the American way, some psychic nuisances and a trio of misunderstood weirdos will do.And 'Ghostbusters' is a movie made by performers who knew what the 80's was about, what the public wanted and it doesn't come as a surprise that these guys come from TV. It was a project written by SNL alumni Harold Ramis and Dan Aykroyd with John Belushi in mind, but his untimely passing entailed many changes in the script. And with gentlemanly class, Ramis and Aykroyd let the lion share of one- liners to Bill Murray, giving him the role his comical legacy needed: a wisecracking scientist named Dr. Peter Venkman, such a constant jerk-ass you can't even tell if HE can tell whether he's serious or not.Ramis plays Egon Spengler, the egghead and Ayrkyod is Raymond Stantz, the good friend and most emotionally involved of the three. You have the trio made of the mind, the heart and the crazy spirit, and their chemistry is the key to the film's success. They're later joined by Ernie Hudson, who plays Winston Zeddmore, the everyman of the group, and to some extent, the needed 'voice of reason'. A lot has been said about the way Hudson was treated by the film's marketing, but I don't think the race card is to be brandished here. And there's something oddly original in the way a significant character pops up halfway through the narrative.The film also counts on nice supporting performances. There's Sigourney Weaver as Dana Barrett, a cellist who's the 'first to call', after witnessing some strange phenomena in her kitchen. There's also a familiar face of the 80's, Rick Moranis as Louis Tully, the meek and geeky accountant who's obviously infatuated with his beautiful neighbor. For some reason, she unable to see what he's got to offer, and the eight inches between them don't help. She also doesn't call Venkman's 'romantic' tirades but the ghost storyline finds a smart way to reassemble these two romantic subplots, when Dana is demonically possessed by a spirit.And Venkman's reactions to her exorcist-like condition proves at least one thing, it takes a lot to shake the guy. And that's the most brilliant aspect about the film, the special effects can satisfy any sucker for horror or Sci-fi movies but the fact that the three players handle it as pure routine is a great example of tongue-in-cheek humor and a subtle satire on New York's inner wackiness. After all, where else can you see a TV ad about ghost busting? I also love how the blasé secretary played by Annie Potts doesn't even question their works, and when she asks Winston whether he believe in these things, he tells her that for money, he'd believe anything (I thought there was a waste here for a funnier line but never mind). Everyone is so crazy that the closest to come to a sane person is the antagonist, an EPA lawyer who had all the reasons not to trust these guys who use radioactive material for their jobs. But only William Atherton, the soon-to-play Thornbug in 'Die Hard' could have made himself more unlikable than jerk-ass Bill Murray, and he's the one who by turning off the power that stocked all the taken slime, liberated them and turned New York into the outlet of the most demonic presences, using Dana's building as a channel. We get then to a climactic showdown, whose special effects might distract from the comedy for a little while, but not too long.Indeed, the masterstroke comes from the form taken by the evil presence, and this is the stuff iconic movies are made of. 'Ghost Busters' isn't without flaws, but they're of such microscopic and negligible nature compared to its iconic magnitude, that the film works as a 'Critics Buster' too.",8,6,10,6 May 2016
Gran Torino," Love Your Neighbor as Yourself ...
","'Gran Torino' is the prize that Walt Kowalski received, a recognition for his forty-something years as an autoworker in the Ford company. It's big, bad-ass, virile, and 100% made in America  and so is Walt Kowalski.Walt Kowalski is pure Clint Eastwood, with his deadly stances, recurring growls and unique ability to look mean and mean business when he points his shotgun on you. Indeed, when Walt Kowalski utters his 'Get off my lawn' catchphrase, you can see the heart of Dirty Harry fiercely burning in his eyes, you understand he would defend his property as zealously as Harry for San Francisco's citizens, and that his shotgun is no less menacing than a certain legendary Magnum. This is the Eastwood way, and it's a remarkable credit to his talent that he was able to create such an unforgettable character after Dirty Harry, The Man With No Name, William Munny, to name a few.But the film needed a less bigger-than-life, more ordinary character, if that word could ever been used to describe Eastwood (which man wouldn't dream of looking like him at his late 70's?). The principal issue tackled by 'Gran Torino' is the innate loneliness of a man lost in his era, the product of a generation born with a certain idea of America, life, men and women. Walt is the typical macho conservative; he enjoys beer, sitting in his balcony with his dog and hanging out with buddies to exchange some crude, racist and homophobic jokes. He's grumpy by nature but the loss of his wife made things even worse and widened the gap between him and his family. The movie opens with his wife's funeral and you can tell how disgusted he is by his grandchildren's playful and insolent behavior. Yet his anger is only an expression of lucidity; he knows he's just a senile old fool for both adults and kids and a promising heritage  with four wheels.And it's important that we share this lucidity because racism in movies is the least likely trait to inspire sympathy yet Eastwood makes it work. Indeed, in the specific case of Walt, if we don't empathize, at least we understand that the man is not viscerally racist but just distant from whatever underlines a difference: his own family is different, let alone strangers. And Walt is so alienated that he can't perceive difference among the others and therefore display an equal level of hostility toward everyone. He fought Koreans in the 50's and like many others narrow-minded bigots, he doesn't make any difference between Japanese, Chinese or Koreans, and although Sue, the sensitive neighbor who felt there was something good inside Walt's heart, insisted that the Hmong are a mountain people from Laos, Walt couldn't care less. They all are 'gooks' or 'chinks', or in the best case 'strangers'.Sue plays a pivotal role as an open-minded girl who understands that Walt's heart is not such an unreachable wall of stones. In the beginning, when the Hmong settle, a simple look at Walt's face gives us an idea about his thought, and the movie flirts with comedy by creating a sort of tacit rivalry between him and the Hmong grandma, when she spitted on the ground, the audience cheered in the theater as if Walt found his match. People genuinely loved Walt not for what he was but despite what he showed to be. He exuded a virile charisma so magnetic that all the meanness was pardonable. Only Eastwood could embody this mix of macho toughness and poignant loneliness. And ironically, this loneliness would eventually cement the friendship with Thao, Sue's younger brother, a calm and studious adolescent and an easy target for his delinquent cousins.Thao represents the total opposition with Walt in every single aspect: culture, generation, personality, they couldn't be more different. But they have one thing in common: they are loners, not by necessity, it's in them. Walt is a stranger for his own Family, as is Thao, surrounded by women and a domineering sister. His manipulability leads him to Walt when he's ordered to steal the Gran Torino for his cousins. Walt forgives but in the Hmong's tradition, it would take more to redeem Thao's action: he must work for Walt. The insistence of the Family wins over Walt's reluctance, and seals the beginning of a bond that would become more and more palpable, even if it's never explicitly expressed. And through the Hmong, Walt discovers a part of himself that was probably repressed for a long time and that put the whole meaning of strangers into perspective as he embraces the curious traditions of his neighbors. And the characterization and interaction featured in the second act are a remarkable example of great film-making as Eastwood found the perfect dosage between sweetness and drama in the mentor/tutorship relationship with Thao.Of course, Eastwood knew we'd know that a hard nose like Walt wouldn't be utterly bad, there had to be a heal to conceal, and that was the hidden element the late Mrs. Kowalski sensed and asked the youngish Father Janovich to discover. While Janovich was immediately dismissed in the opening funeral, he discovered a new Walt capable of opening his heart at the end. But even this aspect is dealt in a clever and unpredictable way. Stereotypical situations wouldn't have ruined the spirit of the film though, because from the character of Walt, we also knew the movie wouldn't end with the kind of sappy happy ending. However, the last shot remains a wonderful tribute to the mysterious mechanisms of love, as we understand what the Gran Torino is about, and only Clint Eastwood could have made such an inspiring message about tolerance without sentimentalism.Who knows? maybe in forty years, we would have a film about an old racist Gulf War veteran who discovers the lifestyle of Muslim neighbors to realize that they are not as bad as they seem.",9,1,2,9 March 2012
Shrek the Third," Far far away... from the first two movie's level...
","In his review of 'Shrek 2', Ebert made a very interesting remark, he said that he might have loved the film more if it was the first. By this logic, we can take it that popularity is inversely proportional to the position within the trilogy, with a few exceptions. In the case of 'Shrek' franchise, it wouldn't do justice to the original movie to say that the third one plays on the same league, I'm not even sure it plays on the second's league either.Again, it's far from being a bad movie, but it seems like the zany creativity that inhabited the animators had been transferred to some newer and fresher projects. In the end, it's not difficult to point out what went wrong with 'Shrek the Third', there were worrying signs already in the second film. 'Shrek 2' was funny, original and featured the addition of Puss in Boots, but the main plot was very similar to the first, and the challenge of Shrek being accepted by his in-laws, wasn't the most exciting from a child's standpoint. Yet it worked because of the vital addition of new characters, especially Puss in Boots.In 'Shrek the Third', you have the same characters; Charming replaces his mother in the villainous role so it's a good thing they didn't kill him off in the second one. Shrek and Fiona live in Far Far Away, happily we're tempted to say except that Fiona wants children and Shrek feels like he's not ready for it. Even TV dramas try to avoid these clichés like the plague but the writers thought this would make a good set-up. And it is a situation many people can relate too, but children? Shrek and Fiona act like a normal couple, too normal for the story's own good. But things start happening, a dying King Harold names Shrek as his only heir, but the ogre doesn't feel like King material (tell that to a frog), he learns that the only one who can sit on the throne, is Arthur. Yes, THE king Arthur. Why not after all, The start is a little slow but at that point, there's still some hope that we're heading toward an interesting quest, but despite all the film's efforts, each idea falls flat, at least by the first film's standards. Charming meets all the Fairy Tales villains in a tavern (Hook, the Queen etc.) and they form a sort of squad determine to take the ultimate revenge against their respective antagonists, fair enough, but too many villains make their characterization superficial and only foils for punctual gags. The same with the discovery of Arthur in a college, it starts well, but the way Shrek manages to convince the frail and insecure Arthur voiced by Justin Timberlake, feels rather anticlimactic.On its way home, the ship runs aground an Island where they meet Merlin and the Island sequence is the occasion for some heart-to-heart talk about responsibilities, Shrek realizes that Artie's reluctance to become a King reflects his own attitude toward fatherhood. As an adult, I found that part well-written although predictable, it's precisely because Shrek is such a fully developed character that I was drawn into it can't say I cared for Arthur. But the question is not whether I like it, but whether kids would. Themes of responsibility and self-questioning are relevant, but not when you go to see an ogre story set in a medieval fantasy world. To make it worse, even the fight sequence between the heroes and the villains has a feeling of déjà-vu. Show us something we don't see coming.And when our heroes use Merlin's magic to go back to Far Far Away, one side-effect consists on Donkey and Puss exchanging their bodies, and that's perhaps the only memorable use of the two sidekicks, but it's not saying much, because there's never a point where this reversal plays a pivotal role to the story, to distract the enemy or something else, it's just an excuse for one or two funny one-liners and that's all. The exchange bit (and its mildly amusing punch line) illustrates how imagination has slipped. In the end, there's no memorable line from either Antonio Banderas and Eddie Murphy, and Shrek isn't strong enough to carry the whole film, and certainly not Artie with his frail shoulders, and his capricious and inconsistent persona. We're Far Far Away from the level of the first film.There was one little bit that worked though, the subplot involving Fiona and the fairy tales heroines, immortalized by Disney: Snow White, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty to name the most instantly recognizable. I must say it was quite fun to see them talking and behaving like the real housewives of Beverly Hills before turning into Charlie's Angels, so for the first time, they wouldn't wait for any Prince or hero to save the day. But it's the same problem than the villain, too many characters. Basically, the film is overflowed by its creatures, even the little sidekicks Pinocchio, Wolf, the Three Pigs must join the show creating the most confusing feeling of chaos, weakening even more the climax that should have consisted on one confrontation, like in the first and to some extent, the second.But six years have passed between these films and many other DreamWorks films so my guess is that even the creators knew they weren't making a masterpiece. And it's very revealing that the DVD features don't even bother to show any interviews of the makers. So, maybe it's the kind fo movie to look at with forgiving eyes, and I wonder if the ending montage wasn't meant to a little self-parodying. As a recent father, I could totally relate to the milk preparations, the diaper changing (with growing dexterity) and especially the 'what next?' bit. But then, I was thinking what's next indeed? Shrek looking for a job? Midlife Crisis? An affair with Dragon?",6,0,1,30 July 2016
The Hurt Locker," The Nerve-Wracking Routine of Daily Bomb-Defusing Missions...
","The Height of Suspense is When Any Second Can Turn the Place into Chaos or Not It is quite ironic that the very year the Academy decided to extend the number of Best Picture nominees from five to ten didn't have more than three or four real gems to endorse. It is as if 'The Hurt Locker' became the embodiment of a weak year and didn't win Oscars but rather stole them from more deserving movies like 'Avatar' or 'Inglourious Basterds'. Kathryn Bigelow took her former husband's Oscar for Best Directing and the film won the Best Picture while that should have belonged to Tarantino at least, according to IMDb Top 250, not me, anyway.Less flashy and more powerful than Tarantino's work, 'The Hurt Locker' is a simple, straightway journey that chronicles the missions of the bomb squad in Iraq during the first years of that infamous war that shouldn't have happened. That this war is deemed as pointless and meaningless is a reality perfectly captured through two of the third leading characters Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Eldridge (Brian Geraghty). Vietnam War wasn't more meaningful and the GI's weren't much loved, but all through 'The Hurt Locker', the squad deals with a new kind of warfare, one that turned the city into a giant hideout for bombs, of any sorts and any devices trapped in the most banal and sneaky places, such as car trunks, trash bins and even dead bodies.This is a war where the enemy is invisible because once the bomb is there, whoever put it can be anywhere, he can even be close to the soldiers or staring at them from the top of a mosque or a building, it is a task of Herculean level to spot the bomber, and most of the time, they get away with it, because the staff generally deals with the bombs, the sources of never-ending stress. You can disarm a bomb on Monday, another one will still await you on Tuesday, there's no such thing as calling it a day or taking a break, there's never a routine, each bomb is new, each one can be the last one, and the film opens with a specialist (Guy Pearce) killed in a mission, proving that this job is almost like life, you are only remembered for you final achievements, and no matter how many bombs you defused, you'll be an expert or a hero for as long as you survive.When the rotation is over, you can get back to life but if someone believes this is a consolation thing, he's got another notion coming to him. This is a day-by day situation, it maintains a state of demented stress among the soldiers and this is the hellish aspect of the Iraqi War. There's not a week now without news about a terrorist attack in Iraq, it became a common practice, and in a way, the Americans who were there had a taste of what the civilians must go through now, and they don't even have a rotation to count on. A war movie can't ignore the state of mind as much as it can't ignore the state of war, and from the editing, the way the camera switches places, go back and forth, flying over a vast place where anything is possible, we can have antaste of the nervousness the soldiers go through, when any second can turn places into chaos.But had 'The Hurt Locker' focused on the danger, it would have been a routine war movie. In 'The Hurt Locker', danger is brilliantly diluted in reality, it even ceases to exist, except from the way it is anticipated by soldiers, and above them all, the new Staff Sergeant William James (Jeremy Renner). This is a hero in the sense that he defused more hundreds of s bombs, and developed a sort of instinct, a capacity for observation and understanding that make him take impossible risks, much to the anger of his two companions (Sanborn even contemplated the idea of killing James) but they can't complain because he's competent. The film opens with a quotation about war being a drug, and it's never as palpable as when you see the concentrated eyes on Renner's face, his no-nonsense way to deal with bombs, with his ordinary looks that recall a young Jim Belushi. This is a guy with an attitude but never gratuitous, he earns his cockiness.The action is repetitive but never redundant, one of the most archetypal action-movie situation is explored to the fullest, repeated as many times as it takes to have the ultimate psychological effect on the trio, pushing their perceptions to the edge, until they start reconsider their own certitudes, and the common thread is always James, a competent man who wanders in hell thanks to the one thing he loves: defusing bombs. And there's nothing more exhilarating than a character who's really good at something. James is one of them, and we love the film for that paradoxical feel, as much as we're happy not to be in his boots, we admire him and wish we could be as expert in any field as he is, this is guy who found what he loves and acts accordingly too, it's a job full of adrenaline or risks.See, 'The Hurt Locker' is a complex movies with a relative visual simplicity, at a first stance, it is about soldiers assigned the same mission in a hostile place, when you dig deeper, it's about men doing their job, not out of love of patriotism, but because that's what they feel they're meant to do, or what they're meant to do. There's no escape, they can only count on luck, and let time do the job, their life is like a ticking bomb, and they all hope for the explosion to come as late as possible, or at least, to expect it when it comes.",9,0,1,10 March 2017
Moulin Rouge!," Oh La La Land...
","When I was a student, our marketing teacher told us an anecdote about one of our predecessors who, after finishing school, started quite an unusual business; he bought grants for operating licenses, allowing him to improve a brand and its value before selling it with a capital gain. One of his first clients was the owner of a cabaret whose fading reputation made him lose money and customers and needed a real rejuvenation treatment. It was the Moulin Rouge.Legend has it that, once he owned the rights, the secretary of a young Australian director called him, asking for the permission to use the name for the title and the setting of a movie. Needless to say that it boosted the 'Moulin Rouge' image for a whole new century and our young businessman made enough money not to need another job. I don't know how much has been amplified by the passing of years, but I love to think of fate as a crazy Can-Can dancer with a perfect timing; a pivotal business at a pivotal moment of the history of musicals, in fact of movie-making.Wikipedia states that 'Moulin Rouge!' was the first musical to be nominated for Best Picture after ten years, the last being 'Beauty and the Beast'. While Disney's classic is a great musical, the novelty of its nomination had more to do with its status as an animated movie, so while not disregarding it, I would say that Baz Lurhmann's 'Moulin Rouge!' is a mini-milestone as the first live-action musical in twenty-two years since Bob Fosse's 'All That Jazz'. When it came out, the 'love-letter-to-Hollywood' wasn't 'all that jazz' yet, the film took everyone off guard, shook up the conventions of the genre with such gusto that it might have undermined the chances to win the Best Picture Oscar. The more conventional 'Chicago' would, over such heavy contenders as two epics and a holocaust movie.There wouldn't be one streak of ten years without a musical, but 'Les Miserables' didn't win the coveted prize and recently front-runner 'La La Land', was knocked out at the last minute by 'Moonlight', so maybe the love for musicals have faded a little, and viewers are more attached to conventional forms of storytelling, as long as the stories are unconventional. Maybe that's the problem of musicals: they use unconventional narratives stories that can't wow our cynical eyes. And maybe the reason why I was so ecstatic after 'Chicago' was because the story was still enjoyable without the music. 'Moulin Rouge!' uses a clever exclamation mark to distance itself from John Huston's eponymous film and emphasizing its treatment of the iconic place, but beyond all the glitz and extravaganza the film is wrapped in, the story is rather conventional and its notability film is mostly dependent on all the choreographic achievements and frenetic editing.Indeed, 'Moulin Rouge!'' plot can be summed up in one paragraph: a struggling writer named Chrsitian (Ewan McGregor) falls in love with Moulin Rouge's sensation, the courtesan named Satine (Nicole Kidman) but their romance is undermined by the sneaky mustached Duke of Monroth (Richard Boxborgh). So, they use the process of writing a spectacular spectacle (deliberate pleonasm) as a decoy to their forbidden love but the Duke's jealousy and Satine's illness (she's suffering, actually dying, from tuberculosis) escalates to the obligatory emotional climax. The story is well-acted but its plot is like a clothesline where to hang musical numbers, but that's not to diminish the appeal of the film because it is in a class of its own, on that level and one's got to hand it to Lurhmann to have opened the streak of musicals with possibly the least conventional one.Lurhmann was the son of a dance choreographer and theater owner and like Bob Fosse who was a dancer; you can tell that it injected a real musical instinct in the young director. The film is a dazzling and vertiginous series of musical vignettes directed by a majestic ringmaster played by Jim Broadbent in an unprecedented role since Joel Grey in 'Cabaret'. There's not a single shot lasting more than ten seconds. It is a spectacle that paradoxically endorses the codes of musicals as tragic romances but that invent something that appeal to the MTV and clip generation. The result is odd and avant-garde and might disorient the fans of the more traditional form of storytelling. But don't get it wrong, this is not the kind of musical that would have looked better in Broadway, if anything, it highlights the status of movies as a unique way of storytelling.Indeed, you can't have such dramatic changes of costumes, such heavy jump cuts in a play, but here, they're indispensable for the film's hyperbolic vitality. The editing of is one of the most rhythmically fact you'll ever witness but it's a double-edge sword. The paradox is that the film might not hold up in theaters, many users said they left the audience because they've had an overdose so maybe this is a film that benefit from a viewing, one where you have a remote control. Still, if you're patient enough to get to the end, you will see that the film is not without a strong emotional resonance. Maybe that wouldn't have been possible had it featured traditional can-cans and a gloomier Toulouse-Lautrec (unlike Leguizamo's) but it couldn't be just a retread of the Paris we know.Believe me, as someone who lived in Paris and not far from the Pigalle quarter where the cabaret is set, I knew there was an eternal gap between the Paris you imagine and the real one, Paris is never as dazzling as in the realm of our imagination and what can be more imaginative than a medley of songs that go from 'Queen' to Kurt Cobain in Paris' 1900. It's crazy, sick irreverent and grotesque but hey, for the sake of entertainment no holds are to be barred.",8,1,3,4 March 2017
Ex Machina," Diabolicus Ex Machina...tion!
","Written and directed by Alex Garland, 'Ex Machina' proves once again that the science fiction genre is naturally prone to raise disturbing and thought-provoking questions about our mortality and how human intelligence can be the only possible key to triumph over it. If you look at movies like '2001', 'Frankenstein', 'Terminator 2' or 'Blade Runner', you'll find as a common denominator a humanity trying to survive or challenge itself by playing God, and creating a very advanced technological device or an artificial intelligence that will inevitably backfire, that's the narrative of most sci-fi classics, it's always about technological hubris.There's a scene when discovering that his employer has created an advanced form of artificial intelligence (AI), young trainee Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) says 'it's not the history of men, but the history of Gods'. You can see his eyes shining with sparkles of admiration in front of the 'idol'. His name is Nathan, his face like a mug shot from of an ISIS suspect but Oscar Isaac delivers one of the finest and most credible performances of recent years as a self-centered genius so intelligent he's actually blasé about it. Nathan lives in an estate so big it takes two hours to fly over it and a house confined in some unknown geographical area where he spends his time as if he was some big campus animal party but listen to him talking and you'll know he means business. He reinvents the role of the 'mad scientist', no nerdy looks, no manic mimics, no scientific jargon, he's actually the one who asks Caleb to stop talking as if he was in a seminar. The dynamics between Nathan and Caleb might be the best thing about the film, which is saying a lot.Caleb is the chosen one, an engineer in Nathan's Blue Book company, a sort of combo of Facebook and Google that earned a big fortune through search engines, officiously using the same fraudulent methods than the competitors, which made it immune to any suing. Nathan hired Caleb for a week to proceed to a Turing Test with his late creation: Ava, a female robot whose artificial intelligence was made from billions of data gathered from cell phones and social networks. Ava is played by Alicia Vikander and I will comment her performance by saying it's perhaps the closest full-skin version of Hal 9000. Caleb points out that knowing she's a robot might create a bias because in the test, you're not supposed to know. Nathan explains that if he didn't interact with her in face-to-face sessions, he would have the illusion of being with a human and the point is to spot hints of consciousness despite the certitude that she's an AI. That's exactly how Vikander's performance plays on an Oscar-winning level.And the film works on three levels as well: first, it's a wonderful screenplay and you just enjoy the exchanges between Nathan and Caleb and the statements they speak about human various form of interactions and what spoken or body language can reveal about our intelligence and humanity. There's a wonderful dialogue about sex and how it's deeply connected with gender-awareness and whether it's true or not is besides the point, it makes you process personal thoughts while following the plot. The second level is in the way these lines are delivered and what they say about the speakers, one is too cocky and arrogant, one is shy and insecure and this is pivotal for the test, it's human factor, and how it can affect one's notion about AI. The third element is that the plot is so smart, you're trying to outsmart it, to anticipate its moves like in a chess game. Nathan has all the makings of a villain, and Ava creating short cuts to avoid his surveillance to tell Caleb that he shouldn't trust Nathan were predictable moves. But we're all smart enough to think it was too convenient that Nathan wouldn't do nothing about these inconveniences. And while I was busy trying to anticipate who from Nathan and Caleb would outsmart the other, I also enjoyed the interactions with Ava. She's obviously 'infatuated' with Caleb but when you look at Nathan's behavior and discover the extent of his egomania, there's no way to anticipate that Ava is the real one to fear. But at the end, you realize that everything made sense, the film is conceived in order to make you try to outsmart Nathan until we're all being outsmarted by Ava. And it's fascinating because it's that precise level of intelligence that betrays her, her cruelty toward her own savior. It all comes down to Ava being either a robot or a psychopath. But it took me a second viewing to appreciate the ending a little more. At first, I thought it was a cheap attempt for spectacular gore betraying a serious lack of inspiration, but finally, it's the perfect twist because it shows the limits of the artificial intelligence; it can lead to manipulation and vileness, a vileness even scarier because not meant as evil, but as an automatic defensive move. The point of the Turing test was to spot an action that wouldn't be deemed as automatic and in fact, it's the real flaw of the reasoning from both Nathan and Caleb. If the goal is to find an action that doesn't have a specific reason to be, an automatism, how about a non automatic action whose goal is to make humans believe it's not automatic, once you can think of simulation, the case was hopeless. An AI can pretend to be human if it meant its survival, conservation instinct can be a better driver than love. There are Pollocks and there are hacks. Anyone can be manipulated.I think the script is so intelligently manipulative, so multi-layered and so smart Garland himself would be outsmarted by it, like his own AI.",9,1,4,22 December 2017
Back to the Future Part III," Back to the Old West ... Back to the Roots ... Back to the Future ...
","And here comes the conclusion of one of the finest and most likable cinematic trilogies: 'Back to the Future Part III', more than a sequel, a resourcing in the spirit that made the first film such an endearing classic, with an even more escapist value in the setting, the Far West during the 1880's. As a Sci-Fi Family Romantic Comedy, 'Back to the Future Part III' is already a winner, but the Western is the defining aspect of its originality. 'Back to the Future Part III' was directly made after the second, basically recycling the same material, and using the same team, the same casting etc. The continuity between the two films is so determining that there's no way watching the second without getting immediately to the third, it's like keeping in touch with the same family. Indeed, as much as I can watch the first one alone, because it's a class on its own and a film I consider slightly independent from the two sequels, on the other hand, I consider the sequels too connected to each other not to be seen in a row. This continuity helps to appreciate the second part that feels more like a link between the two other films while 'Part III' resurrects the spirit of the first one by focusing on the emotionality rather than the eternal 'back to the future' mission.This has always been Marty's preoccupation and the thrust of the trilogy but the travels also had the merit to solve some familial issues and help a beloved character to improve something in his life, if anything, the trilogy defines the notion of 'coming-of-age' as the inspirational aspect of the film, its encouragement for success through self-improvement. But since people were facing less materialistic issues than during the 80's, I guess there was a need to take some distance from these so-called philosophies of successes and a huge step back one century earlier when the 80's followed the Secession War and preceded the Industrial Revolution that would lead to demise of the frontier spirit. The Far West is less a setting or an era, than a state of mind, embodying the roots of the American spirit in its purest form, before greed and profit perverted its meaning. The Far West setting perfectly fitted the tormenting desire of Doc Emmett Brown for retirement and a tacit existential quest for love.Consequently, while the central character of the first film was George McFly and the second part focused on the McFly Family, Gale and Zemeckis took the last film as a great opportunity to enrich the character of Doc Brown and close his story's arc through a love story in order to replace the 'mad scientist' label by a necessary element of three-dimensionality. On the surface, Marty's mission is to prevent Brown from being killed by the villain who â€“for our greatest delight- is Biff's ancestor, Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen, but while Marty and Doc try to find a solution to push the DeLorean to 88 mph, destiny puts them in Clara's path. So Doc meets Clara Clayton (Mary Steenburgen), a teacher whose fate was to fall in the Shonash ravine canyon and give it a posthumous name.At that point of the trilogy, we're all aware of the time travels' mechanisms, we can even be surprised by Marty's incapability 'to reason fourth-dimensionally', who he traveled so much. But here, the film invites us to put all the scientific stuff into perspective and think of the real elements that predefine our fates. There's a strong philosophical material hidden behind the love story as the film concludes its approach on time travels with the idea that nothing is written except by our free will and our capacity not to let external elements direct our lives. But I may make the film sound too intellectual when it's also a great comedy and one hell of a western.The film is the opportunity to rediscover and say goodbye to the wonderful characters of Hill Valley, to see the first McFlys in American land, to witness the inauguration of the clock tower which, as Doc said, was fitting that he and Marty could witness, not to mention Marty pretending to be named Clint Eastwood, at the risk of tarnishing this name by becoming the biggest yellow belly in the Old West. And the delight on the comedic level is in the way the humor works on a meta-referential level as if the film was breaking an imperceptible fourth wall, playing on its own trademarks. I can't resist to the scene where Marty, realizing that he might be killed instead of Doc utters a 'Great Scott' followed by Doc's comment 'I know this is heavy', when Marty wonders why they always have to 'cut these things so damn close' or when, in the most dramatic situations, he reacts by an ironic 'perfect'.And speaking of dramatic, the film also provides great thrilling moments you'd expect from a Western, and probably the most heart-pounding climax from the trilogy with the train sequence, so suspenseful, I remember I had to pause for seconds the first time I watched it. This was one of the few times, I needed to take a break because it was just too suspenseful, but what a fitting and rewarding conclusion. Action, escapism, duels, stage, rides, Indians, cavalry, 'Back to the Future Part III' is also an independent homage to the Western genre with some exhilarating moments, served by Alan Silvestri's terrific score, probably his best work in the trilogy.And this is why I consider 'Back to the Future' as the greatest trilogy after 'The Godfather' with a slight advantage that remains the consistency in terms of spirit, thrills, laughs and emotional value. So thank you Robert Zemeckis, Bob Gale, Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd and all the team for these three unforgettable classics!",9,14,14,9 October 2011
Patton," An Anachronic state of mind for a Universal aura ...
","Franklyn Shaffer's 'Patton' opens with its most emblematic image: General George S. Patton Jr. played by the coincidentally namesake George C. Scott, standing in front of a giant American flag, to deliver one of the greatest cinematic speeches. Yet the film is too 'intelligent' to be labeled as gratuitously patriotic. The Best Picture winner of 1971 is a thought-provoking exaltation of warfare through the portrayal of a man who loved his country but loved fighting even more, and embraced victory with such passion he became its own incarnation. General De Gaulle began his Memoir by stating: 'All my life, I had a certain idea about France '. In the same vein, Patton's speech expresses a certain idea, ideal, of America, a domineering and strong country crystallizing all the prestigious characteristics of the previous victorious nations. Half-mad, half-genius, General Patton believed in reincarnation, a faith driven by the passion in History that nourished his mind with the exploits of Caesar, Hannibal, Napoleon, Frederick the Great, and to a certain extent, even an enemy like Rommel, whom he read the book, was respected for his war tactics. 'I was there' loved to retort Patton, referring to historical battles, with a crazy smirk that no one ever dared to contradict. In his mind, America was the Roman Empire's reincarnation that provided him the ultimate opportunity to finally fulfill his dreams of conquest, victory and prestige. More than pro-American, he's supra-American: his ideals indeed transcended the limited barriers of a nation; as he repeated, he's not a politician, and certainly not a diplomat, his job is to fight, and to lead his Army to Victory, victory or annihilation. 'The very thought of losing is hateful to Americans', which gets me back to the opening scene. There's so much to say about it this marvelous piece of 'inspirational brainwashing', written by an Oscar-winning Francis Ford Coppola.I say 'brainwashing', because the words work, there's something authoritarian in this unique raspy voice that resonates in the hearts of all the listeners. I'm sure it made many Americans proud to have had such a great leader and non-American wish they could have such a leader. I'm sure many of us younger generation, wished we could prove our value on the battlefield and as for the anti-war people, there's still a possibility to admire a man who was faithful to his principles. Feared or respected, I don't think there was a way not to admire the man, even secretly. Hell, even the enemy admired George Patton.And how couldn't they? Patton was a bigger-than-life foul-mouthed idealist, in other words: a natural-born leader. And the genius in Scott's performance relies on the way we never cease to doubt over Patton's capability to win the War, and his unpopularity among his own peers, make him all the more appealing. No General would have slapped a weeping officer, victim of shell-shock, and whether Patton was right or wrong to do what he did in the second most emblematic scene of the film, we feel that it's precisely the kind of behavior that only a great man would have done. A great nation needs a great army, therefore great soldiers. Ego? Yes, but indispensable to inculcate this very 'idea of America'.'They never know when you're acting and when you're not' says an aide, pointing out Patton's talent, he's convincing and his convincing craziness is the expression of his ferocious attachment to his personal vision. Did all the great men believe in God? I don't know but I'm sure they did believe in Destiny, therefore on a mysterious God-like vision that wrote the course of events in the right way. Did all the great men believe in Destiny? It's precisely what made them great, their ability to foreshadow the future, to see what had to be done. Patton was a visionary. He had his opinion on the war in Europe, on the conflict with the Russians, and he knew that a man like him was born to meet his Destiny. Beyond George C. Scott's magnificent performance, there's also Francis Ford Coppola's gripping script (we can't help but feel that Lieutenant Kilgore from 'Apocalypse Now' owes to Scott's portrayal) and paralleling the War, if one can't be lost given the right leader, right artillery, spirit, weapons, a movie with the right writing, directing, music –who can forget Jerry Goldsmith's catchy tune- and acting, can't fail either. But although it had a fair deal of supporting performances, apart from Karl Malden's depiction of Omar Bradley, no one could hold a candle to Scott. He carried the film and embodied to the most infinite details Patton's charisma. Even when he defied the Academy by refusing his Award, there was a sort of Patton-esque irreverence in Scott's attitude. And Scott indeed made me believe that one man can change the course of War. Ironically, Scott was so omnipresent that the best scenes to give insights about his aura belonged to the German side, starting by Rommel's decision to wipe out Patton's army before he did so, you could tell in his eyes when he was told about Patton that he realized he met his match. In another scene, a General expresses his disbelief that the American Army would ban Patton because of a vulgar slap, and at the end, you could clearly see a respect toward the 'pure warrior', and 'living anachronism', a Master of War who could only be destroyed by an absence of War.Anachronism, yes  'Patton' also respected his enemies, as they belonged to the same race: fighters. With his vision of chivalry, bravura, he despised the bombs that could be dropped automatically, wars without fights, without heroes of cowards. I wonder what he would have thought about the two Hiroshima and Nagazaki bombs, one thing for sure, If Patton's state of mind didn't belong to his era, his aura could appeal to any country",10,5,6,31 May 2012
La Grande Illusion," The Way War Was ...
","We learned from 'Paths of Glory', 'All Quiet on the West Front' and any History book, what a disastrous slaughter World War I was. But the purpose of Jean Renoir's 'Grand Illusion' is less to demonstrate the hellish than the futile nature of War. Futile because usually instigated by upper classes in the name of profit, greed and imperialism (usually disguised as patriotism) while all the working-class people share the same desire to live in peace, harmony and solidarity. The tragedy of War is to make people believe in an illusory adversity while they're equal in life  and naturally, in death. This vision of war might surprise but this is Renoir's vision, it belongs to HIS generation, who grew up with a war still conducted by gentlemen, where the purpose was admittedly to defend a country but not to turn people into killing machines. Renoir, despite his military background, loathed the zealous and dehumanizing devotion to the Army, as he said in the film's commentary, the point of showing the rifle was not to learn a series of precise movements like a robot, but just to show a goddamn clean rifle. With that in mind, we understand the soldiers' cordiality in 'Grand Illusion' and the peculiar way they were treated by the enemy. And on that aspect, the context of the film couldn't have been more significant as Nazism, the ideology that annihilated so many pillars of European civilization, hadn't undermined yet Renoir's nostalgic feeling; Germans were still 'good enemies'. We can assume that a film like 'Grand Illusion' could never have been made after World War II although it's the very conflict that highlighted the film's prophetic value. Indeed, 'Grand Illusion' belongs to the Greats, it was Orson Welles' favorite movie and it has always been compared to the glorious 'Citizen Kane' in terms of impact on the field of filmmaking, as one of the first truly humanistic dramas. But as odd as it sounds, it's not to 'Citizen Kane' that I feel like comparing 'Grand Illusion' but to another masterpiece named 'Gone With the Wind'. 'Grand Illusion' is also about an Order, a 'Civilization of Chivalry and Gallantry' forever gone. It is the swan song of the Old Europe that died with World War I, and which is incarnated by two characters: Pierre Fresnay as Captain De Boeldieu captured by the Germans with Lieutenant Maréchal, and Erich Von Stroheim as the iconic Von Rauffenstein. 'De' and 'Von' are the two prefixes that define the European aristocracy and both Boeldieu and Rauffenstein realize during the lunch following the capture, that they have many acquaintances and are familiar with the same things. Maréchal, the blue-collar officer played by a young and handsome Jean Gabin, is more down to earth and engages an even friendlier exchange with a German alter ego.The lunch scene sets up the tone of the film where the relationships between French, Russian and British prisoners and the German soldiers flirt so much with a 'comedy of manners' that it puts the whole meaning of 'War' into perspective. Renoir resisted the temptation to make a conventional war film and serves us in three distinct acts, a beautiful tale of humanity and friendship. The first act is the ancestor of all the POW movies such as 'The Great Escape' or 'Stalag 17' where we'd meet a colorful gallery of French prisoners, digging a tunnel. They're well treated and sometimes eat better than their guards, thanks to Rosenthal a rich Jew, played by Marcel Dalio, who shares his goods with his fellow prisoners. Rosenthal incarnates the new wealth of France who'd ultimately be the target of the Anti-Semitism ignited by the Nazi occupation.The first act climaxes with the superb scene where a cross-gender musical number is interrupted by the announcement of the Douaumont Fort taken back by the French army, and in a patriotic outburst lead by Maréchal, the prisoners start singing 'La Marseillaise' in a powerful and stirring moment that inspired 'Casablanca'. The second act takes place in a fortress where Boeldieu and Maréchal, after a series of failing escapes, are affected. The part centers on the friendship between Rauffenstein and Boeldieu, two men aware that their world is about to collapse, regardless of their nationality. They speak English in the most intimate moments as to denote their similar cosmopolitanism, before a new generation would embrace modernity, for the better and for the worse. It's a poignant transition incarnated by the sacrifice of Boeldieu, playing with the flute, the famous 'steamboat' child song that related a sacrifice story.Boeldieu's courageous act created a diversion that allowed Maréchal and Rosenthal to escape, and after this display of humanity and a poignant deathbed farewell between the two aristocrat officers, we follow Gabin and Dalio, in their struggle to cross the Swiss border, concluding in an anticlimactic way by their journey in a German farmhouse, inhabited by Elsa (Dita Parlo), a young widow and mother. They stay a while to recover from injuries and hunger until Christmas. Elsa proved to be trustful when she saved them from the German army, an act due to the fact that she also suffered from the loss of brothers, ironically, in three German victories. Victory is such an illusion when it comes to death, but it's the very illusion of borders that would save the life of Maréchal and Rosenthal when a group of German soldiers refuse to shoot them because they are in the Swiss territory. For a war movie, 'Grand Illusion' strikes by an unusual absence of battles and fight scenes. Uniforms and brief but powerful occurrences of death remind of the historical setting but overall, 'Grand Illusion' is an atypical war film, whose atypical message is precisely what elevated it at the rank of the greatest movies ever made. And that Joseph Goebbels named it 'Enemy Public Number 1' is probably the proof of its undeniable value.",10,0,1,11 April 2012
Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind," If Miyazaki had made that film only, his legacy would have been the same...
","The name of Nausicaä belongs to Greek mythology; she was the Princess who saved Ulysses from drowning. And the 'Valley of the Winds' was loosely inspired from the tragedy of Minimata Bay and the way it maintained its ecosystem viable despite the pollution. 'Nausicaä of the Valley of the Winds' finds the perfect balance between the theme of nature always finding its way and the dramatic struggle of a heroine saving humanity from 'drowning' in belligerent wickedness.I'm mentioning Minimata but the tragedy of Fukushima could have inspired a similar intuition that technological advances could only lead to the downfall of humanity inasmuch as men continue to display the same carelessness and arrogance. In his 'Nausicaä', Hayao Miyazaki doesn't warn us but rather confronts us to a plausible future, a future with a few survivors driven to the last corners of Earth where wind and water prevented a toxic jungle name Fukaï from spreading.The film, all in visual splendor, displays the usual Sci-fi and Fantasy archetypes but they don't distract from the environmentalist and pacifist message. We accept them in the sense that the story is set one thousand years after the apocalypse and we expect technology to have produced jet-propelled gliders and flying vessels. But the film also has a Renaissance look à la 'Princess Mononoke', it's not an artistic license, the privileged people of the Valley represent a wiser side of humanity that got back to the roots, acknowledging the eminence of nature, a renaissance indeed.They live in an oasis-like area where the air is breathable, outside; they must wear a gas mask, accentuating the dystopian look even within a natural setting. The hostility of nature is symbolized by giant mutant insects and the Ohm, armored trilobite-like insects whose eyes turn to an ominous red whenever they feel threatened. But Miyazaki never lets us get the wrong idea about these Ohm, understand they're not the most life-threatening creatures out there.There's a key scene right in the beginning where a little fox-like creature bites Nausicaä, she patiently keeps her finger until its frenzy fades out and then the animal licks her wound. This moment is pivotal because it highlights the real tragedy that caused men's downfall, not violent actions but immediate assumptions of violence causing bad reactions. Only Nausicaä is capable of showing mercy and empathy toward any living creature, she challenges all the common conceptions and even tries to understand the place she lives in, which is the epitome of wisdom.From the spores taken during regular expedition, she discovers in her laboratory that plants are capable of producing air, later in the film that some jungle plants purify the polluted topsoil and produce clean water. In other words, life always finds a way but humans can't see it. Nausicaä becomes the messianic character that will open the eyes of humanity, and as truth can be stranger than fiction, she's also a pivotal moment in Miyazaki's career, as the first film to have emerged from the fertile soil of his own imagination.Nausicaä foreshadows all the elements that will define his work: the independent free-spirited heroine, the aerial settings and the environmental and anti-war messages, and more than that, the revolutionary notion that you don't need villains to make a story. Everyone is imperfect and fallible, even the most violent attacks are meant as defensive moves or precautions. The film contains a lot of action, lethal explosions and battles, people die by the sword, including Nausicaä's but Miyazaki couldn't have been more pacifists, every detail says in subtext that violence isn't the answer.Indeed, how can the cause of the trouble ever be the solution? Miyazaki, a master storyteller, delivers crucial information even in the most unnoticeable moments, even the opening credits show through Roman mosaic and medieval tapestry the fate of the modern world. Seven giants launching immense fire blasts (metaphor for nuclear power?) into modern buildings, it's just as if Hiroshima was depicted like the Pompeii eruption. But what is the tragedy exactly, that history taught men a lesson or that men didn't learn it? Nausicaä is set at a time that looks like a second chance but people are still fighting for good or bad reasons, from a sword master and father-figure named Lord Yupa, a young Pejite interceptor who respects Nausicaä's actions and the Tolmekian queen who (like Lady Eboshi from 'Mononoke') is perhaps the tumultuous counterpart to Nausicaä, mutilated by the creatures, she believes in violence as the language of the force, illustrating its dangerously communicative effect, the never-ending spiral that killed the world or that might lead to a third worldwide conflict.And in the midst of nihilistic violence and desolation, Nausicca emerges as a beautifully inspirational heroine. There's a hypnotic flashback (with a so-catchy playful tone) where Nausicaä's father kills a baby Ohm, on the basis that human and insects can't live together. The whole conviction of Nausicaä is that every creature has its place on Earth; it's not just about empathy but the unshakable faith on Nature's equilibrium. It is very significant that the most beautiful images from the film, all in golden yellow, are provided by the Ohm's tentacles, weren't they supposed to be the ugly monsters? Yet, at the time of its release, the film was badly edited for foreign audiences and lost into translation to become some Manga adventure in the air, and the Ohm were indeed hostile creatures. It's just as if Miyazaki was ahead of his time and it would take one decade and half before people would come back to their senses and realize that this isn't 'Flash Gordon'. Nausicaä is about conviction and goodness, pacifism and environmentalism deprived from any political innuendo.Miyazaki drew the original Manga so the film could be made, showcasing as much confidence as his heroine. In a way, Miyazaki was the Nausicaä of animation, a man with a vision, spirit and guts.",10,21,21,27 July 2017
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," The Epic Bore of Benjamin Button ...
","My eyes have beheld TV episodes with much richer plots concentrated in less than sixty minutes of thrills or hilarity, sometimes dramas, sometimes comedies, always entertainments. But when they had to endure David Fincher's 'The Curious Case if Benjamin Button' in the movie theater, I wished my popcorn box was a remote control so I could have the power to change the channel. Like Benjamin Button, I was doomed, forced to watch a fantasy biopic drama whose genre-bending atmosphere succeeded in elevating boredom to epic proportions. 'Benjamin Button' is the kind of films whose publicity relies on respectable arguments that turn out to be fallacious when you grasp the true content of the film. The film features Brad Pitt, who proved to make a great tandem with Fincher in the second half of the 90's. It starts with a creative concept, adapted from a short farce written by F. Scott Fitzgerald: a man whose life goes in reverse, born as an old person and getting younger as time goes by, talk about a 'wowing' concept, promising if it wasn't so scary. And the film is very long and is made like the kind of epic dramas that satisfy the tastes of the Academy members. But after watching 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' (damn, even the title is long), I found something distastefully pretentious not while watching the film, but after finishing it, as a second thought that never left me.I consciously use the word 'pretentious' because of the following dilemma: I wonder if the film overestimates our patience or underestimates our intelligence. Granted it has some qualities: the acting does justice to the believability of the story, with a honorable mention to the members of the nursing home where Button grew up, Brad Pitt takes his role seriously and does his best trying to convey the illusoriness of a life whose direction is in total opposition with all the other persons. And there is no doubt that the cinematography, photography, editing and directing, although not transcending, correctly serve their purpose to improve the awards nominations' statistics. But even the most appetizing plates can have an insipid taste, 'Button' looks, sounds and feels great but it lacks something vital when it comes to movie making: writing. Eric Roth, who won the Oscar for 'Forrest Gump', wrote the screenplay. When I learned that, another dilemma started teasing my mind: is it accidental or logical that the script here didn't work?I vote for logical. As original as the plot is, it needed a less ambitious format, yet Fincher stretches it for three endless hours starting the story from a deathbed flashback set right before the Hurricane Erika events, just to put the story in a chronological map and trace a clever parallel between Benjamin Button's life and history. It worked for 'Forrest Gump', because he was a fitting character for that kind of narrative while Button's condition is a story in itself and can never distract from whatever happens in his life. Roth tried to rewrite the typical picaresque story like 'Forrest Gump', I could also have mentioned 'Barry Lyndon' or 'Little Big Man' but in the case of Button, it quite simply doesn't work. I don't know if it could have worked anyway, maybe the film was victim of its own concept, after all: how can we possibly sense the profound effect the course of events has on us when our very conscience evolves from a sort of precocious wisdom to amnesia. Or maybe this is the key of Button's torment but since when does a handicap build empathy or cement a heroic status? The script tries to exploit Button's unique condition by framing it in a romance with a little girl who grew up to become the love of his life, Cate Blanchett as Daisy, an ambitious dancer, but Daisy is not Jenny, there was something quite unlikable in the way her ambition flirted with a sort of bitchy cockiness. Anyway, she never did it to me, although she inspired a very cleverly written sequence that seemed to belong to another film, if only half of 'Button' shared this quality. But no, the rest of the film was a bunch of redundancies enrobed with boring existential torments stretched like a chewing gum until it loses its taste. While it could have been adapted in an entertaining way, the film is just an assemblage of many little episodes deprived from emotions and scream for Oscar nominations  did I use the word 'pretentious'? I couldn't escape from the uncomfortable feeling that 'Benjamin Button' was just a wannabe Forrest Gump, that recycled many plot clichés that would have been unnoticed if the movie found the time to be entertaining, instead of filling it with pointless gimmicks and situations that don't go anywhere, damn even the encounter with the father who abandoned him left me cold, when I expected an emotional Himalaya, I got a hill. No seriously, 'Benjamin Button' could have been subtitled 'How to Make Best Picture nominees for Dummies', in terms of casting, of story, of writing, of cinematography, of editing, everything is handled with a remarkable marketed precision, but at the end, all you have is an empty creation whose emotional core again required less than one hour and half to grab the interest, 'Memento' or 'Groundhog Day', movies based on similar concepts, had the common decency to be short. And the film features probably the most badly written concluding lines in recent history, with the whole 'Some people do this and some people do that' when it finished with the sight of Blanchett dancing and the monologue ended with ' and some people just dance.' I was like 'give me a break', if that is the punch line of the whole thing, it means that just because we watched characters talking and acting during three hours, Fincher took our empathy for granted, and that also is pretentious.",4,4,7,6 February 2012
Men in Black II," 'Meh' in Black...
","I just watched 'Princess Mononoke' this weekend. What's that got to do with 'Men in Black II'? Nothing, these movies don't play in the same league and shouldn't even be mentioned in the same sentence. But they have one thing in common: they both feature mysterious and fearsome creatures and the enjoyment of these two films is somewhat dependent on how believable they look. 'MIIB' might be Sci-fi comedy but the Sci-fi label implies a minimum of suspension of disbelief. It's better to laugh at something that you took seriously in the first place.Well, 'MIIB' is a real step backward when compared to the original 1997 movie but there's never a single moment in the film where nothing didn't look like a CGI abomination, I don't think they even tried to make it believable. Tentacles are recurring physical assets when it comes to the bad aliens; but in the film, they look like what an intern in George Lucas Studios would have produced before being kicked out. Watching the tentacles on that God-boar demon in the opening of 'Mononoke' was like admiring a Rembrandt painting in comparison. But I wouldn't have cared much about the special effects if the film still had 'the' special effect, the 'secret element' that whispers to your mind 'who cares? Just enjoy the goddamn thing'. Here again, the film never tries to get off the shadow of the 1997 hit, there's not a single part of the story that doesn't rely on what happens in the first, but a good sequel is a movie you can enjoy without seeing the first, one that would work as a great film in its own right. No chance with this one, to get the references, you need to see the first, if you enjoy the first, you won't love the second, you won't prefer it anyway. So, I'm asking: what's the point of making a sequel if you're not even embracing the possibility that it can be more popular than the first? If improving isn't part of the challenge, why bother? Actually, the plot (or lack of) shows how much determined they were to surpass the original.The set-up involves another Earth-destruction menace, due to a sort of mysterious star or light a shape-changing Alien must get. The alien takes the form of a Victoria's Secret model and is played by Lara Flynn Boyle, the only gag that could have resulted from her sexiness is used in the start. After that, she's just a sexy villain (not very convincing though) and the two-headed sidekick played by Johnny Knoxville, plays the Vincent d'Onofrio part, but there's no gag that will feel original. The character of Stereo from 'Space Goofs' was far more innovative.How about Kay and Jay, the plot uses a few contrivances that makes the come-back of Jay necessary. Naturally, we learn that there's something called a deneuralyzer and good old Jeebs (Tony Shalhoub) is the one who can provide the service, two birds with the same stone, we'll get the head-splattering gag as an extra. That's what 'MIIB' does, as if it followed the lazy section of 'Sequel for Dummies', they use the same tricks with a few variations. Of course, some parts are funny, of course, there's an element of enjoyment in watching good old Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones playing with the big guns again, to see Rip Torn, the worm guys and even Michael Jackson's cameo but the heart isn't in it, and speaking of hart, even the romantic subplot with Rosario Dawson felt forced and dull.I read that they had to rework the climax because of the World Trade Center attacks, which reminded me of a film that suffered from the same issue: 'Die Hard 3' which had to end on a weak and predictable shootout because the original sequence involved a building explosion, and it was after the Oklahoma bombing. At least, the rest of the film was good, that 'MIIB' couldn't even have a mind-blowing climax makes the whole experience inferior to the first on every level.The only gag that works is the locker one, if the rest was half as good, the film would have been a good sequel, but about 'MIIB', one could paraphrase the famous quote from the 1997 film and see that its merit is to make the original look good.",6,1,2,26 June 2017
Hidden Figures," The Right Stuff... but not the 'right' color...
","'I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.' The power of Dr. King's call for equity lies in that simple word: content. Think about it, content is all what makes us equal: blood, heart, feelings and in the case of 'Hidden Figures': mathematical intelligence.It is very fascinating that the words of Dr. King could find their most powerful resonance earlier than the iconic speech, in 1961, when space was the setting of a two-man race with America as the second. The Mercury program, immortalized by one of the 80's greatest movies 'The Right Stuff', needed brains to expunge the Sputnik affront and allow the seven astronauts (Glenn, Grissom Shepard and all.) to replicate the exploits of Gagarin and beat the Russians in the ultimate challenge: the moon.By translating the confrontation between America and the Soviet Union to its vast, unexplored and neutral area, space cooled down the war. But it's nonetheless out of the Red Scare and the intolerable implications of these devilish satellites, 'sleeping by the light of a Communist moon' and such, that the US government spent billions of dollars in the program. America needed to counterattack and quick... no bucks, no 'Buck Rogers', but you didn't get these Buck Rogers without brains either.So you have two situations remarkably juxtaposed: a Space Task Group, directed by Al Harrison (Kevin Costner) pressured to get men in space asap and a Black community fighting for their right to be judged for their competences. Among their most brilliant minds, three women: Dorothy Vaughan, an informal supervisor, Mary Jackson, an aspiring engineer and Katherine G. Johnson, a mathematician, they work in the segregated Computers Division area of a Research Center attached to the NASA. Like Dr. King, they have dreams, collective and individual, and they sure got the 'right stuff' to fulfill them, but maybe not the right color of skin.These three pioneers are in the poster and they're played by Taraji P. Henson (Johnson), Octavia Spencer (Vaughan) and Janelle Monàe (Jackson); the presence of Octavia Spencer, the fact that she got her second Oscar-nomination for her role, and the great chemistry within the trio will exude inevitable 'The Help' vibes. The kinship with the previous 2011 Best Picture nominee also relies on the intertwining stories of women triumphing over segregation by remaining true to themselves. And last but not least, 'Hidden Figures' also features a 'bathroom' episode which, beyond a light comedic effect, exposes some of the most infuriating aspect of discrimination... and racism.But 'Hidden Figures' is more than 'The Help' with glasses (a comparison that made me chuckle), the film retells the main story of 'The Right Stuff' with a different focus: the pivotal contribution of African-American women for the NASA space program, its most memorable scene features thirty women being transferred to the Programming Department, assigned to work on the new IBM machine and walking like in a civil right march, but not without making a clever nod to the iconic slow-motion astronaut-walking moment in 'The Right Stuff'. Adapted from Margot Lee Shetterly's novel, I would say about 'Hidden Figures' what I said for 'Hacksaw Ridge', the greatest merit is to have brought to the big screen a great story for 2016... and a great film.Yes, I can say I enjoyed every bit of Theodore Melfi's film, it's smartness (one of the year's finest screenplays) and its capability to vulgarize complex math problems, its humor (the three actresses are equally witty and fun to watch), its sweetness and I will say its unpredictability. Indeed, when I expected many scenes to pull a 'Butler' and get too heavy with the racial material, the film surprised me by showing some genuine moments of sweetness and understanding. I particularly enjoyed the way Mary's husband supported her decision to attend night classes to pursue her dreams of becoming an engineer. For dramatization's sake, they could have injected a conflict to make things harder but the restrained and light-hearted tone was right for the film.And we can see the three women go through their parallel paths, Dorothy Vaughan's ambition to become the supervisor, constantly rejected by her own supervisor Vivian, played by an icy and effective Kirsten Dunst, and we see their relationship warm up with time and gaining more respect and consideration. In a marvelously written speech, Janelle Monàe must convince a judge to let her attend courses in an all-white school, she pleads her case with a catching passion, using the space program as an argument that nothing is impossible, and there's an obvious parallel between the space dreams of America and the dreams of the black community, things seemingly difficult but not impossible, because it is the essence of America to help people achieving them.And there's the core of the film: Katherine, assigned to assist Mr. Harrison and confronted to a manly and white office place without any bathroom, where she can't share coffee, assist meetings or sign her own reports. Everyone who worked in an office knows exactly what Katherine went through and knew at least one petty supervisor like Paul Stafford (Jim Parsons) and it's one of the emotional reward of the film to see her skills and talent finally pay off, earning her the respect of her colleagues, who'd see the content before the container.'Hidden Figures' is not just about women and segregation; it's about work, patience and intelligence and what it takes to fulfill one's ambition whether on a personal or a collective level. It might get a bit conventional here and there and as many users pointed out, the lack of smoking deprived it from a small touch of authenticity, but this is a flaw of 'epsilon' level... sorry I had to end with a math reference.",8,4,12,6 February 2017
Coco," Is family a dream-killer or quite the opposite?
","As the father of a little girl, I shouldn't mind that the world of animation became a platform designed to preach 'girl power'... but channeling my inner child, I was waiting for one Disney movie to be about a boy... it's silly I know, but maturity isn't kids' strongest suit. So I had an instant liking on 'Coco'... and the boy inside cheered, little did I know that the adult outside would weep. Damn great films, just when you think you've seen them all, there comes a little gem of imagination that catches you off guard and grab you by the heart and plunge you in a universe that look magnificent on screen yet the magnificence is nothing compared to the inner beauty of the story. 'Coco' starts with your 'typical' Disney family, but you've got to love how atypical they are from Disney standards, yet typical in an archetypical way. The Riveras, four generations of proud shoemakers and perhaps the only Mexican people to have banished music from their life... because the previous matriarch of the family was abandoned by her husband to pursue his career as a singer (the backstory-sequence is colorfully rendered in the beginning). The singer died, Music became a taboo and a golden rule was to never mention his name, ever. His last connection with the world of the living is Mama Coco, the great-grandmother of Miguel. Miguel is also your 'typical' rebellious kid, his dream is to become a musician, he loves music and his idol is the great Ernesto de la Cruz, a crooner-idol who died too soon in a freak accident. 'Seize your moment' is the legend's motto, a hymn to every dreamer who wants to be a doer. And even if the phrasing conveys some opportunistic undertones, we want to embrace it, because well, isn't that the most valuable lesson to teach kids? (especially when you have every member of a family leagued against a child, wasting his talent).But this isn't exactly what the writers of 'Coco' had in mind... sure, the Riveiras strike as quite annoying dream-killers, sure, music is important but it's less an end than a mean, a mean to reconcile the present with the past, to resurrect memories that have been buried in a ground of misunderstanding and bitterness. The magic of 'Coco' is to translate matters of life, family and death into fantasy elements and dazzling visuals, just like 'Inside Out' did with life and family period. 'Don't forget me, I'll always be there' says a dying character while pointing his index on his beloved one's heart, it's a common cliché but it's the only relief one could take with him to the 'long road'. And 'Coco' turns it into a simple but heartbreaking song, 'Remember me' and it says a lot about our deepest needs in lif... whether you believe in it or not, after watching 'Coco', you just want to believe in an afterlife that allows to live as long as you're being remembered... aren't we all in the same boat after all?Maybe not. Maybe fame is the ultimate the antidote against oblivion. Maybe that's why many people dream of posterity... yet 'Coco' doesn't say that posterity doesn't matter, it just says that it doesn't matter the way you think it does. And it simply gives a meaning to the idea of being part of a family in case some of us have forgotten. We don't choose our families, but they're part of our DNA, it's there from the start and no matter how far we go, we can never forget where we started especially when we want to move forward. Remember Mufasa's words to Simba about forgetting himself.Miguel sees his future in music, and his journey takes him to the Land of the Dead, where dead people are much alive, hanging on the memories of their families and their celebration during the 'Day of the Dead', the only occasion for them to visit the real world in a night where their pictures are surrounded with personal items, candles and flower petals. Ever since Disney's seminal 'Dance of Skeletons', there seems to be a mix of fascination and revulsion with the world of the dead Disney. But it's only fitting that a universe that killed so many characters could provide us a light of hope and allow the dead to show up once in a while like in 'The Lion King'.Maybe it's a clever way to tell kids that death isn't final, the real death one when we're forgotten, maybe the reasons humans live long enough to see their grandchildren grow is to being remembered for a much longer time. The adventure in the world of the Dead with Hector, all the dead Riveras and de la Cruz is an adventure like only Disney animators at the top of their game can provide, but the film reminded me of many other life-changing classics that made me think.'It's a Wonderful Life' made me wish more people could forgive themselves for so-called failures, 'Back to the Future' warned me that a simple choice can lead to failure and there was no coming back. 'Coco' filled my mind with similar thoughts, so many people die without coming to terms, living apart while they have so much to share and so many grandchildren don't realize what a blessing having grandparents still alive because we're blinded by ego or by dreams. This is how the film spoke to me, we all wish to accomplish big things but sometimes, instead of seizing the moments, we make the 'wise' choice... in a world that cherishes dreamers, starting with Disney... so we spend our life blaming ourselves for these choices. 'Coco' made me feel like Dorothy ended up saying 'There's no place like home', the film moved me and made me feel a little better with my choices... and that was something I didn't see co-coming.",10,0,1,11 June 2018
Lincoln," The Legacy of Honest Abe ...
","When I learned that Spielberg, the greatest director of his generation, made a biopic of Lincoln, the greatest American President, played by Day-Lewis, the greatest actor of his generation, I could bet my house, my car and all my DVD collection that the film would swap as many Oscar nominations as Razzies for the last Adam Sandler movie. If anything, the film screamed to the Academy: 'Give me the Best Picture Oscar!'But don't pay attention too much on this sarcastic tone, it's only meant to emphasize my pleasant surprise after having finished 'Lincoln'. And by 'surprise', I don't mean I didn't expect a great film, but perhaps I was mislead by the title and thought it would be an epic chronicle of the life and death of the legendary President. Actually, the film focuses on the year after his second re-election and his three-month struggle to obtain the vote of the Thirteen Amendment, which would abolish slavery before the end of the Civil War. Like John Ford's 'Young Mr Lincoln', the film spans a period of time, but probably the most significant of Lincoln's life, the one that cemented his status as one of America's greatest President, the most historically significant after George Washington.And it's precisely because the narrative is concentrated on the last four months of Abraham Lincoln, that we're able to measure with a higher extent, beyond the profound humanism, the remarkable intelligence of a man, who understood that timing mattered more than motives. Now, I expected the good man, the noble-hearted, the visionary and ahead of his time Lincoln, and I was certain Daniel Day-Lewis would be so resembling the man to the most subtle details, on that level, the lighting, the photography did one hell of a job by always keeping a shadow of mystery on Lincoln's face, exhausted, sculpted like a marble bust, in such a towering body that it looks like floating in the own light of its humanity. You forget it's Daniel Day-Lewis but truly a myth in march. Never since Ben Kingsley as Gandhi, has an actor transcended the legend of his own character, allowing him to resurrect on the silver screen with never looking like a movie character; Oscar-worthy performance? That goes without saying.Still, THAT, I expected. And Spielberg being a director who loves to touch the heart of viewers, it wouldn't have been difficult to do it, with a character such as Abraham Lincoln. But the genius of the film, where it caught me totally off-guard is to show me a new facet of Lincoln's personality: a political tactician and a genius on that level. Since John Ford's 1939 biopic, I knew Lincoln was a man of modest education but great humanism, he believed in people's goodness rather than placid codes and writings, and his experience as a lawyer forged his capability to be fair, honest and wise in his judgment. And one thing he knew was that Slavery was unfair, inhuman, unjust and had to be abolished, that was his intimate conviction, his mind wouldn't be at ease until he got the abolition.And what the film demonstrates is a brilliant display of Machiavellism for the good cause, in a sort of political chess-game whose mastermind is Honest Abe. The dilemma is quite easy to grab, Lincoln freed slaves during the Civil War but a precocious Peace wouldn't have been without collateral damages. By reintroducing the Confederate states to the Congress and give them enough weight to vote a massive 'no'. Lincoln must act and quickly, no one like him wants the peace, but if the peace threatens his project, goddammit, peace would wait. The delight of the film relies on the whole tactical choices, postponing, bribing lame duck Democrats, even using some 'lawyer's dodge' to make history, and how delightfully ironic it is that Lincoln's greatest accomplishment was achieved through corruption.The film doesn't feature many battles, there are lost of closed scenes and some intimate moments between Lincoln and his wife Molly, played by Sally Field, but the core of the film is the political conflict between Lincoln, the Republicans and the Democrats, in order to get his vote, pinnacling in the climactic vote during which many Congressmen realized they were 'making' history, and were like graced by the greatness of the project. Tommy Lee Jones steals the show with his performance as William Stevens, the most extreme abolitionist of all, a mysterious character who'd have probably sunk into oblivion without Spielberg's masterpiece. Well, you read it, I used the word 'masterpiece'  I've been very critical toward Spielberg, but it allows me to remain impartial and call a masterpiece when I see one. Like some of Spielberg's best, 'Lincoln' doesn't feature any of his archetypes: Spielberg has always been talented to push the right emotional buttons, and he could have easily fallen in that trap while handling the 'most beloved' of all the Presidents, the purest American heart. But never sentimental, 'Lincoln' is instead a gripping and intelligently written film, with powerful performances and a very un-Spielberg like austere directing painting a new portrait of the political arena, more confined and claustrophobic à la Capra , except that this time corruption is for the good cause.And when Lincoln explains in details why the slavery must be abolished, instantly, he has the aura of a prophet, of someone who knew he was meant to be President for a reason, and that's the material great men are made on. After the vote, he walks away to the theater while his servant looks at him with admiration. His job on Earth was finished and after his assassination, he belonged to time, and I suspect he became an immediate legend. Maybe the film didn't need the assassination part (despite a clever twist) as the silhouette of Lincoln walking away was already a powerful symbol, echoing the ending of John Ford's classic.",10,1,5,9 February 2013
Rules of Engagement," Cinematic Crime Against Humanity
","Woody Allen said that after listening to Wagner, he always felt an urge to invade Poland. There was a line of truth behind that joke, one that echoes the opinion of many Holocaust survivors. Not that I put the same experience on the same level, Wagnerian music can be appreciated regardless of any historical contextualization, I think that watching a movie like 'Rules of Engagement' will inspire a similar urge to go shoot some Arab civilians or kick them out of the country or just call them by the names they (supposedly) deserve.Obviously, there are two ways to look at this film. If you're an Arab, you're probably going to join that angry crowd and call it 'one of the most racist films against Arabs Hollywood ever made'. If you're not an Arab, you might consider it a flawed but not uninteresting military trial movie questioning the methods of the US Marines Corps, with an interesting friendship between two Vietnam veterans played by Samuel L. Jackson and Tommy Lee Jones. Well, it would have been interesting if the Marines were really being unethical, but then the Marines Corp. would never have permitted it. It was 'A few Good Men' again.Which leads to the premise of the film, the whole trial revolves around the fact that the man charged to evacuate the US Embassy in Yemen deliberately killed 83 civilians, even using the word with M and F so cherished by Jackson, to call the people. At that point, the film had already crossed the line, because I can't recall any other instance that made a villain out of people, children and women included. I guess it could only be done for Arabs and/or Muslims. And then the McGuffin of the film, the piece of evidence is a missing tape that will prove that the civilians were armed, again, even the children.Sure, the film isn't anti-Arab, it is anti-Extremist, no kidding. As soon as the kids carried guns, they were a threat, they were killers and they 'deserved' to be killed. That's not the element I blame on the script, what I condemn is the idea that such a story had any particular relevance, that there was a need to find a case to justify a mass-killing of civilians. To make a movie where Samuel L. Jackson the most popular US actor, defended by Tommy Lee Jones, who's not hated either, would take crap from everybody because he ordered to kill women and children, so that the emotional 'Gotcha' of the film, would be the proof that the hero was right, after all. What a relief! American honor is safe, it was the Arabs all along.Some say the film was prophetic, anticipating 9-11, how is that exactly? Did women and children pilot these planes? 9/11 was the result of a context starting with Muslims being ruled and killed by Barbarian regimes, and the military interventions didn't make things easier. But people have an inclination to accept Arabs and Muslims as fully barbarians and irremediably bad guys. I'm not saying that's the intent of William Friedkin, but what was he thinking? He's brandishing the authorization he got from the King of Morocco to shoot the film, not to mention that many extras were Moroccans, so they were part of it, it's not the Asian-looking guys passing for Libyans in 'Back to the Future'.But, as a Moroccan, I don't give much credit to Friedkin's defense, my country was the scenery of many movies that weren't exactly Arab-friendly, I even saw the shooting of some 'Homeland' scenes in my neighborhood, and I was surprised to see that the place I grew up with could pass as Iran. But in the long history of Arab and Muslim shaming, this film is probably the culmination. I have seen it many years ago, I have loose memories, but I'll never forget the ending and the infuriating effect it had. It was the only instance of a movie that made an aggressive statement against a population, and not having a single redeeming character, it was American Marines vs. Arab Civilians.In 1993, people wept with the little girl from 'Schindler's List', she was the living incarnation of the tragedy lived by the Jews. Arabs deserve reverse symbols, the one little girl who's seen dying in the film carried a weapon, I'm a father of a little girl and I don't want to venture into an analysis that would lead me to the conclusion that one deserved to die, but the film wants me to do so. As for the prophetic argument, those who claim that the film somewhat anticipated 9/11, well, how about an even that happened the very year of the release. Let me refresh your memory.In 2000, a Palestinian kid died under the arms of his fathers who was begging everybody to stop shooting. It was proved that an Israeli soldier did it, and I'm sure it was an accident, but even that kid's death met with denial. Supporters of Israel said it was a set-up, he was killed by one of their own, I even remember a French actor saying that he read the father was ready to sacrifice another son, no one questioned the veracity of this information. Now, there was a kid, he wasn't armed, and he was killed but no one made a symbol out of him, outside the Arab world, it's like the Western audiences would rather have fictional Arab villains than genuine victims, and that's the core of the problem.Same shtick, when Muslims die in a bombing, it's because they wanted to, when their kids die, it's because they were used as shields. There's already a strong anti-Arab resentment and movies like 'Rules of Engagement' make it worse. it will teach them to always be careful about Arabs, even women, even little girls, who knows? They might hide grenades inside their dolls.",1,4,8,14 June 2017
Pi," A disturbing series of levels of metaphysical greatness tending to perfection ...
","IRRationality.And complexity.THIS is Pi.This is the number Pi.AND THis also applies to the movie 'Pi'.A MASTERPIece moving the vision of the world to extraordinary levels of abstraction.GAlileo once said Mathematics was the language with which God has written the universe. Is this a hypothesis or a statement? IN FACT, a fundamental assumption, in the tormented mind of the math genius Max Cohen, no doubt that the mysteries of life and universe are all governed by the perfect harmony of mathematical patterns.AND THis perfection inhabiting the mathematical universe is Max's Holy Grail, the key of the ultimate knowledge, the eradication of this torturing and tormenting pain illustrated by a dizzying fast-paced editing, oscillating between harmonic and logical movements and the constant anguish of a man, trapped in his superior cerebral condition, a blessing and a doom.BUT the grainy, shaky, black and white cinematography with that high contrast, conveys in an extremely efficient way the nightmarish aspect of this quest for mathematical perfection. 'Pi' carries the roots, square and weird, of what will constitute the thematic core of Darren Aronofsky's films: physical sufferance, passion that tends to addiction, and addiction as an increasing series of terms that converges to alienation, and in the most extreme cases : death. Life is a convergent sequence with a mortal limit, our painful limitation. The key rhymes with infinity.INFINity is whatever transcends our human condition, as an entity not defined by the normal rules but something higher, more abstract, unreachable, God-like  the ideal entity that doesn't obey to quantitative rules, whether it's infinite or infinitesimal, the true essence of mathematics. Only an infinite language could have written a universe distinctive by its infinity, Galileo was right, and what Max wants to define is the law that governs the universe, infinity can be defined if not be reached, and there must a pattern that defines the language God wanted to use, that knows the verity about God, His secret  Max's quest transcends the mathematical world to a greater metaphysical level. Is Max Cohen the chosen one among the chosen people? The messenger of God with constant harassment as spiritual persecution? Is he 'Mad Max'? Or 'The Man who Knew Too Much'? THE PARANoid feeling grows with the sentiment that Max is getting closer to the truth, the universal truth about the supreme mathematical pattern, the Goddess  the one that regulates the ratings in Wall Street or the perfect natural harmonies, the one that kills off the very notion of hazard. There is no hazard, everything is under the control of a perfect and omnipresent law, the perfect law. The perfect law like the perfect ration incarnated by the iconic golden number, you know, that 'theta' you can find everywhere, in architecture, painting, and even in the natural aesthetics of human proportions, the golden ratio as the universal law, the universal incarnation of beauty and perfection illustrated by the golden spiral as the universal movement. The world is a perpetual movement from an infinitesimal start to infinity, whether you find in a sea shell or in the Milky Way. And the paranoia is like a visual demonstration of Max's hypothesis as the very pattern that drives the movie in a self-reflexive way, from a simple quest for knowledge, Max takes a vertiginous tour where he's followed by a big Wall Street firm, a group of Hasidic rabbis, going from a math genius, to a dangerous mind until becoming God's revelation. Max's fate goes out of proportions in a spiral that seems to go unlimited with the core is still poor Max's agonizing head  THE MOVIE Transports us into the nightmarish journey of a man whose obsessive quest for perfection highlights its own futility. Indeed, in a dirty, rotten world, made of impurity, of lies, greed, mediocrity, whatever perfection means, no one human enough to desire would deserve it, not even Max. Max is intelligent, but his intelligence is obviously limited. Take any epsilon, whatever level of intelligence Max's head can elevate itself to, you'll have one level above which the absolute value of the difference between Max's intelligence and its own limitation will be smaller than this epsilon, the drill in the end is that epsilon, and the conclusion is the limitation, eyes can't face sun nor death, said a French philosopher, Max's eyes did both. But Max is only a human and the beauty of mathematic relies sometimes in its irrationality and Max's triumph relies on the recognition of his weakness. If you ask why the movie was titled 'Pi' instead of 'theta', the golden ratio, well just think of Pi as the incarnation of the irrational number, an idea of perfection that can't be defined through a pattern. Pi is math's infinity and Max's limitation, Pi is Max's truth and the very demonstration that mathematics are superior, no matter what, and this is why, on a more personal level, I always loved mathematics as the universe that can only be defined by its own rules, a world of perfect harmony and total complexity. Remember in the beginning, I described 'Pi' as a complex film, it is indeed less in the semantic than the mathematical meaning of the word. 'Pi' contains a real and an imaginary part, like in any Aronofsky's film that portrays with a tremendous genius, the impact of our fantasies and our inner fears on our everyday lives. 'Pi' is Darren's debut predicting his iconic trademarks, where our subconscious affects our body, incapable of transcending its physical trap venting its anger on that same body responsible of so much pain, so much limitation. Mathematics are the cause and the solution of the torment, but like God, they're too perfect to be reached, you can tend to, but never touch them. I love maths, I love cinema, I could not not love Darren Aronofsky's masterpiece 'Pi'",10,1,5,24 June 2011
Children of Men," An inconveniently truthful masterpiece that'll grow in significance with time...
","Eschatological fears are pillars of religious beliefs and our time isn't the most likely to appease them. Even on a personal level, if the future could be revealed, I'm not sure there'd be many candidates for curiosity. This is why dystopian sci-fi movies are essential, they force us to face the more inconveniently truthful situations. And we seem to be on the right track for a scenario à la 'Children of Men', minus the infertility plot. I'm not too far from Calais, the terminal of thousands of refugees fleeing the Syrian War, after a long journey that started in Turkey. But England shut its frontier so that no refugee could ever reach the British Fortress, and I bet the issue weighted a lot on the Brexit vote. And Calais, ever since, become known as the 'Jungle' a lawless place, with more opportunistic than Syrian immigrants.These refugees are the pawns of a system beyond us all, the fall-outs of wars lead in the Middle East that destroyed despotic yet stable regimes like Libya, Iraq and now Syria, and whose tiny fanatic or terrorist minority might cause the wars of tomorrow. While not caged, the refugees are stacked like cattle and live in horrendous conditions but so are Calais' inhabitants and shopkeepers. And while left-wings group support the refugees in the name of humanity, right- wings groups support the population in the name of 'common sense'. Now, where would you side?The same goes in 'Children of Men', where everyone has reasons to fight as the harm is done anyway, and if the film was dystopian in 2006, one decade later, it feels disturbingly realistic. I'm of a Muslim background and there was a scene where Muslim refugees, carrying a corpse, were marching over London, shouting 'Allah Akbar'. For some reason, I thought it was a pretty realistic portrait of the way things could evolve, and maybe I can empathize with European people who'd rather preserve their lifestyle. But they should put the blame on their former leaders and their mistakes of devastating proportions, if anything the world owe them the frontier-less mess it has become. But if 'Children of Men' was only about that 'mess' I'm not sure it would have garnered the same critical acclaim. Indeed, a dystopian film better has an interesting story to tell to cancel out the depressing stuff. And it does, 'Children of Men' starts in 2027 with the death of Baby Diego, the youngest person on Earth, age 18. Cuaron doesn't care for exposition, we get straight to the point that there's a huge epidemic of infertility and the human species is bound for extinction. We don't need to know why and how this happened. This is a magnificent example of a MacGuffin that doesn't raised more questions than needed, that the whole world but Britain is under chaos seems plausible. 'Children of Men', adapted from P.D. Jones' novel, tackles a subject that is central to Science Fiction, the survival of human specie. And now, Earth is stricken by a disease condemning humanity, it turns out to be every man for himself. One can die if he knows he lets family behind him, but that his memory won't survive to the world is something beyond acceptation, it's like dying forever, it's the deathblow on the only thing that could make men feel immortal. And with this simple premise, 'Children of Men' exposes us to our human condition, asking a simple question 'now, with all that context in mind, would you die for the only woman who can give birth to a child?'. In the film, soldiers fight for order, Fishes, a clandestine group fights for the rights of the refugees; but there are also people dying for Kee (Clare Hope-Ashitey) the only woman who miraculous survived the epidemic. Again, the MacGuffin works, we don't need to know why she's spared, there's no time for that, the mission is to allow her to deliver in safety and make her case help to find a remedy to the disease. At first, she's introduced to Theo Caron (Clive Owen) by his former girlfriend and co-activist Julian (Julianne Moore), another Fishes' member Luke (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is assigned to drive Kee and her midwife and watchdog Miriam (Pam Ferris) to the safest place but Theo has to come with them as the deliverer of letters of transit. By the time, he figures out the real motives of some members, the situation gets trickier. Theo (Clive Owen) starts as the cynical every-man, with an office work and a pot-smoking friend played by a scene-stealing Michael Caine, he thinks his life is meaningless but then he understands that it doesn't amount to a hill of beans to the more meaningful life of Kee and her baby to born. Kee is the resurrection of hope, fittingly a woman of African descent as to remind us where we come from, and the first source of genuine smiles and laughs in a film that is rather bleak and depressing, but how would you expect a children-less world to be? In a way, the infertility cure might be the metaphor for the way we're compromising our future through our actions.Although I'm tempted to get philosophical, I'd like to end the review in a more simplistic term; 'Children of Men' is a great film in the Howard Hawks' meaning of the word: three good scenes and no bad scenes. There are absolutely no bad scene and they're three amazingly single-shot action sequences (all in long takes) in the opening, the middle and naturally the climax of the film, who uses the crowd in a documentary-like realism that immediately made me think of 'Battle of Algiers', released 40 years earlier.I wouldn't be surprised if Cuaron's masterpiece reached a similar status in 2046 and maybe less surprised if the world looked like 2027 as the film gains in significance as time goes by.",10,1,3,23 September 2016
Million Dollar Baby," Emotional Knock-Out ...
","'Million Dollar Baby' is undoubtedly the most acclaimed movie of 2004. It has often been referred by movie critics as a cinematic come-back to a more traditional film-making, like the dark and gripping Hollywood underdog stories of the 30's and 40's, a comparison that has been made for 'Rocky' in its time.'Million Dollar Baby' is a film of a few characters that yet constitute a solid and powerful acting ensemble. But has Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman ever gave a disappointing performance? Even Hillary Swank who won the Oscar for Best Actress, is totally diluted in her role as Maggie Fitzgerald, the white trash Southern girl whose only dream in life is to become a professional boxer. 'Dream' is too vague a word, 'reason to keep faith in this world' is more appropriate. And faith is a redundant theme in the story, faith as a strong belief in life's driving forces, including ours. It's definitely an underdog story, but told with great respect to the viewers.Like its glorious 'underdog' predecessor, 'Rocky', 'Million Dollar Baby' restrains all the emotions until finally imploding during a poignant and heart-breaking third act. The first ones consist on building relationships until their reason-to-exist within the story emotionally bloom. Clint Eastwood is Frankie Dunn, the hardened boxing trainer and Morgan Freeman, his assistant Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris, an ex-athlete whose dead eye symbolize other unconcealed wounds in his heart. Frankie also has demons to exorcise, and the film never tries to hide them. We understand it's about a daughter life has taken away from him, that he tries to find some meaning about God, harassing a priest with pointless questions ... that would take all their significance at the end.It's also easy to see that Maggie would complete Frankie, that he's going to help her as much as she will. It takes time before he takes the crucial decision to train her, maybe too much time but this is the mark of a film that cares more about characters than action. It's true sometimes, we can feel some events coming, when Frankie seems reluctant to engage his most valued protégé in Heavyweight championship; we know it's a matter of time before the man leaves him. Why? Because there has to be a gap in Frankie's heart, and relationships are all about 'filling gaps'. That's what Balboa said about his romance with Adrian, the same goes between Frankie and Maggie, in a father-and-daughter way. There is a mystery surrounding the Gaelic nickname he'll gave to her, the translation, if not surprising, is nonetheless poignant.That's the point, if you expect surprises, if you expect twists and new artistic licenses on the Sports genre, get ready for disappointment. 'Million Dollar Baby' has the one flaw of Clint Eastwood's film: things are obvious and straight-forward, the bad guys are bad, the good ones are good. The way Maggie is treated by her opportunistic Welfare-cheating family, almost as villainous as the Big Blue Bear, is Eastwood's trademark, the depiction of a world in black and white. The film itself has a dark and shadowy atmosphere, conveying the nastiness and cruelty of a world, where the most precious moments have to keep intimate and secret. Rather than an exercise in obviousness, 'Million Dollar Baby' is a film that focuses on these intimate interactions, these moments where something sacred is transmitted: a secret, a declaration, a revelation  And only Eastwood and Freeman can get away with their own clichés without ruining the film's intents. Yes, we have Morgan Freeman and his noble voice-over narration, translating into words what sometimes images can't express. Yes his gravely, deliberately monotonous voice, has a hypnotizing effect in our ears. Yes, Eastwood is groaning, grumpy character. Yes, the comparison with 'The Shawshank Redemption' is inevitable, and it's impossible not to laugh sometimes at Eastwood's bad moods. But 'Million Dollar Baby' has to be judged in its entirety, if you feel manipulated, ask yourself about the movie's pay-off, what does it speak to you? What does it say about life, about dreams? Sentimentality is one thing, but movie-making is an art-form whose merit can only be judged on its capacity to inspire emotions. And emotionally, the ending is satisfying.I feel like I would spoil the film if I go further in this review. I don't want to reveal the events that constitute the final third act, although the film's ranking among one of the greatest tear-jerker give enough hints not to expect a happy ending. But again, it's not about happiness, but about people meeting each other, and filling each other's gaps. It flirts with some obviousness, but to be sincere, I never felt it forced or stereotypical. I wish I could be smart and cynical enough to dismiss the film, and label it as propaganda, manipulation and dangerous influence, but the fact is that the three performance touched my heart. I understand the criticism, I even understand the hatred, but the film deeply moved me.The 'obviousness' is precisely what critics refer as renaissance of Hollywood tradition. Maybe in this era where psychological thrillers and non-linear narrative are overused by new talents, a movie like 'Million Dollar Baby' that doesn't care about subtlety and nuance yet cares to tell a gripping and powerful story about three people, maybe this is the refreshment cinema asked for. And the fluid directing, the shadowy cinematography, the patient editing and the acting, contribute to a powerful movie, showing people evolving with time, people with dreams and hopes.Reviewing a film is a matter of genuine feelings and sincerity; I would be lying to myself if I started to criticize it for the sake of it. If I did, no matter how clever and hip I would sound, I wouldn't dare to review other movies. In all sincerity, I loved 'Million Dollar Baby' and it's indeed one of Clint Eastwood's best works.",9,2,4,30 April 2013
Donnie Brasco," A poignant and insightful character study ... carried by two masterful performances from Johnny Depp and Al Pacino ...
","Whatever 'Donnie Brasco' achieves is all the more impressive because it was made in 1997, after the successes of 'Goodfellas' and 'Pulp Fiction' and much more, the film was directed by an outsider: the English Mike Newell who did 'Four Weddings and a Funeral'. But when you watch 'Donnie Brasco', these considerations never matter because there's much more to appreciate than the typical gangster material, and we know that the best gangster movies were impacting because crime only provided the necessary setting to highlight much more fascinating human dilemmas. Family in 'The Godfather', friendship in 'Once Upon a Time in America', the gangster world is like the best amoral standard to underline some moral or redeeming qualities. 'Donnie Brasco' is based on the true story of an undercover FBI agent named Joe Piscone who infiltrated the Mafia in the late 70's and who ultimately contributed to no less than 100 arrests, a real earthquake in gangster-land, and that there is still a price put on his head says a lot about his 'legacy', and about his talent. Infiltrated as 'Donnie Brasco', Joe went so deep in the Mafia he was at two inches of becoming a made-guy, he was a living irony as a precious man for both cops and criminals. And that's part of the excitement when you follow 'Donnie Brasco': it invites us to watch Johnny Depp playing two roles within a role, he's Joe Pistone with the FBI and with his wife, remarkably played by Anne Heche, and within his gang, he's Donnie aka Don the Jeweler. On that double-identity level, Depp demonstrates his tremendous acting abilities as the titular character. Indeed, when you look at Depp's portrayal of Brasco, his facial expressions are dark and immobile, as if he was posing for a photograph. He's literally putting a mask that never leaves his face, that's not a detail because each of his expressions and looks are calculated. He knows that any hesitation or unnatural act would sign his death warrant, so he must focus on his performance, that's method acting at its extreme. Depp embodies the pressure constantly endured by Donnie in a virtuoso performance that possibly got unnoticed because it didn't show a wide range of emotions, but it must take a superhuman acting strength to play such a restrictive roles with conviction. Depp succeed in what Di Caprio generally fails in my opinion: looking tough despite a boyish look. And Depp's convincingness is not just crucial for the film, but for the whole plot, because we have to believe that he would be immediately trusted.'Donnie Brasco' never takes its 'based on true story' for granted, the process of Donnie's infiltration is believable because of Paul Attanasio's Oscar-nominated script (the writer was nominated for 'Quiz Show' three years before) and Pacino's performance as Lefty Ruggiero. The film probably closes what I believe is Pacino's gangster ark, he played the most ruthless Mafia Don, Michael Corleone, a small-time gangster who went at the top, Tony Montana, and now, he's Lefty, a hit-man with a 30-year old experience, totally disillusioned about his dreams to be at the top and drinking to forget his lousy condition. We can believe that a man like that would need a rookie, someone to make him feel important in the crime hierarchy. Lefty is poignantly sympathetic when he takes Donnie under his 'protection' and teaches him all the ropes of the business. He's a living encyclopedia when it comes to the Mafia codes, so his character does not only enrich Donnie's knowledge, but also the FBI's and ours. 'Donnie Brasco' is an informative treasure about the Mafia in the 70's, immersing us this time, in a small gang, so 'small' it kind of makes the film alternatively funny, like when they offer a lion to Lefty because he loves animals, or have fun like a bunch of kids in Florida and dramatic, the film features one of the most graphic shootouts and disposal of bodies you'll ever see, or both effects like in the ambiguous 'Japanese' restaurant scene, a moment that seems to borrow a lot from Scorsese and Tarantino. The casting is a strike of genius, Michael Madsen as the leader Sonny Black, the enemy of Sonny Red (unintentional humor) is genuinely frightening and charismatic, he lacks the boyish charm of 'Mr. Blonde' but not the violence and Bruno Kirby is a more jovial and less violence-prone version of Joe Pesci. Still, 'Donnie Brasco' is not the chronicle of a successful undercover job, but a heart-breaking friendship story between two men, Lefty and Donnie. Joe does his job and would never consider himself a rat, unless his actions turn out to be fatal to the one who answered for him. We're all humans, and the beauty of the film is that the line between Donnie becoming a hostage to his job and developing Stockholm syndrome finds the right level of ambiguity. Donnie feels he becomes one of them but sometimes, it's the only way to be alive in the eye of the hurricane. And maybe he's not becoming one of them, but he realizes that even in this criminal and amoral world, they are like anyone. Donnie demonstrates this dilemma and Lefty proves it to be right, the most haunting scene of the film and one of Pacino's finest occurs when he leaves his house, understanding what he's sent for. He leaves his stuff in a drawer, keep it opens and leaves a last message to Donnie: 'if it had to be anyone, I'm glad it was him'. At the end, he doesn't regret what he did, he still loves Donnie and that he owed him his death matters less than the nice moments they had. That's the heart of the film, and what elevates 'Donnie Brasco' among the best of the genre, and believe me, it only gets better after each viewing.",9,2,3,5 September 2012
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," When Individual Fears Don't Compromise Collective Courage... and Vice Versa...
","In the middle of the 50's, McCarthyism reached the heights of fear and terror. It appears that it is partly due to the personality of Senator McCarthy and lines of questioning that confined to bullying and intimidation at the expense of legal procedures. Being submitted to the HUAC could make you as communist as Stalin, so no one dared to criticize McCarthy for individual safety's sake. Terror and fear were the vital components of McCarthyism, a shameful time of America's history, that was close enough to repeat itself in the 2000's for that's the way history punishes those who forget their lessons.And the main lesson we can grasp from George Clooney's 'Good Night, and Good Luck' is that you can't fool everyone every time. McCarthyism crossed a few boundaries, notably when the Air Force threatened to expel a soldier if he didn't denounce his father and sister, suspected of communist inclination on the basis of revelations sealed in an envelope. So CBS 'Person to Person' host Edward Murrow (David Strathairn) felt it was time to confront the dubious methods of the Commission. This was a time where television was the new medium and Murrow was a man of no-nonsense rigid face and unflinching cigarette perfectly exuding unflappable professionalism. Strathairn gives the performance of a lifetime as a journalist who's confident, sometimes overly, but who's a pro to the core, he only consider facts and can't accept that lives would be destroyed without any substantial proof.And Murrow isn't a lone crusader for he finds support from his colleagues, his co-producer Fred Friendly (George Clooney), the CBS news executive (Jeff Daniels) and chief executive (Frank Langella). If anything, 'Good Night, and Good Luck' praises the merit of team working and the solidarity driven by decency and principles. There's a moment where (before attacking McCarthy), Friendly asks the team if any of them can be accused of Communist sympathy even in the loosest way. The conclusion of this scene says it all 'terror is right there in this room' and the scare of the moment was enough a reason to walk the walk. The paranoia is even induced by an interesting subplot involving Robert Downey Jr. and Patricia Clarkson, as two workers of very strange behavior, until we realize the purpose this subplot served: highlighting our own paranoia.George Clooney's retelling of the pivotal moment where America rebelled against McCarthy through the figure of Ed Murrow carries the mark of the 50's, it has a great black and white cinematography, a lot of smoking and the use of real footage of senator McCarthy complete the touch of authenticity. But the film is also a timely reminder of the value of good and honest information, it says a lot about the 50's but speaks volumes for the 2000's. Clooney has always been vocal about human rights and democracy. By choosing to tackle this subject, he reminded the audience that America has been through this, and September 11 instated a Green Scare that had nothing to envy from McCarthyism. And from the Patriot Act, it became clear that you had no other choice than proving loyalty to the flag or you were deemed as a traitor. But a good American beyond any reproach had the guts to destabilize McCarthy in the 50's, by doing his job.And 'Good Night, and Good Luck' with a meticulous precision shows how the job is done, the meetings, the way they all pick quotations for McCarthy and deconstruct them. Murrow criticizes the Senator but invites him to give any refutation or correction. McCarthy's defense is to accuse Murrow of Communist sympathy. I thought that was the 'dramatic' moment where Murrow would finally take a hit. No, Murrow's next statement was nothing but brilliant. Since McCarthy didn't make any reference to all the statements made, that means he found no mistake. That's the power of Murrow, he doesn't flinch and his professionalism, empowers everyone around and it's a matter of time before McCarthy gets destabilized with the infamous 'have you go no decency?', when brave people, without showing sympathy to Communism echoed this famous line of Sir Thomas More: 'I would give the devil the benefit of the Law, for my own safety'.It's not about McCarthy but Law.The downfall of McCarthy is a victory for Murrow but of bittersweet taste because the program will not be renewed, for lack of sponsors. And that might be another of the great lessons from such a short yet complex film. Like many movies about the 50's, ads play a significant part on TV, 'Quiz Show' had Geritol, here we have Kent cigarettes and Alcoa, and as a buff of TV game shows like 'What's my Line' I know that TV couldn't survive without it. So, the film rises the most important issue, one that works as a bridge between the 50's and now: if people have money to sponsors shows, if they can threaten a show to be canceled then information obviously belongs to the sponsor. It's as simple as that, and in a context of globalization, this reality gets even scarier..The movie ends with a warning, that if we take TV as just a medium for entertainment and not information, then we'll be alienated candidates for mediocrity. One can argue that Internet provided an alternative, but in a way, it also alienated us a little more and too many information are harder to control and verify so anything can be build on rumors and falsehoods. If McCarthy could use the Internet, maybe more lives might have been destroyed, he might have as well become president or someone like him.But that's a prophetic aspect of Clooney's film I don't want to venture into, it depressed me to the point I envy anyone leaving this ugly world, and if it ever happened to me, I would be tempted to tell those I love; 'good night and good luck'.",9,3,3,11 February 2017
Mulholland Drive," 'Mulholland Dr.' at the crossroad between fantasy and reality, illusion and disillusion, conventional cinema... and David Lynch!
","Last night I had the strangest dream no, I didn't sail away to China but let's just say that dream was far more exciting than the day that started when I woke up.Hitchcock said cinema was 'life without the dull bits'. In a way, dreams play like an 'internal cinema', they're emotional, haunting, 'entertaining' to some degree and naturally, they're mysterious. And their mysteries are of the toughest sort because they can only provide clues, not explanations, hints, not signals, and sometimes we just wake up and we don't even have time to reassemble the pieces of the puzzle. If there ever is a puzzle, which is even more puzzling! If films played like dreams, movie theaters would serve aspirin tablets instead of popcorn, we live in a time where what most viewers seeks is an experience with a meaning, a point, a plot or enough visual hyperbolas to hook our eyes onto. Cinema has become so ambitious on a technical level yet so simple intellectually, only challenging you when it handles timely or socially relevant themes. It does immerse you into a new world, it does ask some suspension of disbelief but let's face it, a very few directors have ever touched the 'essence' of dreams. David Lynch did and he did it magnificently in 'Mulholland Dr.', certainly his masterpiece.The film isn't a mystery: it is, quoting Lisa Simpson, herself quoting Churchill: 'a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma'. There is a narrative in the sense that it's Lynch telling us a story but no matter how hard you try to focus on the 'plot', there comes a moment where you realize it isn't just about what you think you're seeing, but the unseen these things you're watching are hinting at, it's another level of comprehension. It's not even asking for comprehension but a genuine desire to embrace the film's mood and it's so lavishly done that any movie lover would enjoy this film. It starts by trying to separate between the real, the dream and the subconscious until you discover how symbiotically they all interact on a cinematic level.
In other words, this is surrealism at its finest.For the sake of the review, I'll mention that it's about two women, a voluptuous and enigmatic brunette (Laura Harring), and a young idealistic blonde starlet (Naomi Watts). Their identities vary less misleading you than warning you over taking the 'mystery' too literally. For a mystery to be valid, it has to exist within a coherent and seemingly constant universe. If I had to compare the film with another classic, it would be 'The Wizard of Oz'. Lynch made many more explicit references in 'Wild at Heart' but in 'Mulholland Dr.', it works even better on a subtler level, characters exist within two worlds, the reality and the dream, and like in 'Oz', the way they act in reality affect their 'status' within the dream.Whose dream are we talking about? I don't feel like spoiling the experience at that point. But let's say Lynch has a unique aesthetic approach through his subtle hints, don't take their weirdness as artistic licenses, they all have a reason to exist even in a state of non-existence. And like a real guide into a dark corridor of strange visions, Lynch provides unforgettable transitions, so stylish anyone would take them as 'all flash and no substance', stuff with lampshades, phones, voices, déjà-vu situations, characters who seem totally disconnected with the story, but once you reassemble the pieces, you realize that within that strangeness, something is making sense. There is a puzzle, after all. Lynch is the Wizard of Oz, but unlike the original, you should pay attention to the man behind the (red) curtain. And it goes even deeper than that.The duplicity of characters evokes a universal reality and 'Mulholland Dr' deserves more credit for that: it shows that we don't exist on our own, on a sole layer, we are what we are, also what we wish we could be and sometimes, jealousy or envy can drive us into re-evaluating our past or reenacting it or visualizing again with a 'best case' scenario. There are two worlds intertwining, one to see through rose-tainted glasses, illusion, and a darker one, disillusion. This 'explains' the genre-bending approach: it plays like a romantic thriller, soap-opera, slapstick or horror. But Lynch doesn't treat them like genres but steps in a mind's journey, from the heights of idealization to the abysses of deception. And in-between, you've got the subconscious, and I can't think of another director that gave that abstraction a visual reality. Maybe Buñuel.Lynch is more divisive, and I don't think I enjoyed his previous movies with the same passion but 'Mulholland Dr.' comforted me that it's not his weirdness or wildness that disturbed me but how the effects played in the whole picture. 'Mulholland Dr.' had such a hypnotic beauty that I didn't mind the 'obscure' moments, I was just drawn to it, and In watched it three times in a row... and I feel like I only got the tip of the iceberg, like for 'Blue Velvet', you don't get 'Mulholland Dr.', you get it. Unfairly overlooked by the Oscars, Naomi Watts magnificently embodied two states of minds, one about the 'illusion' of Hollywood and one about the disillusion. Yes, the film has also a saying about Hollywood, the dream and what's behind.The film only received one Oscar nod, but so deserved, because this is one of the rare instances where the directing tells the story, and although the word has been hackneyed, one can see in Lynch, love him or hate him, a true auteur in the imagery, the text, the subtext and the spirit. And 'Mulholland Dr.' is a crossover between 'Memento', 'An Andalu Dog' and 'Sunset Blvd.', a surrealistic masterpiece, a Lynchian masterpiece.Now, I've said enough, from now on, it's...Silencio!",10,3,4,22 December 2017
Dumb and Dumber," I laughed a lot ... I face-palmed a lot more...
","At least the title is honest. 'Dumb and Dumber' says what it says about the film, Harry (Jeff Daniels) and Lloyd (Jim Carrey) are grown-ups with the brains of sixth graders and are so incomparably stupid that there's no need to scratch your head to determine who's supposed to be dumber. Still, I'm partial to Harry being the lesser one because unlike Carrey, Daniels adds a subtle level of likability while Carrey is channelling the obnoxiousness of his Ace Ventura and the troll-attitude of the Mask. However, that Harry seems the most sensitive doesn't say much, he didn't invent hot water either.What the title also indicates is that there's no need to look for a plot, just plug yourself in the mind of an immature teenager and let the magic of stupid laughs operate. It takes time until we're embarked in that cross-country road trip to Aspen, and their stupidity gets more tolerable. So we get the usual halts in shabby motels, gas stations, altercations with blasÃ© waitresses and hunky truck drivers, a stolen briefcase that reveals its secret at the right moment, later, we have a trip in one of Aspen's finest hotel, a dead owl, and one of the delights of the film is the way the bad guys (especially Mike Starr as Mental) believe they must be pros because no one can be that dumb.What the Farrelly brothers do is take very familiar material and use it as a clothesline to hang on it the dumbest stuff they could find. It's not much a plot than a pot where every improvisation is thrown into, an excuse for the lamest possible gag, reminding you of that kid who went as far as asking the prettiest girl in class to pull his finger and make his buddies laugh (even if it meant losing any possible chance with girls). It takes some guts to be that dumb and an extra level to base an entire movie premise on two irremediably stupid characters but that was a risk the brothers (in their film debut) were willing to take.Maybe it was a safe calculation after all, if you've got the best comedian of his generation who already proved to be bankable, how about letting him going in total control and see where it goes and if 60% of the gags must work, then throw as many gags as you can. They say quality matters more than quantity but not when you have that quantity : Harry and his mountain sheperd clad dog, Lloyd playing a lousy casanova as a limo driver, urinations on beer bottles, pranks involving mustard on burgers, fart jokes, toilet jokes, Bruce Lee imitations and so forth.There are so also many moments of gratuitous and unbearable noises that I felt like Mental being trapped between Harry and Lloyd, and started wondering who was the bad guy. These moments, as funny as they were, made me genuinely appreciate the quieter parts where they seemed to pull themselves together and stop acting like prankish children. But these moments never lasted long and I think it's fair to say that there's not one minute going in the film without at least three gags and three stupid things done, and at the very least, you get a grimace from Carrey's rubber-made face.But then again, Harry and Lloyd reach such heights of manic stupidity that I started to appreciate Jeff Daniels a little more not because I prefer him, but because Carrey is such an induspated talent who had nothing to prove after his 'Mask' and 'Ace Ventura' that it's a remarkable achievement to steal his thunder. Some of the funniest moments involve Daniels and I don't think he got the credit he deserves. And that might be the reason he tried to bring some sensitivity to the plot, as if it was the only way to compete with Carrey, being stupid in a touching way. And let's face it, the film is designed as a platform to let the machine Carrey go in total free style mode with as much imprvosation as he can afford but being touching wasn't his strongest suit, not yet, wait for 'Liar, Liar' and 'The Truman Show', for that.Indeed, it was still 1994 and Carrey's acting needed more polishing or better scripts. The problem with the 'stupid' angle is that it's so overplayed that I found myself facepalming more than laughing, chuckling more than laughing and some bits are so hilarious that other appear as totally uninspired. I wasn't too sure that Lauren Holly needed her skirt to be lifted by Jim Carrey. I'm not sure that the second appearance of Sea Bass was the Karmic comeback we expected. I'm not sure the urination gag had the best outcome. And I think the ending with the top models left me cringing more than laughing. The film relied too much on Carrey being carried away and Daniels following him that it didn't suspect that a little less could have been a little more, that a few reliefs were needed and that some of the best gags didn't involve any of the dumb and the dumber one.Ebert said he almost got hospitalized with the dead bird gag, I felt the same with the phone booth 'falcon' punch.",7,2,3,8 April 2020
Grave of the Fireflies," Profoundly real... profoundly simple... profoundly human...
","Reading Ebert's review, I was sensitive to his commentary regarding 'pillow shots' as quiet moments in the film that doesn't advance the plot, but just work as punctuating marks, little pauses so we can have a breath of off-topic humanity. Obviously, Ebert didn't grow up with Japanese anime. I did. And in the 80's and 90's animated series, many of them from the World Masterpiece Theater project, you had some peaceful moments where a character would just wash his hair or 'go to the bathroom'. It doesn't play a part to the plot, except the most essential one; making the story 'human' and seemingly devoid of narrative manipulation.This is perhaps the most significant difference between Japanese anime and the American school, aside from the painterly backgrounds and the facial shapes. And naturally, 'Grave of the Fireflies' is the perfect incarnation of these cultural differences. This is definitely not a Disney film, and this comes from a Disney fan.I cry at Disney films, but I couldn't with 'Grave of the Fireflies', there was a pain somewhere but it was just too heavy a feeling to let it flow through tears. 'Grave of the Fireflies' made me sad in a way I didn't expect, silent, almost peaceful. It is a sad story, there's no doubt about it. it is probably the saddest story I ever saw in a film, and I already knew that Japanese animated series could be devastating, but the film is sad because it is real and it is simple. There's no narrative, there's life and I knew how cruel it could get.When I saw the way Setsuko was sulking in the beginning, it immediately reminded me of my daughter, she's 3 and she makes the same facial expressions, the same grimaces. And when she wakes up in the middle of the night and yells for her Mommy, now, that too, hit a very sensitive chord. This is no Elsa and Anna playing with snow balls, this is a real teenage boy and a real little sister, the scene where they take a bath together and he catches that air bubble with a towel finished to convince me that it was going to be a very special experience. And it says something important, it's not a film about childhood in the sense that it captures the innocence or children, but simply because it shows children who feel real: as playful, ingenuous, smart, naive and lazy as any other child in the world. And actually, the story reveals more about the cruelty of the adult world and its devastating effects on two disarmed kids. It's precisely because they're too limited as children that I somewhat 'accepted' their fate.Because the story is not about playing, it's not about the grave of the fireflies (which I supposed would play a significant part to the story), it's just about a boy trying to feed his sister. There's no trick behind it, there's no childhood symbolism, even in a great films like 'Life is Beautiful', you can argue that the father is not just trying to protect his son's life, but his spirit too. In 'Grave of the Fireflies', the hell with the spirit, it's about the basic need for food, survival, and if it takes bombings to set people in the shelters so Seita can steal food and clothes, so the hell with patriotism.People invoke the motherland and patriotism, but when confronted to hunger and fraternal love, they become empty words. But the situation can be reversed, where in the name of patriotism, there's no room for sentimentality. I hated the character of the aunt but I loved her as a character. She wasn't heartless, she would've been the most lovable person in peacetime, but because of war, pity and empathy were feelings she couldn't afford, this is why she kept pressuring Seita to earn his ration of rice or couldn't stand Seitsuko's cries, that was harsh but that was realistic. That reminded me of the scene in 'Schindler's List' when a kid hides under a toilet hole, only to find other kids telling him to go to another hiding place. See, there can't be a great War film that isn't an Anti-War film, because War is simply the antithesis of humanity. That's the tragedy of Seita and Seitsuko, they're entrapped in a world where everything is to be earned, even a little girl, the purest and most fragile creature should earn her right to live, through her brother's effort, and although stealing is an option, it relies on luck until it runs out. Sure, they love each other, but this is no Disney material, even love can't triumph over reality. Worse, the tragedy could be avoided, Seita could come back to his aunt's or go to the bank earlier. But I accept these flaws because they come from a boy who's resourceful and admirable but who has his limitations too. Sometimes, his aunts had a point and it seemed like he took it easy for a little while until it backfired at him. When he left the aunt's house, you could tell she was hurt but she had too much pride to tell them to stay. And we, as an audience, also figured that the boy would take care of his sister, but 'parenting' cannot be improvised, and more than that, Seita was a child, too. He did the best he could 'physically', but 'mentally', he wasn't ready. That's his tragedy. After all, we can also wonder how he ended up dying anyway after his sister. Apparently, he couldn't even find a job or maybe he just let himself die. I hate plot contrivances when they lead to a happy ending, but when they have tragic consequences, they stopped being contrived, they just illustrate the fact that life can be cruel and capricious. Definitely not a Disney film.",10,0,1,13 December 2016
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," One of these instances when the last ten minutes of a movie elevate it to a haunting level of greatness.
","Mark Herman's 'Boy in the Striped Pyjamas' doesn't quite prepare you to how great it is, simply because everything happens in the end, and gives its full meaning to the poignant but rather predictable material featured in the first two acts.And watching this movie, I knew I would find comments on IMDb echoing my sentiment. After that extraordinary climax, I just told my wife: 'this is the best ending the film could ever have', and by that, I meant the most logical and satisfying. She thought the film would show something more after that painful shot on the outside of the gas chamber and the remaining clothes, but I knew the film would immediately close, as it had made its point, and quite a powerful one. It's really one of these instances when the last ten minutes of a movie elevate it to a haunting level of greatness.Yes, the film is about a German boy, Bruno (played by Asa Butterfield) who doesn't know the extents of the atrocities committed by the very men he worships (or used to), including his father, which all naturally leads him to befriend a Jewish kid in a death camp, named Schmuel. Yes, childhood innocence at wartime and unlikely friendships are very common themes, and even the encounters between the two boys, at each side of barbed wire fences, doesn't really strike for its originality, but it's all in the last ten minutes, when Bruno dies in the gas chamber, with his friend and other men.And it's not about being happy for Bruno's death but since it was the worst punishment his father (David Thewlis) could ever have, yes it was a worthy sacrifice from a pure 'Karma' standpoint, in order to inflict the heartless officer what he's been routinely conducting toward innocent people. Even worse for him, is that the death of his son could have been easily avoided, if he had simply told him what the camp was about, and what they were doing there. Sure, that would have tarnished Bruno's admiration but he would have thought twice before playing games near the camp. And this is where the characterization of Bruno works and his fate, although tragic, is a great pay-off.Bruno is shown as a rather detached and solitary kid, less passionate and fanatic than his sister Gretel, but he's not all brave and courageous for all that, just curious and sweet. The title with the 'pyjama' description is a hint that the story is seen from an innocent child's perspective. And when Bruno is confronted to that young officer's anger, he denies being Schmuel's friend, which is a rather cowardly move. And even when he enters the camp, he seems very reluctant, so it must have taken one hell of a blind courage to ignore the risks of setting a foot in a camp. And this is the point: Bruno couldn't realize it, not because he was blind, but because he was blinded.The Germans supposedly ignored what happened in the Camp, so that when the Allies and Russians liberated them, they were shocked to discover the truth. Even the news report of a camp was pure propaganda, showing healthy prisoners eating and playing football. The German people believed it, because they wanted to believe it, they didn't want to think their leaders were Barbarians. And Bruno illustrates that mindset, when he sees the newsreel, he goes hug his father, suddenly becoming a good man who takes care of war prisoners. He was blinded by the propaganda, by his father's lies and also by his love as a son, as the Germans loved (for most of them) Hitler. It takes a believer to lie.As for the liar, Bruno's father knew what he did and we can wonder, if he's so proud of his actions and so confident that they're meant to save the German motherland, so why doesn't he openly talk about it? is it guilt or shame? No, pure denial. Denying people their right to live and exist, and denying that these actions are innately evil. The father is so wrapped up in that evil madness that he hypocritically kills people believing it's good while hiding this reality to his son, as if it wasn't so good. And this is where you reach the genius of the film, almost imperceptible, because it doesn't feel like a Spielberg or Polanski's super-production.Indeed, the soul of this film is an evil one. Sure, the father could have come at the last minute, or the shower be a real shower, like in 'Schindler's List', but the father's arc had to be closed that way. He was the antagonist of the film, and the two kids' sacrifices the tool Destiny or Karma or God used to punish him. In fact, the film works like a reverse 'Life is Beautiful', while Benigni pretended it was a game to keep his son's innocence and save his life, in 'The Boy in Striped Pyjamas', the reality of the death camp is ignored by Bruno, and his maintained innocence ironically seals his fate.It's a tragic film but the irony is delightful because the father is responsible for his kids' obliviousness to the danger of the camp. And there's more to that, it is often asked how come the prisoners never fought or how come the Jews let themselves being arrested. Apart from the fact that this question ignores some heroic resistances, it also shows the sad reality, many of the Jewish people who died in these camps didn't know they would die, or that it would go as far as being separated from their families and put in gas chambers. And when you think about it, Bruno and even Schmuel, had the same mindset.Anything could happen, but death... yet it did, it was the most tragically satisfying ending the film could get.",8,0,0,13 May 2016
Brave," A Bag(pipe) of Contradictions...
","One is never too old for Disney or Pixar; their stories can resonate as strongly in a child than an adult's heart, or are supposed to anyway. The fact is that something definitely changed and I think I can finally figure what. There was a time where Disney movies were addressed to children and to the inner child inside of every adult, now it seems like an opposite trend, the stories are meant to awaken the adult in every child. Children have been gifted the power of imagination, dreams and risk-loving curiosity and these values have always been integral to Disney and Pixar's appeals, but in the 2010's, this (rather sane) philosophy was somewhat turned into an obsession in 'empowering' kids, as potential adults. Especially girls.It can be a sign of modernity if you accept that the usual stories don't elicit the same response they used to, that girls are not interested in princesses or heroines seeking the great love, and that chivalry is not only dead but also decomposed. I would accept it if I was sure it was true. But Pixar has never been into fairy tales anyway; the previous movies always exhilarated positive values like friendship ('Toy Story'), community ('A Bug's Life'), tolerance ('Monsters, Inc.') etc. But it's like 'Brave' came to a point where the 'millennial' generation became the prime target and some executives decided that these kids needed different role models to shape their personalities.Now, I can see the brainstorming that lead to a film like 'Brave', certainly full of great intentions, Pixar's first heroine, let's make her a strong, independent female protagonist (what was the Little Mermaid? A 50's shopping housewife?), let's make her a rebellious teen that wouldn't care about marrying a prince. The problem is that whoever came up with the concept of 'Merida' had just answered half the question, if she didn't care about being a princess, what would she care about? By not picking a specific goal, they just made a 'rebel without a cause'. That doesn't quite work with animation whose stories must rely on a particular goal: being a real boy or finding Nemo.And I used the term 'rebel' because that's the French title that mislead the audience, we all thought it was about a girl who had a personal reason to be a warrior. Actually, Merida just doesn't want to be chaperoned by her mother. The idea is that girls can do whatever they like, they can play boy's games as there are no gender barriers, yet the film can't seem to find the proper conflict to convey that message, something 'Mulan' did, so they had to come up with the idea of a spell turning the mother into a bear a disastrous move. Indeed, not only does this completely ruin the premise but also since the spell is caused by Merida's rebellion, it implies that her attitude was faulty.There were infinite possibilities with such a starting point, the audience could expect something fresh and original from studios with no history of strong heroines. And on that level, the first twenty minutes were breathtaking and excitingly promising, Merida, voiced by Kelly Mac Donald was starting to grow on me, even the tormented relationship with Queen Elinor (Emma Thompson) reflected a strong personality in the mother-side and I loved the more comprehensive personality of the father Fergus, (Billy Connolly) and the whole family brawl escalated with fun and energy until the tournament between the clans, to choose the future husband, and the twist involving Merida challenging the boys to have her own hand was the moment I believed 'Brave' deserved its title.And then well, I should have suspected these Will-o'-the-wisp were not put in the opening scene for nothing, but it's like someone else involved in the writing, just tore up the original version and came up with the beastly spell. Did such an exciting coming-of-age story set in the Highlands need to be reliant on magic, à la Disney? Couldn't Merida learn find her own path another way? The film betrays its own message, it's not through archery or bravery that she undoes the spell, it's through sewing and compromising, so much for the feminist message! And the worst thing is that there's a subplot involving another man who turned into a bear because he wanted to follow his path. Speaking of contradictions, 'Brave' is some head-scratcher.And I feel even more angry because I enjoyed the beginning, the wild personality of Merida and her frizzy curls, her goofy father and bossy mother, even the other clansmen were as fun as they were useless to the plot, but I was ready to follow that fiery energy, instead of these blue magic things, but something failed, which made me understand why they just went full frontally feminist in 'Frozen' the year after. The film wasn't devoid of contradictions either but that's because movies like 'Little Mermaid' or 'Beauty and the Beast' or 'Mulan' had strong female characters already and were not the result of some marketing so obsessed into making things differently, it makes them awkwardly. Come on, turning the mother into a beast, what were they thinking?'Brave' was supposed to embrace her heroine's rebellion, yet that's what caused trouble, Merida refused to be forced to marry someone then she conceded she should marry the boy she wants, so it wasn't about marriage anymore. Then she admitted she changed at the end, yet there was nothing that was supposed to change in her attitude, and even if she changed, it was emergency, it's not like she had a choice. Finally, the film was supposed to be groundbreaking yet it relies on so many overused and contrived magical devices it almost reached the 'ex machina' level.'Brave' had a great premise, and a terrific start but just too many contradictions to be fully appreciated, and too needlessly long to be enjoyed.",6,1,2,19 April 2017
The Imitation Game," Alan Turing: saved millions of lives through artificial intelligence, and killed by human stupidity...
","World War II wasn't won on the battlefields but on the field of intelligence as information was the nerve of the war to the point the Allies not only needed German information but to let false ones leak from 'spies' or arrests in order to mislead the Axis. Secret as well as human intelligence were involved but WWII allowed a third form of intelligence to rise.When Alan Turing, a brilliant mathematician played by Benedict Cumberbatch, is applying to a job in Bletchey Park, things don't go as well as expected, his commander Denniston (Charles Dance) opens the door, ready to throw this cocky self-absorbed prick away, Turing utters one word: Enigma, and Denniston closes the door. And I was enthralled already by the premise because Enigma was probably the only name I remembered from a 2000's documentary series about how the world war was (really won) and I knew Enigma was beaten by the ancestor of our modern computers.I'm a math buff and a real nerd who loves crosswords and plays on words, so I could relate to Turing who took Enigma as an intellectual challenge, on which millions of lives were pending. The Germans had made a machine that could encrypt codes made of complex and apparently random sequences of letters and with a new coding system each day, which makes a combination of billions and billions of possibilities to work on every day and after midnight, having to get back from scratch, over and over again. Even by hiring people working on different codes without stopping, day and night, the amount of time required to break the codes would be counted in millenniums.Alan Turing leads team that includes a champion chess player Hugh Alexander (Matthew Goode) and later, a crossword prodigy Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley), but only he knew it would more than human minds to break Enigma, his project was to create an artificial intelligence, a universal machine to do the job at faster speed than human brain, imitating our brains process, our maybe improving them. The film chronicles the process that allowed him to get to decrypt the code and while it works on the thriller level, there's more to appreciate, 'The Imitation Game' is not just a study on math and information but on fascinating man who finally gets his long overdue recognition.While striking as an individualistic snob, Alan Turing gets progressively more complex as we get hints of his past experiences with bullying and a growing childhood romance that leaves no doubt about Turing's sexuality. In fact, it is very fascinating that his passion for cryptography came from the 'I love you' messages he sent to his friend, as if math wasn't just a passion, but an area of total freedom, a mirror of personal truth where he could express himself to the fullest. He had made math his own world, but only with the value of team-working, he could overcome the obstacles, including the patronizingly antagonistic attitude of Denniston.But I didn't care much for these 'dramatic' bits that, while not unbelievable, were not worthy of such a complex personality, I doubt that Denniston could really order to destroy the machine or if he submitted that deadline. The film also suffers from similarly doubtful moments: I couldn't believe Joan Clarke wouldn't want to join the team, I mean didn't a MI6 official tell them that they were serving the country? She was just contemptibly dismissed by a nosy clerk who took her for a secretary and now, she wouldn't take part to a project because her parents thought it wasn't correct? The film didn't need these moments, Turing's story was enough good material.I must admit I was first perplex about the part involving his sexuality but it became apparent that this was a part of Turing's life that couldn't be overlooked because it highlighted the tragedy of a man who saved millions of peoples' lives but never got the credit he deserved, on the contrary, he faced a public indignity because of a sexual scandal, which indirectly lead him to suicide. That a man who saved people, who should be seen as a benefactor of humanity, had his legacy ignored for years made me realize two things: math are too abstract and people believe what they see, virtually, Turning saved people but no one could materialize it, to measure up the glory of his work.There's a magnificent moment where the code is broken and when his friend is ready to jump at a phone and prevent a ship bombing, Turing stops him. If they change the course of the war right now, Nazis will immediately cancel Enigma and annihilate their years of research. That's a subtlety that is extremely hard to accept, sacrificing thousands of people, to save millions, or to shorten the war, one could say that Turing let British people die, but maybe this act itself has saved millions others. But human intelligence is too blind to see it, what a tragic irony that the man who saved millions of people with artificial intelligence was sacrificed on the altar of human stupidity.But the film at least respect our intelligence and says a lot without words, two standout moments I got at the first viewing: Alan tells Joan about the machine's name, Christopher, something is odd and she doesn't mention it, and yes, it took me a few seconds to realize that I expected a woman's name. And that was a brilliant hint of Alan's homosexuality before the revelation. A second moment is when he's in London train station with Joan and mothers and soldiers stare at him with disdain, he's obviously seen like a coward. How ironic that they'll never know this man is as heroic as them.'The Imitation Game' is an imperfect film but from the subject it handles and its importance, it is as highly recommendable as if it was a masterpiece.",8,1,1,8 May 2017
The Piano," A tiny, mute, 19th century woman speaking huge, loud and modern statements about love and passion...
","I must have been misinformed about 'The Piano'. I've always thought it was going to be one of these insufferably long movies that take the words slow and dim-lit as synonyms of deep and profound, these films where you try to convince your mind that it's genius while you have a hard time sitting through five minutes without checking your phone, or maybe I thought it was a sort of pseudo-feminist movie meant to content the elitist tastes and earn a Golden Palm on that biased bass.But what the hell I know? 'The Piano' is a straightaway romance, full of heat and passion like you rarely see in movies, and where all the players, no pun intended, cut straight to your heart. A few movies make you feel for their protagonists like 'The Piano' does and I guess it says a lot about the sensitivity of Jane Campion who wrote and directed a magnificent story of souls lost in the middle of nowhere, trying to live in a pretension of civilization among wilderness, only to discover their own wild desires, triumphing over the hypocritical pretension of 'marriage', and with a piano, of all the matchmakers. Who would have thought that a tiny and mute woman from the 19th century would indirectly speak so many huge, loud and modern statements about love and passion.I was going to praise the modernity of the author who wrote the original novel, expecting a figure à la Jane Austen or Eyre, but then I read that it was an original screenplay. What Campion did was to assemble many familiar topics from these literature classics while infusing them into a personal idea of feminist heroism, and it works because Ada is one hell of a creation by Campion and Holly Hunter. This is a woman who had an illegitimate child, a mini-Ada named Flora (Anna Paquin); only in the edge of the world, a man accepted to marry her, an uptight British landowner (if you can call lands these swampy muddy traps) named Stewart (Sam Neill) who emigrated with his Aunt (Kelly Walker) and her dim-witted servants. He recreated a microcosm of England in the midst of New Zealand's bush, he needs to recreate the illusion of marriage.But from the opening start where we see Ada and Flora being carried by the sailors on the beach to the way their frail bodies literally sink into the mud, we have the signal that this is a very awkward setting and things won't turn out as we expect with this kind of material. You have indeed that texture that belongs to period pieces or Ivory/Merchant productions but in a territory where man can hardly set the mark of progress or civilization. You can't just conquer the land easily, and it is fascinating how Ada embodies that notion. This is a woman who chose to be silent at the age of six until it confined to muteness. She revolted against the patriarchal system, her muteness is part of her character and she's got it more than any 'normal' woman Stewart would have married, but he takes her muteness the wrong way and commits the worst mistake by abandoning her only valuable item: the piano, on the beach, because the Maori natives can't carry it.Stewart misunderstood Ada, he thought Flora was the translator of her feelings, but Flora is a free-spirited angel (almost literally) that doesn't need to be everywhere with her mother, but to understand Ada is to listen to her music and understand her love for the piano. Modern visions of love sometimes put 'understanding' far above love and respect, Stewart respected Ada but the one who understood her could win her heart, and the rival was George Baines, played by Harvey Keitel. George is an adventurer with a face marked by Maori tattoos, and when he hears Ada playing piano for the first time, he understands how he can reach her. He sells a land to Stewart in exchange of the piano and courses from Ada. Ada is reluctant until she sees the extent of the bargain, for each course, she'll get a black key symbolically, when the count is down, she takes her piano back.This is the start of some of the most powerful erotic relationships of recent time, one where you can pinpoint the transfer of power between Baines and Ada. It comes to the moment where he raises the price just to be able to touch her neck, and later, when he gives three keys so she can lift her skirt, she's shocked but then suggest five, they settle at four. Both have the power, the piano is just a decoy, an excuse to let them play with their fantasies. It is the credit to a filmmaker who assumes her feminism to have portrayed a relationship where the man has the upper hand only because the woman gives her blessing. She doesn't see herself as a whore, she simply values Baines' fascinatingly awkward ways to reach her. And like Campion said, sometimes a man's extreme masculinity reveals a woman's extreme femininity. 'The Piano' is about characters who repressed their feelings for too long until a piano would open their eyes and the rest.'The Piano' is served by a terrific bittersweet score from Michael Nyman, stellar performances from Hunter and Paquin, who won Oscars, as well as Campion for her thought-provoking script, while her directing was intelligent and sensitive, especially with this attention to such details like Flora acting like a child and not being unrealistically smart or the way the Maori were portrayed, on an equal foot with the Whites, and even showing how hard it was for women to get the simplest things done, like going to the bathroom.'The Piano' is melancholic, captivating, haunting but inspirational because it's about people who simply learn to become honest and 'eloquent' about their feelings.",10,1,4,17 March 2017
Shrek 2," A little bit of 'Meet the Parents', a little bit of 'Aladdin' and the first 'Shrek', but it's still good......
","The impending doom on sequels' is that they inevitably lack the element of surprise and can hardly wow the audience with the same intensity than the original.But this is a double edged-sword because the more successful the first opus is, the more attractive the immediate sequel will be to herds of fans eager to see their beloved characters again. A sequel suffer by comparison only if the level is beneath the original's, otherwise, it is seen as a faithful continuation, style-wise, fun-wise, characterization-wise and quality-wise. I guess it's fair to say that 'Shrek 2' belongs to that category of sequels and the opening gags make you quickly understand the movie will be swimming in safe waters as far as entertainment goes, and you only wish that it will manage to give you something you don't see coming. After all, as I said in the first film's review, Shrek, Fiona and Donkey are so multi-layered characters that 'Shrek' wasn't a movie enough to use up all their potential.Many questions deserved answers, how about Fiona's parents, the very people who locked her in the tower so a Prince Charming would cure her from the spell and then she would come back? How about the very prince Charming whom Shrek stole the thunder, why not making a character out of him, one who'd cross the forests and deserts, climbs the highest tower only to find her gone, and with quite a hilarious replacement, that I won't spoil. In fact, the reason to be of the sequel can be reduced to one simple question: how about the hackneyed concept of 'And They Lived Happily Ever After'? Since 'Shrek' was a parody of fairy tales, it made all the more sense to question the most formulaic aspect of fairy tales, the ending! And since 'Shrek's magnificent ending opened more doors than it closed, I doubt the brainstorming session on the sequel's themes lasted very long.So, the set is tone with Charming (Rupert Everett) realizing he was stepped over by nothing but an ogre, and the two ogres enjoying a nice honeymoon, and the first big laugh comes from a parody of 'From Here to Eternity' and a very naughty take on Disney. The honeymoon lasts the time of the 'Accidentally in Love' song and when our greenish couple is back home, they have two visits: Donkey (who else?) as obnoxious and oblivious to his obnoxiousness as ever and representatives of the Royal Family, which means from Shrek's standpoint, his in-laws. And what can be more annoying than traveling to the Kingdom of Far Far Away, with the Donkey shouting 'Are we there yet' every 2,5 milliseconds. The film almost affords the luxury to make a joke out of boredom and I asked myself, where this was going, not without concern, with the perspective of meeting the in-laws, I was waiting for the gags with the 'are we there yet?' question in mind.Anyway, the discovery of Far Far Away, which is like a fairy-tale version of Beverly Hills is one of the film's delights, and it is intelligently enhanced by the choice of the background music 'Funky Town'. The rest of the story is less funky as the King (John Cleese) and the Queen (Julie Andrews) try to restrain their emotions, and the laughs that come from the confrontation between the King and Shrek are fun but on a very adult way, even by the film's standards. So, we get to a brief but perceptible part where gags tend to rarefy and the film gets too dramatic for its own good, just the time to present the villainous Godmother (Jennifer Saunders) who happens to be the mother of Prince Charming. The film gets back to its trademark zaniness once a character makes his entrance: Puss in Boots, a cross between Garfield and Zorro and who else than Antonio Banderas to voice him in a self-parodying performance (there's a lot of things borrowed from his Mariachi).Any experienced movie buff will look at the cat as a gratuitous addition in order to spice up the story, and you know what, it's true but who cares? The animators are much aware about it so even the Donkey says 'the part of the annoying animal sidekick has been taken'. He's half right, except the cat isn't just a sidekick, he's the character for which the sequel is remembered, he's a great source of gags, because he's both funny when acting like a Zorro (the accent, the mannerisms) and even funnier when acting like a real cat: purring, coughing hairballs and having that sad face that make anyone go 'Aaaaaw'. It all comes to any rating of 'Shrek' gets 1 or 2 points more thanks to the cat.And that was a salutary addition because the story, as exciting as it was, was getting slow before the cat came and after, felt like a reverse recycling of the first movie, this time, Shrek turns into a human version of the prince Charming (and so does Donkey who finally gets a taste of what being a noble steed is like) and together, they pull a sort of 'Prince Ali' on Fiona, before the Godmother pulls a Jafar in a climax that owes its excitement to the music that plays in the background, and the involvement of all the characters that made the first film such a delight: the three pigs, the Gingerbread guy, Pinocchio and the wolf.So, with all its reference to the first film, to modern classics, to adult humor (in a kids-friendly way) 'Shrek 2' is a solid continuation to the original one. Maybe 'Shrek 2' shouldn't be compared to the original but to all the second opuses of successful series' starters, and on that level, it is a great one.",8,0,1,30 July 2016
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," In 2003, Master Tarantino Forged us his Finest Movie ...
","A big slap in the face proving me once and for all that Quentin Tarantino is the most gifted and creative director of his generation. 'Kill Bill Vol. 1' isn't just one of the most thrilling and stylish action films ever, but also a captivating tale of revenge, justice, honor and redemption, incarnated by one of the most iconic characters of the 2000's, 'The Bride' : Uma Thurman in an Oscar worthy performance. And not only 'Kill Bill' is a career-defining film for Tarantino, the director, but it also establishes his unique talent as a storyteller.The movie opens with a blood-splattered face that belongs to 'The Bride', whose name will be 'beeped' all through the film. We see the massacre and foresee the recurrent theme in Tarantino's films : revenge, defined by the opening sentence as 'a dish served cold' and the haunting music that interrupts the Bride's 'Bill, it's your baby ' directly plunges us in the darkness of her comatose state while she mourns an irreplaceable loss and wonders why 'her baby shot her down'. As usual, music plays a crucial part in a Tarantino film, with this unique power to get us in the right mood, and I can't think of any movie that pulled the strings of my emotions with such virtuosity, I can't think of a movie with a greater soundtrack. Music is Tarantino's language that translates what images and words can't express. And considering the film's style and the scenario, this is saying a lot.'Kill Bill' pays tribute to the famous Kung-fu Asiatic B-movies that replaced the Western Spaghetti during the 70's. These movies were famous for their choreographed fighting, Shakespearian-themed badly dubbed over-the-top dialogs, and stylish violence. What they lacked in budget, they made it up with style, something that the action genre cruelly lacks now. Call them cheesy, dated, laughable, but never underestimate the talent required for probably the most difficult genre to handle. Action requires a meticulous editing, and a tactful direction, and more than anything, it needs authenticity in the story, the hero, the motives, the emotions. 'The Bride' is a wonderful cinematic creation embodying all the classic heroic virtues, a woman who got the crap of her life, beaten, husband and relatives massacred by Bill, leader of the 'Deadly Viper Assassination Squad', and an unborn child. She couldn't even get a break at the hospital, when the nurse, Buck, used her as a sex doll. But Buck brings a client the wrong night when she decided she won't take it anymore. He gets his comeuppance, and she gets her car, poetic justice.The fight scenes in 'Kill Bill' transcend the charm of 70's Kung-fu films, revering through them a whole culture, that brought up so many iconic images and beautiful stories of virtue and courage. As a kid who grew up with the mangas, I can't describe how I felt when watching the chapter about O'Ren Ishi, and how the violence orchestrated by the incredible Luis Bacalov's 'Big Duel' music brought tears to my eyes. And our empathy to O'Ren's back-story foreshadows our satisfaction when The Bride will get her revenge. When O'Ren kills Boss Matsumoto who ordered the death of her parents, she was literally savoring his blood like the exquisite taste of the cold dish. More than the music, the images, the action, 'Kill Bill' takes time to introduce all the Bride's targets on which she swore revenge. The first to die is Vernita Green, now a homemaker with a five-year old girl, coincidentally the same age as the Bride's daughter  if she was alive. She'll witness the brutal death of her mother, a sad illustration of the implacable 'eye for an eye' rule.Each character has one moment to shine in. Elle Driver is introduced under a nurse's disguise, visiting the comatose Bride for a lethal injection, whistling the iconic 'Twisted Nerve' theme, before a serene male voice interrupts her and cancels the order for ethical reasons. O'Ren is chronologically the first target, her crew is composed by Gogo Yubari, a sadist schoolgirl-dressed bodyguard, Sofie Fatale as the half-French, half-Japanese right-hand and her henchmen, the Crazy 88, lead by Johnny Mo. Before getting O'Ren, The Bride asks the legendary sword-smith Hattori Santo to forge her a sword. This part is the last calm little moment before the storm, conducted by the beautiful Zhamfir's score 'The Lonely Shepherd'. Here again, I applaud Tarantino's musical taste as the themed beautifully embodied Samurai values with a Morriconesque melody, a beautiful melancholic sound before the music gets more frenetic. Following the 'Bumblebee' song, the Bride tails O'Ren in Tokyo to the last stand in a Japanese restaurant, where a bare-feet female band plays some catchy Japanese Rockabilly.The fight that follows is the climax the movie needed, screaming villains, sounds of strident gurgles, geysers of blood painting the floor in red, over-the-top, stylish, a pastiche of whatever fascinates us in Martial Arts films. And we know the Bride will be victorious, because she deserves to. And Tarantino has a way to show the fight, after having thrilled us with a poetry that would have made Kurosawa proud, the last shot of the Bride dominating the restaurant's floor is like a 'Ran' painting. And the concluding fight with O'Ren, with the 'Santa Esmeralda's instrumental sound, concludes with O'Ren apologizing for having mocked the Bride, as a last redemption ... before joining her parents.Of course, the movie features Tarantino's trademarks, the non-linear narrative structure edited by the late Sally Menke, the action, the violence, a foot-fetish to the extreme (not for my displeasure though) but more than anything, it's about honor and revenge, and the last minute featuring the shots of the second volume, transported me again with Zhamfir's music, brining some tears back, and hooking my heart with one of the most shocking finales ever, with the last line starting by 'One more thing, Sofie '",10,3,8,24 July 2011
The Last Emperor," This Emperor Does Have Clothes
","The poster of 'The Last Emperor' shows a chubby little boy in ceremonial dress with the majestic palace of the Forbidden City in the background. While richly evocative, it will probably give the wrong idea to the audiences expecting 'another' costume historical drama, or one of these sweeping Oscar-swiping epics. Not to mention that the last emperor of China doesn't play in the same league than Gandhi or Lawrence of Arabia, as far as historical magnitudes go.But it's precisely because the last emperor of China wasn't exactly an icon or a major history player that his story works on a narrative level, he's passive enough to be a foil to the more turbulent history of China, but strong-willed enough to drive the story within his own 'limited' power. Yes, 'limited' is the word and what an irony for the ruler of the largest and most secular Empire in the world to have spent his whole life powerless. Indeed, summoned to the Forbidden City as a toddler, his childhood coincided with the Republican era where his power never exceeded the limits of the Forbidden City which didn't prevent him from an imperial upbringing with its gallery of bowing servants and playing eunuchs. These scenes look like your typical history epic material except that Bertolucci makes the right choice by telling the story through flashbacks. It actually opens with the arrest of Pu Yi (John Lone) after World War II and his transfer to Funchu Prison as a War criminal and traitor. One would think that death is the penalty awaiting him, he even tries to precedes his executioners by cutting his wrists, and feeling a washbasin with such a symbolic red, but People's Republic of China has other plans for the last living remain of the old order. Pu Yi is coerced into confessing his crimes, and his collaboration with the Japanese regime whose actions against Chinse people have been overshadowed by the Holocaust.Pu Yi's motives become all murky yet captivating from a narrative level: was he driven by ambition? Was he holding a grudge against the Republic that dethroned him? Bertolucci doesn't take a specific side apart from showing a man who's been out of touch all his life, and one-step behind the march of history. There's a crucial moment during his reign over the puppet state of Manchouko, where he makes a speech meant to assert the independence of the country, the Japanese diplomats leave the place, followed by the Chinese staff. Pu Yi realizes that a ruler of men, he'll never be. This scene occurs at the two thirds of the film but it adds a new tragicomic dimension to all the protocol and ceremonials from the first act.Indeed, what makes 'The Last Emperor' such a compelling story is that the film never seems to 'endorse' what it shows, it clearly has a stance over the imperial over-zealous decorum, and as viewers, we can only empathize with Pu-Yi when he transitions from an obedient kid to the rebellious young man who goes as far as cutting his plait. The character of Johnston, Peter O'Toole as the Scottish mentor, is crucial, because he's Pu Yi's window to the Occidental world, literally opening his eyes since he's the one forcing the imperial establishment to buy the Emperor glasses. He also teaches him how to ride a bicycle, which leads to another crucial scene where Pu-Yi learns he can't even leave the City, another eloquent irony. The fascination toward the Occidental world is obvious and Pu Yi, as well as his new wife Wanrong (Joan Chen) grow progressively Occidentalised until they finally get fully rid of their traditional burden after the Republican coup, and their exile from the City. Later, Pu Yi is shown singing Bing Crosby during a reception, which establishes the long road from that 'golden child' of the start. The film shows natural born outcasts, caught in the turmoil of a time that made their collaboration with Japan tragic because it was inevitable. Pu Yi's concubine becomes a Japanese spy and is quite vocal about it, Wanrong becomes an opium addict, and Pu Yi a traitor to his own country.But the film takes an interesting angle toward the end, it doesn't make the Chinese regime more evil than we'd expect, although it doesn't sugarcoat the devastating effects of the Chinese revolution. One of the camp commandants encourages Pu Yi to confess his crimes, as the step for redemption is the awareness of guilt, but for the real crimes. Pu Yi collaborated with the Japanese but he could never have known about the biological crimes. His re-education reaches a new level when the commandant realizes he can't even tie his shoe or do anything alone, he's put in a cell where he must live in community, and learn the hardship of being one-among-the- others, and obeying certain rules, like to pee in silent on the side of a bucket.Finally, we see him at the twilight of his life, as a free, serene gardener who have embraced the spirit of new China, the film comes full circle with his life when he meets a child in the Forbidden city and tells him he used to be the Emperor, and gives him a pet cricket he received when he first sat on the throne. It's quite fascinating that he was the exception to the rule, the one person who could have been positively affected by the Chinese revolution, since he spent all his life like a living anachronism and was the perfect candidate for a re-education, and a life full of such ironies was a perfect candidate for a biopic.And behind its Best Picture prestige facade, 'The Last Emperor' is a powerful character study of a man, whose transition echoed his own country, because like China, the Last Emperor had to make his own (r)evolution.",9,1,1,21 July 2017
Jerry Maguire," Behind every great man, there is a (great) woman ...
","Is 'Jerry Maguire' a heart-warming romantic comedy with sports as a subplot? Or a sports drama with romantic undertones? Or is it a fascinating character study introspecting the professional and private life of a sports pro manager, and the way these two poles of his personality influence and affect each other? I like the third option, especially since the title says it all; it's a film about a man named Jerry Maguire.So, who's Jerry Maguire? At first, he strikes as the kind of character tailor-made for Tom Cruise; Maguire is the guy who's successful both in business and privacy. In fact, the two worlds interact so intensively that you can't quite differentiate between his friends, his colleagues and his clients, even his fiancé, Avery (Kelly Preston) is an ex-athlete. Tom Cruise is the ultimate yuppie and he plays the part perfectly with this extraordinary capability to make himself unlikable enough so you can better perceive his redemption, the same way he did in 'Rain Man'. But 'Jerry Maguire', as if Cameron Crowe, the director, was already aware of its viewers' expectations, is pleasantly surprising because the redemption comes right at the beginning.After a series of eye-opening incidents, one night, Jerry wakes up and has a sort of breakthrough illumination; he realizes that he wasted his life, by cumulating a generous quantity of clients (professional athletes) without taking time to understand them, to deal with them in a decent way. Struck by this rebirth of humanity, he writes an inspirational memo titled 'Things We Think But Do Not Say'. The memo elevates him into a sports management guru status except that he's the only one who seems to believe in his new humanistic theories  him, and a young accountant, Dorothy Boyd (Renee Zelwegger) who 'saw the light' through Maguire's inspirational words. And naturally, when Maguire is forced to leave the company, she's the only one who chooses to follow him, she's the kind of women who stand for her beliefs.Then, Jerry and Dorothy work together with the only client who stays, Rod Tidwell, a football player, smaller than average, flamboyant, truculent  maybe a little too much, and he's played by a scene-stealing (and Oscar-winning) Cuba Gooding Jr. And it's funny how Gooding seems to embody the trademarks of Tom Cruise's archetypal characters through his cockiness and exuberance, but that's part of his 'character', I mean within the movie. Tidwell believes he's a great man, and naturally behind him, there's a woman, his wife Marcee (Regina King) who keeps a vigilant eye on his career's evolution. She doesn't trust Maguire but she gives it a shot. Tidwell trusts him and stays out of loyalty. And Boyd genuinely loves him because she knows there's something good inside that man. Maguire is a good guy because good people believe in him, and it works the other way, too.Indeed, the 'friends' in the beginning, the pedant Bob Sugar (Jay Mohr) and Avery, not to mention the cocky football player named Cush (whom I just discovered, was the chubby Vern from 'Stand By Me'), they all represent the dark side of Maguire's world, and it's only when he gets fired, when he leaves Avery and is betrayed by Cush' father who ends up signing with Sugar (leaving Tidwell as Maguire's only option), it's only when he's an outsider from that cynical world, that we start rooting for him. And Cruise is perfect because it's crucial that Maguire starts being unlikable enough so we can give him the benefit of the doubt and then supposedly change but not enough to make us lower our guard. The suspicion must remain whether he's a good or a bad guy, if he's going to make it because he believes in his ideas of if he's going to sell his soul back to the devil. It's a two- way process, Rod considers him a friend, not his wife. Dorothy loves him and so does her adorable little kid, Ray, but her sister (Bonnie Hunt) is perplexed. Well, we expect a happy ending, but it's all in the 'how' and 'when' it will happen. The film deals with human relationships with a powerful mix of cleverness suitable for a comedy drama and touching tenderness, incarnated by the beautiful Renee Zelwegger, in a breakthrough performance that should have earned her an Oscar nomination. She's so adorable, so unbelievably sweet, that she puts something new and unusual in romantic comedies: genuine, shameless, passionate and innocent love. There is something quite gutsy in the way Cameron Crowe's film tries to cover sports, character study, romance in one story, but the multi-layered format works because Jerry Maguire remains the center of gravity. Dorothy Boyd is a great character because she awakens the best out of Jerry and saves him from his own megalomania. Ironically, Jerry does the same with Rod, also blinded by his own ego too and obsession with money. The way the two stories interact transcends a lot of predictable elements, and even when it doesn't avoid some archetypal situations, the acting makes everything believable. We know that Maguire will get back to Dorothy, but the way it's handled never feels forced and insincere. Jerry listens to Rod who's got the greatest day of his career, and he's simply talking to his wife. Jerry knows he can be a great man, but only if behind him, there's a woman, not any woman: a 'great' woman.The film is notorious for having introduced many iconic lines in Cinema's Dictionary: 'show me the money', 'you complete me' and last but not least 'you had me at 'hello'', a line that owes more to its awkwardness than romantic appeal. Interestingly, the romantic catchphrase was used in the American Film Institute's 100 Passions montage right after Nicholson's 'You make me want to be a better man'. And after watching 'Jerry Maguire', I understood this is exactly why Dorothy Boyd was a great woman.",8,1,1,6 October 2012
The Big Blue," Hello Blueness, my Old Friend...
","In 1956, Louis Malle's documentary 'The World of Silence' made an extraordinary sensation. Captain Cousteau showed to the world the unsuspected wonders underneath the blue surface we laconically call 'ocean' or 'sea'. Oceans, like the divine soup where the recipe of life was concocted, revealed the womb of Mother Nature: a fauna and flora that had nothing to envy on the world above the ground, and was for the first time caught by the camera's eye. The film won the Golden Palm and the Oscar for Best Documentary but the world had to wait for three decades so another French director would write a similar love to the greatest part of our world, in every sense of the world.From the very title, you know that Luc Besson deeply loved the ocean, this is no marketing titling, 'The Big Blue' is his 'world of silence', as unlimited as its invitation for dreams and contemplation, one that could evoke Simon and Garfunkel's melody, starting with 'Hello, Blueness my old friend', blueness as the color of the sky, dreams, life, purity, simply said, the most relaxing and eye-comforting color. Luc Besson is comfortably tucking us up and take us in a universe whose mystical nature is magnificently conveyed by Eric Serra's score. This is one of the most instantly recognizable French scores of history, and in pop-culture, has become synonym of a long and slow descent. The recurring theme sounds like some whale sounds, one that seems ominous, another more reassuring, disturbing yet weirdly absorbing. You don't get in the water, you become part of it.Indeed, contrarily to 'The World of Silence', men don't use respiratory devices or wear equipment, and those who do, meet a fate that seems like punishment for 'cheaters'. You don't cheat the ocean, it is like wilderness you try to tame, and you don't do it without being part of the wilderness yourself, the film isn't about typical divers, these are apneists. Loosely based on the sporting rivalry between two legends Jacques Maiol and Enzo Molinari, the film centers not just on their relationship but also their relationship with the sea and the rest of the world. And what makes the story so appealing is the triangle of characters made of Jean-Marc Barr, Jean Reno and Rosanna Arquette, each one incarnates one side of this triangle of feelings and misunderstandings.Jacques sees the sea as his world, his respiratory performances are exploited for the purpose of science but it's only with the dolphins that his humanity resurfaces. And Jean-Marc Barr plays him like an eternal mystery drown under the blueness of his eyes, an alien who can only feel if this feeling has any connection with the sea. Johana, the American who falls in love with him, represents the world, she's lovely, smiling, funny, loving but so desperately banal from Jacques' standpoint, yet they fall in love, and it's very fitting that the moment that 'breaks the ice' is set in the water. Finally, Enzo is the character who sticks in our mind, the bridge between the two worlds. He understands both Johana and Jacques, and his flamboyant and charismatic personality can only come from a man who has one foot in the water and one in the real world, the one that can admire him.Enzo is all hubris, he's the one who brings Jacques to the competition in Sicily, to set a record that's been pending ever since their childhood in Greece. Enzo is not the most competitive of the two, he's the only one, Jacques concedes 'you're the best', to which Enzo replies 'we'll see'. Enzo is a man of honor and can only taste his victory is it's real, his pride is his biggest weakness, so his sad fate doesn't come as a surprise. Because if there are three characters in the film, there is a fourth one too, and I'm not talking of the Dolphins. The ocean or water is omnipresent in the film but not just as a setting but a protagonist too, as if Besson cared less for what happened in the ocean than the aftermath.When drunken Jacques and Enzo fool around inside a pool, their hangover is one of a kind, when both treat water with respect and dedication, they are victorious, when Enzo pushes his luck too far, he only realizes he's a man when it's too late. The wit's soul is to know one's place, and the essence of the film is that indecisiveness in Jacques, to which world he belongs or maybe he made up his mind already, and that's his misfortune or Johana's tragedy, she who has Jacques' baby playing apnea in her belly, doesn't look at the Ocean as a mistress, but as the one that made Jacques such a wild animal she foolishly wanted to tame, but couldn't because she wasn't part of the wilderness. The ending is sad, but in such a poetical way it feels like the only satisfying one. Besson couldn't paint the ocean is such a cinematic majesty and not let the most humble of his character surrender to it.'The Big Blue' was the most successful movie of 1988, it became an instant classic thanks to its beautiful cinematography, its iconic score and the scene-stealing performance of 40-year old Jean Reno. Luc Besson wasn't a late bloomer and became the French 'it' director, the one who invented a style that could speak to the audience, mostly the youth (we even saw the film and studied it in 4th Grade). Sometimes, he seems to be much aware of his directing talent and overdoes it a little, too hip and stylish for its own good, even Reno's acting leans toward the comedic, and some unrealistic situations belong to another film as if Besson was also playing with camera like Enzo with water, when you look at the magnificent spectacle the camera achieves, you're ready to forgive all these little flaws..",8,0,1,3 August 2016
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Pay no attention to that man under the top hat...
","'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' has always been one of my favorite readings this is how I started my review of the 1971 version, the one with Gene Wilder, and I feel like an obligation to say it again for the 2005 adaptation. I don't know if I'm the book's biggest fan, probably not, but as a kid who loved chocolate, great story with great characters, I devoured every chapter of 'Charlie' as if they were made of cream-nut milk chocolate. So I think I can judge both movies' adaptations with all fairness, giving each one the credit it deserved.I'm not one of these movie purists who consider the 1971 version the better one on the sole basis that it is the first adaptation or dismiss the 2005 version because Johnny Depp's embodiment of Willy Wonka was leaning a bit too close to the psychopathic side and didn't have that zest of enchantment conveyed by ringmaster Gene Wilder. It is true though, whether it was intentional or not, Depp seemed to have channeled another similarly pale-faced figure of Pop Culture and the fact that he was concerned about children made it all the more creepy. But I think there is good and 'less good' material from each movie and Tim Burton, at least, had the merit to introduce the book to a new generation of little Mike-Teavees, baiting them with a wizardry that had nothing to envy on Willy Wonka's.The 1971 film was spectacular by the era's standards but there was nothing that could match the sophistication and artistry of the 2000's, when CGI was mastered enough not to be overused. Indeed, CGI only served for scenes that couldn't do without some electronic help, but the rest of the visuals are made of scale-model, meticulously designed set, and even real rivers of chocolate. I saw the film for the first time, I wasn't sure that I would love the characters or the story as much as I love the book, but I knew Tim Burton would push the envelope and delight our eyes. And he did, from the recreation of the Chocolate Factory to the creative impersonation of the Oompas Loompas with diminutive actor Deep Roy and even the contrasts between the first act set in town and all in gray and white with the bright colors of Wonka Land, had some 'Wizard of Oz' vibes except for the Wizard, himself.So, for all its triumphant technology, there's one department where the film didn't live up people's expectation, and it's in the portrayal of Willy Wonka. Granted Wonka is not just the flashy guy with the top hat and the purple redingote, Roald Dahl painted him as a rather dark and mysterious character and the merit of Gene Wilder is that he played your typical cheerful master of ceremony, but that was only a cover and step by step, he unveiled some darker and more sarcastic sides of his personality sarcastic (didn't even inspire one of the most popular Internet memes?). Johnny Depp laid his cards too early and never felt like the kind of fellow who could 'understand' children, not in a creepy way anyway, he struck as a sadistic, sociopath man trying so hard to smile and cheer up his guests. Depp is a fine actor, he played his Wonka very well, but I don't think it was the right angle for the movie, especially when the other characters played their part perfectly.Indeed, I'm not sure I remember any other actors from the 1971 film, except Gene Wilder, Jack Albertson and the blonde-faced Charlie looked weird, but the real star was Wilder, to the point the film was titled after his character. For its own good, the 2005 movie didn't focus too much on Wonka, and one of the many delights was to enjoy the performances of the kids who played the bad ones. The gluttonous Augustus Gloop, Mike teavee with his mean-looking eyes, and the two girls (Julia Winter and AnnaSophia Robb) were perfect Viloet Beauregarde and Veruca Salt, mannerisms, costume design and attitudes with their parents. As for Charlie who's not the most colorful character but rather the pillar and quiet strength of the story, Fredddie Highmore is Charlie like I imagined him. David Kelly also plays an unforgettable Grandpa Joe, I only wish the film didn't overlook some interesting scenes, like their laughing reaction when they don't find the golden ticket, the scene was cut rather abruptly.It's very unsettling that the one role that should've been pivotal to the film's success was the worse, but like Ebert says; the film works despite Depp. A chocolate factory is supposed to be the place any child would love to go, but they'd think twice if they saw that weird dark stranger with the creepy smile. I'm surprised Tim Burton didn't try to adjust Depp's performance because there's something in Burton's work that make him the cinematic heir of Dahl. Both are men who preserved their childhood vision and knew children enough not to patronize them with cute or overly preachy material. They were men of thrills, of adventures and mystery, but there was a heart in their story. And 'Charlie', more than chocolate, is a beautiful story about family and Burton magnificently recreated the loving atmosphere of the Bucket's nest, perhaps the richest family in town if you count love as wealth.And there's a statement about family in the little artistic license he takes by venturing into the backstory of Wonka and his Oedipal issues with his dentist of a father (played by Christopher Lee). But while it was a good idea on the paper, Depp's performance was too unpleasant to make us care for it once the tour was over. So it all comes down to the 1971 having Willy Wonka and 2005 the magic of the book and the casting. Which one I prefer? Well, like I said in the 1971 review the book, naturally.",7,1,2,31 July 2016
The Adjustment Bureau," Entertaining material, but not thought-provoking enough to be even labeled as 'propaganda' ...
","I was surprised by the level of criticism that surrounded 'The Adjustment Bureau'. From what I've read, it seems like the movie was just an excuse for some pro-religious propaganda, underlining the fact that men will never be able to exercise their free will without the supervision of a higher authority, understand God. Frankly, I wish the movie had at least the guts to go as far as what this criticism implies; it would have at least the merit to be quite thought-provoking. What I saw was a well-made special effects driven movie about the power of love and destiny, and a timid cinematic essay about a supernatural force governing our acts, but it takes more than that to be called a propaganda.I have mixed feelings regarding 'The Adjustment Bureau', and I can't exactly put my finger where the movie went in the wrong direction and I know it did at some part. First, I was baffled by the succession of cinematic clichés that were thrown at me. Matt Damon playing David Norris a young political go-getter with a debatable charisma, but I suspended my disbelief for the sake of my enjoyment. Then the bunch of men with funny hats, I wondered if I had to take them seriously, I tried but God it was difficult. But the icing of the cake was the encounter with Elise Sellas, Emily Blunt's character in the men's room. Now, that scene was quite uncomfortable to watch, I hoped, I sincerely hoped they wouldn't be kissing at the end, and  Bingo! I guess Matt Damon is too damn handsome, no girl would resist. And I guess the girl is so beautiful that if she puts your cell phone in a coffee, you'd be laughing you ass because it's just so damn cute. Anyway, to the credit of the film, all the clichés happen in such a short span of time, you still have one hour to give it the benefit of the doubt. And rightfully, as the movie gets more interesting after a awkward start.Nolfi's film, yeah, I had to name the director, goes straight forward, and doesn't embarrass itself with nuances, it reveals right after Damon comes earlier in his office and finds our funny-hatted friends scanning his buddy's memory. He learns that he shouldn't have come earlier and the mission of Harry Mitchell, Anthony Mackie's character, was to spill coffee on Norris so he could miss the bus, come later to the office and certainly not meet the girl. Why? It's all part of a mysterious scheme that I don't want to spoil for you  nah, just kidding. The point was that Norris was destined to become a successful politician, and it's strongly implied that he would be the next President of USA. But there's a 'but', Elise would be an obstacle to his ascension, because she would cover the gaps in Damon's life. And Damon understands that the death of his brother and father, was part of the big 'scheme' that was meant to be the pivotal moment in his decision to become a politician. His mother died too, but that was bad luck, it happens you know.And just to show that the film is very gettable in the first viewing, I also know that Blunt's character was meant to be a great and famous dancer but her romance with Damon wouldn't be helpful for her career. So, why are they so strongly attracted to each other? Because they were the perfect match, and were meant to be together. Well, after all, the 'Big Boss' has the right to change his scheme, who's the Boss for His sake? But now, that we know that Damon meeting Blunt wasn't just an archetypal plot device, but part of the 'Big Plot', we're able to forgive the script. The story moves then into the obliged Damon-esque cat-and-mouse thriller. His objective, getting Elise, even under the threat of a lobotomy. These guys mean business, especially when the file was transferred to Terence Stamp's character. But Damon conveniently finds help in Mitchell who initiates him to the teleportation power of the hats, that can open any door if you turn the knob to the right.Why right? Why the hats? Why not? Everything works for pure script convenience, have we been so interrogative with the treatment of Damon's family background story. No, we're just ought to believe him, so let's not be too technical. At that point, the film becomes a romantic tribute to the power of love where Damon decides to exercise his free will and takes a consenting Blunt with him. Aren't they lovely? The cat-and-mouse chase end up in the top of the building where they're surrounded by the baddies who're not here for kidding, you better believe it. At that point, I was wondering how the script would have concluded after this culmination. Well, since everything is part of the scheme written by a God-like figure, we have one of the most blatant but surprisingly satisfying dues ex machine in a film. Basically, David and Elise proved their love and touched God so much that he decided that finally they were indeed a perfect match. You would think that God has more serious stuff to handle, considering the situation in the world, no, he had to fix this Norris-Sellas issue. After all, maybe a Nuclear Holocaust had just been avoided, who knows?The movie ends with a beautiful speech about our free will, and our capability to determine our choices and responsibility in life just as if the movie was some kind of existentialist masterpiece. Well, it made me question many things about the possibilities of life, and what would I have been if I did this or that in the past, or what would have the movie been if it had been more thought provoking in the script and less lazy in the writing department. Entertaining fun, but nothing else .",7,1,3,2 July 2011
A Bug's Life," What's bugging bugs...
","You know the fable from Aesopus (or La Fontaine) with 'The Ant and the Grasshopper', the ant works the whole summer gathering food for winter while the grasshopper idly sings and enjoys the sun and when winter comes, he realizes, a bit too late, that Karma is a bitch, and so is the ant. Loosely (very loosely) translated into Disney language, the grasshopper becomes the villain who forces the ant to offer him food for winter in exchange of 'protection' from termites or bigger ants. But the story must sustain the movie format, let's make it a colony of ants versus a gang of greedy grasshoppers, and then work on a script à la 'Three Amigos' and you get 'A Bug's Life', Pixar's second film.So, if 'Toy Story' was to 3D what 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' was to traditional animation, well I guess that makes 'A Bug's Life' a little bit like 'Pinocchio', at least as far as chronology and technological improvement go, this comparison is valid, but while 'A Bug's Life' didn't hold up as well as 'Toy Story' 18 years, for the film's defense, it has nothing to do with quality. Indeed, this is a marvel of animation and entertainment and the technological accomplishment it represents says a lot about the progresses made in three years.Drawing toys is one thing and I said about 'Toy Story' that it had the merit to put the setting in a very cozy and familiar environment instead of the usual forests and castles. In 'A Bug's Life', we go back to the forests, but on a smaller, smaller scale and the level of detail is so phenomenal, each frame must have required a lot of hours of works and remember there are 24 frames per second, and many frames contains dozens of character, because, hey, they're insects, small creatures.'A Bug's Life' is the result of thousands and thousands of hard working and the animators deserve all the credit for not having surrendered to the 'easy way', during the mass scenes, I closely looked at the ants in the background, you never have the feeling of a block or repetitive shots, and from what the trivia said, they used a computer program that would animate several group of ants randomly placed in each part of the screen, and it contributes to convey a realistic mass effect. And that's how we imagine ants.Of course, the film is not just about ants but is a tribute to that underworld (literally) that inspires a constant fascination and revulsion. I hate insects but for some reason, I'm fascinated by documentaries about them as if the best way to finally look at the forms, the shapes, the colors, the interactions with other insects or the outside world or fights is to make sure they're not here. Not that 'A Bug's Life' has a documentary-like value like the great 'Microcosmos' but even on a documentary, I would have had a hard time enjoying the sight of cockroaches or grasshoppers. In 'A Bug's Life', insects are cool to watch, and from their standpoints, rain doesn't play a salvation role anymore and cute birds are like scary monsters, time have changed since 'Bambi'.But if 'A Bug's Life' had everything to please the eyes, and to entertain, so why don't we celebrate it like 'Toy Story''? I guess it was released too soon without having the privilege of a sequel younger audiences could appreciate, it's hard to carry a reputation when you're made just between 'Toy Story' and 'Shrek'. And it's all justice that 'Antz' suffers from the same fate, the two films, from rival studios were released the same year, and it's obvious there was some leak, but let's accept as a happy ending that they didn't go to court (although it did terminate some friendships) and that both did well at the box-office but I think I would paraphrase the Emperor Joseph's quote by saying 'there were too many characters' and I'm not saying that was the problem within the story, but about its appeal.Take the ants, they are a colony where each one has a role to play, some carry the food, some guide them etc. they can't think of individuals, except for the queen, her heiress, princess Atta (Julia-Louis Dreyfus) and her sister Dot (young Hayden Pannetiere) but apart from this podium, all ants are just ants, the one who emerges from the mass is Flik, the outcast inventor who always fail (one of his last inventions will cause the destruction of the offering for the grasshoppers, forcing them to prepare food again hence depriving themselves from winter food). Flik is an individual yet the story can't allow us to root for one individual, they're insects and they all work as group, even the mercenaries he's supposed to hire, in reality circus workers covering different personalities, there is not one to stand above.The film is a triumph in characterization and high-scale animation, but take all the movies that succeeded after 'Shrek', 'Finding Nemo', 'Monsters & Co', there was a core of significant characters, Shrek and Fiona, Woody and Buzz, the more you identify with one, the more positively you respond to the spectacle. In 'A Bug's Life', we do empathize with the ants as a whole, but it's hard to feel any stronger toward them. You admire the artistic design, the set of colors, the little jokes here and there, but the only real lesson is that there is strength in unity, but this is a message you can respond to in a war or a sport movie and even then you have the main protagonist.Animation is a world of magic and dream, to be enjoyed in a more individual way, where you can hook your heart on one person. 'A Bug's Life' should have been called 'Bugs' Lives', it's great animation but not necessarily a great film.",7,1,1,14 August 2016
Rudy," Size does matter... if we're speaking of the heart!
","There was a man who once said 'I want to be Chateaubriand or nothing'. His name was Victor Hugo. Yes, even the great Hugo was a wannabe. We all want to be something, someone we idolize, a part of a dream we treasure. Yes, it all starts with a dream and I know it's a cliché, and it's been so trendy to invite everyone to believe in their dreams, that you wonder whether the real deal wouldn't be to set your mind up for realistic anticipations of the future and just try to live a 'nice' and 'happy' life. If only it could be that easy.I guess I had the wrong idea about 'Rudy', I thought it was going to be one of these 'feel-good' underdog stories, like a 'Rocky' of the 90's (even the titles sound the same). I also thought it was going to overplay the height issue as a serious handicap to play football (well American football is not the football as we call it here... the one that allows pint-sized Leo Messi to be the best player in the world). So yes, I thought it was going to be an inspirational movie about a guy who -you know- believed in himself and achieved his dreams. Well, it was... but it was more than that. It doesn't take an underdog to make a good story, it still takes a good story and an endearing character.And 'Rudy', from 'Hoosiers' director David Anspaugh, doesn't just meet with your expectations, it challenges them in a very subtle and intelligent way, one that can be summed up in one sentence: 'Dreams are what make our lives tolerable'. I can't tell who said that and when, but the line was immediately printed in my mind. Yet the film isn't about dreaming. It isn't even about fulfilling your dreams, it's about the will, the decision, the spirit, the energy and ultimately, the journey. The dream in itself is crazy but is handled in a realistic way (the film is based on Rudy Ruettiger's true story) it's not about a small guy who wants to be the star of Notre Dame football team, but who wants to play at least one game. And personally, I prefer dreams that start with 'I wish if I could only one time' rather than 'I want to be this or that'.'Rocky' wasn't about becoming the heavyweight champion but about going the distance, and in 'Rudy' Sean Astin gives an extraordinary performance, as Oscar worthy of a nomination as was Sly in 1977, like Rocky, he's not just an underdog in the game, but in his own family or circle of friends where his dreams are swept off by the brush of reality, except for one true friend who believes in him (like others will do). After finishing college, Rudy almost renounces and joins his Dad (Ned Beatty) and brothers in the steel mill, until a tragic event 'derails' his path of life for good. No need to spoil it.Paraphrasing Hugo, Rudy wants to be a 'Fighting Irish at least once or nothing' and the whole film is a harrowing odyssey where we follow each step that gets him closer to his dream: getting the sponsors, having good grades in prep school, joining Notre Dame, then the practice team... but said like this, it doesn't do justice to how exhilarating it is, when Rudy's happy, we share his joy when he's disappointed, we share his bitterness and when he cries, we shed a few tears. In fact, there's something communicative about Rudy's energy, just see how slowly the magic operates and some start to believe he's got the heart of a true fighter, if not the body. Look at how the players get progressively impressed by his fearless energy. Yet it's still about the journey, the realization, sometimes you dream of reaching the top of the mountain, and maybe you can't make it. But instead of staring at the unreachable summit, the film invites you to look down and contemplate the beautiful landscape and see what you've done. Of course, some climbers fall and there's a poignant scene where Ned Beatty tells his son the story of his grandfather who lost everything because he chased a stupid dream. And over the course of his journey, even Rudy himself thought of quitting... and it made me think.Then I realized that the moment where Rudy was in the game, the film could have stopped right there. I didn't care if he'd win or get an ankle broken, he had just made it. And the film could have even ended right after what I think was the best 'pep talk' ever, one from Fortune the groundskeeper (Charles S. Dutton), his speech wasn't about 'getting hit and keeping moving' but about valuing the hits and the movement. I guess what the film tries to say is that there's a thin line between dreaming and chasing a dream. Dreaming is nothing if you don't start to chase the dream.Because when there's something that eats you deep inside, you know you just got to chase it. Because for a dream-chaser (I didn't say dreamer) there's nothing worse than stopping. When you stop, you settle down, you feel safe and secure... for a while. You start noticing other dream-chasers and you pity them because you know most of them won't make it. And it's true. But that also means a minority will make it. And when you'll see people achieving YOUR dreams, you're going to hate and pity yourself, and Rudy's brother for most of the film is consumed by envy and self-pity. Lennon said 'Life is what happens while you're making plans', maybe the real delight of life is the stuff that happens in order to make your plans go true, even a tiny bit true. On that level, Rudy was quite a delightful film... and to use an overused expression, they don't make like them anymore.",8,0,1,16 May 2018
Big Fish," Not Just the Facts, M'am...
","'Big Fish' tells a story about a man who tells stories. I think we can do better. It's about an ordinary man telling extraordinary stories, thus being extraordinary by proxy. His name is Edward Bloom, a man who spent most of his life inventing tales about how he met his wife, how he proposed her, how he built his house etc. In fact, all the 'who', the 'what' and the 'why' that cover the chapters of his life seem to drain their inspiration from tall tales and fantasy. It gives a man a certain charm, he's like an old grandfather whose rambling is easily forgiven, but the film presents him from the standpoint of his son Will (Billy Crudup) and he doesn't exactly share this view.It's understandable because we've only met Edward (Albert Finney) for five minutes and he just told us a nice little story about a giant catfish he caught with his wedding ring, but the son heard it a thousands times, so much he can recite it, even tell it better than him. Will has had enough and can't stand the fact that his father would steal his thunder, the very day of his wedding, and to babble the same old story, over and over again. There starts a shift of three years, until he learns that Edward's at the verge of death, so he travels from France with his pregnant wife Josephine (Marion Cotillard), convinced that it's time to settle that old record. Will might not be likable but we kind of understand his troubles, it's not about the stories but what they hide. Maybe Will hates his father's stories like people hated Ed Wood's films but Tim Burton, wizard of imagery and at times, storytelling, can turn any lousy premise into a beautiful and emotional experience. Maybe that's what Edward meant by sugarcoating or reinventing the things of the past. I'll make a chronological leap: near the end of the movie, Will hears the real story about his birth, and it's certainly less colorful and memorable than the way Edward Sr. described. it had the merit to be the truth. Will obviously loves his father but blames him for his incapability to make a distinction between what is true and what is not. Burton doesn't allow us to make the distinction either because the point is elsewhere, the frustration of the son is duly noted, but the trick is to lead him to reconsider his personal frustrations.The movie, through regular flashbacks, enlightens us about the life and times of Edward Bloom, his younger self, played by Ewan McGregor. The story is obviously exaggerated, we don't really care because within the framework of the film, it's the only story we'll take for granted, especially since Will won't get many real 'versions' apart from his birth. The film's premise is a real paradox, we know we don't follow Edward's story but his personal vision, from our perspective, it's 'his' story because he's the storyteller.We're basically torn between the anger of the son who only wants to know what kind of a man his father was and our personal enjoyment that doesn't necessarily seek any truth, unless we would care for Will. Obviously, Roger Ebert cared enough for Will so he was genuinely annoyed by the father and his wrestling with the truth, but Ebert must have been in a wrong day, because the point of the film is obviously to make us relate to Edward and accept our liberty to look at our lives with the narrative we chose. It's Burton's vision as it's Edward's, there are times though where Burton gets carried away by his usual tropes, the colorful suburban small town like in 'Edward Scissorhands', the many encounters on which the hero's journey depends, a gentle giant, a circus ringmaster, Siamese twins, a witch, all played by endearing actors like Danny De Vito, Steve Buscemi,and Helena Bonham Carter, but there is something that remains oddly consistent: these lies have a purpose, they represent the way a man looks at his life, he manipulate the facts because he knows these facts will die with him, while stories will contribute to his own myth.That's the key, that's the purpose of that ending where Will literally says 'the hell with it', swallows his pride and 'take' his father to a last farewell ride. The emotionals raised at that moment has something that borrows from Spielberg's movies but it works because it finds the right touch, the son doesn't reinvent a story or make up an adventure from the scratch, he just takes his father to a last trip where he meets and says goodbye to all the people who populated his life and turns into that 'big fish' he always mentioned in that ring story. This is not the son 'understanding' his father, Edward will always be a mystery, but it's the son loving his father enough to at least be part of the last thing that defined him, and maybe understanding him a little.As a son, and also as a father, I could strongly emotionally relate to the film, because like I say sometimes, it's not about love and respect but understanding. So, on the surface, 'Big Fish' is a colorful and visually entertaining picaresque journey of a man who found his destiny the oddest way, who told stories about his life and made it his reason to be, but beneath the surface, it's a poignant father-and-son story where the outcome is two persons finally coming to terms. The film doesn't overplay the emotions and the visual delights and there's a simplicity in the story you want to fully embrace as if the right attitude was from the wives played by Jessica Lange and Cotillard, let the old fool have his dreams, and be fool enough to enjoy them. Isn't that what Cinema, or life, or everything about, suspension of disbelief.",8,1,1,21 June 2017
The Insider," The toughest battles are always internal...
","It's interesting that, on several occasions, 'The Insider' insists on the fact that it was a dramatization and at times fictionalization of real-life events as if the makers decided to adopt the characters' honesty and transparency. It's all to the credit of Eric Roth and Michael Mann who respectively wrote and directed a powerful drama about men caught in professional and ethical dilemmas, but ultimately, making the right choice. Still, this is a long road to these 'right choices', paved with seemingly insurmountable obstacles -the worst being internal- and depicted through a claustrophobic and moody thriller.For the thrills, 'The Insider' relies on a heavy editing, an abundance of phone calls between angry protagonists, a succession of threats and volte-faces, of confused hesitations and divisive decisions, the overall effect is dizzying and upsetting, there are many reliefs where the characters can question their choices but it's only at the end that we can finally breath. And as inspirational as the message is, we're also glad that this exhaustive journey has finally ended. There's no cheers, no arms raised, no champagne popping, no exchange of smiles, there's a feeling of sheer loneliness that inhabit all the players of this influence-wrestling game between tobacco companies and the fourth estate as if one couldn't lead a collective crusade without condemning himself to an individual exile.It doesn't work for every movie but in the case of 'The Insider', Michael Mann managed to inject a sense of existentialism in this quest for truth, that's not a matter of opinion that what the tobacco company did was wrong on every level, and even a smoker wouldn't deny it, but how about having the courage to denounce it? That's the whole point of whistle blowing, and the ungrateful burden rests on the shoulders on chemist Dr. Jeffrey Wygand (Russel Crowe), who meets CBS producer Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino) after he's just lost his job. The meeting is purely coincidental but once Bergman understands that Wygand is under a contract of confidentiality, his instinct tells him that something doesn't smell good about the tobacco industry, and it's not just tobacco.Wygand is a man of probity, and never is this certitude shaken to pretend to mislead us, even when the adverse parties try to sabotage his image. What the film shows though is that he's a man of responsibility. If he speaks, he loses all his severance benefits and will be sued, not to mention the psychological effect of death threats and the growing discouragement of his wife (Renee Olstead). The marital element is crucial because there's no attempt of understanding what her husband is going through, all she sees is that they will lose the house, the ones where their daughters made their first steps, their privileges, their comfort, everything they built. From the moment, Wygand embarks in this battle, it's like an earthquake menacing the foundations of their marriage, and it's a matter of time before the inevitable. The tragedy is also on a private level.And Russell Crowe plays Wygand in such a way that we can relate to him, a man who's caught in a worse fight than one on the battlefield because it's permanent and affects his life on a daily basis. Take the trigger of his decision to accept the interview with CBS, only when he's threatened in a patronizing way by his former bosses, he accepts CBS' deal. His ego is tickled, he makes the right choice for the wrong reasons, but it's still right in the sense that it will then throw the 'hot potato' to the journalist and confront them to their own ethical hypocrisy, when CBS is confronted to the legal intricacies that would force them to pay one hell of a bill if they ever interfere between a company and a worker. There comes a point where everyone must make a choice and pay the price.Mike Wallace, one of the most enduring and respected correspondents of the CBS '60 Minutes' program, played by Christopher Plummer, uses all available means and his power to get the interview done, he's a man who interviewed tyrants and politicians, but he can taste the sour irony when the 'seven dwarfs' of the third major tobacco company are preventing him from doing his job and forcing him to surrender to the cause of money. While he does play in the same team than Bergman, he's powerless when the real threat comes from 'inside', quite fitting, given the film's title. Publishing the interview might ruin the channel's deal with Westinghouse, which represents a great opportunity of financial expansion. And now, the journalists are entrapped in the same dilemma. Bergman couldn't understand Wygand, until the end.The merit of 'The Insider' is to highlight the truth that there's not one courageous step that doesn't have a price.And while the film is driven by the whole chronicles of fact and investigation procedures, it really gets into an unexpected level of poignancy when the main players are confronted to their failures, ignoring that they are temporary. When Wygand learns that the airing is canceled, his reaction is pleasantly surprising, by that time, he's divorced and he's alone, but what he deplores is that his daughters will never know why their lives had taken such a dramatic change, to realize that it was worth it. And Wallace has a powerful exchange with Bergman, aware that infamy lasts longer than glory, and that this failure might ruin his legacy, because what he did was betraying the legacy of Edward Murrow, and since I recently saw 'Good Night, and Good Luck', I could appreciate the comparison.Truth ultimately triumphed and yes, it was all worth it, but it was an omelet that broke many eggs, and many spirits, but it's a triumph nonetheless and Wygand, Bergman and Wallaces' legacies wouldn't suffer from it otherwise, there wouldn't be a movie like 'The Insider'.",9,1,1,25 February 2017
Quiz Show," Bread, Wine and Circuses ... Sandwiches, Geritol and TV Quiz Shows ...
","The 50's had 'A Face in the Crowd', the 70's 'Network', and the 90's 'Quiz Show', and as usual, TV-themed films carry the same premise of entertainment as their inspiration, with the same degree of cynicism. We never know as a viewer if we're accomplices or victims, it's up to us to take positions and to decide if the big TV star is one to root for or not. More than a plot device, this helps to engage us into the diabolical mechanisms that sometimes govern the modern Pandora box we -for the majority of us- grew up with.Antoine de Saint-Exupery said that 'Love does not consist in gazing at each other, but in looking outward together in the same direction'. This sentence almost defines the very essence of TV. There's just something so fascinating in this little box, that converges the sights of millions of people from all the country, there's an odd equation between being on TV and being loved, as if the magnetic waves emitted by the screen filled the people's heart with a curious desire to be inside, this envy is translated into love, from the pride to know or to be close to the TV star. The producers got it right, audience wanted ordinary people to become stars, and when you have no talent in sports, or arts, the only weapon left for the schmuck is the intellect.'Revenge of the Nerds' can be a fitting subtitle for TV Quiz Shows, and the movie opens with the unlikeliest TV star, John Turturro as a man with a 'face for radio', the champion of the 'Twenty One', Herbert Stempel, a Jewish New Yorker at the pinnacle of his winning streak. But the lowering ratings aren't enough to compensate the awkwardness of Stempel and the feeling that the audience wants something new gets more and more palpable. So basically the idea consists on changing the nerdie as to change a light-bulb. And in the case of Charles Van Doren, the crooked producers, Freedman and Enright, Hank Azaria and David Paymer found the mother lode. The casting of Ralph Fiennes is perfect, his juvenile smile, rosy cheeks; exude a perfume of innocence while his voice maintain a serious dignity. Fiennes as Van Doren is so appealing that it makes his decision to sell his soul even more tragic for him, and difficult for us to accept.What would you do for TV, for fame, for money, for love? The film asks many questions in which silence can be the only non hypocritical answer. I won't extend the analysis to actual TV programs when any means justified to keep up the ratings, where at least the 50's had the decency to promote some intellectuality while today, muscles and tits replaced the brains. It could fill a whole thesis, and we already know that the majors and the sponsors always win. To make it short, let's say that the majors's cynical purpose is to sell some available brain time for the sponsors, and so-called entertainment is the hypnotic eye to let the viewer know that Geritol, is the best tonic in the world, to believe whatever they want, and the worst stuff doesn't necessarily concern the advertising department. TV got away with the scandal and this is precisely why I prefer to analyze the human aspect of the film.'Quiz Show' is a powerful drama about the consequences of adults behaving like children, it's about dilemmas and responsibilities. Behaving like children is having everything you dreamed of, without earning it, and living in the illusion that it will last, as in the denial of the existence of justice. But justice is here, and it's incarnated by the young Congressman lawyer from Harvard, Dick Goodwyn, played by Rob Morrow, the one who smelled something fishy at the first place. I thought in the beginning that the fact that he was Jewish was irrelevant, but actually, it helped him to have more affinity with Stempel who kind of convinced him that the WASP pretty boy winning over the geeky Jewish boy is not a legend, and with Van Doren on which he developed a real fondness and a profound admiration, falling himself in the trap of a childish attitude, in the sense of unprofessional.The characterization in 'Quiz Show' is tactfully handled by Robert Redford's masterful direction. Stempel is more than a comic relief, he plays the victim with the tender flamboyance of the schmuck who still got his pride. Goodwyn is also weakened by his own affection to Van Doren, a corrupted soul whose only redeeming quality is to have inspired this friendship and more than anything, the love of his father, Mark Van Doren, the poet and the intellectual. Paul Scofield steals the movie with a nuanced but remarkable performance, as a man so convinced of the inner integrity of his son, we can't help but feel angry toward the son who broke such a noble heart. The Van Doren's tragedy is incarnated by two consecutive moments, the avalanche of applauds addressing the Committee member who wasn't fooled by Van Doren's eloquent speech, and the part that almost brought a tear to my eye, the devastation of the parents who learned that their son won't be a professor and that the 'name' of the Van Dorens was tarnished or in the best case, would be forever associated to a sordid affair.Truth triumphed, Stempel convinced that he knew the answers he pretended to ignore, the scheme was revealed, but TV got away with it, that's the show business  even Stempel felt some empathy to Van Doren, as both ultimate victims of the media, a cruel arena condemning you to be eaten by the lions, the journalists and the movie ends with smiling faces representing the audiences as the Romans who cheered for the gladiators before condemning them",10,1,2,1 August 2011
The Dark Knight," When the greatest figure is disfigured... and the mastermind is out of his...
","I stupidly avoided 'The Dark Knight' for ten years because it rose on the Top 250 at the expenses of my all-time favorite 'The Godfather'. A ridiculous fans ratings war resulted with 'The Shawshank Redemption' as number one. Another uproar was to start when Heath Ledger's testimonial film failed to garner a nomination for Best Picture, despite being one of the most acclaimed movies of the year, the snub of 'WALL·E' didn't help either. So the Academy expanded the number of nominees to ten, an effort as laughable as laudable, since not many new movies of the caliber of 'The Dark Knight' were made after.That's to establish how pivotal the film was and how much I anticipated it. But I needed to re-watch the first Batman movies. And my ecstatic reaction after 'Batman Begins' convinced me that I had another thing coming with 'The Dark Knight'.Indeed, the film is not just a good sequel but so good it makes you totally forget about it being a sequel. It's a continuation in terms of the narrative but it accomplishes something that a few sequels actually do, not the first anyway: it deconstructs all the values Batman stands for. If his heroic quest brings up the worst possible psychopaths, what good can he be for 'Gotham City'?The film destroys whatever the previous film built up in a sort of constructive chaos, just when you thought that it would 'consolidate' Batman's heroic status, it does the exact opposite. Why? Well, the script has a saying about 'how things working according to a plan' can be as debatable and questionable than so-called chaotic turns of events, so our expectations are contradicted for their own good. And for our fun... if 'fun' can be applied to the film. I think it can. But let's get back to the question of heroism.The film dissects it as if it was some philosophical essay and the answers are provided of course by the two most memorable characters: the Joker (naturally) and Harvey Dent. It's fascinating how Bruce Wayne aka Batman becomes almost a peripheral character but the deeper we get in these two alternative arcs, the more it questions the existence of the iconic vigilante in Gotham City, and the more it does so, the more it justifies its status as one of the most fascinating and iconic comic-book character. It's one hell of a virtuous circle thanks to a remarkably written script and a magnificently executed action-movie. Speaking of the awards, contrarily to its predecessor, it garnered many Oscar nominations and grabbed every possible award for Best Supporting Actor. There's no doubt that today, the Best Picture nomination would have been a lock, but I think the Writing deserved a nod as well, and even Aaron Eckhart is unfairly underrated as 'Two Face', perhaps not as flashy and creepy as the Joker, but as tormented and complex as Wayne. And I love how Nolan doesn't keep on zeroing on Batman, he handles the supporting cast as importantly as the hero, because they might say more about him than he would himself.The film, along with 'Spider-Man II' and 'Iron Man' were said to have revived the popularity of comic-book movies, but I don't know if they are as daring as 'The Dark Knight' in their critical approach to the hero. It seems like today, whoever is in the poster must be admired, glorified, must stand for something immediately deemed as inspirational and empowering. 'The Dark Knight' puts these so-called strength and power into an equation whose resolution is a triumph of intelligence-within-entertainment. Batman becomes a hero in the way he acknowledges that the general public isn't ready for his heroism and would benefit from a hero like Harvey Dent despite this latter having surrendered to the temptation of vileness.But even this vileness isn't your typical 'mua-haha' trope, although it features a lot of it. Like heroism, vileness relies on a state of a mind starting with feeling such as deceptions and resentments, we all have 'scars' behind our smile so to speak. And the Joker isn't much a villain to be defined by what he does, unlike the 'hero', but evil by the way he enlightens us about the darkest abysses of our soul. See, some people can be funny by saying funny things or making points in a funny way. The Joker makes points in an evil way, and that's why he's so mesmerizing, and that's why Heath Ledger's performance is one of a kind.Many things can be said about Ledger but I loved that line from the New York Daily New by Joe Neumaier: 'It says something about the curious nature of film, that someone can be so alive onscreen, when we're all too aware that they've passed away, how we are mortal, and films are immortal.' I guess this is why this film is immortal and why Ledger had left this world with a performance that enriched our lives, featuring a villain who drives not only the action or the (anti)heroes' arcs but becomes a philosophical force whose appeal rises above the movie.Now, I ended the my previous comment about 'Batman Begins' with an unlikely connection with the adventures of Scrooge McDuck, I'll say in the same fashion about 'The Dark Knight' that it reminded me of that 'Simpsons' episode 'Lisa the Iconoclast' when she refused to reveal the truth about Jebediah Springfield saying that the myth has brought up the good in everyone, and that's what Batman and Harvey Dent indirectly stated, and what the extraordinary 'bomb' sequence has illustrated (and God, what a plan!). It also reminded me of that sacrifice of Rocky Sullivan in 'Angels With Dirty faces', one I wouldn't spoil here.Destroying your legacy is perhaps the greatest mark of heroism, when great causes are worth fighting for them... and being fought. Seriously, what can you do when the greatest figure is disfigured and the mastermind out of his?",9,2,2,6 April 2018
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Hogwarts united against the forces of evil... and oppressive bureaucracy?
","Looking back at the first films, I wonder if J.K. Rowling would have expanded the story so generously hadn't she been carried away by the success of the first books and their respective adaptations; probably getting new ideas with -this time- the cast members in mind and so many vehicles for new CGI 'wizardry'. Her 'baby' was undeniably caught in a virtuous circle and the fifth opus 'Order of Phoenix' was no exception.Although this chapter is a bit tougher to follow, it's all to the credit of a writer to be able to amplify such a promising material and make a coming-of-age story over the span of seven books. Naturally, the tone is likely to evolve as the kids approach adulthood and the inevitability of the final confrontation with the forces of evil ('Goblet of Fire' gave us quite a foretaste). So if the enchantment fades away in favor of more sinister plots and subplots, maybe it's only a way for fantasy to echo reality and the loss of innocence induced by the passing of times.Neville (Matthew Lewis) who was the butt of many jokes in the first stories, has nothing remotely comical about him anymore and Drago Malefoy (Tom Felton) goes from the spoiled cowardly brat to a dark young man who won't be played for laughs any longer. By contrast, the least blatant changes come from the leading trio whose evolution followed a more natural pace. And here they are in their fifth year at Hogwarts, which means they're pushing to 15, older than their counterparts but looking young enough to be believable teenagers. Eventually, the only one who's still played for laughs is Cousin Dudley (Harry Melling) shell-shocked after an impromptu visit from the Dementors (an eloquent symbolism as the attack is set in a playground).Yet the tone of this Harry Potter isn't as 'dark' as it seems, only puzzling. After using a magical spell to put the Dementors away, a mail announces he's been expelled from Hogwarts. I didn't decide to give much weight to that because intuitively, I felt it was only a set-up to a denser story. Even the reaction of Uncle Vernon proved that it wasn't intended to carry some gravitas (I have a chuckle just thinking of Richard Griffith's ecstatic grimace, as if he was holding a seizure). Still, that was a perplexing set-up.Indeed, why wouldn't Harry Potter be trusted anymore? Wasn't that an obvious case of self-defense? Wasn't the Ministry of Magic overreacting a little? Why wouldn't they believe that You-Know-Who was back? Not to spoil the previous chapter but how did they think that 'incident' ever happened? Harry's judgment made me question the choices of Rowling to insert some comments against bureaucracy and political corruption in her universe, that's a level of maturity I didn't expect especially since it took time for the main plot to take its full shape.So what strikes in 'Order of Phoenix' is that new loosely structure tone, combined with several new faces and a storyline that demands a lot of patience and has gotten me lost several times. Obviously, the big shots of the Wizard worlds don't trust Voldemort's return and officially appoint Dolores Umbridge as the new teacher of you-know-what, officiously a 'mole' determined to whip everyone in line. While she has the traits of Cinderella's godmother, Imella Staunton plays Umbridge as a combo between Nurse Ratched and a caricature of Margaret Thatcher with the pink outfit of Jackie Kennedy. Maybe too one-dimensional to be an endearing villain, she was a scene-stealing presence.Speaking of the newcomers, there's the unbelievably sexy Natalia Tena Nymphadora Tonks (a name more fitted for a James Bond girl) and Evanna Lynch plays the dreamy blonde Luna Lovegood, a girl who seems to live in her own world and looks strange even by Hogwarts standards. Finally, there's Helena Bonham Carter who makes quite an entrance as the Death Eather cousin of Sirius Black: Bellatrix Lestrange. It's not much the way she looks than what she does in that film that would leave no skepticism about her status as a serious villain. There's a lot to digest in that film, as you can see, but from what I read, the book is the longest of the series, so the task of David Yates was rather Herculean.And it's no wonder the result feels like such a maze of secrets, traps, chases, escapes and revelations, including a great one about Harry Potter's father, giving him more depth and humanity than the eternal sanctification that started from chapter one. One can easily lose his track in the film but I guess the best way to stay focused is just to follow Harry Potter, he IS the touchstone of the series, and never knows more than we do. Perhaps that's the best thing about the series, we know there are events that precede him, a lot of foreshadowing, but as long as we stay with him, answers will come sooner or later, with style or heavy drama.Now of course, Harry's not the round little wizard with eyes getting wide after a successful magical trick, his personality has turned into something fully dimensional and far more complex than many franchise characters... he's not the protagonist of a rich universe, he's a universe by himself and maybe that's why he's often inclined to do the job alone, as if he felt his friends shouldn't venture in the same places than he, as if he had to carry alone the burden of being the 'chosen one'. But 'Order of Phoenix' has this novelty (foreshadowed in the title) that this time, the game gets bigger... so they all work as a team, and not just a trio.It's all about spreading the wealth and the film has the juice of a thrilling adventure movie, the score that goes with it and the climax that redeems a few little flaws.",7,1,1,26 November 2018
Into the Wild," 'Happiness is only real when shared.'
","'Into the Wild' is the inspirational albeit heartbreaking story of a brilliant young man named Christopher McCandless who abandoned the premise of a wealthy existence to follow the footsteps of his hero Jack London and answer the call of the wild. He eventually died of starvation after two years of a journey that ended in Alaska where he spent 110 days in a bus lost in the middle of an ancient mining town named Stampede Trail. The bus is still there with Chris' remaining belongings, his diary and his aura.It's a sad story but not a tragedy. Chris chose his destiny and gave it its full meaning. He didn't know what he was seeking but knew what he was rejecting, believing the journey mattered more than the destination. Such a story called for a movie and of all directors, it was Sean Penn who adapted the book of writer and mountaineer Jon Krakauer, rightfully believing the material would still find a profound echo in people's hearts 15 years after Chris' death. His movie is not only served by a breathtaking cinematography and a haunting performance by Emile Hirsch, it also benefits from a clever editing, ironically the only category to be Oscar-nominated besides Hal Holbrook's supporting performance.The editing matters because one can't look at Chris' odyssey as something linear, the film opens by swinging back and forth between the 'Magic Bus' discovery and family flashbacks, respectively the 'beginning of the end' and 'the end of the beginning'. The non-linear storytelling creates the same startling puzzlement as the people who met Chris the adventurer when they discovered where he came from: a wealthy family with two highly educated parents (William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden) who tried to shape his future with their 'present' as a model. So when we see this young hiker barely accepting a pair of boots before getting in the middle of the wild nowhere, we know something failed in the McCandless' educational project.The contrast is even more striking as Hirsch suffers from the same cruel syndrome than many young men who, beardless, look ten years younger despite the fact that the stories are set only two years apart. So we can see both the plant of rebellion growing and the roots in Chris' past. And Penn chooses the right way to relate the process, Chris couldn't be the narrator, he's a man of action and his actions speak for his rejections: refusing a car as a gift, gives his entire $24,000 savings to charity, burning money, cutting his credit card, everything that superficially defined him.So it's through his sister's monologue that we understand what sowed the seeds of his non-conformist: his father's infidelity, domestic violence and the way his parents' materialistic achievements alienated them from their two children and painted a forever disgraceful portrait of success in the mind of Chris (the sister is played by Jena Malone). So Chris expressed his disagreement many times until it was time to walk the walk. So we can clearly see the initial motives and the end of the journey.And the middle-story is indirectly told by someone who only left behind him a series of encounters with strangers that Krakauer could track in order to reassemble the pieces of the puzzle. Chris didn't write anything until he came to the bus because it represented the edge of his adventure, the real challenge he was seeking. During the last two years where he was still looking for himself, he met a couple of hippies (Brian Dierker and Catherine Keener) a farmer (Vince Vaughn), a couple of Danish tourists and finally Hal Holbrook as Ron Franz.In every case, something immediately caught their hearts, they shaped his vision but so he did with his genuine sincerity, brave approach to life and optimism. And though Hirsch gave a great performance, bizarrely snubbed, the real Chris looked even more sympathetic.Speaking from experience, I had my share of friends in business school who were acting like pseudo rebels, rejecting the comfort of modernity, career, family and wealth, only to get back in the ranks once the diploma obtained. Young privileged ones like Chris are numerous but a few of them dare to act according to their thoughts and that's why Chris immediately cuts to our hearts, he's a man of his word. And go figure why, I was thinking of Anne Frank while finishing the film. Maybe it's because I saw the film recently but here are the points of comparisons.Both died in their youth and became universal symbols of a spirit resisting the pressure of the world and seeking honesty, purity and peace. Both had a diary they couldn't finish. Both depended on the kindness of people and it's a real shame for Franz who couldn't adopt Chris (Holbrook melted my heart in his last scene). Finally, both have universal posthumous legacies and we can only picture them with a smile on their faces. Of course, Anne didn't chose her life but she lived tragedy with her family while Chris lived happiness he couldn't share.Happiness indeed. Chris' last picture shows him with a smile on his face, looking gaunt like a Concentration Camp survivor but smiling nonetheless. He didn't want to die, he might have expected it when he realized he couldn't get back anywhere and never let enough hints to be found, but his survival journey into the wild made him a model for young people who felt an instant need to discover themselves while discovering the world.Chris could learn a few things before getting back and coming to terms with his family but he didn't have time to practice what he learned. Still, what he lived taught the world a lesson, a practical one about survival, a universal one about being true to yourself and a timeless one about dreams and happiness, achieving dreams is important but dreaming alone can be dangerous, if not lethal.",9,3,6,9 February 2019
Annie Hall," Allen's Strange Love, or How I Learned to Stop Whining and Love the Film ...
","You know this awkward and uncomfortable feeling when you just finished a joke and yet everyone looks like waiting for the punch line, inviting for a humiliating 'That's it' that tolls the bell of a benign but painful failure? Well, my worst memory comes from a joke that I swore I would never speak about again, but let's exorcise the inner demons behind the mask of anonymity. There's a guy who comes to his friend and tells him 'I have two news for you' His friend says 'Well, start with the bad news' to which the other replies: 'They're both bad news'This summarizes the first feeling I had with Woody Allen's most acclaimed and praised film, 'Annie Hall', the movie still famous, or infamous, depends on the POV, for having beaten the much more spectacular, groundbreaking and popular 'Star Wars' in the Best Picture Oscar competition.I was not the Woody Allen fan I happen to be now; I was totally unfamiliar with his 80's and 90's work and probably more compliment-oriented towards his slapstick period. I expected from 'Annie Hall' a romantic comedy between the eternally neurotic Woody character and a sort of hip and free-spirited woman played by Diane Keaton and named Annie Hall. Well, I wasn't disappointed on that level, but while I wanted to see a movie really worthy of a Best Picture Oscar, something that would provide a nice mix of wit and emotions, I could only see a pretentious ego-centered movie with no point, no structure, no appeal, the movie left me with a very flat feeling, and God knows how I've always hated flatness. So indeed, 'they were both bad news.'But I guess I was victim of the 'Illusory Time' concept. You know what the illusory time concept is? It's this revolutionary idea that time doesn't exist, not quite the way we interpret it as a reality conditioned by the existence of a past, a present, a future but more the combination of the three into one perpetual present. This theory relies on the universe's inner property: its expansion. And while you can define a point on Earth by three spatial and one temporal coordinates, if you take a more universal approach, you realize that the three spatial dimensions will never be static considering the expansion of the universe. In other words, we're never in the same point. This doesn't really make me feel as anxious as young Alvy Singer, but this explains why I disliked Allen's 'Annie Hall'.When you take 'Annie Hall' as a whole, no pun intended, it's just a movie about a guy who thinks himself as the center of this expanding universe and analyzes the world from his own perspective, he pompously and pretentiously expresses a cynicism disguised in wit to better hide his own self-loathing nature. At the end, it's all about talking and talking, it's a succession of good lines, of creative plot devices, something was lacking, but I couldn't point my finger what and where. I didn't really dislike 'Annie Hall' but I disliked the fact that it was Allen's most popular film, the winner of the Best Picture Oscar, and I hated the fact that I couldn't get why this movie was great, what makes it such a gem. I almost wished I could have the real Allen with me to tell me what was so great about it.Three years have gone, I've seen almost all Allen's films, he became one of my favorite directors, I gained some cinematic maturity, and before I could watch 'Annie Hall' again, I could at least put it in a chronological map in both Allen's filmography and History of Cinema. 'Annie Hall' is the cinematic transition between Allen's slapstick period and his glorious streak of unique and creative films with autobiographical undertones that would reach its pinnacle in the 80's. It plays exactly like 'City Lights' for Charlie Chaplin, the time we discover a character we're familiar with, involved in a more mature material, but never losing his appeal. It's not drama Woody, or romantic Woody, it's the same neurotic Woody with something new, that would defines his future work. Dr. Woody and Mr. Allen.'Annie Hall''s year of release is also significant because it coincides with the new era of blockbusters that would put an end to the extraordinary New Hollywood wave, in a way, the story of Alvy Singer and Annie Hall, the beautiful singer, is the swan song of a form of artistic expression that can only pass for pretension because, now, we, modern or younger movie viewers are more familiar with characters who never display hints of intellectual superiority toward their audience, not in romantic comedies anyway. Would we ever have characters talking about stuff we don't know about, even if it's made to sound sophisticated and pretentious, like Freud, McLuhan or Swedish Cinema. Never, even Harry and Sally were discussing about 'Casablanca' a much more approachable movie. I guess we blame Allen for being so indulgent because he can't make us feel indulgent toward his characters. But this is the gutsy aspect of 'Annie Hall' and the contributor of its unique appeal.So, as a movie to enjoy on the present, 'Annie Hall' is tricky, but if you have enough patience to let the film grow on you, it reaches the level of a valuable gem, and its victory over 'Star Wars' is only the last agonizing breath before Cinema d'Auteur could take a big dive. And I hope you won't knock the previous intellectual masturbation about the universe, thank you.There was a joke I've always liked, about a little boy asking his father 'Dad, are we in America yet?' to which his dad says 'Just shut up and keep on swimming' Well, I guess this sums up my new feeling of 'Annie Hall', its greatness is probably like this America, and I guess right now, I'm starting to see the coast.",10,0,0,5 November 2011
2001: A Space Odyssey," An intelligent masterpiece, victim of its own greatness ...
","2001 is the perfect example of a movie I wanted -as a movie fan- to love but I couldn't, I didn't hate it either and I still consider HAL-9000's part as one of the most thrilling sequences from any Sci-Fi film.A strange feeling inhabits me when I watch this film, I feel so alone that it's like it tunnels me into the deepest side of my soul, which is my innate condition as a mortal and my instinctive fear of death. The death scene in this movie is the greatest depiction of whatever death would look like, a hypnotically scary immensity of nothingness, that's what space is all about : death. 2001 is a movie about space, space as death, death as loneliness, and loneliness as our Human Condition.There's no eating, no feeling, no loving, no caring in this films, even the 'little girl' sequence seems so 'badly done', I mean unlike Kubrick's usual work, these things that are so important for us, poor mortal souls, seem so futile and pointless in 2001, because space is death. But space is also synonym of escape and quest, quest for immortality by escaping our human condition, it's like the key of 'immortality' is our dehumanization, a dream impossible to reach, because the alternative of our mortality isn't depicted as being a machine, but being a God-like figure, like Dave, when he was 'terminating' Hal-9000.God created men in his own image like men created HAL, the most intelligent creature/creation after man, but HAL exploited his own intelligence to kill his own creator, like men use their powers to kill God by killing the spirit of God that lives in their hearts, the spirit of God being the emotions, the feelings, love, compassion, everything that separate us from animals. I've always considered the relationship between Dave and HAL as an allegory of our humanity, and that's what makes the movie so depressing and pessimistic, our humanity is characterized by our intelligence, a double-edged sword, and our feelings so useless (in Dave's situation) when compared to the cold and monolithic death, this duality, feelings and intelligence is what makes things happen whereas death is nothing but nothingness and immobility, and unfortunately, it's the only certitude (even the existence of God is debatable)The movie is an invitation to contemplate a death-like world that would strongly remind us of our human condition, it's a quest for an unreachable immortality, because as powerful as we are, we can't become God, like HAL failed to become the only Master of the Vessel, becoming a machine is renouncing to our feelings, which is the key for self-destruction and annihilation of the humanity, and feelings are as useless as a drop of water in the desert of fate, Dave lived a long time but ultimately died. But as useless as feelings are and as dangerous as intelligence is, they're our most precious assets, what characterizes us the most as human, we can't become God, we can't become machines, we're only humans and our future is nothing less than our origins, our quest for immortality lead us to reconsider our conditions as mortal, but also highlights our miraculous condition as living creatures, life is a miracle, death implies life and vice versa, the beautiful shot of the fetus at the end invites us to forget about our individual death but think of us as an 'immortal' species, as an extraordinary civilization that reached immortality through intelligence combined with feelings : culture, ideas, arts, creations, beauty and Universality. The key of Immortality is Universality, to think of ourselves as humans, not as individuals since the Creator is the only immortal individuality, we can become God-like only as a collectivity, as the Humanity, Creator of its own Civilization.The movie is a masterpiece, one of the most intelligent and probably the most universal films ever made, (why intelligent? because it makes so many points with a few dialogs and action) but it is victim of its own greatness because Kubrick couldn't make his point in a different way, he's a great director and found the right tone, and the perfect visuals ... that's why I felt bored so many times, Death is a hypnotically scary immensity of nothingness, the movie had a hypnotic beauty, was thrilling and scary during the HAL's sequence, was immense by its dimension, beauty and philosophical value and many times, there was just emptiness, nothing special happened, because that's the way it is, sometimes, nothing DOES happen and in death, nothing will ever happen. The point of the movie, was its strength and its strength was its weakness. There are so many beautiful shots in this film, so many stunning sequences, an incredible score, but it was impossible for the movie to be so universally intelligent and entertaining in the same time.The Beauty of 2001 is like men's intelligence, a double edged sword, and its genius is as unreachable as immortality... all I can say is that I 'get' it, but I can't get it.",8,2,5,4 October 2010
Toy Story," A Three-Dimensional Masterpiece with a Special Effect in our Hearts :
","Almost 20 years have passed since the nineties Â… Now, we are so familiar with the cell- phones, Facebook and the Internet that we're totally amnesic regarding these years where we had none, and we all scratch our heads wondering how communication was even possible back then. Not too surprisingly, the same reasoning can be applied for animation: we're so used to CGI and 3D animated films that we forgot how groundbreaking Walt Disney's 'Toy Story' was in 1995, and that we witnessed an event as historical as the release of 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'. It's not surprising, by the way, that the two films are the only animated features included in the American Film Institute's Top 100 List.The comparison with 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' doesn't only rely on the technical achievement and the critical recognition, but also on what drove these two crucial aspects: an endearing and universally appealing story. 'Snow White' exploited all the comical possibilities of the dwarfs, in order to use physically distinct characters with different personalities attributed to each of them, while the Queen and Snow White could be modeled in more realistic designs; the setting also allowed the drawers to extend their talents and give it the touch of magic and escapism the audiences needed back then. 'Toy Story' does the exact same thing, it chooses the best setting that can justify a clever and playful use of three-dimensionality, by creating a sort of underworld made of different forms and colors, a world where toys come to life when the owner is absent. This choice is a strike of genius because it provides an escapist value in our own environment, Disney made enough movies set in forests, mountains, jungles, so for its first 3D film, we have the first in-door Disney film, which gives an irresistible feeling of intimacy.This simplicity is the perfect counterpart to the complexity of special effects and the creativity of the screenplay because it also succeeds to add a little touch of nostalgia and hit a sensitive chord by waking the inner child inside of us. In 1995, we're in the midst of Disney Renaissance and its streak of successful films was so full of adventures and romance, thrills and laughs that 'Toy Story' almost resonates as a comeback to the roots of the Walt Disney Company, childhood. Haven't we all played with toys when we were kids, whether they were dolls, Smurfs figurines, cars, monsters, haven't we all used our hands, totally invisible for our little eyes, and talked instead of characters, like magical puppeteers, imagining them sliding from a ravine that was our bathtub, or escalating a mountain, the bed-pillow. Toys were always alive for us, because our games were precisely what brought them to life, and in 'Toy Story', we always have the feeling that the creators are less 'making a film' than playing with toys like we used to do, engaging a tacit complicity with the kids in the audience, and the inner kids within the adults from the audience.'Toy Story' assumes that toys are alive, and the script is so well written that we're immediately convinced. There's no way Woody, the cowboy doll with Tom Hanks' voice couldn't be alive, that the cocky Buzz Lightyear is only a 3D talking image, that Mr. Potato Head isn't that grouchy figurine or that the Tyrannosaurus isn't that cute andcoward creature, all the toys that belong to little Andy incarnate Disney's magical power, bringing things to life, and we realize how we all had a Disney inside us when we were playing with our toys. And 'Toy Story' couldn't have a more appropriate villain than a kid who destroyed toys, Sid: a character I despised so much because I was definitely not a Sid when I was younger. 'Toy Story' is an odyssey in the world of toys after which we don't look at them the same way, calling them objects is almost insulting. Indeed, I've always felt guilty because as a teen, my mother told me to get rid of my toys, to give them to needier boys, and although I didn't play with them anymore, I remember how painful it was to say them goodbye, after 'Toy Story', now I feel better with myself.And 'Toy Story' doesn't just take its creativity and the cuteness of its characters for granted, there are the lines, the humor, but the story too, starting with the antagonism between the two 'lead' toys. Woody is jealous because Buzz, Andy's new birthday gift, became his best friend, in other words, his favorite toy, while Buzz doesn't know he's only a toy and lives in total denial about his true nature, which adds an unexpected bit of poignancy to characters that are not just three-dimensional on a geometrical level. The film has its share of action, mostly with the Buzz and Woody's duo trying to get back to Andy's house before the family moves in, but the emotional core of the film is their friendship. And progressively, their journey will allow them to understand the value of a toy, illustrated by Newman's Oscar-nominated song 'You've Got a Friend in Me'; there would still be room for Woody in Andy's heart and there's an inner nobility in toys in the way they bring happiness during our most treasured memories.'Toy Story' is a beautiful friendship story between two lovable toys, (have you noticed that Buzz and Woody makes buddy if you associate them), whose friendship culminate at the moment where both 'fall with style' in Andy's box. And I guess this is why we hardly remember how groundbreaking 'Toy Story' was, maybe we just forgot about the special effects and the whole 3D thing, and simply remember the beauty of the story.",10,1,1,11 January 2012
Men in Black," No neuralyzer will be powerful enough to make you forget this experience ...
","Through its effective combination of action, imagery and wit, 'Men in Black' accomplishes the same exploit than 'Back to the Future' and deserves the title of the second most classic Sci-fi comedy ever.Indeed, being the genre that requires the most expensive budgets, the most use of special effects, art-design and make-up, and relying on the difficult premise of spectacular entertainment and philosophical insights about human condition, Sci-fi was the most likely genre to be condemned for gravity and solemnity, no matter how heart-pounding the action is. Hence the heavyweights like 'Blade Runner', 'Terminator 2', 'Avatar' or more recently 'Prometheus', when it's all about wowing the audience, plunging viewers in a world of wonders and amazement, their disbelief suspended beforehand.How refreshing now to have a movie like 'Men in Black', one of the most original contributions to Sci-fi but never taking both genre and budget for granted, and as a result, never taking itself seriously. 'MIB' is a hilarious spy-action-comedy involving probably the coolest-looking secret agency of the same name, well with their Ray-Ban sunglasses and black and white suits; they sure have the coolest outfits. And talk about a thrilling job: monitoring aliens who visit or live on Earth, and controlling their movements inside and outside the planet. In fact, they're not even aliens but inter-galactic immigrants.And it really suits the film that it introduces the MIB during an arrest of illegal immigrants. Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) and his partner intercept the patrol, and quickly exposes the alien, a weird bug-eyed Mexican who doesn't seem to understand one word of Spanish. His face reveals to be a human mask only held by a creature that bears some strange resemblance –sorry for the outrageous reference- with the monster in 'Howard the Duck's'. The monster jumps on the horrified border patrolman but is immediately blown-up by Agent K spilling a disgusting blue slime all over the place and the poor guy's face.And then comes the key moment that unveils the film's most memorable device (after the black suits and sunglasses): the neuralyzer. Just one red flash, and the witness's memories of their recent sightings (and prevent the agency from some undesirable publicity) are instantly erased. Not only the poor patrolman and his colleagues have no clue about what is going on, but K's partner who feels it's time to retire will get the same treatment. He watches the stars in the dark sky and sadly declares 'I'll miss the chase', to which K answers 'No you won't', putting on his trademark sunglasses, and adjusting the neuralyzer.The film cuts to Edwards (Will Smith) a NYPD officer chasing an extraordinarily fast and agile criminal who leaves no doubt about his 'extra-terrestrial' background. No one believes Edwards, except for the coroner Dr. Laura Weaver who just discovered some pretty weird stuff during her autopsy, her enthusiasm will be abruptly cut in one neuralyzing flash from agent K. He confronts him with a pawnshop owner (Tony Shalhoub) in order to find out the model of weapon used by the alien, Geebs knows nothing and then the bad cop/ good cop routine is suddenly interrupted by K blowing Geeb's head off  but only as a warning, the head grows back, contributing to one of the film's most defining moment.Still, Edwards is not part of the secret anymore and as we expect, gets a little red flash in the eye (believe me, it never gets redundant) However, K finds some potential in Edwards and leaves him a business card to assist to a recruiting session. The test, the admission in the headquarters, the little aliens who specialized in making coffee, and Rip Torn as Z, the head of the agency, everything is a triumph of design and humor. The 'MIB' is like an intergalactic 'spaceport' with the widest range of Aliens' you'll find in a film, but even the most rudimentary is more convincing than 'Independence Day' atrocious octopuses.And the place works as a galactic bureau of investigation as well with all the procedural you'd expect, and treated the most seriously. And that's the greatest thing about 'MIB' that aliens are visiting Earth or trying to find a cover is treated as if it was the most ordinary thing in the world. In a brief screen showing different undercover aliens, we can immediately spot Sylvester Stallone, these gags are the soul of 'Men in Black'. And don't get me started with Pavillon State monument used as a disguise for two spaceships or a weird fireball being the cause of New York 1977 black-out.But these gags work less because of their content than the way they're delivered. Tommy Lee Jones, with his humorless and very matter-of-fact tone, makes the weirdest information sound totally normal, therefore more hilarious. And the funniest thing is that we end up believing him. Would you believe he'll get the hottest information from cheap tabloid newspapers? Well, in fact, given the context of the film, it all makes sense.However, the rhythm slows down a little because such a film still needs a villain who can only lead to more formulaic situation. The bad guy is played by Vincent d'Onofrio as a hillbilly whose skin was used to cover a hideous cockroach-like monster. His plot involves a small galaxy held by an Alien from an enemy planet, but it's not as creative as the whole set-up and while Fiorentino tries to find a place between the two leads, the film is never as funny and absorbing as when it involves Agent K and Agent J. The ending is perfect though with a last shot that teaches us a wonderful lesson of intergalactic-humility.As a comedy, 'MIB' captures the existential Sci-fi spirit more than serious films : life's a joke, but stars are still beautiful to watch or to paraphrase Will Smith, the difference between 'MIB' and other Sci-fi, is that comedy makes it look good.",9,5,7,2 August 2013
The Graduate," The greatest cinematic heritage of the 60's ...
","Hello darkness, my old friend ... the melancholic melodies of Simon and Garfunkel transport 'The Graduate' to a dimension, no movie has ever reached  I can't describe how Mike Nichols' masterpiece affected me on that night I watched it for the first time. It was a unique experience inviting me to laugh, to contemplate, to meditate, while mirroring my own condition and carrying it, smoothly, quietly, unconsciously to a mysterious place that only I, could approach  and no one else. 'The Graduate' became for me, the epitome of cinematic escapism forever graved in my memory ... hell, I even dreamed of it that very night! I know an academic analysis of 'The Graduate' would cover many paragraphs relating the cultural impact of the film, its iconic status from the red Alfa Romeo to Mrs. Robinson 'seducing' legs, its politically incorrect tone that unsettled America's puritan morality on the breakthrough year of 1967, through the love affair between an awkward graduate and an alcoholic middle-aged cougar. So let's not spoil the extraordinary feeling with ordinary material. I was already aware about the film's status before, 'Wayne's World 2' and many episodes of 'The Simpsons' 'spoiled' it for me  but it didn't ruin my experience nonetheless, because the enjoyment was elsewhere.The film is a timeless coming of age comedy with a dramatic approach denouncing in a light-hearted tone the emptiness of the bourgeois way of life, from the point of view of a young educated man, questioning his future, conscious of this superficiality. Ben was my hero. The contrast between the cheers and the congratulations of his parent's friends at his graduation's party and his uneasiness highlights this condition of a social pawn, only meant to reproduce his parent's shallow social model. Ben inspired me as the bourgeois version of the 'rebel without a cause'. At the time I watched the film, I was freshly graduated, I wanted something different too, and when my parents asked me 'why', I couldn't answer. This is Ben's trap and his affection for the fishes in his tanks underlines a sense of empathy, like when he's pushed to test his skin-diving outfit. Water would play a very symbolical role as the incarnation of this environment he can't escape from. 'Water' as the source of Ben's awkwardness and Mrs. Robinson his safety belt. Dustin Hoffman and Anne Bancroft create the perfect contrast between two attitudes, lucidity and inexperience, providing an excellent mix of visual and verbal humor in the first act.The prologue breaks with the 'act' illustrated by the vision of Ben floating on his rubber raft, in the swimming pool. He's floating this time, dominating the allegoric water with Simon and Garfunkel's mesmerizing sound. His love affair became a routine as both help each other to fill the meaningless of their lives and during this long musical sequence, Ben aimlessly contemplates his life, unaware that he's still going nowhere ... like contaminated by the contemptuous idleness typical of the upper class. Finally, pushed by his parents, Ben is forced to date Mrs. Robinson's daughter Elaine, he slides off the raft and goes underwater again, trapped again. But the trap hides a revelation; Ben falls in love with Elaine making Mrs. Robinson an enemy on a symbolically rainy day and ultimately loses Elaine.But Ben found the true meaning of his life and will follow her till Berkley. A romantic stalking poetically conducted by the beautiful 'Scarborough Fair' song and providing the second wave of jokes in the film after a dramatic part. In the beginning, the contrasts were between Ben's popularity and the perversity of his actions while in the last act, the comic of opposition, is driven by Ben getting more and more disrespected and hated only to fulfill a romantic dream ... but being loved by Elaine is worth being hated by the whole world, and he understands that even Elaine lives the same dilemma. She's not indifferent, she's almost convinced, she kisses Ben ... and even the mood of the songs changes. I still whistle the iconic rhythm of 'Mrs. Robinson' whenever I'm in an enthusiastic mood and this song is the one I immediately associate with audacity, youth, and this mix of craziness that drive our lives like we drive an Alfa Romeo till the last drop of gas.One must wonder why it worked though, why she accepted to be 'kidnapped' from the church in the iconic climax ... in real life, if you screamed 'Elaaaaaaine' while hitting a big glass, would you hear a strident 'Beeeeeen!' crying for your help ? I don't know, but without this climax, the movie would have been guilty of seriousness. 'The Graduate' is an escapism pushed to the extreme limit of a fantasy. This is probably why it gained more criticism by mature critics ... I even suspect Ebert of having been too influenced by Kael who disliked the manipulative aspect of the film as soon as Ben became a hero, and Mrs. Robinson a villain. I think this is precisely the dimension I was mentioning in the beginning. It's an escapist movie for people who identify with this youth who don't know what life is about, it's a hymn for immaturity, for this excitement that makes life enjoyable, freedom to make our own mistakes, believing that it's never 'too late'... that's the inspiring spirit of 'The Graduate'! And this enigmatic smile at the end while they're together in the bus, says as much as 'Mona Lisa' for the painting Art: what are they thinking, are they happy, are they regretting ... I think they're just floating but not in a raft trapped in a swimming pool, in a bus that follows a direction ... which one? Who cares? At least it's going somewhere, so just let yourself transported ... within ... the sound ... of ... Simon ...",10,2,3,4 June 2011
Pride & Prejudice," The shortest way between two hearts is never a straight line ...
","Most of the delight provided by Joe Wright's 'Pride and Prejudice' is that the late 18th century material of Jane Austen's celebrated novel is handled with a subtle but imperceptible modern touch. It is as though the heroines were not much different from high school girls of two centuries later, not that the movie was modernized in such a way it betrayed Jane Austen's spirit but in its clearly stated intention to target a younger audiences, it found the perfect note and tone to that, much more with the perfect actresses. It's not even a coincidence that all the plot-driving Bennett sisters are played by future A-list players: Carey Mulligan, Rosamund Pike and last but not least, Keira Knightley. Today, they gathered more Oscar nominations together than Donald Sutherland... in one of his most charming and endearing roles as a father stricken by the blessing (or the curse) of having only daughters.Watching these sisters interact during the film reminded of this cliché of teenage girls gossiping, wondering if the school heartthrob said this or that, or how they can approach him without looking too pushy or needy. It's all the same game in 'Pride & Prejudice' but it works even better in the film because the stakes are higher than a simple flirt or a date, the film is about marriage and we all know what it meant in the 18th century, for girls as much as men. A man with a profession and a good fortune had to be married, at eighteen, a girl had to find such a man, all she had to do was to be pretty, fertile, other considerations such as wit and personality were more or less important. The point was that anyone with a daughter had to make it a matter of honor to prevent her from being a spinster, Mrs. Bennett (Brenda Betthlyn) had five daughters, so it wasn't a part-time job, she would know no rest before she'd marry the youngest one, and yes, they had to be married in order, in order not to show that one had been passed over.It's a whole marketing process where money was at stakes as well as love matters. With five daughters, only a male distant cousin of the family, the boring Mr. Collins (Tom Hollander) would inherit from the Bennett's landowning fortune. There are parameters to be taken into consideration and urgency is one of them. And the intelligence of the film is not to overdo the 'modernity' card. Indeed, had it ever tried to criticize them indirectly, that would've been too artificially feminist for its own good, but even Lizzie, who is the most free-spirited sister, accepts the obligation of marriage as part of life requirements, because she's also, like any girl of her age, in quest of a true love, and she's not deprived of bad looks. Keira Knightley is perfect with that unique combination of youthful full-bloom beauty, mature intelligence and that cute smile that oddly distorts her lips and shrink her eyes, a sight that melts my heart every time. She's typically the girl any man would fall in lover with, but obviously, she's not for any man. One of the most painful moments is when Cousin Collins, as boring a pastor as vertically challenged, asks her for marriage and she finds the proper words to put him in his place, diplomatic, polite but final.She does so, because if not her heart, her mind is still invaded by the figure of Mr. Darcy (Matthew MacFayden) a handsome and smoothly brooding friend of the more sociable and jovial Mr. Bingley (Simon Woods) who just moved next to the Bennetts and seems to have grown a mutual fondness with the older sister Jane (Rosamund Pike). Jane, as a naturally shy girl, doesn't express her excitement enough although she likes Bingley, and at the risk of not appearing needy, she dangerously lets her attitude slide toward a form of cold distance during the crucial ball scene. Meanwhile, a few exchanges between Lizzie and Darcy showed the obligatory dislike at first sight but one of a peculiar sort that can't fool us, it's acted in such a way that we can't believe these two persons aren't made for each other. Interestingly, the growing romance between Jane and Bingley allows Lizzie and Darcy to meet more regularly despite their official façade of animosity. Of course, the romance won't go without a series of misunderstandings, properly set as narrative obstacles, the most memorable involve a dashing young captain named Mr. Wickham (Rupert Friend) in contention with Darcy and a domineering aunt, played by Judi Dench, who has other plans for Darcy. The movie is a powerful illustration that the shortest way between two hearts is never a straight line, but neither the bitchy aunt or the presumptuous captain are as effective antagonists in the film as the titular pride and prejudice, prejudice hurts one's pride and a hurt pride paves the way to prejudice, and most the excitement comes from watching these two hearts trying to get out of that vicious circle...... that, and seeing Mrs. Bennett desperately praising her daughters' charms and virtues as if she was trying to be the saleswoman of the month.",9,0,2,24 July 2015
Singin' in the Rain," What a Glorious Feeling ..
","And what a glorious film ... #5 film in AFI's Top 100 movies, #1 musical, #16 romance and #16 comedy, 'Singin in the Rain' doesn't celebrate Hollywood, it defines it through a range of emotions, so rich that you can't finish this timeless classic without shouting : 'Now, that's entertainment!' If there is ever a movie for which the word iconic takes its full meaning, 'Singin' in the Rain' takes the cake, and an appetizing one where you can expect the beautiful Debbie Reynolds jumping out of it. With Donald O'Connor and Gene Kelly, she forms the so lovable trio that sets the cheerful mood in the opening sequence : holding their umbrellas, wearing raincoats, they enthusiastically walk and express their joy to be simply 'singin in the rain'. Indeed, the title itself, beyond its reference to the most memorable song, embodies the film's main feeling, something so positive it's impossible to write a review without using up all the synonyms of 'happiness'.'Singin' in the Rain' incarnates a quite hedonistic philosophy of life, inspiring the most positive emotions even when the natural elements don't help. While many people try to run for a dry spot, afraid to get wet and catch a cold, Gene Kelly's let himself getting rain soaked while his heart is basking under sunshine of love. He savors the moment with a total carelessness, inviting the rain to come at him. This part doesn't only work because of the communicative aspect of the 'glorious' feeling, but also as an incredibly inspirational moment in its sheer simplicity. The image of Kelly swinging on the lamppost, is the eternal allegory of happiness that only Cinema could have illustrated, a happiness going through every possible stage, delight, pleasure, enchantment until it becomes a totally jubilant moment where Kelly literally splashes on a ocean of joy, until he faces a cop, whose presence puts an end to this orgasmic mayhem, and the melody can finally end  leaving us with these immortal lines 'I'm dancing and singing in the rain'This is one of these magical sequences that immediately penetrated people's hearts and, once and for all, our universal heritage. No one can imagine this film without immediately thinking of the rain, the lamppost and Gene Kelly's illuminating smile. I can't evoke the film, I can't watch it or live it without it bringing me back to my childhood memories. I discovered the song through one of its countless parodies, and it stuck in my mind right away. Once, my dad saw a documentary about the film and immediately called me to see if I that sequence rang a bell. Another day, still as a child, I saw a documentary about Hollywood MGM Golden Age, only waiting for the 'Singin' in the Rain' part  and when I got to see the film, I finally surprised myself by enjoying the comedy more than the musical, and 'Make 'em laugh' by Donald O'Connor, became my favorite part.'Make' em Laugh' is another amazing achievement that works alone as an efficient antidepressant. Donald O'Connor accomplishes an impressive acrobatic number, extending his comedic performance to every single element of slapstick, with a natural goofiness and perfect timing that makes it look like a spontaneous act of virtuosity and makes you forget about the rehearsal this would have probably taken : you just open your eyes, and admire the performance. He laughs, smiles, makes funny faces, gravity-defying moves with one motto, no ... not 'dignity, dignity' but on the contrary trading any sense of dignity in order to make the other laugh, or giggle, or smile or at least feel good. O'Connor is the perfect clown without any ounce of sadness, the scene-stealing comic relief of a rather hilarious comedy! The movie doesn't disobey the implicit golden rule that there's no better comedy than one with a heart, and the heart of the film belongs to the exquisite Debbie Reynolds, whose character has the merit of having 'inspired' the iconic rain sequence. She's extremely poignant in her lack of confidence and her will to help her friends that we automatically feel for her, as he would do to a Disney Princess. This analogy is not fortuitous and probably explains why I enjoyed the comedy more than the romance, the funny musical numbers more than the serious ones, the villain more than the princess. What a villain by the way, hard to imagine the film's success without the incredible Lina Lamont, played by Jean Hagen who provides perhaps more laughs than O'Connor in the comedy department, with her voice, speech mannerism and hilarious 'What am I dumb or something?' catchphrase.My last comment didn't intend to diminish the merit of the romance but I don't really see it as the movie's highlight although it features many memorable scenes. When Kelly as Lockwood says to Lina : 'I don't like her half as I hate you', I think he sums it up quite well, as many fans probably love the romance but not as much as they adore the comedy. And count me also among those who fail to see the relevancy of the whole 'Broadway Melody' sequence that kind of deviated from the intelligence of the plot and weakened its 'vis comica'. 'Singin' in the Rain' had to keep on the clever homage to that crucial transition to talking pictures and self-reflexive celebration of the genre that consecrated the triumph of talking pictures, the genre that probably best incarnates the bright side of Hollywood : musicals. As flashy, flamboyant and enjoyable as it was, the scene could've been shorter, end up with a kind of punchline or at least respected the 'Make' em laugh!' motto.I rated it a 9 because of the Broadway sequence, but the rest of the film deserves a 11 as one of the greatest comedies and the greatest musical ever, even better than 'Guys and Dolls' put together.",9,2,3,12 September 2011
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Of Understanding Feelings and Loving Personalities
","'The heart has its reasons, which reason does not know.' Pascal's famous quote exudes a sense of instant obviousness on the irrational aspect of love, love as feeling, love as a bridge between two souls but once you dig deeper in that notion, you realize that it's not much about love being irrational but maybe of love being built on 'fantasy', as a euphemism for lies. We can love someone, this is a sentiment human beings are most capable of, but take love as something other than a feeling, as a contract, a commitment and then the word 'fantasy' takes its full meaning because only through a fantasized version of the other, one can sacrifice his freedom of being true to his and her nature, becoming a fantasy in return.I'm reading myself and I don't think I'm being clear. I think what Michel Gondry's movie or let's say the script written by Charlie Kauffman, who wrote 'Being John Malkovich' and 'Adaptation.', is that the mind of someone is a world by itself, it is made of rational and irrational stuff, lost dreams and hopes, dreams and lost hopes, visions of reality, lies, regrets and more than anything memories, it's not much the memories that shape our individuality but the way we perceive them. By that logic, a relationship between two persons represent a real collision of two worlds, where hearts create bridges that minds have a hard time to cross. There's a moment in the film where Clementine says that she doesn't like what she became in her relationship with Joel, it's quite a powerful statement about the way love interfere with our being, and maybe the mind is the only sphere of freedom one is allowed to keep.'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind', the film that finally earned Kauffman a long overdue Oscar, allows us to venture in the mind of Joel Barish, a meek and timid young man played by Jim Carrey and who falls in love with Clementine, a free-spirited girl who feels a strange attraction, maybe a feeling of completion in that sponge of a man who allows her to be true to herself. The non-linear narrative makes us suspect that there might be a 'history' between these two souls, why would they meet during Valentine's Day, in a cold beach in Montauk. The credits come after about a quarter of an hour, when we're taken back in the past and realize that they indeed knew each other and because it didn't end happily, Clementine had registered to a program that allows to erase memories of failed relationships. Joel decides to follow the same program.And this is only the premise, the 'what if' question that drives the film. Kaufman is quite good in these starting concepts, what if we could live fifteen minutes in someone else's body, what if a film could chronicle the process of its own creation, what if we could erase memories? That's an existential challenge. I guess there are three or four memories that would totally change my personality if I erased them so yes, this is an issue I would strongly relate to, but in the case of 'Eternal', the idea is more debatable, because love stories aren't meant to end well, so unless it ended with a crime or a rape, why would someone symbolically kill a person he or she loved. Maybe there's a sort of ego-thing, the idea of having lost your time, the desperation, the unhappiness, or maybe that sight of Carrey crying in his car. Love can make you feel lousy indeed.So Joel decides to follow the treatment and we see the medical staff operating on his brains and the film features a strange and somewhat comical situation where he's in a comatose state while the young assistants charged of mapping the brain spots featuring memories of Clementine to wipe them out, are having fun, drinking beer or even takes advantage on the situation in a way I wouldn't spoil, but let's say that Mark Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst, Elijah Wood and Tom Wilkinson being actors and observers of the situation also bring a few insights about the way love works and about the way such a concept would be in fact a remedy worse than the cure itself, they're like the Greek chorus of a tragicomedy whose actions speak so vividly against that memories-erasing concept and you expect it's a matter of time before somewhere Joel feels the need to rebel.And the two thirds of the film are set in the mind of Joel who realizes while venturing in his memories that there's still something strong going between them, and that's the realistic approach of love, it's never as powerful as in the last memory so the more memories you explore, the more likely it is to awake old passions. What follows is an original cat-and-mouse chase in his labyrinthine mind. To a certain extent, It is a gimmick, I enjoyed it in the sense that it didn't overuse the dreamy concept and featured the kind of stuff I would have expected from 'Inception', there were a few surrealistic bits that put Carrey in such situations that undermined the 'seriousness' of his role. He was good but just because he doesn't make grimaces doesn't mean he's pulling a great performance.There's no love but proof of love, only by seeing things that have been done in the name of love that they realized there was a true love, the ending was handled with poetic perfection, while the film was far from being imperfect. I know it is regarded as one of the best movies of the 2000's, but the plot wasn't as elaborate as Kaufman's usual creations and it's like the non-linear editing and overly long second act tried to make the film more complex than what it was, as if it was ashamed of being a straightforward romance of eighty minutes.",7,0,1,18 April 2017
Once Upon a Time in America," We don't spend our lives writing the future, we spend our lives writing the PAST ...
","*** Like the movie starts with the sound of 'God Bless America', I'd like to open this review by the following words : 'God Bless You Signor Leone for this cinematic epitaph, whose only criminal aspect is the unfair butchery that prevented it from a higher recognition in your lifetime. But time did justice to this masterpiece whose greatness transcended the notions of screen time. And wherever you are, I hope that, knowing the reputation of 'Once Upon a Time in America', your smile would be as wide a Mr. De Niro's in the last iconic frame.' *** A kid is about to pay the services of a prostitute with an appetizing pastry. Waiting on the landing, he tastes the cream, licks the paper, takes the cherry, puts it back, and finally succumbing to the irresistible call of childhood -hell with it- he eats it. No words needed for one of the most beautiful scenes in cinema's history, Ennio Morricone's music is enough to remind us that even the most corrupted souls have been pure once.One of these souls is David 'Noodles' Aaronson, a man with memories like a double-edged sword, enriching his heart with so many precious jewels, and tormenting it with the weight of a deadly secret. And we literally endure the guilt through a long sequence where an annoying phone ringing is heard in the foreground. Leone even teases us as the ringing persists when an anonymous hand takes the receiver. It's not about who calls but who's called, during the Prohibition's farewell party, which foreshadows a more brutal farewell.Noodles appeases his remorseful heart in the Chinese theater's opium den then manages to escape from a bunch of goons coming to kill the 'traitor'. He takes the key from the gang's ex-headquarter, Fat Moe's speakeasy. He goes to the train station, opens a locker and takes the briefcase containing all the shared funds of the late gang, its emptiness ironically mirrors Noodles' new condition. He leaves New York, the heart full of a sentiment that Morricone's haunting score beautifully conveys : nostalgia, the death of innocence mourned through the haunting music of a pan flute, also heard in the iconic Manhattan Bridge scene, where Dominick, the youngest kid of the gang, 'slipped'.And in one beautiful ellipse, 'Yesterday'  an old man is back home, 35 years later. The poignant 'Deborah's theme' brings back the nostalgia with an intensity that makes us feel like we grew up in that neighborhood. 'What have you been doing all these years?' asks an older Moe. 'Been going to bed early.', replies a laconic Noodles, whose Proustian innuendo associates his long exile to a wise resignation for nothingness. A sentiment we could feel after half an hour, but Leone trusts our patience : we must understand the value of the loss before plunging into it. And the transition is magical between the eyes of the old and the teenage Noodles watching through the hole in the toilet wall while Deborah, the love of his life, practices her steps.All the transitions are brilliantly directed by lights, from candles or cars, as the allegory of this invisible stuff that only our hearts can see in our reality's darkness, the memories. The whole movie is a dreamy introspection which is one with the history of America, with the childhood part as a tribute to the Great Emigration Wave. Noodles grew up in the New York City's Jewish quarter, a setting reconstructed with a sense of details that reminds of the epic reconstitution of Little Italy in 'The Godfather Part II' and the Feast of San Gennaro has been replaced by Pesach, during which young Deborah reads a poem to Noodles implicitly declaring her love, sincere but impossible.Many years later, after a magnificent dinner, Noodles reveals to her that the two things that prevented him from insanity in jail was the remembrance of Dominick's last words and the last part of his innocence still left in his heart : her. But Deborah, corrupted her way, became a star and leaves a speechless Noodles for Hollywood. Her decision sealed his fate as a vulgar criminal and what followed then in the cab, was the weakest and saddest expression of a man who had nothing to lose anymore, not even pride. Noodles took with strength what his heart couldn't, a desperate act that would haunt him forever.Adulthood terribly distorts the most meaningful things. Max mechanically cleans his shoes, Deborah maliciously tells Noodles to see 'his mom' but something doesn't ring true anymore. Even the tone of the film radically changes, more 'gangster' and political material, and the confusion can be upsetting ... except if we believe that the essential would be elsewhere, especially when 35 years later, the money suddenly resurrects in the train station's briefcase and Deborah reappears from Noodles' eternally point of view : he's old but she looks as young as ever, a poetic irony when we learn she's the mistress of the powerful Senator Bailey, who's no one else but a man from the past.Max resurrects in Noodles' life and asks him, as a redeeming act of vengeance to kill him for he took his money, his girlfriend, his life. Max could easily accept, but he can't afford to lose his pride again, and the most valuable things he still possesses, his memories ... even if the illusory happiness implies an illusory guilt. Noodles, in a voluntary denial, wishes the best for 'Mr Bailey' adding : 'It'd be a shame to see a lifetime of work go to waste.' The last words of the film.And the beautiful 'God Bless America' rocks us like a peaceful lullaby transporting us back to the Chinese theater, where Noodles' heart finally relieved, if not redeemed, can savor his memories  painful, but intact. No words, again for one of the most beautiful endings in cinema's history, only a big smile.",10,4,10,12 July 2011
Taken," Liam Neeson, the perfect combination of 'badass' and 'sensitivity' ...
","Bryan Mills is a former CIA's operative whose longtime dedication earned him on one side 'special skills' (mostly rhyming with kills) and cost him on the other side, his marriage.As a secret agent, he's a combination of James Bond and Steven Seagal but as a husband, not so much. Yet you wonder what his wife Lenore (Famke Jensen) was expecting since she didn't marry a baker or an accountant, but looking at her post-divorce lifestyle and her new rich husband, she naturally feels triumphant over Bryan. But Bryan's attention is focused on his 17-year old daughter Kim (Maggie Grace), he retired for a bodyguard job to spend more time with her. And there's a sort of genuine bond between both. And Liam Neeson is always believable as the misunderstood and hurt father.In twenty minutes, the characters are all set-up, with more or less two-three dimensionality, Kim wants to become a singer, Bryan tries to connect her with a pop artist he protected from an assailant. He bought her a karaoke machine at her birthday, but her step-father out stepped him by offering the most predictable but no less efficient gift: a horse, and not any horse, one that makes the ill-fated 'Khartoom' from 'The Godfather' looks like a pony. The tone is clear, Kim is a cute, spoiled little girl and it's a miracle she didn't turn as bitchy and arrogant as her mother. And the conflict with the mother starts when she allows Kim to travel to Paris, and 'discover the world' with her friend. One step further, she would have bought condoms for her.The script doesn't embarrass itself with subtlety as we immediately take side with Bryan who faces ungratefulness every time. He finds out that the travel in Paris is only the first step to a U2's European tour the two girls want to attend, he doesn't even know that the 'cousins' supposed to chaperon them are in travel. Reluctant to let her girl go, he finally resigns but gives her a cell-phone so she can call him from the international area: his very instinct just saved Kim. I spend time to describe the set-up because the action sequences only work because they rely on a very solid characterization: we follow the film less for the action, than Bryan's motives and the sympathetic feeling Neeson's eyes never cease to inspire.The action takes off when Kim and her friend Amanda are kidnapped by Albanian human traffickers, luckily, Kim has enough time to tell Bryan that strangers came to the house. Bryan knows she'll be kidnapped he tells her to hide under the closest bed and describe the men with as much details as she can, anything can be helpful. She leaves a few indications, but enough to help Bryan to track down the whole network from this point to the end. According to Bryan's friend, the Albanians started abducting foreign travelers and after four days, there are chances Kim would be sold, and it would be impossible to find him. All Bryan has are his martial arts skills, his intelligence, his electronic expertise, his fatherly determination and 96 hours.Bryan is like a combo or John Matrix r in 'Commando' or Jack Bauer from the TV series '24', except that Liam Neeson has a quality in his acting, so efficient that you never see the 'superhero' he is, but the determined father. Without Liam Neeson, there are chances that 'Taken' wouldn't have be 'taken' as seriously and be reduced to another action/thriller movie with a relatively conventional plot, which is actually the case, but one casting, towering in every meaning of the word, all the others is enough to elevate the film, into one of the best and most gripping action/thrillers of the 2000's. And if not the best, it certainly is the most memorable, through its capacity to build fresh material out of new stuff.'A great film consists of three good scenes, and no bad scene', this is the statement of Howard Hawks, I used in some other reviews. Many would spot plot holes or unbelievable scenes, but one bad scene can only be judged on the way it ruins the whole narrative or make us lose our focus. No scene does that, foreign clichés, action overdose, chase, their flaws are forgettable because they all work as links between a few great scenes that redeem all the archetypes, and there are three great scenes in 'Taken'.First, in a year rich in impacting movies such as 'Slumdog Millionaire', 'Milk' or 'The Dark Knight', 'Taken' takes the cake as the most memorable exchange during the infamous father-and-daughter phone that ends with Bryan's speech ordering the 'bad guy', whoever he is, to release the girl, and he'll forget everything, otherwise, he'll track him, find him and execute him. The following 'good luck' with a strong accent is the trigger of Bryan's chase, and makes the confrontation even more 'electrifying'. Finally, Bryan contradicts all the stereotypes of the tough-guy-with-principles by shooting a harmless woman on the arm and threatens to kill her, if her husband doesn't give the information. Not only we believe he means business, but we still like him, hell, even Dirty Harry wouldn't have got away with that.These three moments elevated the film above the usual standards of a simple cat-and-mouse thriller. What do they all have in common? They rely on the menacing presence of Liam Neeson, and his human look on the eyes, this unique capability to look strong and sensitive, to inspire our immediate sympathy. 'Taken' has taken me totally off-guard, and although it's not flawless, and some characters are either underdeveloped or stereotypical, the film has an exhilarating straight-forward direction, as if the director, Pierre Morel was confident on the movie's potential and never tried to 'over-humanize' it, Bryan Mills carries the whole humanity.And this is saying a lot for an action/thriller movie hero.",8,1,4,13 February 2013
This Is Spinal Tap," The Doc' Rock that Rocks... to Eleven and Beyond!
","'Why don't you just make 10 louder, and make 10 be the top number, and make that a little louder?' I was so entranced by Nigel's enthusiastic description of his unique amplifier-model-that-goes-to-eleven that I almost failed to grasp the common sense in Marty Di Bergi's question. It's not about the number indeed but the acoustic referential to determine the degrees of loudness. But how can you teach such a flatly simple notion to someone who doesn't even let you point at the most precious item of his guitar collection.But it's subtler than that, the joke isn't at Nigel's obliviousness but at the fact that his reaction doesn't come as a surprise, Marty's question is almost funnier in the way it makes us expect 'something'. And boy does it reward our expectations, Nigel doesn't even answer, he stops chewing his gum, marks a solemn pause and provides the iconic, laconic and self-sufficient 'these go to eleven'. Both scenes and quotes became staples of 80's comedy summing up what makes Rob Reiner's directorial debut 'This is Spinal Tap' one of the all-time greatest comedies: it knows its subject and what's more, it knows the right attitude to 'amplify' the comedic effects (to eleven and beyond).Everyone knows this is a film about a fictional rock band; the word 'fake' would be too misleading and even insulting. Spinal Tap might not belong to Rock'n'Roll canon, among the Beatles or the Rolling Stones but it's got something to say about rock, as a music, a spirit and a business. In fact, you might learn even more stuff about from this band than any documentary about a real group. And if I had to choose between learning with laughs or without, I'd rather have laughs. Who wouldn't? That's what makes the 'eleven' scene so hilarious. Apart from the pedagogical value on the field of amplifiers, the way Christopher Guest delivers the quotes with that deadpan expression turns a rather banal quote into a punch-line of comedic genius. And all the movie works with the same mechanisms, David St Hubbins (Christopher McKean) and Derek Smalls (Harry Shearer) are totally oblivious to the hilarity of their statements, all delivered in the most casual way.That first scene alone is one of the highest summits of comedy and sets the tone of zaniness that will structure all the gags, from their first name 'The Originals' to the first drummer (played by Ed Begley Jr.) who died in a freak accident, in fact every single drummer's accident is a try-not-to-laugh challenge where I fail every time. But again, it's not just the writing, mostly improvised, but also the acting, the documentary-like shooting allows many abrupt cuts and swiftly eluded moments where one couldn't keep a straight face.Watching the band telling these anecdotes about a drummer choking in someone else's vomit ('which police can't dust off') or one that exploded suddenly is funny enough, but the face of Reiner repeatedly nodding as if it was really serious is the key to the film's enjoyment. And most of the gags involved the craziest situations where they all try to keep a straight face, Smalls being locked in a cocoon, the group lost backstage, and some verbal delights involving a sexist disc cover not to mention terrific cameos that include Fran Dresher, Bruno Kirby and Anjelica Huston.And the film never forgets to rock as a doc as well, it follows all the details of a tour organization and the struggle of the manager played by Tony Hendra, to book a concert, a hotel suite, or deal with matters of size from bread that is too small for the ham or a Stonehedge replica risking to be crushed by two gig-dancing dwarfs (paraphrasing David). You have a gag that works in a tertiary tempo, the set-up when you know there's going to be trouble. Then you have the musical interlude where you wait for the majestic entrance of the replica and the reactions of the band (who didn't know). The film even provides a little icing on the cake with St Hubbins' final comment.So, it might be improvised, but there's a sense of timing as acute and inspired as if it was used for music. The best compliment one can make to the film is that these guys are as good as musicians as they're comedians. And as far as I'm concerned, their music is credible enough to make the film feel real. And what makes the authenticity so palpable lies on these subtleties you notice after several viewings. The most delightful aspect involves the homoerotic subtext between Nigel and David (let's face It, Smalls is only slightly more famous than the drummers) and when Nigel's girlfriend comes in the picture, there's just something fading in Nigel it's actually touching.'This is Spinal Tap' recreates the documentary feeling without resorting to cheap laughs. Near the end, there's even a sort of bittersweet feeling as their path comes to its logical conclusion, this might explain why many artists like Ozzie Osborne didn't actually laugh at it, that's how accurate it was. And the miracle of this film is to have provided powerful insights about rock business through a lousy and fictional band. But the film aged so well that no one would even use these adjectives to Spinal Tap, and rightfully so.And that concludes my 1111th review for IMDb, seriously, what other film would have I picked for this occasion? And while you're here, you might check one of the polls I suggested a few years ago about four-word movie quotes, guess which movie took the 11th spot? Yeah, that's right!",10,1,3,26 July 2017
Avatar," Join the Na'vis
","I must admit the film had me at the very beginning, when a paraplegic says that he loves to dream because dreams make running and walking possible, my head keeps nodding as if it was mounted on springs. And the emotional outcome of that moment occurs when the Marine Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) wakes up in his avatar's new skin and doesn't feel any weirdness, he's just so happy he starts to run as if he was in a dream, as if nothing mattered anymore, not even the mission. I loved that moment because it felt surreal yet so real, Sully wouldn't have cared about looking like Jar-Jar Binks if it made him feel his toes again. Youssa better believe it.And this might be Cameron's way to tell us that even something as big as 'Avatar' started as a tiny dream, and the first images with the hybrid Na'vis might have inspired him the same eccstatic reaction than Sully, his babies were alive, in synthetic images but alive nonetheless! Now, maybe it's because 'Avatar' involves a giant alien species but the film is so cinematically 'big' that it doesn't just dwarf other movies, it dwarfs any attempt to criticize it on the sole basis that the plot carries many déjà vu feelings. You see me coming, but come on, who the hell am I to say, this movie is a retread of 'Pocahontas', 'Dances With Wolves' or 'Princess Mono-noke'? James Cameron himself admitted to have made the story out of several inspiration and that included his childhood books and his mothers' dreams. Was 'Titanic' any more original? Yet it made Cameron the king of the world. 'Avatar' turned him into an undisputed Emperor and the film was so unique, inventive in the concept and innovative in the treatment that it flies over the critic.That's not to say you can't criticize it but the amount of things worthy of praise is so overwhelming critics would be like complaining that the Sphinx misses a nose. So I guess I'd feel better if I gave 'Avatar' ten points already and then talk about the eventual little things that-could-have-been-better. So let's goI still remember how big 'Avatar' was in 2009, the last film to be as big without belonging to the 'Star Wars' franchise was 'Titanic' so since this was from the same director, people knew they were going to be blown away before swallowing the first popcorn. And they were. Yes the film is marvelously looking but it's CGI. I loved it as far as I can appreciate a good Pixar movie but reading Roger Ebert's reviews, I felt like he loved the film on the sole basis that it created a whole new world, and that it didn't matter that the film didn't break any narrative ground.Now, does it matter? Not really, I also praised 'Titanic' while it wasn't the most original story ever, but it had characters I cared for, and worthy antagonists. There was a moment in 'Avatar' where the scientist played by Sigourney Weaver was describing the power of trees, the way they use their roots as a synapses and so on (which can be a rationalization for the trees' magical power in 'Pocahontas'). This part had me intrigued and involved but then Ribisi's character had to ruin it by saying 'there are just goddamn trees'. I was baffled by his lack of empathy, it's just as if they wanted to supply his mouth with some villain's dialogue and the same awkward attempts were made with the Captain of the mission played by Stephen Lang.Basically, you have the good natives, who behave exactly like extra-terrestrial natives and you have the good and the bad white and in the role of Lieutenant John Smith Dunbar, there's Worthington. The film recycled so many plots elements that it's difficult to disconnect your cliché-radar. But if the radar doesn't work, how about forgetting about the story and listening to the dialogue, the new language Cameron invented by pulling a Tolkien, watching the little details in the scenery, yes, yes CGI, but what CGI! We're not talking about any computer imagery, this is a vision that kept on Cameron's mind since before 'Titanic' and he waited for the technological advances to make them possible. Even the king of the world was disarmed but he wisely waited for the right time and it became the highest-grossing film of all time. Any good team of computer programmers could have done it, the film is a feast to the eyes, it's a deep story, but I was reminded that there were more than special effects to make a film, 'Avatar' might not be a triumph of storytelling but it doesn't have a bad story to tell, its environmentalist issues, the way they foreshadow our future needs, echo some masterpieces from Miyazaki. In fact, I kept thinking of Mono-noke while watching the film, now is the film less worthy of praise because one was drawn? Let's say I prefer the way there's no villains in 'Mono-noke' but to Cameron's defense, the film couldn't have had another third act. And let's acknowledge the creative force behind the very concept of the avatar and the beauty of the Na'vis; Cameron created a world, a myth, he stole George Lucas' thunder and proved that cinema wouldn't just rely on 'Star Wars' and then on comic-book movies. The man had guts, vision and the guts to follow his vision and he also had the dough. You refuse nothing to the king of the world, but if all it took to make great movies was money, blockbusters would never flop. 'Avatar' was deemed to succeed, because it was a game changer. And as far as critics go, the game is over.",10,1,1,28 September 2017
Toy Story 2," Play with your toys, but not with their feelings ...
","The first 'Toy Story' was on the same historical significance than 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs', it established the digital revolution that would change (literally) the face of animation, forever. This is perhaps why most of the praise was concentrated on the technological achievement, the 'toy' aspect rather than the 'story'. We were all moved by the endearing relationship between Andy and his cowboy doll Woody (Tom Hanks), immortalized in the 'You've got a friend in me' song, we also smiled at the little rivalry between Woody and Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) turning with style into a touching friendship, and we all laughed at all the secondary characters populating this great adventure, from Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles) to the cowardly dinosaur (Wallace Shawn) but nonetheless, we revered 'Toy Story' for the amazing visual experience.But in 1999, 'Toy Story' was already part of history, and any similar movie would most likely be judged for its content. And being the sequel to a successful film wouldn't be enough to ensure its success or its reason to be released on the theaters. And this is where, in the case of 'Toy Story 2', the writing makes all the difference. Indeed, after exploring the psychology of toys within their relationships with their owners, the second opus goes further in that existentialism by confronting the toys to both their future and past. The story starts when Woody is stolen by a guy working in a toy factory, panning to sell it to a toy collector in Japan, among other props from the same Western theme, including Bullseye, Woody's legendary horse, Jessie the Yodeling Cowgirl (Joan Cusack) and Stinky Pete, a Gold Prospector (Kelsey Grammar) still living in his package.Like the best sequels, when you think no new character can steal the show, you have one that gets instantly stuck in your heart. Any viewer would see in Jessie, the premise of a predictable romance with Woody (well, there are some romantic vibes between the two toys) but there's more in Jessie to earn our sympathy: a wound from the past, the revelation that she too had her 'Andy' before the worst happened: she got old. Her melancholy is expressed through a touching song 'When She Loved Me', and a sad nostalgic sequence showing a little girl playing with her cowboy doll, before her main interests would become make up, clothes, phones and (ugh!) boysÂ… I love that sequence, it is as deep and emotional as the unforgettable montage from 'Up' and for once, it confronts teenage girls to their constant obsession to become women fast. If only because a 14-year old girl would think, 'why do I want to grow up?' 'Toy Story 2' accomplishes something great.And there's more in that scene that induces this guilt, the rejection endured by toys, and the realization of Woody that the happiness he lives with Andy is only a matter of years, before hormones tickle his mind and make him think about girls. Then, Woody imagines that the eventuality of being owned by a toy collector is the only light of hope for such a dark fate, at one point, he is almost excited to know that he'll live with someone who'll value him forever. After all, wasn't he a big star who had his own Western TV show in the 50's? Why would he end up in a dump, a box of forgotten items or a dusty attic? What Woody doesn't know is that all his friends came to rescue him, lead by the real hero of the story: Buzz Lightyear. And in their perilous adventure, they discover where they come from: a toy factory, offering us a marvelous sequence whose highlights are a Tour Guide Barbie, and the magical moment when Buzz discovers the Buzz Lightyear shelves.Basically, there are two parallel stories in 'Toy Story 2'. Woody discovers how valuable he became because he's getting rarer and unique, and Buzz sees how worthless he is, having so many replicas, outside Andy's house, he's not the center of the universe, and is easily replaceable. But both are wrong, because there's one thing, that puts them on the same level of worth, they have ANDY written in their feet and that's the difference, for one little kid, they are priceless. It might be temporary but the excitement is worth being lived, a toy is to be played with, not to be worshiped and valued, and that's the mistake collectors commit. I am just collecting old comic books (yeah, I'm a geek) but I don't think I ever find time to read them, so where is all the fun? Stinky Pete tries to convince Woody that he's wrong, but since he's the only toy not to have been played with, his reaction is explainable, we understand his bias.But let's not spoil the rest of the story, because beyond all this existentialism, 'Toy Story' is an extraordinary adventure movie, playing with the concept of toys evolving in the real world, including their own world, allowing them to solve personal issues. The film is amazing for children's eyes, and insightful for nostalgic adults, it's entertaining at best, and certainly one of the sequels that almost outshine the original, to the point I wondered why it wasn't Oscar-nominated for Best Animated Feature and Best Writing. Anyway I spent a great moment watching the film. And normally, I hate the bloopers during the end credits, even for comedies, but in that particular case, I'll make an exception. The ending was hilarious, a fitting (temporary) conclusion for one of the greatest animated film of the last 20 years, which is saying a lot.",9,0,1,15 May 2014
Chariots of Fire," Faith That Can Move Mountains ...
","'The important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle, the essential thing is not to have conquered but to have fought well.' Pierre de Coubertin (1863-1937)I expected the 1981 Best Picture, Hugh Hudson's 'Chariots of Fire', to be a glorious illustration of this quotation from the father of Modern Olympics. How wrong I was. On the contrary, 'Chariots of Fire' is the flamboyant depiction of the heart-burning thirst for victory and self-achievement through a thought-provoking, never cynical and always sincere, Oscar-winning script.The film opens with the eulogy of one of the greatest British athletes, Harold Abrahams, and then the image directly fades to the movie's most emblematic scene and probably one of the most iconic opening sequences from any film, the slow-motion beach running. This part is driven by Vangelis' inspirational score that perfectly matches the film's spirit, like 'Midnight Express' or 'High Noon''s theme. Maybe I speak for myself, but when I watched the film for the first time, I thought 'Oh, so that's where this music comes from!' Rarely had the iconic status of a film preceded its knowledge, and 'Chariots of Fire' is one of the few, that features recognizable elements even before being watched.Ironically, the opening scene can be as misleading as Coubertin's line, conveying the inspirational aspect of sports as a necessary team-spirit builder while in fact, the runners are less a team than a group of individuals who run for distinct reasons. Looking at them gives some early hints about their personal conceptions regarding sport. Harold Abrahams is concentrated, he doesn't smile, totally absorbed by a dream of victory which in his eyes, looks like a matter of life and death. Eric Liddel is like carried by the wind, in a sort of symbiosis with an invisible power. And Andrew Lindsay has a touching childish smile, wiping sand from his mouth, exuding a genuine positivity that three letters can eloquently summarize : fun.Sport in 'Chariots of Fire' is only the medium used to express something much deeper made palpable by the script. We all have different reasons to enjoy or to be passionate and the point is not whether these reasons are good or not, but if we can remain faithful to them. What could have been –and I don't mean that in a pejorative way– a 'Rocky' in a stadium, became a formidable lesson of integrity, through the two pillar characters Harold Abrahams and Eric Liddel, two prodigious, two different athletes, but whose extraordinary attachment to personal values and principles allowed them to fulfill their dreams. And this is the 'something more' I was evoking. 'Chariots of Fire' is not about going the distance, about winning, but about integrity.Harold Abrahams is a young Cambridge student whose Jewish ethnicity cemented a strong feeling of being an outsider, despite his brilliant education and undeniable patriotism. He seems to be the only one to really take it personally but the point is not to judge if Harold is right or wrong to feel that way, but to realize how this built his ferocious ambition to win, even leading him to hire a professional coach when the philosophy of the Olympic Games idealized the amateur sportsmanship. Harold runs less for winning than against the insupportable idea of losing, because his ethnicity can't allow him to be ordinary. His passion is the euphemism for an ego-driven ambition, destined to honor his heritage. Coubertin's spirit is one thing but don't we most often remember the name of the winner, don't we say : may the best win? 'God made me for a purpose. But he also made me fast. And when I run, I feel his pleasure.' This is from Eric Liddel, the son of Scottish missionaries established in China, a man who abandoned rugby for religion, until put in recurrent situations that proved him how running was part of his destiny. According to Liddel, the best way to honor God, is to honor His gift. The movie could be taken as a pro-religious film, which is not, if you listen carefully (another credit to the Oscar winning script), this declaration to his sister echoes Cambridge's Master of Trinity opening speech inviting the young students to find their own paths and never let people influence them. This is what having principles is about, an idea illustrated by the issue concerning Eric's refusal to run during the Sabbath Day. It's good to have beliefs that inspire a passion, as long as the passion doesn't encourage you to deny these beliefs. Integrity is the ultimate victory, and compromising is the terrible admittance of defeat.Whether it's for God, for ego or for fun, the movie is an extraordinary introspection into these abstractions that inspire the best from us, it's not about medals, about speeches, but it's the whole feeling of having accomplished whatever we feel born for. The most poignant moment of the film is when Harold's coach, Ian Holm as the scene-stealer Mussabini, pierces the top of his hat while hearing 'God Save the Queen' and understands that Harold won, his 'My Son' is a personal appropriation of Harold's merit. Victory is not an end but a mean, and only the cheers and applauds at the end remind us that the mission of sportsmen is also to both impress and inspire people, through a mutual sentiment of pride. And that the movie is set between two devastating World Wars, is not coincidental, for Sport is still the greatest affirmation of human spirit and war, its polar opposite.'Chariots of Fire' is an inspirational masterpiece, inviting us to find the little spark that will inspire us to achieve ourselves, to fulfill our dreams, with patience and perseverance, a patience forever incarnated by the iconic slow-motion running on the beach, through Vangelis' divine score",10,1,1,1 August 2011
The Artist," A Masterpiece that will leave you ... Speechless ...
","«We didn't need dialogs, we had faces» said the narcissistic Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) in Billy Wilder' 'Sunset Boulevard', referring to the Silent Era, when she used to be big  before the 'pictures got small'.The reason of this introduction is that after watching Michel Hazanavicius' critically acclaimed: 'The Artist', I strongly felt this was the perfect illustration to Norma Desmond's iconic eulogy. From beginning to end, my eyes never ceased to be amazed by the communicative smile of Jean Dujardin as George Valentin, the aging silent movie star and the sparkling eyes of Berenice Bejo as Peppy Miller, the young and flamboyant starlet. Their faces occupy the screen with such an electrifying magnetism that they don't just steal the scenes, they steal the dialogs  literally.I was awestruck by Dujardin's performance. To those who didn't grew up with French TV programs, he's one of the most popular and talented comedians of his generation. Dujardin created the character of Brice de Nice, a blonde surfer whose specialty was to 'diss people', but it was so funny it never sounded mean-spirited. He was a member of a cult comic-troop (who made sketches à la SNL) but even back then, he had a little something that made him special: a voice, a smile, a charisma in both TV and movies, in both dramatic and comedic register. There was no doubt in France that the guy who was famous for his impressions of Robert De Niro and the camel (and even De Niro doing the camel) was promised to a brilliant career.Look closely at Jean Dujardin's face, it's like drawn with 'classic' features: the finely traced mustache who builds a Fairbanks-like charisma like the strength from Samson's hair, the dazzling smile making him look like the lost son of Gene Kelly, and a certain macho toughness reminding of a young Sean Connery. Dujardin's face is a gift from cinematic Gods, and 'The Artist' finally lets it glide, earning him the Cannes Festival Award for Best Actor. I sincerely believe he deserves an Oscar nomination, because he just doesn't play an actor from the Silent Era, he embodies the Era with the same level of demented craziness as Norma Desmond, in a brighter and more light-hearted side.Valentin's self-absorption echoes Desmond's cynical ego while his gaudy 'Don Lockwood' mask (Gene Kelly in 'Singin' in the Rain') hides the more poignant face of his insecurity. He's the star of the screen because only the screen allows him to express his unique talent. While Lockwood had to adapt to the 'talking' revolution, George Valentin makes a conservative U Turn starting an inexorable descent into madness, from an outcast, to a has-been until being finally alienated by his own talkie-phobia. The direction is so clever that it challenges many times our perceptions, creating unexpected feelings of discomfort when real sounds are heard. But I was surprised to see how much it worked on a dramatic level.And this is the strength of the film, although I expect it to discomfort some viewers: it isn't a tribute in the literary meaning of the word. It has its moments where it tricks us into the use of sounds or dialogs, but never fails to distract us from the core of the story: the romance. Very quickly, we forget about spotting the hints, the references to silent classics: chase scenes, over-the-top comical gesticulations, slapstick jokes etc. This mindset would disappoint those who expected a film with the same material as Mel Brook's 'Silent Movie', which was clearly a tribute. 'The Artist' IS a silent movie, featuring a beautiful romance between George and Peppy, who got her break with an idea from George, something that would make her different from the other actresses: a beauty spot above the upper lip. A clever credit-billing montage depicts her consequent ascension to stardom until she finally dethrones George and makes a has-been out of him.If I mentioned the performance of Dujardin, Berenice Bejo also deserves some accolades because she succeeded in looking so 'old' from our POV yet so fresh and modern in the film, with the appealing feel-good and optimistic attitude she constantly brings on screen. With her doll-face and youngish smile, she's like a cute little girl enjoying what she does. In a way, Peppy Miller embodies the film's most inspirational element: a positive message about passion and enjoyment. And this indirectly highlights George's source of troubles: being deprived from what he enjoyed the most and suffering from his progressive fading into oblivion. Along with this conflict, the evolution of George and Peppy's romance never feels forced, quite an accomplishment when we consider how slightly over-the-top silent movie stars used to act.Both Dujardin and Bejo are indeed powerful in an Oscar-worthy level and at that moment, I can't continue without mentioning the third character of the film, George's dog. The relationship between George and the dog provides a sort of Chaplinesque feel to the movie, a mix of tenderness and poignancy, so natural and convincing I wonder if the Academy will think of a honorary Oscar. Anyway, I applaud Hazanivicius for not having reduced 'The Artist' to a flashy spectacle with no substance, with the word 'homage' as the director's convenient alibi, and make a touching romance about two people who met each other at a pivotal time in the history of film-making, each representing a side of cinema, the old-school silent generation: Chaplin, Keaton, Pickford and the exuberant talkers: Grant, Hepburn, Davis  And I'm glad he found the true note to reconcile between these two universes at the end  didn't I tell you Dujardin was the lost son of Gene Kelly?'The Artist' plays like a missing link between 'Singin' in the Rain' and 'Sunset Boulevard' and it's indeed one of the best films of 2011, with the absence of words as an endearing 'beauty spot'.",10,292,404,14 November 2011
There's Something About Mary," We all had a 'Mary' in our life ...
","They're beautiful, they embrace life with an extraordinary optimism and wherever they come, it's like sunshine blossoming all over the place. The world is full of girls like Mary, pretty to both eyes and hearts, whose beauty never nourished a snobbish attitude that we'd have forgiven anyway. Cameron Diaz is the titular Mary, and Mary is not just a name, but a concept.We all had a Mary, a 'prettiest girl' in school, one that melted the hearts of studs and athletes as much as geeks and losers; all boys devoted their admiration for Mary like embracing an inaccessible dream. I was in love with a 'Mary' during almost ten years. Needless to say that it wasn't reciprocal, but I never cared, if she smiled at me, she'd had made my day, if she talked, I would spend one minute thinking of the best response, and if we had a date , well, only my dreams involved me as the 'lucky one'.'There's Something About Mary' is a cinematic tribute to this eternal lovely figure that either enchanted or indirectly ruined our memories.And Cameron Diaz, with her blonde hair, communicative smile and eternally positive attitude, embodied the most fascinating traits of these dream-like creatures. Her performance is perfect because she is genuinely sweet, tender and funny beyond her sexiness. She's such a good person, she even asks Ted (Ben Stiller) to be her cavalier for the prom. Granted movies have their shares of geeky escapism, but Cameron Diaz makes believable that such a girl would not feel indifferent to an awkward braces-wearing schmuck like Stiller. It's believable because these girls are so often labeled as inaccessible by average guys that no one dares to seduce them, which makes them inexperienced enough to fall for the one who tries, inviting the other adulators to come off their holes.Directed by the Farrelly Brothers, 'Mary' is about a confrontation between men who have all in common, their obsessive fascination for 'Mary'. Since, it's not a game with a win-win situation, it's up to the most sincere, the most clever or the most malicious to win her heart. And this simple premise leads to one of the funniest comedies of the 90's, a laugh riot from beginning to end. For the trivia, the film made the last Gene Siskel's Top 10 before his death in 1999, it was in the Top 10 highest-grossing movies of 1998, and holds a honorable 27th spot in the American Film Institute Top 100 comedies as the most recent film to make it in the list.And there's a reason why the film meets with such popular acclaim: it IS funny to a level of slapstick that could have only been possible in a spoof movie, which 'Mary' is not, but it's beyond labels and no gag is taken for granted, they're all pushed to their extreme limits. And for its risk-taking approach to humor, the film succeeds. Take the unfortunate 'zipper' accident that ruins what could have been Ted's life highlight (and turned out to be the whole opposite), showing the reactions of all the community was already hilarious, but the film doesn't hesitate to give us an 'explicit' idea about the state of Ted's genitals. We never know what we see exactly, but we know it might hurt like hell.After the incident, Mary moves to Florida and Ted loses touch with her, for several years and determined to find out her new whereabouts, in order to exorcise his unfulfilled obsessions, he hires Matt Dillon as a private-eye. Even more brilliant than his casting, the idea of putting this villainous old-fashioned mustache in Dillon is a stroke of genius, because only a naive guy like Ted could have trusted him. But that's what makes Stiller one of the most defining losers of the 90's, what his subsequent series of misadventures never contradict. I won't spoil all the gags, but some have already penetrated Pop-Culture forever they deserve more than a mention.Yes, I'm speaking of the infamous hair gel. Before his date with Mary, Ted's friend, played by Chris Elliot, advises him to pleasure himself, because 'the most honest moment in a man's life are the few minutes after he's blown his load - now that is a medical fact'. Kudos to the writers for such a line full of wisdom because it is true! The whole 'blowing' process is a nice gag, the mysterious disappearance of the seminal liquid, is intriguing and funny, but the final punch line is enough to give the film its ticket in the ¨Pantheon of great comedies', much more for Mary's reaction which, as silly as it is, keeps her in character, yes, she's still the well-meaning and innocent Mary.And that's the film's secret beyond its crude and raunchy humor, forgive me the cliché; it has a heart, incarnated by Mary. She's the Pandora box or Helen of Troy, inspiring her little fan-club the most deceitful ways to win her. Stiller, Dillon and Elliot are perfect, the other cast features a disabled close friend who's not totally blameless, a roommate named Magda who seemed to have spent her whole life in a UV oven, and naturally, there's no comedy without a scene-stealing animal, the dog in 'Mary' reduces the one from 'Mask' to the level of 'Benji'. There's also a weird guitarist playing the 'Greek chorus' figure, and whose final shot will be a double satisfaction for viewers, the second being the nice twist on the happy-ending, perhaps the only forgivable bit of unoriginality.But it's still funny, warm, touching in fact, there's something about 'Mary' that touches your heart, because it's still about two people learning to love each other without lying or stalking. It's all about honest love. What was wrong with these guys? They idolized Mary, and maintained their passion on a love-at-first-sight level, while it takes more to win a girl's heart, especially a girl like Mary ...",9,1,2,4 July 2013
Invictus," It's not about making people happy, but uniting them in happiness...
","FIFA World Cup just started providing its share of thrills, joys, and deceptions. While I was watching the Moroccan team yesterday, my right foot was uncontrollably trembling, my heart pounding at the national anthem and everyone was glued to the screen with the kind of frozen expression that that only Sports can draw on faces. And tough memories resurfaced, twenty years ago, we had scored three goals against Scotland in one of 'these games'; I was tying my shoes, everyone was getting ready to celebrate our qualification to the quarter finals in the street... but Brazil that had previously beat us with three goals against none, the World Champion and team of Ronaldo (bald Ronaldo, not Cristiano) lost against Norway in what should have been an open-and-shut case. A penalty kick at the last minute destroyed all hopes. My brother cried and I took off my shoes.Twenty years later, history, cruelly again, decided to repeat itself, at the last minute, in the worst possible way, one of our players scored against the team, earning Iran the precious victory and filling our hearts with bitterness. See, one can also understand the power of Sport from defeat, sport unites and brings back positive energy for a brief but exhilarating period. It also creates extraordinary bonds between people who had nothing in common except quivering for the same colors. Sports mark a truce, awakening feelings whose negative counterparts are nourished by war and political conflicts the rest of the time.Sport is essential to one country; it is essential to the world. And as I watched Clint Eastwood's 'Invictus' one day before the kick off, I felt like I could read in the mind of Nelson Mandela, played in all nuance and depth by Morgan Freeman. What an ironically fitting name for an African leader who was quite the opposite of a 'free man' for ten thousand days of his life. Indeed, some iconic artists achieved greatness and died in 27 years, for Mandela, it was the time spent in jail that allowed him to free his mind from hatred and resentment, to achieve his personal greatness through humility, forgiveness and humanity. The film starts at his release as he's cheerfully welcomed by black people while the whites expect the worst. 'End Apartheid' was the slogan that the majority of today's population wouldn't remember, not even South Africans... but the miracle happened and Mandela, Madiba as he's respectfully and affectionately called, almost rhymed with Messiah. 'Can he run a country?' asks a militant newspaper, Mandela's bodyguard sees a hate campaign but Madiba lucidly says 'it's a legitimate question', he's already approaching his role as a unifier not a divider. Coming to office, he invites the skeptical whites to stay unless they think there are irreconcilable differences, what he does is giving them a choice, a freedom, a gift only a man of his experience could value. He also hires white bodyguards and their interactions with the previous team plays like a great microcosm of the reconciliation built up throughout the film, with the power of Sports. Because 'Invictus' isn't a biography film as much as it's a Sports film. Mandela has great scopes of achievements... and failures as well, his prestige was a double-edged sword that can earn him hostility from the Afrikaners and when facing unemployment, poverty, and criminality, sports could be perceived as the least of the priorities. The genius of Mandela is to take sport damn seriously, he watches a rugby game and discovers that the Blacks support any team against the Springboks, he's booed by supporters who proudly brandish the old flag and concedes it's a constitutional right. But when he learns that the ANC is going to replace the team with a new name, new colors and hymn, he asks everyone to reconsider the vote, taking time to explain why they're wrong.Mandela wasn't just that all-smiling icon; like Gandhi, he was a natural-born leader. Warned by his secretary about the risk of losing his power, he reminds her that a true leader should be guided by his principles, not fears, he knows reconciliation is impossible without the Springboks. As much as the Whites must forget, the Blacks must forgive. It's not political but human calculation (one of the film's great quotes).
Mandela then meets the team captain François Pinaar (Matt Damon) and the two men realize they speak the same language, François always wanted victory but after his pivotal encounter, he understands that the country, hosting the 1995 World Cup, needs the victory, sports don't just make people happy; it unites them in happiness. It was twice a miracle because because South Africa had to play against the iconic All-Blacks whose haka could scare enough to guarantee a victory. 'Invictus' isn't just an underdog movie, it chronicles every single effort that made a miracle possible, because the miracle-maker was a miracle by himself. Visiting his cell, François realizes that he could touches two facing walls by simply spreading his arms. Anyone can survive 27 years of jailing, but can any soul? Mandela was the Captain of his soul as he was master of his fate and overcame his demons. 
François spreads the good word to the team, and like an apostle to a saint (but the film doesn't over-sanctify them) meetings are arranged with young Black kids from the poorer areas. And for once, they forget about soccer and learn about rugby not just from Chester, the only Black player.The team also they learn the hymn 'Schosholoza', that haunting melody that reminded me of that magical World Cup in Africa in 2014. The team had to win, and they won, the rest was history. Mandela understood the magic of Sports and used it as a political tool but a human miracle.Maybe Morocco should watch this film before their next game against Portgual... after all, it ain't over until the referee blows his whistle.",9,0,1,16 June 2018
La La Land," C'est La La Vie...
","'People love what other people are passionate about.' Being at the top of the quotes' section, I guess that statement had the most powerful resonance in the hearts of all the fools, dreamers, lovers who experienced, with amusement and amazement 'La La Land'. This is not Mia talking but Damien Chazelle, Hollywood's child prodigy, though what he did is sure no 'child's work'.Chazelle made a spectacular entrance with 'Whiplash', a spellbinding masterpiece exalting the virtues of work, passion and discipline. And by tying the Oscar-nominations record of 'Titanic' and 'All About Eve', 'La La Land' makes exactly the point of 'Whiplash', the one missed by those who label it as a 'musical', while you can enjoy it without even being impressed by the music (although I find it difficult not to be mildly haunted by that score from Justin Hurwitz, a melody echoing the work of Michel Legrand and that doesn't get off the head easily).'Here's to the fools who dream'.'La La Land' follows the ups-and-downs of a romance between Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) a pianist as passionate about jazz as J.K. Simmons in 'Whiplash' (Simmons has a small part) and Mia (Emma Stone), a struggling actress stuck in Cinderella-phase, working in a Hollywood cafeteria with a string of auditions' failures that severely undermined her self-confidence. And while it's easier for pianists to find jobs, Seb is a purist who can't stand selling his soul for pop music or any modernized, youth-appealing, version of jazz.But there's no villain in 'La La Land' except for reality and its necessary compromises. Together, Mia and Seb find the motivation to achieve their dreams. Seb works with a band lead by Keith, an old friend played by John Legend, so he can provide for Mia while she writes a one-woman-show, and stops relying on auditions. It is very telling that she wants to be an actress and he a jazz pianist, Mia must learn how to act, and not surrender to defeatism, while Seb has got to play the game, and as Keith says 'not try to revolutionize something by being traditional'. The irony is that while they try to reach happiness, they're happy and have the time of their life.'Life is what happens to you while you're making projects'.Chazelle doesn't share John Lennon's view of happiness, his vision follows the same pattern than 'Whiplash', to the point I wondered if Chazelle wasn't the kind of workaholic guy who decided one day that he had to dedicate 100% of his time to movie-making at the expenses of love comfort. It seems like you can see his personal story behind his work and I feel that it's for this sincerity, that he's one of these artists who peak very early like Scorsese or Tarantino. Now, I know I could go on the stylish directing and the whole love letter to Hollywood but this is one aspect that I'm less hot about.The first sunny and enthusiastic dance sequence was nothing but a masterpiece of choreographic directing and time will tell if it becomes as iconic as the beginning of 'West Side Story' but personally, I was not impressed... in the sense that I felt it was Chazelle begging for the Oscar, especially since the scene doesn't stop after the music and the film goes on. It was remarkable but in such a showy way it felt too Oscar-baity for its own good. But Chazelle is a jazzy director: he knows when to over-bake it and when to play it smooth. So, I let myself transported by the film and at the Planetarium sequence, I was literally transported by the poetry of the moment, like 'what the heck' this is good, give the film the awards it deserves.Yes, 'La La Land' is stylish and you can see the director and writer's touches of unpredictability everywhere, in the backgrounds, in the use of phone calls, even the title is a clever bit of creativity, this is one of these cases where the directing is in symbiosis with the story, like in Scorsese's movie. And rightfully so because the story isn't even revolutionary and we've seen it a thousand times but it's in the storytelling and that magnificent 'rewriting' third act. The finale redeemed the slower second act and echoed how many feel about life: you can succeed through money, love and dreams, you're happy if you get two out of three. By that logic, Mia and Seb are happy at the end, but indulge to a fantasy sequence where they succeed in everything.And as dreamy as it was, the 'fantasy' sequence was still plausible... had they engaged in a transparent, sincere and flawless relationship from the start. But who said life was flawless? I spend my whole life rewriting my story and asking myself: 'what if I had done this or that?', it's never totally unrealistic, but that's the whole fantasy aspect about it, when you know what awaited you, it's easier to look at your past in retrospect. You only realize your mistakes when it's you late, otherwise, you wouldn't call them mistakes. And well, five years later, they still have good reasons to smile despite the wasted opportunities, because when you sacrifice love for dreams, the lost love becomes the dream. C'est la la vie! Finally Speaking of life, this is my 1000th review, I'm sad that IMDb is shutting down the message boards and wanted a feel-good movie for the occasion. Yet I felt cheated, because Chazelle doesn't go for sentimentality at the end as romantic and deliberately kitsch as it was, 'La La Land' is true to life because it has a little twist called reality. I don't know if I feel so good after all I feel good in the way this film made me feel about life... but maybe I wanted the dream, after all.",8,5,11,15 February 2017
The Last Samurai," Watanabe the warrior-poet, a man of conservation... and conversations...
","In Kurosawa movies, what characterized Samurais was that were both men of action and men from a bygone time as if fighting could only draw the future with the ink of the past. Samurais were the last embodiments of a heritage whose relevance was fading at the dawn of modernity. Maybe that awareness forged their resignation for death for only dishonor they feared. The men lived and perished by the sword, whomever it came from.But remember in 'Seven Samurai', four of the warriors fell under fired bullets, deaths that actually dishonored the enemy but also marked the beginning of the end. In 'The Last Samurai', it's not a few bullets but gatling guns that annihilate the glorious but suicidal ride of the last Shogun warriors, including their leader Katsumoto, played by Ken Watanabe, a composite of many historical figures; supposedly the last Samurai. Still, the film has no pretension to be true to history, but to a philosophy that forged Japan's history for centuries and that more or less prevailed even after the reforms.'The Last Samurai' was directed by Edward Zwick, the name might not ring a bell, he was the director of 'Glory' in 1989. And as much as 'Glory' wasn't about fighting in the Civil War but the idea of fighting for a cause worth dying for, 'The Last Samurai' also questions the virtues of fighting by confronting two different approaches of warfare, two philosophies of life. It does so with such a contemplative patience that we realize the Western and Oriental civilizations have a lot in common. Or might it be that every civilization built its definition of honor in a way that only a battlefield could give that abstract word its fullest meaning? Is it a blessing or a curse, history provides arguments for both sides, but where does the film stand?It's interesting that the most riveting scenes in the film involve sacrifices, as to show that there was a greater nobility in losing for a just cause than winning. But the film's hero Nathan Algren, Civil War and Indian wars veteran, doesn't start with that mindset. He survived the infamous Little Big Horn massacre and saw Custer's madness killing thousands of Natives. Yet for all the atrocities Algren witnessed, maybe what he resented was the idea that men like Custer were capable to draw other men to their cause in all blind loyalty, history would prove that good causes didn't have the monopoly of sacrifices. and that's a thought-provoking issue the film raises.Ironically, when Algren tells Katsumoto that Custer was 'a murderer who fell in love with his own legend. And his troopers died for it.', the warrior-poet responds it's a 'very good death'. The Samurai is so impregnated by the idea of dying rather than living in shame that anyone accepting the necessity of death is worth admiration. That's not exactly how winning is done but when you follow Katsumoto, you find out life isn't about the cause but about its guidance to find your own truth. When we first see Algren, he's an alcoholic, bitter and war-weary man, channeling a 'Ron Kovic' version of the Civil War vet but later, after a long immersion into the traditional Japan, he gains wisdom and a deeper and more balanced vision of things.The film takes place in 1878, during the Meiji era that turned the old feudal Japan into an industrialized country and an Imperialist nation in the turn of the century. The young Emperor (Shichinosuke Nakamura) is confronted to a rebellion from Samurais who reject the new order for the nation's own good though Katsumoto would die for the Emperor if he ordered him so. Japan seeks help from the U.S. Army and so Algren can leave his existential dead-end and train the fresh new Japanese troops under the supervision of Captain Bagley (Tony Goldwyn) his previous commanding officer, a wannabe Custer who despises the savagery of the Orient as much as he did with Natives. He finds an ally in Omura (Masata Harado), a wealthy Westernized industrial and corrupt bureaucrat who takes advantage from the Emperor's age to influence his decisions and allow the U.S artillery to wipe out the Samurai rebellion.So the film is driven by two contrasting moves: Japanese politicians emulating the Western world, and Algren rediscovering the Japanese tradition and within it a salvation for his own soul, as if he could exorcise the very demons that stained America's history and march toward progress, the very one that inspired the Meiji. He owes his survival for his tenacity during a one-to-one fight, won in-extremis, raising the interest of Katsumoto who wants to study the stranger. Watanebe was rightfully Oscar-nominated for a quiet but intense performance as a man in constant quest for truth, not victory, a righteous man who'd die with honor in a lost battle against the tides of history.The film is filled with spectacular fighting sequences but is at its most absorbing during the quiet and introspective moments, when we see Algren's gradual immersion into Japan's roots, learning the language and the art of Kendo, befriending Katsumoto's son, falling in love with his sister Taka (the beautiful Koyuki Kato) whom husband he killed and in an honorable duel. The film doesn't overplay the nobility and righteousness of the Japanese and makes Katsumoto an accessible fellow, with wit and humor, and his 'conversations' with Cruise provide the best moments and raise intriguing but deep philosophical questions about fights and causes.Near the end, the film seems to give in to Hollywood spectacle requirements, the only aspect Roger Ebert criticized but I don't think it ever betrayed the film's soul. And it's not in every movie that you see soldiers respectfully bowing down to the fighters they just killed as if deep inside, they knew it was a page of history that was just turned, and turned Japan to a modern country with all the best to come... and the worst, too.",8,1,10,8 November 2019
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," Oops! They did it again...
","Kevin is lost again, this time not in the house, but in the airport. It's a progress but seriously, what were the odds? Not too low when you consider the premise of a sequel making loads of money and capitalizing on the first opus' popularity.But box-office considerations put aside, what's to think about the film? I guess it all comes down to one thing: someone who loves 'Home Alone' will appreciate the sequel (subtitled 'Lost in New York') because it didn't take too much distance from the original format. And someone who disliked the first opus will probably hate this one even more. The other possibility is to appreciate the first for its nostalgic value and while not denying that the second is a 90's comedy classic (as a continuation of the first), it's possible to have a few reservations.'Lost in New York' reminds me of another sequel: 'Gremlins 2', the same premise in the Big Apple setting, with little Gizmo as the same heartwarming leitmotif as Christmas in 'Home Alone'. But 'Gremlins 2' was also notable for its change of tone and pace, compared with the original, too many goofy Gremlins and zany jokes made the film closer to a parody than a direct continuation. I believe 'Home Alone 2' did the same, it really is over-the-top and goofier than the first (which says a lot) but it also displays an overdose of schmaltz and sappiness and in a weird and sneaky way, it does create some bizarre balance in the end.The problem of 'Home Alone 2' is that the film is really capable of mocking its own material in a edgy way, but these brilliant moments get drowned in an ocean of syrupy sentimentality and cartoon-like violence. When after losing their black sheep of a kid again, the parents go to the Police, they almost break into laughter when they say 'at least we didn't lose one luggage', it's funny in a hilarious Simpson-like way because it's like they concede how awful their parenting is and it's so tragic it's actually risible. That was a hilarious moment. But there aren't many unfortunately as John Hughes, who wrote the script, was busier trying to recycle the original plot.That would have been fine of course, especially the premise of a kid like Kevin, again brilliantly played by Macaulay Culkin, to spend some vacation in the most prestigious hotel in New York (and meet future President Trump). And when the staff is composed of Tim Curry, Dana Ivey (and even Rob Schneider) you know it's going to be fun. But there's a fine line between funny and ludicrous that the film crosses too many times even within the screwball universe it got us used to. I have a hard time believing that Curry would mistake an inflatable clown for a man. It's not a matter of contrivance but awkwardness, when the 'old movie' shtick works again and the man on TV mentions 'Cliff' and there's a staff member named the same, that's a contrivance that pays off.Another moment of brilliance was the confrontation between the parents and the staff, 'What kind of idiots do you have working here?' 'The finest in New York City!' replies Dana Ivey with a triumphant smile in Curry and Schneider's faces, not realizing the joke is on them and when the confrontations ends with a slap on his face, you can almost taste the tear in Curry's eyes. When a writer is capable of such subtly funny moments, you regret that the film followed the same formula as the first and push it to most extreme levels. The best parts are all in the first part of the film, after that, it just goes too far for its own good.I love a Good Christmas story but talk about overplaying it. All right, Kevin has a poignant conversation with a toy store owner who happens to have the same growl than James Stewart, it was so sappy I thought it would be revealed at the end that this guy was Santa Klaus. I understand the toy shop was pivotal to set up the final act and the moment with the kid is in the hospital important to establish that Kevin was mischievous but with a golden heart. Now, did we need that Bird Lady? Brenda Ficker plays 'Shovel Man' counterpart very well but that exchange about the meaning of heart and all was quite overwritten. I couldn't believe Kevin would say that after what he said to his mother, and before what he did to Harry and Marvin.Speaking of them, yes, they're the bad guys all right, we get it. But they undergo so much pain that I found the confrontation very hard to watch. In the first film, the house tricks lasted less than twenty minutes, it's almost twice longer in the sequel and they get the full treatment: bricks thrown from a hundred feet high, ropes soaked with kerosene, electrocution, and always that annoying sliding before falling on their back. Whoever told Hughes that seeing a man falling on his back was funny, it's cringe-worthy at best and no matter how bad they are, it really plays like a disproportionate retribution.
I know I'm reading too much, but there's another fine line between getting their comeuppance and being victim of a sadistic little brat that the film doesn't cross, it flies over it. Marvin screaming with the spider on his face was funny, seeing him scream in a Hitchcok's 'Birds' remake was quite painful to watch. 'Home Alone 2' is fun and entertaining but the last part recycles the original's bits by overplaying their effect, sometimes I felt the sentimentality was like the bricks thrown at our face and the violence toward Harry and Marv made me feel more sorry for her than any bird lady or hospital kid.",7,1,3,22 December 2017
Life Is Beautiful," When sometimes, it's worth risking losing life not to lose the very faith in life ...
","'Life is Beautiful' divide opinions in the most extreme ways, either you love or hate it. It's famous or infamous for having depicted the 'Holocaust' from the perspective of a father who wants to get the Nazi atrocities off the sight of his five-year old son, Josue. Guido would pretend that everything is a game, and Nazis only rhyme with baddies which Josue must hide from and follow his Dad's instructions to win the 1000-point prize: a real tank.We live the horror of the concentration camp from both Guido and Josue's point of view in a bittersweet duality of death and life, sorrow and smile, survival and fun. It's certainly the gutsiest screenplay ever written for the parallel it traced between one of the most horrifying historical events and its translation as a game. And I can't understand why many people fail to ignore the point of Guido's actions. I love what Ebert said about the film: if Guido had weapons, he would have shot the enemy, if he had an Army, he would have wipe the Nazis out  but all he had is what his Ancestors called in Latin, 'Vis Comica' (comical force). The film divides and is divided in two parts. The first is set during Italy's fascist days where we meet in a sunny and joyful ambiance a modern clown named Guido Orefice (Roberto Benigni), a character that immediately touches your heart, a man with a communicative appetite for life and laughs: the epitomes of his personal philosophy wonderfully conveyed by Nicola Piovani's score. The delightful lightness of life resonates like Nino Rota's music from Fellini's neo-realistic period. The whole film carries many references to Italian cinema's heritage, the sight of Guido and Dora (Nicoletta Braschi) romantically riding the bike reminds of Rizzi and his wife in the 'Bicycle Thief' -when the bicycle meant new hopes for the Family- and like De Sica's masterpiece, the film's second part focuses on a poignant father-and-son relationship.'La Vita e Bella': even the title is a sort of emphasis on 'La Dolce Vita', as if sweet was too feeble a word to describe the inner value of life. Indeed, it takes some real genius to embrace life with such a never-ending optimism, Guido is the perfect antidote against the venomous effect of desperation and he's so convincing that he manages to seduce the beautiful Dora (Nicoletta Braschi), promised to marry a Fascist civil servant... until Guido comes and takes her away like a Charming Prince. The whole first act has the feeling of a fairy tale where we discover Guido, his uncle Eliseo and his German Doctor friend with whom he likes to play riddles. The film begins with a comedic triumph that consecrates Benigni as a modern Chaplin, with the foreshadowing of coming tears when we learn that Guido is Jewish.The change of mood from the second act is so abrupt that it accentuates the feeling of discomfort. Cinematically speaking, 'Schindler's List'' is a superior film but we expect a movie with dark and unbearable scenes, we're like mentally prepared. In 'Life is Beautiful', it catches us off-guard: after so many laughs, there is a long dramatic transition that even Guido's admirable nerves can't hide. We all know what would happen to Uncle Eliseo when he goes to the 'shower', and the moment when he prevents the Nazi woman officer from falling creates a tragically ironic situation. In the Camp's women section, a little gray cat goes around a pile of women's clothes lying on the floor while he was held earlier by a little girl on the trunk that send the Jews to the train station ...That part is difficult to watch and we're almost glad when laughs are back, when Guido translates the instructions barked by a fat Nazi officer: pure comedic genius! We prefer to see the horror from Josue's view not as a denial, but as a ferocious attachment to the idea of no matter the adversity we face and hardship we endure, while there's life, there's hope; and Josue is the incarnation of this hope for Guido. And when Guido meets the German doctor and tries to seek his help in the Camp, the Doctor's answer leaves Guido shocked and appalled. His face of disbelief is the proof, that Guido is not acting as a clown, all his smiles, games and plays are for Josue.It's all about Josue indeed, and it's certainly with him in mind that Dora, though a gentile, sacrificed her freedom for the camp. In of these ironical twists, Guido would lose his life by trying to find Dora, and knowing his son is watching him, he walks in a comical way before being shot off-screen, off Josue's sight, the gunshots were one of the most disturbing sounds I've ever heard in a film. The day after, Josue would finally win the tank and find his mother; his scream of joy in his Dora's arm is not just the triumph of Guido's sacrifice, but the triumph of hope. And God how I cried in that scene  Why do some clever users seem eager to shortcut their emotional reactions in the name of cold rationalism? I'm less questioning their intelligence than their ability to think beyond their intelligence. After all, when the same side says 'Not another movie about the Holocaust!' and 'The movie trivializes (or sugarcoats) the Holocaust', maybe we should consider that the greatness of Roberto Benigni's Oscar-winning film relies somewhere between these two interpretations. To challenge Guido's legendary optimism and faith in life, 'Life is Beautiful' needed one hell of a tragedy.'A picture with a smile-and perhaps, a tear.' said a too modest Chaplin about his masterpiece 'The Kid'. And after watching 'Life is Beautiful', no matter how many smiles, how many laughs and how many tears Roberto Benigni expected me to experience I know I lost track.",10,2,4,17 November 2011
Up," Air of Dreams...
","I see some spiritual connections between Pete Docter's 'Up' and 'Field of Dreams', both about men who missed opportunities for reality's sake before embarking in fantastic eye-opening experiences and coming to terms with their past. And both have this daringness of scripts starting with real people living real situations, yet never shaking our belief that the impossible can happen, former baseball players coming from heaven or hundreds and hundreds of colored balloons taking a house to the most remote place of the world, somewhere in South America. But there's more in 'Up' than the adventure of a cranky old man and a little kid; by the time, the house takes off, literally, we already handled more emotionality than all the previous Pixar movies put together, and this is what makes this sight so rewarding, so relieving after the unforgettable prologue. Indeed, if there is one sequence from 2009 that became an instant classic, and you better believe it will still be in twenty years, it's the magnificent marital-life montage sequence, sublimated by Michael Giacchino's Oscar-winning score. It all starts with Carl as a little bespectacled boy idolizing adventurer Charles Muntz and dreaming to join him in the Lost Word to admire the Paradise Falls. On his way home, he meets Ellie, a free-spirited little girl who talks for two, the two kids share the same dreams.And the magic of 'Up' is to convey messages through simple visuals, Carl meets Ellie when losing his balloon, he gets to the hospital by trying to get it, she then sends it back with a little gift tied to it, so Carl and Ellie's love story is constantly associated with balloons, and Carl's job as a balloon vendor might be the humblest way to emulate his hero's zeppelin. So Carl and Ellie get married and from the clouds they gaze at, they form exotic creatures, symbols of their escapist dreams. Reality slowly fades in and starts to inspire such forms as toddlers, unfortunately, the couple can't. Then they decide to save money for their travel, putting nickels and dimes in a jar, but life always find a way: a flat tire, a roof destruction, ordinary hazards postpone then erase the dream. Only love hasn't been tarnished by the passing of time, but the tragedy of such couples is that one ought to live some time. So Ellie finally dies, leaving Carl alone with his memories their house.This is a marvel of storytelling, no words or lyrics, only a musical theme to complete a sequence whose timeless and universal appeal is comparable to the ending of 'City Lights', because I refuse to believe there's anyone in this world who can't relate to Carl and Ellie, and even if you watched the scene with cynicism-tainted glasses and thought their life was boring, in a later scene, the little kid says something like 'funny how we remember the most boring stuff'. This line sums up everything, Carl had a happy life with Ellie, and it's all up to him to make the rest of his life as happy. I think it was John Lennon who said that life was what happened to us while we're busy making plans, well this totally applies to Carl, certainly one of the most fascinating characters of Pixar, I want to say, if only for the fact that he's an old man, and that the villain (voiced by Christopher Plummer) is even older.Their age is important because the two men have one thing in common, they're prisoners of their past, naturally each one finds a different way to fight the demons. Carl's present was Ellie, once she was dead, he couldn't connect with anything related to his time, only living in a world of memories and dusty pictures, even keeping the little house from the estate investors who want to buy him out. Carl categorically refuses until the day he hits a worker and then is forced to put in retirement home, losing his only remaining link with the past. Carl is left with no other choice than project himself into the future and what more glorious than the one he always prepared with Ellie. So, using all the balloons he could collect during years of services, he takes his house to the air.The movie gets a bit more conventional once the house picks off, featuring some magnificent locations, high mountains with oddly flat summits, oddly shaped rocks and oddly colored creatures, towering over the tropical jungles, so high and so remote that no human ever set the foot there. And beyond the escapism, there is this eternal love story that drives Carl, and there's the little kid, an Asian overweight scout who starts like a comic relief until you see he has a few things in common with Carl besides the fact that both act realistically, according to their age. Russell's dream is to get the 'Assist the Elderly' badge and to spend more time with his Dad, the fact that he calls his mother by her first name might be a hint that he's an adopted orphan. Russell is like the total opposite of Carl, it's the absence of love that makes his banal dream impossible, while Carl had all the love he needed and that's what made his extraordinary dream possible.Carl and Russell's journey isn't devoid of humor, an exotic bird and a bunch of robotic dogs provide some laughs, but the story ultimately works because we genuinely care for the characters. There aren't many but that allows them to have more realism, texture and personality than any other standard animated character. And this is integral to the story's appeal as it invites us to reconsider our life and what we call failures, to make us forgive our mistakes and embrace the future with more optimism, and as 'Up''s ending suggests, the ground can be as a great field of dreams as the air.",9,0,1,30 June 2016
A Clockwork Orange," It's not about trivialization of violence but the exhilaration of freedom ...
","'A Clockwork Orange' is the exhilarating journey in the twisted mind of an unrepentant(?) bastard for whom fun is synonym of ultra-violence, sex of rape, and beauty of Ludvig Van's music. This is a masterpiece of self-aware depravity highlighting our very hypocrisy towards violence. We all are pointing our fingers on Alex De Large because we don't have the decent honesty to reckon there's something absolutely magnetic in this character. I admit it, I liked Alex De Large, and I loved 'A Clockwork Orange', the movie that told me how bad a man I could virtually become. I'm a good person as society labeled me, but inside, deep in my soul, there's a little something that commanded my brain to be fascinated by Alex De Large.
Still, when I question my own gut reaction to Kubrick's masterpiece, I realize that the most instinctive answer I can give you is that the movie relaxed my very approach to violence or to whatever stink can exude from the darkest sides of my soul. Yes, I enjoyed the movie in the most vicious way. Watching Alex De Large's hypnotic grin while he was driving the Durango with his droogies, I felt like smashing to pieces this computer I'm typing on and go for an old ride of ultra-violence myself. Where? why? I don't know, nor do I feel guilty. In fact, I just feel Alex was a dangerous but no less vivid incarnation of a society deprived of morality. Some might call it dystopia but I don't think we're that far from this model where violence pleases the eyes. Look on TV, check on the Internet, ask yourself why you're fascinated by the spectacle of violence? Despite a dated futuristic setting, the movie was ahead of its time, and a milestone in its detached and decadent depiction of evil.
The young hero is indeed one of the most despicable characters ever portrayed, he beats, rapes, kills with a profound disdain toward humanity compensated by a passionate love for one of its most distinguished representatives: Beethoven. Alex loves his snake as he loves himself, selfishly, carrying all the characteristics of the sociopath, he's genuinely evil and yet he's the most memorable characters of Kubrick's rich filmography. I tried to figure why, and I think after viewing this film multiples times, I came up to the following conclusion: this young hero is a villain who becomes a victim, a passive character allowing us to feel sorry for him. And that's why we forgive ourselves for loving this movie, because it turns the almighty bad to a pitiful being. Or maybe there's more to it.Indeed, Kubrick's film confronts us to our own vileness by condemning vice or violence when we do find a part of them useful and fun. Another example, while we condemn deviant sex, which of us wouldn't dream of making it with two beautiful girls in the same bed, with Rossini's iconic William Tell overture score pumping his muscles? Alex's decadence is the yang of our boring yin, and if this detached violence can inspire our most sadistic impulses, curing these impulses by associating violence with nauseous sensations is another form of violence confirming the point that victims are not necessarily virtuous ... and that's the crucial subtlety, otherwise, the film would have been just a vast operatic masquerade made by a skillful director just to impress easily impressionable viewers.Think: what kind of dirty mind would be fascinated by a movie where the character acts so shockingly violent, with a hypnotic music in the background and a beautiful cinematography, where is blood? Where are the broken tooth? Where are the shouts, the cries? And where's that violence that Kubrick feigns to shows but covers with dazzling aesthetics, creating a hypnotic yet dangerously appealing violence? In other words, where is the real violence? the answer is: after the iconic Ludovico treatment. In fact, it even starts with the Ludovico treatment, where Alex is confronted to horrific off-screen images of violence and becomes sick and nauseous, when he sees images of the concentration camps mixed with the music of Ludvig Van. The irony is that we never see those so called frightening images, it's all suggested, but the reaction is so believable thanks to Malcolm McDowell's amazing performance, we feel for him.But again, the only violence portrayed in a non aesthetic way and rather sadistic way is when Alex De Large gets his comeuppance. When he hits someone, it look choreographed, when he kills the lady, it's off-screen, the rape scene almost looks like a perverse musical number, but when Alex gets it, he gets it. A knock in the nuts, a spit in the face, the most realistic I've ever seen, it disgustingly hits him in the lips, the beating by the bums, the drowning by his ex-friends, the whole Beethovenian torture. Alex becomes such a sympathetic character we feel the punishment disproportionate, forgetting the atrocities he's committed. Why?Because it's not about the trivialization of violence, which is the most tempting and superficial conclusion, but about the exhilaration of freedom, especially, freedom of will. It's Alex' will to be a better man, to improve, but it's against his will to endure a medical torture that will deprive him from the ability to choose any of the good or the bad path. Being conditioned to follow the right path is a remedy worse than the sickness hence the stylistic difference. It's just as if violence was a pervert yet defining embodiment of our freedom from the way Kubrick magnifies it on screen which makes his accusation of desensitization wrong, the film turns violence into something ugly, but the one with the fascistic and brainwashing undertones because it destroys something even worse than the body, our freedom of will. Kubrick doesn't 'excuse' violence but emphasizes freedom.I stop now: reaching the genius of the script would be like Alex trying to grab these girl's beautiful boobs",10,1,4,14 February 2011
Groundhog Day," When tomorrow is not necessarily another day ...
","'Groundhog Day' is one of the best films of 1993, and essentially works as a comedic relief in a year characterized by heavy dramas such as 'Schindler's List', 'The Piano' or 'Philadelphia'. It's also an incredible achievement on the writing department with one of the most creatively ingenuous plot devices : having a man living the same day, over and over again. As usual, the thin frontier between simplicity and genius provides, in the comedy genre, a goldmine for gags and humorous situations, mostly based on the comedy of repetition. But, there's no better comedy than a comedy with a heart, and Harold Ramis wrote us a heart-warming story of a man, re-examining his life, through an endless series of chaotic, tender, hilarious or dramatic situations.

Reservoir Dogs," These 'Dogs' bark a lot, but they bite, too ...
","Bloodily violent, irreverently shocking, politically incorrect, inventively funny and so on and so forth I'm trying to find the right expression to describe 'Reservoir Dogs' and I finally got it, it stands in three letters: N-E-W. There was something waiting in the abyssal wombs of cinema, so repressed it was waiting for deliverance with a fierce impatience, a deliverance with a quite original and cool-sounding name: Quentin Tarantino, the new incarnation of modern violence with STYLE. 'Reservoir Dogs' is more than a debut; it's a sensational entrance that consecrated Tarantino among the most influential directors of his generation, and THE reference in independent film-making.Tarantino invented a new style that would never desert his films, and would make each of his creation, the epitome of coolness. It's so fresh to watch 'Reservoir Dogs' now and to realize how new it was at that time. I remember the first time I watched the film, I was 17, and the movie literally blew me away in every single aspect, and I guess the fact that I wasn't familiar with the Internet or IMDb was a good thing since it didn't intercede with my approach of the film. I didn't want to know what's so cool about Tarantino, I just discovered him with his film, shortly after watching 'Pulp Fiction', and for some reason, I loved 'Reservoir Dogs' a little more. Tarantino quickly became my favorite director as a teenager, and in my early 20's because of this level of creativity in the writing, the directing, and the editing.The writing is Tarantino's trademark and his greatest quality, the movie starts with a whole discussion about the meaning of 'Like a Virgin' told by a fast-speaking Tarantino, himself as Mr. Brown, then a whole debate starts about tipping and non tipping. That's the question raised by the first minutes of 'Reservoir Dogs' and the least we could say is that the talk is so trivial it sounds real and authentic in its rawness and makes the characters more human, if not sympathetic. More generally, the whole characterization is driven by dialogs so delicately vulgar you never miss the action, or wait for something 'to happen'. Script 'happens' in Tarantino's films, like meals you've already eaten but with a new special taste, something juicy, creamy, and spicy. It's almost an indigestion of creativity  I don't need to tell you the lines, if I start them, you know the rest : 'You shoot me in a dream ', 'Are you gonna bark all day, little doggie?' etc. etc. And these dogs not only bark, but they do bite a lot.Indeed, if the movie was all dialogs, it wouldn't have had the same impact. It's like Tarantino already knew his lesson, and wanted to make something big, from the beginning. From the iconic slo-mo walking scene down the alley with the opening credits, you get the idea that this 'Little Green Bag' song will be the 'hallelujah' glorifying the birth of a new style of film-making, and instinctively, you know something special will happen after these credits, and you're not disappointed by what follows. Blood, blood all over the car seat, and probably one of the most convincing painful screams ever. You really can feel for Tim Roth in that scene, it's like the real actor got one real bullet, and the rest is the touching expression of a growing friendship between Roth as Mr. Orange, and Mr. White, his mentor played by Harvey Keitel. He combs his hear, whispers something that provoke Orange's cute but heartbreaking smile: the chemistry is so believable, you understand that the movie is not just about cool dialogs. Then, comes Mr Pink as Steve Buscemi, asking who the rat is! Because this is the first serious element we have. It's the story of a botched jewel robbery, with a traitor among these gangsters. This question will be the starting point of the narrative with three specific back stories told in flashback.The three characters depicted in flashback are Mr. White, Mr. Orange, and Michael Madsen as Mr. Blonde. And in the memorable-action department, the winner is undoubtedly Mr. Blonde: the one who provided the most iconic and recognizable moment of the film. The iconic ear-cutting scene with the 'Stuck In the Middle With You' music, like a reminiscence of 'A Clockwork Orange' rape scene with 'Singin' in the Rain' as a musical background, the scene is disturbing, violent, bloody, but also  iconic. The violence is not meant to be cool, but just to show how psychotic Mr. Blonde, one of the most twisted gangster villains, is. And his torture is also crucial because it will unmask Mr. Orange as the snitch, and will make his relationship with White, even more complex. In one minute, the movie raises a new dimension, deeper and more tragic.Forget the cool and raunchy dialogs, the creative editing, where flashbacks interfere with parallel stories, as when we witness a great scene where Orange tells a story within another story. Too many insertions as to create a confusing feeling until the last iconic scene : after the slo-mo opening, the ear-cutting, the Mexican stand-off, as the last memorable scene that would lurch this movie into Pop Culture. Forget the wonderful ensemble cast with so many colorful characters (literally) and such believable actions and reactions like childishly arguing about nicknames instead of preparing a serious job. All these elements are great, but it would have been nothing without the tragedy  The beauty of the film relies on this profound relationship between Mr. Orange and Mr White, made of respect and honor, and the last minute of the film was something that reminded of Peckinpah's films, a moment of honesty and loyalty, incarnated by Orange's last confession, and White's heartbreaking gesture as to redeem the act of a man he still loved as friend  Keitel's last look before the movie ends will haunt me forever.",10,20,23,9 May 2011
The Wind that Shakes the Barley," The Fratricidal collision between Idealism and Pragmatism...
","'The Wind That Shakes the Barley', first of the two Golden Palm winners directed by Ken Loach, starts in the kind of cinematically traditional fashion that doesn't prepare you for how innovative it is on an intellectual basis. Yes, intellectual.Young lads are playing hockey on a field so richly green you wouldn't believe it's anywhere outside the Emerald Isle. After the game, a heartfelt exchange of farewells between Damien O'Donovan and the O'Sullivan clan is interrupted by the fierce intervention of the infamous 'Black and Tans'. The troop came to remind that collective demonstrations are severely prohibited and that went for sports game too. What follows is no game at all.Things escalate quickly when one of these young Irishmen, too angry or maybe too proud to measure up the danger decides not to cooperate at all. He says his name in Gaelic and keeps his eyes and chin up with a defiant smirk that earns him a 'permanent' beating. That martyrdom is still not enough to convince young promising doctor Damien O'Donovan (brilliantly played by Cillian Murphy) to swell the ranks of the fighters, among them his older brother Teddy (Padraic Delaney) against the British colons. We're all aware that in cinema's tradition it's not uncommon for the most valiant fighters to start as outsiders or even be labeled as cowards but Ken Loach doesn't use these narrative conventions at the expenses of realism. The episode that ends up triggering Damien's determination doesn't consist on another life-threatening situation yet it is far less than being anecdotic. On the train station, he sees the driver named Dan (Liam Cunnigham) being brutalized by British soldiers because he refused to transport them, nothing to do with Irish pride but union rights forbidding him to transport weapons.This is interesting in the way it establishes the real motivations of Damien, he's not driven by romanticism but realism, and these nuances will play a gradually important role as the story progresses. Meanwhile, Ken Loach exposes the familiar elements such as the training of the troops, the first successful operations, the first sheds of blood with an attention to details that make each operation believable and heart-pounding in their unpredictable outcome. The performance of Murphy is crucial because we always identify with his outsider's status while his involvement gets deeper and his initial persona progressively diluted in the painful obligations. There was a 1969 movie named 'Army of Shadows' depicting with an eerie realism the existential corners a fight against occupation drove some ordinary men: executing a traitor with a towel, resigning to swallow a cyanide capsule or even worse, dying in total anonymity without any posthumous recognition whatsoever. But for all its grittiness, the movie didn't leave any doubt about the righteousness of the fight lead by French civilians for the enemy was the Nazi occupants, if it didn't make any death satisfying, we knew everyone did the 'right thing' even when it meant the worst.Now, you have 'The Wind That Shakes the Barley', a movie all in bright palettes of green, nothing to do with the gray shadowy streets of Melville's masterpiece, but if this film that starts like your typical exhilaration of the fight for freedom, there is slowly but surely, in a way that credits Ken Loach' respect for his viewers, a gradual existential questioning. In a scene that echoes the traitor's execution in 'Shadows', Damien must shoot the friend who denounced them. At this point, you can see that it's a part of himself he's killing with the poor frightened kid and that there's no return to normality after that. Indeed, we've seen sickening scenes of torture before, we know how violent the British were, but the film still allows his main protagonist to hope that Ireland will be worth the fight, this is no 'Braveheart''. The execution is a poignant moment but what goes next is a triumph of writing and self-questioning. It consists on a long discussion about a verdict forcing a rich Irish man to pay a poor woman back because of high interest rates, this is the first judgment rendered by an independent Irish court but many fighters, including Damien's brother refuses to ostracize the richer ones as they're the most important fundraisers.We can see the first breeches of discord within the group, some believe the fight needs money, some that the power must be given to the people. And what we've got here is a film that asks two questions: is the fight worth it after all, since it makes you kill your own people? Or will it be worth it since it will keep the same system just under a different flag. The question becomes crucial after the partition of Ireland and its dominion status maintained, causing a permanent shift between Loyalists and Nationalists and culminating when a man is forced to execute his own brother, remaking the very moment where Damien killed the traitor. Damien would recall the memory to point out that there's no possible bargain with him.Damien's views seem politically motivated and Ken Loach was criticized for injecting his left-wing views within the story, but there's no doubt that there was starvation in Ireland and that a real ideological shift occurred within the fighters. And it says a lot about the misleading exhilaration of 'fighting' when you believe in one enemy before you discover that it can be within your own nation, your own blood. There's a moment where the Loyalists mention that Britain needs to save face not to encourage other countries like India. At the end, I kept thinking of India and the sad aftermath of Gandhi's fight for the Independence with the Muslims and Hindus' civil war.British criticized Ken Loach's self-loathing approach, in fact, he does justice to the two sides by confronting them to their historical responsibility, through a tragedy echoing a powerful line from another Golden Palm winner, Kusturica's 'Underground': 'a war is not a war until the brother kills his brother'.",9,4,5,7 February 2018
Total Recall," So much better than 'Inception'...
","A film like Verhooven's 'Total Recall' is the ultimate proof that it doesn't take a brochette of the most 'in' and bankable stars, an overdose of digital effects or different exotic locations Ã  la James Bond to convince the audience they got it worth the price of their ticket and their butter pop-corn box. Story-wise, you don't need a 'serious' underacting hero, you know with the emotional scar in his heart, the 'mysterious' spot of a haunting past that keeps drawing a constipated deadpan look. You don't need some gimmicky symbolism or a juxtaposition of universes, to make an entertaining AND intelligent AND multi-layered movie. 'Total Recall' is the proof that you don't need to make a seemingly intelligent film to be taken seriously. You don't achieve worldwide popularity by playing it dark and sinister. 'Inception' did but it was a project of a lifetime, Nolan's darling, reuniting a stellar cast, a sure Oscar-win for the Screenplay etc. etc. Verhooven only made the usual 90's film with an action star, he didn't play it like Bergman, he didn't overdo the special-effect aspect, he made an entertaining flick yet in a scene where Arnold is confronted to Edgemar telling it's all a dream, you got to scratch your head. Yes, it's full of cheesy one-liners punctuating two gunshots, but I'd take that over any close- up on Leo's deep introspective look. I'd take Sharon Stone's (so to speak) over any Marion Cotillard, and her fight with the sleazy and demure brunette Rachel Ticotin over any Ellen Page disguised a businessman. Yes, 'Inception' is made of dazzling landscapes and interminable buildings but it has no wisecracking Johnnie-Cab, no Rekall company asking you to choose the memory of a lifetime (one of the best scenes), no two-headed mutants, three-breast prostitutes, no Last Resort, no Cuato who seems like Churchill sculpted in a belly, no eye-popping when you try to breathe the atmosphere of Mars. 'Inception' took its imagery for granted but didn't provide what we expect from movies : escapism .. and aren't dreams the ultimate sources of escapism? 'Total Recall' was about the same idea of memories-implants, it leaves as many interrogation marks as 'Inception' and even at the end, we're not sure what is true and what is a dream, but we had a great time watching this film, for all these little aspects I mentioned, it had the Martian landscape in the background and it was enough, the rest looked faker than anything from Nolan's 'Inception' but are we that difficult in the 'suspension of disbelief' department. 'Inception' was made and sold as a complex (understand intelligent) movie, 'Total Recall' as an entertaining pop-corn flick, but lying underneath the action-adventure facade, there was some intelligence in 'Total Recall', after all an adaptation from Philip K. Dick's novel. On the other hand, 'Inception', as intelligent as it was, wasn't fun to watch ... because it was entrapped in its own concept, while in 'Total Recall', the concept was only the trigger to the action, it still had a story to tell and some actions to show instead of keeping on 'wowing' us on the intelligence of the script.. I guess that's symptomatic of what is wrong with filmmaking today, a movie is marketed to appeal to audience in so many criteria, so many blanks you got to fill that what you've got is an easy win, this is how technical perfectionism killed pure and fun creativity.",9,2,5,31 January 2015
Rocky," A 'genuine masterpiece' and the greatest Sports movie ever made ...
","Every time I visit 'Taxi Driver', 'Network' or 'All The President's Men''s boards, I find people whining about 'Rocky' winning the Best Picture Oscar in 1977. How did 'Rocky', a film that is so dull, feel good, old school, stereotypical, manipulative or mass audience appealing (as if that was negative) win over such intelligent masterpieces ? In other words, how could have Stallone beaten Scorsese? Well, maybe because you don't need a complex plot or a dark story conveying the eternal 'everything is crap' message told in a monotone voice-over, to have a good movie and Rocky is more than a good movie, it is what I would call a 'genuine masterpiece'.'Rocky' features ordinary characters with everyday needs and goals in life and there's an authentic feeling in the movie that touches you deeply in the heart, why so? Because it's not about characters, it's about relationships, Rocky is a lovable dim-witted guy and his friend Paulie is definitely not the nicest guy in the world, but their friendship is so real, that their interaction transcends their flaws and we guys cannot not identify with them. Adrian is a shy, nerdy, and not very attractive girl, but she and Rocky formed one of the most romantic cinematic couples who ever shared the screen. Mickey is a grouchy old man but the father-and-son relationship that'll develop between him and Rocky is particularly touching. And last but not least, Apollo who started as an arrogant show- man, very patronizing with Rocky, ended up respecting him. The relationships in 'Rocky' make the movie works emotionally with a believable sincerity. The story is driven by a very simple plot where characters progressively grow on you. We feel for them and we feel for Rocky who's the soul of the film.'Rocky' gives the average viewer a character to identify with -not an anti-hero à la Travis Bickle whose extreme acts might inspire some nut-cases, no- we have here an ordinary hero, a la George Bailey, who challenges his world in the ring. And that's what makes 'Rocky' the greatest sports movie ever made. The movie defines Sport. Sport is the greatest medium 'little guys' can still use to express themselves, to defy the big guys. In sport, no races, no classes, strength is in the heart. Sport is the revenge of the poor, the misfit, the dumb, who sometimes prove that there's kind of wise nobility in the physical effort that all the intelligence of the world can not reach. It's about strength, it's about passion, it's about HEART, and 'Rocky' has heart. And maybe that explains why it is one of the most eloquently criticized movies, as if 'Taxi Driver' or 'Network' ignited the disdain towards 'Rocky' twisting the meaning of such beautiful words like honesty, dignity, and humility into its most cynical interpretation : naivety.But simply because 'Rocky' doesn't fill your heart with anger and frustration doesn't make it a naive movie, it's easier to destroy and harder to build, and to build the determination and self-confidence of millions of people all over the world is an extraordinary achievement. And the inspiration comes from this vision of a man who goes through patience, pain and humiliations, and who gets hit so many times without falling that there is something very heroic in the ugliness of his face, as if it was carrying the mark of the nastiness of a world which won't give you what you want if you don't come to fight for it. Yes, 'Rocky' is about fighting, fighting the adversity for which the iconic steps represent the most powerful allegory, fighting your own demons, fighting your weaknesses, not fighting with bravery, but fighting despite the fear, fighting at the risk of losing everything except your most precious asset : dignity and winning nothing except your most precious conquest : respect.And before you call 'Rocky' cliché or naive, don't forget it's also a movie about a guy named Stallone, who was like a 'Rocky' in show business who wanted to make a movie about a guy who couldn't never have his break, and finally got the chance of his life, the chance to prove he wasn't a bum  Sly wanted to make this film, and (Yo Adrian!) he did it, and in a few months it was the highest grossing movie of the year, and grabbed the Best Picture Oscar. It's one of the most famous and fascinating box-office success stories, and more than that, it's an inspiration for all the average guys to believe in themselves and to go the distance. Rocky was a million-to-one shot, so was 'Rocky'.",10,0,0,11 October 2010
Eyes Wide Shut," Kubrick's epitaph to Humanity ...
","There is something profoundly sad in 'Eyes Wide Shut' ... is it because it's the last film of Stanley Kubrick, the Maestro, this gifted talent who put the word genius and movies together ? or because of this feeling of melancholic futility inhabiting the life of this couple who's got everything to be happy, yet seems to have registered to a formula where sex is an episodic necessity made of an ephemeral pleasure, and the rest is an ersatz of normality built around not to feel like something precious is being wasted ... indeed, boredom never seemed so real, so palpable, in a movie ironically made of movements and dialogs ... but the sadness is from this couple who chose 'deception as a necessity' ... the boredom is inside, imperceptible, which makes it even more pathetic. Only Kubrick could have made Cruise and Kidman so charming and pathetic in the same time.There is a kind of inner pathos in this bourgeois way of life, that would be scary if it wasn't so comic sometimes. Take Bill's insistence that he's a doctor as to give himself more credibility in some critical situations where self-importance might be helpful, Alice's morbid and paranoid pot-smelling approach to marital relationships, looking for an excuse to make her husband jealous, this jealousy used to spice up a meaningless life ... marriage as a false remedy and real catalysis of perversity (indeed, since perversity literally means, to deviate from). And that's the meaning of these acts, deviating from the road of monotony. It's not about sex but about feeling alive through desire, desire as a desire to be desired.Felling alive through the desire to be desired? Why? Is that because it's so normal to be desired by a husband that the feeling of love becomes artificial, does it feel like belonging to a world with no room for passion, for heart, for life. A fake world. A dreamy world, like sleeping and waiting for the awakening. Like a lucid dream with no awakening, is that Alice and Bill's nightmare ? Is that marriage ? a mutual lucid nightmare ? Bill lives in the illusion of happiness when Alice lives in the pursuit of an adulterous desire. But Bill is too intelligent not to realize the sadness of his condition and Alice too in love, not to admit the futility of her quest. They need each other, because Bill has no alternative and neither has Alice. Hence the lucid nightmare, and the only way to wake up is honesty ... or an extraordinarily scary journey into the 'other world'.Yes, the turning point is Bill's sexual 'adventure' during the film, discovering sex outside the marriage, like an odyssey into the underground, the world of illegitimate sex, through an investigation consumed by a jealous flame lit by Alice. A world made of fantasy expressed during the most peculiar moments, a world of extreme decadence where sex sounds like sect ... from a philosophical commentary of the danger of marital routine, the movie turns into a fascinating thriller where things doesn't seem like the way they are, making us wondering what hides behind those creepy masks, those pagan psalms. A reminiscent of the paranoid feeling from 'Rosemary's Baby' making us wondering if this is staged, or real, if its meaning is scary or if it is meant to be scary. The rituals we witness from Bill's point of view behind the thrills, highlight how we, humans, finally still need conventions even in the satisfaction of our lowest instincts, sex with a prostitute as a retributed service, sex as a fantasy hiding behind the curtain of reality, and sexual adult games so staged and sacred they become as institutional as marriage. Maybe we need to humanize our bestiality, to make it ridiculously human, not to feel like animals. Normal people go perverse to feel alive, and perverse people act conventionally to feel human, normality leads to perversity which fatally gets you back to normality. This is the whole vanity of perversity ...And at the end, Bill realizes he didn't value his luck to be with Alice and Alice realizes that her thirst and desire of lust was just a burst of ego, that would have made things worse and scarier had they become reality. They were saved by their love for each other like Bill's faithfulness prevented him from sex with a prostitute that'll be revealed to have AIDS and Alice realizing through her fantasy that she indeed loved her husband, even if it was in a very sad way. How such a positive conclusion can be so sad? Maybe because the 'other world' is even more dangerous and scary, and the illusory warm comfort of a castle made of bullshit stinks less than the reality of this bourgeois debauchery. Kidman sums it up quite well, when she expresses her disdain towards the 'Forever' word, nothing is sure, let's just admit it, but not say it. Now, they feel normal but they must feel alive, by igniting the desire that was almost extinguished by those doubts and treacheries. They just need ... she uses the F word, probably less obscene and more sincere than 'Forever'Oh yes, I really didn't expect these last lines, but they couldn't be truer and more powerful, they perfectly fit the film, and I guess after 'Don Corleone' these will be my most memorable concluding lines from a movie, I didn't expect such an optimistic, or let's say bittersweet ending ... all I can say is that the Maestro knows how to fit a music with the theme of a film. Optimism and sadness, fear and nostalgia, desire and passion, wisdom and realization ... beautifully embodied in the beautiful Waltz that made me cry at the end, with my eyes wide open, before shutting them and letting one tear running on my face, a tear to the memory of an immortal genius called ... Stanley Kubrick.",10,2,4,1 February 2011
Sicario," Unpleasant truths compensated by beautiful cinematography...
","'Sicario' leaves you with bitter feelings; it's like too real for its own good. You can't help but look at the world as an ugly, violent and merciless place where only wolves can survive and sheep only pray for never crossing their paths. That the heroine spends most of the time totally powerless and clueless about what's going around her is very revealing of 'Sicario''s message: there's no place for little hearts when it comes to fight drugs, money and corruption.Emily Blunt plays Kate, an FBI agent joining a CIA unit, lead by undercover officer Matt, played by Josh Brolin, for a mission in the Mexican borders. The target is a drug cartel overlord, indirectly responsible for the deaths of two SWAT agents, during a kidnapping rescue mission in Arizona, where one of his men, made a big hole on the wall with his shotgun before getting an equal treatment from Kate's rifle. The hole revealed dozens of corpses rotting inside and to viewers a foretaste of what 'Sicario' is heading to. This is no playground party, the stuff that'd rather make SWAT agents go outside and throw up.And don't get fooled by the presence of a FBI female agent, she doesn't pull a Clarice Starling or other Girl-powers trendy Hollywood tricks over the course of the film. During the operations, you can visually take her pulse, she represents our perspective, she's not a rookie, but in fact, she is. She discovers the world just as we do, and while expecting her to reach a breaking point, as the film progresses, I found extremely refreshing to have such a passive protagonist, totally frozen by tension or fear. And don't take it as machismo, but this is the kind of vulnerability that makes Kate a realistic character. Yes, there can be powerful female cops, but in a hand-to-hand fight with a guy, it's another story.And 'Sicario' story seems to convey the message that only wolves can survive by displaying the same level of savagery and mercilessness as their enemy. We live in a Darwinian world, where your survival doesn't rely on giving the other cheek, but being as strong as the predator, becoming one basically. And when wealth buys more protection, you gotta get stronger than all the levels of protections put together and this is where intervenes Alejandro, Matt's Colombian partner, magnificently portrayed by Benicio Del Toro. You can tell that Brolin had a lot of fun playing Matt, and I mean that positively, it made me enjoy his character, but it was as delightful to see Alejandro being the yin to Matt's yang, and keeping this mask of mystery for two thirds of the film, and still strike as a complex and enigmatic character, even after you get all the answers.'Sicario' is built on a complex and intricate plot where we never know exactly the real goals and motives of everyone, who is the good cop and the bad cop anyway? And Kate, along with her partner Reggie (Daniel Kaluuya) are kept in the dark, just like we are. And we have no other choice than follow the course of the investigation, another masterpiece of documentary-like realism, reminiscent of great gripping 70's thrillers like 'The French Connection' or 'The Day of the Jackal'. For instance, we're used to see aerial views of cities in action movies, but they never have been so significant to the plot than in 'Sicario'. We see the city of Juarez and we can observe it was build on a grid plan. Later, when we follow the long ballet of Police cars crossing the city, we can spot suspicious ones driving along parallel roads, and with the aerial view in mind, it all makes sense.'Sicario' is full of long panoramic takes, that never, never feel like exercises in style, it's always part of the narrative while adding a great aesthetic touch. It's a shame Roger Deakins will probably lose the Oscar to Lubeski's work in 'The Revenant', but while the cinematography in 'The Revenant' was close to perfect, I think the dazzling beauty of the natural locations helped a lot, while it takes some great work to make something beautiful out of slums or the sight of random and banal urbanism. The cinematography is also useful as the plot is focused on a world of violence and ugliness (you can't get uglier than a place where women and children can be killed, hanged, tortured and so forth) so the form works like a sort of relief from a rather heavy-loaded and difficult-to-watch content.I applaud 'Sicario' for its realism and its roughness, it's like raw meat with a delicate taste. The film was directed by Denis Villeneuve, and you can tell this is the work of an outsider, not an American, it's the Canadian school of brutal realism in a beautiful and subtly perverse way. The film reminded me of another masterpiece directed by a Canadian: David Cronenberg's 'A History of Violence', a story that also shows that some people have violence in their blood, and if you don't want to be the victims, you either fight or you flee as far as you can.And this is the message of the final confrontation that I won't dare to spoil. A lesser movie would have made the heroine do something very specific with the object she was given, a lesser movie would have made her a plain heroine, but the way it ended was faithful to the spirit of the film, and within its roughness, was a 'beautiful' ending.I'd almost feel guilty to think the movie as beautiful while it deals with such ugliness, but how about the title itself, 'Sicario' is such a pleasant, charming, almost lyrical word to pronounce, we wouldn't suspect it's the Latin historical word for 'hired killer'. There's a lot of ugliness behind the world's seemingly beauty, and after 'Sicario', we long for the opposite experience.",9,1,3,24 February 2016
Pretty Woman," Pretty woman, walking on the streets, pretty woman, the kind I'd like to meet
","This is from Roy Orbinson 1964's hit song that reached its cinematic posterity 26 years later, with Garry Marshall's film of the same name. Oddly enough, when taken in the context of the film, the lyrics take a totally different significance since the titular 'pretty woman' doesn't quite walk on the streets for pleasure.Of course, the song is used for the film's trademark sequence when Vivian tries new clothes from prestigious French sounding shops, fulfilling every little girl's fantasy. But there's something genuinely appealing in Julia Robert's performance, a sort of child-like eagerness to embrace a one-week dream and do whatever she wants because she got woman's most cherished accessory, not a handbag, not a lipstick or a mirror, but a credit card. Don't take that statement as patronizing and misogynistic please, 'Sex and the City' convey the same message, and bluntly assumes it. What differentiates Vivian from the other feminist icons though relies on the roots of her constant enthusiasm, forever incarnated by Robert's unique smile  and irresistible giggles.Indeed, no matter how much fun she has while seizing her luxurious days, we know that she's happy, more than anything, because she's in love. And the man might be rich, handsome and powerful, like a modernization of the 'Charming Prince' figure, there's something that oddly rings true in that peculiar love story. And this is a credit to two fine performances from Julia Roberts and Richard Gere, and a clever screenplay that doesn't take its premise for granted, starting from the obligatory meeting, which is the hit-or-miss of romantic comedies. Gere is Edward Lewis, he can't drive a friend's car and find his way to the hotel, he meets a prostitute named Vivian, she's not only attractive, but she's smart. She knows about car and end up driving him to the hotel. So, when he invites for just one night, that will turns into one week, plot-wise, the machine is working.'I want the fairy tale' she admits later, with an innocence that sweeps off all the dirt that has tarnished her life since she started walking on the streets. Never in the film, had she felt more sincere and more naively appealing. All little girls want the fairy tale, and that quote, if one thing, highlights the fact there still is that 'little girl' sparkle in Vivian's eyes, and her profession is only a logical consequence to unfortunate circumstances. But the film doesn't fall in the patronizing trap either, Vivian needs Edwards, but so does he. There's a clever parallel established by these two people's jobs, Edward buys out companies facing economic difficulties, to sell parts of them and make more profits. As she says, both screw people for money, and Edward is no more honorable than Vivian.Both hearts reflect the other's truth, that's the mark of true love and that's exactly what happens to Edward and Vivian. There's a nice subplot involving one company Edward doesn't want to buy because he likes its chairman, who's a sort of fatherly figure, wonderfully played by Ralph Bellamy, and it's only after his experience with Vivian that he realizes he doesn't enjoy his job as she did and might have chosen the wrong path for some obscure Oedipal reasons. Vivian, didn't embrace her career with more passion either, but maybe she kept on hoping of a real love, one that would be incarnated by the only thing she couldn't give her customers: a kiss. And the pay-off comes when she tenderly kisses a sleeping Edward in the mouth, at that point, we know she loves him.'Pretty Woman' doesn't overplay the whole Pygmalion-theme, that one is handled by Hector Elizondo, the hotel manager who, from despising Vivian, grows fond on her and teaches her how to properly behave. But the film doesn't use their archetypes for the sake of cheap laughs, it doesn't need to, Roberts is hilarious because she stays natural in a world she doesn't belong to, and never condescending either, Edward is inspired by her spontaneity, something that cruelly lacks in his work of sophistication and cynical materialism, incarnated by his friend and lawyer, played by Joe Constanza. Constanza, as the only true antagonist of the film, is responsible of one of the film's saddest parts, after Gere comforted him that Vivian wasn't a spy. After being approached like a cheap prostitute, you could feel she was truly hurt by Edward's betrayal.And this is what the film is about, two persons who don't want to be reduced to condescending label, one in the highest, and another in the lowest extreme. Being treated like a prostitute is the ultimate insult for Vivian because it totally negates her struggle to let her personality finally bloom, as Edward knows he's not that rich prick who only thinks in green bills. It's all about becoming yourself. I don't intend to make the film sound like an existential journey; it's still a heart-warming comedy but more intelligent and subtle than any comedy made today. And I'm sure in retrospect; many critics who despised the films would feel guilty for having labeled 'Pretty Woman' too straightforwardly as a banal and commercial romantic comedy.Rom-com, chick-flick, Cinderella story, feel-good story  cinematic jargon is rich of epithets to describe Garry Marshall's 'Pretty Woman'. Yet these words are too convenient and tend to veil the true poignancy and endearing chemistry between the two leads. Yes, we have the rich workaholic businessman with a disastrous sentimental life, meeting the streetwise hooker, with a heart of gold, but when played by Richard Gere and Julia Roberts whose shining smile illuminates the screen like a lamppost in Hollywood Boulevard, the film turns out to far better than some cynical minds might expect.At the end, I was left wondering: aren't the so-called stereotypes the names we give to obligatory plot devices when they're wrongly handled?",8,0,1,12 September 2013
Some Like It Hot," If the best jokes have the greatest punchlines, then 'Some Like it Hot' is indeed the greatest comedy...
","Is 'Some Like it Hot' as funny as its reputation implies? Yes, sir. Has it aged a little? Less than more recent comedies. Is it still funny anyway? Another yes. Is it really the funniest American comedy? It sure is one of them. Is it the best? Well, according to the American Film Institute it is. Let's get to the point now, Billy Wilder's screwball classic is not the greatest American comedy because it's the funniest, but just because it's one of the most classic among the funniest (and vice-versa). You might find 'Airplane!' or 'Animal House' funnier, or have a fondness for the wisecracking humor of the Marx Brothers or Mel Brooks, unless you're one of these purists who believe that nothing can beat the Silent Era pioneers, or that Woody Allen is the king of Comedy. Hell, it's also your right to find Sandler or Ferrell funnier. However, this is one comedy that will reconcile all these tastes. Comedy is probably as old as Cinema, and that providing laughs was the first premise of filmmaking when the special effects were still missing. 'Some Like it Hot' is right in the middle of Comedy's chronological map, old enough to be a classic, and modern enough to keep all its appeal toward modern audience. The film opens in the Prohibition days, in Chicago, paying tribute to classics such as 'Scarface', 'The Public Enemy' and 'Little Caesar' with a fitting role for George Raft, as the story bad guy: Spats Domino. The plot –do I need to describe it? - involves a bass player, Jack Lemmon as Jerry, and a saxophonist, Tony Curtis as Joe, who accidentally witness a shooting that is a reminiscence of the infamous St Valentine's Day Massacre. They disguise themselves as women to be hired in a female band going to Florida. Meanwhile in the train, they meet Marilyn Monroe as Sugar, a sweet, naive and idealistic ukulele player.If the film's setting pays tribute to old Hollywood, the content is incredibly fresh and subversive in the way it portrays women from two average Joes' point of views: as sensual and sexual objects of desire. Jerry's comment on Sugar's voluptuous body while she walks at the train station and reference to Jelly-O springs is so full of lust when it concludes by 'It's a whole different sex'. The film plays with cross-dressing and gender comedy with the perfect dosage of naughtiness and innocence. The part where Sugar is in the same bed as Joe aka Daphne and he keeps repeating in himself 'he's a man' gives you an idea about the kind of reaction he's having, being in bed with such a beautiful instrument player. Along with 'Anatomy of a Murder' and 'Psycho', 'Some Like it Hot' is one of the most defining examples of the agonizing days of Censorship, indeed, I would have never thought I would hear the word 'frigid' coming from Marilyn's mouth.But beyond its modern tone, 'Some Like it Hot' is mostly carried by two top-notch performances from the two leads and two strokes of genius in the casting of Marilyn Monroe as Sugar, and Joe E. Brown as the old billionaire who falls in love with Daphne in Florida. Sugar has this naivety and sweet tenderness that wouldn't have been believable if another actress played that part. Marilyn embodied this kind of personality, trusting men, victim of their lies and promises, but what lead to her demise in real-life is used for a much happier ending here. Still, there is something poignant in the way Sugar trusts the two girls, but the film never keeps that in a mean-spirited tone, especially since it's a matter of life and death for Joe and Jerry and since, Joe E. Brown steals the show in every single scene to incarnate the kind of comeuppances Jerry needed for his exuberant behavior. 'Some Like it Hot' is punctuated by countless iconic scenes, from Monroe playing her ukulele and singing 'Runnin' Wild' to her 'I Wanna be Loved by You' song, we're both fascinated by Monroe's sex appeal and Joe and Jerry's struggle to keep theirs intact. And the story doesn't take its plot for granted but adds a supplementary twist by introducing another romance between Jerry and Sugar. Jerry exploits Osgood's crush on Jerry to disguise himself as a 'harmless' billionaire, inviting Sugar in Osgood's yacht while the owner is dancing a frenetic tango with his sweetheart. The way the subplots interact between the last confrontation with Spats Domino is cleverly handled and plays as a fantastic tribute to Wilder's clever writing. Yet even before the last five minutes, the film is funny without having this little thing that elevates it above all the other comedies.Many comedic films end with the conventional happy ending or the resolution, it might have a final gag or a funny bit, but hardly the highlight of the film. 'Some Like it Hot' follow the principles of the greatest jokes, it can drag a long, be averagely funny, even annoying, but if the pay-off is hilarious, the joke works. Movie endings can redeem any film, but this applies even more for comedies. And in 'Some Like it Hot', not only the ending is one of the greatest of any film, but if you pay attention to the dialog between Daphne and Osgood, it works as a summary of everything that went before, and the last dialog couldn't have worked without all what happened.We all know that Daphne will sooner or later remove his wig and reveal his identity as Joe did with Sugar, but Osgood seems so casual about that the final line must be a killer, the strike of the film, its triumph, and on that level, Wilder did it again, after Norma's 'close-up', 'Well, nobody's perfect' are three distinct words that differentiated a funny screwball comedy to a perfect classic.",10,1,1,2 April 2012
Inside Man," Spike Lee toying with the conventions and non-conventions of an overly codified genre... for our greatest delight and excitement!
","If a movie deals with a crisis, it better offers a proper resolution. This is why hostage movies have always been unnerving experiences to me. I'm not too brave whether in a good or a bad way, so I'm more likely to emphasize with the hostages and one victim can be one too many.'Inside Man' is a heist film whose perfectionist tone is set from the start and so is its kinship with 'Dog Day Afternoon' (Lee even included a hostage named Miriam, played by the same actress three decades before and the same actor playing the pizza delivery-man). But while in Lumet's classic, Pacino stumbled with the gift box to get the rifle out and one of the accomplices chickened out foreshadowing the disaster to be- here we have four robbers fully masked, deactivating the cameras, undressing the hostages, giving them the same uniforms they wear and proving organization-wise that the comparison with 'Dog Day' will only extend to the frantic media coverage.One of the robbers, named Russell, is played by Clive Owen. He introduces us to the story with the premise that he's made a perfect heist. I was wondering what he meant by 'perfect' but I assumed it had to be clean and that caught my attention. Indeed, while there's a general consensus that we must know the villains mean business and won't take any chances (security guards are always the first victims and over the course of the robbery you have a smart guy who wants to be the hero), 'Inside Man' made me decide that there shall not be any civilian death. Why? Because a/I took Russell at his word and believed there would be no civilian deaths b/ even the security guard wasn't killed (a rarity) and c/ the most significant defiance to the robbers' authority went unpunished.So there's clearly a sense of misleading that emerges from the first operational minutiae, which it's not surprising from a Spike Lee film. While the director is mostly known for his racism-themed and originally crafted films, here he shows his talent in toying with the viewers' expectations and subvert many tropes of a genre that has been codified to the point of dogmatic requirements. Besides, isn't it more thrilling to have protagonists as competent as their counterparts? On that level, 'Inside Man' is still closer to 'Dog Day Afternoon' than 'Die Hard' (which I love).And as Frazier, the man in charge, Washington plays a focused and rather relaxed cop who understands quickly that there's something unusual about the robbery... so unusual that he's got to understand the robbery to better stop it, he doesn't need men or weaponry, what he needs is time.And that's one of the first hints that the heist has been engineered with the smallest detail in mind, because time is precisely what Russell and his team needs but it shouldn't be their call but the cops'. And since we deal with smart men, it doesn't take time long for Frazier to realize how convenient it is that Russell gives him the time he needs, whether through false tracks involving a recorded foreign language or a riddle à la Simon Gruber that the team (including Chewitel Ejiofor and Willem Dafoe) still debate after the phone call.Therefore, Frazier's issue is the following: is Russell stalling or bluffing? The robbery turns out an exciting poker-game where the cards are finally laid at the end. The catch is that the robbery is so captivating that I was wondering about the purpose of the Christopher Plummer part. Ebert kept criticizing it because of the suspension of disbelief regarding his age, I could forgo that element. What bothered me was the importance given to that plot device at a moment where the focus was the hostages, and such a big deal was made about the involvement of the fixer, played by Jodie Foster and some mysterious case she got to take back from the safe that. Naturally, that had to be more than a detail and the script ties the plot together at the end and allows the subplot to give the big one its overdue pay-off... and if the level of excitement is nowhere close to the cops vs. robbers, Plummer and Foster are as pivotal to the story as Washington and Owen.Once again, Lee is some trickster because he seems to have made the film like Owen orchestrated his plan, anticipating the reactions and questionings from the viewers. When Frazier believes Russell's stalling and provokes Owen, the scene is followed by its biggest shock, one that could almost ruin my enjoyment, except for the fact that it served its purpose whether you think of the film's plot or the robbers, which are quit the same. The film's ending reveals the final details of the robbery and justifies the use of a clever editing that consisted of hostages' post-robbery. Over the course of the film, I was wondering why they were all asked whether thy took part to the heist, and then something hit me, why shouldn't they? How about that being part of the plan?The editing might be the film's masterstroke (which is saying a lot) because we've seen heist movies before, some made great dramas, other great action pictures, but how many robberies are told like a 'mystery' film? At the end, we're not just impressed by the genius of the plan, but the way Lee reinvented the genre using unconventional elements and yet relying on conventions. Not your typical Spike Lee joint but a terrific thriller, served by a fine performance from Denzel Washington.",8,3,3,6 October 2019
Hoosiers," A powerful sports drama with a motivational score like only the 80s could produce...
","'We love it when giants fall. It's part of our collective social consciousness. We build up heroes and once they reach a certain plateau of success over a period of time, we tire of them. We love underdogs and want to see an upset'This is from Stephen Denny's 'Killing Giants', a fascinating book drawing many parallels between business competition and the sports world, insisting that while anyone can be small size-wise, there's no such a thing as a small player, it's even the most enviable position as you've got to beat the odds as well as the opponent. That's why cinema too loves underdogs, it's the stuff dreams are made on.David Anspaugh's 'Hoosiers' is one of these sports movies, distilling from real-life a story that underlines the term 'underdog' so much the film might only be accused of insisting too much on the 'small' thing; small town, small high school, relatively small basketball players, to the point that 'Rudy', the second feature film from Anspaugh makes a perfect companion piece to 'Hoosiers'. And like 'Rudy', the main cast doesn't actually play the game, the team is 'only' the instrumental device meant to bring pride to the Indiana farmers, the Hoosiers people. Their shot at the championship is theirs for feeling significant and happy and accepting the banal normality of their life. Sport is an instrument of social cohesion and it's the film's credit to evoke the passion from the outsider's perspective.Here's another example: few weeks ago, the Moroccan team was eliminated from the African Nations Cups in the worst possible way: a missed penalty shot at the 93rd minute that would have meant victory. Those make-it-or-break-it moments define the fascination for sport, a metaphor for life where one tactical choice, one move, a boost of insurance or a moment of hesitation make the difference, one can get off a game as a hero or a pariah, the verdict of the crowd is part of the game too. As Moroccans, we all felt shaken and betrayed not much because our country lost but because we were prevented from an opportunity to be happy. And the vox populi blamed the coach for having picked the wrong player. This is a situation Norman Dale could have related to.Some aspects of the Hickory team's story have been fictionalized and I read that the real coach wasn't exactly a middle-aged man but it doesn't matter, the film does add a few cinematic conventions but finds a nice way to make Hickory's ascension to the title tie the plot together, with the overarching idea that everyone deserves a second chance, it's all a matter of seizing the opportunity once it comes. For once, it's not about the players, they're good already, the closest to a real underdog is a vertically-challenged boy who must deal with mockeries and his own insecurity, and Jimmy, an enigmatic young prodigy who's mourning the death of the previous coach and refuses to play anymore. We expect his entrance to be pivotal in the plot and it is, but in a way that honor the script's restrained tone, not going for cheap emotionality despite the temptations. This is not the eighties' 'Rocky's'.The film doesn't play either the circumstances that pushed Dale outside the basket court like a sort of trauma or big reveal, Gene Hackman with his unbeatable instinct to play normal guys, plays it smoothly as someone who doesn't want to get into trouble and tries to deal with the defiance of the townsfolk who disapprove his methods (some are on his side though). The philosophy of Norman is that whoever wants to play gets in the court, he respects Jimmy's choice and never tries to overstep the boundaries of his authority and doesn't want in return his authority to be defied. He's a man of discipline but not an iron-hand either. And because he believes in second chances, he gives one to Shooter, a former star and player's father, played by Dennis Hopper (Oscar-nominated for the role).Hopper gives a remarkably desperate energy that cuts straight in your heart, a man for which basketball meant something and is transmitting not only the passion but the expertise, that's the kind of nuances so smart and well-pointed that I regretted the film's needless romance with Barbara Hershey or a few missed moments with the players, who're getting with the coach the chance to be on the top of the world, and even once in a lifetime makes it all worth it. That was the philosophy of 'Rudy' as well, something that transcended the banal goal of victory and make sport the real star of the film. Basket-ball couldn't have a better homage, the tactical moves aren't just artistic licenses and we get enthralled by the final game and the way the winning points are won at the last minute, you might think it's unbelievable but sports is full of such unbelievable stories.In his 'Killing Giants' book, Denny provides an interesting example example among many others involves a 1941 boxing game where Joe Louis won by knocking down his opponent, a cocky Irishman named Bill Conn who wanted the knock-out although he had the game already, he seized the final opportunity to get him with an uppercut and the heavyweight title in the process proving that it's not over till it's over. Basket-ball allows more latitude to the players but also works under the same conditions, and right now I still don't know which score stuck the most to my mind, the final 43 to 40 or Jerry Goldsmith's inspirational theme that makes me want to take my trainers and go run ten miles, right now I have that music playing in my mind!",8,0,0,25 July 2019
Pulp Fiction," The Nineties, one Masterpiece and a Mysterious Black Briefcase ...
","Writing is an instinct Quentin certainly possesses, and with 'Pulp Fiction', his second film, he made a sensational break-through entrance in the great directors' joint. His influence on movies in the late 90's and early 00's is indisputable and even after 16 years, the freshness and originality of 'Pulp Fiction' never ceases to strike. The film is thrilling, entertaining and darkly amusing from the beginning to the ending. Indeed, 'Pulp Fiction' is just one of these films where things reach such a level of whatever makes movies worth being admired; on the top of that : writing. This is what makes 'Pulp Fiction' rhymes with perfection and what most defines the Tarantinesque style.Chapter 1. The Cannolis of the Nineties.Writing is the special ingredient. When characters talk in a Tarantino film, the subtlety is that it makes you think it has nothing to do with the plot, that it's totally irrelevant, when in fact it is totally irrelevant and random yet it serves the plot. One golden rule in screen writing is that what you put must be related to the story : Tarantino throws away this rule and still respects it. The discussion about the little differences and how they call hamburgers is mentioned again when Jules asks Brett about it and till now, Vega's 'Royale with Cheese' still resonates as the Canolli's quote of the 90's. The foot massage discussion finds another relevancy as it helps to characterize Marcellus's sensitivity and electrify the whole interaction between Jules and Mia. The Gold watch story, makes Butch' burst of anger totally understandable when Fabienne admits she forgot it. There were 1000 ways to make us learn about the Gold watch story, Tarantino takes a legendary actor telling us with such conviction we don't know if we're supposed to laugh or take it seriously. Deeper than that, notice how the Divine Intervention that saves Jules and Vincent's asses, inspired different reactions and the one who decides not to retire will ultimately be killed. God seems to play with fate like Tarantino with plot devices. Notice how Jules' decision will save Ringo and Pumpkin and lead to an Ezekiel's bloodless recitation. And of course, the reappearance of the two robbers at the end of the film is another tribute to Quentin's creative trademark: non-linear narrative structure. Sure Quentin didn't invent that, but he transcended it, making it an element of entertainment and total unpredictability. We'll go back to unpredictability later.Chapter 2. From 'Misirlou' to 'Surf Rider' Music is one of the key qualities of Quentin Tarantino films. It's like a second casting, Quentin casts his music like he does for his female characters. What would have been this film without the dazzling 'Misirlou' start, without 'Girl, You'll be a Woman', and the iconic 'You Never Can Tell' featuring one of the weirdest but most memorable and reenacted cinematic dance sequences. Quentin doesn't embarrass himself by choosing a composer or a grandiloquent score, no, he drains his inspiration from Pop Culture, from existing songs that would have probably sunk into oblivion if there weren't touched by Tarantino's selective instinct. The music is like a second language in his film, and it sure mixes perfectly well, with the dialogs. Whenever I hear the shrill voice of Honey Bunny shouting ' last one of ya' I immediately imagine 'Misirlou' starting, like the emblematic hymn of the 90's. But music ain't the only one element ejecting the movie from the land of normality  Chapter 3. Perfection : from Head to Foot.Tarantino is the goddamn casting fairy of them actors  no seriously, he has like a magic power, who else could have made Travolta resuscitating after his 'Look Who's Talking' career? Who else could have made Samuel L. Jackson look so bad-ass with this ridiculous wig? Who else could have convinced Ving Rhames to re-enacts Ned Beatty's deliverance? Oh, I should get to the point, who else can make so close to perfection female castings, covering all tastes of women we can imagine : from the hypnotic Uma Thurman, to the hysterical Yolanda, to the punky pierced Jody, from the sweet and tender Fabienne to the sensuous lips of Esmarelda Villalobos, they're all defining a specific feminine charm. And thanks, Mr. Tarantino to make us finally assume out little fetishism  Chapter 4. Black Humor and White TowelsUnpredictability relies on what I would call the little differences that makes 'Pulp Fiction' a classic film. It has this thing in common with other masterpieces like 'The Godfather' or 'Citizen Kane', where every single scene is a classic, from A to Zed. The meaning of the title, the robbery preceding the opening credits, the mysterious glowing stuff inside the briefcase, the foot massage discussion, the square visual effect, the dance contest, Mia's feet walking on the floor, the adrenaline shot, the Coolidge vs. Hoover fight, Esmarelda's feet stepping on the accelerator, Fabienne's oral wish, Fabienne's f sweet accent, Vincent's death, Marcellus crossing the road with his box of donuts, Zed and Maynard, the Gimp, Marcellus's medieval speech, Zed's demise, Marvin  now that was unpredictable, who could see that coming? Should we laugh? Yes, 'cause it's funny as hell. It was an accident, as if it was supposed to be an excuse. The whole movie and what follows is the ultimate proof that this film is a masterpiece of comedy; the whole 'Bonnie' situation creates so many gags, including the memorable appearance of Winston Wolf. This part sacred 'Pulp Fiction' as a great film; and the last minutes made it a classic.End of story. When Jules and Vincent leave the restaurant, with the 'Surf Rider' song starting, you know your eyes have been watching something new and fresh, something that will change the face of movies for a bunch of years to come. Just for 'Pulp Fiction', Quentin Tarantino deserves to be admitted in the directors writers' hall of fame.",10,1,2,7 February 2011
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Some kind of a bloody joke...
","'Shotguns? What, like guns that fire shot?' 'Oh, you must be the brain of the operation!' 'What d'you do when you're not buying stereos, Nick? Finance revolutions?'Sorry, didn't know your father.' 'Never mind son, you just might meet him if you carry on like that.' And I could go on and on, mentioning an epiphora-driven monologue involving the act of killing a Greek whose stupidity might be the one saving grace or some snarky remark about Liberia's deficit in a skyrocket. It all comes down to one observation, if there is one deficit Guy Ritchie's 'Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' doesn't suffer from, is in one-liners. If anything, this is a film that made me aware, in my late teen years, of something called a screenplay. This is the work of a talented screenwriter, there's no doubt about that.Now, how about the director's perspective? And how about my appreciation, now that I'm twice the age I was when I first saw it? Well, the film still got it, as far as my enjoyment is concerned, but there are a few buts (and I'm not talking of marijuana cigarette butts or the lovely one belonging to that stripper's who caught the attention of Barry the Baptist, before assigning two Northern slobs some theft job involving the two titular barrels).So, 'but', I was saying.I don't know if 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' is more about revealing the talent of a British director making his spectacular and stylish debut, or if it more consolidates the status of an American director as the most defining and influential director of his generation, quite a stunt for someone in his mid-30's. While it is obvious that Ritchie has a great way with words and his screenplay features one of the highest ratio of one-liners per minute from any film, it was still Tarantino who exposed that new vision of the underground world, one that would never be afraid to be offensive and raunchy if laughs were the pay-off.It was easier to embrace that form of entertainment once it was done, so let's give QT the credit he deserves and get back to Ritchie. Indeed, it would be unfair to associate his 1998 hit film only to the influence of Tarantino, you can actually spot many influences that cover a wide range of cinematic genre and directors, you have a nod to Sergio Leone's 'For a Few Dollars More', Zorba, you have smart-ass lines like the kind Groucho Marx would deliver, and in fact, the whole movie that seems like a kaleidoscope of all the archetypes nourished from years of movies, poker-games, drug trafficking, caper story, shaggy dog stories and other mix-ups, except that Ritchie used to direct ads' clips.This might be the one part where he diverges from Tarantino, one started from scratch, mostly through imitating other directors, Ritchie had his own style. And there are instances where you can tell the film is directed like a video clip, or an ad.'Lock, Stock' is like a big, boisterous, joke whose only purpose is to entertain, and I respect that, because entertainment is Guy's strongest suit. He doesn't even need a main protagonist, the leading quartet, Eddie, Tom, Soap and Bacon, whose most notable presence is Jason Statham and to a lesser extent Tom Flemyng (but to play fair with the cast, let's mention Jason Flemyng and Dexter Fletcher), these guys are all down-on-their-luck outcasts, with one toe in the criminal world, and another in traffics, so benign it would never raise the attention of Scotland Yard. These guys are so 'inoffensive' really that they're not even affected by the bloody chain of events they caused.And the whole story relies on the four protagonists' luck when it comes to their mission about getting the money to pay for a debt Harry Hatchet (PH Moriarty), or avoiding to get their fingers cut off by Barry the Baptist (Lenny McLean), or cross the path of Big Chris, convincingly played by former soccer player Vinnie Jones. It is very ironic that the main concerned one don't ever realize what has happened, and no less ironic that Jason Statham, the ultimate tough guy isn't given enough occasion to be the celebrated bad-ass he is. The film is like a private joke between Ritchie and the audience, because what matters is what we see, who cares about the rest. We don't even see the blood, which is a nice touch that keeps this film in a sort of jolly friendly mood.Ritchie knows we're familiar with all these archetypes and what he does is providing a little twist, never wasting a moment for a wisecrack and a smart-ass line, it's almost a signature in his films. And it works, because he's like Tarantino, he belongs to the generation of directors influenced by other directors but who demonstrate how much of fans they are by adding a touch of modernity, and this modernity is made of close-ups, slow-mo, shootouts, every trope of the action genre. You can call it 'exercise in style', the term isn't to be used negatively, it's got style, it's fun, energetic and crazy. And it's got a terrific casting, too, but it's mostly for Lenny McLean who died shortly after the film and Vinnie Jones that the film works,, honorable mention too for Van Blackwood who with Nick the Greek, form a nice duo.This is a film that shows a new face for British movies, one that comes right after 'Trainspotting', 'The Full Monty', a popular British type of movies that completes the work of Tarantino. It's a product of its era that encapsulates the level of creativity reached by directors who didn't have much budget, really one of the gems of the 90's.",8,1,1,14 June 2017
Les Misérables," Where's the 'Mute' button?
","I tried. I really tried.But after a third failed attempt, I guess I'll have to declare myself forfeit. I can't watch 'Les Miserables' in its entirety not with keeping myself glued to the screen anyway. I'm not sure I would use it as a background noise sorry, I meant music. I love 'The Misérables' as a story but is the fame so great for the American audience that director Todd Hopper thought a musical would be the best way to boost the audiences or grab the interest. I know it's an adaptation from a Broadway musical, but this is no musical, this is an opera, a loud, bombastic opera where every line is sung as loudly as if the actors' lives depended on it, it comes to such a proportion that there's no purpose whatsoever to have a language section in the Bonus Features and here's why.The second time I tried to give the film a chance, I put the French version, just for fun, well, what do you know, the songs were kept in the original language so that French was popping up here and there in a few random moments where the characters actually spoke, like ten minutes in a whole, I totally forgot it was in French. That's how ubiquitous singing is, and not just singing, everything is emphasized to the point that you almost feel the pain and the agony of all these talented actors but so-so singers, it's like you witness suffering and despair in motion, and again, it's so omnipresent that there's no moment that can pass as relief, one you could catch your breath. Even the highlight of the film that earned Anne Hathaway her Oscar is diluted in the rest where it's all the same loud and hyperbolic songs. 'I Dreamed a Dream' is memorable but not a standalone moment because everything else is just the same.The film had everything, the sets, the decoration, a talented cast, Hugh Jackman did a convincing Jean Valjean and even Crowe could be a decent Javert, I wasn't even shocked by Sacha 'Borat' Cohen as Thénardier whose villainous two-faced creepy role has often been played by comedic actors as to highlight the grotesque clown-looking men, but Todd Hopper's choice to tackle the story through singing wasn't the most inspired. He proved to have succeeded with simpler methods with his 'King's Speech' which, while not the most flamboyant movie of the year, was still moving enough to catch the hearts of people. Here, it's like the young, and certainly talented and well-intended director, was so wrapped up by his success he wanted his musical. Recently, Damien Chazelle did the same with a better movie, and yet lost to the more modest 'Moonlight'. Sometimes, the fewer, the better.Musicals are hit-or-miss but while 'Les Misérables' is a critical success (or was it?), I'm not sure it's the wisest approach to a story that is multi-layered and benefits from regular acting. Take the scene where Valjean meets the priest who saves him from another arrest with the candelabra, this is a quiet and powerful moment between two men, something that should say a lot without an abundance of lines, here they're singing their lungs out and it's totally inappropriate, if not comical. So many attempts on emotions are lost because of this focus on opera and the more you progress in the story, the more you realize it was a bad strategy after all.Indeed, if people aren't into music and opera, they will not enjoy it, if they do, they'll hate the singing and deem it as amateur and cringe-worthy, a simple glimpse at IMDb's review section will give you an idea. So 'Les Miserables' belongs to the posterity on a simple Wikipedia-level, but I'm not sure it will have this aura that stands the test of time, and as if it embraced its own malediction, even Anne Hathway wasn't too happy about her win.The film was obviously made to impress, but I wish it wished to 'express' as well.",6,1,5,5 June 2017
Titanic," At least, 'Titanic' will never sink ... into oblivion ...
","'Titanic' was the cinematic phenomenon of the 90's and the worldwide highest grossing film of all time before being dethroned by 'Avatar', from James Cameron (the only director who could ever beat James Cameron in the box-office). Now, 'Titanic' has become the quintessential cool-to-hate film, hence one of the most controversial Best Picture winners, which is surprising because if anything, the movie screams 'Best Picture'. There's something quite unique in the way the huge success of 'Titanic' became a defining key of detestation, challenging any attempt for a rational appreciation. Well, we're in 2011 now : the hype has passed, CGI became a tiresome trend providing a series of unoriginal special-effects-driven films, Kate won an Oscar and Scorsese injected some cinematic botox on Leo's ex-pretty-boy face. In these circumstances, I believe we have enough distance to judge 'Titanic' again, regardless of all the peripheral elements that contributed to its success, back then, in 1997 When 'Titanic' was released, I was the kind of teenager who avoided any mainstream phenomenon, needless to say that I categorically refused to be brainwashed by the 'Titanic' wave. The film was the absolute must-see and the girls were all drooling over Di Caprio, and you couldn't listen to the radio or watch TV musical programs without having the annoying flute of Celine Dion's 'My Heart Will Go On'. I was far from imagining that this music would define my personal nostalgia of the late 90's. Then the movie grabbed 11 Oscars, it was the most watched and re-watched film ever and I even had to make an essay about 'Titanic' at school, where I eagerly expressed that the 'Iceberg story left me cold'But suddenly something strange happened. The bubble of popularity popped, some little fellows displayed a childish pride of having disliked the film. And I can't count how many girls were so pleased to say that Leo was too girlish, when one year before, he had an 'angel face'. Then I reversed my position, and from the enthusiasm of having avoided the film, I wanted to understand why people were being so hypocritical with their own appreciation, and feel guilty as if they admired a naked Emperor, with all flash and no substance. This is how 'Titanic' gradually became the 'cool-to-hate' film, because it's always cool to hate popular stuff, but it's so uncool to try to be cool so this was my personal encouragement to give it a chance in 1999, and to know where I stood for. I came, I saw and I liked it.I'm not even afraid to admit that I loved it, it had everything I was expecting, it was spectacular, thrilling, romantic, and didn't rely too much on special effects except for the terrific sinking part. Yes, the film flirts with cinematic clichés sometimes, the whole 'follow your heart' message is almost Disney-like, but this is the point of the film, it's the romance with the Titanic as a setting, not the Titanic's story featuring a romance. When we think of 'Titanic', we have less the image of the ship breaking in half in our minds, than Kate and Leo flying over the sunset, this is the defining image of the film and one of the most iconic of American Cinema. And this is the strength of the film.A few recent movies have managed to achieve a classic status so quickly, and so impacting the way 'Titanic' did and this is certainly due to the constant symbiosis between the story and the special effects that provided the 'classic' vibe, and whether it was intentional or not, it sure succeeded. 'Titanic' has the thrills, the romance, and an inspirational message, simple enough to appeal to all the sensitive hearts all over the world. And seriously, let's not get too cynical about the marketing campaign, and deny the artistic value of some of the most financially successful films. There's a time for Independent films and another one for spectacular blockbusters  as long as there is a good story, justifying the use of special effects, and the exhilarating sinking sequence.'Titanic' had the intelligence to have a sort of classic story that could appeal on a universal level. A love story undermined by a tragedy, it's sad and inspiring, a love story between a rich aristocratic woman and a third-class youthful and optimistic boy, it's universal, the whole tragedy of the 'Titanic' has been touched by a cinematic grace that made it one of the greatest American classics, and I mean 'great' in the classic meaning of the world. And I better take an innocent story, even naive, rather than a spectacular but dull one, like 'Independence Day' one year before or a thought-provoking but manipulative one, like 'Saving Private Ryan' the year after. So, I loved 'Titanic', I felt for the characters, the part where one mother reads a story for her children while the ship sinks will haunt me forever, the music beautifully conveys the innate sadness of a rather passionate romance. The film revives the greatest tradition of the disaster genre with a perfectionism that finally paid-off, and I applaud James Cameron for that. And now, I wonder what the haters hate in the film, what makes 'Lord of the Rings' so deeper than 'Titanic', love story, good vs. evil? Don't they miss the young Leo who could smile and shout even the cringe-worthy 'king of the world' line? Regarding the actual cinematic trends, 'Titanic' is a classic among the classics and the deserving Best Picture of 1997.So, I don't find any particular reason to hate this film, and if I ever found one, let's say  uh, the part with the necklace which I didn't really care for, well, for one reason to dislike the film, I can find ten to love it. Disliking 'Titanic' just because it was once so popular is simply a titanic mistake",9,3,6,23 October 2011
Rocky III," The most difficult fight is against our inner demons ...
","In 'Rocky III', we're so far from the atmosphere of the previous films that the result could have been disastrous if it wasn't (again) for the characters and their genuine appeal. They're all here, Rocky, Adrian, Paulie, Mickey and Apollo, the fantastic five embarked for the last time together for one of the most defining film of the flamboyant 80's, the third opus of the 'Rocky' series.On the surface, Stallone really took the distance from the first two films, featuring a Rocky Balboa at the pinnacle of his boxing career, the undefeated Heavy Weight Champion of the World. The Italian Stallion's success even mirrors Sly's iconic status in the 80's: the movie begins with a clever montage featuring Sly himself after the first 'Rocky' launched his career, it's a whole different mood, forget the austere Philadelphian streets and say hello to the 80's with its lot of action, glitter and cringe-worthy over-the-top moments (gay ballade on the beach, the infamous boxing/wrestling gala fight etc.) and of course, the hit-song that plays as a fitting subtitle: 'Eye of the Tiger'. Say anything about Stallone and his 'Rocky' series, but no one can deny that the guy named Sly knew how to create an impact.The first booming notes of 'Eye the Tiger' resonate as a hymn for passion, hunger for fight, and thirst for victory, the 70's are over when the world needed an underdog hero going the distance, no place for the small players, it's all about winning and fighting and defeating, while Stallone created another cinematic icon that defined the 80's through John Rambo. 'Rocky III' had to stand out for some values that are less appealing now, and this is why the first opus is still the one that stood the test of time. Still, the catchy Oscar-nominated 'Tiger' song injects some pep in our veins and makes 'Rocky III' the solid conclusion of a great trilogy. And that's why we notice the flaws of 'Rocky IV' more than in 'Rocky III', it didn't have 'The Eye of the Tiger', much more than a song, a concept as powerful and defining as Dirty Harry's 'Make my day' quote in the Reagan era.Now, should I really enumerate the flaws of 'Rocky III'? As for 'Part II', does it really matter? I guess yes since a review asks for a minimum of objectivity, I have to mention that again, the movie sins by a predictable script whose structure parallels the second film's plot, who would have bet on Rocky after watching the first training montage? Anyway, it went like this, first act : Rocky is good, second act : he's down, third act: he's back, with all the cheers and applauds Â… and despite all the obviousness, it works. The 'Rocky' sequels illustrate the idea that the greatness of a film can rely on its 'wowing' conclusion. On that basis, 'Rocky III' is a winner, not a Heavy Weight champion like 'Rocky' but still, a film that works, and unlike 'Rocky II', it doesn't work less thanks to Rocky Balboa, than to all the other supporting characters around him. For once, Rocky is central to the plot but not to the appreciation of the film. You can tell that Mr. T, Burgess Meredith, Carl Weathers and even Talia Shire steal the show.The most memorable aspect of the film is the antagonism and how a good replacement Clubber Lang is to Apollo Creed. Mr. T is like a mean-spirited but more determined version of Apollo, and despite what he said, I'm sure he just didn't pity but probably hated the fool he thought Balboa was. There's an interesting contrast set between Lang and Rocky. Lang is closer to Rocky's roots while Rocky became too smart, well-dressed and self-confident, it might discomfort some viewers in his first scene with Paulie but I guess it helps to build the new personality of Rocky, something that will be echoed in a poignant discussion with Mickey, who informs Rocky that he got civilized, in other words, he doesn't have the muscle anymore to fight killers like Lang. Psychoanalytically speaking, Clubber is what Rocky lacks. Logically, Rocky loses his match against Clubber and when it couldn't have been any worse, he loses even more.The movie takes an emotional way, which is what the 'Rocky' series have done best and after the tear-jerking farewell to Mickey, the grumpiest and most lovable sports coach, Rocky face a serious existential crisis. This is where Apollo makes his entrance, and closes the story's arc of his relationship with Rocky. As I said in my review of the first film, 'Rocky' has always been about relationships and interactions, this is what makes the movies work, despite their flaws. And in the third opus, it's an extraordinary idea to allow the defeated Apollo to take a share from Rocky's victory, reminding us that Apollo's last defeat was a very close call and the Rock still have something to learn, to take his pride back. But it ain't easy fighting his own demons and this is when the shy good wife Adrian let Rocky open his heart, admit his own fears and set his mind up to challenge Clubber Lang again. The eye of the tiger is a burning flame that got ignited in the heart.So it's easy to criticize 'Rocky III' and mock the evolution of the characters, but the movie is still a good cinematic achievement, more entertaining and heart-warming than your average sports films, it works because the first two films built a gallery of unforgettable characters, we learned to know, to appreciate and to love, as if unconsciously, we never wanted the series to end",7,0,0,29 November 2011
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," And so began a decade-defining saga...
","'What's a Muggle?'Two minutes after the film started and that was the first question I asked, my young brother told me the word defined people without magical abilities. A sort of wizard-goyim I guess. Anyway, I can't describe the satisfaction I felt over getting that simple information. Knowing the meaning of 'Muggle' was strangely overwhelming.Indeed, the series stopped almost one decade ago, started nearly two, and the books are now part of pop (and legitimate) culture and children's literature heritage... so the fact that I resisted so long gave an additional aura of mystification and I was getting my first real peek on the classic. Forget about Harry Potter, Hermione, Voldemort and Dumbledore (names I got amateurishly mixed), I lost a virginity when I knew what the Muggle was. My curiosity deepened and I was ready to embrace J.K. Rowling's universe. I wasn't a Muggle anymore.And I was glad I waited for so long, I knew I wouldn't get all the names right, I hadn't read the books (I was a teen when the film came out), I wasn't millennial enough to be part of the Harry Potter mania unlike my brother (who's ten years younger) and had his childhood shaped by the bespectacled sorcerer, Pikachu and Lizzie McGuire. I didn't even have the basic curiosity of the average movie lover because I was never into fantasy or movies about magic to begin with. I thought such stories could provide any contrived twist or last-minute Ex Machina simply by toying with their own rules. When a curse can be done or undone, when powers leave no holds barred, what are the stakes? Where's the danger?I'm glad I could undo the curse of my lousy stubbornness and watch for the first time the first opus of the century-defining saga 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone'. I enjoyed every bit of it and I found it a charm I knew was going to fade over the course of my discovery. You know when you look back to the first movies. I suspected the tone was going to get darker as the kids grow up, as JK Rowling got more confidence in her success and didn't try to make something trendy or fun. So I savored the first film not as a franchise starter, but like as a standalone, charming fantasy movie, confident that Chris Columbus was the right director and that every cast-member was the right choice.Cast-wise, the director respected Rowling's condition before selling the book's rights so the film is a roll-call of all established British and/or Irish actors: Richard Harris as the Merlin-like wizard Dumbledore, Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagol, scene-stealing Robbie Coltrane as the gentle giant Hagrid, the one who gratifies us with every information we'd need to let the plot move on despite a catchphrase that consists of 'I shouldn't have said that'. Also starring John Hurt, Alan Rickman, Richard Griffith, Ian Hart, Fiona Shaw, and three baby-faced newcomers named Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint.The film is a school-case of how to get the right actors to play the right parts... and that goes for the little ones. If you examine the child actors, they're not perfect but never is the imperfection undermining the believability of their characters: they're kids with magical powers so we have to consider that their normal behavior is also conditioned by such abilities. And maybe that was the core of Harry Potter's appeal, ordinary children dealing with extraordinary powers. When they listen to advice, they know more than anyone the extent of the danger awaiting them... when they learn tricks or magical spells, they can't be too excited either, they learn it like stuff they would teach you in class.The adult actors convey the perfect mix of normality-within-strangeness. In fact, the whole film is about an extraordinary world showed in the most mundane and matter-of-factly way, and the reason why it works so well is the same as comedy. Comedies don't feature people making other people laugh, actually, seeing someone angry can be the funniest thing. Fantasy works the same way, you can't have characters being impressed every second, let the viewers do all the wowing... but then again, Harry Potter is the newcomer so he represents our own perspective, he's got that capability to be impressed, to enjoy his powers like a 'normal' child would do.And that's the charm of the film: we're amazed at the magic and at Harry's own amazement, it finds the right balance between fantasy and 'reality' in every single department: acting, storytelling and naturally set design. Hogwarts Schools looks like your typical British school with its high walls, Victorian decorations and Dickensian interiors but never exactly feels like a haunted mansion. There are also sscenes set in plain daylight with a comforting blue sky like the brooms training and the unforgettable Quidditch game.And here and there, you have a few effects to keep you on guars. There's a scene where Harry Potter opens a book and I got my first jump scare, I like that this scary gag isn't overplayed, one is just enough, like Ebert said: it is scary but not too scary. The story never lets itself being dependent on 'effects', and cares about Potter and his friends above everything else, providing him a promising backstory, explaining his scar on the forehead, his magical gift and why he's got a nemesis already.On a side note, 2001 was a terrific year for the fantasy genre as it saw the release of three successful franchise: 'Shrek', 'The Lord of the Rings' and 'Harry Potter' as the most family-friendly. I read about the title's translation that the producers were afraid to use 'Philosopher' instead of 'Sorcerer'. I think they should used the French title; 'Harry Potter and the Wizard School', that was catchy enough without being too misleading.",9,1,2,11 November 2018
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Not kids' stuff anymore...
","Starting with a frightening gallery of skulls out of which emerges a menacing snake, the first shots of 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire', directed by Mike Newell, are already tainting the atmosphere with an unusually disturbing darkness. Yes even by Hogwarts' standards, there's something quite unsettling in the opening flashback.From the perspective of an elderly gardener, we see a young man mentioning the name of Voldemort while leaning his head over a cradle whom occupant needs no hinting. The ugly sight of Peter Pettigrew makes the instant connection with the previous film. Finally, a snake seals the fate of the poor gardener who's zapped from existence in a lightning flash that reveals it was a vision from Harry Potter all along. A grown-up Harry.And this time he's already in good company as it's Hermione who awakens him with Ron not too far. From the absence of the Dursleys, I felt the saga reached a point of maturity that allowed it to start without the usual preliminaries. And the film does make quite an impression from the start, showing Harry and his friends at the Quidditch World Cup, a part that made me expect an orgy of CGI-loaded acrobatic stunts.Yet just when I thought the film was going to exhaust itself with special effects, the chapter is abruptly closed with the interference of the Death Eaters, frightening creatures who look like the kind of minions Voldemort would have and whose sense of fashion remind of some triple-lettered Organization. When Harry was knocked over and woke up in a landscape of ashes and desolation, I was confused. Why would the film set us to such exciting game just to cut instantly into it?Well, technically, the part represented 200 pages in a book four times longer and it wasn't much an adaptation as it was a compression of a story of epic proportions, a story whose length was probably justified by its key significance in Harry Potter's canon. The film could have worked perfectly without the World Cup but it' a memorable moment nonetheless and it ends on the ominous note of a skull and snake forming in the sky, to keep us on guards before the return to Hogwarts.Then the tone changed so drastically I couldn't see where this was leading to. I guess there's a reason why these films are so long. Now, I don't know exactly if I should go into the Triwizard contest hosted by Hogwarts or that final act directly. I guess both work for the exact same purpose as they highlight the maturity of the main characters from the first crushes that start to titillate their hormones to their studies. The contest offers a perfect backdrop for what constitutes a great blending between the high school movies and Harry Potter's usual formula, adding new layers of complexity... with the same old recipes.So for one hour and half, we see Harry battling a dragon, trying to decrypt a message, learning new secrets from the new Defense Against Dark Arts Teacher Alastair 'MadEye' Moody, you know... routine stuff. In the meantime, we also see him asking a girl out, getting into a feud with Ron... we see Hermione finally blossoming into the beautiful girl that never fooled us and Neville getting more confident. It's all the more natural that the Hogwarts regulars (Dumbledore, Hagrid...) are relegated to the periphery of the story. Kids are growing up indeed. We finally discover that Hogwarts had its jock all along in Cedric Diggory (a pre-'Twilight' Robert Pattinson) a nice and popular kid who's so perfect I knew he would be involved in some dark twist. How wrong I was while still being right!So the middle-act while spectacular, exciting and full of intriguing subplots, i rather conventional and not without a few loose ends... but it culminates with a last event taking place in a maze and whose final outcome is Harry and Cedric grabbing the trophy that turns out to be a Portkey and then transports them in a setting we've never seen before and well, what goes after is the kind of 'thing' I could not have guessed coming. While processing the ending, it all makes sense, it's all been leading up to that point. I said about 'Chamber of Secrets' that it made the first film feel like an appetizer, well that's what 'Goblet of Fire' does for the first three movies.Indeed, it was time for Harry Potter to meet his nemesis Voldemort... and he makes quite an entrance in Ralph Fiennes, whose traits, voice, mannerisms and hideous face truly match the fear he's been inspiring during the previous films. The shock coming from his reveal and the death that goes with it announce us the real path the adventures of Harry Potter are taking as we have to accept the imminence of a confrontation between the forces of Evil and the Good. Yes, the series is taking huge mythical proportions... but are we surprised?I said that 'Azkaban' put the franchise at cruising speed, I should have waited till I saw 'Goblet of Fire', it was merely a take-off and while the film just feigns excitement and fun, harboring the usual stuff of action-adventure and youth oriented film with all the usual manufactured special effects, all these elements are instantly disclosed with that final act whose erupting violence totally justifies its PG-13 rating.Yes, there's quite a gulf between the first and the fourth opus and even the audience is expected to be mature enough to handle the secret that goblet of fire is hiding. 'Goblet of Fire' is a departure from the tone of the previous films and can be regarded as both a masterpiece of direction and... misdirection.",10,1,1,19 November 2018
Three Colors: Blue," 'It's only after we've lost everything that we're (almost) free to do anything.'
","Freedom is a beautiful word but 'Blue' deals with the kind of freedom we'd rather not confront once, the one born from the rejection of all achievements, possessions and items of meaningfulness that defined our life... after a tragedy struck.Julie loses her husband and daughter in a car accident. She tries to commit suicide but living is too strong a call to be ignored, she spits out the tablets and apologizes to the nurse for breaking a glass. Later, she sells her property, gets rid of her fortune and starts a new life with what's at hands: anything but the past that would drown her in an ocean of melancholy. The only concession to the past is that Julie knows she'll never be happy.And so she moves to some random apartment in Paris and has an affair with the man she knew was in love with her. This is the freedom she doesn't enjoy as much as she undergoes it in a sort of survival and cathartic move. Whether it's truly freedom is left to debate, but we're never left with the feeling that Julie is seeking joy, maybe contentment, acceptance and pinches of satisfaction here and there. So life goes on and appease wounds but allows a few corridors to the past, weakening that fragile 'rebirth' edifice.And I guess the appeal of 'Blue' relies on that very fragility, one that only Juliette Binoche, one of the sweetest and most delicate faces of French cinema could portray. Binoche is so great an actress that even her expressionless moments deliver the right amount of emotionality. She never looks totally happy, nor totally sad, but always at the verge of two totally opposite emotional directions, whatever they are. She's walking on a tightrope with the past acting like gravity and the wind of present blowing, she can only move forward, never look down, any step back and it's the big plunge.This is not a character but a feeling's study, a remarkable exploration of the complexity of a brave soul from Krzysztof Kieslowski. The late Polish director uses many shots that emphasize Julie's perspective: a close up on a sugar cube absorbing the coffee, a fight seen from her balcony, a street flutist, an old lady with a stooped posture, a family of mice found in the new house. Like the sugar cube, Julie absorbs all these encounters as micro-experiences and then drops everything, never letting any encounter rooting in her life, she finds comfort in the vacuum of the present.It's easy to regard 'Blue', the first opus of the famous 'Three Colors' trilogy as an auteur film without a tangible plot but with an introspective look on life. The film might strike as too slow, too contemplative, too bizarre in its editing but it could only work as long as Binoche was consistent with her character... and she always was, as a woman who, unlike Blanche Dubois, depends on the comprehension of strangers. Life has been so unkind to her she can deal without kindness and this is why she has no scruples throwing her husband's last opera partition (composed for some European Union ceremony) in a waste truck. But maybe Art is too great a thing not to survive and Kieslowski the storyteller can't side anymore with his muse and allow the music to resurface in the story.In the end, it's up to Julie to accept that she can't pretend her past doesn't exist because her husband affected so many lives and those lives still depend on him. There's an arc in Julie's journey in the way she cancels out a few clauses of her existential pact after realizing the way her selfishness deprived people from something that meant a lot in their own lives. The director is too passionate an artist to have a great piece of music being sacrificed, even in a fiction, and there might be a symbolic parallel between the posthumous oeuvre and one baby leaving in the womb of a mistress. Life like the show must go on... and perhaps the greatest triumph of Julie would be to face the present without pretending the past doesn't exist.I think it's a film about grief more than any exhilaration of freedom. The photography is always intimate even in the external shots, served by a beautiful cinematography, exploring any possibility to paint the screen in a shade of blue (a swimming pool, emerald stones, a blue room). But beyond all these photographic tricks and this is coming from someone whose favorite color happens to be blue, the story was so absorbing that I could find a whole world in Binoche's blue performance. Whether it was intentional that the 'Blue' opus would be that sad I don't know but it's a film that I won't forget any soon... not on a personal level. As a father, I can't imagine how unbearable life would be if something ever happened to my daughter. I don't know if I'd be as tough as Julie, but I guess I would try to find a way.It's a cathartic experience indeed, difficult and serious but short enough to sustain that heaviness in gravity. I won't forget that shot where Julie is in fetal position in the swimming pool, she doesn't sink, doesn't float, doesn't swim, she resists like a baby in the mother's womb... waiting for the miraculous rebirth, as a woman without a past. At the end she's a woman with a past and a future, reconciled with time and able to let a timid smile slip from her face. Just because tears are flowing all over your eyes doesn't mean life isn't worth a little smile, after all.There's probably a lot to say about 'Blue' but let's just see what's behind 'White' now, the story about equality... though I suspect it will rise above these values' gimmick and be another powerful statement about something about life. We'll see...",9,0,0,22 March 2019
Castle in the Sky," Maybe too 'typical' of Miyazaki's work to be appreciated on its 'atypical' level...
","'Castle in the Sky' is the eighth Hayao Miyazaki I discover and discover is the word, because despite the patterns you start noticing from one film to another, each one carries a mark of uniqueness like a sacred crystal amulet of its own.And the more I see his work, the more routinely (I must confess) my amazement grows. I don't even watch them in chronological order and it doesn't affect my judgments, 'Nausicaa' looked more accomplished than 'Porco Rosso' or 'Kiki' and while not being as sophisticated as 'Mono-noke', 'Ponyo' hit a more sensitive chord. Now, what can I say about 'Castle in the Sky' without being taken in a maze of hackneyed and boring superlatives? Let me think a littleWell, I'll borrow a compliment Roger Ebert made about Wes Anderson, which I think applies perfectly for Myazaki: the Japanese master's mind would be a wonderful place to visit, it seems that even animated frames are too limited, too small a space to carry all the expansive range of ideas that can flourish out of his imagination. 'A Castle in the Sky' is only his third animated feature and yet it is so close to an unprecedented level of animated perfection even on the field of storytelling, it is so rich your own mind can lose track. I guess I could have said the same about 'Nausicaa', you've got to wonder how he managed to outdo himself one film after another, and he hadn't made 'My Neighbor Totoro' yet. Still, I can see in 'Totoro' or even 'Kiki Delivery Service', a desire to get back to a simpler story-line, and not to my displeasure because this is the kind of plot I enjoy more in Miyazaki. 'Castle in the Sky' is nothing short of a masterpiece but I have a soft spot for his character-driven movies. Miyazaki is never as hypnotic and impressive when his frames are more in states of contemplation, as if they were in an awe of their own material. Of course, action is outstanding, and Miyazaki had already demonstrated that he mastered the sky as the background to thrilling fights and chases, showcasing a level of dedication that only Disney movies can compete with (barely) but Miyazaki, the spiritual man, the poet, is so capable of transcending the limits of action that some parts from 'Castle in the Sky' are too unsurprising especially since they came after 'Nausicaa'. To be fair though, there's more to enjoy than a series of chases in the air starting with the heroine. I loved the way the character of Sheeta didn't duplicate the 'Nausicaa' model, she's not a fighter but a simple girl who hides a secret, symbolized by a mysterious amulet.And even the revelation about her regal ancestry doesn't turn her into some kick-ass heroine. Miyazaki doesn't insult his audience's intelligence, while Nausicaa had her skills from the start, Sheeta is really caught in a coming-of-age narrative. The second character Pazu, a boy working in a mine factory, is eager to follow her, embodying the adventurous spirit of childhood (he's like Fio in 'Porco Rosso' and Tombo In 'Kiki') but his lack of experience makes him commit some blatant mistakes in judgment, he's just a kid after all. As a matter of fact, even the big bad pirates from the start are only kids when confronted to their bossy and experienced mother Dola, who's like a mixture between Ma Baker, Agnes Skinner, Grandma Addams and Captain Hook. I loved all the peripheral characters... from those who brought up the comedic element the film would have severely lacked to Uncle Pomme who provided the obligatory Miyazaki moment of meditation of the virtues we should all treasure from Earth. Miyazaki has covered the sky, the sea and the earth, he's indeed the most environmentalist director ever and 'Castle in the Sky' combines the idea of earth with the spiritual elevation through the castle of Laputa, a legendary city whose name was borrowed from Gulliver's Travel and that used to rule over the world and incarnate the boundless ambition of men. The antagonist, Prince Muska wants to take a hold of the amulet to be the Earth new ruler. He's helped by a whole army and a giant robot who reveals the first inspiration of Miyazaki, French masterpiece 'The King and the Mockingbird', which could have been called 'Castle in the Sky'.The film belongs to the complex realm of Miyazaki's stories, with so many layers you've got to keep yourself pretty focused to enjoy it. In fact, it's perhaps the one flaw I can concede to this particular film, it requires a certain conscience of the inspiration, understanding before enjoyment, and two hours of such deep and rich writing might be too difficult for younger audiences. I'm not implying that this is a film aimed for children as it provides a sweet and a nice friendship story between a boy and a girl so it would be a shame if children missed that story. Miyazaki has always been an expert when it came to concoct mixtures of mature and inspiring material. This time, the film flies in many directions before we can identify the main plot line, and there are a few disorienting changes of tone. It's all visually rich and entertaining but I didn't feel as engaged as in the previous movies, if not the best Miyazaki, it was probably the one with the best potential. Which might explain why there's another Miyazaki named 'Howl's Moving Castle'.",8,1,1,12 September 2017
The Shape of Water," And the Academy bit the bait...
","As a Best Picture winner, 'The Shape of Water' is a most interesting choice, but I wonder if the Academy voted for the sci-fi spy thriller and its interspecies romance between the mute Eliza (Sally Hawkins) and the mysterious fish-man or the art-house movie channeling Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Alexandre Desplat whimsical Oscar-winning score à la 'Up'. I liked the content but there was something too bait-y on the surface to make me fully admire its merit.Speaking of the Oscars, let me start with my first gut-reaction: I wish Michael Shannon was nominated instead of Richard Jenkins, he played the kind of villains that make the difference in a movie, I enjoyed every minute of his screen presence, as Head of Security Strickland, he was creepy, intimidating (he also made a terrific entrance) but there was something in his attitude that betrayed a deep, almost childish, desire to be a perfect citizen, a good soldier, who'd never disappoint his superiors... I figured he represented the infantilizing of American manhood through hardcore and blind patriotism, a way to show that no matter how strong and almighty men felt these days, they were still submissive.Women are depicted as submissive but not as a choice, simply out of practicality in a still male-dominated America (those were the early 60s) but then they reveal themselves to be more dependable than men, it's interesting that the Octavia Spencer's character Zelda never betrays her friend, it's her husband, the guy who'd asked her to open the door who reveals himself as a coward. What I don't get though is whether Zelda was really going to let Strickland rip everything apart and not say a word, we'll never know, the film finds the perfect shortcut, the bad guy gets to Eliza but it's not Zelda's fault. It didn't make sense by the way that the husband wouldn't even let Zelda warn her friend... so I think the film had a little record to settle with men in general.There are basically three good characters of male persuasion in the film: the fish-man, who's said to have everything at the right place though it doesn't look like he's got it, there's Jenkins' character Giles who's a misunderstood artist and attracted to men, which makes him twice an outcast and there's Michael Stuhlbarg's Hoffstetter, a good physician but trustworthy to a limit as his real name's Dimitri. It's interesting that the only three good men live in a sort of duplicity, deliberate or not, they're never what they claim to be and what they are inside, they're forced to hide it. Women are straight-forward but good men are driven into pretending to be what they're not, as if the reality of men was one of ugly nature. And when you have a film that handles an Alien species, it's comprehensible that 'Man' belongs to the antagonistic side but women are certainly not part of that 'Man' equation. Interesting.One could even argue that Jenkins' character didn't want to help his friend Eliza first, until he realized how 'different' he was. In the scene where he gently pats the restaurant guy's hand and realizes that he crossed the line, you can see the young man making a 180° turn and going from a smiling guy to a dirty bigot, homophobic and much more racist since he tells the Black couple to get out, that's the reality of men, whether American or Russian, it doesn't make any difference. So obviously Del Toro is also putting a few baits for the feminist wave, and the janitor job is eloquent: it's literally the women who clean the men's 'dirty work'. Still, for all his efforts, he still got that comment from Portman when she nominated all the *male* directors in the Golden Globes ceremony, apparently, it didn't please Del Toro, but he should be good sport; If 'The Shape of Water' tried to mix fantasy and sci-fi material with the current 'man vs. woman' issues, it's only fair that these considerations interfered with the Awards race.Now, did I like the film?I liked Strickland because he drove the action, so yes, I liked the narrative. I thought the nomination of Jenkins was unnecessary but Octavia Spencer's was outrageous, I swear she plays the same role whenever she's nominated, and when your friend is a mute woman, it's not difficult to be a scene stealer, Sally Hawkins was impressive not much because of her silent performances but the way she dedicated herself to that role. Let's face it, she's not a natural beauty but she really made herself more beautiful than any other pretty face of Hollywood by being a gentle, nice and most of all, decent woman.Now, my real problem is with Del Toro, no pun intended, I thought he was trying to swim in too many waters at the same time: he makes a beautiful romance and it works, a cat-and-mouse thriller, it works, but when the film gets too cutesy and poetic, I'm afraid he loses his guidance. As I mentioned it in the intro, yes, his film reminded me of Jeunet's world, from 'Delicatessen' to 'Amelie', yes, they give a specific texture to the universe of Eliza, old fashioned and kitschy looking, but a little less could have been more. What happened to Del Toro reminds me of Gilliam when he gets carried away by his own extravaganza... in 'The Shape of Water', when Eliza gets naked in the water, it's simple, sensual and powerful... when she imagines the Broadway musical, it's just too much.At the end, it's like Del Toro having the same childish desire to seek approbation from his peers that he tries to make an art-house movie out of what could have been a terrific thriller and a great romance. I didn't mind the 'social commentary' aspect but for that, I found the 'Billboards' film to be more powerful and more deserving of the Best Picture Oscar.",7,4,5,4 July 2019
The Untouchables," Not 'Untouchable', but still better than many better films ...
","Paraphrasing Jimmy Malone, I would say that Brian De Palma's 'Untouchables' fulfilled the basic rules of cinematic entertainment. But when a film had so many natural predispositions for greatness, this isn't saying much.First, the strengths. The costume design and the restitution of the 30's Chicago is so authentic that some beautiful panoramic shots make you feel like traveling back to the prohibition years, on that level, the film is the triumph of meticulous perfectionism and sense of detail conceded even by the most virulent detractors. The direction works, though trying sometimes to impress with unnecessary dizzying shots. De Palma, after all, proved to be a great director for such intense films as 'Carrie' or 'Scarface', with his unique ability to oscillate between calm and suspenseful moments to extraordinarily effective outburst of bloody violence, conveyed by the beautiful part-thrilling part-haunting score by Ennio Morricone. The movie was handled by professionals who knew their business and had everything to be one of the best.But it needed one thing: a script, a kick-ass one with the guts and the energy that Oliver Stone masterfully injected in the veins of 'Scarface'. The movie had the heart but not the passion, the instinct but not the soul. You know something is wrong when you can predict a line or a reaction, when the Mounty Police chief expressed his disagreement, I saw the 'You're not from Chicago' coming, and even the last line, a damn good one, had the forced look on that journalist's face as if he was thinking 'God, what a bad-ass, that Elliott Ness!' By the way, that journalist had a strange ability to point his nose at any convenient occasion until he became an annoying running gag. Still, despite some embarrassing wastes of good lines, it's easy to put that into perspective.In fact, the script sinned more on the characterization and storytelling department, it lacked that spicy something that elevates and develops both the characters and the story in a symbiotic manner. Take Elliott Ness, played by Kevin Costner, more than any inner quality, he certainly owes his appeal to his pretty boyish look and his belonging to the right side of the right side of the law at a time where most of Chicago's police officers were on Al Capone's pay-roll, and the scenes involving his wife and daughter didn't even help. His combat against Al Capone lacked this tormenting desire or internal conflict that would enrich Ness' personality and erases this 'civil servant'-type devotion to duty. At the end, he exuded a sort of naive vulnerability and 'boy-scouts' innocence, that I ended up rooting for him. He was like the kid who wanted to be the hero ... but I didn't snob the pleasure to root for him, especially the film made it clear that it didn't intend to be a masterpiece.Now, to the shadowy guy on the poster's top. The trailer starts with 'Robert De Niro is Al Capone', this sentence enough probably helped to guarantee half of the movie's success : one of the most respected and bas-ass actors at the peak of his career, portraying the most iconic gangster. De Niro was the 'AL'ibi for his antagonist's dull-Ness, but the trailer was still misleading. I love De Niro but he was too comical for such a serious film, and I can't think in all seriousness that he really expects us NOW to take this role seriously. I try to repress some aberrations my eyes witnessed, like a villainous grin in his face while reading the news of Ness' first flop. Though every actor is allowed to some mistakes, we can't blame everything on the script. But let's not be so severe, the movie had the villain and the hero it deserved, one over and one under the top, canceling out each other's negative effects through an improbably harmony. Both were interestingly nominated for AFI's Top 100 'Heroes and Villains' list, no need to mention that neither was selected.But these considerations hardly matter for despite all these technical faults, the movie kind of redeems itself once we mourned the masterpiece it could have been and start enjoying an innate greatness hidden beneath these campy elements. The pillar of 'The Untouchables' is without a doubt the scene stealing performance of Sean Connery as Jimmy Malone, and I don't even care of the accent. I'm not supposed to tell between Scottish and Irish accents (well I do, but he could as well have had a Cuban accent), I hate to kill my enjoyment of a film for such superficial and so-called purist issues, especially when it's not significant to the plot. Connery had the best lines, the best scenes, and was the true leader of the group. Honourable mention by the way to the other untouchables : Charles Martin Smith as Oscar Wallace and Andy Garcia as 'George Stone'.The other highlights of the film occur in many unforgettable scenes, one featuring a dinner table and the other, a train station, proving De Palma's directing ability to create suspenseful situations with the patience and talent of a craftsman. The film proved that for the depiction of cinematic violence, De Palma deserves more than a honorable mention. So I guess people went hard on his film because they expected much more, because he had everything to make a masterpiece out of the Prohibition, and avenge 'Once Upon a Time in America'. I simply hope that those who criticize 'The Untouchables' for being over the top, campy or laughable, start looking at 'Scarface' with a more serious eye and realize its greatness in comparison.Anyway, if the movie is victim of the Costner syndrome, as becoming the cool-to-be-hated thing, it also became one of the most famous gangster films ever, despite or thanks to its flaws, who knows? 'Miller's Crossing' is certainly better on every level, but I sure will watch 'The Untouchables' instead, anytime.",8,3,4,2 September 2011
The Godfather: Part III," The 'Fredo' of the Godfather Trilogy ...
","It's funny how some personal circumstances are the key elements that influence our judgment. In my case, 'The Godfather Part III', was not the last opus of a magnificent saga, but the first film I watched from the trilogy, my first encounter with the Corleone Family, a cinematic love story that would never end.Speaking of love, I always wondered how a movie like 'The Godfather Part III' had crystallized so much hatred and disdain. The unforgettable 'Never hate your enemies, because it clouds your judgment' is like a self-defense cry, from a film that wanted so much to be respected like its glorious predecessors, but apparently failed to, for even the fans will always concede after they say how the movie is great  'but not as great as the two others' So, as a fourteen-year old kid, I loved 'The Godfather Part III', I couldn't complain about the absence of Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen. I wasn't mature enough to judge Sofia Coppola's acting abilities though I found something physically odd in her. From Michael's relationship with Kay to his haircut, 'Part III' was my reference. And I guess I loved the movie for what it was: a great story with an unforgettable climax.Till now, I can't watch the ending, even the clip, without crying, it broke my heart the first time, and it always does, even after so many viewings. It was like I felt the devastation of a man whose life's only meaning was incarnated by his children, his only inspiration in his quest of redemption. And it's ironically the very part that kind of redeems the film, even for the non fans. The others deserving to be mentioned are Michael Corleone's sadness while hearing the 'Brucia La Terra' song played by his son, and his heart-breaking confession of Fredo's murder  The film is about the redemption of a man who sinned so many times. Many would argue that his sins were necessary because they were the only ways to maintain the interests of his family, but hell is paved with many good intentions, and the way Michael ended at 'The Godfather Part II', a ruthless cold-blooded zombie-like figure was demanding a sequel. The last shot of him, sitting alone in the park plunged viewers in a lot of interrogations and interpretations. What was he thinking? Probably, how he got in such a situation, and how this would end. And it's like Coppola, tortured by his own demons, felt there was more to do with Michael Corleone.And the character's arc was concluded, with nothing I would reproach in Michael's portrayal, he's tired, sick as he had carried the weight of a lifelong guilt that ravaged his soul. He may be too pathetic, too different from the Michael we know,his use of profanity was quite out-of character, but who knows how killing his own brother could affect someone. Michael is still respected and feared, but is more melancholic, explaining how the movie needed to be driven by more active supporting characters. And after I finally watched the two other films, one year later  my opinions were mixed.First, I was fascinated by the sight of young War hero, Michael Corleone, in Connie's wedding, it was so contrasting with the pitiful diabetic Mike of the third opus, watching Part I was an extraordinary discovery, a refreshing experience. Besides, the gallery of new characters, Sonny, Tom, Clemenza, Tessio, enriched the film and made it even more entertaining, Part II confirmed my fascination. And step by step, when I started to watch the first two a little more and while I was sharing my opinions on the Net and learning about Part III's reputation, flaws were becoming more visible: Sofia, Duvall's absence and replacement by that Hamilton guy who was certainly not to Hagen what Pentangelli was to Clemenza, the helicopter scene etc. And the reading of the book made me wonder why they chose as the successor, Sonny's illegitimate son.But if the film could have been better, it also could have been worse. And when I watch it, I'm more generous, as I see the tragic ending of one of the most fascinating character's story, a man who's always been 'pulled back in'. The movie respects the spirit of Part I, with a succession on the Corleone's throne, true historical events as back-stories, and so many unforgettable lines. In fact, we can make a parallel between the trilogy and the Corleone brothers: <ul><li>The Godfather is like Sonny : fierce, brutal, yet tender and good-hearted, it's entertaining and deep in the same time. And we all just love 'Sonny' ...</li></ul><ul><li>The Godfather Part II is Michael : deeper, darker, smoother, yes, even 'boring' sometimes, but it's more implacable and ruthless ... we can't love it with the same intensity as the first opus, but we respect the cinematic achievement, and it leaves us with an extraordinary feeling. It's not the most entertaining, but certainly the most fascinating.</li></ul>And of course ...<ul><li>The Godfather Part III is Fredo : it tries too much, it has a good heart but it's weak and even sometimes 'stupid' but hey, it's still a blood brother of the first two films, we still feel Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola's touch and it features some heartbreaking moments, like Michael's silent scream that will haunt me forever. Some magnetism was lacking from the very start, but can we really hate 'Fredo'? </li></ul>I'm sure those who prefer the first film also appreciate the last one and those who love the second film and think it's the best one, identify so much with Michael that they hate 'Part III', with the same intensity and severity Michael expressed towards Fredo. They don't forgive any mistake ... and consider the last film a disgrace for the trilogy, and symbolically disown it.",8,12,18,20 May 2011
Mystic River," The tragedy within the tragedy of life might be its total randomness
","Who said 'what doesn't kill you makes you stronger'? Indeed, life is all about taking hits, but if often happens that the hits hurt less than the idea that we could have easily avoided some of them. A man crippled by a road accident might not blame his driving but what caused him to drive that very day. This 'thinking' can cripple a soul even worse than a body. 'Mystic River', Clint Eastwood's minimalist masterpiece, is a harrowing odyssey over the lives of tortured souls affected directly or indirectly by tragedy and the cruel arbitrariness of life.The movie opens in blue-collar Boston quarters. Three kids: Dave, Sean and Jimmy are playing hockey on the road and sign their names in wet cement. Two men posing as cops approach them, they take Dave in the car, supposedly to send him to his parents and teach him a lesson. Whatever happens to Dave after and however it derailed the trajectory of his life is ominously suggested by the unfinished name in the cement. Sean and Jimmy were so close to their neighborhood that the two sexual predators didn't take any chances with them, but a piece of their soul went with Dave in that car, and the adults they'll turn out to be won't emerge totally unscathed from that 'incident'.'Mystic River' was adapted by Brian Helgeland from a novel by Dennis Lehane and the beauty in the screenplay lies in the way it doesn't fool us by offering answers, men's actions can be as irrational as life itself, but it allows us to grasp why sane people can act in irrational ways, making mistakes out of misguided instinct, past experiences or even love. Clint Eastwood is too much of a no-nonsense director to make a philosophical statement, we make the conclusions for ourselves and appreciate the film for what it is: a harrowing and poignant human drama, served by tremendous acting. Indeed, this is one of these films where the notion of acting ensemble isn't just some awards pundit's darling, even the most unnoticeable character can give you a taste of his life.And the taste never feels as authentic as when Sean Penn and Tim Robbins are in or share the screen, as adult Jimmy and Dave, they are the yin and the yang of 'Mystic River', one has a heart so fueled in anger that it's like a ticking bomb waiting anytime to explode, and his friend carries such a heavy burden that it seems to push him down inside himself. Both actors are equally outstanding in performances that would be considered rather routine. Robbins' uncommunicative behavior speak a thousand words, while Penn well, I've seen scenes of parents learning about the death of their children, but a few has struck me like Penn shouting 'is there my daughter there?' and then simply surrendering to the madness of desperation and shouting. Some would call it over-the-top, it is not, rather over the edge, and when driven to that corner, there's no standard of behavior.The acting and the intensity of the drama make up for the gloomy banality of the location. And there's that hometown flavor, that authenticity conveyed by the story. Penn and Robbins also play married men with children, which is not just some dimension-adding plot device, it means that their character act like men, but also husbands and children, and as pivotal as the Oscar-winning performances of Penn and Robbins were, the wealth is spread to Marcia Gay Harden who plays Dave's wife and Laura Linney playing Jimmy's. 'Mystic River' isn't just about a murder and the police investigation but the ensuing effect on families, about betrayal and loyalty, certitudes and suspicions following the murder of Jimmy's daughter Katie (Emmy Rossum). The procedural seems like 'good cop/ bad cop' routine but even that aspect is handled by Eastwood like state-of-art filmmaking.The investigation is conducted by officers Whitey (Lawrence Fishburne) and Sean (Kevin Bacon). I only mention now the third acting force of the film, because Bacon doesn't play on the same emotional level than his two former friends. He also got his deal of marital troubles, but he tries not to let his past interfere with his judgment. Whitey finds there's something suspicious with Dave who saw Katie shortly before the murder and came back home with a bloody injury on his hand causing his wife, not only to be afraid, but to act afraid, publicly. Dave has a saying about the blood but the absence of proofs, his muddy talking and strange fascination for vampires accentuates his creepiness and slowly turns him into number one suspect. 'Mystic River' is about people's lives intertwining within a tragedy of the present but while the past is sneakily resurfacing, causing an unfortunate streak of actions moved by tragic betrayals and ill-advised loyalty, crazy actions that only make sense within the realm of the opening incident. We're never totally clean, whatever that means. It is very revealing that while dealing with the grief of losing a daughter, Jimmy, who's been a former convict, recalls the childhood episode and the effects it could have had by harming his self-confidence (had he been in that car). Instead, he grew up strong enough to marry a beautiful woman and have Katie and then, Katie was killed. There's a fine line between life questioning and intellectual masturbation. And assuming that Katie turned Jimmy into a better man wouldn't amount much in the scale of the actions he committed out of this very love.'Mystic River' doesn't call for analysis, it is as random as life itself, this is human drama at its rawest and most powerful intensity, directed by Clint Eastwood without any fancy storytelling, it is just things happening to people and people reacting to them. It might be random but it is possible (or is it certitude?) that the tragedy within the tragedy of life is its total randomness",9,0,1,6 March 2017
It's a Wonderful Life," Smile to life and life will smile to you ...
","'It's a Wonderful Life' speaks the most universal truths about the kind of values humanity should stand for to make life that wonderful. It's Frank Capra's Christmas gift to Cinema and one of the all-time greatest classics. Indeed, what we use to define as 'classics' in the Cinematic Dictionary is probably the kind of movies that look and sound familiar to movie fans BEFORE the first viewing. And for me, the great classics as those we're familiar with before watching them and without this parameter affecting the magic of the first experience. We know that Marion Crane will be murdered; that Michael Corleone will become the Don, and that George Bailey will reunite with his family but it NEVER affects the enjoyment.I've seen enough parodies from 'Simpsons' episodes or TV Christmas specials to know the very basis of Frank Capra's immortal classic, I even remember James Stewart's final wink from the movie 'Look Who's Talking', and I was so aware of the film's plot that the first viewing probably consisted on spotting all the references I had. Not that it ruined the whole experience though but I didn't really grasp the inner greatness of the film until the second viewing, and now I do. Yes, it's very positive, very 'good-vibrations inducing', something that definitely justifies its top spot on AFI's 100 Most Inspirational list, but there is more to that. There is more.You see, I've always thought the film to be a Christmas story and nothing else, expecting a 'message'; an obligatory happy ending established by the Family reunion, I expected that and well, I got it. BUT it's surprising how dark it really gets for a Christmas film and even by today's standards, 2000's TV specials can't elevate themselves to this gutsy change of tone. And James Stewart carries it quite spectacularly in 'It's a Wonderful Life', powerfully transcending the initial atmosphere of the film. I would never have expected such genuine and authentic displays of sheer anger and Stewart is really scary here. I recall one line in Ebert's review where he regretted the colorization of the film precisely because it didn't visually fit these dark undertones. I can't imagine myself watching the film in color either.And Stewart's anger is very significant, because it illustrates the overall sentiment conveyed by his character, George Bailey, toward his life. The man considers himself a failure because he didn't fulfill all his dreams of travels and explorations. Sure, all his achievements helped the community, but never did he expect to stay in his modest natal hometown, Belford Falls. Bailey exemplifies the notion of being victim of circumstances, something I could relate to who spends my whole time dreaming of what I wish to do, instead of appreciating what I already did. Seriously, could it be more frustrating than dreaming of the world and be forced to live in a dull small town? Logically, Bailey becomes a bitter man with the eyes so turned to the future that he can't turn his back and consider the extent of his achievements and his popularity. George Bailey reminded of one of my friends' sayings: 'we don't spend our lives writing the future, but writing the past' It's even truer for Bailey whose past (understand: achievement) helped people to build their future. Following the death of his father, he took over the 'Loan and Building' affair and played a significant role in the lives of all the people of Belford Falls by selling houses lower than the prices they would normally rent it, thus providing them the most precious thing in America: a land, a home, with prices low enough to be able to sustain to the other obligations. He naturally made himself an enemy through Lionel Barrymore as the infamous half-tyrant half-tycoon Mr. Potter, a fitting 'Capraesque' villain as the morally corrupted rich man who tyrannizes and despises little people. (Interestingly, both Bailey and Potter are in AFI's Top 10 Heroes and Villains)Frank Capra is one of the few directors whose style became instantly identifiable and 'It's a Wonderful Life' is the opportunity to culminate his own standards but not with the usual emotional bias this time. Here it's Bailey, the very protagonist of the film who takes distance from the little people, too real, too down-to-earth while he is a man who dreams, who writes the future in big, bold letters. This time, the enemy is not just the rich, the powerful, the corrupted, but the hero's inner demons, unknowingly celebrating Capra's humanistic vision: a world of solidarity, brotherhood, goodness and compassion. It's also, cinematically-speaking, the incarnation of a lost era through these characters forever graved in our memories, Mary Bailey (Donna Reed), Uncle Billy (Thomas Mitchell), Clarence (Henry Travers) and all these unforgettable faces.'It's a Wonderful Life' is the coming to realization of a man that he's better than what he thinks he is, and whose achievements speak something more important about him than his dreams. The trick was to allow him to see what his life would've been hadn't he be born: a frightening alternate reality (just noticed where 'Back to the Future II' took its inspiration from). This little spice of fantasy conducts the atmosphere of the climax. And its darkness is perfect because the scarier it'll get, the more convinced Bailey will be. And he finally learns it the 'hard way' but this is the fate of all Capra's heroes, they all struggle, they're all licked and desperate before triumphing. Why so hard? Why the harder it is, the louder the 'YAAY' will be and so will the 'Merry Christmas' shouted while George Bailey is running out of joy, probably the most communicative of Cinema's history.And we wouldn't have had one of the truly happiest happy endings of cinema's history, immortalized by the sight of James Stewart smiling, with little Zuzu, Mary and a thought for his guardian angel.",10,1,2,30 July 2012
A Beautiful Mind," Nash Disequilibrium...
","'A Beautiful Mind' presents all the characteristics of a great film but since it deals with schizophrenia and visual and aural elements that aren't what they seem to be, I wondered sometimes if what I was seeing wasn't just elements of episodic greatness wrapped up in a story that actually had less substantial things to say than what the raving critics pretend it said. Ron Howard used to make movies that worked both on and beneath the surface, but this is a case where many elements of one man's life overlap and generate more confusion than fascination. That it won the Oscar for Best Picture has the same puzzling effect than of a math riddle.The film is a legitimate biopic about one of the most interesting minds of the twentieth century. I'm not sure I would call it 'beautiful', even Einstein didn't get that title, but 'fascinating', it sure was. It belongs to John Forbes Nash, the mathematician and economist who paved the way for a new conception of governing dynamics and competition, less through the theory of games than the notion of equilibrium, the fact that the lesser of two evils is a wiser option than 'everyone for himself'. I'm not being persnickety but I wish the film dedicated more time to his revolutionary work, I studied economics and the 'Nash equilibrium' was one of these lessons that instantly inspired me and I could see countless situations where the genius of Nash was applied.Maybe being a math buff influenced my expectations and I'm perfectly aware that this is only a cinematic adaptation, that Ron Howard or Akiva Goldman (the writer) are entitled to their narrative choices, but I was disappointed to see the 'sick' side of Nash' personality being shamelessly unleashed especially after the superficial treatment his game theory got, though I loved its application on the way to approach women. The second act of the film primarily deals with the diseases that struck that 'beautiful' mind but could have been a more subtle treatment of his mental condition, not just a translation into archetypal cinematic language but something in par with the subtle and realistic way Nash was played in the first act as a graduate student from Princeton whose sociability isn't exactly his strongest suit and his interactions with his co-workers or with women work as efficient comical moments.Indeed, to a fellow recipient of a prestigious Mathematics scholarship (Josh Lucas), Nash slyly declares that he found nothing seminal in any of the articles he wrote, and to a woman, well, let's just that a reference to sexual fluids earned him a nice slap in the face. Russell Crowe is quite convincing as Nash, a guy never looking his straight in the eyes, often down, looking for patterns in everything, and looking forward to having his scientific epiphany. There's a moment where he just lost a Go game and is puzzled because he played the part perfectly, this display of bad loser's spirit would have been more efficient had it not been immediately followed by another one where he throws his office desk from the window, encouraged by his roommate, an imaginary 'literature' student played by Paul Bettany and it seems like the writer was already preparing us for weirdness. This is a film that would have benefited from less spectacular stunts, no matter how supposedly true to Nash' life they were.So, once the article about governing dynamics is published and made a name out of Nash, the film makes a chronological leap where we find him as an MIT teacher. He there meets Alicia, a beautiful student, played by Jennifer Connelly, and if not original, the chemistry is believable. This is where something derails the narrative again, once you get the point that mathematics won't play a part to the story, you accept to get to the intimate life, but then for some reason, the writer decides it's time for us to get to the piece of resistance. Then the film focuses on subplots involving a mysterious agent from Ministry of Defense (Ed Harris) assigning Nash to thwart a Russian plot by finding patterns in newspapers. Then the film turns into some sort of copycat-political thriller with chase sequences and shootouts, that aren't even supposed to be real.The treatment of schizophrenia is so visible, logic and structured that the whole thing loses its credibility, it's on the same level as 'Inception' or the Matrix while I wish it was a bit more like 'Pi', or something that could really be perceived as mental internal, it is a biopic after all. Not that the film is always about Nash's hallucinations but even the rest is an uneven experience, it starts with elements of abstraction that makes you penetrate in the world of Nash, his fascination for patterns, in the sky, but then we're plunged in a succession of archetypal situations that occupy so much of the story every other character becomes just an observer of Nash' deterioration, even Alicia becomes the obligatory long suffering wife without any subtlety. How about having the insight of the one sane person who was the closest to Nash, his wife? Her performance was good enough to earn her an Oscar but it's not the same complexity as in her 'Requiem for a Dream'. As for Nash, we don't see the math genius but the victim of a severe mental condition, but it's handled in such a way it's difficult to care about it. The film is well acted, well directed, but I'm not sure it does justice to the legacy of a man reduced for almost half the film to things that didn't even happen. As spectacular as they were, I don't think they belonged to the film, and maybe, quoting Nash who commented on a bad tie, and after having 'enjoyed' other Goldman's screenplays, there might be a pattern explaining how bad his narrative choices are.",6,0,0,5 June 2017
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Makes the first one feel like an appetizer...
","'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' was an already satisfying meal but 'The Chamber of Secrets' make its feel like an appetizer... and what an appetizing premise its title carries.A second installment that is basically telling you in every frame 'wait a minute, you haven't seen nothing yet' is the kind of offer any movie lover can't refuse. And on that level, let me enumerate a few things 'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets' have: the thrills of an Indiana Jones movie, the CGI expertise of a 'Star Wars', the smooth pace of an Agatha Christie mystery, the whimsicality of a 'Disney', the capability to immerse you into a whole universe like some blockbuster adapted from Tolkien, and yet... it is a straight continuation of the original film, in plot and spirit.And that's the mark of a great franchise: you have a first film that doesn't try to play it for the profits only and then the second that doesn't take the previous success for granted and gratifies the audience with denser and richer material. 'Chamber of Secrets' might be a tad overloaded but things never go overboard thanks to Chris Columbus's alternation between action and mystery... and action is an understatement when you have a flying car, giant spiders and a confrontation with a giant snake that makes the first film's climax feel like a tea party.The mystery part is even more fascinating because it's all built on the first film's established elements: Hogwarts and its four founders, the evil Salazar Slytherin whose true intents were foreshadowed by Hagrid's statement that not all wizards turn out to be good and the fact that some students are Muggle-born like Hermione Granger. The original canvas stays the same but the scope gets bigger, as if the clear picture we had on Hogwarts in the first film turned out to be only the tip of an iceberg, a puzzle with many pieces missing and it's impossible to identify which. But this time, the stakes are high, and even innocent students can be killed... or in the best case, petrified. Yes, the material is pretty heavy.But I guess the choice to make the story darker and edgier was inevitable. In the span of one year only, many kids had their voices broken, they all grew up, Hermione's interactions with the boys get more awkward for obvious hormonal reasons, so they're all fit for more challenging experiences. And guess what? That's probably the secret of the franchise: the audience grew with the characters, which takes me back to my brother who showed me the first film, he was eight when it was released and entered university with the last one. We're talking of life-shaping series, like 'Star Wars' but with more humanity.So yes, for a whole decade, the 'Harry Potter' series defined the word 'Fantasy' and its maturation of tone was almost a natural process. Author J.K. Rowling knew she could go darker in the depiction of Hogwarts; just like a known place that reveals hidden corridors, passageways, chambers or even residents. Things that existed all along but whose absence in the first film could make sense, as these additions never seem contrived... neither do a few coincidental accidents. Magic can work in mysterious ways after all and what goes for locations goes for characters as well.So, in 'Chamber of Secrets', we get a closer look on the Weasley family, we meet the little elf Dobie (Toby Wilson) who looks like a mix of Jar-Jar Binks, Gollum and E.T., a phoenix named Fawkes, Lucius Malefoy, the father of Harry's nemesis, played by Jason Isaacs who once again embodies the expression: 'if looks could kill'. We also meet the closest to a human comic relief as the vain and self-absorbed new teacher Lockhart, played by a hammy Kenneth Branagh and in Moaning Myrtle, the ghost of a young girl played so convincingly, I didn't recognize Shirley Henderson. These new characters are all promising but never given a full VIP treatment, their legitimacy always comes from their interactions with the regulars and I must say the eye stares between Harry and Malefoy were quite chilling.And the good all folks are there, Richard Harris, plays one last time his Albus Dumbledore before his sad passing in 2002, there's also Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane and Alan Rickman but this this time in rather static positions, as if the bizarre shenanigans happening within Hogwarts were scary even by their own standards... which is saying a lot. We suspect everything will be all right by the end yet the suspense is all there and the action too, served by convincing CGI-aided special effects. A few things didn't age quite well but I can imagine how impressive the film is for a theater audience, especially during the final act.Now, it's not indispensable to know the first film but don't expect much exposition: as soon as it starts, Harry knows the place he belongs to (remember his reluctance to go back home at the end of the first), he knows the extent of his power and his friendship with Ron and Hermione. He knows his place and he knows... well, he doesn't know everything and the film turns all his interrogations to plot-driving elements and interesting unveilings of backstories, secret identities, some good, some evil, not to mention those hints you only get after several viewings.Now, I probably missed a few things but I suspect I'll never know the series as much as I handle 'The Godfather' or 'Back to the Future' but you don't watch all movies the become an expert, do you?(On a side note, there is one shock during the film that proves that back in 2002, people didn't make a fuss about boys or girls being equally heroic. Not sure the plot point involving Hermione would have been used today. That's how 'old' the film is)",8,1,1,14 November 2018
The Departed," A solid cat-and-mouse thriller but a disappointing Scorsese's film ...
","Now, this is a film I wanted to love. I have a profound admiration for Scorsese which I consider among the best, and probably the most consistent directors, the one who never failed to surprise me in each of his brilliant movies. But if I liked 'The Departed' as a solid cat-and-mouse thriller, I reckon I expected much more from Marty, and the last 10 minutes of the film confirmed my disappointment.<ul><li>The ending : sure it was one hell of a totally-unexpected climax, sure we already had a first taste of the movie's level of violence, but I had the strange feeling Scorsese let himself go with such 'delightful' visual effects -to create the most gruesome head shots with the most graphic blood splattering- that he forgot the story. It was so repetitive it almost became comical. At one point, I was thinking 'Ok, who's next now?' It was just like watching a film set in a big city, and at the end, a big atomic bomb destroys everything and everyone is dead. Okay, I knew, this wasn't the kind of police dramas where the good guys would win  I even knew about the elevator scene, but just because something is unexpected and shocking, doesn't make it acceptable. I felt cheated. What's the point of engaging the viewer if it must end in such an abrupt way. Or is it supposed to show harsh reality, in an almost documentary-like style? Well, I expected more depth from a Scorsese film, maybe more poetry. He's one of the greatest film-makers of all-time, and this film left me cold.</li></ul><ul><li>The cast : Jack Nicholson did a good job, but I would have loved to see De Niro playing this part. All through the movie, I couldn't stop thinking, why didn't Marty take Bobby for the part? It would've been perfect. Nicholson was good, but he was Nicholson. DiCaprio did a decent job too, but I guess I'm getting tired of seeing him always playing tough guys and banging sexy girls, and I wasn't that impressed by Matt Damon: he was good, but not 'Scorsese' good. And I didn't really care for the other supporting characters who were just your archetypal 'cops and gangsters'. The characterization was OK but would you really compare this to 'Goodfellas'? Consider the female characters; their presence was a convenient plot device, using their sexy tight skirts as a foil for the whole male dominant cliché. Where are the Boxcar Bertha, Karen Hill, Iris etc.? I even missed the annoying Ginger, that's saying a lot.</li></ul><ul><li>The writing : it tries too much, it's too smart, too intricate, too serious, too many characters, too much violence and at the end : no heart, not this emotional extra-push of dutiful sin and tormenting guilt Scorsese used to beautifully depict in his films. This torment I need to find in every Scorsesian character, I found it a bit in Di Caprio, but that made the ending even more depressing because once he died, I didn't care for the rest of the film. This is the kind of originality I hate, just like the Coen brothers thought it would be great to  well, those who've seen 'No Country For Old Men' will know. Here, it's like Marty wanted to make the ending impacting in a stylish way, while there was more to do on the emotional level. All style and no substance. And even the style didn't provide this entertaining energy that made his gangster films so dark and flamboyant at the same time. At the end, 'The Departed' is just a 'film' with a brilliant premise, and a script so smart every single element is used as a clever plot device: if only 2 persons know about Costigan's mission, wouldn't you guess already that something very bad would happen to them? Anyway ... my criticism wouldn't be so harsh if it hadn't won the Best Picture Oscar.</li></ul>I hated the ending for the same reasons I love old-school Scorsese who made masterpieces like 'Mean Streets' and 'Goodfellas', but in 'The Departed': the bloodier it got, the cheaper it was. And this film ended like a self-parody, relying on cheap shocking effects instead of real character developments, or maybe it wasn't a character-based film, but just a cat-and-mouse thriller, then again, it didn't deserve all this praise. I was talking of self-parody, because sometimes a great director becomes like a label, you insert his name in any film, and it's supposed to be a masterpiece. I read Ebert's review and of course, he went again about the same 'torment/moral/guilt/dilemma' analysis. There I knew he was biased, I know Ebert is Scorsese's number one fan, but sometimes this passion blinds him so much he loses the neutrality I'd expect from a critic. To give you an example, I liked 'Casino' a lot, but couldn't help but notice some weaknesses when compared to 'Goodfellas', a too similar plot line, too much narration, an annoying repetitive relationship between Ginger and Ace etc. Those points were highlighted by Siskel, but Ebert, as usual, started to analyze the traditional Scorsesian themes, the Catholic influence etc. That's how I started not to be influenced by Ebert's reviews on Scorsese, I don't blame him though for being unbiased, he has a soft spot for Marty, and I understand that. Marty remains one of my favorite directors, but 'The Departed' is his weakest film, which won an obvious sympathy Oscar. So if this film won the Best Picture Award, fine, but then 'Donnie Brasco' should have gotten more attention, because not only does the movie deal with (basically) the same subject, but there is a human dimension, a relationship between Lefty and Donnie, that makes it something more than your average gangster film. And this originality, this heart, I didn't find while watching 'The Departed'.",6,2,3,2 March 2011
Die Hard," A new kind of heroes, a new kind of villains, a new kind of action films ...
","'Under Siege', 'Air Force One', 'Cliffhanger' or 'Passenger 57'...no action film was like 'Die Hard' before and every action film was like it after: this is the definition of a milestone. And this privileged status has been conquered by John McTiernan, in 1988, through one  no, two masterstrokes : the casting of Bruce Willis as Detective John McClane and Alan Rickman as his archenemy, Hans Gruber. All the Oscar-nominated special effects of the world, spectacular sequences or heart-pounding gun-pointing moments would have been equally worthless if we had to deal with a one-dimensional villain or a heroic killing-machine à la Stallone or Schwarzenegger. No disrespect for Arnie, but his decision to turn down John's part is probably one of greatest blessings of cinema's history, if only for launching the cinematic career of Bruce Willis. But there's more to say in this casting that justifies the iconic status of 'Die Hard'.Bruce Willis introduced a new kind of hero, combining the strength of a regular cop who's been doing that since eleven years, and the qualities of a regular man, with a wife and children. He's charming, but not a womanizer, he's strong but hates to risking a neck-break, he cares for his family, for innocent people and for his duty, but his wisecracking attitude doesn't befit his deeply noble nature. And he has a strange habit to talk to himself, just like we might talk to him, if we could. John McClane is what we could call a buddy-hero, one that immediately inspires sympathy. Any regular guy would like him because he's not an intrepid adventurer like Indiana Jones or the playboy who gets all the chicks like James Bond, and more interestingly, because everybody's against him, even the Police or the FBI. John McClane is the quintessential guy at the wrong place and the wrong moment, the pebble in the shoe, the pain in the ass, whom no one seems to give a break... and if only for that, we identify with him.John McClane is indeed one of the greatest movie heroes, and if this is too pompous a superlative for him, let's say one of the coolest.And for a new kind of hero, the movie needed a new kind of villain. And here comes the suave and charming Hans Gruber, a man who uses his sophistication as a rhetoric trick to hide the true evil and menacing side of his nature. At one part, no one would dare to challenge his opinion on Gruber, for a guy who could lead such a bunch of cold-blooded killers, had to be at least twice more determined and violent than the most violent of them, Carl his sidekick, to name him. As soon as his gun is pointed at you and if you don't have weapons, you're already dead, and be careful if he compliments your suits, it might mean that he'd hate to make some holes in. Hans Gruber, rightfully nominated #46 in AFI's Top 50 Villains, is the kind of villains that would have made Hitchcock very proud, and from Lecter in 1991 to Landa in 2009, a few villains of the last years would lack this mix of suaveness and cruelty.Hans Gruber's influence on villains' characterizations is undeniable and Alan Rickman steals the show in an Oscar-worthy supporting performance, his eyes language is so powerful that most of his reactions could pass for genuinely authentic.But does it take only two iconic characters to make a film? Yes and no. Yes, because once you have the characters, and you define their personalities, their interactions and dynamics will provide enough material for the script. From a memorable 'Now I have a Machine Gun Ho- Ho-Ho' or the 'Yippie-Ki-Yay' catchphrase, the conflict between a regular guy and a foreign mastermind is a cinematic delight. But again, Hans is such an extraordinary character that he even takes distance from his role as the big villain, admitting he borrows more of his knowledge from stuff read in Forbes, or Time. And no, because the movie still needs a story, a back-story, about McClane, his family, to paint him with the brush of realism; there's a scene where he has a breakdown with his only trust-worthy friend and partner (Sgt. Powell, played by Reginald VelJohnson) where McClane takes this unique dimension I was mentioning before. Could you imagine Arnie crying like this?There's also this constant originality in the film that makes every single scene memorable. Action is never for the sake of it, after several viewings, you understand exactly what John is doing and the whole process to save the hostages. And in the same time, we follow the Germans in that cat-and-mouse situation. John is indeed trapped like a mouse, with his vest and bare feet (another unique touch of the film) but sometimes, the mouse even when outnumbered, can use his cleverness, his reactivity, and courage to defeat the bad guys thanks to the surprise effect, and a little something that makes him such a hard nut to crack. Now, of course, the purists will criticize the Germans' accents, the unrealistic incompetence of the Deputy Chief of Police or some useless comedic relief moments, they wouldn't be totally wrong but when we're supposed to believe in a man able to fight a group of terrorist, couldn't we suspend our disbelief a little? This is not too much asking from a masterpiece of entertainment that paved the way to a new conception of hero and villains and a new generation of action movies, almost all of them can be tag-lined as 'Die Hard in someplace'. Indeed, 'Die Hard' gave its letter of nobility to 'pop-corn' and 'guy' movies to a point, I can imagine, a villain saying now, in a monologue 'This time, John McClane won't come here to save the day '",10,1,2,31 October 2011
Psycho," An 'accidental' masterpiece ... and the greatest suspense movie ever ...
","Imagine if Hitchcock retired before the 60's, after all, his filmography was impressive enough to place him among the all-time greatest film-makers. But the Master had a little surprise for those who thought they've been scared enough and could never be surprised again  And how wrong they were  It's admirably surprising that such a great film came so lately in a career when most of the directors generally start losing their touch. But this is only one of the numerous unexpected and fascinating aspects that make this simple film, an 'accidental' masterpiece. And I use this word as a compliment since the greatest masterpieces like 'Casablanca' or 'The Godfather' were unintentional too.The elements that make 'Psycho' a masterpiece could have been taken as cinematic tricks deliberately inserted to create a feeling of originality, but then, such tricks would have sublimated the film, making it even more glorious and 'cinematic', which is not the case here. And I think I loved 'Psycho', for the same reasons I disliked 'North by Northwest'  In the former, Hitch used up all the style until it became a caricature: a too contrived plot, a too heroic ordinary hero, a dull love interest, a grandiose climactic scene  'Psycho' doesn't have this pretentious elegance and almost looks like a TV or a B-movie  it's the less Hitchcokian stylishly, but ironically, the most defining of his films.'Psycho' starts with probably the most thrilling score ever, the linear design combined with the shrill violins' sounds are the perfect illustration of how a music can embody the main feeling of a film, as if Bernard Herrman is already warning us about a horrifying surprise that'll make our hearts pound as fast as this melody  its contribution to the film's emotional impact is indisputable. The next shot transports us to Marion Crane's apartment where we she lies in bed with her lover, undressed and intimate like in a campy soap opera  a lousy apartment with two people without the 'Grant and Kelly' romantic appeal audience got used to. An already classic and politically incorrect start. They're lovers, who probably just had sex, but this is no voyeurism, this is intimacy, a necessary intimacy to feel for Marion, to understand her, to understand her motives for stealing the money in the following scene.Indeed, the way, Janet Leigh portrays Marion Crane, and Hitchcock's intimate directing, creates an incredible feeling of empathy leading to paranoia. When Marion leaves the town, we don't know where she goes exactly, but we're following her totally hooked, like hostages of her fate. When she accidentally meets her boss, we're shocked  and feel her slow descent to paranoia, from the discussion with the police offer, to the car rental service where every hint of nervousness acts like an accusation. That's the brilliance of Hitchcock's script, at that point: there's just the robbery, and Marion's troubles. We fear that she might get caught, totally unaware that this option would have saved her life.The rest is legendary; she meets Norman Bates, a young, easy-going and soft-spoken Motel manager, with nothing suspicious in his approach. He's a bit shy and awkward but this only highlights his 'boy-next-door' attitude. Of course, there's this strident voice that shouts at him every time, those stuffed birds, but when you live alone in such a little and boring place, one must find hobbies. Marion is too exhausted anyway to get suspicious and Anthony Perkins's great acting doesn't suggest the idea, even for us, that he's trying to seduce her, although, they're like forming a cute couple, and we almost expect something happening between them, until Bates reveals to be a voyeur, which shocked me as if I was so close to Marion, I felt like Bates spying on me.We all know the rest of the story, what else can be said? The shower scene is probably the most audacious and shocking plot twist ever committed on screen. It's extraordinary that the character that was driving the film was killed so early. Marion Crane wasn't a supporting character, she was the lead of the first part of the film, and the transfer from Crane to Bates as the new lead of the film is masterfully done. Especially that at this point, Norman Bates is not the official villain of the film, it's like we feel some sympathy for him as he tries to protect his evil mother. We need to feel empathy anyway.But Hitchcock had to surprise us. The film doesn't have one twist but in fact two twists including the classic, shocking revelation of the mother's identity, a shock starting with the sudden appearance of the skull, even scarier than the shadowy figure behind the curtains. This conclusion is the pay-off of a rather normal part between Marion's murder and the climax, saved by a scene-stealing performance by Martin Balsam as Detective Arbogast, a supporting but pivotal character whose annoying perseverance will indirectly solve Marion Crane's disappearance mystery. The film could have disappointed after Marion's death, the shocking revelation places it among the greatest classics.And one thing prevented the film from being perfect, and I can't understand how a director like Hitchcock let himself tolerate such amateurish writing. I'm talking of the shrink scene where during 5 minutes, the characters and the audience make one and quietly listen to Bates' biography, as a text, the screenwriter probably wrote before starting the script. It's like Hitchcock underestimated his audience's intelligence. Didn't we have enough hints? Wasn't the last scene meaningful enough to understand that he suffered from a personality disorder? Thankfully, 'Psycho' overcame many flaws and managed to be the greatest suspense movie ever, thanks to a constant paranoid feeling, two shocking twists, a memorable villain, and an unforgettable score. 'Psycho' is an accidental masterpiece, but it's still a masterpiece",9,0,0,21 March 2011
Rosemary's Baby," Claustrophobia, Paranoia and Farrow Mia ...
","No bleeding, no screaming, no killing, but an absolutely terrifying cinematic experience. In 'Rosemary's Baby', Roman Polanski's horror masterpiece, the terror is induced by two universal feelings that nourished the imagination of our worst nightmares: being alone and being vulnerable. But what's the secret of Roman's 'baby'?Loneliness. 'Rosemary's Baby' conveys a disturbing paranoid feeling all through the film, thanks to Roman Polanski's Hitchcockian virtuosity. He invites us to a cheerful and hospitable space while suggesting its claustrophobic scariness. Space plays a significant part to the story as it's constantly invaded by nosy neighbors and it gets more difficult to escape from it. The apartment which looked so spacious in the beginning, gets smaller as the movie progresses, increasing Rosemary's discomfort and ours. The yellow walls are like the bars of a golden cage keeping Rosemary alone in a suffocating atmosphere ... and still, Polanski's direction is so nuanced that we also consider the possibility of a simple case of paranoia.Anyway, Mia Farrow was perfect as she genuinely embodies vulnerability. She naturally plays a young and sweet woman dreaming of having a baby and living in perfect harmony with her husband, Guy Woodhouse, portrayed by John Cassavettes. But fate lead her to the apartment right behind the Castevets' walls, Roman and Minnie, a peculiar old couple with an obnoxious nosiness. And poor Rosemary is like these shy little creatures who try to remain friendly only to hide their discomfort. Her kindness rhymes with weakness, and as if she was carrying paranoia with her baby, the more certain she'll be about the conspiracy and the necessity to protect her unborn child, the weaker and more vulnerable she'll get. How ironic ... Even the evolution of her clothes, her hair style, her pale complexion indicate a progressive sickness as if Polanski broke a taboo by depicting pregnancy with the same symbolism as for the hostile closed space. Rosemary trapped in the secret and by the secret growing in her ...Rosemary's fragility is beautifully incarnated by the feminine score that accompanies the film, a music like for a cosmetic advertisement, so inconveniently peaceful we figure that there's a horrific element waiting to provide a shocking contrast. But we're only given hints during the film ... the most eloquent being the dream sequence which is so tactfully directed that despite Rosemary's shouting, we really have the feeling that this 'is a dream' and NOT 'really happening'. We have in this scene an excellent direction by the precocious genius Roman Polanski who could have betrayed the movie's terrible secret had he handled this crucial part with a too ambitious approach. No, it was horrific enough to scare us, but surrealistic enough to be associated with a dream. The rest of the film keeps a realism that keeps our guard down, thinking that the secret is only on the surface, or that again, Rosemary may be victim of paranoia  such a brilliantly furnished plot has no room for obviousness.And the 'plot', in every meaning of the word, works thanks to the masterfully constructed script. I was fooled, but I'm glad I was. The originality in 'Rosemary's Baby' is that even the lead character couldn't know about a secret that could only be revealed after the pregnancy. She's both the most and least likely person to know and this is the horrific element driving the last act. It almost starts like Polanski's 'Chinatown' set in an apartment, where we try to put and reassemble the pieces of the puzzle together with Rosemary, inhabited by a new strength : a poignant motherly instinct inspiring her to protect her baby from the claws of the Castevets and the others. The rest is probably one of the most thrilling experiences I've ever had.The whole direction of the film consists on following a poor creature lonely and fragile trying to escape from the influence of many dangerous individuals, that 'All of Them' feeling getting more and more unbearable as no one seems to help her. And the irony is that these individuals, took alone, are quite harmless, especially, Minnie Castevet, played in a delightful performance by Ruth Gordon who deserved her Oscar as the nosy neighbor. And Guy Woodhouse is just a schmuck and an opportunistic bastard. But the strength lies within the group who's like a herd of greedy wolves with Rosemary as the poor little lamb. The story is perfect and totally fit for a horror film and I really believe Mia Farrow's performance should have earned her an Oscar nomination.And how could I describe the famous second where Rosemary's, dressed in her pajamas, sees what's in the cradle ... the way she bugles her eyes and puts her hand in her mouth as to hide a horrific scream is probably one of the most iconic moments ever captured in a horror film. It's the quintessential shocking effect, the conclusion of a great thriller masterfully directed by Roman Polanski, and the end of a torment that was less a relief, than a realization of the degree of evil that could drive people, especially Guy who didn't hesitate to sell his soul to promote his career by providing his own woman's womb for that terrific project.And yet, despite everything, the movie ends in an unexpectedly calm note as to suggest that either the motherly instinct can overcome the evil, either that Rosemary learned that the best she could do was to respond to her motherly duty and rock her baby to sleep  an ambiguity that reveals a secret to announce many others and makes the ending, despite the relief, even more terrifying What's the secret of 'Rosemary's Baby'? It just knows how to keep a secret ...",10,1,2,2 June 2011
When Harry Met Sally...," When Rob Met Nora ...
","If it's romantic and funny, it's a good romantic comedy, plain and simple. On that level, Rob Reiner's 'When Harry Met Sally' is a 10/10 but there wouldn't be much to say and the praise would be more disrespectful than the critic, because obviously, the film tries (and succeeds) to be more than a 'rom-com', it's a very interesting gender relationship study with an undeniable pedagogic value.And this probably is 'When Harry Met Sally' unfortunate dilemma, it succeeds so much on the wit and romance department, that it sometimes undermines the realism of the 'social commentary' aspect. Yes, romantic comedies are not the most likely to depict reality with a documentary-like quality, but the Oscar-nominated script of Norah Ephron proves that sometimes, even intelligence can be incompatible with realism. When you have to conclude by a ' but then, there would have been no film', you know something didn't work.But first, allow me to say that I really love the film, and this has a lot to do with the performances of Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan, who form one of the greatest romantic duos, if not the greatest. Harry is oddly appealing as the lunatic, part-anguished part-self-confident guy, with this poignant mix of macho attitude and vulnerability, while Sally shines as the adorable cute face, constantly smiling and optimistic free-spirited girl, the winning yin to Harry's annoying yang. Harry and Sally are as contradictory as moon and sun, Mars and Venus, both embodying the opposite poles that separate women from men. No wonder that in their first encounter in 1977, they have a problem of communication, especially on the touchiest subject: can a man and a woman be friends, without having sex ruining their friendship.This is the intellectual core that drives the relationship's evolution and since Harry doesn't believe in the non-interference of sex, and since she doesn't like him, both can never be friends. Then they meet again in 1982, where their 'qualities' are even more emphasized, the result is hilariously disastrous but we know it's just a matter of time so they finally get in the same wavelength. And after five crucial years, Harry and Sally's respective divorce and break-up finally relieve them from all their preconceived ideas. Life is build of dreams and experience on disillusions, so the Harry and Sally who meet again in 1987 are the real ones, who can start a nice and warm friendship, cleared from any sexual tension.But Rob Reiner and Nora Ephron aren't fooling anyone, Harry and Sally are passionate, romantic, they need love, not friendship, and the absence of sex plays as a paradox as it plants the seeds of a relationship that would ultimately need it. The significance of the film before the pivotal sex scene is to play as a 'Man and Women' cinematic 'How To'. It works as a more approachable version of Woody Allen's films, like a 'Annie Hall' marketed for a wider and less sophisticated audience, allowing it to identify with Harry and Sally, so, as I pointed it out, in my 'Annie Hall''s review, the most intellectually challenging stuff they discuss is the ending of 'Casablanca'.But the movie still works because the two leads are so adorable and funny together with the highlight of the film set in an ordinary Deli's restaurant. Many would criticize the unrealism of Sally's fake orgasm scene, but the timing of the scene, and the facial expressions of Crystal with the 'I'll have what she's having' as the icing on the cake perfectly work. The problem of the film is elsewhere, after a while, we know they're made for each other, we're ahead of them, just like their respective friends played by Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher, so we wait for sex to point its nose and then see how it will change the face of their relationship. And this is where the movie lost me. When I saw Sally's beatific smile contrasting with Harry's devastated eyes, I was disappointed because I expected a moment of ecstatic realization.I couldn't believe Harry would brutally leave Sally, more lovely and loving than she ever was, pretending thereafter that it was a mistake. I didn't buy it especially because I rooted for Harry and identified with his existential interrogations. The whole film was punctuated with delightful scenes where older people were telling the way they met, whether it was coincidences or loves at first sights, highlighting a romantic view that would foreshadow Harry and Sally's destiny. For me, having sex together should have been the counterargument not the confirmation of Harry's immature theory. This contradiction left me believing that Harry acted that way just because is was scripted so, and I couldn't get the reason of the mistake until I saw the 'Making Of'.Basically, the film was about Reiner's experience as a single man, translated by Nora's script, and her personal ideas about women and men. Whatever Harry and Sally said was what Rob and Nora believed in. This worked on an 'Allenian' level when they were friends but when they got over the sex barrier, the director and the writer should have left the characters speak for them instead of keeping on studying all the possibilities before Harry would finally declare his love, this was a needless 'suspense'. What follows, till the climax, works like a 'Rom-Com for Dummies' that only works because the actors play their part perfectly? So Harry finally realize that he can't live without Sally, he needed the separation to understand that he should keep this gem of a girl for him, before it's too late.Yes, sometimes, it takes one separation to understand the value of what or whom we're losing, and I'm speaking for my own experience. But the way it was done looked too prefabricated for me, when the realization should have realistically come from the sex scene, or never  but then there would have been no film",8,1,1,10 November 2011
Steve Jobs," An insightful character study but maybe too talkative and ambitious for its own good...
","Half a decade has passed since Steve Jobs' passing but he's as ubiquitous and significant in our lives than ever: we all have personal computers, we watch 3D animation, we have a stock of 500 songs fitting in our pockets, and we're all used to digital technology whether on tablets or cell-phones. In other words, we all owe to Steve Jobs, and this is why he's regarded as one of the most defining pioneers and modern-day inventors of the last century, in the same vein than Edison, Ford or Disney.(Granted Bill Gates was more successful, but he's always referred to as the richest man in the planet while Steve Jobs' star shines a little higher) Yet we're perfectly aware that the job wasn't done alone. But like all the best entrepreneurs, Jobs knew how to combine the talents of people who were lacking one thing, but the most crucial one: a vision. Jobs knew how to guide his teams toward one vision. And being a visionary genius is a double-edged sword and is liable to make you overlook the merits of your team workers, and earn you only respect by way of love or admiration.Jobs' public image was of a revolutionary and inspirational pioneer but in private, lovability wasn't his strong suit and this is what Danny Boyle's biographical film, based on Walter Isaacson's book, is about. As if he took for granted our knowledge of Steve Jobs' accomplishments, Boyle went for a disrupting, but oddly fascinating character study, structured into three acts, each one featuring the launch of one of Jobs' key products : the first mass-produced computer Apple MacIntosh in 1984, the NeXT computer in 1988, designed for a more business-oriented target and the iMac G3 in 1998, which was adapting the computer industry with the Internet era.Although the film features a few flashbacks, like the legendary garage starts, or Jobs' firing after the MacIntosh' failure, it really respects the three-act structure, each act ending before the presentations (so much for Aaron Sorkin's expected speeches). Still, why these three products, why the last two anyway? The film features Jobs in the most awkward and risky positions and it focuses on his failures maybe a little more than his successes, which, put with his private problems, doesn't leave much to appreciate in the man. But we follow the film, we try to grasp at least 75% of the dialogs, confident that such a well-acting cast can't lead us to a flop, and eventually, the film rewards our patience with an overwhelming finale.Still, it was a risky move from Danny Boyle, even more, because one of the last screenplays written by Aaron Sorkin was the Oscar-winning 'Social Network', and Mark Zuckerberg was a student in his 20's who revolutionized social media and became a billionaire in less than a decade. The appeal of such figures is the inspirational stuff great biopics are made of. The same goes for 'Steve Jobs' but it's handled differently by Boyle, as the film is more about the man's darker side, and how it made him the man he was. It actually echoes 'The Social Network' tag-line, showing you can't reach millions of people's lives without making a few enemies, but still, in its own way, the film gets a little depressing at times. Jobs don't have enemies, but it says something when you're not liked by the people who care the most about you, and, when most of the time, you act like a cocky bastard.The trick is in Michael Fassbender's (Oscar-nominated) performance, he doesn't make Jobs likable, but makes us understand that this likability wasn't exactly the best driver to his success, it's a defense mechanism that actually betrays more vulnerability than strength. The trick is also to have his conscience incarnated by his faithful marketing executive and confidant, Joanna Hoffman, played by Kate Winslet, who never hesitates to openly disapprove his decisions and actions, and you can see in Winslet's nuanced performance (Oscar-nominated as well) the exhaustion of a no-nonsense woman who decided that her life would be dedicated to that arrogant prick because somewhat, that made sense. Steve Wozniak (Seth Rogen), co-founder of Apple and John Sculley (Jeff Daniels), former CEO meet Jobs at these launches and vainly lure him into admitting his flaws and faults.Still, Jobs' stubbornness is a fortress that takes almost two decades to be overcome.The three-act structure is perfect in the way it allows the characters to evolve through a natural process, called maturation. It also allows some interesting dialogs moments that erupt from the whole computer jargon, like Jobs telling Wozniak that he might not have his engineering talent, but he's like the conductor of a symphony and Wozniak's a musician. Why doesn't he admit the merits of Apple II in his speech? Steve Jobs is turned to the future and can't afford any sentimentality. This sentimentality is conveyed by the core of the film, the issue over his daughter Lisa, to whom Jobs denies the paternity. This is the key to understand Jobs and his rude behavior, as his background didn't make him pleased by himself either, and the films' ending echoes 'The Social Network' by a little wink to the beginning, when he bonded with little Lisa over the MacPaint.And this is Jobs' story, a series of endings calling for new beginnings, a man who might have jeopardized his career because he didn't care for honors but maybe found unconscious reasons to improve himself, as if the quest for perfection had to call for some self-destruction. And it's like Boyle was inhabited by Jobs' spirit as he also take too many chances with that three-act format, and the result was a talkative character study that would've been perfect for a play, maybe 'Steve Jobs' was a little too ambitious for its own good.",7,0,0,28 February 2016
Crazy Heart," The 'Bad' and the Beautiful...
","'Crazy Heart' made me realize how full of narrative clichés the 'music' genre is. Here we have the run-down alcoholic singer, the struggling mother, the romantic subplot, the musical performance that turns sour, the rehab sequence and so on and so forth. 'Crazy Heart' has all of these... and yet it never falls in the caricature, it features situations we're familiar with but thanks to Scott Cooper's low-key and non-sensational directing, to the nuanced Oscar-nominated performances from Jeff Bridges and Maggie Gyllenhall, 'Crazy Heart' goes on smoothly and fluidly like a sweet Country ballad, without any false note.Low-key is the word, the film and Bridges' acting never insist on making the faded star Bad Blake an object of pathos, only his situation is, which isn't the same. This is a man entering his sixties, he's twice past his prime: country music appeals to blue-collar folks of his generation while his momentum is compromised by the rise of 'hip' stars like Tommy Sweet (Collin Farrell) whose fans never heard of Blake. He understands he's a relic from the past and not à la Hank Williams. And so he spends his time making tours from one small town to another, in places where he can't even put the whisky on his tab, the days of glory are over and the present ones are spent in the company of bottles of whisky in shabby motels. His routine is eventually broken by phone calls from his manager, sending him to another contract in another town in the middle of nowhere.Now, describing this routine isn't just to fill paragraphs, the film's plot (if we can call it so) doesn't break the routine but is diluted in, just like Blake isn't a pathetic guy but a good person and a talented artist bogged down in a pathetic routine. And the film does work like a routine, preparing us for something 'big' that never happens, it's slow-paced but so confident over its material that it doesn't try to go for the easy way, which would be convenient since Blake is a fictional character. His first concert for instance, is a disaster, he spends most of his time taking breaks and go puke in a trash-bin -I liked the touch where his glasses fall inside and got spilled over- but we never get any aftermath of that concert: no argument with his manager, no cancelled concert, no one giving him a bad press, all we see is an old groupie sharing his bed (not exactly a bimbo, she was the nasty pageant official in 'Little Miss Sunshine'). We get it, his contracts are so punctual that the incidents have no consequences, a reason why he's probably drowning his sorrow in alcohol.Maybe Blake's waiting unconsciously for the incident with the gravest consequence, maybe this is a man in need for help who doesn't want to admit it. We suspect something might happen when he meets Jean, a wannabe journalist who comes interviewing him; the interview allows us to learn a little more about the man less from the answers but the way he delivers them. Blake doesn't want to talk about his real name, neither about his son but he keeps his smile on and even asks Jean private questions. Any lesser film would have made an expositional excuse out of the interview, in fact it's a very tender scene, never pressed too hard, where we can see some mutual attraction between the two. Both have made mistakes in their lives, both wish to trust the future and both see in each other a light of hope they were desperately waiting for, the chemistry is inevitable. The romance, like pretty much the rest of the film, is made of quiet and genuinely sweet moments until the one episode that will make Blake realize his life was going downhill.I'm not spoiling here since there's a good deal of incidents throughout the film, a life pattern that can't be a matter of bad luck. Is Blake suicidal? It's more complex than that, the man has troubles but his troubles inspire him. And that's something I've noticed with country music and even country-related movies, music is the storyteller, country music expresses the struggle of small-town blue-collar men, maybe like the soul music of white people, taking its roots in the old folks' repertoire. Blake's music is basically his sordid life translated into poetry, the more he suffers, the better he sings, and the opposite is true. But there's too much suffering a man can take and even if he's got a lot of fans, people who like him, and forgive him, through Jean, Blake realizes his need to be loved again and forgiven. In a poignant scene, he tries to call his lost son and makes amends but doesn't get nothing from him. Blake's friend (Robert Duvall) points out that he made the right step, and at least he can forgive himself.And I'm glad the film never went to spectacular emotional stunts. Watching the deleted scenes in the DVD, I was shocked by one where Bad ended up thrown in the mud and have a breakdown, shouting his real name, this is the kind of scenes the film didn't need and I'm glad it was removed, Bridges is the kind of actor who doesn't need such artifices to win an Oscar. His well-meaning average-Joe aura is enough to make Blake the object of a fascinating character study, as a man going through a double rehabilitation, one against his addiction and another to earn self-respect, to forgive himself before those he love forgive him.This is a sober but meaningful music drama and maybe the reason why country films works despite so many familiar situations Is because the contemplation of life, not rebellion, is the essence of country music, a genre about simple people with complex problems, but that know how to tell their stories with simplicity and sensibility.",8,0,0,15 September 2019
Mudbound," 'Mud' happens... but it can also create the most unexpected and inspiring bonds...
","Racism, war, violence, female solidarity  however relevant these subjects are, they seem rather exhausted on a cinematic level especially when the Awards season starts.Indeed, on the simple basis of its trailer, one would believe that 'Mudbound' is simply Netflix making its 'Color Purple', 'Mississippi Burning' or '12 Years a Slave'. Maybe. But there is something fresh and original in Dee Rees' adaptation of Hillary Jordan's novel and it's a considerable achievement that owes a lot to the writing, the directing and the unusual structure and patient pace of the film. Sure it is a companion to all the movies I mentioned but it has a sort of haunting quality, something that sticks to your mind and dwarfs a rather good film like 'The Help'.What is 'Mudbound' about? That's not an easy question to answer, a few negative critics pointed out the film's lack of focus because it's a multi-character story and there's no lead or supporting roles at first stance, just as they criticized the overuse of voice-over. I didn't mind the voice-over much, the story is so complex and multi-layered that I'd rather have a voice-over explaining things and make it my 'privilege' to pay or not pay attention to it. The lack of focus now is just a matter of half-empty or half-full glass. But here's a way to present the film in simpler terms. 'Mudbound' is about two families, the McAllans (white) and the Jacksons (black) living in two neighboring farms in the Mississippi of the 40's.Laura (Carey Mulligan) married Henry McAllan (Jason Clarke), less moved by love than a desire to escape from her 'old maid' condition, and marital life made her feel relevant and important. Henry isn't the romantic type but no bad man either, and I was glad the movie didn't take one path I expected. No, it's not about that kind of abuse. The McAllans are a steady couple and the Jacksons form a united clan whose patriarch Hap (Rob Morgan) is the descendant of former slaves who worked on that same land, Hap's dreams is to own it in the future although he's not fooled by the worth of any act of property in that racist state. The Jacksons might strike as too 'virtuous' and taking very solemn poses but once you get drawn by the atmosphere and the hostility they constantly face, you realize that 'disunion' couldn't be an option. Hap and his wife Florence (Oscar- worthy Mary J. Blige) can't afford the luxury of not being at least 'happy together'.But the film doesn't venture yet in these unsafe territories; the tone is only set with the presence of Henry's father: Pappy McAllan, a bigoted racist played by Jonathan Banks and whom we suspect will act like a ticking bomb. Henry buys a farm and Laura follows him, circumstances of life will force Florence to work for the McAllans, but as long as these two families mind their own business, so to speak, nothing seem ready to create conflicts. Except for what sets up the second act of the film, the second World War. The merit of 'Mudbound' is to paint notable differences at first until you realize that the two families have a lot more in common. This 'common denominator' is the core of 'Mudbound': the bond between the two veterans of each family: Henry's brother Jamie (Garrett Hedlund) and Ronsel Jackson (Jason Mitchell). Here are two men who've seen hell in Europe, the things we expect and that are not overplayed, but they also lived the exhilaration of liberating countries and discovering a fraternity that transcends racial barriers.'Mudbound' breaks a taboo seldom explored by the movies: the hypocritical treatment of Black soldiers. America takes pride for having liberated Europe but not to the point of questioning the internal 'prisons', and this is the concealed wound the film tries to heal. Ronsel is the most complex of all the characters because he embraced his country's idealism and couldn't believe he wouldn't be rewarded for it. Jamie suffers from PTSD and finds in Ronsel the only man capable to understand him, 'Mudbound' began like the stories of two women, Laura and Florence who were growing to understand each other, a sort of 'Color Purple' of the 2010's, directed by a woman and with enough narrative to play like a feminist hymn, but no, this is a movie about two men, Ronsel and Jamie who grow to respect each other because they found in the mud of the battle-fight the universally human bond. You know what that movie truly reminded me of? 'The Defiant Ones'.The image that immediately comes to mind from that Stanley Kramer's masterpiece of 1958 is Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier as two ex-convicts chained together and escaping from the police. They hate each other, they still carry some bits of racism but the first display of solidarity happens when they're stuck in a deep pool of mud and must climb their way to the ground. Mud isn't just about dirt or about ground but can be a powerful metaphor of something uniting two men, a metaphor for an even dirtier stuff, when 'natural enemies' discover they're equally worthless when put in the same 'mud'... unless they try to overcome it. 'Mudbound' carries this image but it's less about 'mud' than it is about a color-blind 'bound'. The mud is either literal in the film or represented by the trauma of war and also the suffering of women, while not the focus, 'Mudbound' has a saying on that subject as well.'Mudbound' is a proof that Netflix is becoming a major contender in the years to come, I don't know whether the film will meet with Oscar recognition but there should be some love to the haunting cinematography, the screenplay and Mary J. Blige should be a lock if Octavia Spencer and Viola Davis won for what I believe are lesser movies.",9,55,71,20 November 2017
Hercules," Semi-good Disney about Semi-God Hercules...
","After 19 years, I have finally watched 'Hercules'. Why such a long wait? Well, let's just say in 1997, and I had other priorities in mind. See, I was 7 when 'The Little Mermaid' was made and 12 when 'The Lion King' came to the screens, I guess this put me in the demographic category that most benefited from Disney Renaissance. We didn't call it Renaissance back then but I remember each new Disney was an event by itself, and 'The Lion King' was the culmination. Then came 'Pocahontas' and at 13, I didn't think she was worth my attention; Disney princesses weren't my cup of tea anymore. At 14, I didn't care about Quasimodo's romance with Esmeralda either. Still, 'Hercules' should have tickled my curiosity. He was obviously a character in the same vein than Aladdin: young, cool and funky and the film felt laid-back and catching but I had more personal and bitter reasons to snub the semi-God.Number one, I studied Latin in class and naturally, Greek and Roman mythology were parts of the learning. Number two, Hercules was one of my favorite characters ever since I saw 'The Twelve Tasks of Asterix' and I knew all of the tasks by heart, and once I got deeper on the subject thanks to Latin, I thought the journey of Hercules was the perfect material for a spoof comic. And I draw a story of Hercules in January 1997, one that combined the caricature with the real myth, I called him Hercules, but his father was Jupiter, not Zeus, the Disney film uses the Greek names, except for the hero, of course Heracles is less cool-sounding. So, I made the story and believe it or not, one of the gags involved Hercules becoming a super star and passing by a dozens of girls screaming and getting hysterical at him (a take on the then current boys band's phenomenon).And a few weeks later, I bump into an ad announcing the next Disney movie, and I see the exact picture. Seems like the God of inspiration tricked us, or made great minds think alike or maybe that it's just an unfortunate coincidence. Still, after that, I couldn't show my comic story without hearing a comment implying that I got the inspiration from Walt Disney. My hype was gone and I was angry at the film. No matter how promising and fun it was, I always felt it as the one that stole my idea. It took me years to finally watch it and now that it's done, I guess I can 'forgive' it, that the film didn't do as well as the other Disney movies prove that maybe the concept wasn't terrific enough to appeal to the masses, or maybe the film came in that period of uncertainty that transitioned between the Renaissance and Pixar era, the second half of the 90's.Face it, 'Pocahontas' and 'Hunchback' aren't the most talked about film when we reminisce about the nineties, and it's a shame for 'Hercules' that it didn't even make it in the Box Office Top 10 (unlike the others). The film deserved better, it was entertaining, the hero was a cool and gentle guy who tried to blend in a society by being a hero in the 'literal' meaning of the word, his existential quest also cleverly questions what a hero is supposed to represent, is it just a bland name defining the protagonist, the source of merchandising and advertisement, or is there more that he's supposed to find out? The characters aren't undeserving, the sidekick is a satyr and an exciting coach voiced by Danny De Vito, the love interest Meg is perhaps the sexiest Disney female character, and James Woods plays a good villain, as a blue looking Hades. If his blue flame-like hair have a tendency to turn into real reddish ones when he's angry, he's as cool as ice when he handles the situation with Zeus, Meg and Hercules, well, he's James Woods.The movie plays it cool and low-key and I guess this is what allows the film to emerge as a nice little oddity with cult-like appeal, it's obviously meant to be one of these feel-good Disney films and not a heavy loaded drama with Shakespearian undertones à la 'Lion King', the songs are upbeat, the Greek chorus chanting the hero like the Gospel gives the film a certain edge and overall, it's enjoyable, fun and entertaining in the same spirit than most Dreamworks' movies. So maybe the best compliment to Hercules is that it was ahead of its time. Even 1997 with 'Titanic' and 'Men in Black' was quite a tough year to compete in.",7,0,2,14 October 2016
All Quiet on the Western Front," Youth has gone to the ends of the earth to die in the silence of the truth ...
","'All Quiet on the Western Front' is Lewis Milestone's epic adaptation of Erich Maria Remarque's best-selling novel, the name of the author might sound unfamiliar so let's only say that he was a German World War I veteran.The film was made 12 years after the end of the most barbaric and devastating massacres that prefaced Contemporary History with bloody letters and won the Academy Award for Best Picture and Best Directing. I could use so many superlatives to describe it but watching Milestone's war/epic left me cold with all the self- glorification and enthusiasm that only serves as a desire to hide the awareness of our own mediocrity. I will only say that 'All Quiet on the Western Front' is a masterpiece because it's the first movie to make a political statement, and a courageous one, not pacifist but humanistic. If only for that, Milestone's film is a milestone on the field of cinematic intelligence.'This story is neither an accusation nor a confession, and least of all an adventure, for death is not an adventure to those who stand face to face with it. It will try simply to tell of a generation of men who, even though they may have escaped shells, were destroyed by the war.'If not an accusation, it does admit that a generation was destroyed. If not a confession, the film demonstrates that it takes war to realize life's value just as it takes jail to value freedom. And if not an adventure, it still conveys the strange exhilarating feeling of an escape from the world's lies and politicians' vanity, to reach a point where people can become fully themselves, as said Louis-Ferdinand Celine, a French WWI veteran and author: 'Our youth has gone to the ends of the earth to die in the silence of the truth' in 'Journey to the End of the Night'.More than an accusation, confession or adventure, the story is a tribute to a lost generation, the year of the release is even more significant because those who survived the War were not only alive, but young enough to have kept intact memories. 'All Quiet on the Western Front' is a tribute to a youth sacrificed by greed, profit and patriotic glory in the altar of trenches, where every mile cost thousands of bodies. The film starts with boys whose eyes harangued by the patriotic speech of their school professor, burn with the intensely proud flame to fight in the name of Germany and desire of victory... and eventually to leave school. The first bombing will shatter all these beliefs, as they'll understand that whether you fight for French Motherland of German Fatherland, Mother Earth is the ultimate destination.Most of the actors were not professional except for the extraordinary performance of Louis Wolheim as Kat, a mentor for the boys and for us. The actors were as inexperienced and youthful, as the boys who were listed and criticizing the acting on that level is like stamping on an ant when you can admire its strength: the cast embodies the tragedy of a War that dug a big hole in a whole generation. The last shot of the boys walking and turning their faces at us, juxtaposed with the sight of a mortuary, is like a warning for the years to come. But history taught us war is indeed a fever that just strikes everybody, nobody wants it until it happens and everybody wants it until they make it.It's only at war that the soldiers can question its meaning, its origin, and only at war that the ranks, medals and protocols make no difference whatsoever. The most zealous drill sergeant starts sobbing at the first shell wheezing, highlighting one of war's few consolations: to reveal the true value of people in life and make everyone equal in death. In a powerful scene, Paul, the central character stabs for the first time a French soldier, and as he spends some time hidden with the body, he talks to him and realizes that they're both comrades, brothers, victims of the same political vanity and full of the same desire to live. All that separates them is a uniform, and to Death, even uniforms don't make a damn difference. The merit of 'All Quiet on the Western Front' is to be told from German perspective, from the enemy, the other, and what better lesson for empathy than inviting an audience to comprehend that the other side, like in 'Das Boot' for WWII, shared the same trauma? And Milestone's film renders the most horrific aspects of war without any other special effects than an extraordinary editing and directing. 68 years before 'Saving Private Ryan''s iconic opening, Milestone showed soldiers hit by a volley of machine-gun fire, falling but with such a fast-paced directing that we never see them hitting the ground. Some shot show shadowy soldiers jumping from below as to suggest a human submersion, the atrocities and pointlessness of War never seemed so raw and real as in 'All Quiet on the Western Front', because it showed what a slaughter World War I was, whether Spielberg's point was only to show that the second one was a good war.When the few survivors came back to their hometown, they realize that the attitude and the enthusiasm toward the war were unchanged. Civilians and military, Family, the teacher, the boys in the classroom didn't learn anything. 'And our bodies are earth, and our thoughts are clay, and we sleep and eat with death!' says Paul but he only receives insults and incomprehension. But he knows, and we know from his experience that he's the one who owns the truth, because in his mind are all his friends dead in the trenches, in the battlefield, in a lousy hospital. But the tragedy of life is that as usual, it's not the dead but the living that need to be awakened.",10,6,6,3 April 2012
Love Actually," Love is not like that ... and certainly not 'like that' ...
","Remember what Diana Ross said: 'Can't hurry love, you just have to wait  Love don't come easy, it's a game of give and take'Well, according to 'Love Actually', love can come easily and quickly, count five weeks till December 25th... and you'll get it.I remember the first viewing was with my best friend precisely at the end of December 2010, we wanted to watch a gangster film but, after filling our stomachs with some cans of beers, we decided to loosen up a bit and give a chance to the most improbably enjoyable film: a Brit Rom Com  and after more cans of beers, we were ecstatic. For me, it was the most feel-good and warmest romantic comedy my heart ever experienced, I almost wanted to hug my buddy and open my heart to him. The feeling lasted.I saw it again, two weeks ago. I was left perplexed. I didn't even want to finish it. The magic disappeared. And I was almost ashamed of my initial reaction. Guess what was the only parameter that changed between the two viewings (besides being sober)? This time I was married. And this time I saw the film with my newlywed wife, and what my heart 'experienced' the first time, was 'endured' the second. In one year, I believe I learned one thing or two about love, and more than anything, about commitment. I know 'Love Actually' is meant to be a kaleidoscope of all the love-induced situations that ever graced the silver screen for pure dramatization's sake, but this leads to underdeveloped stories canalized by a succession of painful clichés. 'I love you' might be one of the simplest and most touching words ever said in a lifetime, it's also the most intimate and I'm not sure everyone would make a declaration of love in a crowded place.And I can go on and on with all the situations that rang false in my book. Mourning a wife's death is a devastating experience that can't be swept off just because Junior is in love with the most popular girl in school, no matter how creepily smart he sounds. Being betrayed by his wife and brother is the kind of humiliations that would severely knock out any grown-up man, and I'm not sure all it took for Colin Firth's character was a non-English speaking Portuguese housekeeper. I'm not sure it takes a girl taking off her clothes in slow motion to create a love at first sight, when lust would be the most appropriate reaction.Love is not just like that, and love is not 'just like that' (snapping fingers). And 'Love Actually' consists on a successions of wannabe witty romances that would have made Woody Allen roll over his grave, if he was dead. Oh yeah, and the whole thing is packaged in a dazzling celebration of post-9/11 post-modernistic political correctness which is a real insult to reality. A young man is in love with his best friend's wife, and we should just 'oooow' about this because Keira Knightley is just so irresistible. The betrayed friend happens to be black like many other secondary characters that embodies the so cinematically convenient idea of differences that 'make no difference'. I never care about racial minorities' depictions in films, but since the film was obviously desperate to prove its open-mindedness, then why not featuring Indians, Pakistani, Arabs or Muslim characters for that matter? Oh yes, of course, they don't celebrate Christmas.The racial thing is just the tip of the iceberg, that -in fact- betrays an extreme shallowness in the script.One of the Prime Minster's assistant is black, and can easily be regarded as beautiful or ugly, following the tastes. At one point, she referred to the PM's secretary as fat, when she was just voluptuous and quite frankly had more sex appeal than her. But we're supposed to see Natalie as the ugly duckling while she's really attractive. Natalie is ugly by cinematic standards, just like her foul-mouthed language proves that she comes from the 'worst part of London'. Enough to make her unlikely romance with the PM (Hugh Grant, ladies) happen  Well, this was one of the most blatant cases of useless manipulation since the romance between a head of state and a secretary was already good material.I can't believe I missed these details the first time. But at least, it makes sense considering the way the stories are handled, some end happily, some very happily, and 'foursome' lucky dorks, the Christmas miracle happened.'Love Actually' betrays more what it tries to be, than what it actually is. Not any movie can have the wit of 'Four Weddings and a Funeral' and the warmth of 'Annie Hall' so the film can only exploit the magic of Christmas and a penetrating music to beg us to feel good for archetypes, you know those formulaic 'You'll laugh! You'll cry!' slogans.And they're all here, the workaholic architect, the lonely writer, the office's slut, the wife (Emma Thomson) who endures the infidelity of her husband (Alan Rickman) with dignity, the climactic race to the airport for a simple declaration of love, all the multiple story lines tying up at the end in the most artificial ways (did the stories all need to be connected?). The movie tries to satisfy everyone, with interracial love, kids' crush, international love, class loves, infidelity followed by divorce, infidelity followed by reconciliation.Yet, the film is so politically correct that it didn't even have the guts to ruin the 'Family' feeling by having a gay couple in the storyline, so we have a Rock star who prefers to spend Christmas with his manager, two body doubles pretending to have sex is one thing, but is a gay couple for Christmas asking too much?",6,8,13,17 April 2012
12 Years a Slave," The perfect response to 'Django Unchained' ...
","If there ever was one movie that Hollywood owed big time to the Black Community, it is certainly Steve McQueen's '12 Years a Slave'.Warning ahead, this is not-another-film-about-racism, this is not a fashionably white-guilt-inducing drama, this is not 'The Help', 'The Butler' or 'The Color Purple', '12 Years a Slave' is of a league of its own. The movie explores familiar grounds until suddenly bare-handedly digging into the crass that soiled American memory, extracting from it, an experience like so few cinematic experiences. Again, it does look familiar. What we see, we know but it's precisely about knowing what we see: a bold, accurate and gut-wrenching depiction of slavery as a holocaust.Yes, holocaust. The term seemed to belong exclusively for World War II and till now, whenever uttered, it's Nazi uniforms, swastikas, concentration camps and striped pajamas that come to minds, night and fog, rather than sunshine and cotton fields, German shepherds and rifles rather than trees and ropes  but if there is one certitude that no one should ever deny, not anymore, it is that slavery started through the denial of black people's humanity, a misconception that lasted for centuries, a length unparalleled by no other atrocity whatsoever. Population mass slaughters, slavery, transatlantic trades, all started with the general consensus that black people were born for servitude, the holocaust was moral in the first place.My exhilaration while watching '12 Years a Slave' was governed by an awkward mix of revulsion and satisfaction, each frame was unnerving but in the same time, I was thinking, 'God, that's what eyes must see', minds know what it is, but eyes have to be affected, have to be inflicted the spectacle of slavery and its intimate rape on innocent souls. Looking in close-up at the effects whipping can have on a poor woman's back, at the blood splattering at each whip, the noise hardly covered by the shrill screams, that instead of a sentimental close-up on a teary eye. The film is still full of tears and close-ups but they never distract from the cruelty reached by slave owners in some particularly upsetting scene.Of course, the comparison with 'Schindler's List' is inevitable. Even I, did start the review by mentioning the word 'holocaust', because I believe the film has a profound cathartic effect for a community, allowed to be acknowledged the extents of the brutality they were victim of, something that hasn't been covered that much by film-making. 'Can we get over racism and slavery, it's been 150 years?' complain some, well, Cinema didn't tackle it enough  can you imagine that a film like 'Django Unchained' was praised for being one of the first mainstream movies to deal with slavery? This is how Cinema desperately needed a film to make the point 'Django' didn't make or made badly for the sake of a cheap and pornographic depiction of violence..Just look at the performance of Di Caprio in 'Django' he's a suave and distinguished villain à la 'Bill the Butcher' but can anyone who finds him despicable ever put words on Michael Fassbender's portrayal of Master Epps? Fassbender in '12 Years a Slave' oozed the kind of vileness I never found on movies since Amon Goeth in 'Schindler's List'. But while the Nazis believed Jews were disposable human beings, who could die any time slavers thought they had a biblical right on their slaves, they cherished the idea of owning them, on the plantation field, and Epss' fascination with Patsy (Lupita Nyong'o) the most cotton-picker of the plantation, the sensual attraction he feels toward her reveals something much deeper and no less disturbing in the inner psychology lying underneath the surface of slavery: possession.And the attachment to the notion of possession became the slaves' real chain: they could be beaten, whipped, but not killed, unless they died from exhaustion or lynched. And it is so telling how envied those who die are. Blacks weren't regarded as humans, not even animals, almost like objects, and that makes the whole reality even more difficult to accept. And the documentary-like realism of McQueen's masterpiece was the perfect response to Tarantino's fantasy western-spaghetti. Not to deny Tarantino's right, he used the same plots for a 'Jews vs. Nazis' story in 'Ingloruious Basterds' but how many holocaust dramas were already made to fulfill their educational purpose. 'Django' had to come after '12 Years a Slave', only 1 year before is a thin consolation.I wish I could expose more in this review, than the parallel with World War II holocaust, but this is my genuine reaction. I just read that Steve McQueen felt like reading Anne Frank's diary from Solomon Northup's novel retracing his 12 years of detention as a slave. I wouldn't blame him either for making a film that would play like a 'Black' 'Schindler's List', especially since the film doesn't suffer from Spielberg's usual flaws. '12 Years a Slave' is not sentimental, not Manichean, not cartoonish. As a matter of fact, Whites are not all despicable, for one whip-happy Paul Dano, you have Benedict Cumberbatch as a comprehensive and benevolent master, for one scary Sarah Paulson as Epps' sister, you have Pitt as a Canadian progressive.Never patronizing, never compromising, the film is all about the fight and struggle of Solomon Northup, magnificently portrayed by Chiwetel Ejiofor, a man profoundly humanist, not as a philosopher, but simple as a man who sees humanity in every color and race, and can't therefore believe what he's going through, a man anachronistically modern, we can all identify with, and this is why his experience is so harrowing, so moving, so penetrating.Spike Lee said you can't make a western-spaghetti out of slavery because it was a holocaust, at least, the film proves his point right. Steve McQueen did it, finally, screaming what 'The Help' and even the opening scene of 'The Butler' (which I look at now with more perplexed eyes) whispered.",10,6,13,17 January 2014
There Will Be Blood," The most flamboyant portrayal of materialism and its alienating effect ...
","It's about expansion, it's about capitalism, and whatever that caused the demise of the Wild West myth. 'There Will be Blood' looks, smell, feels like a Western but this is an Anti-Western more than anything  There's so much to say about this movie but it left me speechless at the end, Daniel Day-Lewis was hypnotic, giving a performance that reminded me of Orson Welles in 'Citizen Kane', and Humphrey Bogart in 'The Treasure of the Sierra Madre' ... He's definitely one of the greatest actors of his generation, especially in this performance that probably best defines the alienating effect of materialism. The 40's had Charles Foster Kane, the 80's had Gordon Gekko and the 2000's have Daniel Planview.Indeed, 'There Will be Blood' is not your typical 'soul corrupted by money and/or power' drama, as I said, it's all about materialism, ending with a pocket filled by gold and a heart made of the same stone you've been working on all your life, it's trusting anything that has a specific color, a specific smell, working on a land to find a greasy black liquid gushing from its womb, and never, never trusting or giving any credit to 'nothingness' or 'abstraction'.Daniel Plainview considers these abstractions with the most profound disdain. Nothing is free, nothing comes from nothing, nothing is unsubstantial. If one claims to be your brother, he has to prove it, if one should make a deal with you, he should talk business and not about education ... not because it's personal, not because it has nothing to do with business, BUT because it is NOTHING and nothingness irritates Plainview as if the only thing he could believe on had to be material. The rest is nothing, feelings are nothing, believing is nothing, these so strong and noble words for us, well, Plainview doesn't give a damn about them...And more than anything, above all these abstractions, there is religion, God is Daniel Plainview's archenemy  this is the ultimate masquerade for him, the cancer that gangrenes the progress, an evil that transforms people into sheep, almost like animals, the biggest hypocrisy of all  Plainview, the capitalist, almost shares the same opinion than Marx who thought religion was people's opium. And because Plainview despises this hypocrisy, he tries to exorcise his hatred by using religion to achieve his plans, exploiting it, like he exploited his adopted son. No feelings, no sentiments, everything should serve a palpable purpose. The end justifies the means.And ultimately, he gets rich at the end, he's a respected and feared tycoon, as the purest and most implacable illustration of the American dream. But is he happy? no! because power, prosperity, those are still empty words ... he believes in material, in things, in stuff he drinks like the iconic 'milk-shake' metaphor that still resonates in my mind as one of the most memorable hymns to greed and pragmatism. Plainview is greedy, but not evil, evil is still too abstract a word; because it implies the use of one own conscience while Plainview's conscience was dedicated to one goal: getting bigger, possession, expansion, territoriality.And are we to blame him? Let's not forget the bleak cinematography at the beginning of the film where we could feel, the stink of the oil, the hardness of the rocks and the land as an incontrollable enemy ... let's not forget that Plainview spent half of his life stuck alone into dark holes made of land, stone, metal, oil, and raw matter, so close he could almost feel them, so close it became a part of him ...'There Will Be Blood' is the quintessential film about materialism and its alienating power, when all that matters is matter!",10,4,6,22 March 2011
Joker," Joaquin's no joke as the Joker...
","Todd Philips' 'Joker' has spread so many comments and controversy that I don't know exactly where to stand. The film reminded critics of Martin Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver' and while Joaquin Phoenix' performance channeled the inner angst and alienation that drove the driver Bickle to an extreme -and bloody- corner, I found so many other sources of inspiration that if anything, 'Joker' is the best tribute to the New Hollywood period.I found 'Network' in the film, 'Death Wish', references to 'The King of Comedy', Marty's underrated movie about a man who wished to exist through the only talent he felt being endowed with... and naturally, there's something of 'A Clockwork Orange' in the obscene stylishness the Joker embraces his new persona with. In a way, that the film met with controversy is logical, you can't make a social comment about violence and its dangerous appeal by sugarcoating it, violence like its enemies, use symbols and slogan, in fact, revolt is a mask that violence uses to operate undercover or is it the opposite? 'Joker' is the slap today's audiences needed and that it used the Joker mask in our superhero era makes it even more relevant and accessible. But truth be said, any controversy the film should stir mustn't distract from the real deal.Indeed, any viewer familiar with one tenth of Phoenix' filmography knows the actor's ability to portray enigmatic and troubled characters with a dark side barely hidden, but even with that in mind it's impossible not to be blown away by his performance and compelled by his suffering. He shouldn't be the dark horse of the awards season but the frontrunner because his performance is so rich, so powerful, so intense and so bizarre and grotesque in a captivating way that it's almost like watching a movie within a movie, as if his distortable face was the operation theatre to his acting force, as if his nervous smile slowly turning into cries made a true symphony of pathos and anger. That actor is a treasure to Hollywood and here he's given the kind of rangy performances that can't do without earning awards. His snubbing would be controversy material if you asked me.Now, to the film. The first act immerses us in the life of Arthur Fleck, a clown and wannabe stand-up comedian. At first, I was afraid that the manic laughter scenes would be too redundant and turn themselves to cheap gimmicks, to remind us that we're dealing with the Joker, but no, Phoenix plays his Arthur as a man who's not a bad person. Raised by an over-protective and sickly mother, brutalized by kids who sees in a clown a living sign saying 'kick me', humiliated by people who can't understand his medical condition, the point isn't to portray Joker as a martyr but a product of a specific environment and education, or lack thereof. Like anyone, he's got dreams, projects, but he's entrapped in a condition that makes it impossible to communicate or connect with the others except through hallucinations and would-happen moments, he's a misfit with a fragile condition that keeps worsening until it offers a platform for his dark psyche to perform.Does the film excuse him? No. Does it justify his actions? Hell, no. It just clarifies the need to perform that way. There's a point of no return reached in that psychological journey, when one humiliation too many triggers a strong desire to express itself through a sort of showmanship, something relevant in our days where people seek any ways to reach posterity. Set in what seems to be the early 80s, it puts Arthur in the same urban alienation context than Travis Bickle but with a passion shared with Rupert Pumpkin's and a 'mad-as-hell' prophetic rage with Howard Beale's role. Near the end, there's a shot that follows one of the film's most shocking moment and it's an obvious nod to the anticlimactic finale of Lumet's masterpiece.But I can't insist too much on how good Phoenix his, one could see a few impersonations of Malcolm McDowell's dance when he 'punished' his fellow droogs or get vibes from the two only performances that earned a posthumous Oscar, Peter Finch and Heath Ledger, still, there's something unique in that tormented role he inhabits with such a soul dedication that it makes Nicholon's Joker worse than the cartoon counterpart. ,'Joker' isn't dangerous but brave enough to question violence in the way it seems like the only plausible answer, it might titillate a few demagogue instincts but that's an unfair trial in the light of the recent events all over the world and that preceded the film. I walk often at night and see homeless people living in impoverished conditions, drowning their sorrows in alcohol and losing their manners once there's nothing to lose... and perhaps that's leaders' responsibility, praising democratic values while its application contradicts its own ideal. Anything is allowed when nothing is possible, is perhaps the biggest joke of all, and that it goes all downhill when the social budget is cut is perhaps the film's boldest stance against the shift between leaders and people.And that it used Bruce's father Thomas Wayne to connect the final act with a canon we're all familiar with is one of the many narrative delights of that character study and psychological thriller Ã  la 'Woman Under the Influence' where suspense doesn't come from a bomb but a ticking bomb of a soul. If De Niro's presence ties the plot with its chief inspirations, the film belongs to Joaquin Phoenix who gave a performance for ages, and a character who's relevant in the way he pits democratic ideals against urban reality. And my wish is to see another connection with De Niro with Phoenix winning an Oscar, it would be the second time for a character who already won one after De Niro with 'The Godfather Part II'.As for the glorifying violence trial... we've been there already.",9,6,11,14 October 2019
To Kill a Mockingbird," My Father, This Hero...
","I wasn't yet the movie fan I am today but the first time I saw the American Film Institute's Top 100 heroes and villains, I could recognize almost every name, I expected a few exceptions but certainly not the number one hero: Atticus Finch, played by Gregory Peck, in the adaptation of Harper Lee's Pulitzer-winning 'To Kill a Mockingbird'. Seriously, who was that dork who had the nerve to be worthier of the first spot than Indiana Jones or James Bond and that I wasn't even familiar with?And 'To Kill a Mockingbird' kept popping up in every AFI list and even on IMDb Top 250, so it was an emergency case in my watch-list of fresh new movie fan. So, I saw the film and could see what was so heroic about this noble-hearted white knight of the South, who dared to question racism at a time where it was common banality. And he was played by the noblest of all actors: Gregory Peck. I often criticized his acting as wooden but perhaps this is the one instance where it did fit the character and his Oscar wasn't stolen although O'Toole as Lawrence of Arabia, Lemmon in 'Days of Wine and Roses' and Lancaster as 'Birdman of Alcatraz' had more complex personalities to play with.But there was something crowd-pleasing in the story of Atticus Finch, something that exceeded the expectations of cinema and satisfied the Hollywood conscience, it was still a time of relative innocence where the problem of racism could only be displayed through a white people centered story. Not that it's a bad thing but I wish the film had kept its original tone, as a story seen from the perspective of a growing precocious tomboy named Scout (Mary Badham), whose perception of her lawyer of a father and of the world of adults is influenced by one of the cases he must handle. 'To Kill a Mockingbird' is a childhood story, inspired from Lee's memories of the tired Southern town of Maycomb, but the film carries a child-like innocence that doesn't fit the case.Scout is a girl spending time jumping, climbing hills and trees with her brother Jem and their friend Dill, inspired by her childhood friend Truman Capote, and she sees her widowed father as a super-figure who has an answer for every question. And it seems that the film has somewhat embraced this creed and made Atticus Finch the hero of this picture, which is puzzling because he's not the focus for the whole first act. But we're supposed to embrace his nobility and optimism because it is obvious the case he must defend is a sham, and it doesn't even take courage but common sense. It's not much Atticus who's noble but the other people who are downright bigots and hateful. It's an insult to intelligence that Robinson is declared guilty despite Finch' invitation for humanism and empathy, but the real heroism would have been to convert them. Finch's aura is one of a preacher, powerful, symbolic but eventually, useless.I actually enjoyed the film and it's never as good as when it plunges you in the children universe and their interpretation of spooky local stories. Scout is like a little sponge trying to understand and appreciate the world as it comes to her eyes, learning from her father,the meaning of words like 'empathy', and the subplot also involves the identity of Boo Radley, which highlights one of these aspects of childhood when you tend to believe the adults, until you realize that they're somewhat corrupted and unworthy of trust. But when Atticus learns the news about the death of Robinson, I couldn't believe he believed he tried to escape. That the film doesn't even exploit the event and makes it look as it really happened that way, that the Black people would just be passive observers with no capability for action and when the town drunk, evil Ewell, spits on Finch' face, he doesn't flinch, I thought the whole sanctification of Finch was overplayed. A preacher, he might be, but a saint, he wasn't. Maybe in the eyes of her daughter, but at that point, the film was told from the adult perspective, not only it didn't work, but it didn't even match the character.Finch was genuinely furious during his trial statement, he expected to save his client but he was shot dead in what seems to be obvious lynching, instead of prosecuting the case and serving the cause to the fullest, he accepts the outcome and when he's confronted to Ewell, he takes the spit like Jesus would take a slap. Robsinson was dead at that time, was Finch so perfect that he couldn't even give the guy the punch he deserved, what was to lose anyway? Couldn't one of the black guys do it? No, it had to be the hand of God through the providential Boo Radley (a youngish Robert Duvall) to punish the bad guy as to mystify the whole thing again, and creates some deep symbolism between a sordid case of rape and the local village idiot. An unpunished crime to avenge the first, too much religious symbolism for what should have been a tale from a child's eye.In the movie 'Capote', when commenting about the success of the book, Capote says 'I don't know what the fuss is all about'. Speaking for myself, I can understand why the film is such a celebrated classic, but it doesn't hold up very well in today's context while the masterpiece from Capote 'In Cold Blood' says as much as human nature and vileness as the book and is still relevant today. 'To Kill a Mockingbird' is a classic, no doubt about that, but not all classics are supposed to be perfect. Maybe I will find in the book these missing elements of 'perfections' though I trust Capote's opinion on it.",7,3,4,30 May 2017
The Bridge on the River Kwai," 'Greatness!' 'Greatness!' ...
","I believe the purpose of a good war movie is less to preach or invite to take sides, than to depict war through the devastating effects it operates on sane conscious minds, by making or avoiding it. It's not a hazard that the best movies depicted war as a complex state of mind, exhilarating then alienating.David Lean's extraordinary merit is to make a film of a war won by the Allies, with no victory at the end, except of cinematic intelligence. Like 'Apocalypse Now', 'All Quite on the Western Front' or 'Das Boot', the best war movies deal more generally with defeats, 'Saving Private Ryan' being a relevant counter-example. 'The Bridge on the River Kwai' depicts another vision of victory through Colonel Nicholson, the perfect embodiment of the manic attachment to principles.Colonel Nicholson, (Alec Guinness) leads the troop of British prisoners to the camp of Colonel Saito, (Sessue Hawakaya). The soldiers' entrance, whistling the 'Colonel Bogey March' tune is one of the film's most defining moments but interestingly misleading since this is their only 'shining' moment. The rest of the film, we see them idly building the bridge, then more seriously under Nicholson's commandment. We also see them having fun the last night before they leave. This is not supposed to portray the real conditions of Japanese PoW camps, but cinematically, the soldiers are Colonel Nicholson's foil. He's the story's heart, through his psychological conflict with Colonel Saito.War always reveals dualities, not dual disorders like in psychological thrillers but two visions incarnated by antagonistic characters: Willard vs. Kurtz in 'Apocalypse Now', Barnes vs. Elias in 'Platoon' and here, Nicholson vs. Saito. Quite a practical conflict, it concerns Saito's decision to make the officers build the bridge for the railway that would link between Bangkok and Saigon. This bridge is Saito's mission, his honor and his life depend on it. As an adept of Bushido, Saito wouldn't let failure humiliate him. The officers shall build the bridge because it's their dishonor, which brought the soldiers to the POW camp. But while Nicholson accepts the defeat and the soldiers' obligation to build the bridge, he refuses to participate to the effort invoking Geneva's conventions. Saito whips Nicholson with the book, starting the psychological battle that would lead to one of the most iconic cinematic climaxes.Nicholson is so attached to his principles he would rather die in the 'Oven', the 'punishment' box standing to the sun not to obey to Saito's personal vision. This is the point, Nicholson, a man of principles, surrendered because it was a military order. But his respectable posture progressively flirts with insanity when it puts his men's lives at stakes. In a particularly memorable scene after Major Clipton, the doctor, meets Nicholson in the oven, the colonel's stubbornness makes him wonder, under a hellish sun, which of Saito or Nicholson is madder  and unconsciously, where this madness will lead to.To a personal victory for Nicholson, first. Saito, realizing the incompetence of his engineers, accepts Nicholson's conditions and handles this defeat by crying, privately. This is a personal defeat and his childish reaction illustrates how some military decisions, right or wrong, can be driven by personal issues. Saito's defeat is personal; Nicholson's victory is of the British Army, of 'civilization'. And the way Nicholson handles the construction of the bridge illustrates an integrity almost too zealous for his men and for Major Clipton. For Nicholson, it's a matter of keeping his men in shape, and proving the value of his Army for the posterity. Nicholson's project became personal, and his inflexibility automatically pointless.This rigidity is mocked by another major character of the film, no pun intended, Shears (William Holden) though I must admit, I wasn't too confident with his wisecracking cynicism in the first act, I preferred the wiser 'Shears' during the mission with the Major Warden, blowing up the titular bridge. Shears who pretended to be an officer, is blackmailed in order to accomplish this mission, he's technically a hero for having escaped Saito's PoW but his status of a fraud isn't the best ticket for the Navy Cross. He must come back to the camp; we understand that his odds to survive again will be pretty low.But I didn't see that ending coming. I said iconic climax, I should have said ironic. More than a war movie, it's all about personal views, and how two opposite sides can co-work to create something. Saito and Nicholson built the bridge with an involvement so personal their complicity is almost romantic in the setting sun scene, where each one contemplates his accomplishment, Saito, who renounced to his dreams for the Army, Nicholson who dedicated his life for it. Ironically, their last collaboration would be to prevent the bridge from exploding.And in one of the most suspenseful climactic sequences ever, Nicholson, moved by a paternal instinct, tries to save the bridge, causing the death of the allied soldiers. And while the train of Japanese VIP is coming, Nicholson realizes how blinded by his own pride he was in a last flash of realization incarnated by the unforgettable line 'What have I done!' His last heroic deed would be to die and fall on the detonator, destroying the bridge, the train, and the last ounces of remaining sanity, provoking the immediate reaction of Clipton : 'Madness! Madness!' These last lines perfectly summarize the absurdity of war driven by alienation. The chaotic ending is like an implacable victory of fate which decided that each side is equally alienated in this waste. The whole film from the script to its superb climax that made the film for me, is quite cynical in its approach, and that's why I can forgive the music for the ending credits, where I had expected a big silence, like a 'No comment' reaction to an unbelievable madness But as Major Warden (Jack Hawkins) said: 'There's always the unexpected, isn't there?'",10,0,2,13 May 2011
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Existence is defiance ... Thinking is subversion ... 'One Flew' is inspiration ...
","Looking at the gray screen, R.P. Mc Murphy comments an imaginary baseball game with such enthusiasm the images seem to come alive. All the inmates of the Mental Institution are laughing, cheering and shouting, while the head administrative Nurse, Mildred Ratched, asks for silence. But for one brief instant, they're free, and this freedom, as illusory as it is, has never been so palpable, it was freedom to challenge the authority, to transcend the limits of a blanked out TV set this short but powerful moment perfectly illustrates the philosophy of Milos Forman's masterpiece 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'. One of the all-time greatest films and most inspiring invitations to rebel against the tyranny of establishment.In fact, the greatness of the film exceeds the context of the story, but I think what makes it so impacting is the presence of a clear antagonism through the interactions between two polar opposite sides of human nature : order and rebellion. Order is represented by one of the most iconic and despicable cinematic villains ever: Nurse Ratched, perfectly portrayed by Louise Fletcher. A woman, whose soft voice, cold eyes, and passive aggressive attitude is the incarnation of the cold tyranny of rules, as sterile and unproductive as they are. Doesn't this ring a bell? You know, where every thing must go the way it has always been, for no other reason than that the opposite reality would be dangerous. What deviates, what is different disturbs and must be brought back to the road, or eliminated. Fascism? Not so far. Anyway, this tyranny does have a castrating effect on the inmates, all males. And the liberation will come from the protagonist, R.P. Mc Murphy, Jack Nicholson at the peak of his career, playing his most inspiring and unforgettable role. McMurphy as the character who best defines Nicholson.McMurphy, with his inseparable beanie, malicious eyes, pornographic cards and foul-mouthed (body) language, is not just the hero of the film, he's also a tragic icon of New Hollywood, a wave that provided one of the greatest films of history. Almost a Christ-figure, this is a man who will sacrifice many opportunities to be free, in order to free other inmates from an unfair perception. From the dictatorship of a society that treats them as outcasts, as people who deserve to be domesticated, to repress their nature, if they want to become or to be considered as normal. This is the ultimate freedom, the one of the spirit, almost Nietschian: to accept yourself instead of trying to be accepted by society, and screw society if she labels you as crazy. It's your freedom of thought and any form of thought is subversive. This defiance is taught by McMurphy as soon as he enters the lives of this world made of weird faces, funny attitudes, and unpredictable reactions, after discovering the masquerade. They are this way, because they're asked to follow some rules whose only purpose is to give a pseudo meaning to their lives, because life is supposed to be guided, to be punctuated with rituals and cycles, it's the lobotomizing effect of routine: medication time, music, exercises, the so-called therapy where they have to share their problems, highlighting the true sadistic behavior of the Nurse. They don't even realize how alienated they are, and how this monotony will never solve anything but just keep them away from the rest of the world, maintaining a normality in microcosm.McMurphy breaks this routine, making Nurse Ratched his enemy. His free-spiritedness grows on the inmates who start talking, raising their hands, challenging the power: the ultimate rebellious attitude. And another strength of the film is the ambiguity of McMurphy's character who might as well be perceived as a rebel who just want to make a mess, while Ratched is the one who tries to maintain some order. Those who label Ratched as fascist will probably face the pro-Ratched who'll consider McMurphy as an anarchist. But this is an intellectual debate while the movie deserves to be taken on a more emotional level to understand how Ratched is the true villain of the film. Her irresponsible sadistic behavior will provoke one of the saddest cinematic death, not because she deliberately wanted to kill but she was so coldly heartless, she didn't find another way to assess her power. She obviously regretted the act when it was too late, but she pushed the level of respect and obedience to the extreme, twisting the concept of order into dictatorship.'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' is not about who's crazy or who's not, after all, before the fishing scene, didn't the inmates ironically look like doctors, especially the famous Dr. Scanlon? It's about resurrection of repressed personalities, through playing poker, basket-ball, fishing, drinking, having fun, becoming ourselves, by refusing to be passive and to be the actors of our own lives. The film is driven by a wonderful supporting cast, probably the most memorable non big-star supporting cast where each character is authentic in his own way, Cheswick, Sefelt, Scanlon, Harding and the tender, fragile and suicidal, Billy Bibbit  and of course, the Chief, who like us, is the witness of this dramedy. The Chief, whose growing friendship with McMurphy will lead to one of the most heartbreaking and noblest gestures, the most inspiring movie ending, sublimated by the scream of Christopher Lloyd as Taber.A sad ending foreseen by McMurphy in this unforgettable long close-up during the party scene, McMurphy probably figuring that this will end badly, that there's something so rotten in this world, it's better to enjoy the present without caring about tomorrow, the meaning of this close-up remains a mystery, even if the next scene brings some answer. But men like McMurphy are indispensable to prevent order from becoming an alienating force. And instead of being lobotomized by the obsessional psychological tyranny of being normal, anyone should be able to flee over his own cuckoo's nest.",10,2,3,6 March 2011
Downfall," The fall of evil ... to put the reasons of its rise into historical perspective ...
","She gives her children sleeping syrup then she puts cyanide pills in their mouths before closing them, one by one, causing an immediate death. One of the most sickening deaths my eyes ever witnessed, and the woman who commits this cold-blooded murder is Magda Goebells, the wife of Adolf Hitler's infamous Propaganda Minister. When Hitler, Nazism, the Third Reich, the dream of Germania were over and the Russians coming, not only she refused to be part of this new 'Nazi-less' order (she and her husband would kill themselves right after) but she decided to prevent her own children from living this reality.This only scene sums up the cruelty and degree of evil alienation Nazism exercised on civilized minds, it's like the rise and fall of evil, seen in microcosm.'The Downfall' deals with the last days of Nazism trapped in a devastated Berlin, incarnating a Germany ripped in its flesh. The setting is Hitler's bunker, whose claustrophobic feeling gets more perceptible as the end is approaching. In the case of Hitler, so alienated by his own fanaticism, his contempt for weakness caused him to suicide, after having 'suicided' his own people. I think the parallel with the Magda Goebells' scene is quite obvious. Hitler literally put Nazism in the mind of his people before condemning them to a certain death. Therefore, I can't see how this movie could be blamed for sympathy towards Nazis. What were people expecting? This is a historical movie, with the same coldness and detachment the course of events expresses towards our human judgment. The movie is about what happened, had it inserted any ounce of our post-war judgment; this would have been an epic, anything, but not this masterpiece of German realism in the same vein than the great 'Das Boot'.Now, let's get this straight. Is the movie guilty of portraying Hitler in a sympathetic way? The answer is yes, and no. Yes, the movie did portray the 'Most Hated Man of Modern History' in a sympathetic way, and no, the movie is not guilty of that. On the contrary, it's its greatest achievement, and success in the field of cinematic intelligence. Had it tried to portray the monster in a monstrous way, this would have been falling into the kind of traps that makes consensus almost synonym of dishonesty. 'Downfall' reached the same level of intelligence as 'Das Boot', while providing the same thrills through the claustrophobic feeling, and inviting us to question our personal approach to the notion of evil.Bruno Ganz delivers one of the most powerfully intense performances I've ever seen, inspiring both hatred and pity, as Adolf Hitler. It's the kind of performance that should have earned him every cinematic Award nomination but of course, considering the character, this would have been quite difficult. Another proof of the subjects's uneasiness, as if it was more convenient to portray the evil with one-dimensional levels of cruelty or simply to ridicule him, garnering pitiful laughs, in other words, better to please a fallacious consensus than to respect the audience's intelligence. That's why 'Inglourious Basterds' is more popular than 'Downfall', I guess people are more comfortable with that.And if you think about it, the same reasoning that created the controversy carries something of the same visions that can lead to fanaticism. Fanaticism starts with general consensus, right or wrong, and this consensus is built on the automatic condemnation of the 'no'. Said differently, extreme positions lead to extreme situations, and the film finally broke the last taboo, in a cathartic way that transcended the big screen.To understand is to analyze with objectivity. And objectivity, self-criticism, allow to avoid the same mistakes. Have we learned lessons from history, has WWII 'vaccinated' us against fanaticism, as destructive, if not more? No. Because people still read history from a 'winner vs. loser' point of view. And this ridiculous categorization lead to perceive what was only military duty with the glasses of heroism or evil. That's why movies like 'Downfall' are necessary. It depicted Nazis in a sympathetic way, but not Nazism, which is the main point. Nazism was totally embodied by fanatics, on the top of them, Hitler, and the main officers, but the rest were soldiers, fighting for beliefs they were brainwashed in, for years and years, without any opposition.The movie redeems a whole misconception that have proved to do more bad than good, because of comforting the idea that evil is like a kind of virus that can be fought only by eradication. Nazism was the embodiment of an evil fanaticism, but to get rid of it is to kill it from the roots, the same roots that made Nazis point out the Jews as responsible of Germany's defeat, and we all know, how it ended up. The film tactfully evokes the Concentration camps at two moments, specifically one crucial scene where Hitler's evilness is more explicit. Similar moments occur where he spits on his own people considering they deserve to die in defeat, moved by his eternal contempt of weakness, inspired by the same rules that govern animals' lives. If one perceives this portrayal as sympathetic, well, it's hopeless.Yes, in other scenes, he's shown as a delicate, charming, sober human being, but well, I guess one must be quite 'charming' if he managed to lead one of the most civilized people to the hell of barbarity. Besides, let's not forget this is a movie told from the point of view of his secretary, a young idealistic woman who saw Hitler as many German people did.But the movie doesn't show Hitler this way to plead in favor of the population. As said Traudl Hunge, youth wasn't an excuse. And despite all the efforts, it seems like the guilt carried by German people is not over yet",10,1,3,15 May 2011
Whiplash," Ba dumb bumb cheshhh!
","'Whiplash' tells the story of Andrew Neiman (Miles Teller), a young drummer whose obsession is to become 'one of the greatest' and who finds his match in Terence Fletcher, a conductor who put the 'mentor' in 'monster' and 'monster' 'in maestro' and will push Andrew to heights of unsuspected greatness and to the edge. For lack of a sequel, we'll never know if Andrew became the best drummer of his generation, but there's one thing we do know: Damien Chazelle is Oscar-nominated for 'La La Land'. If he wins (and he certainly will), he'll be the youngest Oscar-winning director of Hollywood history. And there's more: 'La La Land' earned 14 Oscar nominations tying the record of 'Titanic' and 'All About Eve', and it is very likely that the film will tie the all-time records of Oscar wins, if not break them. And Chazelle isn't even thirty, he doesn't even look thirty. Only two years have passed between his directorial debut and the kind of wet dream for a vet director, let alone a 'squeaker'. So I'm not sure if I want to review 'Whiplash', a fascinating coming-to-greatness story, or the story behind 'Whisplash' which embodies the same nervously inspirational spirit. Actually, it is not a hazard that Chazelle made his bones through a movie about talent, ambition and discipline as he applied these vital life parameters to himself. How do I know that he's got talent? Is it subjective? I don't know. But there's an interesting moment that says all... when Fletcher visits Andrew's school band, looking for someone to pick.I'll pass over the mockeries and derogatory comments to the untalented players, so you have Andrew as the second drummer and not even appreciated, Fletcher lets the first drummer play, then Andrew. They play like one second each, yet these seconds are enough for Fletcher to detect the real potential. It seems that Andrew's got the little sparkle just enough to be considered a page-turner in Fletcher's conservatory, but it will be a long road till he earns his part or not. Now, has Chazelle talent? Well, judging by whatever was displayed in this film in terms of acting, directing, writing, editing, and even sound mixing, I would say, hell yeah! The 'squeaker' earned his part as one of the most promising directors of his generation.And 'Whiplash' is a long road to greatness paved by the harrowing mind-wrestling between the fierce mentor and his ambitious disciple, and one of the most captivating love-and-hate relationships of recent years. And as painful or cringe worthy as it gets, we feel that harassment is the kind of 'end-justifying-the-means' technique to go beyond expectations. Fletcher does have a point, and it's true that there's no good coming from casual complimenting. I myself remember a teacher who used to harass us in prep school, she could let me fill the blackboard for four uninterrupted hours and always commented the work we did by 'could have been better' or 'pathetic'. One day, I managed to elicit a jaw-dropping 'very good' and it was an extraordinary feeling. I wish sometimes I had someone harming me for the sake of my accomplishments.But now, I'm projecting my own experience in 'Whiplash', while the film goes deeper in the enigmatic personality of Terence Fletcher. He believes in Andrew's talent but he doesn't like him for all that. Fletcher is an antagonist and the paradox is that his antagonism improves Andrew's talent more than anything. JK Simmons, who owned the Supporting Actor category during the awards season, is an instant icon in this film, and the way he loudly asks Andrew if he's dragging or rushing was so intense I felt like he was shouting at me. Fletcher shows us the key to self-accomplishment: not rushing and not dragging, seizing the right timing, the right tempo to get to action and secondly, an indirect lesson: no one owes anything and the least you expect from others, the more you expect from you.Andrew isn't perfect either, there's a moment where he breaks up with his new girlfriend, killing the relationship before it even started. He didn't want her to undermine his path as if he was convinced already he was going to be the greatest, embodying Muhammad Ali's classic 'I was the greatest before I knew I was'. But as admirable as his self-confidence is, the journey of Andrew doesn't go without a few 'accidents', some more deserved than others, and I wouldn't dare to spoil the third act which elevated the film from a fine Indie music to a fantastic duel of egos with drums and music and venomous rancor as weapons.'Whiplash' is one duel after one, between rival drummers, Andrew and Fletcher, and ultimately Andrew and himself. He doesn't belong to a musical family, he has dreams, that alienated him from family and friends, but he knows if he was good enough to catch the ear of Fletcher, that might say a thing or two about his talent. Granted Fletcher isn't the nicest guy but nice guys aren't all talented or successful. So it all comes down to 'Whiplash''s third act; a satisfying jazz crescendo culminating with a super finale where everything is beating, your feet are tapping and for one moment you do believe that jazz is the finest musical expression of all time after classical music.And maybe beyond ambition, talent and discipline, the reason why this awkward college boy-looking director made such a sensational impact, is because he knew about jazz, it was his passion. So maybe passion is the key. And he was so passionate that in order to get the money, he simply made a shorter version and submitted the film to Sundance, and the rest is history. Like a sort of 'Rocky' with drums and its extraordinary ending, 'Whiplash' is (simply said) the embodiment of its own success story.Ba dumb bumb cheshhh!",10,1,4,12 February 2017
The Wolf of Wall Street," 'Goodfellas' in 'Wall Street': Wolves in Armani's Clothing...
","'Why don't you boys go down to Wall Street and find some real crooks?'This is Tuddy Cicero speaking to the FBI men while they arrest his brother Paulie near the end of 'Goodfellas'. It's very revealing when 'ordinary' gangsters believe they don't hold a candle to the Wall Street guys. And after the 2008 financial crisis, the Goldman Sachs and Madoff scandals, it's hard to prove them wrong. 23 years later, Martin Scorsese, the greatest gangster movie director, finally did justice to Cicero's words and took on the 'bigger players', through his adaptation of Jordan Belfort's autobiographical book.Jordan Belfort is a guy who, as far back as he could remember, always dreamed of making money and found an easier way than being a gangster: he became a trader. He wasn't more handsome or charismatic than Henry Hill (as portrayed in the films), he just studied and got the passport to Wall Street. He could do what Hill did in all legality proving Al Capone's quote that 'Capitalism is the legitimate racket of the ruling class'. In fact, he almost made the Goodfellas look closer to Robin Hood figures, at least, they bribed a few working-class men.'Goodfellas' was craftsmanship compared to what these 'wolves' in Armani's clothing did: elevating theft to an industrial level, about making millions in a few hours, and money out of virtually nothing, which is the essence of finance. It reminded me of these courses in business schools teaching how to make risk-less money through arbitrage. What Belfort makes is more straightforward, he sells worthless action to blue-collar people and then, it's the traditional supply-and-demand rules, the more people buy, the more others want to buy, the value increases and when it goes high enough, you sell. What then happens to your client is besides your concerns.Call it unethical, cynical or criminal, but this is the world's holistic system. And the only talent that can make you rich quicker than talented and deserving people is being a good salesman. Because, when you have to sell ****, just sell dreams. A good trader sells securities and buys capital, he sells promising values and makes real money, and it takes some communicative skills to make that possible. And that's the key to these characters' 'likability', by cinematic standards; they know how to communicate their appeal, that's the 'Gekko' syndrome.The screenplay, written by Terence Winter, is full of these pep-talk speeches echoing the famous 'Greed is good' tirade and we have such motivational ones as 'there's no nobility in poverty' (also borrowed from Oliver Stone's film). 'Wall Street' set the tone for the financial-themed movies, and there's a reason these films fascinate us: we all love money, we all dream of being rich, if we dream of something else, it's liable to have wealth in the process. There's no potential dream that doesn't involve in a way or another, sex, money or power, these movies speak to us, in a very personal level.I often found myself thinking that an average guy must make money to have sex with a beautiful girl, and a beautiful girl can get a rich guy easier than an average one. The film made me understand why: basically, a man's main currency is the money he makes, even if you don't dream of banging hot girls, you won't earn your nagging wife's respect if your pockets are empty, and a woman's currency is her beauty, her body and her willingness to use them. Not only Margot Robbie's frontal nudity is not shocking, but it's also a necessity. When you have these guys indecently throwing lobsters, wiping their ass with paper bills or harassing flight attendants, it's just their money language, they can get away with it. Full nudity is the woman showing her best asset in that decadent world, it's a fair trade.And only Scorsese could have portrayed such loathsome and amoral characters with that flamboyant, dizzying and electrifying style. The characters are sleazy, have nicknames as pathetic as their intentions, as if behind every trader, there was a crook sleeping, but they strangely appeal to us. There Scorsese's obligatory morally corrupt protagonist rising high to fall hard, a multiple-time sinner who's given a few moments of redemption but won't go until the sun really burns his wings. Leonardo Di Caprio finally brings a performance where he can show a wide range of emotions, be charismatic and pathetic within the same five minutes and the credits also go to the gripping realism of the portrayal of cocaine, crack and Quaalude uses.No movie ever portrayed drugs and lust, and the combination of both in such a straight-forward way, and that was essential because there's got to be a catch behind such a dreamy lifestyle. This ambivalence goes further as the title was borrowed from an unflattering portrait of the young yuppie go-getter, yet it gave him the perfect publicity to build his reputation. Did things change much? After he cooperated with the FBI, he served a few years in prison and became a motivational speaker. In the film's closing scene, you can see people looking at him with respect and adoration. The joke is on us.From Leo to the surprisingly good Jonah Hill as his right-hand man Donnie Azoff, from Matthew McConaughey as his first tutor, Kyle Chandler as the FBI agent or Jean Dujardin as the suave and crooked Swiss banker, the film is some actors' finest hours, and that includes Rob Reiner as Leo's father and the promising Margot Robbie. 'The Wolf of Wall Street' is Scorsese back to his roots and one of his best.And what a cruel injustice that Roger Ebert, Scorsese' number one fan, who loved every single film he made with Leo and adored 'Goodfellas', didn't live up to see the culmination of the actor/director's duo and the film in the same vein of greatness than its glorious predecessor.",10,5,10,19 March 2016
Die Hard with a Vengeance," With a Vengeance ... and Minor Flaws ...
","The 'Die Hard' series is governed by a simple but infallible pattern, John McClane, no matter which situation where the average Joe would have 0,0001% chances to come back in one piece, he's put in, he will survive. Indeed, John McClane is so inhabited by his innate heroic status dictating the fact that he's always the 'Man-of-the-Situation' that the question is never whether he'll get alive or not but how he will. The 'Die Hard' series is all about the 'how', the spectacular reason-to-be of the series that would be so boring if McClane wasn't so fun to watch. That's why no matter how unrealistic some parts are, the movie provides the same level of old-school action-driven fun and enjoyment as another series about a charismatic macho hero named James Bond.Let's develop now the idea behind the 'how'. The 'Die Hard' films' appeal essentially relies on their ability to create surprises. The first one, released by John McTiernan, not only succeeded in that exercise, it became a landmark in the action genre, paving the way for the classic 'average Joe movie heroes vs. elegant sophisticated movie villains' antagonism, this now-dated cliché was 'Die Hard''s innovation. The second film, released two years after by another director: Renny Harlin, was a good continuation of the first: set in Christmas too, with the same plot, and John McClane saving a day  where so much more lives were in danger (and the film is known for having a particularly impressive body count) Now to the third, it was released five years later by John McTiernan again, a predisposition for being better than the second? Maybe  but I still regard the second with higher esteem.'Die Hard, with a Vengeance' delivers what everyone would expect from a 'Die Hard' film, without even recycling the same plots that would have made it another Christmas disaster. This time, the film is set in a hot Indian summer day, in New York City. While the thrills of the first two films were largely conveyed by a feeling of claustrophobia, this time, the most frightening aspect of the enemy is his ubiquity. The movie starts with a spectacular explosion in the middle of Manhattan that sets the tone of the film, it's not a hijacked building or airport, it's the whole town, and more specifically, it's John McClane's territory. For the first time, he's at home. There will be basements and elevators of course, but also tunnels, subways, highways, chasing taxis, derailing trains, surfing trucks in a fast pacing that gives the profound feeling of a journey in hell (a subtle reference to the movie's French title) But these are only minor bits of originality when compared to what makes the third opus really different from the first two. The first and most notable one is revealed in the title, a vengeance, and again, it is less about who gets the revenge than how he does. The villain played by a Jeremy Irons at the top of his game, will play with McClane through many riddles and intellectual games, one of the little things we most remember from the film. And this playful vengeance only serves a much more masterminded plot, which, after all the pieces of the puzzle get assembled constitute one hell of a creative plot. After all, you don't take a whole town with hostage without having invested some time to elaborate the scheme, one that makes Hans Gruber and Colonel Stuart look like amateurs.The second aspect is the partnership with Samuel L. Jackson, as Zeus, a store owner involuntarily mixed in McClane's cat-and-mouse game. Zeus's prejudiced views on racial issues and his dislike for McClane aren't fooling anyone, we all know how this duo that looks like a combination of 'The Last Boy Scout' and 'Lethal Weapon' will end. But Jackson is such a charismatic actor that when he outshines Willis, we're able to detach ourselves from McClane and see him with more partial eyes. And their interactions get even more delightful when they try to solve one riddle involving some water jugs. If only, for these bits of creativity, I sometimes enjoy 'Die Hard With a Vengeance' a bit more, although it does kill off the charm of the series by featuring probably 90% of the most unrealistic impossible-to-survive sequences. McClane might be 'James Bond' superhuman but he's not Superman, don't you remember his bleeding feet in 'Die Hard'? This is the movie's forgivable weakness, despite all its originality, it could have been titled 'Die Hard With a Partner', 'Die Hard in Town', 'Die Hard with a Telephone' or 'Die Hard without Holly', the movie doesn't avoid the blatant action-films clichés that would made it unworthy to have its title beginning with 'Die Hard' and I'm not talking about unrealistic stunts. The villains-monologues, the decision to kill the hero with a bomb or to beat him to death instead of shooting him in the head that makes you wonder why the villains always have to kill poor sentinels or harmless looking guards in a straightforward and quite gruesome way, and give John McClane the benefits of a bare hand fight? There are a few moments like this where 'Die Hard with a Vengeance' is objectively inferior to 'Die Harder', let alone 'Die Hard'. And believe me or not, despite all this, I would still have given the same rating as number two if it wasn't for   a particularly weak final confrontation. I don't mind anticlimactic sequences, but when the most spectacular moment in the movie isn't the last one, it's really disappointing. This time, I wished 'Die Hard with a Vengeance' was a bit more conventional, and I don't think it was too much asking from the fans.",8,0,0,14 November 2011
"Hail, Caesar!"," Oy, Caesar...
","'Hail, Caesar!' was one of the most anticipated movies of 2016 and one of the earliest releases. Being the last Coen brothers' movie made it an event by itself and probably one of the first expected Oscar contenders. Well, are you surprised that it only got a (lousy) Production Design nomination? I am not. Because... let's not kid ourselves; we all know the movie that marked the beginning of 2016 was 'Deadpool'. Sure it is less artsy and subtle than the more gourmet offering of the Coens but the film had the merit to feature a consistent plot, hilarious gags and without trying to be too smart, showcased a level of hip wit and self-deriding fun that 'Heal Seizure!' failed to deliver. And I'm the first to deplore it.I know these two movies are as close one another as Meryl Streep to a Michael Bay's script, but they have one thing in common that justify the comparison, they're meant to be fun and they rely on parody. The parody is the key because it works on a material we're all familiar with but then distorts it in order to produce gags based on unpredictability. The trick is to not to rely too much on the spoofed material because not every audience would get the references or because the film serves the references, not the opposite. I'm more familiar with Hollywood history than comic-books heroes, yet I enjoyed 'Deadpool' more than 'Give'em Hell, Caesar!', I know it has everything a movie lover should love, it is a love letter to Hollywood, not without that ounce of wicked wit the Coen brothers made a specialty of. This is a film I wanted to embrace with my arms wide open, I love the brothers' movies and a film about Hollywood is the kind of offer I couldn't refuse. But this is 2016, we had 'Moulin Rouge!', 'Chicago' and 'The Artist', then 'Argo' and 'Birdman', movies about old-school Hollywood have flourished like cactus in the desert. I even started to reconsider my love for these films because of the way they started a tiresome trend but again, this is a Coens' movie so it's always new even by the standards they create. I saw the film once, I had to see it twice, and then even a third time.Indeed, if it came from any other director, I would have thrown it already in the trashcan of my contempt but the Coens always get the benefit of the doubt. So how does 'Hell or High Caesar!' hold up after the third viewing? Well, maybe better than at the first but that's not saying much. The premise is simply brilliant, having a Hollywood office worker whose specialty is to fix things (he's not called a fixer for nothing), and played by the always convincing Josh Brolin made me feel like I was going to penetrate an atmospheric neo-noir masterpiece like 'The Man Who Wasn't There'. Then the movie cuts to the titular film-within-the-film, a Tale of the Christ where George Clooney, playing a washed-up version of Robert Taylor in 'Quo Vadis', is kidnapped.But by the time we get the identity of the kidnappers, and their political inclinations, the film features a collection of old-school Hollywood pastiches with an Esther-Williams actress played by Scarlett Johannsen in a Ziegfeld Follies act, a Western B-movie actor who's probably a reference to... some B-movie actor and a few other musical numbers. To get things straight, they're all well done, but they don't add anything to the plot except for just being well done, they drag on for so long I suspected they were used as time fillers. Some parts were hilarious though, I loved the scene with Fiennes as a Polish director or where Eddie Mannix talk with the religious representatives and they go into a debate about God. God, that was pure Coen brothers' genius.But despite the obvious effort to cover all the elements that made the history of Hollywood in the 50's, the Hayes codes, stars' depraved lifestyles, the Red Scare, 'Excelsior' might be just a tad too sophisticated for its own good. It is probably an intelligent movie in its stylish complexity but it commits a rather silly move by predicting our instant praise on the simple basis that it's about movies. Well, the stunt seemed to have worked with critics as the film but it didn't show with the audience and many viewers dismissed it as the worst Coen brothers' film. Would I? Well, forgetting the premise and some hilarious parts, it is probably the worst in the sense that it simply used Hollywood as a vehicle for gags, but they never made you feel you that it was going somewhere, 'meh' was my most frequently obtained reaction.I felt some strong Woody Allen vibes from it, from the stellar cast (also including Channing Tatum, Frances McDormand, Jonah Hill or Tilda Swinton as the two gossip columnists, twin sisters embodying the Hedda Hopper/ Louella Parsons rivalry) the film might have worked better had it played like Woody Allen's masterpiece 'Radio Days'. The film could have been a 'Hollywood Days' with many little vignettes and that would have forced the Coens to push the concept a little higher, to make each one as enjoyable and entertaining as the whole of the film. Or maybe they should have just tried to forget about the whole homage thing because the film was never as funny as when it took departure from its Hollywood shtick.Now, to end on a positive note, if you love Hollywood and appreciate a good love letter with all the archetypes that forged Hollywood legend, just watch the magnificent five-minute dream sequence of 'The Ballad of the Daltons'. As for this film, well you might give Caesar what is Caesar's, but there's not much to give.",6,0,3,7 February 2017
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," There was Rhett Butler, Rick Blaine, Rocky Balboa, Raymond Babbit and now: Ron Burgundy...
","Every once in a while, a movie character suddenly pops out and becomes an icon despite the limited chronology of his existence. Maybe not 'Forrest Gump' or 'General Maximus' instant icon but something in the same vein than Otto from 'A Fish Called Wanda' or Spinal Tap. His name is Ron Burgundy, he's San Diego top-local anchorman, he's tall, nicely built, handsome in a funny way, and wear bright-colored suit that so scream 70's... what do you know, this is when the film is set: good old 70's when TV was the king media.And Will Ferrell is the king of all kings, a man at the pinnacle of his career, charm and self-confidence. And he just doesn't throne over San Diego, where he's religiously followed by all San Dieg whatever you call them, but he's also the Captain of his winning league, the team work including sports reporter Champ Kind (David Koechner) whose cowboy hat tactfully hides a face-ruining baldness, and makes him look like one of Biff Tannen's sidekicks. There's also Brian Fentana, the news reporter, played by Paul Rudd, the only mustache to compete with Ron's. And there is Steve Carrel as the intellectually challenged Brick, the weatherman.If Brick is here to provide the obligatory 'non sequitur' lines (and by obligatory, I don't mean they don't work), the two other sidekicks are like Burgundy's clones with something lacking. What exactly? Well, since Burgundy doesn't strike as the brightest bulb in the box, let's say he's the most confident over his talent or maybe he's the best prompter reader (which will cause him a few troubles). So we meet Ron when he's at the top, and since he can't get higher than that, we expect a little intrusion in his dream-team. His boss, played by Fred Willard, decides to add some diversity and hires a new reporter, Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) which, as her name clearly indicates, is a woman. The blasphemy! The tragedy!That the team is baffled by her entrance is a gag by itself, and a source of great ones, although the film is set in the 70's, it's strange to see it populated by guys who still believe men should drag their women by the hair. You think I'm exaggerating? Just watch the scene where Ron is courting the beautiful Veronica and just think whether a caveman wouldn't have come up with a better rhapsody. Still, it works by making Ron grotesquely touching. 'The Legend of Ron Burgundy' is a film that, on the surface, looks very misogynistic and mean-spirited but even the most hardcore feminism can't overlook the fact that the film makes fun of these men's misogyny more than anything, and actually, it is what drives the whole narrative of the film, it's all in the conflict between Veronica and Ron.But the film doesn't go for simplistic and predictable plot devices, the first pleasant surprise is that Burgundy actually puts the Ron in Veronica, they fall in love and she asks him to keep their relationship private. Guess what he does next? He screams it all over the office, and as if it wasn't enough, he shares the secret with his viewers. After all, isn't San Diego's voice of truth entitled to speak the truth? So if Ron says that he loves Veronica and she's got a nice rack, well, within his own wicked and macho sense of humor, it's still true. That's the secret of great comedic characters, they're consistent yet unpredictable, and on that level, Burgundy reminds me of Borat, another great mustached comical character of the 2000's.I also mention Borat because he comes from a mockumentary and you get similar vibes from the film, with all these weird reports on pet contests and other local news items so trivial you wonder why they were taken so seriously. Well, the content might make you laugh, but it is true that these people, as eccentric as they were, existed and they were as passionate and loving their jobs as Burgundy. And Burgundy, through his childish insistence on keeping things under control, is like Tim Burton's 'Ed Wood', the worst director ever, but a great guy who loved his job more than anything, and had fun doing it, and that's the key of Burgundy's likability, and Ferrell's performance.Indeed, when an actor has fun playing a character, it shows on the screen, and you can tell the whole cast had fun, even the guys who played Burgundy's archenemies obviously, those who are below on Nielsen ratings, and perhaps the highest ratios of cameos per minute, one that makes the early 2000's almost as old as the 70's. I must say I cringed a little when the arena fight went over the top, I wasn't sure the film followed the right path, but then it had the perfect punch-line, with the great 'Wow, that escalated quickly', which became a meme to describe a situation going ridiculously out of control. When a so-so scene ends with the most memorable line, it becomes a great scene.And the movie is full of many many others, and many touching ones, too. It was directed by Adam McKay, who just won an Oscar for his dense and entertaining 'Big Short' screenplay, a mix of comedy and drama to explain the financial crisis. In 'Burgundy', retrospectively, you have hints of his promising talent in the way he tackles the reality of journalism world with a comedic tone, for once that the caricature doesn't serve to hide some ugly truth. And when the present is so ugly and scary, news-wise, an outdated weirdo like Ron Burgundy is a pure delight.",8,1,2,8 March 2016
American Gangster," Frank Lucas, the gangster who means business... literally.
","'Every gangster's downfall will be his false sense of invincibility'I found that quote in a Youtube comment from the clip showing Frank Lucas' arrest and that it belongs to notorious mobster Carmine Galante who ended up shot in his favorite restaurant, gives it such an eerily prophetic dimension it can work as a mantra of the gangster genre.They all start with a fascination for the gangster-figure and end with the realization that sooner or later, wings get burned.'Goodfellas', 'Scarface', 'Casino' etc. all follow that arc and even 'The Godfather' if you consider the sequels, providing the perfect canvas for a captivating character studies. And as Lucas, Denzel Washington, intimidating in all calculated smoothness, encapsulates the 'initial reaction', exuding the kind of macho appeal we secretly long for in our boring and compromising lives like Pacino, De Niro or from the old days Cagney and Robinson.It's a timeless story rooted in any decade of America's contemporary history, a gangster makes his bones, expands his territory, earning many friends, a few enemies and the dreamgirl. Gangster films are the antithesis of fairy tales for they have a happy beginning and all build up for the downfall that might come from greed, human mistakes, ambition, betrayal, sometimes even principles... there's always a price to pay. Lucas could keep his fortune and quit drug business while he was at the top, he chose to move on, ego was his downfall but he had understandable motives that show that gangsters storylines aren't schematic for the sake of it.The genre is perhaps the best social commentator to the American dream, the irony that a man had to use capitalistic methods to reign over Harlem and restore order. He might be a killer and a heroin dealer, Lucas is a visionary businessman who learned from the 'best'. While Scorsese's films feature flawed characters, 'American Gangster' is closer to 'The Godfather' in its depiction of a brilliant man who took the wrong direction: a good manager whose 'my man' catchphrase resonates as Brando's offer one can't refuse, so when it's time to get off the cover and pull the trigger, he won't hesitate. One of the most memorable scenes have him kill a rival in broad daylight and it's not much the boldness of the move than the certitude that no one will snitch on him.Ridley Scott's biography of Frank Lucas' life accomplishes something I didn't think was possible, combining many elements of the gangster genre that, taken alone, would've been enough to make a great film. First mention to the organizational aspect: the death of Bumpy Johnson left Harlem chaotic and comforted the Italian mafia couldn't keep control. Lucas understands the necessity of leadership and in all admirable pragmatism, decides to sell a better product at a lower price, and the Vietnam war offers a perfect cover to smuggle heroin directly from the main source. On its own, his success is a marketing school-case enhanced by a memorable moment where he lectures a big customer (Cuba Gooding Jr.) on the value of brand and merchandising.Another value that plays a key role in the film is family. Lucas isn't a womanizer, he believes in family ties, gives jobs to his relatives, buys a house for his mother (Ruby Dee), gets married and shares a Happy Thanksgiving dinner with everyone. But ike in 'The Godfather', family is a double-edged sword as Lucas owes the most of his troubles to screw-ups from his relatives, including his nephew (Chewitel Ejiofor) and to counterbalance these effects, the crowning moment belongs to little Mama Lucas who prevents Frank from killing a corrupt cop (played by Josh Brolin) because even she knew it was personal and her angst toward her son spoke in subtext: 'this has nothing to do with business!' Dee deserved her Oscar nomination for that scene alone.And I guess Washington (who was perfect) was snubbed because we've seen a lot of that before, 'The Departed' was still fresh in memories and other titles keep popping when you watch one scene or another: Lucas asking his nephew to keep a low-profile and not to be too loud fashion-wise channeled De Niro's warning after the Lufthansa heist in 'Goodfellas', Lucas' shooting a man on the forehead being his 'defining' moment echoed the restaurant scene when Michael shoots Sollozo. Still, the most significant parallel is the climax, set in a church where Lucas is sitting with his wife and mother intercut with shots where cops arrest the family members. The baptism was Michael's rise, the mass isn't much Lucas' downfall but the cops' triumph as the film isn't just about criminals but about the law. The film is both 'The Godfather' and 'The French Connection'.Though it occupies one tenth of this review, half the film belongs to the investigation lead by Richie Roberts, Russell Crowe as a cop who ostracized himself after refusing to keep a million dollar found in a car. It's only fair for a gangster reminding of Michael Corleone to have a 'Serpico' against him. And I loved the way the film patiently waited for their two paths to converge at the conclusion and have them talk about a simple concept: 'the right thing'. A brilliant man did horrific things and lead a happy life (though briefly), a man acted straight and lived miserable. Lucas was a criminal but a self-made man, Richie served the law but without any reward whatsoever.Washington and Crowe magnificently embody the contradictions of the American dream, making for a multilayered story of men acting according to their beliefs for right or wrong. It's easy of course to root for Roberts, as for Lucas, I guess all you've got to do is listen carefully to the lyrics of 'Across the 110th Street', the song says everything, speaking from Harlem's heart of darkness, from the 'soul' before passing the torch to rap music at the end of the film... when Lucas was history already.",10,5,7,11 October 2019
The Mission," The greatest movie about the three universal languages of the soul: faith, love and music...
","Goethe said: 'Religious worship cannot do without music. It is one of the foremost means to work upon man with an effect of marvel.' I don't think there is a more eloquent movie moment to illustrate that statement than the scene from Roland Joffé's 'The Mission' where the Guarani Indians find Father Gabriel (Jermeny Irons) in their territory.The previous Jesuit priest who tried to convert them ended up tied in a cross and sent to his death in the vertiginous Iguazu falls, probably the film's most spectacular and defining shot. Father Gabriel traveled to the same falls, to pursue the quest of his ill-fated predecessor. He won the hearts of the Indians through the simple use of an oboe. The Guarani, captivated by the music, couldn't believe that an instrument capable of such a divine sound would bring a bad omen for the tribe. The Guarani didn't speak Spanish, Father Gabriel didn't speak their language yet, but what are words except the language of the mind, and how useless can they be when music, the language of the soul, can be understood with no need for translations. 'The Mission', Golden Palm winner of 1987 relates the epic South-American journey of the Jesuits in the middle of the 18th century. And much more, it's served by one of the most beautiful scores ever written from Ennio Morricone, which conveys the transcendental aspect of music as a universal language, a key for people's souls. It's true that, by depicting the martyrdom of the priests who fought for the indigenous people's right, the film can be perceived as a celebration of religion. But religion comes from 'relegere', which in Latin means 'uniting': uniting people under a same faith, even nobler because it relies on values such as love, equality and justice. It's significant that Father Gabriel doesn't convert only the Indians but also a mercenary and slaver named Mendoza (Robert De Niro) who thought himself beyond any redemption, after having killed his brother in a duel.Mendoza follows Gabriel to the Christian sanctuary, along with Father Fiedling (Liam Neeson). He pulls a heavy bundle containing his armor and sword, what's left from his previous life, and after crossing the falls and getting to the Guarani territory, Mendoza finally measures the accomplishment and finds himself among brothers. He bursts out crying, and his tears strangely mix up with the kind of smile only De Niro could make communicative and poignant in the same time. Mendoza takes vow and becomes a priest, trading his sword to a Bible. If one thing, 'The Mission' is a hymn to universal brotherhood, and only our in our faithless era, one could take it as pro-religion film. How can it be pro-religion, when the same Guarani will end up massacred by the slavers who believed in profit, today's very religion?'The Mission' is set during that specific time where Catholicism became the scapegoat of all the European revolutions, where the same people who justified racism or slavery blamed everything on the Church. The Guarani sanctuary would be left to the Portuguese disposal after a territory transfer and a Papal emissary, Cardinal Altamirano (Ray McAnally) a former Jesuit himself, was sent to examine the situation. Although he's amazed by the success of the Jesuit Mission, he is confronted to a dilemma: if he yields to the Spanish plantation owner Cabezo (Chuck Low), one of Mendoza's collaborators who doesn't even believe that Indians are human beings, there's no doubt that the whole tribe will be enslaved. If not, he'll create one terrible schism within the Catholic Church, as the Jesuits would have dared to interfere with the Portuguese interests , represented by Don Hortar (Ronald Pickup). The choice is obvious and so is its bloody aftermath, no one could have expected anything from Hortar or Cabezo, when the pure voice of a little Indian singing had not effect on them, even inspiring an abject comparison to savant parrots. Mendoza dealt with them, and reconsiders his Jesuit vow when he understands that only the language of weapons can fit the men, whose souls cannot be touched by the divine grace. And whether the fight is already lost doesn't matter, they all obey to a mightier authority than plantation owners or politicians. When Altamirano tries to reason Gabriel so he can reason the Indians, the Guarani leader questions his authority, isn't he representing God, and how can even God be a matter of reasoning. Only God can know where the truth lies, religion is not a democracy but at least everyone's equal under God.Naturally, the marching civilization annihilates the Guarani, just like the Conquest of the West destroyed the Natives, and like many countries, till now, use the content of their civilizations to justify the fight against religious obscurantism in the name of modernity, while maybe religion is still trying to protect some of the best of Human civilization. As the film concludes.' The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.' Faith, like music, speaks for something hidden in the soul that no one can't reach, the belief in people's inner goodness, that no one is beyond any redemption, that's what Catholicism is about, and I'm not even Catholic, but within my own religion, I can respond to a film like 'The Mission', and that's what Ennio Morricone's music accomplishes and what makes it one of the greatest score ever made. It's too magical for words and too divine to belong to one religion.And it's so close to Heavenly perfection that any flaw, right or wrong, which a critic would find, on the editing, the storytelling or the directing, is immediately redeemed. I wouldn't believe a film capable to transport my soul with such a mesmerizing music would have anything to be criticized. I guess my reaction was similar to the Indians when they listened to the sound of Gabriel's oboe",10,9,11,13 November 2012
Stranger Than Fiction," Never underestimate the genuine appeal of reality
","What an imaginative and touching story! Marc Forster's 'Stranger Than Fiction', written by Zach Snyder, is a movie that could have failed in so many aspects despite its creative premise, yet the story confidently moved forward, punctuated by clever, poignant and thought-stirring twists.And Will Ferrell's performance is integral to the film's success because he plays a nuanced and extremely restrained character who contradicts the very comical premise of the film, as soon as we think this is going to be a fantasy-farce. This is even more pleasantly surprising as Ferrell is like the Bill Murray of his generation, a SNL alumni used to madcap comedies where he plays eccentric and one-liners-throwing characters. Here, he is Harold Crick, a meek and discreet IRS agent who lives under a steady routine guided by an electronic wristwatch.The opening voice-over narration insists that nothing special ever happened to Harold Crick... for the simple reason that he's the one controlling his life and saw no reason whatsoever to make this change. He's no Truman Burbank or 'Fight Club' Narrator; he likes the minimalist scope he gave to his life for twelve years (from his Spartan house to his by-the-book ethics). But who said we've got to make our own existential crisis? One day, a voice starts narrating Crick's thought as he's brushing his teeth, there's something literary in the disembodied (female) voice he hears, Cricks stops brushing his teeth, starts again, and then the voice describes his feeling at that point. We get it, it's the story of a character who hears the narrator, and this premise is exciting enough.But there are reasons I mentioned Bill Murray or Jim Carrey in this review, 'Stranger Than Fiction' feels like one of these clever concept movies ('Groundhog Day' or 'The Truman Show') but Ferrell plays the protagonist differently than Bill Murray as Phil Connors, and even Jim Carrey managed to be comical at times like giving a wink to the audience who needed at least one funny grin. Ferrell doesn't surrender to comedy no matter how comedic his situation gets, he plays his character as if something serious, like an illness, was happening. And this is a revelation, a proof that any actor, given the right story and direction, can go beyond the preconceived limits of his acting range. Adam Sandler gave me a similar impression in 'Click' but the film wasn't as consistently good.'Stranger Than Fiction' never takes its originality for granted. The narration is only the starting point, we only hear it during crucial times, and it starts being a problem when the narrator is revealed to be omniscient, and explains that a simple act Crick just committed will lead to his imminent death. It is not the word 'death' that provokes a sudden outburst of angst, but 'imminent', tragedy material. When a voice that knows everything about you or your most hidden thoughts tells you that you're going to die, well, even the most Cartesian and sensible man will be likely to believe it.Crick goes to a psychiatrist played by Linda Hunt, she diagnoses a case of schizophrenia but suggests him to ask a literature professor. Within the twisted premise of the story, this is implacably logical, so Crick goes to Pr. Hilbert, played by Dustin Hoffman. Detached and rational, Hilbert gives him homework. Crick must determine whether he is a comedic or tragic character, one that is governed by the continuity of life or the inevitability of death. Crick must test whether he controls his storyline (or not, like a tragic character) and then tries to do whatever he wants, if his death is so inevitable. At that point, we already forgot about the narrator, and the film gets closer in themes and tone to Spike Jonze and Charlie Kaufman's masterpieces.Indeed, 'Stranger Than Fiction' made me realize why self-referential movies are so fascinating, they have something inherently human behind entertaining plots. And the core of the story is the sweet romance between Crick and a free-spirited tattooed tax-rebel baker played by Maggie Gylenhall. When he starts auditing her, you feel the attraction, but he can't reach her heart because he's stuck up to his job, and it takes time for him to finally allow her to reach him. The chemistry feels real as there's something authentic in their performances, Ana loves what she does, and Harold, governed by the necessity to give a meaning to his seemingly meaningless life, starts doing what he loves: playing guitar, developing friendship, pleasing himself.Ultimately, Ana falls in love with him and Crick thinks he might be in a comedy, until he finally sees the face behind the voice, it's author Karen Eiffel (Emma Thompson) who seems to be the one pulling the strings. The trick is that she always kills off her lead characters, and the trickiest part is that Crick's life is only depending on whether she decides to kill him off or not. She shares her mental block with her editor's employee (Queen Latifah) wondering about the perfect way to kill Crick, until she realizes that he exists. The film escalates to the level of mind-bending genius (a word that has been so overused for the likes of 'Inception') when she gives Crick the manuscript. Hilbert reads it and considers it a masterpiece with his death being part of that greatness. And Crick reads it and agrees.It all comes down to a simple question: should one die just because it makes a terrific ending? This is one of the greatest narrative tricks ever pulled on screen and an existential lesson. Crick gave his meaningless life a meaning (wasn't he laughing at 'The Meaning of Life' in the theater?). Maybe life can be less flashy than its dramatized version, yet as 'disappointing' as the ending was story-wise, it was deeply moving and touching in the way we connected it to our reality and a little bit to fiction.",9,12,13,24 March 2016
The Green Mile," A moving experience whose profound beauty will take you totally... off-guard ...
","Death is not sad by essence for no one can ever experience the sadness of his own death. But death is sad because it takes from us the persons we loved and loved us, those who witnessed our lives or a part of it, those who shared with us the happiest or saddest moments. And death is also the measure of love, as we only realize the value of people when we miss them. And while 'The Green Mile' is set in a prison's death row, but it tackles the subject of death to better highlight the value of love.Love, maybe more than any other feeling, requires patience, trust and understanding. In simpler terms, it takes its time, and so does 'The Green Mile'. It might be three-hour long but like so many great films, it never feels too long, which wouldn't surprise if you consider the name of the director, Frank Darabont. Like its glorious predecessor, 'The Shawshank Redemption', 'The Green Mile' embraces the passing of time with a gripping melancholy, leaving us at the end with a haunting sensation, conveyed by the titular metaphor.The Green Mile refers to the last mile walked by the condemned prisoner to the execution, and as explained by the old Paul Edgecomb (Dabbs Greer in a quite moving performance): 'the floor was the color of faded limes', hence the color. Of course, the distance is shorter than a mile, but when we get to the core of the allegory, we see that we're all sentenced to death ('We all owe a death' as says Paul) so we all, technically, have green miles of various distances. Paul Edgecomb is the hero of the film and he tells in flashback, a story set in 1935, the very year he met John Coffey, a giant black man, played by Michael Clarke Duncan, sentenced to death for the murder and the raping of two white little girls.To say that Michael Clarke Duncan delivered a magnificent performance would not only be an understatement as gigantic as his body, but it would overlook the performances of the entire cast: David Morse as Brutal Howell, the tallest and strongest guard, James Cromwell as Hal, the comprehensive warden and Patricia Clarkson, his cancer-stricken wife. The cast also includes Doug Hutchinson as Percy Whitmore, a sadistic little guard; Barry Pepper as one of the same age, much more appreciated. And in the death row, there's Michael Jeter as the simple-minded Cajun Eduard Delacroix aka Ed, and the pervert Bill Wharton, played by Sam Rockwell. If I add Harry Dean Stanton and Graham Greene in smaller roles, you have one of the greatest casts ever featured in a film.The cast plays a significant part because these are people we care about, no matter how big or small their roles are, each one shines at a moment or another, providing an extra level of depth in characterization, and when they leave us, we can't help but feel something cruelly missing, as if we were really experiencing death as a human loss. But aside from the acting, the directing and the writing are responsible for this level of empathy we feel. Indeed, the film doesn't embarrass itself with subtleties or nuances when it comes to the characters, the guards are all sympathetic and Percy is clearly the main antagonist, doing everything to be unpopular both among the guards and the viewers. And in the prisoners' group, while they're all bad people by society's standards, only Wild Bill stands out as the evil one. In the hand of another director, this wouldn't have worked, but with Darabont it does.Darabont may not be the best director of his generation, nor the best writer, but he's got one rare talent: he's a wonderful storyteller. And this talent shows in his films, he has a unique ability to transport you in his universe with such respect and carefulness that you forget all the elements that could undermine the believability of the story. How can the death row's corrections officer guards be so mild-mannered? How wasn't John Coffey lynched at the very minute he was found grabbing two little girls' bodies in his arms, what's more, by a Southern angry mob? Why falling in the 'Magic Negro' stereotype again? I was so mesmerized by the story, and so focused on the supernatural power of Coffey and the bonding it inspired in the block E, that I unconsciously wiped all these considerations.And I enjoyed 'The Green Mile' for what it was, a great MOVIE. And I emphasize the word 'movie' because there's a sort of genius in the way Darabont sticks to cinematic conventions. Darabont never hesitates to use archetypes because he's confident over his material; he knows that his screenplay is adapted from one hell of a story, written by the king Stephen. And it sure pays off, the story has the thrills of the electric chairs scenes, the heart-pounding horrific moment when the machinery goes wrong, it has the laughs, the joy, the emotion, and even a nice little comic relief incarnated by a little mouse named Mister Jingles. And not falling into the trap of anti-death penalty patronizing statements, the film speak much deeper truths about life and death, and the way love play the crucial and sometimes heart-breaking role of a missing link.The film does sometimes get a little too emotional, efficiently taking some tears from our eyes, but even tears can make us miss the more powerful message of the film for men, about the way they can miss the very purpose of life by turning evil, as one of the most insightful illustrations of evil is given, as something that exploits the best side of us for malicious schemes. Like death, you only feel evil, when it takes those you love. The film is too intelligent for its emotionality  sometimes. But nonetheless, its profound beauty always takes me  off-guard.",9,0,2,27 April 2012
The Reader," Pride and shame as parts of a fascinating equation... but a slightly disappointing resolution...
","A sickly teenager meets a woman twice his age. The early interactions are hesitant and awkward but so emotionally powerful that when the two end up making love, it feels real. I believed in the sex-driven relationship between Hanna Schmitt (Kate Winslet) and young Michael Berg (David Kross) and the way it turned to a life-changing addiction.The chemistry between Hanna and Michael is integral to the realism and I applaud the aesthetic approach of Stephen Frears who didn't sugarcoat the material because of the controversial age difference: nudity never feels gratuitous because sex is the before it gets deeper, and a new habit grows between the two lovers. Before their 'ritual intercourse', Michael reads books to Hanna, and she enjoys listening to them. There's never a more convincing expression of love in Winslet's eyes as when Michael becomes the reader instead of the lover.But time goes on, and out of sight, out of mind until Michael crosses Hanna's path again in the 60's during a trial, which will bring some answers about her personality and fascination for reading. 'The Reader' then reveals its emotional core, it is not a coming-of-age story, but a character study of two persons bounded by their romance, itself connected to painful war memories, although Michael can't remember the war but he seems to have inherited part of the guilt inhabiting Hanna's heart. And out of debatable pride, both Hanna and Michael will take the most frustrating decisions, frustrating in the sense that it doesn't serve any of their interests. Maybe this is what 'The Reader' is about: things we can't indeed understand because they're commanded by shame and pride, two parts of an insoluble equation that defined the darkest pages of German history. But 'The Reader' is another kind of Holocaust movie, the memory of the tragedy is vividly present but seldom mentioned during the film, except through a poignant testimony from the sole survivor of a church fire scene: a Jewish woman who came to identify the former guards who pushed the 'zeal' to the extreme of not opening the doors when the fire was set, among them, Hanna Schmitt.The trial is the central piece of the film, the one that connects between the opening flashback scenes, set in post-war Berlin and the 1990's where Ralph Fiennes play the older Michael. This is also the only moment where the Holocaust is straightforwardly mentioned through a horrific accusation pending on Hanna. She's accused of having signed the Jewish women's death warrant. How could she? She couldn't even read, let alone write. And this is when it gets tricky: if you personally believe that all the pride and shame in the world don't amount to much in some extreme cases, you'll have a hard time accepting the decisions of both Hanna and Michael, which I did, unfortunately.Hanna is ashamed of her illiteracy and can't publicly admit it, but then how about the shame of having ordered the deaths of three hundred women? It's not just about being a guard and following orders but about deliberately lying and pretending you decided to terminate the lives of innocent people. Basically, Hanna Schmitt would rather be accused of this crime, accepting to be remembered as an evil Nazi than an illiterate woman. We have to accept that from Hanna's standpoint, a reputation of illiteracy is worth the infamy of being remembered as a Nazi. I repeat myself because that's what the film is about: the boos, the insults and the spits in the face are small prices to keep that secret. Well, maybe that says a lot about Hanna, as there's something genuinely and unconsciously evil in the way she would rather trade her illiteracy for a crime committed under the Nazi flag, just as if one was 'less shameful' than another. But I had too much sympathy for her, to accept to believe it. The whole trial was extremely frustrating to watch, it's not just the crime but also the legacy you leave. To the film's defense, history already proved that people, notably German people, kept their mouth shut although 'they knew'. But even with the will to suspend my disbelief, I felt like the writing went through an abrupt decline when the trial started.Indeed, Hanna always talks in such a way to maintain a cloud of ambiguity over the role she played, it's like some suicidal impulses. She can just say 'I was following orders', instead of 'it was necessary' or 'I had to do it', she's like giving dim-witted comments that incriminate her more than if she gave simple but straightforward answers. It's like whatever Hanna can say, she'll say the worst possible thing to lose the jury's sympathy, and it's no wonder all the other guards ended up conspiring against her. Don't get me wrong, Winslet's performance was brilliant and deserved an Oscar, but the script kept me asking 'why doesn't one simply say that?'.Young Michael knows he can clear Hanna of her charges but after sharing his concerns with his Law teacher, played by Bruno Ganz, he chooses not to say a word, probably out of personal guilt. But even at the end, when older Michael meets the daughter of the Jewish woman, he beats around the bush. Instead of saying, 'she was illiterate', which means that she didn't give any order, so she was no guiltier than the other women. Instead of firmly establish her relative innocence, he says that she was illiterate, that he had a liaison, and it takes forever for the woman to get the point. And I'm not sure she got it.'The Reader' starts like a movie beyond any reproach but as the plot advanced, it felt like the protagonists would never say what 'normal' people would in similar situations, I understand it's for dramatization's sake, but it's a shame that near the end, realism would be traded for plot contrivances.",7,1,2,24 December 2016
Jaws," So much more than a thrilling blockbuster ...
","*** 'It's all psychological. You yell barracuda, everybody says, 'Huh? What?' You yell shark, we've got a panic on our hands.' These words come from the mouth of Mr. Vaughn, Amityville's irresponsible mayor played by Murray Hamilton. Maybe he's right to a certain extent: 'It's all psychological' but the tremendous talent of Steven Spielberg, a precocious 28-year old director, was to translate our primal fears into this terrifying experience that challenges all our perceptions.*** 'Jaws', #56 in the American Film Institute's (AFI) Top 100 Films ***A position even more impressive when you realize that 'Jaws' was doomed from the beginning. The movie had a monster-type villain, not really realistic, a B-movie plot premise, some colorful characters that confine to caricature, all the ingredients to be in the best case, a spectacular but unsubstantial success in the same vein than 'Towering Inferno' or 'Poseidon Adventure'. But 'Jaws' hid all these flaws thanks to a very masterful editing and combined the talents of many professionals at the top of their game for an effective result, and I still wonder why Spielberg didn't get an Oscar nomination for this is the true measure of his real talent. Anyways, in 1975, 'Jaws' became the most successful film ever, with an indisputable classic feeling, and one film can't reach such an iconic status, only thanks to a successful marketing campaign. If it worked, it's because it succeeded on the basic premises of a horror and thriller film, to scare and to thrill the hell out of you. *** Jaws', #2 in AFI's Top 100 Thrills ***I didn't say 'A terrifying experience that challenges all our perceptions' for the sake of it. The film plunges you in the hostile ocean's depths inhabited by a mysterious and threatening presence. Spielberg emphasizes the notion of 'presence' playing with our instinctive paranoia, basically what scares us the most is 'what we don't know but feel', or 'what we know and can't see'. The cinematography depicts the vastness of the ocean in an oddly claustrophobic way, suggesting that what we see is from the bottom, from the shark's perspective. Since our empathy is fixed on the people swimming, there's a disturbing feeling of an approaching danger when the camera slowly zooms on the victim. And when the first contact happens  well, I wasn't born at that time, I had the luck to hide under a table when I was 10, but I can imagine the effect of these bloody outbursts, high-pitched screams or disturbing gurgles in the movie theaters. I can see people jumping out of their seats, their hearts guided by the film's iconic score.**** 'Jaws', #6 in AFI's Top 25 Scores ***Each death is memorable in its own way, and as we get more familiar with the shark, the level of graphicness gets more and more gruesome. The dosage between the 'seen' and 'unseen', is so skillfully handled that the parts without the shark are sometimes more terrifying because we know the surprise is to come. As Spielberg said, half of the film's success is due to John William's score. Basically, they are only two simple notes repeated over and over again, with dramatic variations, adapted to the situation but these notes form a music that efficiently conducts the anguish in our blood till our hearts, like whispering, 'he comes – he comes – he comes' or 'danger – danger –danger'. Like 'Psycho''s screeching violins, the Oscar winning score conveys the perfect feeling of an approaching, and yes, imminent danger: the shark coming straight, from the bottom, the mouth open-wide to welcome you.**** The Shark, #17 in AFI's Top Villains ***Spielberg broke every rule regarding the deaths. My mention of two disaster films earlier isn't fortuitous since one of the genre's most stupid yet respected codes is to spare the beautiful scared girl, the kid (generally annoying), and the pet animal. Well, in 'Jaws', they are the first three victims, like the hell with conventions. The shark in an animal killer, who doesn't select his victims on a demographical basis, and this is the scariest aspect of the film, no one can be spared, the simplicity of the film presents the shark as a villain, while it's just an animal who eats for its survival. But when a shark kills such innocent creatures, how can you perceive it differently? The horrific poster alone embodies this traumatic vision of an animal ferocious and big enough to erase you from the face of the sea in one bite.*** 'You're gonna need a bigger boat', #35 in AFI's Top 100 Quotes ***The sentence describes a particularly insurmountable situation or an unbeatable enemy. But is the boat too big or the humans too small? It's the eternal fight between Men and Nature, Nature that affirms its God-like strength and human their right to colonize every space in the world, even the ocean. And the three characters, the first top billed actors embody the three different faces of this eternal fight. The Chief of Police Martin Brody (Roy Sheider) is responsible of the security, Matt Hopper (Richard Dreyfuss) is the oceanographer, who respects nature and dedicated his passionated life to sharks and Quint is the colorful and scene-stealing veteran sea captain (Robert Shaw) the man who learned from nature the way the animals should be treated. The protector, the observer, the fighter, each one feels involved with that fight, until they unite their forces for an exhilarating adventure: to kill the shark.*** I mentioned many times 'Jaws''s recognition by the American Film Institute, but what works so well is that the film is extremely well-acted, involves endearing characters, inspiring our sympathy. It's indeed about survival instinct, and a reminder that sometimes courage is about dominating one fear. This is the noblest purpose of horror films, and 'Jaws' succeeds more than any other",10,2,5,18 October 2011
The Wrestler," It's not about loving someone for his strengths, but despite his weaknesses ...
","Darren Aronofsky proved to be an uncompromising sociological expert, plunging us into the soul of people incapable to face the emptiness of their lives, and therefore filling it with what most defines their personalities. Darren is to age what Scorsese is to sin, with nothing to envy from his elder in terms of technicality, and it's only fitting that he tackled the world of sports for one of the greatest character studies of recent years.'The Wrestler' belongs to the greatest tradition of sports film, those who focus more on the career of an ex-athlete and his incapability to express himself outside his field, it reminds of the heart-breaking film noir 'Requiem for a Heavyweight' starring Anthony Quinn as an ex- champion forced to end his career after a fatal injury. 'The Wrestler' has the poignancy of these films with an extra dimension that relies on a documentary value that almost confines to naturalism, we're far from the fast-paced editing and numeral jump cuts of 'Requiem for a Dream', 'The Wrestler' looks like a film shot by a hand-held camera trying to follow the huge body of an endearing antihero, with a sad poetry forever incarnated by Mickey Rourke in one of the greatest performances of the last decade: Randy 'the Ram' Robinson.Randy is huge, strong and tall and carries the gentle sweetness of Rocky Balboa but -and that's the key difference- he's a professional wrestler and nothing else, playing a sport so unfairly snubbed but finally redeemed by cinema. Indeed, the title says it all; it's not 'Rocky' like 'Randy'. While 'Rocky' was less about a boxer than a man who wanted to go the distance, the 'Wrestler' is about a job, a profession and a passion. The film tackles the life of Randy but we all know that sooner or later, the man will get back to the ring, because this is what defines him. The beauty of sports is to allow people to express in an arena and prove their very value there, and this is precisely what undermines the conception of wrestling as a sport, and through the portrayal of Randy and all the other wrestlers, we understand that it doesn't take 'real competition' to be labeled as sports.Granted all the wrestlers fake their hits or pretend to fall, who among us would try to imitate them, or take the risk to fall on his back? Wrestling is probably the most ungrateful sport because the level of pain and exhaustion is inversely proportional to its popularity. Less than a canonic sport, it's more appreciated as an entertainment, but while athletes can stop, don't we say in entertainment: 'the show must go on'. Wrestlers are modern gladiators, almost victims of the same bad treatment, but never down, this constant overlooking cements a feeling of solidarity between the wrestlers. Aronofski powerfully creates a contrast between the gory details and really gruesome and painful actions with the relative courtesy and gentleness of these guys, like some sort of real-life gentle giants, men who love and respect each other, and respect their fans, and this is what drives them, what drives Randy, more particularly.And Randy had everything, he used to be popular on the ring, he had his name shouted by the fans, he even had his figurine actions, those were the flashy 80's. But somewhere between, he screwed around, distanced from his family, his wife; he drank, lost his appeal and became a caricature of himself forcing to stand thanks to medics. Randy becomes an outcast and what other choice he had than befriending other ones: an aging strip teaser named Cassidy, played by Marisa Tomei. Both have kids and can only contemplate the degradation of a world, ironically too cynical for them. Both are uneducated and can only count on their body as precious assets with a limited date. There's this sense of urgency to find a meaning for life before it's too late, and the film takes a tragic pivot when Randy suffers from a heart attack and is forced to finish his career for his health, at the risk of becoming a nobody.The film progresses as the powerful journey of a man trying to find an opportunity in order to fight his inner demons. If he was dumb enough to lose everything because at least he could fulfill his passion, well, maybe his incapacity to play is an opportunity to fix everything, more importantly his relationship with his daughter, played by Evan Rachel Wood, having a job, and becoming a regular guy. Of course, as it comes with Aronofski's films, characters are given personalities and natures that they can hardly escape from, and what contributes to cement our empathy is precisely in the realistic way they remind us, that we can only remain true to our nature. In a heartbreaking scene with his daughter, Randy asked her not to hate him, and a tear runs from his eyes, I don't think the tear is about the past, because she already forgave him, but for the future because it's like he knew he would end up screwing again, but it would never be badly intentioned.We all make mistakes in real life, that's what makes it an even more difficult arena, so there's still an ambiguity in what would be Randy's decision : getting on the ring again, is it brave because he would risk his health and even death for that or coward because he took the only thing he mastered and didn't try to improve elsewhere. That's the power of the Wrestler, it questions our own capacity to change and to adapt, and to go the distance of our own lives before making the courageous decision about what we want to do, at any prices. I guess that's what makes Randy a particularly heroic character, eager to sacrifice everything for what he loves. One of the best of 2008, if not the best.",10,1,2,6 February 2012
Hancock," A 'kick-ass' film and the film 'Kick-Ass' should have been...
","Peter Berg's 'Hancock' really took me off-guard, I avoided it for many years expecting some spoof of the superhero movie genre, which I'm not even a fan to begin with. And the beginning almost fooled me, a spectacular car chase intercut with a hung-over Hancock (Will Smith) sleeping on a bench and awaken by that kid from 'The Middle'. It takes him a while to get up, which is plausible for someone who still got the bottle in his hand, and when he took off, it just reminded me of Woody's comment about Buzz: he doesn't fly, he falls in style. And for some strange reason, despite all the obvious CGI, the flying stunts looked realistic and that's one of the delights of 'Hancock'.Indeed, there's no reason to have a superhero flying like some torpedo, missile or rocket, Hancock's flying consist of high jumping and trying to fall on the right spot, which doesn't go without costing a few bucks to the community. And when he stops the criminals by impaling their car over a tower after a ride that had its share of collateral damages, Hancock's not exactly acclaimed like a hero but booed and insulted. It's so fun and refreshing to see movies questioning the consequences of a superhero's action, 'The Incredibles' did that in 2004 but 'Hancock' takes that element seriously and it's the right tone. If it wasn't serious, it would have made his character a major goofball we would have instantly liked, but the point isn't to like Hancock.Precisely, he's a bitter, ill-mannered man who couldn't care less but for some reason, still cares. So when PR executive Ray (Jason Bateman) is stuck on the railroad Hancock saves him from the train collision by throwing his car backwards (instead of taking it away) and causes a train wreck by blocking it. After that, Ray sees the man who's just saved his life being insulted by an angry crowd, and naturally, decides to help him back by restoring his heroic public image. He invites Hancock to his house where he meets his son Aaron and his wife Mary (Charlize Theron) who obviously looks at him just like Jean Arthur looked at Alan Ladd in 'Shane'. We haven't seen enough movies if we don't guess there's history between them, but whatever expectation we have, it'll be a big surprise.Another surprise is in the interesting shift of genres, from comedy to drama, with an intermediary section set in a jail. The sequence shows all the efforts to rehabilitate Hancock, we see him handling the prisoners, sometimes it contributes to hilarious sight gags that remind us not to take the material too seriously, and sometimes we see the 'Will Smith' of 'Happyness' and 'Seven Pounds' trying to change, to be a better man. His presence in the jail is vital to the development of his character since he can go out at any time but he's ready to play the game, to accept the rules, except maybe when it comes to 'shooting some b-ball' outside the court. After serving part of his sentence, learning a few lessons about how to congratulate the police force, how to fly and land without causing major damages and learning to be nice, the test comes.Hancock's called for an emergency, he shaves his beard, puts on a tight uniform with an eagle logo and go meet his destiny. He stops the robbery in all professionalism and efficiency, earning him finally the cheers of the by-standers, the police and the journalists. This is where the choice to have a serious action picture instead of a comedy pays off, if Hancock was comical, his ovation at the bank would have been a triumphant and happy moment, instead, it's a moving and emotional epiphany for him, and a fine transition to the third act that finally reveals the deal between Mary and Hancock. And it's such a particular story that it could have been handled in a sequel but the Mary storyline with a revenge from a few villains tie up the plot together in a heart-pounding finale.And I was surprised Roger Ebert didn't mention it in his review, because the climax reminded me totally of the bond between Elliott and E.T the Extra-Terrestrial and it might even reveal what the film is ultimately about: energy. There is a positive energy and a negative one, Hancock had the same forces and skills but before he turned into a decent guy, he was full of negative vibrations that impacted his actions. He couldn't stand people calling him a certain name maybe because he used that same insult against himself. By interiorizing his doubts, his wounds, his questions about his past for years and years, he turned himself into that bitter jerk. Ray could finally unveil the good side of him and allow him to ope to people, it's an interesting metamorphosis from one energy to another.And naturally there's the energetic connection between Hancock and Mary whose respective backstories are finally revealed and make the final confrontations not just spectacular but incredibly poignant. 'Hancock' is a good movie because it's about a superhero who's a good man surrounded by good persons and learn how to be even better not just by being brave or polite but also selfless. And in the way Berg mixes between genres, from action-packed comedy to emotional drama, I will say that 'Hancock' kicks ass and is the film 'Kick-Ass' should have been.",8,2,2,30 September 2019
Hitch," A Rom-Com where the Rom is all a matter of Comm'...
","It was my 37th birthday party, I was leaving the restaurant, my friend saw the girl I used to be in love with from the third grade, I left the place Roadrunner style.
My friend approached her, so I went back, we talked for what was the most magical half-hour since my divorce, and I left the place on a cloud of happiness I never thought I would experience again. I would love to contact her again, but how to? She's been so inaccessible that I feel like I've reached the limit and trying more would spoil that triumphant taste. So I guess what 'Hitch' got right was that dizziness you feel where you're in love and the devouring desperation that ensues.The film gets more cinematic when the seduction involves the kind of tricks and planning that would have made Paul Newman's Gondorff jealous. Alex Hitchens' methods involve a lot of scheming, programming and digging private data about the target, so that the slogan might be 'do the stalking before the talking' but in all good spirit as the whole process is wrapped up in the sheer conviction that any man can get any woman once he puts his mind into it, with the only concession to romanticism is that the man must truly love the woman. In other words, Alex Tennant's 'Hitch' is a splendid example of the kind of movies Hollywood could never make again.The film doesn't insult women but it kind of belittles their involvement in the romantic process, or underlines a certain passiveness status-wise: the man has got to be in love (that's Hitch' creed as he doesn't let a prick get a woman for sex) and the man's got to do the job, to masquerade as someone as smooth as a cat and as cool as ice when in fact, he's at the verge of having a seizure, it's a harrowing journey but it's all worth it. And the girl's job is to notice the man and gets interested enough to accept a date, then she's got to validate the good feelings, and then she's got to be conquered.So, on the surface, 'Hitch' belongs to the second school of romances when one of the two protagonists must conquer the other and let's admit it, it generally happens to be the guy. The other school involves more mutual attractions such as 'When Harry Met Sally...' when only one of the two is a small step behind the other, but it's a collaborative job, interestingly we're talking of a movie written by a woman. Guess what? 'Hitch' is not, but the fact that it is male-centric doesn't invalidate one theory or two it's got about the laws of attraction.Let assume for the sake of argument that it's not a man's job to get the girl, that ever since the dawn of history, the desire of possession has never been a matter of gender, then Hitch only points out that some guys don't have the right packaging to fulfill their goals. They represent the silent majority, they're overweight, bespectacled, sometimes both, they're short, nerdish, dorks, bald, and dream of women who play in total different leagues. That's the angle taken by Hitch, their consultant, a man who knows all the do's and don't of the art of seduction, a street-smart upper-class version of Cupid or the Charming Prince of Bel-Air.And Will Smith is not only the perfect choice for such a role but what he accomplishes is interesting, obviously his competence as a matchmaker can't do without a fair deal of manipulation, but it's never played out at the expenses of women's image. It's more of an end justifying the means, with the means never interfering with the likability Hitch' clients. On that level, Kevin James is always adorable as Alber, the dorky accountant who catches the eye of the beautiful Allegra (Amber Valleta) after one hell of a rant against his boss, and against her own passiveness too when it comes to business.And no matter how Allegra is genuinely in love with Albert, there's no way it could happen if Hitch hadn't paved the road to that realization. But that would be too easy, and the plot threatens his perfect streak with a big challenge, his own. Sara Melas, played by the sensual and smart Eva Mendes, is the tough nut to crack, a gossip columnist who doesn't fall for any man but seems interested in Hitch. Many of their dates turn sour, forcing him to revise his theories, but while he makes loser get the girl by succeeding, it's through the little incidents (some comical and some played from drama) that he touches Sara's heart.Still, we've seen enough rom-com to know it's a matter of time before the schemes must backfire so we get to the rule that every school of romance must respect: there's no true love without the truth. That might be love's dirtiest trick, covering your weaknesses long enough to finally unveil them once the heart is conquered. The irony is that's how the film works as well, it starts as a witty little crossover between 'The Sting' and 'The Graduate' but then ventures in the 'idiot' plot when Sara believes Hitch coached the playboy prick. She could at least give him the benefit of the doubt and hear his version before doing such a big thing as spreading it on her columns?The last part was a bit far-fetched but for its overall sensibility, its tendency to make men appear as lovable fools and women as not-so easily fooled individuals, after all, communication can't do without a little pinch of manipulation. But anyway, for a man's film, 'Hitch' finds a fair balance between the old and new school of romance, it can appeal to any group, any sex and it carris a sweet, tender and almost nostalgic resonance in our 'battle of the sexes' driven era.",7,0,0,20 September 2019
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Ten Simple Reasons Why 'Attack of the Sith' is the 'Sith'
","(and sorry for the lame pun) WAR! Now, that's how you start a movie: right to the point and catchy. Compare this to the opening of 'Phantom Menace' that sounded like the intro of some Yale student thesis. Here, there's no 'trade' this, no 'taxation' that, no Republic or Congress or other political considerations, we're not in Munich, Hitler invaded Poland already. So, war is in everyone's minds and the opening mission with Obi-Wan and Anakin (rescuing Senator Palpatine) shows that there's no time to waste anymore. I don't know if Lucas listened to fans' angry comments but they probably had a good feeling with that opening, and the rest wouldn't cause any further disappointment. So, if nothing is more valuable than a first impression, 'Sith' is a winner.BYE-BYE JAR-JAR: Although he didn't annoy me as much as everyone complained about but it seems that the film makes a point in not having anything to do with the first opuses, and certainly not the most infamous of all connections. He caused enough trouble already by giving full power to Palpatine, while there are some contrivances and clichés one can't go through, we've had enough of all 'missa' and 'youssa' polluting our ears.THEY'RE ALL HERE, ONE LAST TIME: Of course, they were all here from the start with the exception of Christensen who jumped on the wagon midway, but when we meet them again, we've got the feeling to see old friends who learned to know each other. It's almost like in 'Return of the Jedi' without that touch of self-awareness that made it a little bit more light-hearted, Han Solo smiled a lot, there were too many gags and the Ewoks didn't help. In 'Sith', we know the final showdown is coming and the characters are approaching the end of their journey, and not a happy one of course. So, it's like tragedy on march, they're helpless while driven by the best intentions.ANAKIN SKYLWALKER: He's given more substance in the film and while the gradual transition to his evil counterpart isn't a masterpiece of subtlety, Christensen displays a wider range of emotions and stops being this whiny kid from the second film, inhabiting the final gasp of his human life with a poignancy I didn't expect. Not to mention, he looks better with that haircut. Well, he got another Razzie nomination anyway but that was more than debatable.EXECUTE ORDER 66: How to wipe out all the Jedi in a bad-ass move that pays tribute to my favorite film of all time, 'The Godfather'. Now, while not in the same vein than the 'Baptism Massacre', Lucas' nice nod to his mentor and buddy Francis provides perhaps the second most famous example of cinematic purges ever. And the effect is even more powerful since the bad guys win. That's the start of a tragedy ending with Anakin finally renouncing Satan.IT ESCALATES QUICKLY: Overall, the whole last hour of the film plays like a tragic escalation and a heart-pounding climax with a mountain of lava as the unforgettable operatic arena, perhaps one of the greatest climactic fights of the saga, the one was that trilogy begging for, having characters act and stop having bad feelings about things.THE PREQUEL REDEMPTION: The climax redeems the previous films' flaws through the final chain of events starting with Anakin finally surrendering to the realm of the Dark Side, under the tempting offer of Emperor Palpatine while all the other Jedi dismissed him. When the fight ends with Anakin severely burnt, Padme giving birth and slowly dying and Obi-Wan leaving, there's something really emotional that rewards our patience. When Padme calls Luke and Leia by their name, it hits a sensitive chord, that moment is the closest to the greatness of the first trilogy.A NEW HOPE: Exactly! The film ends right before the first of a few years. And after the final images showing each characters' arc, including Darth Vader's transformation, you just can't wait for the 'next' trilogy, but everything already happened, Lucas made the stunt to build something up to events we already know, which makes the ending even more powerful, like a cliffhanger for something that wouldn't virtually happen since it already did.LUCAS' REDEMPTION: The trilogy doesn't play in the same league than the others, I even said that 'Jedi' was better than the three prequels put together, but now, I have reservation for 'Sith' which I consider even slightly more enjoyable than 'Jedi', emotionally at least, because it's hard to think that a three-movie epic set-up ended up being defeated by creatures like the Ewoks,l. But by making something as powerful as 'Sith', Lucas proved that this trilogy was still his baby, and he achieved his dream by adding new ramifications to an already dense universe, you just can't get far enough in a galaxy, far, far away.ULTIMATE MYTH: I guess there was something disappointing in the fact that people thought they'd never see their beloved Leia and Luke, which encouraged Lucas to write the next opus 'The Force Awakens', maybe it says a lot about 'Star Wars', it probably comes to a point that it doesn't even belong to Lucas but to human posterity, it's a cinematic mythology that can only demand to be enriched with new and new adventures, just like these suspending dots the opening texts end with...",8,3,4,11 August 2017
Ray," The artist with millions of records... and a few to settle...
","Taylor Hackford's 'Ray' covers all the usual ingredients of the musical biopic: the miserable childhood, the 'revelation', the rise to success and its deal of collateral damages from addictions to marital troubles, mental breakdowns, business stuff and so on and so forth, the whole thing wrapped up in frenetic headline-driven editing and a terrific soundtrack. 'Ray' features the whole package and yet it works. It works because music has that little edge over the other genres when they bend with the biography picture: the singer is never the same, the music too. And when the central figure happens to be one of the most beloved and iconic singers of the last century, you've already won the emotional involvement of the average movie lover.I'm not generally stingy on superlatives but 'Ray' is one of the greatest music-movie of all time because it met with the most hit-or-miss requirement: the casting. Jamie Foxx doesn't play nor does he impersonate Ray Charles, he IS Ray Charles, apart from the singing voice (that could only belong to Ray), he's got the looks, the mimics, it strikes how Foxx played Ray Charles to the core, to the tiniest details such as shoulders contraction, that smile you never can tell when it's genuine, defensive or nervous, that stuttering, it is really digging very deeply and I was impressed by the level of dedication that allowed Foxx to channel Ray. Foxx was a singer and even a piano player, maybe the hardest part was over, but playing a piano without seeing and making it feel genuine and believable needed training, patience and one hell of a dedication.I could go on and on about the acting, Foxx' Oscar was overdue and his work was of a magnitude that matched Ray's legacy. You need believable acting to believe in the miracle that allowed a blind man to become a music legend, and not make it as the usual story of the man overcoming the handicap but rather using it as a defining part of him, for better or worse. Blindness heightened Ray's other perceptions, such as hearing, feeling, touching. Maybe that extra-sensitivity forged his capability to hear the pulses of the human soul like no one, to touch the hearts of people or make them pound to the tempo of his own spirit, to believe that the gospel could mix with rhythm and blues, pioneering the soul music while venturing in so many various styles, you can't really classify Ray Charles. He was blind maybe, but he could see what we couldn't, and there's no magical 'John Coffey' behind it, it's just the school of life, and a mother who taught him everything the hard way.The screenplay makes no secret that it is Ray Charles' blindness that transcended him while being his heaviest burden. Charles became blind after a traumatic childhood episode, having witnessed his brother drowning without even trying to save him, frozen by fear. The vision was so upsetting that his eyes couldn't sustain it, but his mother who raised him in poverty taught him to never let anyone believe he was crippled. Charles' strength was that he didn't see himself as a colored man in racist America but as a blind man surrounded by color-blind wolves. That's an insight people with vision don't get, Charles learned from the start not to trust anyone. He wants success, he wants money, he's not just some 'artist' and that's what I like about the film, it doesn't sugarcoat the image of the singer, he went to the best offer and could leave or fire his 'friends'. Ray meant business.But there's a catch, Ray was also a troubled man who lived in the dark and couldn't lead his way to success without a few ethical shortcuts. He married a good woman Della Bea (Kerry Washington) who gave him children but she knew he couldn't be the man of one woman. Charles was addicted to women like heroin and the film mostly focuses with his romances with Mary Ann Fisher and Margie Hendricks (Regina King) and you can see that his vices were always making up for that darkness, lusting for pleasures that can do without vision, getting high or feeling a body, or something in his body. Charles doesn't lie to himself, he believes in God but has some records to settle with him and only near the end that he comes to term after his rehab, so the film can conclude.Indeed, there's not much room for heavy dramatization after the 60's, except for the rehabilitation in Georgia, the state he had in his mind, inspiring its very anthem. At the end, 'Ray' is the portrait of a musical genius who happened to be a womanizer, a drug-addict, a businessman, and all these facets of his personality that we explore through the film allow us to understand the price of success, you can't just get to the top with millions of fans without disappointing a few who love you. And you can't sing the Gospels without flirting with the Devil because letting all the repressed feelings explodes is the best way to put 'art' in cathartic. And while the trope of a banal situation ending up inspiring a hit song is very familiar, in the case of 'Hit the Road Jack' and 'What'd I say', you're so entertained by the music that you accept these artistic licenses.And speaking of the songs, I just can't resist to that opening theme of 'Night time is the Right Time' that fuses that perfect mix of sleaziness, sensuality and a little something that prepares you to feel a song before dancing to it. Ray Charles was blind, he was in perpetual night time but, as the song say, that night time was the right time to reinvent music.",9,2,4,10 March 2017
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," The One That Started it All ...
","'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' is the triumph of guts, imagination and talent, an outstanding mixture that only a visionary genius like Walt Disney could have concocted. He was told it was a folly that would bankrupt his company, no one would endure bright colors and little creatures fooling around on a big screen for more than an hour but since when do geniuses listen? 'It all started with a mouse' loved to remind Walt Disney, as an encouragement for people to believe in their dreams and never underestimate the magical value of the smallest creations. The road for success is paved from these little ideas, visions and intuitions  even the iconic Mickey Mouse would have been named Mortimer if it wasn't for a precious advice from Disney's wife. And starting with his iconic mascot, Walt Disney established a real laboratory on the field of animation. It was the famous 'Silly Symphonies' era that brought up to screen so many enchanting cartoons, featuring animals, trees, flowers and music in the purest tradition of European storytelling. When you compare 'Flowers and Trees', first animated cartoon in colors made in 1932, with the unforgettable 'Band Concert', made three years later, you realize how impressive the progresses were but when you see 'The Old Mill', 1937 classic masterpiece of realism, you immediately get the feeling of a crucial step finally reached, and asking for something more adult, more revolutionary  Mickey Mouse and the 'Silly Symphonies' contributed to the success of the Walt Disney company but what Disney needed was a flourishing empire, a bigger project that probably started with an innocent 'what if' question. Making an animated feature  think about it, in term of works, it's probably equivalent of making ten or twelve animated films with the same level of artistry as 'The Old Mill' with the whole gallery of emotions we would expect from a film: thrills, laughs, passion, endearing characters and memorable songs. I make it sound like a 'business plan', but we're talking of the then highest grossing film of all time on which the whole existence of the Disney Company was jeopardized. If only for that, 'Snow White' deserves all the praises for having been one of the most groundbreaking creations, on the same sensational level as 'Star Wars', 40 years later. And Disney couldn't have thought of a better story to begin with. 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' is in total aesthetic harmony with the 'Silly Symphonies' (the setting, the presence of animals) and the drawing, especially of the dwarfs as cartoon characters, was the final step of what was developed during a whole decade by the Disney studios, inspired from the old classic European drawings that always had a sort of cartoon feel. 'Snow White' stylish simplicity makes it appealing on a universal and timeless level. It can look old but never dated, and Disney proved his international ambitions by allowing the foreign animation studios to adapt the frameworks to their own language. Disney meant business And the result is a triumph of both storytelling and perfectionism, Disney didn't think animation and made it into a film, he thought of a realistic film first, hence encouraged his staff to use classic designs to draw the face of Snow White, the Prince, and the Evil Queen, they might look very basic compared to Disney's following works but they're human enough to suspend the disbelief that we're watching a cartoon, an important element in order to catch the interest of the adults and awakes their inner child. And the film respected the viewer's comfort so much that the use of relief, perspective, zooming and lights and shadows was made in a constant attention to the smallest realistic details, and on that level, the making-of of 'Snow White' is an inspirational encouragement for work and perfectionism, with dreams fulfillment as the pay-off. Another interesting aspect relies on the character of Snow White herself, so unfairly mentioned as one of the least interesting Disney heroines, when her main interest was to be a foil for the dwarfs and the villain. The dwarfs prove how intuitive Disney was for his first film, as they allowed to provide a set of seven different personalities with an almost three-dimensional value, this is the fantastic trick of the film, try to watch the other versions of Snow White, and you'll see how cruelly lacking a personality the dwarfs are. It's almost impossible to think of them without visualizing Dopey, Doc, Sneezy, Grumpy, Sleepy, Happy and Bashful. And Snow White is the central of that universe, like the emotional core of the film that justifies the dwarfs' comicality, the Prince's passion and the Queen's evilness, another aspect of the film that provides it a timeless feel. The Evil Queen embodies the combination of beauty and vanity, she's so cold, she looks like a modern woman with an undeniable sex-appeal, and if one thing, she's the very proof of the Disney Golden Rule, there's no good Disney film without a great villain.And thanks to a final and successful pacing, the rest is history and like every classic masterpiece, each scene of 'Snow White' is a classic on its own, the forest with eyes, the dwarfs coming from home, the Queen's haunting metamorphosis, so many songs forever engraved in our memories, 'Whistle While you work', 'Heigh-Ho', 'Someday my Prince Will Come' the party and a finale that would make all the people, kids or adults, in the world cry and laugh, and finally cheer  discovering the Disney effect, that for each laugh, there would be a tear, a feeling that would last for many decades over and over again.Thank you, Mr. Disney for your contribution to the world of animation, film-making and entertainment!",10,2,2,23 November 2011
The Lion King," Remember what Disney used to be ...
","It's an interesting coincidence that 'The Lion King' was released one year before the groundbreaking 'Toy Story': the first animated feature in 3D that would pave the way for a new kind of family entertainment. 'The Lion King' is the Disney Renaissance period at its pinnacle and probably the last hand-drawn Disney classic.Now, I won't mention Pixar and the 3D animated features again, because I want, for once, to take a big plunge and get back to that magical year that was 1994. Disney Renaissance was this unexpected animated streak that started with 'The Little Mermaid' and brought up memorable masterpieces such as 'Beauty and the Beast' and 'Aladdin', which finally elevated the world of Animation to the same level of spectacular greatness and respectability than live-action films. But I think there are two words that get often mixed up : masterpieces and classics, a movie can be an excellent technical accomplishment but for some reasons, it gets less recognition than a minor film. I like 'Mermaid', the two B's and I'm a big fan of 'Aladdin', they might be classic in terms or notoriety, but there are more of animated masterpieces, while it can be said about 'The Lion King' that it's not only a masterpiece, but also a timeless classic.'The Lion King' is not an exhilarating adventure, nor a passionate romance, not a comic film, it's a wonderful coming-of-age story, focusing on the most universal values that guide our lives. On that level, the film is to Disney Renaissance what 'Bambi' was to the Golden Age. And the comparison here is not fortuitous, 'The Lion King' works almost as an adult drama whose most important theme is succession and passing of time, with the interesting notion that Simba, the central character, must conquer a lost title back. From the opening, we get the full meaning of the eternal cycle of time, with a rising sun announcing the birth of the new Prince, and all the animals of the savanna coming to pay respect to the King Mufasa's newborn son. The opening sequence of 'The Lion King' with Elton John's 'Circle of Life' is probably one of Disney greatest movie moments ever, and the proof, it it ever was needed, of that Disney capability to touch hearts and command our feelings with the simple magic use of motion and colors.This sequence and every following frame highlight the perfect mastery of every technical element : the animation, the dazzling cinematography with the perfect use of reliefs and colors to illustrate the diversity of a rich animal microcosm, the direction, the music, I mean both the score and the songs, the characters and probably more than anything, the story. It's about succession, family, life and death, jealousy and betrayal with the villain whose no one but the King's brother, Scar, whose suave voice from Jeremy Irons, provides a touch I would qualify as 'Shakespearian', a more sophisticated word for 'universal'. But forget these big words, because to understand why 'The Lion King' is such an endearing classic, we have to regard it through the eyes of those who discovered the film as kids. In 'The Lion King', there's no romance, it's not about getting the girl, or the boy, the main character is a kid who wants to become like his father, who learns about the meaning of life, of courage and more than anything, of his identity, something sacred based on two pivotal elements : heritage and family, the past and the future, the very position in the circle of life. We can all relate to Simba as kids and as adults. And generally, the Disney stories that are centered on a kid are more appealing : 'Dumbo' was about difference's acceptance, 'Pinocchio' about responsibilities, 'The Fox and the Hound' about tolerance, 'Jungle Book' about  not that one was just pure fun  Romances rely on so many elements of predictability it easily undermines their appeal, and to recognize Disney romances, they're generally the ones where you most remember the scene-stealing sidekicks or comic relief characters.In 'The Lion King', Simba is the heart of the story, and we follow him during an epic journey in life, with his father and mentor, Mufasa, the King with that naturally authoritarian James Earl Jones' voice. Just thinking of the scene where they play at night gives me shudders, and I mean it : any boy close to his father can understand that level of tenderness and love  and of course, it makes the following sequence even more horrific, but this is what makes the film so memorable. Generations of kids have been traumatized by Bambi mom's death, why sparing ours? As usual, in Disney films, death, if not part of life, is part of a learning process, tragic but necessary. This is 'The Lion King', a wonderful story, populated by a gallery of (literally) colorful characters following an extraordinary soundtrack with so many unforgettable catchy songs, that lurched the film into pop culture memories : 'Hakuna Matata !' If there was ever a music associated with 1994, it would belong to 'The Lion King', and I'm glad it won an Oscar for this, as I'm glad Hans Zimmer won for the score too, as it probably is the musical expression of the film's emotional power. The conclusion of the film where Simba gets back on the top of the rock and starts roaring give me thrills (just thinking of it) and never fails to make me cry.There are no words to describe what makes 'The Lion King' so great. It's like the Disney team decided to combine all the efforts for a last masterpiece ... that would become one of the greatest animated films ever. So great I would have loved that the ghost of Walt Disney would haunt them every once in a while, saying : 'Remember who you are'",10,3,5,16 October 2011
Inception," From 'Inception' to Deception : a Review within a review within a rev....
","Regardless of my definitive opinion, this is a 'sensational' film and a mind-bending one like I've never seen before. And guess what ? I think I was victim of its own concept since I went through four stages of reviews with 'Inception', one within another (naturally) :REVIEW 1 : Ecstasy in Perception ...~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~'This is not a film, This is an experience ... a cinematic 'Bohemian Rhapsody' ... This is why I love movies ... why imagination is the greatest human gift ... why I dream to write such creative and intelligent stories ... And still ... I don't know how to feel ... Movies like this should be praised and loved ... I loved it, but I feel something messy now in my mind, and that I can't get out ... I need to watch it again ... this is not a movie to watch once ... definitely ... it's so disturbing it's great, so great it's disturbing ...' 10/10This is the raw feeling, authentic? sincere? naive? well it was the immediate one, one that couldn't be altered by other viewer's opinions, praises or criticisms. This is how I felt when the movie ended. A second watching transported me from ecstasy in perception to ...REVIEW 2 : Originality in Conception ...~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~'It's a dazzling intelligence-challenging puzzle, but only on an intellectual level, not emotional. Why not? Should all the movies have a 'heart' beating inside ... as long as it makes yours do. Now I understand the film and love it because I decided not to care for the emotion and just try to understand the story. And with this mindset, believe me, 'Inception' is an incredible experience. The movie is a fantasy and remains realistic in the same time, it's real because we know it's fake, but the fake world feels so real because we can technically live in. It doesn't say anything about dreams and subconsciousness, because it's all about actual and virtual reality, perceptions and intentions. As a script, it's a very impressive work from Christopher Nolan, not to mention the brilliant editing. Yes, I know I'm watching a film, but this one I value as an intricate puzzle that challenges my intelligence. 'Inception' is like a cinematic Rubik's cube.' 9,5/10I was still loving the film, but in the meantime, starting to concede that the enjoyment was more on a technical level, on the construction of the plot and the intricacy of the script ... I admitted that the whole Mal-Cobb subplot was just plot devices to insert a melodrama, necessary to plunge us in Cobb's subconscious and inject it into Fisher's dreams, combining this way two parallel worlds, two narrative structures. In such action-driven films, 'forced' is 'flat' and melodrama must be handled carefully. The movie was perceived as excellent by my humble mind, but more in a cinematographic, geometric, almost pragmatic way ... which brings me to ...REVIEW 3 : Enthusiasm in Reception ...~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~'It's a great film that should grab the Oscars for Best Original Screenplay, Best Editing, Best Visual Effects, Sound Effects, Best Cinematography. If it didn't, there would be no justice!' 8/10I knew I enjoyed the movie because as I mentioned before, it featured great thrills, action, script, music, editing, visuals ... hence the word 'sensational' I used in the beginning of this review. But as I titled in another review : 'many elements of greatness don't necessarily make a great film'. I started to question myself. It's a film about dreams, about subconscious, right? but did I sense a real escapism in those supposedly dreamy settings? didn't those dreams look a little bit like micro-episodes from formulaic action films? could the fights (or anything for that matter) be more imaginative? did the Mal-Cobb subplot make me feel sympathy for any of them? did I really care for Cobb? or did Leo make me care for his character? did I care for the whole mission? did any of the characters appeal to me? So many interrogation marks leading me to the 'Limbo' review ...REVIEW 4 : Realism in Deception ...~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~'Wow ... this movie has a really strange power, it leaves me ecstatic when it finishes, and then the more I think about it, the more I realize that the very aspect that made me love the film could've been handled in a better way and with a deeper characterization: less chase scenes and shootings, more imagination and by that, I mean more beautiful settings and creative plot devices ... This movie is a cinematic experience that makes you scratch your head and hold your breath, but does it deserve all the praise? I wonder how I fell for this one, but I think it's time to retract myself and admit my judgment mistake. Yes, the movie is a cinematic Rubik's cube, but I guess I forgot how I used to get quickly bored by this game. How did I change my mind ? ... I don't know ... thinking, reading, realizing, sharing views, using this mind 'Inception' tried to twist ... A very creative film, I wish it will win all the Oscars previously mentioned, but beyond the creativity of the concept ... what did I enjoy? I guess only the concept, the rest was just ... all flash and no substance' 6/10Yep, the rating also fell through 4 'layers' ... what a painful awakening, this movie amazed me so much, I couldn't feel anything negative about it ... and one thing for sure, 'Inception' has the weirdest power of attraction when you watch it for the first time, that's why I understand its popularity. It's like my mind had already accepted the idea that the movie would be a masterpiece just because it relied on a particularly innovative concept. Or was I just victim of an 'Inception' called Marketing?",6,10,17,6 January 2011
WALL·E," Not the emotional torrent I expected, should I apologize?
","'Wall-E' elicited such a strong emotional response I feel almost guilty not to have been overwhelmed the way I expected.Right now, it is still occupying the same spot it conquered on IMDb's Top 250, along with with 'The Dark Knight' (although a bit lower). Those were the two cinematic events of the year and they seem to have stand the test of time and proved that they were more than timely phenomena. And yes, you can't help but praise the technological achievement 'Wall-E' represents, and how complex it must have been to create such a unique character. But whether one character (or two) makes a movie is another matter.Indeed, I have nothing against slow-pacing but 'Finding Nemo' took you right into the relationship between Marlin and his son through a powerful five-minute opening sequence, 'Wall-E' demands more patience and I'm fine with that but the more you wait, the more emotionally rewarding you expect the outcome to be. Well, 'Wall-E' starts as a cute character and ends having a cute relationship; it's not exactly the most fascinating character's arc of Disney history. That's all right because there's a genuine likability in this character but he's too one-dimensional to carry an eighty-minute film, that's how I felt at least.I guess I had the same reaction than with the movie 'Up' (I saw both movies twice to make sure it wasn't just something I'd miss at first viewing). I liked the film, I can see why some moments garnered such universal critical acclaim, with 'Wall-E', Pixar studios made quite a creation, cute as a button, with his mechanical 'body' language, the way he moves his binocular eyes, whizzes the name 'Eve' (that 'Eeee-vah' turned me on for some reason) and use his shovel arms, he manages to be both RD-D2 and Charlie Chaplin. And through Wall-E, Pixar have achieved something remarkable, another remarkable stunt, making a silent romance, made only of squeaking, buzzing and rolling and various object sounds.They also made an environmentalist movie with a prophetic message about the future that awaits our Planet, Wall-E being the only robot to have developed sentience (thanks Wikipedia, I just learned a new word) and is capable to have feelings and reactions to his environment. Of course, you got to wonder how his feeling capability made him immortal and how he's supposed to be a 'he', do machines have gender or what? But these are the kind of contrivances we accept in the name of suspension of disbelief. The level of realism reached in the first act, believe it or not, makes the whole thing plausible. Because I would be believe Earth would end up like a human-less gigantic dump. Where the animals are is another question the film doesn't answer but there's a nice little character named Hal the cockroach who provides company to Wall-E, until Eve arrives and then the story takes off (for some reason, Hal doesn't seem to care about meeting a female cockroach, or is he the 'Omega' cockroach as well?) But I'm digressing here, let's get back to the 'Up' parallel. The sci-fi sequence felt like the zeppelin part in 'Up', it came at a time where the movie needed an antagonist to advance the plot, and while there's nothing much to criticize about the part; it doesn't hit the same sensitive chord than the first act. What is the most memorable part in 'Up'? Yes, the romantic montage. So it's like 'Up' and 'Wall-E' are great concept movies, but it's like they rely on that simple principle defined by Howard Hawks (it's been a while since I didn't quote him) which is that a good movie if made of three good scenes and no bad scenes. If you stretch the notion of scene to sequences, you have a winner in 'Wall-E', the encounter with Eve, the kiss in space and any other scene involving the humans. But that there aren't many bad scenes doesn't mean there's something to enjoy apart from the three memorable moments.This takes me to the initial point: does the character make the film? Is 'Wall-E' so cute and adorable that we need to follow him for almost twenty minutes, it dragged on for so long that even when EVE came, I wasn't really enthusiastic, I was more like 'God, we had the Wall-E alone, we'll have the Wall-E trying to make up with her'. Maybe I expected too much but I had just watched 'Finding Nemo' again and the film proved that you can mix up heart with action with great visuals without trying to pull a '2001' and make something mature, especially when the film ends with the cartoonish representation of obese humans living in a star-liner. I liked that twist but I was wondering if the characters really belonged to the same movies, the paradox of 'Wall-E' is that the robots are given more realism, depth and substance than the humans.So I'm wondering if 'Wall-E' wasn't actually a short film material, and the whole plot with the vessel and the mission could have been used for another movie. Maybe not but then I can't really say I enjoyed every bit, not as I would expect from such a universally praised film. Just because it deals with environmentalist issues and sends a powerful message about the way we treat Earth doesn't make it superior to any Miyazaki movie for that matter. Yes, I admire the feat of the creation of 'Wall-E', but I don't think he was able to carry the film with his frail shovel hands.And believe me, it's not that I didn't care, when the film ended, I put on the DVD bonus features and the part with the sound recording and sound design had me literally glued to the screen, it's very telling when you enjoy the making of the film, more than the film itself.",8,0,0,20 August 2017
Finding Dory," Finding Money...
","'Finding Nemo' was such a self-sufficient and satisfying masterpiece it was beyond the predictability of needing a sequel. But once again know-it-all executives chose the easy way, milking the success of a beloved animated movie and making an ersatz of a sequel. 13 years after. It's all about the numbers, right? Well here's a number: 10. 10 reasons why the film sucked.1. Saccharine overdose, I expect many cutesy elements in a Disney Pixar movie, it first started with the babyish version of Dory, with those big eyes meant to make hearts melt and then she opened her mouth and I could have sworn the casting agents auditioned thousands of kids to find which one would have the cutest voice ever. Yes, she was adorable but it was like a doctor telling me to open my mouth and 'say aaaaaaaw'.2. The action starts too quickly, a random school trip on mister Ray's back, a random Dory's intrusion, and a random flashback and pop goes the Dory. 'Finding Dory' was trying to create an emotional connection between the opening scene and the adult Dory but it felt just too rushed, it's not like we've seen Dory longing for her lost parents before, she just happens to remember she had parents. 3. You don't base the plots on comic reliefs, there was a reason why the short-term memory loss was used for Dory, it was a defining character's trait but also a running gag, here it structures the plot and makes it dependent on Dory's flashes of memories coming at the most conveniently possible time, just when she's in a false track or a dead end, there's something that pushes her on the road again. The first movie was following a simple trajectory, and was dependent on a few encounters and obstacles, here it's all about hazardous contrivances and twists of luck.4. The film is about Dory trying to find her parents, the title makes a little sense although it was the only possible one establishing a continuity with the first film. The problem is that the title basically establishes the story from Marlin and Nemo's perspective and they're secondary characters, in fact, they're as 'pivotal' as Indiana Jones in 'Raiders', we understand their presence but they're also here to show that the animators didn't believe Dory alone was capable to carry a whole movie. They were right, we needed the pairs of clown fishes as the straight ones, oh the irony!5. Too much repetition, of course it's inevitable if your main character is suffering from short-term memory loss but how many times did she needed to mention it, how many times did we need to see an excited and happy Dory just going all tail ahead. She was a lovable buffoon in the first, hysterical in a good way, now she's hysterical in the worst possible way. Everything that made the first film genuinely funny became rapidly annoying here and don't get me started on the whale speak.6. Caricatured characterization, try to say that quickly. It seems pretty obvious for Dory, but how about Marlin? Basically, he's learned nothing from the first film, and he's still acting like a paranoid over-protective sad sack, not only that, but he says perhaps the most terrible thing to Dory without immediately apologizing, following the idiot plot where anything can be solved if the right words are said.7. Too much time spent above the water,. I don't mind a fish going from an ocean to a tank, but this trip was a bit far-fetched even for a movie that features a fish that can read. The problem is that the first Nemo started with a shocker, but if the very rules of that sequel applied in the first film, the Barracuda or the dentist's fish tank wouldn't have caused much trouble. In a universe where a fish can talk to a sea-lion, travel on a crazy seagull, or when an octopus can easily vanish from sight like a chameleon, any thing is possible. These are not the rules 'Finding Nemo' was based on.
Which leads me to that infamous car chase, Fonzie jumped the sharks, Dory jumped the truck... it's the same ruining effect. It's not enough that it's possibly the most overused climactic sequence in an action-packed movie, they had to indulge to it an a supposedly aquatic adventure. How about going for the emotional climax, how about actually making a good use of the aquatic park setting... how about not making the damn thing. 8. Indeed, was that trip necessary? Have we ever felt that there something in Dory's arc waiting to be closed. It is usual for animated sequels to focus on a character's background or on the secondary character, it worked with Buzz Lightyear for 'Toy Story 2' but that's because there was good material in it. 'DreamWorks' also came up with great secondary stories in the 'Shrek' or 'Kung Fu Panda' series, but Dory is just another-character-looking-for-her-parents with memory losses as a twist. It's a rather thin premise if you asked me. And you can tell they're trying to fatten it with the usual 'anything is possible' lesson.9. What's with that musical schmaltz titled 'Unforgettable' did they try to pull a 'Skyfall' or what? The song was so James Bond-esque I expected to see a woman's silhouette swimming in the ocean. What a shameful Oscar-bait, the film didn't get any nominations and there's a good reason for that.10. It wasn't that funny, yeah, yeah, Sigourney Weaver was funny the first time and then got overused, in the French version, they even dubbed it with a famous anchorwoman, which didn't make sense, once again the star system is killing the film... I guess every country will have a famous national voice. the first film was about 'Finding Nemo', the second has no reason to exist, except for 'Finding Money'.",6,0,1,22 December 2017
Stalag 17," What happens in the 'Stalag' stays in the 'Stalag'... or does it?
","A narrator with a slight stammer (Gil Stratton) introduces the film by saying that no war movie ever tackled prisoners of war (aka POW). Objection, your honor, how about Jean Renoir's 'Grand Illusion'? Granted there was no significant American POW film at the time but surely Billy Wilder must have heard about a French movie nominated for Best Picture in 1939, he must have heard a few anecdotes from Erich Von Stroheim during the shooting of 'Sunset Blvd. So, is the lie deliberate or not?I think Wilder didn't feel he was telling the same story, and that 'lie' is very revealing about the spirit of 'Stalag 17': it tries to fool us but in such an obviously fraudulent way that it doesn't fool us, as if there was a joke somewhere but not on us. And I think that very lie captures the spirit of the film, it is cynical but deliberately deceptive about the human nature, to the point that sergeant Sefton's farewell line about pretending to have never met might have been a genuine statement. Yet it ended with a friendly gesture just to keep the right amount of ambiguity. And God, is this film ambiguous!In many ways, 'Stalag 17' could have been an Americanization of 'Grand Illusion' with WW2 as the setting, and I guess that's the accomplishment made by 'The Bridge on the River Kwai' also starring William Holden, the bonding between the Japanese commandant and the British officer echoed the friendship between the two aristocrats in 'Illusion'. 'Stalag 17' was adapted from a play written by 'Stalag' survivors Donald Bevan and Edmun Trczinski, where what happens in the Stalag stays in the Stalag ... or does it? The main drama consists of finding out the identity of the stoolie who warned the Germans about the upcoming escape of two prisoners, causing them to do escape but inside coffins. As Camp Commandant Oberst von Scherbach (Otto Preminger) observed with a proud smirk: 'No one escaped Stalag 17. Not alive anyway'. It's interesting the way these deaths are handled. While the gravitas of the moment is heavily marked in the faces of the prisoners, especially Duke (Neville Brand) who spends the whole time with the expression of someone who wished he got Holden's part, William Holden's Sefton is proudly collecting the cigarettes he got from a bet against their lives. The two sacrificed lambs are only cinematic props to warn us about the presence of a traitor and to tell us that first-billed Holden is the number one suspect (aka the hero).Once you get that the dead prisoners represent drama and that they're handled in a lighthearted way (the narrator even leaves a joke at their departure), you get the point of 'Stalag 17', less a lighthearted drama than a serious comedy. And at that point of the review, I have to mention the two comic reliefs: Robert Strauss as Stanislaw 'the Animal' Kusawa and Harry 'Sugar-Lips' Shapiro (Harvey Lembeck), these two goofs crystallize the appreciation of the film, fans love it because they make the film feel like 'Animal House' in a POW Camp and the haters hate it for the same reason. Speaking for myself, I thought their comedic routine was overplayed at first but then I processed the tonality of the film in my head and figured out they needed to provide more meat for the story and give us a few comical interludes with the Russian prisoners, the raw eggs, the 'At ease!' moment and the 'Betty Grable' dance, until the unforgettable 'When Johnnie Comes Marching Home Again' where they're so busy dancing and marching they can't notice the spy quietly delivering a message in the 'mailbox'. We're definitely not stupid, they are.'There are only two guys who know I didn't do it. Me and the guy who did it'. Basically these two are also the only sane and reasonable people, though Sefton could have toned down his enthusiasm at the midst of the whole suspicion-ambiance and the traitor could have kept the incriminating piece out of his pocket, but nonetheless, the characters of Holden and a young Peter Graves managed to prevent the film to fall into the muddy trap of a nonsensical farce. There came a point where the last thrills came from the rat's race and the film needed one or two confrontations to spice it up. Humor and comedy can be great but with a right amount. As Schulz said 'one fuerher is enough'.The film was released at the end of the Korean War and the peak of the McCarthysm and some found in Sefton's accusation an illustration of the Jews' persecution and the HUAC-related paranoia, I think there's something more relevant within its tone (not the content), somethiung about the disillusion of men who're entrapped in their own condition and become easy preys for foolishness, and they just need a culprit to shoot first and think after, I get 'Stalag 17' works a little like 'M*A*S*H' a movie that handles war in such a goofy way it contains a few bits of subversion but doesn't keep you quite at ease.Holden won the Oscar while believing it had to go to either Lancaster or Clift who played in a more 'serious' picture as if he saw something of a fraud in 'Stalag 17'. Maybe it's a fraud, maybe it needed less ambivalence and that's why its follow-up 'Hogan's Heroes' worked better because it was plain comedy, but this is a film that tells us one thing, no one can fool you without your consenting, and the only guy who wasn't fooled was cynical but had smartened up, patriotism is one thing but keep smart is a nice advice and modern for its taste. 'Stalag 17' might be more brilliant than it seems, for such a classic prison escape movie, there are many aspects that escaped me, I reckon that.",8,1,1,19 August 2018
The Blind Side," The Blind Side is how Political Correctness can blind one's judgment...
","Wow, can you imagine the nerve of John lee Hancock! How dare he portrays a family of good Christians, of wealthy people without any problems and expressing a strange and mutual feeling called love! Can you believe there's also a big African-American kid from an impoverished neighborhood, abandoned by a drug-addicted mother... only to be saved by the knights in white shining armor! And don't get me started on the sappy, schmaltzy, happy ending where they're all celebrating his entry In National Football League.
Well, it's all based on a true story! But still, to pile up so many insults to political correctness and combine them into one movie!!! Now, I'll stop the rant. In case you hadn't noticed, I was being sarcastic. Now, let's be serious and consider what 'The Blind Side' is truly about.There are two ways to look at the sports biopic: a succession of clichés serving the images of good white savior, and giving a subtle unnoticeable flavor to the infamous 'Uncle Tom' (some even felt Magical White Negro vibes in the performance of Quinton Arron as Michael Oher) OR you can just enjoy it as a touching movie praising values like love and family, and showing that sometimes, it's not about the ethnic background but the level of violence you've been raised within and that inevitably condition your chances of a successful life. In other words, the rich socialite Leigh Anne Tuohydidn't adopt Mike because he was black, but because he was cold, hungry and in clear need for help. His ethnic race had no more relevance than his size.Speaking of his size, many viewers have criticized the prospect of making him play football, but this isn't an aspect where the Tuohy family had a role to play. The football premise is set-up when one of his friend's father introduces him to the football coach of Wingate Christian school Burt Cotton (Ray McKinnon), the coach is impressed by his size but 'Big Mike' can't enter the team without good semesters' grades. It's during his struggle to find a way with studies that his life path leads to an encounter with Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock). She didn't use him to satisfy some football- related ambitions but let's just be fair and accept that the guy was also born to play football, if not for his size, but for his wonderful protective instinct. Not to mention that he found something to do with his life and that brought joy to thousands of fans.So give the film a break, it's just about the way loving and caring determine one's path. Take two singers with equal talents, Celine Dion and Whitney Houston, look at the two men of their lives and how each singer ended, it has nothing to do with race, Houston might have had more talent than Dion but her life partner was trash and look how it ended up affecting her, Dion could count on the indivisible love of her husband René.That's all. The whole 'Blind Side' story revolves around the importance of family and love as drivers, even religion is as secondary as race, it is cleverly used as the 'marketing' asset behind Mike's recruiting but the film doesn't try to make 'market' it. I'm not surprised by the critics though but they should really pass over people's heads. Quinton Aaron was also criticized but he stroke me more as someone with a capability to listen and whose first reaction after a gesture of love was to be surprised by it because he's not used to. But he doesn't refuse a gesture of love, he smiles and nods. Many times, I expect the film to play the cynical card or inject some conflict but I loved how smoothly it went, how everyone in that family respected and loved Mike, even Lily Collins didn't play the awkward or jealous teenager but was rather sweet and open-minded. Well, little SJ (Jea Head) got on my nerves a few times, but I loved how he negotiated with all the football coaches, the kid meant business! And finally, there's Sandra Bullock in her Oscar-winning role.What I liked about her performance is the way she never overplays it, it could almost pass as a one-note performance until you get the idea that this is woman who must maintain a facade of cold formality and yet finds the proper way to communicate her feelings toward a kid with a totally opposite background, but that's her power, she knows exactly what language to speak and put some people in their place, she's really one cool mom.It's a good comedic role and very entertaining, which makes the more dramatic moments powerfully resonant.There comes a point where the film questions the motives of Leigh Anna and allows Mike to have a rebellious moment, but if you know the real history, you won't be surprised that it's a feel-good movie, which is quite rare from movies that are not comedies. It's a good old traditional family picture that can be enjoyed on a second watching and a third, it it somewhat superficial but not in a bad away, the film doesn't just try to be some grandstanding hymn to tolerance but keeps it simple and straight and humorous.The film was also nominated for Best picture, its second nomination, forcing the Academy to revise their criteria, it was in 2009 and I still remember how surprising the line up was, but retrospectively, there's something Best Picturesque about 'The Blind Side', once you decide to cut the PC vision and look at it for what is is, a nice and tender family movie, touching, heart-warming and funny.So let's not be blinded by the whole PC conspiracy agenda.",8,0,2,22 December 2017
The Shawshank Redemption," A Powerful Story of Courage, Perseverance and Friendship ...
","I will never forget the first time I watched 'The Shawshank Redemption', with my father. Both of us were fans of prison and male-bonding movies, and choose the film only expecting to watch a solid drama. Needless to say that, when the last line was delivered and the TV screen painted the walls with a beautiful blue, the feeling that we had just watched something exceptional instantly cut through our hearts, and before the second viewing, we would regularly mention how great that film 'with the poster' was.Then I would never miss it whenever I found it on TV, and after each viewing, it unveiled one unsuspected element of its unique appeal. I guess if it doesn't justify, at least it explains why this movie that didn't do well in the theaters, had a better success on VHS, TV and DVD before it would ultimately dethrone 'The Godfather' from the first place on IMDb Top 250. And it's only justice if 'The Shawshank Redemption', the least spectacular of the four Best Picture nominees in the glorious 1994, made by a relatively unknown director, a movie with an appeasing and appealing patience, took its time to grow on people and did it pretty well, as if it applied its own philosophy, patiently but determinedly. This is the strength of 'The Shawshank Redemption', its ability to tell a story that spans a long period of time without trying to get to the so-called essential, the simplest things take their full meanings, the smallest details have their share of importance. And think about it, in a prison where everyone wears the same outfits, where the days are regulated by the same routine, all you can do is to make a life out of this routine, make a place, to get closer to your own definition of 'having a life'. And as we penetrate the impressive walls of Shawshank, from the first vertiginous panoramic shot, we're literally submerged by the solemn austerity of the location, conveying a very hostile feel. These characteristics are perfectly incarnated by the figure of the Warden Samuel Norton, who's like the male alter-ego of Nurse Ratched from 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'. And the comparison with Forman's film isn't fortuitous as Shawshank intends to domesticate its occupants to the same limits of mechanical alienation, to the point that the only thing left to the inmates is to control their only valuable treasure: time, by getting busy, finding their own reason-to-be, like the veteran Brooks (James Whitmore) was the man with the books, Red, remarkably played by Morgan Freeman, was the man who could get you things.In a very intelligent move from the script, the hero of the film, the laconic Andy Dufresne, an upper-class banker, played in all nuance by Tim Robbins, is condemned to a life sentence at Shawshank, for the murder of his wife and her lover. And nothing indicates if he is innocent or guilty and I wondered if any certitude would have conditioned my appreciation of the character. I think it was necessary for us to have a reasonable doubt about his innocence in order to let his character progressively grow on us until we believe by ourselves that he was indeed the victim of unfortunate circumstances, the same feeling that grew in the heart of Red before becoming his best friend. Morgan Freeman is the pillar of the film while Tim Robbins is its free spirit, both allow us in a remarkable complementarity to dream of abstract notions like hope and freedom while being practical and 'busy' in the same time. And again, their friendship is a slow process that takes its time to progress and reaches a pivotal point when Andy was allowed to put his banker's casket again and feels that prison didn't deprive him from his 'social quality'. Shawshank is not slow but more a patience-demanding film with a sense of decency in the way it trusts our intelligence. And the film's motto, on which relies its philosophical core is 'Get busy living or get busy dying'. Now, two things occur to me while writing these lines, a heart-breaking sequence about the inmate Brooks who was freed after 50 years of detention, and who realized he was institutionalized. A notion explained by Red: when the infamous wall that scared you so much becomes your personal guiding light while outside, it's all dark and your time is deconstructed. Brooks couldn't live outside Shawshank so there was no other way he could live. The second thing is the sad passing of Steve Jobs today. And as I was reading his famous Stanford speech, I couldn't help but make a connection with the beautiful message of Darabont's film, an invitation to dream, to escape from any sort of walls or obstacles put in your life and heart with as many dreams as you can fulfill, a notion illustrated by the beautiful scene when Andy put some classical music on the microphone, so the prisoners could for once elevate themselves and having an ephemeral moment of pure freedom, this is the triumph of human spirit, this understanding of the value of life is 'The Shawshank Redemption'In the same vein than 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest', 'Shawshank' is a constant encouragement to fight the system and use time for the best, for whatever constitutes our dreams, being men again, able to enjoy, to feel, to give a meaning to our lives. In other words, hope, hope that things can get better despite the adversity. To quote Steve Jobs : 'Courage is the discovery that you may not win, and trying when you know you can lose.' This is the true intelligence of life, what makes it worth living.'The Shawshank Redemption' a powerful adaptation of Stephen King's novel is one of the greatest American films: a powerful story of courage, perseverance, hope and ultimately, friendship and humanity.",10,4,6,6 October 2011
Parasite," Smells Like Poor Spirit...
","For reviewers, universally-acclaimed and awards-sweeping movies call for immediate viewings and reactions, whether along the enthusiastic stream, or the other way (the eagerness to express a dislike being even greater). With Boon Jong Ho's 'Parasite', I wanted to write a review as soon as I finished it.But I was puzzled by that bloody climax. The last South Korean masterpiece I saw was 'Old Boy' and if I was riveted by the story, the violence disturbed me no matter how relevant to the plot it was. Now, I didn't expect that film that started like a fun comedy of errors leaning toward screwball to generate such a hyperbolic outburst of violence. It wasn't even black comedy but straight out drama. I wasn't sure I liked it, but I wasn't sure I hated it either. I guess I had to sleep on it and figure out what Boon Jong Ho was telling us. So, here's my personal take, and apologies if I don't mention the actors' names, with the exception of the father played by Song Kang Ho.First of all, this is not a spoiler-free review, which allows me to get right to the point.Having digested the film now, I realized that Boon Jong Ho didn't make a comedy at all, which makes senses. I don't think the film would have won the Golden Palm or the Best Picture or all these awards if it was a cute comedy of a family of con-artists. Of course, the film Is encrusted with many humorous bits but so was Jordan Peele's 'Get Out', a film less celebrated for its humor than its sharp blow against white liberals. Retrospectively, I find it obvious that the director and screenwriter was preparing us to a fatal clash between the classes, but I didn't expect it the catalyst, and film's leitmotif, to be something as trivial as 'smell'. You read me.There are three key scenes in my opinion that build up to the final rage that will lead the father to kill his boss, despite the total absence of enmity between them.1/ 'They have the same smell': we've come to the comical momentum where every member of the 'poor' family got a job in the rich property. They're all fitting in the family, appreciated for their work and yet it's the little kid who smells something 'fishy' in the way that they all smell the same. Bong Joon Ho doesn't treat it as the hint that there's something fishy about them (which a lesser director would do) but that they live in the same ramshackle house with all the street and fried onions stink sticking to their clothes. They smell because they smell like poor people. The smell symbolically blows their cover.2/ The hidden-under-the-table scene: what could have been used as a slapstick moment gives more depth to two key characters: the fathers. Laying on the sofa, snuggling with his wife and watching his son outside in the teepee, the rich father compliments his driver's work but laments about his terrible smell. Notice that the comment is paralleled with another one about him knowing how to stay in his place. Also notice the father's reaction, he realizes that he's not just a man or a valuable employee, he's got the smell in the package of appreciation. Notice that the comment is said in secrecy during an intimate moment because in real-life, we never tell anyone about his smell, only a child can be that careless. But the father's comment resonated like an indisputable verdict, one that reduced the father (and automatically his family) to their poor and stinky background, like the untouchables in India. Speaking of India, the scene is followed by a huge flood in the lowers streets... that feature the third key scene.3/ One last cigarette: while everyone is trying to save whatever valuable hasn't been taken by the waters, the daughter rushes to the toilet where huge sewage cascades are propelled from the bowl, spilling all over her body. Without minding the foulness, she just sits down and savors one last cigarette. We realize how familiar to the low depths these people are, that smelling anything is barely an issue. They don't like it, they just don't have the luxury of caring, but from the rich ones' perspectives, people who don't mind the stink, stink physically, and then symbolically.So, no matter how friendly the relationships are, they clash each other on that iron curtain made of streets, sewage, gasoil or cooking fragrances and bourgeois hypocrisy. Which all naturally leads up to that moment where having just seen his daughter stabbed to death, the father must give the car keys to his boss to take his boy to emergency. The keys lay under a dead man's body and the rich father is repulsed by his smell; one time too many. The poor father who should be angry toward that man who took his daughter's life, directs instead his anger toward his boss, tracing an ironic line of solidarity with the killer... because he knew the hardship he went through inthat bunker and the respect he showed to the house master only to be reduced to a smell, him too.If there's one movie that shows in powerful symbolism the battle of classes, it's 'Parasite' and the mood whiplash at the final act was like the detonation of a talent. Boon Jong Ho proves that Asian cinema is one to rely on, an Art that tells inventive stories and make them insightful and relevant and entertaining. It also reminded me of my criticism of former Asian Golden Palm winner 'The Eel', where I wished the film left the bloody scene as a climactic flashback. Blood is a big narrative expense and should be left to the right moment to implode its meaningful or cathartic power.I was puzzled first but once I got that leitmotif, I could see the genius.",10,8,11,10 March 2020
Rango," Rango is a Bingo...
","Ever since my eyes met the poster of 'Rango', this film never stopped to tickle my curiosity. I made a poll about scariest looking not-meant-to-be-scary posters and 'Rango' seemed like a good candidate, but it made me wonder: how on Earth could such an ugly-looking creature be ever conceived as a major animated protagonist? Rango is not 'Shrek ugly', Shrek is monstrous in a cinematically appealing way, but Rango looks like a chameleon and I don't think these animals would make it in the Top 20 bestial beauty pageants, even by Disney standards, a chameleon IS ugly.But then again, why shouldn't a chameleon be the hero? Why should the requirements of drawings affect the narrative status, and as a matter of fact, what it is with the whole reptilian universe's snubbing, aren't we tired of cute, fluffy bunnies and proud and majestic horses? One of the good things about 'Rango', and there are plenty, is that the film redeems a whole fauna that has been severely overlooked by animation: the creatures from the desert. The setting is a town named Dirt and its populated by the flotsam and jetsam of bestial society: toads, rats, lizards, bats, turtles and beavers, even the rodents are drawn in the ugliest possible way, but these are the animals who fought the hard way for survival, centuries and centuries of evolution, but in 'human timing', it fits the Conquest of the West period. And what better a setting than the desert for a great Western story?And if 'Rango' is all built on Western archetypes and some from other genres (and that includes one of the best takes on 'Apocalypse Now') these references aren't the end but only the means, it's all in the story. And this is why I'm glad I finally watched 'Rango' because I never really put my finger in what left me perplex in 'A Shark Tale', and now I got it, it's one thing to make references to countless movies and the more of a movie lover you are, the more likely to enjoy them you are but here, no reference feels gratuitous and it's always combined with a bit of originality that belongs to the film. 'Rango' has a story to tell, it takes it seriously enough to get pretty dark and handle such serious themes like death, thirst and progress and it knows how to loosen up when needed to. In other words, it's adult material; I doubt the film would appeal to little children, but this is finally a movie that aims the adult world in an intelligent and fun.Starting with Rango, that little guy is one of these original creations that immediately grow in you, a chameleon who is a hero in his own world, he rehearses it with a headless naked Barbie doll, a dead cockroach and a mechanical fish but the heart isn't in it, he know what lacks: conflict, a pivotal moment, a journey starter. Basically, Rango anticipates his heroic status, he's like the voice of his own writers, his voice-actor, Johnny Depp and his 'Caribbean Pirates' director Gore Verbinski. He is an obvious creation, and the presence of the singing owls as a Greek chorus reinforced the artificiality of Rango. But when the action takes off, when an armadillo crosses the road, and the tank where Rango lived get out of his owners' speeding car, Rango is thrown on the road, gets out of the comfort zone but gets 'in the picture' and becomes his own creation, the journey begins and things start to get fun.The armadillo shows him the way where he can meet his destiny, the West so Rango moves forward, he meets a hawk, a toad, a bottle of coke and finally, a cute female lizard named Beans, whose particularity is to freeze like a defensive move. But she's more than the soon-to-be love interest. The film plays with archetypes but never without substance. Take the great saloon entrance, Rango is eager to make an impression, he then brags about how he killed seven outlaws with one bullet while everyone listens with admiration, he is hilarious not just by the speech he makes but the enthusiasm form his listeners. Every character in this film has something to say, in most animated films, you have the protagonists and the rest are just space fillers with occasional one-liners, in 'Rango', you feel like each one's story would have made as good a film.So 'Rango' becomes the sheriff, and the plot gets more surprisingly thicker and complex with a scheme you wouldn't see coming, let's just say that it involves water and the antagonist is obviously based on Noah Cross from 'Chinatown'. Out of all the movies parodied in animated features, this is the last I would have expected, and when the Mayor says that he uses water to buy 'the future', I didn't even think of Chinatown, I was drawn out by the film, and I was wondering why is it that Tarantino gets screenplays nominations for a thing like 'Django Unchaines' and a film like 'Rango' gets none. Well, it still won the Best Animated Feature Oscar and rightfully so.But I wonder if it would have won over the 2010 Disney films or in 2012, this is obviously a film that is 100% original which is more than you can say about Disney and Dreamworks, and it's a film that stands so high above the usual movies for kiddies that it deserves a special spot as the most original cartoon and the riskiest. Indeed, you can't even merchandise 'Rango', and that's why I love about it, it's a film whose priority was to have a unique look and feel. In the end, it is a unique film.",10,0,1,14 October 2016
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Emotionally Volatile and Bizarre Masterpiece...
","Either 'Birdman' is too simple but tries to make its nervous directing and real-time editing pass for intellectual complexity or if it really flies over these considerations with the insolent confidence of a real birdman. Well, I'm not sure the film is as original as it intended to be, but the treatment is one of a kind and maybe one of these cases where the form and the content redeem each other and contribute to one of these puzzling experiences that look too good not to be intentionally made to impress you, yet the result is so efficient that you almost feel guilty to fall for it.Again, Inarritu displays some infuriating wizardry, using long takes and transitions from scene to scene, that are nonexistent so that in the end, you have the confusing impression to have endured in less than two hours, a dizzying and mind-bending three-day journey swinging between arguments, confessions, improvisations, outbursts of anger, passions, feelings, reconciliations etc. It is noisy, talkative, the drum beats popping up here and there highlight the torments that can invade an individual's mind like so many hits in the head, but, say what you want about 'Birdman', the movie is alive and full of characters with a purpose that goes beyond the simple story-line. Well theoretically, they're all present for the release of an adaptation of Raymond Carver's play, but they're also free electrons moved by their own instinct, pasts and personal issues.They all have a particular endeavor and they're all tormented enough to pull the blanket in their side when they feel the need. The result is confusing but somewhat exhilarating and that everyone stays dedicated to the play allows the film to keep its common thread, so this mess has a reason to be, and to happen. And there's the central pillar, Michael Keaton as Riggan Thompson: the has-been star. Riggan is an alter-ego of Keaton that fools no one, Keaton ensured the transition between the 80's and 90's with his portrayal of Batman, but only to sink into relative oblivion after Burton's 'Batman' movies have been relegated to the status of their corny 60's counterpart by Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale. This is not just Riggan but Keaton's comeback and the similarities are so vivid that the performance was probably harder, because it really takes courage to laugh at yourself.Thankfully, the film isn't devoid from a sense of humor in its constant meta-referential take on showbiz; even actors find the strength to laugh at themselves, like Edward Norton playing Mike Shiner, a very difficult and volatile method actor who's a ticking bomb of unpredictability. Besides Mike Shiner, there's Riggan's daughter, Sam (Emma Stone) who just came from rehab and tries to rebuild her relationship with her Dad, there's his ex-wife (Amy Ryan), a Broadway debutante (Naomi Watts) and the manager (Zach Galifianakis), all these people gravitate around Riggan, who's like the ringmaster and the player of his own bizarre show, trying to find himself while he's not even sure to be worth whatever his conception is, constantly invaded by the voice of 'Birdman', like a phoenix awaiting to resurrect from the ashes of the past. The conflict is between Riggan's past and future and structures the film's present made of an attempt to conquer pride and self-esteem.And it's quite impressive that, in this existential swirl, the film had time to make parallels between Riggan's struggles and the obsessions of going viral, dictated by society and affecting the youth. Speaking of celebrities, there is an important scene, Riggan meets respected critic Tabitha Dickinson (Lindsay Duncan) who's like a theater 'Pauline Kael', she doesn't take him as an actor but a celebrity, a media phenomenon, a fraud who tries to steal some prestige, he tells her that all she does is labeling things, giving sterile epithets to hide out the fact that she didn't nothing in her life, they're both part of the same hypocrisy but no one deserves resentment who tries at least to stake his life and do something about it, any Youtube commentator could get a taste of Riggan's rant. Yet these comments are relevant because everyone seeks approval and popularity.I guess what 'Birdman' shows is that we're all driven by opposite forces, one that tells you what you're really worth, or that you're a God, or a bum, it's all about perceived, real and felt value, and how we can express any of them. The film is an eye-opening experience about people's inner needs to be accepted, but it's more about reaching the kind of state where a man can master his being and control himself in order to accomplish what he feels he's meant to do. Maybe unconsciously, but it borrows a lot from another stage-themed film about aging, John Cassavetes' underrated 'Opening Night' where Gena Rowlands played a character in conflict with her self-perception and yet wanted to make her performance worthwhile for the audience as if the people in the theater were the incarnation of life. There might that idea that there's something in theater that encompasses life, as there are many moments where the line between reality and fantasy gets confusingly thin..Were these bits pretentious? Well, I don't think one's work wouldn't reflect part of his ego and maybe what we take from pretentiousness is the strong presence of a man's personal vision in his work. In that case, this is a real masterwork, and a dazzling drum-beat driven journey that feels like a good companion to 'Whiplash', a co-nominee of the same year. 'Birdman' took the Oscar home, maybe because it wasn't as linear as 'Whiplash', it tried to go beyond the limits of imagination, or because it fooled the Academy, but maybe the talent it takes to fool the audience deserves an Oscar after all, maybe, it's all about fooling people as long as you don't make them look like fools.",9,1,3,8 May 2017
The Big Short," The Trades of Wrath...
","A few days ago, my wife told me that the French President, who made finance his personal enemy in election days had just voted a law, making people losing all their money if their bank were out of business, no one knew that, it was during summer. But she knew, she works in a bank. And God after watching 'The Big Short', I'm not the least surprised. When will people understand how the game works, dammit? 'It ain't what you don't know that gets you into trouble. It's what you know for sure that just ain't so.'As much as I like this Twain quote, I wish they used instead ''A banker is a fellow who lends you his umbrella when the sun is shining, but wants it back the minute it begins to rain.' The greatness of Adam McKay's biographical tragicomedy (tragedy emphasized) lies in its pedagogical value: with fourth-wall breaking, a dense but easily-digestible script (co-written with Charles Randolph) and brilliant cameos explaining the complex intricacies of the credit system, you quickly catch the drift. The umbrella metaphor would've been one of these images that speak thousand words. And on that level, the collapse of the housing market in 2008 isn't exactly a 'Gene Kelly' rain, more of 'Noah's ark' one.The film, like an ominous ticking bomb, chronicles the chain of events leading to the disaster, just like 'Titanic', we know the end but the dynamite-editing makes the experience so exhilarating. It's like 'Crisis for Dummies', the dummies we were for trusting our bankers more than our intelligence. How a credit works, where your money goes, and how you fill the portfolio of poker-face crooks who know how to make a delicious stew out of rotten fish heads.Cheating is such a part of the game that the question is not 'how did that happen?', but 'how could that 'NOT' happen? The very premise of credit is fallacious when you think about it (and this comes from someone who's still paying his studies loan debts after 14 years). The greatest trick of the credit system is to make you believe that you can buy something you actually can't. And this is why sub-prime loans (high risks for fewer returns, worthless mortgages making as worthless bonds) have been created, this is the butterfly's fart that will end up in a hurricane, and hedge fund manager Michael Burry( (Christian Bale) smelled the fart before everyone else.Burry checks a few lines and columns on Excel, and decides to 'short the bond', meaning to bet against the housing market by creating a credit default swap market. Let's just say, it's like investing on pharmaceuticals when you're the only one who knows about the imminence of a bacterial war. Many banks accept his offer, which implies that he'll hit the jackpot only in the (then unconceivable) case that the housing market collapses. It's one of these cases where even Bale can betray in his eyes, the one that works anyway, something like 'I wish I was wrong', and he's not the only one who feels this way.There's Mark Baum, another hedge manager who's alerted by a trader played by Ryan Gosling about Burry's move. They can see the sword of Damocles over their heads and do their own investigations, from estate agents bragging about their exploits: selling expensive houses to poor schmucks or Standards & Poors selling lousy debt obligation with excellent ratings (law of the market), they know there's something fishy. Meanwhile, two young investors (John Magaro and Finn Wittrock) learn about the situation and with the help of a retired banker, played by Brad Pitt, they go to Mortgage Securities Forum in Las Vegas and make enough deals to be able to buy out the same 'insurance' than Burry, they're on the safe side.And this is when Pitt's character interrupts their celebration by reminding them, that lives will be lost at each percentage of unemployment rising, and that there's nothing to be joyful about. And that's what makes 'The Big Short' such a magnificent storyteller. Just when you get an overdose of financial jargon, you have Margot Robbie in a bathtub explaining to you the mortgage system (the script should win the Oscar just for that), just when you wonder what has become of this character, you get to him, and just when the comedic tones gets too palpable, you have a moment of genuine decency reminding you that that the film is the chronicle of a predicted tragedy.There's a similar moment where Mark Baum discusses with a businessman who created synthetic CDOs, increasingly large bets on faulty loan brilliantly explained by Selena Gomez who plays a black jack player inspiring many viewers to bet for her on the basis that she had won every time. She'd lose ultimately but it's one thing to lose five thousands on a risk that cost you five thousands, but when financial tricks turns the five thousand into millions, in terms of massive destructive weapons, these CDOs are the real stuff, and Baum knows the bomb is soon to explode. It's almost ironic that his name sounds like Boom.It makes sense that some cultures forbid interest rates on the basis that nothing should be bought above its intrinsic value. Metal has value, salt has value, but what value has paper than the numbers written on? Why should it take you 20 years to buy an apartment thrice its price? Because finance says '1$ today isn't 1$ tomorrow', I know, but well, whatever these billions were worth before the crisis, they totally vanished in 2008 putting millions of people jobless, homeless and many of them lifeless.'The Big Short' is an important movie with the epic ambition of Michael Moore's docs, the spellbinding editing of 'JFK' and the fast-paced entertainment of 'Goodfellas' except that this time, the gangsters are not arrested in the end.",9,3,5,14 February 2016
Platoon," War as a state of mind ...
","I hate quoting myself but as I said it before: 'the best war movies are about wars that were lost for defeat is the most revealing of the essence of war which already signs the defeat of reason, of civilization'. At one point, the central character of 'Platoon', Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen) says: 'I see hell as the impossibility of reason', war is indeed hell because it jeopardizes all your beliefs and all the values you stand for, and by the simple process of following orders in a blind patriotism, it leads men to their own principles' betrayal.And 'Platoon' powerfully conveys the terrifying aspect of war as more than a series of battles opposing two military forces, but as a conflict taking place in another arena of angst, pain and fear: the minds of young soldiers, literally torn apart. War as an inner dilemma, incarnated by two visions: one humanistic that can be perceived as pure suicidal crusading, another one, more realistic but that feels like a nihilistic escape. And the power of the film is to incarnate this duality through two characters, two actors who define two approaches to war: Sgt. Elias (Willem Dafoe) the humanistic; Sgt. Barnes (Tom Berenger) the realistic. Chris Taylor arrives in Vietnam with the innocence of a newborn baby and all his initiation will be driven by these two figures, as he says, he was 'raised by these two fathers'.'Platoon' shows the three different layers: the conventional Vietnam War, the 'civil war' within the platoon where half the 'grunts' follow Barnes and the other half, including Taylor, follows Elias, and ultimately, the war as a state of mind. The result is a nightmarish chaos where death can come from anywhere, it might as well be your enemy, and your comrade and even yourself the battles are rarely frontal, rather circular where each spot can reveal a deadly presence. Some soldiers can feel the presence of death, and this very pressure can either paralyze you when you see the enemy coming during an ambush or it can make you shoot at any directions. It can also make a solder snap and provoke the massacre of whole villages. Barnes is pushed to shoot a crying mother in the head, and reaches his breaking point at this very moment.The village massacre serves to show that in the name of so-called America's ideals, the soldiers killed, massacred and committed deeds that were no nobler than the ones they were supposed to fight. Oliver Stone doesn't condemn or glorify these actions, he only shows them with a gripping realism, showing is enough because it's further than where any other war movie went. It exorcises the inner demons of many Vietnam veterans who couldn't tell what they saw or what they did. It confronts America to its own actions; to the way the countries exploited poor soldiers for a war that wasn't worth it. Maybe the film betrays a hope in Oliver Stone's mind, that the film would encourage the younger generations to be able to use free will before fighting, and not to think that any war is worth to fight just because you owe it to your country.And Chris Taylor doesn't just incarnate the coming-of-age spirit of the film; he represents the proud American patriotism altered by reality. He volunteered because, like his grandpa fought in WWI, his father in WWII, he embodies the naive attitude that consists to think that any war is a fair war. That's the kind of sensitive nerve patriotism tries to touch, and that's why so many young America went to Iraq to fight because there were massive destruction weapons, and Saddam Hussein was linked to the September 11 attacks, shameful lies that ended up destroying a country. In the beginning, Taylor wants to discover these anonymous guys at the end of the barrel, who define the real America, some who'll make it, some who don't, but it's this camaraderie, this male bonding, this pride to serve the country that drives Taylor's heart. When he's there, he understands the meaning of hell, he understands why people are counting the days before relief, and more than anything he understands why they don't understand his volunteering.Lack of understanding, impossibility to reason, it's probably this disbelief that is forever immortalized by the shot of this dying soldier rising his arms through the air, trying to reach the unreachable In a country sparing of 'mea culpa', Oliver Stone had the guts to show the reality of the Vietnam War and its psychological affect on young people who started being idealistic before discovering how low can humanity fall in the name of so noble ideals. His next film 'Born on the Fourth of July' tackled the political aspect but 'Platoon' is a 100% war movie and an extraordinary psychological thriller as well supported by a magnificent cast of supporting characters (Forest Withaker, Terry Quinn, Kevin Dillon, Johnny Depp, Francesco Quinn, to name a few) and spectacular special effects and sounds. Oliver Stone is also part of the praise not only for the directing but also for the realism he drained from his own experience in Vietnam.Indeed, just like I thought 'Schindler's List' was better directed than 'The Pianist' but 'The Pianist' was a better told story because it was directed by a man who survived the holocaust, I would establish the same comparison with 'Apocalypse Now', 'Platoon' has a less epic scope, but it feels so personal that you know you couldn't get any closer to what the hell of the Vietnam war truly was, and that's what makes it one of the most accurate, thought-provoking and emotionally affecting war movies movie ever made, or simply one of the best.",10,2,3,9 November 2012
Paths of Glory," Starts like an Anti-War film, ends like a Humanistic masterpiece ...
","'I reject the war and everything in it ... I don't deplore it ... I don't resign myself to it ... I don't weep about it ... I just plain reject it and all its fighting men. I don't want anything to do with them or it. Even if there were nine hundred and ninety-five million of them and I were all alone, they'd still be wrong and I'd be right. Because I'm the one who knows what I want: I don't want to die.'--- Ferdinand Bardamu, admitting his absolute cowardice in the French literary masterpiece 'Journey to the End of the Night' by Louis-Ferdinand Celine. ----There's no possible anticipation of how our so precious ideals, nationalism, patriotism, and whatever abstractions ending with that detestable suffix, will inspire us at the crucial moment, when our chances of staying in one piece for the next minute will be severely compromised. For there is one thing for sure, no person in this world does want to die in the last moment before death, even in the case of suicides. Our conscience, works as a double-edged sword because we –contrarily to the animals- are aware of our mortal condition, and we all fear the unknown, except in the intimate conviction on the after-world's existence. The role displayed by religion in these circumstances is dangerous but crucial. Religion is like the accomplice of a cruel authority that decides to kill you, in the name of love. The general tells you why you should accept to kill, and the priest why you should accept to get killed.Love your country, love your God, and kill in the name of them, and don't fear being killed. This is the indecent games that politics and religions love to play. In making us believe that we belong to the right side and naturally omitting that the enemy uses the same psychological mechanisms, after all, there is no room for empathy when it comes to wars, all that matters is the sacred and sanctified 'path of glory', a beautiful road paved with the most hellish intentions. These sordid roles are played by two generals in the opening of Stanley Kubrick's movie, one is the master puppeteer, General Commander Broulard and his distinguished subordinate General Mireau, and the puppets submitted to a suicidal mission, have no objection to express, except obeying the orders. This is the war's philosophy, go ahead, run, jump for glory, but don't look back; you own rifles are pointing at you. You belong to the greatest country in the world, and that pride alone is enough to resign yourself and die as a hero.'Invoking posterity is like making speeches to worms', said again, the great Louis-Ferdinand Celine. Dying like a hero, being remembered, the glory of this, or that, all these words become senseless when you know that you'll be a rotten corpse soon. This is what war is about. War is organic, you feel it, you smell it, breath it, the nose drown in an ocean of dirty mud, and praying your divine power that it would be quick, while watching the guts of your friend splattering in your uniform or a strident gurgle piercing your ears. During the film, two soldiers discuss which death would be less painful, as each one examines the effect of a bayonet, gas or a gunshot in the body. Speak about torment, fear or anguish, we're scared because whatever we're taught in class, in catechism, in history, we're afraid to leave the Earth, because we're afraid to live our body. We don't care for the other, this is OUR country, but this is MY body, and it makes a whole lot difference in the Army when the individual doesn't count, one death is tragic, one thousand is statistics. In one scene, one of the three soldiers condemned for 'cowardice in the face of the enemy', envies the cockroach that'll still be alive on the day he'll be dead, his unfortunate companion stamps on the insect, to give him 'the edge' not realizing that he just 'killed to make a point', his own condition in microcosm.So, talk about courage, about heroism, these are such great words, but ultimately, while facing death, even the bravest man can collapse and bawl like a little girl. The moment where the supposedly toughest one begs for mercy, broke my heart as one of the most honest and truest depiction of the mental state of a man about to die  although I'm not in a rush to verify how it really feels. And this is humanity, an attachment to life, not a sadistic pleasure to kill the other in the name of your pride. War is the existential nightmare of humanity, and 'Paths of Glory' the greatest denunciation of its anti-humanistic nature, after 'All Quiet on the Western Front'. It's hard to imagine that the film was made by a director who wasn't in his thirties. Stanley Kubrick made one of the most virulent pamphlets against the madness of war that sent millions of people to the massacre, selling the prestige of winning the war, of fighting for the country like the body of a beautiful maiden. A strong reason for Colonel Dax, Kirk Douglas as the man who defended the three accused, to be ashamed for human race.Never had a movie be so just in its depiction of War, and I guess it needed a positive note to bring some light in the darkness. The unforgettable final scene in the bar, where a young German girl sings a famous song, and after the boos, the whistling, the soldiers hum the song in unison, is the highlight of the film, that proved that after all, we may be called cowards, pacifists, idealists, but when you overlook the futile barriers that poison our relationships, you realize that life is so precious it's worth being called a coward",10,3,6,25 July 2011
Back to the Future Part II," The way the 50's were ... the 80's were not ... the 2010's will not be ...
","Well, if it's not the best, this is certainly the most creatively wacky opus of the timeless time-classic trilogy  'Back to the Future Part II' has this particular merit that it takes the opportunity to make a sequel of a great classic and push its concept to the most extreme -yet scientifically acceptable- limit. Exactly how far you can go with time travel without repeating the plot of the first movie? Well, putting their efforts together, the two Bobs (Gale and Zemeckis) took a new trajectory with one parameter to take into account, the ending of the first movie and its iconic line 'Roads? Where we're going we don't need roads' until the De Lorean flashes its way to 2015 before the eyes of a speechless Biff Tannen.And 2015 is the problem with movies set in the future, their chances of unfortunate miscalculations get higher as we approach the crucial year. As there was no mission to Jupiter 10 years ago, in 4 years, we know there would be no Hover Board, no flying cars, not even auto-adjusting shoes and auto-drying jackets ... but seriously, what would you have expected from a comedy? The interest of 2015 was less to discover a nightmarish dystopia nightmare a la 'Soylent Green' than to REdiscover 'Hill Valley' REdesigned as a futuristic universe not supposed to be taken seriously  Zemeckis didn't expect to make a sequel, but considering the high popularity of the first opus, what was a just-for-laughs ending became the involuntary cliff-hanger to introduce the second film. Cars had to fly, and there had to be a mission in the future.And the first act set in the future might disappoint for this lack of nostalgia feel from the first film, and something maybe too forced or artificial. However, the script gets more interesting when we discover the future of the McFly, carrying much more serious undertones and I guess we accept the silly elements of the first act (Marty's kids looking like him, to name one) because the second and the third act kind of redeem it. I'll go even further by saying that the gap between the first act and the rest of the film is the only thing that prevented that one to be my favorite. This is the film that inspired my fascination for movies featuring time loops and the ripple effect, thanks to its terrific story about the exploitation of time travel, to have a second chance in life, like in the first film, but this time, for evil purposes. On that level, 'Back to the Future Part II' exploits the great villainous potential of Biff Tannen, who deals with our heroes every time  literally, demonstrating the limits of time travels when handled by the wrong persons. Marty realizing that he can take advantage of this little trip in the future saves the Gray Sport's Almanach  for 'his' future, and from that very point (that needed to be exploited in a time-travel film) a destructive ripple effect would create a new chain of events and ultimately, the infamous alternate 1985. As soon as Marty and Doc get back in that 'new' reality, there's the extraordinary hellish feeling of a world belonging to Biff Tannen. Honorable mention for Thomas F. Wilson who deserves more praises as the third important character of the trilogy, if only for the priceless scene when an older and wiser Biff finally corrects his younger alter ego's verbal idiocy.The Alternate 1985 is the emotional highlight of the film allowing us to breathe and meditate on the real dangers of time travels. And the icing on the cake is yet to come. After all, this is a sequel, sure, but think of one thing, why wouldn't you use time travel to revisit the same period from a new perspective? Remember the first opus when Marty got back in 1985 and witnessed a second time the dramatic 'killing' and how mislead he was by his déjà vu appearance. In 'Part II', the climactic confrontation takes place in the same time than the first one, Marty has a feeling he went there the day before, the funny thing is that he meant it as a figure of speech. And for our greatest delight, we live the same scenes from the new Marty's perspective. And the thrilling part is when the characters get so close that the risk of a paradox aren't to be neglected, and the smartness of the script strikes again by using elements from the first movies as plot devices. What a pleasure to live again classic punch in Biff's face and the 'Johnny B. Goode' moment getting two times more classic. 'Back to the Future Part II' is indeed one of the best sequels, because it obeys the very purpose of sequels, creating a feeling of deja vu with an original plot, making a film in the same vein as the first, if not with more heart, but with more gutsy creativity and the obligatory references that would become the trademarks of the trilogy, 'Mom is that you?' 'Great Scott', the newcomer 'Chicken!' revealing a new interesting facet in Marty's personality. And neither of the Bobs chickened out when at the end, they felt the movie still had some more potential, so instead of a convenient happy ending, as a flash of creativity, Doc aboard the DeLorean floating in the sky, is struck by lightning and disappears ... and one minute after, Marty receives a letter from a Western Union agent, a letter written by Dog 70 years before, and we realize that at that moment, we know the ropes of time travel, because we 'got' what happened.And what a better conclusion to re-watch the most iconic part of the trilogy when the DeLorean gets back to 1985 followed by the greatest cinematic cliff-hanger : a Marty McFly back FROM the future",9,2,3,4 October 2011
Carrie," A Landmark of the Horror Genre...
","The mark of great horror movies is to depict horror visually and tacitly, when the anticipation and the non-action make your heart pound more than any slashing. For all its abundance of hemoglobin, 'Brian de Palma's 'Carrie' is never as haunting and effective as when it deals with the brutality endured by its titular characters. For 'Carrie' is a deep and emotionally involving portrait of a tormented creature, whose power is finally, fully expressed when she's the victim of the 'one prank too many' at the moment that could have been the time of her life. Everyone knows the iconic picture of blood-soaked Sissy Spacek, but also her dazzling smile while holding flowers during her prom coronation, that's the duality of Carrie and the secret of her appeal.Through his breakthrough best-selling novel, Stephen King painted, in bold red letters, a much fascinating portrait of a shy, insecure girl like we all knew in high-school, an easy target for more confident, popular and (although not a rule) prettier girls. This is clearly established in the first shot where, after having missed a ball during volleyball game, she gets insulted and hit by her schoolmates. Looking at Sissy Spacek's innocent look, I felt an instant empathy toward that poor creature. I was bullied in school, athletics weren't my strongest suit, and while I wasn't as shy as Carrie, I was certainly below the line of popularity, so I knew all too well what she was going through.But Carrie is an even more excessive case, she doesn't even realize that she's having her first period during the following shower. That a girl so advanced in age didn't even anticipate her physiological changes is suspicious and worries Mrs. Collins, her comprehensive gym teacher who finds the right words and gesture to appease her panic attack. We start having a few glimpses of Carrie, when the principal misquotes her name; an ashtray starts shaking and then literally jumps when he shouts. A similar incident occurs when a kid teasing her falls from his bike, there's a sort of catch underneath Carrie's seemingly submissive personality. She's not your typical target. The film doesn't try to be a character study but works all the same.At home, Carrie's mother confronts her, she's a bigoted Christian played by a convincingly scary Piper Laurie. At the very knowledge that her daughter has the curse, Margaret throws a tantrum on her and asks her to pray God for forgiveness. She's a scary woman but she reveals a lot about Carrie especially that behind every weak personality, there's a controlling and dominant parent believing in his/her good intentions. Carrie's soul is the soul of her mother's obsessions, but it had such a traumatic effect on Carrie that it shaped the two defining aspects of her personality: shyness and a 'power' revealing itself to be 'telekinesis. In King's oeuvre, power is always at the hands of vulnerable people and that's why King's books and adaptations are so successful.But 'Carrie' also benefits from Brian De Palma's directing, flashy when it's called for to emphasize the suddenness of the scary outbursts with the use of Bernard Herrman's violin score from 'Psycho', but there is a fine balance between stylish moments and quieter ones. And on the basis of these moments where the teacher confronts the girls, when she helps Carrie to feel better and to take care of her face, for these touching interactions with Tommy, the prettiest guy in school, I liked 'Carrie'. This is not your typical 'all flash and no substance' horror movie, as no flashiness, no nudity, no extreme violence or sexuality ever feels gratuitous. Spacek makes Carrie so real the realism exceeds her fragile aura and affects the film, positively.And while De Palma paid a remarkable tribute to his master Hitchcock, there's a dimension of sweetness and romance that weren't known as Hitchcock's trademarks. So in its own right, this is great romance culminating at the prom. The dance sequence is nothing short but a masterpiece of filmmaking, a moment where Carrie still doesn't realize that this is happening, but Tommy finds the perfect words to reassure her. The camera turns around them and the pace accelerates until it gets vertiginous as if De Palma deliberately accentuated the dizziness of Carrie, as if she was intoxicated by her euphoria. It is just too good to be true, but as viewers, we want to believe it, and as long as it takes for Carrie to get on the stage, to smile, to see people smiling back, to receive the flowers, we savor every moment of that before it all gets downhill.This is one of these instances where you almost wish there would be no movie, for Carrie's sake. This is how powerfully and patiently our empathy was built and how the climax, as brutal and blindly violent as it was (many victims weren't even laughing at Carrie) shows that sometimes, violence is out of control, it starts when an innocent life is brutalized but as a consequence, many other innocent lives can be swept out. In the case of Carrie, vengeance was a dish served immediately, all in a flashy red, one of the film's leitmotifs, and the climax is still now, a staple of modern horror movies and an indicator that the 70's were a terrific decade in every level.And it also works on a slightly pervert level, as we all feel somewhat satisfied when some of the bullies get their comeuppance, no matter how extreme they are, then the fact that innocents die too reminds us that one should not cheer for violence and accept that bullies can be victims and victim can be bullies, although in the case of Carrie, a very extreme type. It seems reliant on voyeuristic and manipulative tricks but when you look closer, it's far beyond these clichés and respects the viewers' intelligence more than your usual horror flicks.",9,0,0,17 January 2017
Marriage Story," Scenes From a Broken Marriage ...
","40 years after 'Kramer vs. Kramer', here comes Noah Baumbach's 'Marriage Story', a well-written, well-directed and certainly well-acted movie tackling the difficult subject of divorce and through it marriage, responsibility... and love. That the film is a major Oscar contender doesn't surprise me but I like what that critical acclaim reflects: a movie about divorce must obey to higher standards of filmmaking than any drama subgenre; many are masterpieces such as Farhadi's 'Separation' or Bergman's 'Scenes from a Marriage'.The point of a divorce film isn't to take sides, you've got to show two persons with their strengths, flaws, the qualities they take for granted and weaknesses they don't suspect. The three-dimensionality you bring up to the characters and the way they interact through conflicts, tenderness or awkward moments have the challenging complexity of an emotional Rubik-cube game. A quote in 'Marriage Story' says 'crime lawyers see bad people at their best, divorce lawyers see good people at their worst' and that's the point: marriage movies insist on flaws that are only flipsides of qualities.And so the film starts beautifully with two monologues from each of Charlie (Adam Driver) and Nicole (Scarlet Johansson), describing what they like best in each other. The descriptions insist on so many details that it's impossible not to relate to both of them, I often brew tea I end up not drinking like Nicole and I'm a bad loser when it comes to games like Charlie. The opening monologues are exposition masterstrokes (with a twist at the end), allowing us to know about the couple, their roles as parents and their jobs: Charlie is a theater director who found a muse in Nicole, a previous TV star who abandoned her dreams for Charlie.Together they had a child named Henry (a reference to Justin Henry who played Billy in 'Kramer'?), the kid played by Azhy Robertson, is obviously the sinews of the war. Since Charlie lives and works in New York and Nicole stars in a TV show shot in L.A., much more they married in L.A. and it's Henry's birthplace, there's more at stakes than a matter of custody. Charlie wants Henry back to New York but Nicole's rising career is in L.A.. The battle opens with promises never to go to court but we know it's a matter of inevitability. The trick is that no one wants to accuse the other of bad parenting, nor to brag about being the better parent, it's all about saying what's best for the kid.But can any parent be that objective when it comes to the child? Spending more time with his mother, Henry's bias leans in her direction while Charlie becomes the stranger who does his best to accommodate him. It takes someone who's gone through divorce to understand Charlie's situation. I see my own daughter twice every month during weekends and half the holidays, and whenever I see her I feel forced to satisfy her caprices, which is not the right way to educate, but since you're put in a situation where you want to live the moment to its fullest and not spoil it, you spoil your kid.And when the kid behaves badly, you almost take it as an affront... and must endure people who pretend not to judge your parenting and you know they do. That's the paradox of divorce, you try to display the best parenting and yet it might be perceived as the worst like in that sequence where Charlie is being observed and does his best to avoid complications... that ultimately happen. Divorce complicates relationships and I'm glad a film could show it so remarkably, with brutality or humor.I saw 'Kramer' with my then-wife and she ended up (to my surprise) rooting with Ted while I kind of empathized with Joanna, especially her suffocation through marital commitment and wish to find herself. It's important not to make a conflict binary and this is why the 'character study' is important, why we should understand someone's inner personalities. Charlie is an artist who's dedicated to his art in a disciplined manner, Nicole is a dreamer who needs to be her own master. Together they love each other but here's what I said about Bergman's 'Scenes from a Marriage':'While loving someone is a genuine feeling, being married implies duties whose applications might interfere with our inner personalities. Whether it's sex life, success and dreams, they can be undermined by marital life. The danger is to start looking at the man or the woman of our life as the one who's sinking it into the abysses of routine and conventions.'That's how Nicole started to look at Charlie and vice versa, that's the way she describes him in a bravura speech where she tells her lawyer (a scene-stealing Laura Dern) how she feels about him, and a later moment where Charlie vents his anger on Nicole and culminates with a wish to see her die, before busting into tears. I love that he regained his composure and said 'sorry' and that Nicole didn't even take it badly, it's for subtle moments like this that I think the film should take home a few golden boys. Driver has a raw natural magnetism and Johannson is given the most difficult role and both are perfect in acting naturally and also unnaturally. The best 'actors' being the lawyers.As someone who went through these stages of bargains through love letters, these moments where we cry ourselves to sleep, anger when we blame the other for failing the marriage vows and we realize we won't see our children regularly, when we even miss the in-laws, the film is poignantly cathartic even in a resigned state.And I mentioned the notion of 'acting' in marriage, maybe the real act of fidelity in marriage is to be faithful to yourself in the first place. What Charlie and Nicole achieve at the end.",9,14,28,8 December 2019
The Queen," Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown...
","If there ever was a moment where the authority of Queen Elizabeth II was severely shaken out, where the eventuality of abolishing the monarchy stopped being taboo, it's certainly the week after Lady Di's death. A magnificent rendition of this brief but tumultuous period in British' history, Stephen Frears' 'The Queen' chronicles the series of events that took place between the car crash and the public funeral in West Minster.But more than a political film, 'The Queen' is constructed like an exhilarating psychological arm-wrestling between two antagonistic forces: the freshly elected Prime Minister Tony Blair and Queen Elizabeth II. Blair had won by a landslide and Elizabeth was incarnating the very establishment the main body of his electors stood against. It's interestingly mentioned that the Queen can't vote because she's above the government, yet the opening meeting with Blair almost belies this fact. As Cherrie Blair tells her husband, people elected him; he's legitimate while the Queen is just a symbol. Peter Morgan's Oscar-nominated screenplay strikes by a very efficient simplicity by clearly setting the two antagonisms right in the beginning.Being the same age than Prince William, I'm old enough to remember this Sunday morning, Diana was dead car accident, paparazzi, well, the causes were as obvious as its aftermath was shocking. I remember I saw women of my family crying and I wondered why? Mother Theresa would die a few days later and I can't remember anyone crying over her loss yet she certainly did more than Lady Di. But Lady Diana was young, beautiful, caring, and in her way, she was embodying a sort of emotional struggle and incarnating an unreachable dream. If she wasn't an innocent victim, her death made her a martyr of her own status. And one thing for sure, she had simply won the people's hearts. And whether it's the press that guides the feelings or the opposite mattered less than two realities Blair and Elizabeth had to deal with: Britain is a media-centric society and people's emotions never lie. It's indeed impossible to doubt over the sincerity of those who wept, cried or put flowers in Buckingham Palace. Their denial was understandable, but then so was the next stage of grief: anger. Diana's brother accused journalists of having blood on their hands, and people got angry toward the Royal Family's reaction, or lack of reaction as a matter of fact: no half-mast flag, a vacation in Balmoral Palace. The shift between Her Majesty and Britain got wider, crystallizing a popular anger  while Tony Blair was the man of the situation.Helen Mirren's performance is essential as she conveys a subtle nuance of emotionality behind her solid attachment to protocol and of the legendary British sense of composure, this capability to take grief in silence and dignity. At one point, she even confesses her admiration to Muslim rituals where people are buried within the day of the death. The irony is that it's also out of respect for Diana that she wish her funeral would remain private, while the newspapers that criticize the Royal Family are still making money out of her death and maybe use the Royal Family as a convenient scapegoat. If one thing, the script cleverly highlights the complexities of human actions while the noblest actions and not necessarily guided by the noblest motives. The 'people's princess' that earned a leap in Blair's popularity feels less spontaneous and the character of Alastair, the cynical communication adviser incarnates this defiance toward the Queen just 'for the sake of it'. Even Cherrie Blair seems is more hostile to the Queen than Blair, and it does create an instinctive empathy toward Elizabeth. Meanwhile, the film avoids the opposite Manichaeism by showing a Tony Blair convinced that Britain needs monarchy, while on the Royal Family side, Queen Mum and Prince Edward (a grouchy James Cromwell) don't feel concerned by Diana's death. 'The Queen' is a battle of opinions, of human relationships and work as a psychological drama. When the Queen accepts to speak, a tabloid titles 'the Queen bends knee to Blair', but it's not Blair's victory that is highlighted here. Blair understands that the Queen must speak for her own interests. And Elizabeth's dilemma leads the story to a more introspective road where she would finally realize that she failed to be on the same wavelength than her people. She didn't bend knee to Tony, but to the people. The film ends two months after the tumultuous weeks when both Tony and the Queen meet again. It's friendlier and warmer, Blair enjoyed the double prestige of having won both the people's heart and preserved the prestige of the Royal Family, but Elizabeth doesn't display much gratitude and warns Blair against the volatility of people' opinions. Indeed, if a Queen who reigned over 40 years (60 now) failed to understand her people once, it could happen to him as well. The film was released in 2006, before Tony Blair's resignation. And it's interesting to note how times have significantly changed and what turned around came around. Now, Tony Blair is mostly remembered for his disastrous alliance with George W. Bush in the infamous War Iraq -and contrarily to Elizabeth, Blair didn't make a mea culpa, he never regretted his involvement- while the Queen is more respected than ever, the marriage between Charles and Camilla is accepted, William and Kate are under the spots. Maybe it's true that in a media-centric society, emotions can be guided, and what remain strong enough to last are the institutions. And Helen Mirren perfectly captured the unflappability of a sacred institution with still a faithful respect toward people, and for that, she truly deserved her Oscar.",10,4,6,10 September 2012
Raging Bull," Brutally Powerful Portrayal of Anger, Frustration and Jealousy
","I understand why this film is regarded as a classic. In fact, from the very beginning, the film has a kind of unique feeling, it's almost shouting, and loudly, 'This is not 'Rocky'': from the classic opening score, to the shadowy black and white cinematography, the director is the first real star of the film : Martin Scorsese, the heavy-weight champion of film-making, probably the most talented director of his generation. The use of Black & White prevented the film from an overdose of red but the pay-off, was its 'classic' look. When De Niro was reciting Brando's lines you could almost feel you were watching 'On the Waterfront'.But I must admit I had mixed feelings with 'Raging Bull' at first. On one side, I was literally mesmerized by De Niro's brutally powerful performance as a man devoured by jealousy. In fact, this jealousy, driven by a probably very low self-esteem works almost like a gangrene. Following the development of his character, you know that sooner or later, the guy's gonna reach a breaking point and the effects will be devastating. On the other side, this jealousy created a bit of redundancy in the movie, 'let's face it' (like Terry Malloy would say), the scenes, although beautifully directed, making Vickie La Motta floating from man to man (great job by Marty, jealousy had never been so perfectly captured in film), those scenes were kind of repetitive, and upsetting. Upsetting in a good way because we're not necessarily supposed to root for La Motta but at least react to his shocking behavior and aggressive attitude. And upsetting in a bad way, because I was wondering all through the movie, 'Okay, we got it, the guy is jealous' until the movie reminded of 'A Women Under the Influence', another masterpiece where a character's behavior, makes you feel so uncomfortable, you don't want to watch. And that's how 'Raging Bull' is a very particular movie. I hope every fan of this film can at least concede that it takes more than one or two viewings to let the film grow on you. And it's not that easy to consider it one of 'the best ever' after one viewing. 'Raging Bull' is interesting because it's one of the few character studies that make you question the main roots of the character's behavior, the motives. Travis Bickle was alienated and frustrated, Charlie was torn between friendship and quest for redemption. In La Motta's case, it's hard to come to a conclusion. We know how he is, but why? why such a paranoid behavior that ultimately lead him to lose his family. Paranoia can be explained, take a character like Michael Corleone for instead, but for La Motta, it seemed irrational.Then I realized the answer was in one, often overlooked, key scene, the Janiro fight. I will blaspheme by comparing the movie to a more recent one, but it reminded me of the scene in 'Fight Club' when the narrator destroyed Angel Face -'something beautiful'. The violence La Motta injected in that fight made it look like a personal vengeance, massacring, 'executing' Janiro's face as a message to his wife, 'you thought he was pretty, now he ain't pretty no more'. Ruthless, but powerful, because it shows how low is his self-esteem. Destruction is the weapon of the envious, he doesn't try to improve himself but to destroy the challenger and stay the one and only one. Low self-esteem doesn't mean lack of an ego, but La Motta's one is so twisted, so hard to grab, to understand, we try at least to find it sympathetic, and it only works because the character is pathetic, victim of himself. And this characteristic finally redeems him in the iconic jail scene, where the pathos reaches its paroxysm, when he can finally shout, break down, hit the wall with his bare fists and his head, and cry, realizing how hard he failed. This is the highlight of the film, the scene that makes him profoundly human, and as a viewer, I could at least make peace with him and appreciate the character, and the film. This is the pay-off of all the frustration, anger, discomfort I felt.Jake thought his wife was a whore, blinded by an extreme machismo tainted with paranoid jealousy. He even accused his brother, his only real friend of being a member of this conspiracy. At the end, he lost everything. How pathetic he was outside the ring contrasts with his strength and ferocity inside, he hits and takes the hits, exorcising his own demons in this arena where he's the king. 'Raging Bull' is often compared with 'Rocky', well, despite the difference of mood, one thing they have in common, is how the ring appears to be an allegory for desire of revenge. In 'Raging Bull', some shots are so aesthetically exaggerated that it's like it was intended to be kept proportional to all the griefs, all the feelings of low self-esteem that were burning in Jake's mind. In the ring, these feelings explode like a geyser of blood. Even when the Bull finds his 'toreador', he's ugly and destroyed, but he's still standing, he's still 'the boss'.I used to be very critical towards 'Raging Bull', I never understood why this film was praised as one of the best ever, or #4 in AFI's Top 100. Now, I know it's a raw portrayal of a man we don't feel sympathy for him because we don't want to, the character is not to blame. We are, we're no better than La Motta because at least he took the hits until the 'right' one hit him in the face. It took me time to realize that 'Raging Bull' was indeed a masterpiece. Don't blame me. I guess all I can say is that 'once I was blind and now I can see.'",9,4,7,3 January 2011
The Woman in Black," As scary as a 'Ghost Train' ride ...
","At first sight, James Watkins' film looks formatted to please an audience thirsty for thrills and heart-pounding experiences, it stars Daniel Radcliffe, Harry Potter in a first adult-to-be- taken-seriously role (and as a matter of fact, I did took him seriously) and the title is perfect to convey both a sensation of fear or mystery, I wish it could have been more original than 'The Woman in Black' but as an audience-pulling title, it's perfectly marketed.Now, reviewing 'The Woman in Black' is quite a challenge as far as objectivity is concerned. As a horror film, it did one hell of a job because it truly scared the hell out of me, but as one IMDb user pointed out, there is a huge difference between making someone jump out of his seat and actually scaring him. By the way, I couldn't believe a veteran critic like Roger Ebert missed those tricks, so blatantly overused, well a bit too much in a film that tries to use some sophistication in an Edwardian English setting (I would have said Victorian until I noticed there were cars). 'The Woman in Black' should have inspired a delightful to read cynical review, but he sounds satisfied then allow me to more bitter. It's not against the film, overall, it was short enough not to become quickly unbearable.The problem in 'The Woman in Black' is that the film succeeds in creating a harrowing and haunting atmosphere, and Daniel Racliffe's performance carries the fears and the interrogation of the typical protagonist who doesn't know where he's putting his foot in but must do it because it's part of his mission. So, for a film that had all the technical predispositions to be a great mystery thriller, cinematography, directing, acting and editing, I couldn't believe it would go for so many cheap attempts to scare audience regardless of the context and the content of the story. On that level, 'The Woman in Black' was as scary as a ghost train, where most of the frights and shocks rely on the surprise effect, as efficient as they are predictable, which cancels out the merit of the film.Indeed, watching 'The Woman in Black' made me realize how it was easy to scare people, I can't count how many persons in the theater screamed and I almost had to cover my eyes at some parts of the film, not because I was genuinely scared but because I knew something was going to happen, yes it was scary but when you expect to be scared, the whole experience consists on not being surprised by a disturbing image that just pops up in the screen. It's just as if James Watkins, the director (so you can remember his name), took to its fullest the overused concept of some Youtube videos: a quiet and comforting moment and then suddenly, a screaming face appears to instantly increase your heart pulses, an idea already based on the 'ghost train' principle.And what's even worse for the film's attempts to scare its audience is in the setting of the haunted mansion, so full of weird and hard to watch objects, so ugly that it only takes a close-up or a sudden shot on one of them to perturb the audience. All the mechanical toys, dolls and automatons seem to belong to the house for the only purpose of 'appearing', nothing else justifies their presence, at one point, one appears inoffensive and then it starts playing drums so suddenly that again, we wonder why Watkins didn't trust his story's own material. Well, the monkey playing drums had its effect okay, but was Watkins so desperately eager to scare us that he needed to let one whole sequence relying on that.'The Woman in Black' doesn't trust its own potential, and never gives enough credit to their characters, nor does it trust our intelligence. The film evolves in such an enigmatic atmosphere that we have no clue about what's going on. But it's part of the genre and we expect a mind-blowing experience coming near the end, until the protagonist, his name was Kipps (I had to check as I totally forgot about it after the film) enters the haunted house, and we start to make some vague correlations between the presence of a ghostly figure, a woman in black screaming like a vulgar subliminal Internet-prank image, and a series of disturbing children's deaths, and their deaths would be indeed efficient if the build-ups were not so overdone.Anyway, before this review starts to sound too cynical, I want to point out that anything beyond what I said worked decently. I was amazed by Daniel Radcliffe's photogenic look, convincing as a tormented soul with a wound in his heart, the atmosphere of the film have some reminiscent shots of 'The Shining', like the long and tortuous road that lead to the land where Kipps had to work on the estate. And the hostility of the population nicely contrasted with his interesting friendship with a rich landowner named  whatever. Anyway, near the center of the film, the story started to be easier to follow and not uninteresting. A feeling that doesn't last unfortunately when it starts to scare for the sake of scares.Is it me or I feel like I'm repeating myself? Well, I guess it's time for me to conclude by saying that the film had quite a powerful ending that seemed to belong to another film. If 'The Woman is Black' had the same gripping intensity than the last scene, it would have made so many cheap tricks like the overuse of shadows, the ominous music and the whole subliminal startling moments totally needless. 'The Woman in Black' is not a bad film, but unfortunately falls too much in the category of exercises in style and  to use in my turn an overused line, with no substance.",6,1,2,18 March 2012
Mary and Max," So many letters to define Mary and Max, and not enough words to describe them...
","Every once in a while, there's a movie you expect to 'watch' but what happens after the very first minutes goes beyond the idea of watching. I had 'Mary and Max' pending in my watch-list for a long time mainly because of its presence in the Top 250. So, when I found it in the DVD store, I thought time had come to give it a shot. Well, let's just say that after five minutes, I was entranced by its beautiful ugliness and if I had one intimate conviction is that it would not disappoint me and that every second of it was to be savored like a tiny bite of my favorite chocolate.That film is Adam Elliott's 'Mary and Max', and it's so profoundly and deeply human that it drowns you into its story. It's about two persons who couldn't have been more opposite, age-wise and geographically, but they have in common a few things like their initials, their passion for chocolate, for Smurfs-like creatures named Noblets and last but not least, they're outcasts. Mary is a shy, insecure Australian girl with an odd birth mark looking like poo stain on her forehead, that she wears glasses and is a bit plump completes the ungrateful portrait. But the tone of the film never mocks her, she's not that way because she's supposed to incarnate a stereotype, her personality is the consequence of her insecurity which is a consequence of her appearance. Anyone who's been an insecure child can relate to Mary, and one who was lucky enough to meet beauty standards can at least feel for her, because people like Mary tend to develop a rare virtue in our individualistic world: she care for others, she's empathetic.She's also extremely curious and naive like any child, and just to fulfill her curiosity, she opens an American phone book and rips a page that contains the address of Max Horowitz, a New Yorker, she sends him a letter, asking a few random question about babies and the stuff she likes. Little did she know that she had just started a twenty-year correspondence and one of the most beautiful on-screen friendships, and friendships are never as believable and solid as when they're slowly built by the passing of time, and step by step, the letters Max will receive from Mary will become an indispensable part of his life. And we're not even shocked that this is going between a little girl and a man in his forties because for one thing, their exchanges exude sincerity. Later, Max finally reveals he's got Asperger's syndrome, which finally explains why so many things make him irritable, including a few letters from Mary.These letters occupy the most of the film, but they never, absolutely never, feel as fillers, they help us to learn more about the evolution (or lack of) of Mary and Max and the people who populate their world. Mary's father is an ordinary man whose work in a tea bag factory inspired Mary's dream to marry an Englishman named Earl Grey and live in Scotland with her nine babies. Mary's mother, an alcoholic kleptomaniac, is the kind of mother you wouldn't even wish for your bully, and if it wasn't for a providential slip, Mary would never have read Max' first letter and know how much they had in common, in fact, she would have never known him, period.There is something very true to life in these letters, they tell you more than Mary or Max' lives, they're about the cathartic effect of writing, having someone we can share our problems with as a tool to overcome our own weaknesses. And many people with lamentable social skills have a tremendous capability for expressing their emotions, because they spent so much time in long introspection they know exactly what's going inside. In a way, Mary and Max' blessings came from their curses, and in some of the film's most heartbreaking moments, they both recall the worst episodes of their life, especially when they were bullied. There's a scene with a kid taking Mary's sandwich and peeing on it, and yes, kids can be that cruel. A victim of bullying will never understand the bully's delight in violence because of this empathy. And having discussed about bullying lately, the film sure hit a sensitive chord.Max is a pacifist, but he's not much an empathetic man, more of the apathetic kind, he lives his life according to his nature and never questions his social disabilities, like anyone, he has a past with its burdens and its positive stuff, he regularly sees a therapist Dr. Hazelhof and tries more or less to give a meaning to his life, and what better than goals to achieve this. Basically, Max' got three goals in life: collecting all the Noblets, having chocolate supply for life and having a friend, not an imaginary one. This is the effect Mary has on Max and through an extraordinary reciprocity, even Max positively influences Mary. Well, by that point of the film, it either comes to go further and spoil it or just invite anybody who thinks he or she's seen all in movies to watch this magnificent little gem. I was shocked that it didn't make it in the Oscar nominations because it IS a powerful existential masterpiece.It has the upbeat poetry of 'Amélie', the dark humor of 'About Schmidt' (which was also about an old curmudgeon venting his anger through a letter he sent to a little African boy) but the result is admirably original because the letters make the plot, they're not accessories to it and because the ending is just perfect. I'm not saying it's sad or it's happy, it's just that after one hour and half of this existential ride, we have an emotionally rewarding ending.",10,3,6,25 August 2016
Shrek," When DreamWorks reared its ugly head...
","You know the Simpsons joke of the blue-haired lawyer representing Disney whenever a public domain's character is impersonated, well this running-gag reflects a general feeling that all the princesses, little pigs or fairies belong to Disney, and no one would dare or care of touching them, not to make the lawyers sharpen their nails anyway.But once upon a time a studio named DreamWorks, whose works' dream was to kick the the round-ear giant's butt by playing his own game without the same rules. So their movie starts with a book (just like in Uncle Disney's classics) whose first pages tell us about a princess victim of a spell, and waiting for her savior in a high dungeon guarded by a drag nonsense, shouts the reader, tearing the page and leaving the toilet a few seconds later. Well, what he did with the paper might be the extreme way to describe DreamWorks' attitude toward Disney, from us who consider Disney and fairy tales as alter-egos.But by parodying all its fairy-tale darlings, it's less a thumb nose on Disney that an irreverence setting the tone of the future of Animation. Before 'Shrek', movies like 'Toy Story', 'A Bug's Life' or 'Ants' evolved in very cartoon-like universes and only 3D enhanced their originality. Once the novelty was over, films like 'Dinosaurs' would feature dazzling and realistic environments. But who remembers 'Dinosaurs'? 'Shrek' had distinctive characters, and great technology to define their movements, fur, skin or body language, but more than anything, it had a terrific story to tell.For all these reasons, it was the first Oscar animated feature winner, beating 'Monsters, Inc.' from pioneer Pixar. Disney paved the way to 3D animation with 'Toy Story' in 1995 yet it is its foremost rival that gets the seminal award. Both would be listed in the American Film Institute's Top 1 Animated movies, and 'Shrek' at eight position is the only non Disney film. While there's no doubt that Disney had the lion-share of recognition on this field, I'm convinced that the enthusiasm, energy and perfectionism that was put in their later works were boosted by DreamWorks' affront in 2001.'Shrek' might look like an anti-Disney film, but it's for Disney's own good, an invitation to use, simple stories involving a great deal of fun, friendship and a well-balanced dose of adult-oriented humor, with enough simplicity on the surface to appeal to children. Pixar would later beat DreamWorks on that game but in 2001, 'Shrek' was the triumphant story, the hero is an ogre, the sidekick is a donkey), the villain is a Kingdom ruler who's not a king yet for technicality, and the princess is a princess but with more style, character and pep than all the other Disney princesses put together. 'Shrek' takes into a very familiar universe, but gives it a sly edge, a saucy and raunchy humor, and still affords the luxury to have a sensibility.The secret of 'Shrek' is to exploit the one thing Disney would never do, making adult humor and mocking its creation. When Shrek and the Donkey discovers the castle of Sir Farquard, they wonder if he's not compensating for something, later this is used again, and makes the gag twice funnier. The Disney bashing is less tricky and has never been as efficient as when Princess Fiona hums a song with a bird, with such high-pitched octaves he poor creature explodes. That alone was funny, but that she uses the birds' three eggs to make a breakfast is just the bit of genius that justifies all the film's reputation.And indeed, the magic of Shrek is to use familiar situation for different outcomes, whether the dragon in the castle or a Robin Hood gang, the film always finds a way to surprise you, hell, can you even imagine that milk being poured on a glass will mean that a Gingerbread is about to be tortured? 'Shrek' is surprise after surprise, and yet manages to get more archetypal when needed to, because it doesn't let the laughs guide the story, but develops a sweet and tender romance between Shrek and Fiona who have more in common than they think.Indeed, Shrek only terrorizes people to precede their reaction and not be hurt by their feelings. Princess Fiona is no typical either, and the charm of the film is to learn more about these characters as the plot advances. And 'Shrek' finds the perfect balance between gags and drama, so that it turns into one of the all-time greatest romances, spanning three more sequels while sequels to fairy tales have never been Disney's strong suits. But you can't have a character like Shrek or Fiona or the Donkey reduced to one simple film, especially considering the time it took to make them grace the silver screen.The project started in 1994, the same years than 'Toy Story', except that it took more time for DreamWorks to get the job done, Shrek's part was recorded with Chris Farley but it would finally be Mike Meyers to take the role and give it a slight Scottish accent. Eddie Murphy was given the role of a lifetime by injecting his zany persona to the most happy-go-lucky, optimistic Donkey ever, and more than honorable mentions to Cameron Diaz as Princess Fiona, or John Lithgow as Farquaad. Like in 'Toy Story', the choice of voice-actors is part of the marketing and can be sometimes distracting, except when the story is so absorbing. That Donkey's voice is Eddie Murphy's is secondary in relation to his hilarious one-liners.'Shrek' showed the light to the future of animation, but beyond its influential significance, 'Shrek' is a standout animated classic, the only one I can recall, with a twist ending. I still remember, in the theater, I didn't like the ending, until I realized it was the perfect one. How many movies, animated or not, can contradict your feelings, but for perfect reasons?",10,0,2,23 June 2016
The Silence of the Lambs," A Modern Horror Masterpiece ...
","If there ever was a movie genre that needed constant renovations in order to maintain its appeal, it's certainly Horror, and at this level, 'The Silence of the Lambs' didn't just reinvent but transcended it.Fear is based on a simple principle : the 'boo' effect. The less we expect something to happen, the most it scares us. 'Psycho', by featuring a totally demented boy-next-door villain, terrified an audience used to associate horror with vampires and exotic monsters. 'The Exorcist' pushed the level of realism to a magnificent artistry while 'Jaws' suggested a mysterious presence, keeping it even more frightening, a device sublimated by the movies 'Alien' and 'The Shining'. All these movies shared an iconic significance in the evolution of Thriller and more specifically Horror films and it seemed like nothing could surprise a mature audience anymore This situation worsened with the consecration of slasher films and their overused cheap-plotted formulas making uncertain recipes out of classic ingredients, notably those introduced by the previous masterpieces : hemoglobin overdose, gruesome over-the-top special effects and various experimentations that pushed the genre down to Z-movies in the worst case, and in the best, B-movies with a cult status. So, a masterpiece built out of a new and fresh material was begging to be made. And cinematic Gods attributed this mission to Jonathan Demme with the classic 'Silence of the Lambs', the first Horror film to win the Oscar for Best Picture. Finally.'The Silence of the Lambs' is one of the greatest cinematic achievements of cinema's history. Every single element contributes to create a disturbing and unique atmosphere, and I use very carefully the word 'unique'. I highly doubt anyone was reminded of a villain with the same caliber as Dr. Hannibal -with the chilling rhyming nickname- Lecter, masterfully personified by Anthony Hopkins. I doubt anyone remembers a similar movie where a young, vulnerable and non-Ellen-Ripley looking girl doesn't play the victim, nor the hero's love interest, but the actual heroine. Clarice Starling, as a FBI trainee is played by Jodie Foster, in a performance subtly combining feminine vulnerability and heroic tenacity. And no one would have expected the film to have a binary structure with a classic serial-killer's investigation in one hand, and a subplot involving one of the greatest movie villains of all-time and his interaction with the heroine, on the other.The script is tightly constructed, patiently leading us to assemble each piece of the puzzle until the series of interactions between Clarice and Hannibal approaches a disturbing truth. The relationship between the two leads is even more fascinating because it deepens their personalities and allows us to get more and more in their background : the wounds in Clarice's past, the mystery around Hannibal Lecter, and the roots of evil that inspired the serial killers' acts. And this is where the freshness of the film relies on : its capability to put everything into perspective and invite our perceptions to go beyond the simple 'good vs. evil' dichotomy. The villain are no sharks, no monsters, no possessing demons, they are everyday men, like some Norman Bates with an extra level of savagery and pervert creativity and we try to understand to better fight them, under the pervert irony that the investigation requires a psychopathic mind to arrest another one.Talking about psychopath, the way Hannibal is introduced after the first minutes is impressive and gloomy enough to make us expect the worst and when we finally see him, standing, well-dressed, clean cut, the impact is immediate. Demme's meticulous direction introduces Clarice in a very clever way too, she's basically a girl enduring a lot of stress and hardship while trying to overcome a physically handicapping feminine condition in a world of men. There's one scene where she enters an elevator, surrounded by a group of men whose big sizes emphasize her tininess. Another moment shows her trying to handle a group of officers standing in a room, assessing a minimum of authority. Clarice Starling is endearing and engaging as the heroine driven by a desire of justice and accomplishment, and the trust or fondness developed by both the Agent in Charge, Crawford, played by Scott Glenn, and maybe Hannibal Lecter, himself. After all, the many close-ups on his face during his interrogations and the suavity of his voice suggest a disturbing feel of intimacy between him and Clarice. And as the investigations progresses, the extraordinary portrayal of the real villain of the film, by an underrated Ted Levine, keeps us hooked until the final confrontation. If you noticed, I mentioned every element that generally makes a great movie, writing, acting, directing, the movie was indeed the third, and last to date, to win the five major Academy Awards, after 'It Happened One Night' and 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'. It had this classic feeling from the day it was released because it combined so many new elements that defined the notion of psychological thriller, before it became a trend. And it's no surprise that the film topped many list from the American Film Institute, #5 of AFI's 100 Thrills, #6 heroine, and good ol' Hannibal as number one movie villain, and he wasn't even the main antagonist in the film, which says as much as his winning the Oscar for less than 20 minutes on-screen, to find a character with the same cinematic aura, I guess we would go back to Vito Corleone.'The Silence of the Lambs' reinvented the horror genre as the kind of movie that would have made Alfred Hitchcock proud : a scary villain, a sympathetic hero, a script respecting our intelligence, top-notch direction and editing, and for one thing, it didn't even need a twist ending",10,6,14,14 August 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," Did he have to sink so low... before he rises?
","Well, I just wished he could rise a little higher above my expectations. This is certainly not a bad movie, far from it, it's effective in the way it wraps us all the elements of 'Batman Begins' and 'The Dark Knight' and heads them into a satisfactory conclusion. But if you discount the ending, the film was a real downer... with every character carrying the most contradictory motives, even Bruce Wayne who lived recluse after Batman's disgrace had to drown his soul in a contemplative ennui that irritates Alfred... and ordinary viewers do not have Alfred's patience.I got back to my reviews of the first two first films, and both had one thing in common: they were positively thrilling, something that hooked your mind and filled your heart with an enthusiastic je-ne-sais-quoi. 'Batman Begins' started 'slowly' as it didn't show much of the archetypal Batman until his reveal, but boy, what a great moment! I cheered when Batman made his entrance and later came full circle with his demons. Then the Joker deconstructed the edifice of pompousness built by the 'good guys' and with such style and gusto he almost made his 'point' and confronted both Batman and Harvey Dent to painful ironies (delightful for him). Dent lost his idealism but not Wayne.
 Now 'The Dark Knight Rises' was necessary because Batman needed a rehabilitation. Or did he? After all, Gotham City lived in peace and since 'innocent is too strong a word to use against' Gotham people, it was quite an achievement. If the price was Honest Gordon praising the man who threatened his own child and Batman's exile, why would Wayne care? After all, vigilante wasn't a vocation but a necessity, to serve justice and fight criminals, if crime stopped, so should his melancholy. Yet Wayne is clearly affected, health problems and loss of cartilage forced him to walk with a cane, but we suspect the pain is underneath rather on the body. I think that romantic grieving angle could have been more interesting than the predictable urban mayhem that strikes Gotham in every 'Gotham' episode. Indeed, I wish Nolan was less ambitious on the field of special effects and cared a little more for Bruce Wayne like he did in the first films, wishful thinking. Wayne is the same all right and there's nothing two-dimensional in Christian Bale's portrayal, the problem is simply arithmetic. In the first film, we had Wayne, in the second Wayne/Dent/Joker, here, we have to concentrate on so many supporting players that I wondered if the film wasn't intended for the hardcore fans who'll watch it over and over again. I'm afraid that a first viewing isn't enough to get the film, it was for the previous ones. Where to start? You have Catwoman who swings between the role of a protagonist and then antagonist with the agility of a cat jumping between clotheslines. Anne Hathaway is actually terrific but exudes so many sensual 'femme fatale' vibes that she creates an unfortunate sense of redundancy with Marion Cotillard as Miranda Tate. Wayne has a way with women but Nolan should have thought about making them a little more different, sometimes it goes as simply as making one blonde and another dark-haired. Both women are secretive, talk in enigmatic insinuation and existential innuendo, there's always an element of seduction you can't put your finger on but after a while, you start to envy Alfred's celibacy.Now, Nolan isn't exactly the ideal director when you yearn for clarity but I take again the first 'Batman' films, both had complex plots but not complicated... and they had great villains. Another problem is with the Alpha-villain in this film, Bane has a spectacular action-establishing moment that leaves no doubt that he's the match for Batman... as he seems as tortured a soul and in pain than his nemesis. But then again, I was really scratching my head to figure out what Bane's real motives were, he speaks like some revolutionary leader who believe the ends justify the means but his vision of chaos seem rather pointless... except if it was to get his kicks, that would have been good enough for me, does every character need to be tormented about something?The Joker loved chaos and disorder because they could reveal deeper truths about our own ambivalences, and whatever he did, he did it with style. Tom Hardy is great as Bane, and intimidating as well, as hell, but he's just like a rollercoaster of muscle with a Darth-Vader face and a Scottish accent, whenever he appeared on the film, I just felt uneasy. I know his presence would mean pain, punches, killing, intimidations, which is good for a villain, but the film was way too dark and gloomy that I was begging for a little relief. I think what I get from the 'Batman' series is that the villains have fun being bad, pleasing oneself being the most selfish motive, Bane didn't have fun at all... and he was the main villain, so that didn't leave much fun to the story.So let's recapitulate, we have similar female characters with uncertain motives (some revealed near the end), Wayne in his usual 'who am I?' quest, a villain who doesn't enjoy what he does but feels it's necessary, a commissioner who can't get over his lies and his separation, in this ocean of gloom, only Joseph Gordon Levitt as a Batman admirer seems to carry the last hope of idealism... not that it brings much to the film. Paraphrasing Alfred, I wouldn't say that Nolan failed his fans (not according to IMDb ratings) but one of the reasons I avoided these films is because he always struck me as a director who like his characters sorry, sad, angry, and way too serious, I was glad I was wrong with the first two films, I was for that third opus, maybe he should have pulled a Joker and ask himself indeed 'why so serious?'.",7,2,2,23 May 2018
Creed II," A great victory can be a matter of reconciling yourself with a few defeats...
","On the ring of its four-decade spanning narrative, the greatest opponent to the 'Rocky/Creed' franchise has always been formula. The reason why the original 'Rocky' was such an endearing movie (and the series' best) is that it didn't end with the expected victory and yet Rocky Balboa became the underdogs' patron saint.So no matter how good or entertaining the sequels were, something was missing or maybe too visible not to undermine the film's believability. It became all about rematches and revenges, the formulas divided the movies into three clear acts the starting point with 'everything's doing great' then 'everything's falling apart' leading to self-questioning and existential crises and finally 'everything's great again' with the final game, final bell music etc.Yet the series had found its own antidote against these schematic structures: heart. In 'II', Rocky proposed to Adrian, she lapsed into coma, they had their son, in 'III, Mickey died and Rocky's friendship with Apollo was sealed, there was always a way to look at another direction, but then something changed, the audiences became vaccinated against these emotional tricks. That could pass with 'Rocky IV' but 'Rocky V' was the one disgrace too many.Now let's be honest, 'Rocky Balboa' and 'Creed' aimed higher than their predecessors but they weren't that original. In 'Creed', it was the legacy of Apollo that made us care for young Adonis, Michael B. Jordan's spectacular performance did the rest and drew us into caring for his mother (Philycia Rashad) and Bianca (Tessa Thompson). But story-wise, neither of 'Rocky Balboa' or 'Creed' reinvented the wheel and owed their popularity to the whole series and the fact that time make characters like a good wine.The reason of this lengthy preamble is that 'Creed II', as anticipated as it was, didn't exactly start on solid ground. The 'surprise effect' was over, Adonis didn't have any major demons to fight anymore. Only the 'Rocky' situation with his son was left pending but after Stallone's nomination, it was time to remind viewers that it was about Adonis. And when I learned that the film would feature the son of Ivan Drago, the shadow of revenges and rematches began to haunt this movie.Formulas again. I expected history to repeat itself, the two games, one to lose, one to win. I expect the whole doubting about himself and fighting his demons, I even expected the emotional stuff, positive like the birth of the baby and negative with a little misunderstanding with Rocky. I could see this coming a mile way. Then why did I leave the theater so overwhelmed by emotion? Why did the film hit me so hard that it even lured me into taking some decisions with a few demons of mine? Why did I cry?Emotions can't lie, I love the 'Rocky' franchise but not to the point of blinding myself when it comes to flaws, this film isn't without a few missed shots but seriously, it's as good as the first 'Creed', if not better at times. Now, I have a dilemma. Should I go deeper in my analysis at the risk of making this a non spoiler-free review and preach a choir? Or should I just kept this vague enough to encourage the skeptics.You know what? Let's just spoil the whole thing because fans don't need anyone's blessing (kind of like any climactic fight in the series). I refuse to believe someone would need a review's endorsement so let's just that I loved it because it surprised me. And when the greatest opponent of a series is formula, 'surprise' can only be a victory. And I don't mean the overused 'going the distance', I mean the truly unexpected ones with an emotional impact, narratively, these are knock-out victories.The first surprise is that the film might have the best opponent after Apollo Creed. Clubber Lang was tough and raw but he too one-dimensional even in his colorfulness to be taken seriously, Ivan Drago was a killing machine who only needed a humbling experience, nothing substantial could come from him in a movie whose biggest shock was the loss of Apollo. Tommy Gunn was just a joke, and even in the last two films the opponents were only foils.But 'Creed II' had the master trump: Drago's son. It was risky because of the whole 'son against son' thing (sounds like a damn monster movie, as would Apollo said, 'rest his soul) but it works because as the movie progresses, we start to understand Drago's motives and they're interesting, then we draw parallels with Adonis' own motives and they're fascinating.Indeed, the film starts as your usual sequel and in a way you didn't see coming, becomes a film that makes you think not about victory, but about failing, about the poisoning effect of loss and abandonment in one's self-confidence, and even Rocky's backstory with his son joins the emotional band wagon and we don't have two but three plots that tie up together in a satisfying way, one that made me think of myself and made me realize that sometimes, the biggest victory is also to reconcile yourself with defeat.And for that, the film offers not just one but two powerful surprising outcomes, one where Adonis 'wins' on a technicality while lying on the ring after a real massacre, and another where Viktor Drago loses on a thrown towel, one of the best moments in the franchise, and in itself a victory that redeems the two Russians. Going the distance works in mysterious ways, it's one thing to keep moving forward, but knowing when to throw it can be the sum of all wisdoms.In a way that's what Rocky did when he went to see his son and grandson at the end, a sweet touch that made me realize it was time for him to leave gracefully and I'm sure that 'Creed' franchise is 'gonna fly' with its own wings.",9,0,0,20 January 2019
The Emperor's New Groove," This Emperor Has Clothes, and Moves, and Style...
","When you've been reviewing movies for a little while, you start to develop a few verbal symptoms, one of them is to adopt a sort of historian pose. I'll refrain from my usual impulses but just for a bit of contextualization, let's drop some information you're probably aware of. We know the 'Disney Renaissance' is said to have started in 1989 with 'Little Mermaid' and ended ten years later with 'Tarzan'. 1999 was also the year of the last Pixar acclaimed movie: 'Toy Story 2' before Disney would strike again in 2003 with 'Finding Nemo'.What we've got in between is a forgettable trend of direct-to-VHS (or DVD) sequels that spoiled the 'classic' status of movies we tended for classics, and a few movies that have sunk into oblivion in the sense that they are not as celebrated as others involving a cute clown-fish, a cooking rat and a flying house. Speaking for myself, I started to be a student in 2000 and I didn't really care about the new Disney movies, I didn't care for 'Dinosaurs', 'Atlantis' and I certainly didn't care for 'Emperor's New Groove' and it's not like the film didn't have publicity. After 17 years, I can only say 'Mea Culpa'. I was misinformed.I finally saw the film and I must say I've never laughed as much as I did since I saw the 'South Park' movie, the movie made me laugh to tears, and I mean tears. 'Kuzco' is one hilarious movie that should be more known on the sole basis of this achievement. But that's why I needed to contextualize the film, it was perhaps made at the worst possible timing, where a new generation of animators was still trying to find the right path, a revolutionary time that saw the change from VHS to DVD, from hand-drawn to computer-generated imagery. More than that, it was a time where Disney had probably used up all the classic fairy tale material, that forged its legend for seventy decades.And in 'Kuzco', there's no room for grandstanding themes, underdog heroes and heroines, Aesopian arcs and honorable quests, the hero or let's just call him a protagonist is a wise-cracking emperor so wrapped up in the confidence over his power that he ends up being transformed into a llama. But even that pitch might give you the wrong idea, I could also tell you that the Incan emperor has an ego the size of his gigantic palace and would never tolerate anyone ruining his projects and that his journey will allow him to discover the 'good' side of his personality, but even that would be too moralizing for a movie that is mostly made for laughs, and that's why I loved it.I won't spoil the gags but this is a guy who throws an old man from the window because he 'ruined his groove' or is about to kick a man with two kids and a pregnant village just to build a residential home, named Kuzcotopia. He's not even good by 'antiheroic' standards. And when the 'evil' counselor Izma is fired because she's abusing from her position, you're still wondering why you should deem her as the villain. But you know what, let's take all these trademark concepts, these 'hero', 'villain', 'quest', 'journey', 'sidekick' and throw them in the trashcan of our preconceived notions. This is a bowl of fresh air, finally an animated Disney movie designed as nothing else but a cartoon, it's exactly like 'Aladdin' and 'Hercules' without the fancy looking, sappy and romantic elements.To tell you how much I enjoyed the film, let's say that I had the feeling I was watching my good old Cartoon Network programs, 'Cow and Chicken', 'Johnny Bravo', even the old Looney Tunes and Tex Avery cartoons. In fact, there are even moments where the film channel some Chuck Jones vibes and the sights remind of the Road Runner. By being the less Disney-esque of all the Disney films, 'Kuzco' is an oddity that elevates itself above all the other movies, and that might include the classics. Indirectly, it even mirrors the boring pompousness of other well-polished, well- designed, well-crafted movies, that made it at the Top 10 box office at the the end of the year. 'Kuzco' didn't ('Dinosaurs' did) but it makes its discovery all the more enjoyable.And I liked it, I loved it. It's a harmless, lighthearted, fun movie, I could say 'little' but no, it's a masterpiece of laughs. And it's full of great and fun characters, four were enough to make the film, Kuzco the Emperor turned-llama and wise-ass-turned-good- guy, voiced by David Spade, the big and good-hearted Pacha who helps him in exchange of his promise to spare the village, but who actually can't prevent himself from doing a good thing, he's a Good Man played by the namesake John, and by the size, it was guessable. There's finally Yzma who's like a zanier version of Cruella De Vil (EarthaKitt) and her sidekick Kronk (Patrick Warburton) a mountain of a man but with a soft side, I mean can you make more gentle than someone who cooking and can speak the squirrel?I love a movie where you don't expect a villain to fall to death (well, there's a falling but it's an excuse for a hilarious twist), where action is more than an excuse for a succession of gags and laughs, where the 'serious' moments don't last too long, the film is a package of gags with the right running time, less than eighty minutes, but enough to leave you with a smile in your face. This is a film I would recommend to anybody, it's great and deserves more recognition.And take it from someone who hates to use the word 'underrated' but to call it underrated is an overstatement. It's groovy, but more than anything, it's funny.",9,2,5,22 December 2017
Blade Runner," As philosophically significant as '2001: A Space Odyssey' ...
","Ridley Scott recreates a cyberpunk dystopia with the same meticulous craftsmanship than Fritz Lang's 'Metropolis' and the alienating technology of the urban landscape is so dazzling that each single frame has a magical hypnotic effect, making 'Blade Runner' one of the few critically untouchable films on the simple basis of their artistry. Indeed, for a genre that relies on pure extrapolation in space and time, 'Blade Runner' is an iconic reference for both directors and art-designers, yet there's much more insightful themes to be covered. Through cloning, robots and extra-terrestrial expansion, Sci-Fi vehicles humanity's most existential quest: immortality, humans' control on their own creations or how much of God can they ever be. On that level, 'Blade Runner' is as philosophically significant as '2001: A Space Odyssey'. And like Kubrick's masterpiece, it's no surprise that 'Blade Runner' was also criticized for the slow pacing and relative absence of a plot. Speaking of my own experience, I didn't watch the theatrical version; I read that the voice-over narration was removed, so I can only judge on the basis of the Director's cut. However, remember my first feeling: as much as I loved the design, the artistic achievement, I was bored by the story and the lack of emotional connection between the characters. But I respected the film and its iconic status; I knew I couldn't dissociate the plot from the visuals since the action-less parts were clearly meant to be more introspective. After a third viewer, rather than an action-packed thriller, I see 'Blade Runner' as a meaningful examination of our own condition through the antagonism between humans and Replicants.The film opens with a written introduction, less stylish than 'Star Wars' but much more promising. It sets the action is Los Angeles, in 2019, where a powerful Corporation named from its head, Dr Eldon Tyrell (Joe Turkel), created a highly advanced form of engineered robots, equal in force and intelligence as any human being, known as Replicants, whose purpose was to contribute to the off-world colonization. But four of them rebelled and slaughtered all their vessel's occupants and came back to the Earth, where their presence is forbidden. The mission of the Blade Runner is to (as they say in their jargon), 'retire' them. The genius of the story is to use a plot of epic scope and instead of crossover between 'Westworld' and 'War of the Worlds' offers a darker and more minimalist tone, since only four Replicants are targets, still enough to root them in cinematic legend, each one unforgettable, each one perfectly casted.The Replicants are Pris (Daryl Hannah), Zhora (Joanna Cassidy), Leon (Brion James) and the leader and closest to perfection in his Aryan-like appearance is the emblematic Roy Batty (Ruthger Hauer). Leon is the first to appear during the infamous Voight-Kampff test: a series of questions meant to detect Replicants' flaws in the eyes. Although the eye-symbolism is omnipresent as eye is considered as the window of the soul, Ridley Scott doesn't regard the Replicants as soulless creatures. Tyrell's beautiful assistant, Rachael, played by a beautiful Sean Young as a dark femme-fatale, is the only self-ignoring Replicant since she was given an artificial memory materialized through a series of photographs in order to comfort her in that illusion. Rachael embodies the illusive Schumpeterian aspect of life, as a series of representations, something that only exists through our knowledge and stop when we are not. Is life only a dream, and we wake up when we die?The film follows the investigation of Harrison Ford as Rick Deckard, and the long quiet moments are invitations to meditate on these Replicants' conditions, and how different they are, from us. Ford is a good choice because he's precisely the kind of actors who doesn't need much to say or to do, to keep our eyes focused. Through Deckard, it's a whole universe we discover, the triumph of Asia over the world, the over-urban culture, but the soul of the film, belongs to one of the most cinematic villains: Roy Batty. Through his desire to be programed for a longer life, he represents our fight for immortality, our nihilistic escape from a certain death. Tyrell, like God, created men on his own image, but after being told that he couldn't live longer, Batty rejected the God that gave him life and pierced his eyes in one of the most brutal killings from any film. Batty stands for our rejection of God's gift for the gift of life has no value if it's meant to finish.Eyes are the windows of Batty's soul, many of these lines start with 'If you could see what I saw', as a desperate need for immortality through the posterity of his own experience. This leads to the poignant climactic monologue before he dies, where he spares Deckard' life so his own death would be witnessed, then remembered. Deckard survives from the will of the villain, and in a way, it's the villain who triumphs, because he'll be remembered, and because he embodies some existential torments we can all respond to, and that carry many film noir undertones like the fatality of an existence guided by forces no one can escape from, which also applies to Rachael, and naturally, to Deckard, himself.Now, is he or is he not? That is the question. What if my life started at the moment I wrote this review, with a sort of programmed memory, how could I be sure that I really lived my life. It's Zhora's snake biting his own tail  maybe the salvation relies on the present, an escape from the past and toward the future, a course between two never-existing points, that Deckard takes at the end, to join Rachael, his life or an unreachable meaning, leaving us through the iconic score of Vangelis, in our own interrogations and the feeling that there are still hidden meanings to be discovered in future viewings.",10,1,4,19 November 2012
Monsters University," They scare... but do we care?
","Monstres Academy (2013)
 The first 'Monsters Inc.' had an exciting premise both on a visual and story level, it created a parallel universe with monsters of various forms, designs, sizes and bodies: Mike Wazowsky (Billy Crystal) looked like an alien, James Sullivan (John Goodman) was a conventional grizzly-looking monster and then there were animal-like creatures like Randall Boggs (Steve Buscemi). The most 'fun' aspect of these monsters was less their differences than their similarities with us humans. So we had to see it to believe they were monsters and then came the whole plot centers on the Monsters, Inc., the door system and the encounter with a little girl named Boo. You know the story.The plot was simple although not devoid of a few contrivances here and there, but the charm lied in the simple things, in the sweet relationship between Sulley and Boo, something that felt like an early version of 'Masha and the Bear' and the friendship between Sulley and Mike, served by great vocal performances from Goodman and Crystal. The ending where they realized they could obtain the same energy power by making kids laugh instead of screaming was a nice resolution that only left as a cliffhanger the slight possibility or visiting Boo again, but that's not the approach the sequel took. 'Monster University' as its title indicates is a prequel to all the aforementioned events and answering to the questions that kept our mouth salivating for 16 years: how did the two monsters get their jobs? How did they become friends?There's a bit of sarcasm in my introduction but it's not mean to diminish the merit of the film, which can be summed up as great entertainment with a wonderful gallery of colorful and colored characters once again, driven by a plot so rich it's a real credit to the intellectual dedication of the screenwriters. This is perhaps its greatest blessing and its greatest curse. At first, I was just thrilled to see little Mike being too funny-looking and enthusiastic for his own good, we all know Disney movies have always been about believing in your dreams, but when our little green Cyclopes says 'I want to be a scarer', not only we don't take him seriously but we know he won't succeed, because we saw the first film.So we know it's not exactly the destination that will matter but the journey. I liked the journey but I didn't expect it to be so technical? So we follow Mike as a first-year student in the university, discovering his roommate Randall Boggs, following the scare program, having his first course in the amphitheater and undergoing the mockeries of more credible monsters and the popularity of Sullivan who belongs to a prestigious family of scarers, not to mention the no-nonsense authority of Dean Handscrabble, voiced by Helen Mirren. I could relate to Mike and the film is perhaps the first animated feature to realistically portray the universe of universities. It also had its share of action and it carries that 'underdog'' team aspect with the Oozma Kappa misfits and Mike being perfect in theory but not scary enough while Sulley relying on his looks like the hare on his fast legs. Still, I was surprised by the attention given to the contest, the graduation, being expelled or admitted. I liked the film but I wonder whether the script shouldn't have taken a much simpler and less convoluted path.The plot is well-written but a tad over-written, even if we accept that this is a universe that is exactly like ours (though it doesn't play with the same rules), it's just too grounded on a bureaucratic and institutional reality, too real for its own good. And it just takes for granted that because it's monsters, we'll get more excited by its series of twists and revelations. There are some great moments but they're lost in a double-character's arc that doesn't inspire much escapism or dream-like animation, something that really wows you at the end, it's fun, it's a nice buddy movie but maybe we got too blasé when it comes to animated pictures and it takes some really inventive material to blow you away. Grade 7, I guess it passes the test but it's one of these Pixar movies I wouldn't want to see again and again.",7,0,0,22 December 2017
Ben-Hur," The Tale of all Tales...
","In the ears and minds of any movie lover, the word 'Ben-Hur' resonates like the quintessential Hollywood classic oozing respectability in every inch of celluloid but the same respect we owe to an old relic. In our cynical modern world, who would enjoy a pompous-looking big-budget swords-and-sandals religious epic when you have Tarantino and Appatow?I saw 'Ben-Hur' for the first time in fourth grade, it was part of our history course and being an Asterix buff, I loved watching real-life legionaries, galley slavery not to mention the chariot race, the film also enlightened me on Christianity and on Judaism (when my only religious reference was monotheism number three) and scared the hell out of me with leper. It worked on a cinematic level as much as educational, I guess even in its TV-sized crappy 80's VHS look, we kids enjoyed 'Ben-Hur' especially the rivalry between Judah (Charlton Heston) and Messala (Stephen Boyd).I never watched 'Ben-Hur' after that but nor did I have any doubt over its status as a colossal masterpiece. Watching it again a few years ago and then a few days ago, I was surprised by how engraved in my memory 'Ben-Hur' was, and how the moments that stood out were still having the same effect. When Ben-Hur and Messala meet after many years, I'm always anticipating that first breech in the fortress of their friendship when the young Roman tribune will have one word too many about Ben-Hur's people, taking for granted their friendship and Judah's nobility as marks of submission. The second encounter is even more thrilling because it's like watching a shaking edifice waiting to collapse.It was a nice call from the director Wyler to mark the feud between the two ex-friends at the second encounter, hence putting more gravitas around their relationship, that screenwriter Gore Vidal tried to impregnate with homoerotic subtext. The story is known by movie buffs, Vidal wanted to make the interactions look as the two rivals were former lovers, the subtext works even more when you look at Stephen Boyd's 'enamored' eyes toward Charlton Heston. But 'Chuck' never knew the trick and was annoyed about it, I guess I prefer the way their hatred epitomize the conflict between Romans and Jews sealing as one of the most memorable rivalries in history of cinema, with the most heart-pounding climactic face-to-face (or should I say wheel-to-wheel).I had positive feelings about 'Gladiator' but 'Ben-Hur' is the masterpiece that dwarfs any contemporary masterpiece, a sweeping revenge story that doesn't rely at all on fake CGI and special effects. It took William Wyler's expertise built up in three decades of experience to make 'Ben-Hur' equal the reference of the time that was Cecil B. De Mille's 1925 version. As a matter of fact, 'Ben-Hur' has been blockbuster material from the start, ever since Lewis Wallace's best-seller of the late century, it was played on theaters and not with modest budgets. A revenge story, with galley combats, a chariot race and an oblique take on the greatest story ever told, with a hero going from idealism to anger, from revenge to love, all wrapped up in a subtle religious conversion, 'Ben-Hur' was an instant classic Hollywood couldn't ignore.If 1925 had the race and the thrills, the 1959 one had a bigger scope, bigger budget, the colors, the talking and all the determination of a big studio like MGM to prove a 50's audience that TV wasn't yet the pinnacle of spectacular entertainmnet. When I hear my Dad talking about going to the movies, like 'Ben-Hur', 'Spartacus', 'Guns of Navarone' or 'Taras Boulba' you would think he went there, inside the screen. And right now, I can't imagine the eyes of people staring at the screen during the chariot race, there comes a moment where you stop watching the moment as a plot element, but as a real race, and it never, never suspends your disbelief, it's like at any new viewing, Messalah can finally win.There are so many classic moments that filled the three-hour-and-half journey that you're never in a state of non-anticipation, when the new inquisitor's parade starts, you keep an eye on that loose roof tile, the one that started the whole chain of events. In the desert, you wait for the 'greatest cameo ever made', in the galleys, the big fight and Ben-Hur rescuing Arrius (Jack Hawkins) and it goes on and on. I must reckon after the chariot race, the film gets a tad too long, but only because you can't just sweep off such a rich epic with a five-minute resolution, and Charlton Heston, in his greatest role, contributed a lot to the everlasting appeal of the film, I don't think he gets the credit he deserved, he brings to his Judah Ben-Hur a dimension of emotional vulnerability that could have been laughable from a lesser actor.Other cast members include Oscar-winning Hugh Griffin enjoying his role as Arab sheikh and Judah's mentor, Israeli actress Haya Harareet as Esther, Martha Scott and Cathy O'Donnell as Judah's mother and sister... the film is served by a solid cast, editing, directing, having swept off all the major Oscar by breaking the record of 11 wins, only to be matched in 1997 with 'Titanic' and 'The Return of the King' and oddly enough, these titles could somewhat apply to 'Ben-Hur'. I haven't seen the 'original' and I'm in no hurry for the remake, but I don't get I'll be in a minority if I say that this is the ultimate version. I didn't see it many times in my life but it's always present in my memories as if it wasn't about the number of times you watch it but the intensity of each experience. And let's not forget the name of the director: William Wyler who outdid himself by making his masterpiece, which is saying a lot, given his previous streaks.'Ben-Hur': A Christ Tale, a tale of vengeance, in fact a tale of all tales...",10,23,28,4 January 2018
Toy Story 3," Iconic Disney Toys Finally Confronted to the 'Circle of Life'...
","As the most anticipated animated film of 2010, 'Toy Story 3' fulfilled everyone's expectations, crossing the billion mark, topping the box-office above notable champions like 'Alice in Wonderland', 'Harry Potter' and 'Inception', while the rest of the Top 10 was crowded with the other animated contenders as 'Shrek IV', 'How to Train Your Dragon', 'Despicable Me' and 'Tangled'. 'Toy Story 3' became the all-time most successful animated film before being dethroned by a freezing princess in 2013 and one of the few sequels and animated movies nominated for Best Picture. But it doesn't take the highest IQ to figure out that the third opus of the 3D saga couldn't possibly fail. The 'Shrek' franchise was getting out of breath, 'Tangled' had a better story than marketing management but 'Toy Story 3' had everything, the title, the characters and the sentimental value. After one decade, kids who've watched the first in the theaters were ready to be taken back to their childhood memories, and those who weren't even born in the 90's knew the movies from the DVD and merchandising so the film could count on a wide audience. That is to say, if I was the CEO of Pixar, I'm not sure I would have given a raise to the marketing manager for all that.Now, to the story: in the first, we were discovering toys through their sacred relationship with their owners; the sequel carried more existential undertones: Woody took pride in being a valuable item because of his rarity, while Buzz realized he was only one article among thousands of others. But in the end, it came down to their value as Andy's toys. Still, the introduction of Jessie left one important point suspended, Jessie belonged to a girl who ignored then abandoned her when she grew up, and in a way, by ending up in Andy's room, they were only getting a suspended sentence. When 'Toy Story 3' opens, Andy is a young man preparing to go to college and assigned the difficult task to get rid of his toys.We saw that coming and the scenario is quite simple: donation, attic or trash? Only Woody is privileged enough to be packed with the college stuff, as Randy Newman would say 'he's got a friend in him', but all the others (including Buzz Lightyear) are put in a garbage bag although Andy meant to take them to the attic. Unfortunately, the mother bumps into the bag before Andy comes back and she puts it near the trashcans. Woody manages to slip from the box and save his friends who are then taken to Sunnsyide, the daycare center. The toys are convinced that it was the right choice although Woody tries to convince them that Andy didn't want to abandon them. Anyway, the reception they receive in Sunnyside announces the sunniest future indeed.Lotso, the Teddy-Bear chief Toy welcomes the newbies, with the demeanor and reassuring voice of an old patriarch, his crew includes a creepy baby doll walking like the Frankenstein Monster and Ken. Ken who? Well, Ken the Barbie-gay, I mean guy. I wish it didn't take me six years to finally see 'Toy Story 3' because I knew already about Lotso being the villain, so I knew there was a catch behind his friendly tone and Vito Corleone father-like personality. I'm not sure I would have seen it coming in the theater, not even expected that Lotso would be the worst antagonist of the entire trilogy.So, I kept waiting for the catch and it didn't take long to show, these plastic bastards put them right in the younger children section, and being the father of a three-year old girl, I know the evolution of behavior that goes from the age of two to three and seeing our beloved toys, being licked, hit, thrown on the wall by children was the closest thing to a torture a Disney film could get. It was sad enough to see them put in a garbage bag, but they had to go through this, and this wasn't over yet. Buzz is put in demo mode and recruited as a guard while they are imprisoned in the room and the whole center is managed like a concentration camp. The only way out is the dumpster.'Toy Story' was about friendship, the second, existence and the third, martyrdom. Even the antagonist had reasons to be angry and cynical, accidentally left by his owner's parents, he was shocked to see that she immediately replaced her. Something snapped. Of course, this issue was already tackled in the second film, and the likeliness of being thrown somewhere is supposed to upset us. But 'Toy Story 3' goes as far as possible and I seriously don't use the word 'concentration camp' lightly, because the moment where all the beloved toys are about to be thrown in the fire, and for the first time, they were powerless, and all they did was to hold their hands and waiting for death to come, was like watching the Holocaust of Toys.I must say that was perhaps the most intense climax I've ever seen in a Disney film, and I heard so many things about it being an upsetting tearjerker that I thought that would be the end, no kidding. Well, I'm glad they kept that ending but God. Andy realizes that the sentimental value of his toys depend on their current utilization as much as their past, kids in school can play with them, but there's 'playing ' and 'playing'. We get the nuance when Andy gives all the toys to the little girl who loves toys and perhaps that emotional hesitation before he finally gives Woody is the film's emotional highlight. For the first time, there's a voluntary separation between the two partners, it's an end of era but also a new starÂ… indeed, the good old circle of life, also affects toys.",8,0,1,25 September 2016
Trainspotting," Some people never go crazy. What truly horrible lives they must lead...
","This is from 'Barfly' which is to alcohol what 'Trainspotting' is to heroin. This would make a helluva tag-line for the British cult-classic, but I'm not sure the feeling would last. Sepaking for myself, the worst toilet of Scotland is such a nightmarish vision it cured me from any temptation. Yes, I would keep my horrible life if it could spare me the use of laxative suppositories (I'm the type to cover the bowl with toilet paper before sitting).Being less than a decade younger than most of the cast, I can say the word 'drug' belonged to my dictionary since childhood, I didn't know exactly what drugs were but that was the point, I wasn't even supposed to try to know. Even my favorite kids' magazine dared to employ the S-word to describe drugs. It came to the point that I avoided cigarettes like the plague because I thought the first one magically started the addiction. Well, it wasn't far from truth either but I wouldn't have tried to check if this also stood for drugs, well, not heroin anyway. That's just to say heroin (or cocaine) is the ultimate interrogation mark and I owe most the answers to movies. I guess 'Trainspotting' stands in the Top 3 behind 'Requiem for a Dream' and 'Panic in Needle Park'.Things I learned about heroin from movies: there are two feelings when you're into them, one that transcends your highest perceptions of orgasm, and when the effect is over, the need for more drugs. Dependence and pleasure, that's the cycle of addiction. And having stopped smoking two years ago, I know how it feels to be dependent, you only wait for the next cigarette and everything is structured around drugs, in fact around addiction. And this is what Danny Boyle's directorial debut is about, the structuring effect of drugs in one's life and the alienating effect from the others' lives. The film sets the tone with its opening sequence featuring the three protagonists running in Edinburgh streets, why and where they run to isn't significant, it's all in Ewan McGregor's speech.The opening monologue could have been delivered by Tyler Durden in 'Fight Club', an ode to anarchic freedom devoid of greedy impulses, the independence from the diktat of fashion, consumption or the whole baloney about having a regular life, family, kids etc. The merit of this scene is double: it has the honesty to say that once you're in drugs, you don't really care for the norm, in fact, you can't care. The second is to grab the viewer from the collar and take him into this journey with a promising and catchy soundtrack that made the film one of the most emblematic of the 90's (hell, they even included Dance Music), the whole things feels exhilarating, cool and young. And you know what this immersion reminded me of? Martin Scorsese's 'Goodfellas'. This is the kind of film that plunges you into an underworld with its codes, habits, or lack of, and the way their members look at the rest of the world, girls, family, law, and by the magic of the screen, make their lifestyle look almost (I say almost) appealing. Of course, organized crime has a slight edge what's with all the money, cars, suits, but in 'Trainspotting', there's this dilettante quality, this detachment combined with a camaraderie between those 'who know'. We wouldn't want to try, but if there ever was another way to get an idea of what their lives feel like, we would. That's the mark of great films: to make you part of an experience, following protagonists from start to finish and see what lessons they or you learned. And 'Trainspotting' benefited from a an A-list of unforgettable characters, who complete each other perfectly. Mark (Ewan McGregor) is the guy under the influence, oscillating between heroin and Diane, his heroin so to speak (Kelly McDonald's debut), he talks so many times about quitting that we stopped taking his motivation as a serious factor. Spud (Ewen Bremner) is the goofiest of the bunch but also the nicest, he also tries to settle down and find a job but I'm not sure I'd try an interview under the effect of speed. Tommy (Kevin McKidd) is the clean guy with a weird habit to shoot himself while banging his girlfriend and by shooting I mean with a cam, only once he'll try with a needle, and it will be one time too many (Karma is the bitchiest of all). And there's Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller) who talks about Sean Connery and overrated awards movies like a legitimate IMDb user. And in the obligatory anger management department, Begbie (Robert Carlisle) pulls a Tommy De Vito in every single scene he is. Whenever you watch his pretty head, you know there's trouble coming. This is 'Trainspotting' in a nutshell, it doesn't make drug look cool, like 'Goodfellas', there's a moment where everything falls but it asks more questions than it provides answers. Speaking for myself (well it's a personal review what did you expect?), I spend so much time on IMDb, I love chatting about movies, sharing stuff with fellow movie geeks and reviewing that I wonder if it's not an addiction.Indeed, I review whatever I see, and right now, I should be watching a film, but I've got to finish this review before, and tomorrow, I'll start the film after the review of 'Trainspotting' etc., IMDb won't have the same effect as heroin, but after these years, I can say IMDb won and structured my life. This is why you can't expect a 'total victory' in 'Trainspotting', only a series of new beginnings, new cycles and maybe this is the secret of its enduring appeal, when you finish it, you wouldn't mind watching it again, in case you missed something.",9,2,2,30 September 2016
Space Jam," Space Gem...
","To put it simply, 'Space Jam' is the twice successful revival of Michael Jordan and Bugs Bunny's career.At 33, Jordan was past his prime and his controversial retirement following the death of his father, for a baseball reconversion, prompted Warner Bros studios to find a new vehicle to a necessary come-back. Meanwhile, the Looney Tunes were a milestone of TV and pop culture, but in the 90s, Bart and Homer Simpson had stolen a big chunk of their thunder, they had to deal with 3D competition, not to mention the eternal rivalry with Disney. Warner Bros studios never had their Renaissance and they never really mastered the world of animated feature to begin with.It's interesting that we're comparing one real character, who was perhaps the greatest and most iconic Michael of the 90s, after Jackson, and animated characters, but who would reduce Bugs Bunny to ink and paint? (And Daffy too) The legendary stinker and wisecracker (who was drawn that way) was the animated embodiment of Groucho Marx with a cooler look, perhaps the animated hero with the most personality before Bart. As a matter of fact, he's so good that if the film had been about Bugs visiting the human world, it would have worked as well. But then we wouldn't have Porky, Daffy, Tweety and all the gang and that would have been a shame because say what you want about Disney, zaniness isn't its strongest suit.And when you see how animation can ruin even the best animated characters, take the 'Tom and Jerry' movies for instances, one should applaud the way the film respects the spirit of these old cartoons whose 'Merrie Melodies' theme have been one of the most instantly identifiable music for all generations, a real hymn to the Golden Age of animation and beyond. Even as a kid who grew up with MGM and Disney, I found an odd little charm in the Looney Tunes and if I preferred Donald over Daffy, between Mickey and Bugs, there was no contest. Remember when the two titan rodents met in 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit', equal screen time but who got the best line? Bugs!'Space Jam' is no 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' however, but not every animation and live action crossover film has this pretension. Directed officially by Joe Pytka (Ivan Reitman is credited as producer), 'Space Jam' is pretty straightforward in its marketing and since it decided to have a basketball player for the main role, it's obvious it didn't mean to sweep acting awards. But if Jordan is an amateur, his work is far beyond amateurish and the way he plays himself in a role that floats between two universes is remarkable. Working in a green screen and pretending to have interactions with some of the most beloved characters is a feat and his choice to play it straightforward as if he was mildly surprised is the right one, acting surprised might have put him in the way of his 'character' and be a total distraction.Once Michael gets in Looney Tunes' land, he faces the deal and learns he must coach the Toons to win a game against the Monstars, previously known as the (far less intimidating) Nerdlocks, small creatures who took their height and talent from other basketball icons: Patrick Ewing, Shawn Bradley, Charles Parker and Muggsy Bogues. So, there's not just Jordan's freedom at stakes but the career of four players and the whole future of the NBA jeopardized by an animated crook named Swackhammer and voiced by Danny De Vito. The plot is spiced up by two other characters who'd have nothing to do: Wayne Knight as an obsessed (almost enamored) publicist and Bill Murray playing himself as a guy who wants to have a shot at the game. That these characters end up serving purpose is a joke, but there's nothing better than a comedy that doesn't take itself seriously, it's all a matter of pay-offs.And that's the spirit of the cartoon. The animation looks like something borrowed from an ad for Sprite of Nike but the film has no pretension either to hide its marketing value, there's even a scene where Daffy reminds that they are property of Warner Bros and a few other comments involving copyrights and 'take that' nods to Disney. The film makes money through sponsors with the same wit than 'Wayne's World' product placement but that's because everything is a product placement when you have characters not with names but brand names. But Jordan brings life to what could have been a dull and average performance and instead of showing off as the player with skills, he only becomes the guy who has fun playing with toons, avenges Tweety, act like a coach or a toon. Anyway, he's having fun and so are we.The film has an enthusiasm that is communicative and catching and reminds of these times when everything was simpler even in its corniness, Jordan may not be the best actor but he's a presence as valuable as the other giant and he doesn't even try to overdo it, and it works, everyone plays his part perfectly and that goes for Bill Murray too. There's no message, no patronizing statement, though the human story carries a few drama elements and one can't ignore how magic and transporting 'I Believe I Can Fly' works. Another 90s gem at a time where R. Kelly was still popular.Still, even if the film grossed a quarter billion dollar, it didn't have the same lasting success like a Disney blockbuster or its obvious counterpart 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit', maybe that's the limit of the marketed silliness, at the end, it lacks the universal touch, the timeless value, the fairy dust. Even the character of Lola Bunny was an interesting addition but a Jessica Rabbit she wasn't. It's certainly a pure product of the 90s, an era I'll forever cherish, my teen years, but it's a product nonetheless.That's all, folks!",7,4,6,23 January 2020
La Vie En Rose," The Emotional Story of a Sparrow of Ill Omen...
","There's a French expression to describe an abrupt and disconcerting shift between two opposite emotions, it's 'emotional elevator'. Well, as far as emotionality goes, Olivier Dahan's 'Le Vie en Rose' doesn't feel like an elevator, but like Russian mountains, so exhaustive it transcends the 'biopic' format. We don't discover the life of Edith Piaf, but her feelings, through her songs, her tragic love stories, and naturally, through Mation Cotillard's extraordinary performance, that swept away (and deservingly so) all the major acting awards in 2008.What a performance indeed, so intense and heart breaking, I kept on questioning myself, on which field Edith Piaf was the better at: singing or loving? 'Love, just love', she said, to an interviewer's question on the most important thing in life. And she would never have been half the artist she was if she didn't inject the very passion that drove her short life. She celebrates her centenary today, but she didn't live half of it, yet her legacy is immense. She's still the artist with this loud, powerful and clear voice, this giant of French music, despite her being two inches shy of five feet. But the loving and beloved singer had too gigantic a heart in such a small frame.Yet that voice, that diction that she learned the hard way, and allowed her to sublimate the alliterative 'Non Je ne Regrette Rien' testimonial song ('I Regret Nothing') transcended her frail body, as if all the strength Edith was blessed of was in that heart, and the voice that expressed it. When Edith sung, everyone was silent, because you can't listen to anything else when she sings, except the beating of your own heart, or an inner voice humming 'La Foule', 'Milord' or 'Padam' melodies. Like love, singing is all a matter of communication and that's what Edith Piaf knew the best, communicate her feelings. And Dahan's gutsy directing knew how to communicate this ability.There's a very well directed scene where Edith Piaf is about to perform her first song at the Olympia (Bruno Coquatrix's emblematic music-hall that she would miraculously resurrect in the early 60's, at the expenses of her health). Edith is first stricken by stage fear, literally frozen, then she goes and what happens is similar to the moment where she sung 'La Marseillaise' after her father's sidewalk number failed. It's a revelation, and from that moment, a star is born. And this epiphany is simply magical, we don't hear the singing; it's all expressed through Cotillard's gracious and poignant body language, and surprisingly, we feel the music. It's as simple as that.This moment allows Marion Cotillard to showcase her talent and push it into higher and higher summits. She's not just impersonating a singer, she's not just lip-synching, she just totally dissolved herself into Edith Piaf. Rarely has there been female performance that met with such unanimous critical acclaim and for reasons. Cotillard makes you feel the exhilaration and pain for having entrapped her soul into such a larger-than-life character, a person whose infinite capability of lovingness ultimately destroyed her. And one scene captures this tragedy, the scene that probably locked Cotillard's chances to win the Oscar, and the other awards.Edith Piaf had many lovers, but one stood above the others and formed a legendary pairing, as he was a legend in his own field, boxing. His name was Marcel Cerdan. The day before his untimely death, Piaf is in a state of grace, the culmination of her happy days, but she's a vehicle of emotions that can only be fueled by love, and she needs her Marcel so badly she implores him to take the plane. The morning after, her friends come with bad news. Of course, I'm not sure it happened just as the movie suggests; with the first hallucination of Marcel coming back, but that long shot covers a wide range of emotion, stages of grief escalating, to culminate with her heart-wrenching cries and ending with her iconic tribute to the man she loved the most, the 'Hymn to Love'.That four-minute shot encapsulates Piaf's life was about: a few moments of joie de vivre meant to end as tragedies. So much for 'la Vie en Rose'! From her raising by a singing prostitute Titine (Emmanuelle Seigner) and the devastating way, her father (Jean-Paul Rouve) snatches her away, from her miraculous encounter with Louis Leplée (Gérard Depardieu) while singing in a street with her friend Momone (Sylvie Testud) to the assassination of this man, the one she owed everything to, starting with her 'little sparrow' nickname. And the sparrow became the bird of ill omen held responsible for Leplee's death. Edith Piaf was a carousel of contradictions.It's extraordinary that such an immense artist never had a biopic, but I think I can figure out why. First of all, her life was so emotionally rich that even watching a documentary about Edith Piaf is enough to make your heart melt. And to play Edith Piaf, one must be pretty sure of his casting. Cotillard is nowhere near 4 feet 8, her beauty is more Hollywood-like than Edith yet she was so intense, so excessively passionate that she became Edith, it took the greatest actress to play the greatest singer. And Cotillard was born to play it. Speaking of birth, she named her son with Guillaume Canet, Marcel, as to keep something of Piaf's sparkle forever connected with her life. Of course, there are many chapters missing from Piaf's life, but it's just like the film embodied the tragedy of a woman too frail to carry such a gigantic heart, even a movie couldn't contain all the emotionality that cemented the tragedy of Edith Piaf. So, as Edith Piaf would say, there's nothing to regret, the film is as great as it is. And it has almost everything to do with Mation Cotillard's performance.",9,0,1,19 December 2015
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Behind every great lover, there's a city...
","In 'Vicky Christina Barcelona', Woody Allen reinvents the notion of schools of loves through the conflicting visions of two friends in their early 20's, visiting Barcelona for the first time.
Rebecca Hall is Vicky, the sensed and practical one, she's no less romantic than the average girl but she has loving rhyming with living, she takes love seriously and so her coming marriage with Doug (Chris Messina) a young junior manager who, if not the fire of senseless passion, doesn't lack the promising capability to be a good 'provider'.
Scarlett Johannsson is Christina, the passionate Ying to Vicky's wise Yan, she's an idealistic woman who envisions love as a sort of omelet that doesn't go without breaking eggs, there must have a good deal of suffering and hurting, proportionally to the heights of passions to be reached. She didn't find the true love, but she's still at an age where questions have the edge over answers. And it's interesting how their occupations reflect their personalities.
Vicky is a linguist who came to Barcelona to study Catalan identity, Christina is an aspiring director or photographer, an artist to make it short. The two girls have fundamentally opposed views on love, but they won't amount to much in Barcelona, the third side of a fascinating love triangle. After having romanticized the Big Apple and then deconstructed its romantic myth, coming totally full circle with his cherished hometown, Woody Allen embarked on a European trip in the early 2000's and the halt in Barcelona was certainly one of the most notable and inspired. 
With three dozens of movies on the clock, Allen sure acquired a unique talent to make a city feel alive through the film, and with the Gaudi signature, the cathedrals and the restaurants open at midnight, we know it's a matter of time before any convictions is swept up by the romantic mood of city. Indeed, with a town like Barcelona in the backdrop, half a Casanova's work is done. And when Javier Bardem as Juan Antonio comes and proposes the girls a little trip to Oviedo, granted he embodies all the suave charm of the Spanish lover, but he's like endorsed by the hypnotic beauty of the city. 
It's an old trick many womanizers apply, at a time where you had to cruise and be charming on the spot, not behind a screen, they generally went to the spot flourishing with tourists. Any lady-killer could stroll in Paris in Luxembourg Gardens during summer, a free visit to an English tourist enamored with the city would be the kind of proposals that'd rarely encounter a 'no'. But while Vicky can see behind the game and Christina just get in the flow, and before we know it, the 'no' became a 'yes'. Not sure the trick would work in America with all the sexual harassment talk but in 2008, everybody found it romantic ... so it's not just a matter of geographical context.
The trip doesn't follow exactly the trajectory we expect, or maybe it does, but just take a little detour, allowing the complicity to blossom between Juan Antonio, the tormented artist and Vicky. Juan Antonio had struck Chrsitina's attention because of some backstory about the conflicting relationship he had with his ex-wife, but the character he shows to Vicky is oddly matching her own approach to life and art, to the point that her attention toward her fiancée gradually slips. 
The trouble with cities like Barcelona, cities with a soul, is that you can't tell to which extent they influence your perceptions. Does Vicky appreciate Juan's company because she's in the perfect context for that, holiday, summer, relaxation or is the attraction genuine? To complicate things a little, her fiancé comes, to celebrate a first wedding in Spain, while Juan gets back to Christina. Something very interesting happens then in the mind of Vicky, that doesn't need any fancy analysis, it's summed up in one exchange: Juan says she and her fiancé are made for each other, and in a typical Allenian move, she's offended.
Why is that serious relationships or ambitions that imply steady comforts are perceived as negative? To the film's defense, this is not what 'Vicky Christina Barcelona' advocates, it does provide a nice glimpse on Spanish Bohemian life and I don't know anyone who wouldn't be tempted to live with a glass of wine everyday, painting and making love or living in a ménage a trois. In the very context of the film, it is appealing, but the antidote is clearly provided by the fourth and most memorable character of the film, Penelope Cruz as the ex-wife. Earning her an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, this is not just a credit to her talent but to her weight in a rather lighthearted film.
Before her entrance, the film made an effort to portray Juan as an attractive man and men like Doug as boring and 'knowing nothing about passion' and only leading to failing and hypocritical couples such as the one formed by Chris Dunn and Patricia Clarkson.. If the film doesn't strike for its subtle characterization (Allen generally excels in this game even for minor characters), at least it provides a character who's so passionate you just want to take the next plane not to New York, but to Alaska. As Maria Elena, Penelope Cruz plays a jealous, envious, suicidal, possessive, luscious woman, who takes art to a level of destruction and destruction to the level of art, to the point that what starts like a sensual adventure with three people finally prompts Christina to pull herself together and leave.
It is a credit to Allen for not having surrendered to a total triumph of passion over reason, the ending suggests that when it comes to love, nothing is really what it's all cracked up to be and sun is always sunnier in the other side of the Atlantic, especially under the sky of Barcelona.",8,2,2,25 January 2018
Sweet and Lowdown," Proof (once again) that no one should take Woody Allen too seriously, as he doesn't himself...
","... and that's the mark of geniuses.Now seriously, how come I never heard about Emmett Ray? I might not be a 'jazz aficionado', not 'Woody Allen' level anyway, but I humbly believe I would be aware of the existence of the second best guitar-player in the world after Django Reinhart (the film's running-gag). But then again, I gave 'Sweet and Lowdown', Allen's half-drama half-documentary musical biopic, the benefit of the doubt, after all, if I was familiar with Django yet incapable to tell you the name of one of his titles, it was all the more plausible not to be familiar with the second best.So, I started the film and I was immediately hooked by Emmett, the character, here's a guy whose eccentricity is displayed before his talent. He's played by Sean Penn using his whiny worn-out voice of the guy who doesn't try to disguise his lack of huskiness, he's got the most original haircut, the most stylish suit, he's a womanizer, even a bit of pimp, and while everyone's waiting for his performance, he's playing pool, having a few drinks and talk with one of his protegees. Call it the 'Amadeus' syndrome but his eccentricity is so flashily displayed that there's no way to believe this guy isn't talented. So he meets the public and starts playing and although I'm no expert, I thought I slightly recognized the first theme he played, which seems to have been borrowed from a very popular French ballad.That should have given me a hint, but no, as the plot advanced, no matter how weird things got, I didn't see it coming, Emmett was too original not to be real. So I believed the story about the moon, I believed that he met a mute girl and lived perhaps his longest and sweetest romance before getting back to his old habits and dumping her. I believed the love story with the wannabe writer, the marriage, the adultery with a bodyguard and it's not until the final act, that I had enough of bizarreness, I had to check. Because I have a bad habit, before watching a biopic, I like to check the basic details, you know birth year, death, the 'how' and 'why' etc.I wanted to pause the movie and see when Emmett Ray died, was it in the 30's so I might expect some depression, suicide or assassination or what? So, I google his name and found out he was a fictional character, I couldn't believe it. I didn't even suspect that after 'Zelig', Woody Allen would strike again in a jazz-related documentary. I swallowed everything, I mean you have Woody Allen talking passionately about his kind of music and many jazz experts debating on the veracity of some details, and come on, the second best guitar player after Django. It's all fake but I guess I'm too stubborn to accept it..Woody Allen makes a 'Spinal Tap' like film, and while the jazz player doesn't exist, jazz does, the Great Depression did, these kinds of people too, and these fans of jazz, you better believe they're tangible. So why not exploring the heritage of jazz and reinvent a world that would feel like a kaleidoscope of the environment that made a music like jazz the only possible enjoyable one. By choosing a fictional character, Allen allowed him to be grander and more original and appealing more than any real jazz-man. Emmett Ray knows how to get women but not to keep them, he has no social skills, no sense of commitment or of money but his talent is all he's got and when he doesn't play his guitar, he's regressing. This is how music is important to him. It's all about the music.And it's also very fitting that the girl he loved was mute but not deaf, she has an access to his talent, she knows what she loves in him and she allows him to be natural but she can't step on his territory, he has a freedom of total expression, and leaves her when his heart is being progressively tamed. He's an artist, so wrapped up in his conviction to be an artist that he can't afford to live a normal life. It's like the musician inspiring Allen and Allen inspiring the musician, a sort of Jekyll and Hyde duality. And both Sean Penn and Samantha Morton are excellent in their respective performances showcasing the natural harmony between the zany yin of a lunatic doofus and the quiet and benevolent yang of a patient understanding women. We love Emmett through Hattie and despite Emmett. And because such a sweet gal like Hattie loved him, we give him the benefit of the doubt.The second relationship should have told me something wasn't right, Uma Thurman played Blanche, the writer whose goal is to write about men with fascinating occupations, and she's so different from Hattie that Emmett keeps her like an obvious trophy-wife and if there's ever one thing Emmett cherishes more than his guitar, it's his ego, so it's all come naturally until she finally cheats on him looking for a wilder escapism with one of Emeett's boss bodyguards. I guess Allen went overboard at the end so that the only idiots who didn't know it was fictional could finally realize they were played with but this part had the merit to have a funny punch-line, one that couldn't do without a cameo of Django Reinhart.Emmett then vanishes after a few hit records, and there's nothing left about him, but who knows maybe there were many Emmett-likes who wanted to be the next Django, we can't be sure that such a larger-than-life never existed and Woody Allen's false tribute to a fictional jazz player becomes the magnificent tribute of a real art.",8,0,0,25 August 2016
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," Elizabeth in Love...
","In my review of the 1998 'Elizabeth', I said that it was more than your average costume drama since it had more to offer than the  well, costumes to begin with, and the usual antechamber plots, dizzying castle shots and climactic outbursts of blood. It wasn't the most original comment but I'm even more partial to it after watching the sequel of nine years later.Shekhar Kapur's first film was about the rise to power and the tactically efficient ascension of a courageous woman who stood tall against the Catholic establishment at a time it was still having a wide influence over British citizens. She defeated the odds by becoming the second Protestant sovereign of Britain, a captivating conquest from a heroine who, by cinematic standards, was an 'underdog'. Her climactic purge was a Machiavellian masterstroke often compared to the Baptism Massacre of 'The Godfather', not the most unflattering comparison.In 'The Golden Age', we meet Elizabeth again and she's not an underdog anymore, if she was Rocky, it would be the third: she's the Queen, as majestic and imperial as ever, but a bit too comfortable and accessible given her regal aura. I didn't mind it at the beginning and thought it fit the film's subtitle. But at the end, I wasn't sure I would give it the same compliment than the first film. It is entertaining and there's not a single bad performance, but there's a spice lacking somewhere. Like instead of dealing with the 'uneasy the head where lies the crown' trope, the focus was located this time a bit lower than the head, and maybe, just like Balboa, Elizabeth got too 'civilized' for her own good.The Queen is in a zone of comfort indeed, smiling, laughing, throwing a few winks to Bess, her first lady-in-waiting (played by the distractingly beautiful Abbie Cornich), making naughty jokes about her virgin status despite the zealous and formal insistence of Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush) to get her a husband. These parts tie the first act together and the sunny scenery, not to mention the magnificent art settings, make the whole thing a real visual delight. The problem is that these frivolous trivialities, rather than being the quietness before the storm are in fact the machinery structuring the whole first act, which makes the entrance of Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen), supposedly one of the film's highlights, more problematic.Let me explain this: Owen is an extraordinarily charismatic actor, a man's man with a real presence, so instead of seeing in Raleigh the explorer who conquered a land he named Virginia in the name of you-know-who, who brought to England new resources such as potatoes, tobacco and gold, 'borrowed' from Spanish ships and not under their contentment, we see the dashing and dark brooding adventurer who immediately catches the eye of Cate Blanchett. We see the romance instead of the history, Elizabeth's heart-troubles contextualize the movie rather than the real problem 'out there', which is the rivalry with the most powerful Catholic country of the world: Spain. I wouldn't have minded an intimate angle if it wasn't so superficial, not to mention, historically inaccurate.There's even a moment where the bond is so tight between Raleigh and Elizabeth that he crosses the line of insolence without even coming close to reach Elizabeth's breaking point. This Elizabeth is so hypnotized by the achievement of Raleigh that she forgot about her greatest conquest: power, and belittled herself in a way I didn't quite expect. I guess these artistic licenses were too blatant not to be deliberate, a sort of narrative choice meant to create a bigger contrast between Elizabeth's sudden vulnerability and the dark and scheming confidence of Philip II (Jordi Molla), ominously contemplating the conquest of England. The Spanish king is convinced that he's on the right side of God's Law while Elizabeth is the prey of doubt and love-sickness.It's not an uninteresting parallel between emotional fragility and unshakable faith, but the portrayal of Catholics isn't subtle and tends to reinforce that awkward feeling of something Manichean going on. I don't mind the Spanish being the antagonists, from a historical standpoint, it was true but it's all in the treatment and 'Golden Age' is too busy trading the authenticity for a few romantic subplots that I found myself lost more than once. The film shows an Elizabeth who's contested from within and from the exterior, whose loyal Bess gets pregnant from Raleigh but even the less literate in History knows that the real deal is the big fight against the Armada and couldn't care more about Elizabeth's self-esteem and existential issues.Yet the screenplay didn't establish solid hierarchies between the subplots. Everything is handled as if it was the same matter of life and death, to the point that we never really identify the moment where she Elizabeth overcame her demons, which basically means the whole second act. We have to accept that 'what didn't kill her made her stronger' to get ready for the big finale. It is ironic that in all this castle soap-opera, the most interesting character's arc is Marie Stuart (Samantha Morton) whose story-line is handled in better clarity and concludes in perhaps the most beautiful and memorable scene.I was baffled to read that the film took liberties with history, while it had the perfect material: the Spanish Enterprise, the assassination attempts, the execution of Marie and of course the Armada whose climactic fight was too spectacular to elevate the film above conventionality, not that I believe Kapur tried to be unconventional. He was too busy making this visual ride that he forgot to stay focused on the few elements that made Elizabeth such an unconventional heroine.It's like Kapur was so carried away by the loss to 'Shakespeare in Love' that he wanted his 'romantic' Best Picture contender. The film was 'only' nominated for Best Actress and Costumes, not such a good idea, after all.",6,1,1,12 June 2017
The Deer Hunter," Journey Into the Depths of Hell ...
","It's the literal translation of the film's French title, which couldn't have been more accurate. While watching 'The Deer Hunter', Michael Cimino's Best Picture winning masterpiece, a deep melancholy submerged my body Â… yes, the pain I felt was quite physical as if I was exhausted from the hardship endured by those brave men, no superheroes, simple factory workers. 'The Deer Hunter' drowns you in an ocean of thoughts while you try to find out what are the right interpretations beyond the tears, the cheers and mostly, the thrills...The film follows a three-structured narrative starting with a long wedding sequence, reminding of 'The Godfather''s famous first act, only this time, the wedding is BEFORE the war, before the boys go to Vietnam, the wedding party is also a farewell-party. Cimino rightfully trusts our patience and proves like Coppola did, that a long opening sequence properly handled is crucial to introduce the characters and their relationships. And like 'The Godfather', the film sets a friendly and jovial mood only to make the following sequence, in contrast, more emotionally harrowing. Indeed, the second segment abruptly plunges us into the reality of Vietnam, the tragic heart of the story while the third act deals with the post-war trauma. The whole movie could be seen as an exploration of the devastating effects War has on peoples' lives: here, a group of friend from a small industrial town in America.I guess the significance of their Russian background relies on two elements, the most significant being the idea of fighting as expressing a sincere gratitude towards America, the land that welcomed their families, the land they were born in and enjoyed living in, simply their home, sweet home, this is not about patriotism but a certain idea of duty conveyed by a strong sense of morality, not corrupted by the urban way of life of major cities. The second element, is probably the exotic atmosphere: I really enjoyed the music from the wedding party, especially the closing Casatschock. I wanted to dance with Michael, Nick, Stevie, Stan, all these jolly fellows, all night long ... before the last hunting. Isn't the movie titled 'The Deer Hunter', after all?Hunting, in those pre-lobbies eras, had always been considered as one of the noblest human activities because of its deep roots in our heritage. It's the contact with nature that allows to contemplate and understand its beauty and wildness with respect. You don't kill an animal, you participate to a cycle started from the dawn of the age, when men and animals were fighting over dominating their environment, when killing was for survival, not pointless. And as a ritual honoring this noble philosophy, Michael, played by a spectacular Robert De Niro hunts with a serious and extremely sincere dedication... This seriousness is incarnated by his unforgettable 'This is This' speech delivered to the poor Stan, the late John Cazale in his last role. 'This is this' as the perfect harmony of things, each own assumes what happens to him, preys are preys, predators are predators, living requires a discipline so raw it's close to survival. This reasoning might sound extreme but for Michael, the rules of life are impeccably simple.Hunting inspires all the noblest manly sentiments, friendship, integrity, and respect. But this is only a setting, all these elements are explored beyond the limits of the mountain. Besides, this is an idealization, these guys, even Michael, enjoy drinking, arguing and making crude jokes. They are men of principles, faithful, but they're buddies more than anything. 'The Deer Hunter' is the ultimate male-bonding film incarnated by such memorable scenes as in the bar where they all sing along 'Can't Take my Eyes Off of You', one of my favorite musical moments ever. And the central relationship is between Michael and Nicky, a young Christopher Walken in his most powerful performances as the best friend, or maybe something more that I can't put my finger on, like a cloud of mystery floating somewhere in a sky, blue like Meryl Streep's lovely eyes. This friendship, as any other friendships, will be confronted to War, when Michael, Nick and Stevie, the broom, John Savage in a too overlooked performance, will be confronted to the iconic deadly game that immortalized the film, and gave it this iconic status. But more than a Pop Culture touch, the Russian Roulette is a powerful symbolization of War itself. It's having the gun pointed at you, with odds of survival getting lower and lower after each game. It's all a matter of luck, where the winner is not the guy who kills, but who let the other killed, and after such an experience, killing a deer strangely reminds you of your own condition as a human prey. In one scene, probably the most intense of cinema's history, we learn more about war and death than any other film, De Niro's greatest piece of acting, and a deserved Oscar for Walken.*** I will conclude by dedicating this review to the late John Cazale, who prematurely left this world after having portrayed weak and tormented characters with a heart-breaking authenticity. One of the images that will forever haunt me features Cazale as Stan, standing alone in the last scene as if it was the actor himself, visibly tired, who felt the song sung at that moment was his swan song, his personal good-bye to the cinema. But he couldn't have a better last film. And this is this ...***",10,0,1,12 May 2011
Saving Mr. Banks," In the Company of Disney (and the Shadow of Mary Poppins)...
","Walt Disney has become a brand-name invoking a world of perpetual enchantment and demonstrations of friendliness so over the top they can confine to a tyranny of smiles. That's a very cynical way to look at it but not too far-fetched. Still, as a father of a little girl and given how enamored she was with 'Frozen' and how she seems to enjoy the old cartoons I show her on Youtube, I can't deny that Disney (the man or the company) always had a way with children and pardon the cliché, the inner child in all of us.So it's quite fun to see the Walt Disney company producing a movie where all the archetypes of Disney would be disdained by a stuck-up British lady who's no one else but the writer of 'Mary Poppins', P.L. Travers played by a delightful Emma Thompson. It's also fun to see the one receiving these critics being good old Disney himself, played by Tom Hanks. He doesn't try to imitate Disney but 'Saving Mr. Banks' isn't intended to be a formal biopic about how the tycoon got the rights for what would become one of his most successful and iconic works.The film plays on a more emotional level, it is about two visions, two convictions that should have made Mickey Mouse and Mary Poppins walk hand-in-hand to contribute to a masterpiece (the poster is a perfect summary of the film on that level)... only it took twenty years. It was a promise made to his daughters that Walt Disney couldn't allow himself to break, make a film out Travers' classic 'Mary Poppins', but the woman, a stubborn Aussie, wouldn't have the glitter and the schmaltzy bliss of Disney tarnish the legacy of her book. She had a misconception, taking Disney for some modern-day Santa Claus but so did Disney by misunderstanding the woman and ignoring the sources of her inspiration, some tragic ones.The film offers many flashbacks of Travers' childhood during which we witness the fallout of her family, from the descent into sickness and alcoholism of her father, to the attempted suicide of her mother and a nurse that took care of her family when she was seven. Just like John Lee Hancock's previous film 'The Blind Side', the film seems very simple and straightforward until, you start to grasp a specific subtext. In 'The Blind Side', there's a moment where we clearly question the motivations of the Tuohy Family, if it wasn't just about football, and then this question is answered. In 'Mr Banks', we know Travers doesn't want any animation, any red color, but we quickly realize there's something else eating her.She wants Mr. Banks shaven, to be a good man, she has an obsession with Mr. Banks even more than the children or maybe Mary Poppins, the flashbacks centering on her well-meaning but unlucky father played by Colin Farrell allows us to reassemble the pieces of the puzzle and understand what the purpose of Mary Poppins was. There's a pattern in the film consisting on all the friendliest moments (and Travers is quite devoid of immediate warmth) involves a father or one invoking father's memories. Nothing Oedipal about it, it's just speaks about people who accomplished major works by translating the burden of their childhood into something positive.Of course, Disney's body of work is superior but there's no denial that Travers contributed to his most iconic creation, his first Best Picture nomination and a classic for all ages. We know 'Mary Poppins' will be made anyway, and the efforts of the Sherman brothers or Disney executive will pay off, but the film is enjoyable on the simple level of these interactions and the so conflicting mentalities of Disney, a cheerful man but astute businessman and a woman who's taking her book very personally. It's only after she realizes how personal it is to Disney that she finally trusts him... and the rest is history.",8,1,1,22 December 2017
Fantastic Mr. Fox," A Film Rich in Text, Texture, Subtext and Fur and Fun Mixture...
","Mr. Foxy Fox is voiced by George Clooney, but this isn't just some publicity stunt, Clooney has always been somewhat a foxy guy, handsome, clever in a funny way with a touch of darkness, when he says 'I'm just a wild animal', it sounds like something Clooney would say about himself. The actor is no Day-Lewis but he has always been good in that particular range of smooth-talking small-time crooks, whose looks and natural swiftness make him get away with everything except with the one who won't take it. Because, you know guys like Clooney or foxes have their weakest point, which generally coincides with the heart.Felicity Fox comes only one minute later in the picture. Before, we just saw Foxy warming up a little, he's at the top of his game as number one thief, and in what other job would a fox excel if not stealing? In this movie, animals' personalities are defined by their archetypes but Anderson, faithful to Dahl's spirit, always find a little twist, a way to play with it rather than being chained to it. And the whole tonality of the film indicates that this is a rather adult-oriented movie. Indeed Mrs. Fox comes from the doctor, a few minutes later, during a fox-trap situation; she'll reveal what we didn't dare to suspect. It seems like Fox is caught in a worse trap with no getaway except the promise to go straight.Meryl Streep has always possessed that homely, motherly authority and creates the perfect contrast with Clooney. Together, they form a more believable couple than any live-action movie. As a matter of fact, it's a miracle how Anderson finds the perfect tone between a ludicrous premise (style-wise) and the authenticity of his characters. His movie is set in a world where humans and animals coexist and seem to live within the same standards, except for one thing: humans have all the rights, they can raise, domesticate, kill and eat animals, this is the only Disney territory where Anderson ventures. But the paradox of anthropomorphic animals confronted to normal humans is one of the film's most creative bits. It's interesting though that the two worlds rarely share the screen.The film is based on the childhood rhyme about three mean men, Boggus, Bunce and Bean, one fat, one short and one lean, they're three farmers who mind their own business (poultry, duck raising and cider) before they're victim of Fox' robberies. With the help of their new house's attendant Kylie Oppossum (Wallace Wollodarsky), Fox steals from the three farmers and make mortal enemies out of them. The three men will know no rest until they get Fox, digging him out to the point that all the furry animals are forced to live underground and risk starvation. But foxes have more than one trick under their sleeves and thankfully, the plot doesn't just rely on a simple humans vs. animals antagonisms, there are a few demons to overcome within the animalistic characters and Anderson treat them sometimes with the same three-dimensionality than the people from his live-action movies.In fact, anyone familiar with Anderson's style shouldn't be surprised by the kinship with his films.Anderson is a director who cherishes static shots and linear movements, in perhaps the style that is the closest to comic-books than any other directors or maybe animation à la Hanna-Barbera. In the film, characters run like in the old Atari video games, and the digging looks exactly the same except in the vertical sense. We suspect that the 'artistic license' was also forced by a few budget restrictions and the fact that Anderson isn't an animator from the start, but he finds a way to transcend possible flaws and turn them into old-fashioned visual delights, as the lack of green and blue provided a nice autumnal sepia texture. The eloquence of the scripts makes up for the static moments, many times people talk without necessary looking at each other, which also simplifies the use of stop motions.Overall, the stop-motion gives a real edge to the film and is perfect for a movie centering on furry and funny characters, each fox has a unique design and fur complexion accentuating the realism (while the human characters are more ordinary looking with the help of CGI). The real thrill of the film comes from the various personalities, and they're surprisingly believable. A masterstroke of characterization is Ash (Jason Schwartzman), the teenage son (two years in fox years) who could have been a little brat or an awkward teenager, like any of the 'Incredibles' children, but he's a kid who lives in the shadow of his father, who's bullied because of his short height, who's everything his father is not, and who must suffer from the inevitable comparisons with his cousin Kristofferson, who's everything he's not. I never thought a movie would feature an archetype that has seldom been in movies: the perfect guy.After two Hayao Miyazaki's movies, which multiply the number of viewings by two to fully get the films' brilliance, my mind needed a rest. I pulled a Monty Python and said to myself: and now for something different. Yes, I needed to see something new, imaginative enough to challenge my perceptions but in a more soothing way. I didn't know what to expect exactly from 'The Fantastic Mr. Fox', but that ignorance was perfect, the film was exactly the medication I needed, I longed for something different and maybe the best compliment I can give to this Foxy adventure is that it's like no animated film I've seen before and like no animated film you'll ever see, from beginning to end. And one thing for sure, this Mr. Fox is indeed, fantastic.And as if ever needed, here's another offering that proves that Wes Anderson is as much an auteur as Miyazaki in the sense that he really invented a style, a form of storytelling that channels his own creativity, in total symbiosis.",9,0,0,30 July 2017
Speed," The cinematic shot of adrenalin that resurrected an agonizing action movie gimmick...
","The 70's had 'Jaws', the 80's had 'Die Hard' and the 90's had 'Speed'. What do all these movies have in common? An irresistible and unmistakable high concept: a uniqueness in the plot allowing other movies to be summarized by simple combinations, like 'Alien' is 'Jaws' in space, and 'Under Siege ' is 'Die Hard' in a boat. It's by the way an odd coincidence that the director of 'Speed', the unknown Jan de Bont was the cinematographer of 'Die Hard', he sure learned in the best school.So, 'Speed' relies on a simple concept: a bus can't slow down under 50 mph, otherwise, it explodes. Let me take a few lines because the wannabe screenwriter I am can't resist to the temptation of exalting such a high high-concept. I think, it's the kind of ideas that are worth at least half the work, I mean, imagine a producer being submitted such a project, how many spectacular premises does that hold? How about a traffic jam? What if a road comes to a dead end? How can the passengers leave the bus? How can they disarm the bomb? How can the villain make sure they can't take the passengers out? How will they be able to fool the villain anyway? etc. etc.Movies based on 'what if' situations are generally the best in the way they make you wonder what can happen next while you're already enjoying the present action, the enjoyment is doubled, and through a bus that can't go down 50 pm, everything is meant to happen fast, to put you on a constant edge. It was a no-fail guarantee and all 'Speed' had to deliver were the requirements of the action genre, and get us a memorable movie villain, Dennis Hopper is perfect as the young and maniac bomb expert Howard Payne, a cool hero, Keanu Reeves, a then relatively new face of action movies and a young Sandra Bullock who has this mixture of inner heroism and genuine fear, something our female-power driven era would deem as sexist (God I miss the 90's!).There is also Jeff Daniels as the more experienced cop, a script full of funny archetypal one- liners, and more than anything, a terrific plot structure. 'Speed' actually, could have only consisted on a bus chase and it would have worked, but it spices up the material and pushes the envelope of the action genre by introducing two other spectacular sequences, one introducing the villain, who installs a bomb within the cables of an elevator and threatens to make a dozen of innocent people fall to their death, and the climax that can simply be summed up as 'Speed' in a subway. I used to think that this was unnecessary, but when you think about it, 'Speed' doesn't just overplay the action card, it also bases itself on a simple third-act structure: introduce the villain, then the meat of the story, the heart-pounding bus ride and then the ultimate confrontation.'Speed' is like a great shot of adrenaline revisiting what was an agonizing action movie gimmick: the obligatory car chase. It would also inspire a less successful sequel with 'Speed 2: Under Control', and I think it's a bit unfair to dismiss the whole movie, it didn't work because it didn't have ambition but because the original had too much of it, so it inevitably paled by comparison. 1994 was a terrific year for movies and it's all the more fitting to have a groundbreaking movie in the action genre.That was a quick review, but if there's one thing I learned from 'Speed' is that sometimes, the faster, the better.",10,1,3,26 January 2016
Amélie," A cinematic treasure ...
","To the viewers who complained about the movie depicting a totally unrealistic non-multiracial Paris, I wanna reply with a big and long : 'Soooooo what ?' and here starts the review ...First, it's called ART. Which means it's something personal. A personal view from Jeunet which -I agree- has a very nostalgic 40's/50's feeling depiction of Paris with a sentimental focus on Montmartre, but again, why not? Why do you feel obliged to kill the joy of many viewers all over the world by adding a political 're' to Jeunet's 'vision' ... should Jeunet have artificially inserted some racial minorities in the background just to satisfy the PC supporters : 'Hey look, I'm not racist!'. Amelie is a piece of Art, and an artistic masterpiece. It may look fake or artificial or just weird, but for me it was just a dream-like realistic-fantasy world full of non stereotypical yet eccentric people like in Capra's movies. Secondly, Amelie is UNIVERSALLY appealing. It deals with universal themes all of us can relate to : nostalgia, childhood, quest for love, family, meaning of life, there's a gallery of characters so rich that everyone can relate to the situations they live, their simple pleasures, the things they like, the things they don't. Third point : it makes you feel so good.It's an incredible feel-good and poetic movie that doesn't have the typical depressing message some movies like to sell just because it became so cool to push people down. By the way, being a feel-good movie is not enough, Amelie works thanks to the innovative story, the director's creativity, the wit of the script, and the beautiful and enchanting cinematography ... not to mention the score that fits the movie like a glove. There's no cliché in Amelie, it was something totally fresh and new for its time. (As a comparison, 'Slumdog Millionaire' is a feel-good movie, but far lest subtle than 'Amelie' especially with the forced Fairy Tale ending and all the celebration : money, love, dancing etc.) Ironically, those critics came for the same country that produced the film ... it's an unfortunate tendency to over-analyze things, to put them on a very rational and political level : the movie was highly praised, even by racial minorities. Why? for all the reasons mentioned before : an entertaining artistic and popular movie, with a stunning cinematography, a great script, and more than that : a movie with a HEART, incarnated by Audrey Tautou's illuminating smile. But some people feel obliged to show how smart they are and try to analyze movies like a 'journalist' just to point out some things as if we hadn't noticed them before. And you have some French elitists bashing one of the most popular French movies, one of the greatest achievements in movie's history and one of the best ambassadors of French Cinema all over the world. 'Amelie' is such an inspiring movie, that invites you to forget today's cynicism, and enjoy the personal vision of the director, of the most beautiful town in the world, providing universal insights about the meaning of life ... Merci Jeunet for this cinematic treasure!",10,3,8,4 November 2010
Moonrise Kingdom," Meet Me in New Penzance
","The story begins in September 1965, in a New England Island called New Penzance. Two misfit and precocious adolescents run away from their family (or what stands for it). Sam (Jared Gilman) escapes from his Scout camp à la Dufresne and Suzy (Kara Hayward) sneaks from her house in a location named Summer's End. Scoutmaster Ward (Edward Norton) and Suzy's parents (Bill Murray and Frances McDormand) inform the Island Police Captain (Bruce Willis) about their concerned disappearance and it doesn't take long for the town's unique law enforcer to tie the two cases via a pile of incriminating letters discovered by Suzy's mother and indicating one year of romantic correspondence. A search party and police investigation is lead to find the two pen pals, and over the course of the movie, Ward's Commander Pierce (Harvey Keitel) and a nameless Social Assistant (Tilda Swinton) embark on the search. The whole wilderness turns into the backdrop of a thrilling cat-and-mouse chase and a penetrative romance; it has the set-up: a first encounter (told in flashback) at a church during a musical performance of Noye's Fludde, the romance on the lam the next summer, an improvised marriage in a Scout chapel, and a suicide attempt in the very church where they met during the infamous hurricane of September 5. I loved that Anderson used real events and real locations to give the film a touch of authenticity. I love his attention to little details, his capability to accessorize everything, from the record player with incorporated batteries, to the books brought by Suzy. Yet it's all fake and I was fooled.Anderson could have used any Scout camp, any location, any real book, any hurricane that happened in any year of the 60's, and fictionalized them. No, he recreated the camp, the books and more incredibly, the maps, no matter how painstakingly hard it would be, no matter that it would pass over many viewers. But that's the mark of a genius, he doesn't shape his inspiration according to the world, he creates his own world and his vision shapes our feelings.Indeed, as you get used to the process of watching movies, you take for granted that the film you're watching will plunge into a reality that might not be THE reality but will be stylized in such a way it will highlight the deepest aspects of your life, environment, troubles and the whole caboodle. But Anderson's movies in general and 'Moonrise Kingdom' in particular, elevate the term 'fictionalization' to the level of art by subverting it. Anderson doesn't care about reality, he creates his own, codifying it with the same known trademarks, long traveling, rectangular shots with characters literally sliding over the frame or exchanges of look where for one moment you feel like you're the observed one. Anderson's reality is stylish, eccentric and fake! But by being so evidently fake, it is enigmatically more appealing than any movie that will care for the opposite feeling. Today's film-makers are so obsessed about reality that's they're literally conditioned by violence and ugliness, they want to create eye-opening experiences but they ignore that there's a sort of defensive mechanism in the viewer's mind that tends to ignore what immediately reminds of reality. After all, the most important room in a house is the toilet but that doesn't mean we enjoy talking about it. Wes Anderson handles many painful subjects in 'Moonrise Kingdom' despite all the idiosyncrasies: he handles marital troubles, adolescence crisis, many characters are very unsatisfied with their life, yet with his 'mind software' he manages to translate it into a fabulous adventure and a hypnotic romance. The secret (I guess) is style. Wes Anderson is perhaps one of the few filmmakers whose stylish approach to a specific theme makes the movie, he never tries to touch the truth the way filmmakers are obsessed with, if he had made 'La Vie d'Adèle' he would have cared about the sexual tension rather than the sex (easily rendered by as many ass-shots as the lenses can take). His movies look staged and cinematic in a way that makes you contemplate the inner depths of the characters. All the characters of the film are like presences, looks, they're defined by their actions but the directing allows you to take a brief pause and there's just something in their eyes that either try to deliver a message or find an answer. The film relies on this alternation between movement and contemplation, and sometimes, we're contemplating a movement like the beautiful dance sequence with Françoise Hardy's 'Time of Love' capturing the awkwardness of an age where we can't really put words into things but we're fueled by a deep need for expressing something.Maybe that's why Suzy is so obsessed with books, incapable to find her own truths; she grabs as many pieces as she can and try to mold a positive mindset. Maybe she's the central piece to Sam's own puzzle of happiness and love. And the genius of the film is that the narrative progressively unfolds similar troubles into the adult characters, each one being driven by the same doubts and hesitations. Adults are looking after kids who're trying to escape from conditions they (adults) resent as well. Near the end, you realize that the postcard look of the film, the picturesque aspect, the old-fashion charm, the maps and even the books, have created a faithful reflection to realities more than any documentary. Anderson understood that people are ready to see reality through the glasses of fantasy, of fictitiousness. And it's because the film has so much to offer in terms of visual treats, the use of natural elements, storms, lightning bolts and boats are so great that we're ready to handle the sadness of their characters, it's a 'happy' film about unhappy people, one that puts the 'Art' in cathartic.",9,1,1,2 September 2017
The Sixth Sense," A Milestone for Psychological Thrillers and a Masterpiece of Suspense and Drama ...
","The amazing climax of the 90's have enriched our cinematic knowledge with extraordinary movies, from the immersion into a parallel universe named 'The Matrix' and the unforgettable heart-breaking 'Green Mile', to the powerful social commentary of the pre-millennium consumerist society in 'American Beauty' and 'Fight Club', not to mention the resuscitation of the legendary 'Star Wars' saga  and still, only one movie managed to get so rapidly and deeply rooted in Pop-Culture: M. Night Shamalayan's 'The Sixth Sense', one of the most memorable movies of the last 15 years.What makes this achievement even more remarkable is that 'The Sixth Sense' didn't use breakthrough visual effects contrarily to its contemporary films. It had quite a minimal cast, and a very sober directing, yet it managed to create a particular atmosphere that seemed to belong only to this new classic. I don't think any other horror film reached such a level of originality since the 1970's. Indeed 'The Sixth Sense' creates the reminiscent feeling of Friedkin's 'Exorcist' and seems to remind us how horror is one of the most likely movie genre to create unforgettable films, when handled correctly. I mention the 70's as the decade that preceded the slasher era which made gore so ordinary and laughable it killed all the purpose of a horror film, which is all about a psychological dosage of expectations and thrills. And this dosage works in 'The Sixth Sense' : there's a whole feeling that something is going to happen, yet it takes its time, time for us to get into those characters, to discover Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) the no-emotion child psychologist, and Cole Sear, the enigmatic kid who inherited a strange power, a sixth sense that looks more like a doom than a gift. The movie is renowned for a revelation featured in one of the most iconic quotes of the last 20 years, thus revealing this power is not necessarily ruining the premise of the film, but anyway, I will focus on the cinematic achievement aspect responsible of the extraordinary rebirth of the horror classic genre. And again, I think the comparison with 'The Exorcist' is relevant since the movie approaches the genre with a long build-up in an ordinary family house setting, which gives enough time to approach the characters and their background, so we can identify with them. And step by step, the supernatural elements are patiently introduced, with an efficient timeliness, leading us to an unforgettable climax.The supernatural elements are perfectly handled thanks to the amazing Oscar-worthy performances of Haley Joel Osment, as Cole Sear, the kid who's not a kind of know-it-all smart kid or a whining victim, but an innocent doomed little boy, Toni Collette as Lynn, the supportive mother who suffers from the torments of despair and powerlessness to help her little boy and her struggle to bring back some ounce of normality in Coles 'life is particularly heartbreaking. The mother and son relationship is the heart of the film when the dorsal spine is Dr. Malcolm Crowe's back-story with Bruce Willis in one of his most underrated out-of-character performances as a mysterious doctor who tries to help and assist Cole in this painful experience, which seems to be a two-ways therapy inhabited by a profound will of redemption. Carrying the whole narrative structure of the film, Willis' job looks like a psychological investigation, that gives a movie a sort of noir feeling and the film is an intricate puzzle that respects the audience's intelligence by letting enough hints to guide us to the climax but not obvious enough to decrease the sensational aspect of the ending. The last minutes, the last ten minutes of the film are so emotionally rewarding that you can't help but feel like watching it a second time. It's one of the few films where the experience of the first viewing is so harrowing you can't perceive yet the intelligence and cleverness of the script, only after a second viewing.The script is certainly the strongest element of the film, too often overlooked in other horror movies, here it works because of the realism of the dialogs and the directing that makes the story scarily believable. The film would never have been so memorable if it only relied on special effects and cinematography: the viewer can be fooled by what he sees, but fooling him with words, with verbal interactions, with actions, looks and silences is a challenge that have been successfully achieved by talented directors like the master Hitchcock ('Psycho' being the most obvious example) but the director was not Hitchcock, M. Night Shamalayan was a young débutant who would never have been thought to make a movie so iconic and so rapidly. Yet, if it didn't win the Best Picture Oscar, it definitely was the movie that impacted the viewers the most. No wonder 'The Sixth Sense' made it in AFI's Top 100, as a recognition of the significance of the film and the revolutionary aspect it had on cinematic storytelling by paving the way for movies with long build-up and spectacular conclusions, an impact, even the director could not match it with his later films.'The Sixth Sense' is a heart-pounding thriller like any other one has been made before. But don't expect countless deaths or disturbing gore, instead you'll have an extraordinary atmosphere, amazing performances and an intelligent script. Expect another viewing, expect some scary moments and some deeply emotional ones, and if you don't say a big 'Wow' at the end, either this film has been spoiled for you, either you're one of the most exceptionally intelligent people that doesn't get fooled by little cinematic hints. In both case, it's unfortunate without prevent you though from enjoyment, because 'The Sixth Sense' still works on the emotional level, thanks to the amazing performances of Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette.",10,0,1,13 February 2011
The Producers," So ... can we laugh about everything?
","On that question, one of the most notorious politically incorrect French comedians, Pierre Desproges provided the most overused answer: 'Yes, but not with everybody.' In other words, the most racist joke has to make a non-racist person laugh without creating a bond with a racist one. See? The distance between the content of his joke and its author must be evident. A bit oppressive isn't it? Or maybe we can all agree that humor essentially depends on the intelligence of the listener.With all its racism, sexism and inner vulgarity, the intelligence of 'The Producers' is that it works on a self-reflexive way as each joke might get the two sorts of reaction that the infamous 'Springtime for Hitler' inspired on the stage audience: a slack-jawed shock or cheerful applauds. But that's what the 'not with anyone' means in my opinion, you trust the intelligence of the viewer enough to believe he can see behind the laughs where your opinions lies, and that making fun of something is also part of a subtle exercise of self-derision.Was it really necessary to show Max Bialystock (Zero Mostel) and Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder) removing the Nazi armband, putting it in the trashcan and spitting on it. Maybe as a reminder of the Nazi's barbarity but I thought that bit sinned by underestimating our capability to read between the lines. Anyway, apart from that moment, 'The Producers' remains one of the funniest films ever made carried by the incredible Mostel and Wilder duo, 'The Producers' outshines whatever defined humor in the sappy 60's : it's outrageous, irreverent, naughty and so blatantly amoral that calling it 'politically incorrect' is the understatement of the century.'The Producers' pulverizes all the barriers of good taste with a daringness that flirts with genius in its incredible mix between a chaotic hysteria and a perfect comical timing. The scene where Leo Bloom frenetically screams 'I'm hysterical' before Max throws water on him and then shouts 'I'm hysterical and I'm wet!', the whole scene punctuated with so many unintelligible noises is some of the funniest pieces of comical acting ever made and maybe a landmark in comedy. When the water comes out of the fountain after Leo Bloom decides to have 'everything that's in the movies' feels like exultation, an orgasmic liberation from every principle ruled by the movies through a hilarious hymn for selfishness and greed.The selfish and greedy one is Max, influenced by his new accountant and future accomplice, he decides to raise money to produce a flop in order to make the greatest benefit. The most likely play to flop, is a musical comedy about Hitler, a 'love-letter to Hitler' written by a manic Nazi nostalgic wonderfully played by Kenneth Mars. And to be sure the play will fail; they take the worst director of all the showbiz, Roger De Bris, played by Christopher Hewett. It's a real delight to see Otto from 'Malcolm in the Middle' and 'Mr. Belvedere' in such hilarious performances, 'The Producers' is served by a wonderful gallery of supporting performances where everyone has a moment to shine, even Ulla, the sexy Swedish receptionist whose name rhymed with Oh-lalaaaaa.Asking how they got away with calling a woman a 'toy' is pointless because the real question is how they got away with the infamous 'Springtime for Hitler' and this swastika choreography that concludes it with Hitler's picture? Well, I feel that there are two reasons: right and wrong.Right first: by ridiculing even the most atrocious aspect of human history, you stop turning it into a sort of sanctified taboo. Humor becomes the true barometer of freedom of speech and if we can make fun of God, politics and sex, why should there be barriers even in the 'dark side'. As Mel Brooks said, the 'movie rose below vulgarity' it's so deliberately crude and vulgar that it never cease to mix the amazement with the enjoyment. The spirit of Mel Brooks is what differentiates mean-spirited propaganda and true slapstick, to the Donald Duck fans, between 'Commando Duck' a bad cartoon with no other purpose than mocking the Japanese culture and the masterpiece 'Der Fuerher's Face'.Now, what was the bad reason that spared an accusation of bad taste : because only Jewish people could have made fun of Nazis and even of Jewish people with such audacity, without being accused of anti-Semitism. After all, the portrayal of Max's greed exploits some stereotypes that even the Nazis used in their propaganda, if you don't take them into perspective. Many would discuss this argument but didn't Sacha Boren Cohen invoke his own ethnic background to justify the Anti-Semitism displayed in 'Borat' as a running joke.While I understand that never a gentle director would have dared to make such a movie, I totally disapprove the setting of racial barriers in humor, with its tacit rule to make fun only of our own ethnic background. It politicizes comedy and set rules when the very purpose of humor is to be deprived from anything except the capability to make people laugh. There's no way to avoid critics because the line between being offensive and funny will always be uncertain, but that's the subversion of humor. Many comedians were labeled as racist when they mocked some communities, as if the translation of 'yes, but not with anyone' became 'not by anyone' which distorts the very principles of humor.'Can we laugh about everything?' I guess the answer is in the question, if we laugh, then it's funny. If we're intelligent enough to get it, then we can make a difference between insults and jokes, between mockery and mean-spiritedness, and to those who can't, I recommend 'The Producers' as the greatest fertilizer to grow a sense of humor in the field of their constipated minds.",9,2,4,13 March 2012
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," You know the difference between Lucas and Abrams? One had a super vision, and the other a supervision...
","There might be some moments of awesomeness but it's of the calculated type, designed by Disney executives who know you can't win two billion dollars with art-house stuff.Of course, the premise helped: the seventh episode of the 'Star Wars' saga, what's more with all the beloved characters we left thirty years ago: Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, Chewbacca and Princess Leia, what's more at the time the Internet reigns supreme, so I guess the first billion was a sure-win, but talk about teasing the audience with that 'Chewie, we're home'. I really expected to feel 'at home' in that film. Sure, I expected they would deconstruct the myth a little but not pulverize it 'Death Star' style.A myth can either be enriched or extended, but as long as you remain reasonably faithful to its emotional core. And 'Star Wars' has always been driven by two universal themes: good vs. evil, and the process of learning, it's not about being a Jedi or using the Force, but overcoming your flaws, learning patience, humility, courage and virtues leading, step by step, to the ultimate victory. And all that was wrapped up into a majestic space-opera setting served by special effects and a gallery of characters who became part of a canon that transcended the frontiers of Hollywood. 'Star Wars' belongs to our modern heritage.And 'The Force Awakens' cheats with that legacy, sure it has the package, but the sold product left me with a bitter taste. I'm sorry but you don't cheat with 'Star Wars'. Luke Skywalker's evolution, Leia and Han's relationship, not to mention Darth Vader's redemption spanned three movies, six years and a real genocide of Stormtroopers. The prequels, while not in the same league, featured similar arcs and at least its conclusion brought us an extraordinary feeling of completeness. So if you're going to start another trilogy, you better respect the spirit of the predecessors.But spirit or no spirit, I guess the real problem is that there was no call for a sequel after all. At the end of 'Jedi', the Empire is annihilated and everyone can finally enjoy the peaceful time they've been waiting for two generations. Luke was a full Jedi finally reconciled with his past, Han and Leia were in love and while I didn't like the Ewoks much, the celebration felt conclusive. If you decide that history is a series of new beginnings, that Luke will disappear because one Jedi has betrayed him and killed junior Jedis. That Han (who had some military high ranks) will be a smuggler again and Leia the General of Resistance after a new Galactic Empire has somewhat managed to reemerge from chaos then... what's the point? If it ends well at the ninth movie, what prevents them from adding a new twist? Basically, any Jedi can surrender to the Dark Side, it's a never-ending story and there's a fine line between being a saga and a space soap opera any lousy script can cross at lightspeed. All good things must come to an end, think of the ending of the 'Back to the Future' trilogy, we knew we'd miss Doc and Marty, but that's what re-runs are for.I didn't say much about the film because everything has been said to that point, yes, it is a retread of the 'New Hope' material with the same story structure, J.J. Abrams, a man who knows his job and Kathleen Kennedy the producer, didn't take any risks, they played it safe, by the book: a conflict as the set-up, a secret mission, a young scavenger named Rey who'll discover she has 'special skills', a bad guy turning good, a good guy turning bad, weird-looking helpers or enemies, bombings, space chases, catchy names, and a gallery of interesting newcomers like Daisy Ridley and John Boyega, but all the good intentions of the world don't amount to much when a director lacks a vision.The first trilogy had practical effects and a fresh story, The prequel trilogy had CGI but a fresh story as well, this one has CGI and a recycled story. It's true it has the original actors but just because it hits the sentimental and nostalgic chord more than once, it can't escape from criticism. And my biggest problem with the film is that since it had nothing new to bring up, its most notable feat was to adapt the story to the mentalities of our era. It's literally 'Frozen' meets 'Star Wars', that's not a vision, that's a supervision of cringe-worthy politically correct implications.Say what you want about the prequels, but I'd rather have genuine flaws than calculated awesomeness. In 'Awakens', the plot of 'New Hope', 'Empire' and 'Jedi' are compacted in a way that is insulting to Yoda's legacy and the long initiation of Luke Skywalker. I won't make a thesis about it, let's just say the heroine is perfect, independent and skilled, she's even capable to pilot the Falcon and when Solo holds her a gun, she dares to say 'I can handle myself', which doesn't make sense at all even from 'girl-power' standards.The film left me shaking my head constantly, Abrams, Kennedy and Disney are damaging a legacy with so many 'Star Wars' movies I've lost track, and I guess we'll have to accept that the franchise is ruled by a sort of corporate 'Dark Side' with a business-oriented and PC agenda, so blatant it's scary. And proof that it's PC bull crap, there's one controversial scene Abrams apologized about, the very fact that he apologized proved that the guy is really trying hard to widen the appeal of the film, that he missed that scene revealed his real mindset: he didn't want to hurt. Never apologize, Duke said, it's a sign of weakness.Anyway, five for the ride, zero for the rest. The prequels weren't perfect, but at least, there was a vision.",5,21,91,22 August 2017
Cinderella," What is the secret of Cinderella's charm?
","Ah, the Charming Prince  Charming because he's tall and handsome, and Prince as the son of an authoritarian figure, powerful and rich enough to guarantee a material comfort and young enough to have no responsibilities whatsoever and full time to have fun with his beloved one well, there's a reason why this myth is still persistent in many girls' minds.But let's not get too cynical, I guess there is another reason why 'Cinderella' is one of the most famous and universally appealing stories, beyond the originality of the plot with the famous midnight strokes and the fancy ball dress, there is a simple and inspirational message. On the surface, it's about a young beautiful girl who'll get the Charming Prince thanks to something that makes her completely unique, but we all know it's the fairy tale definition of the wags to riches concept that paved the way to many underdog stories, providing hope for both women and men. Capra owes a lot to 'Cinderella', 'Rocky' is a 'Cinderella' story and it's not surprising that such a feel-good tale ended up being adapted into the (how fitting) twelfth animated Disney film, in 1950.Now, is it accidental or logical that Walt Disney's 'Cinderella' got itself the ninth place in the American Film Institute's Top 10 Animated films? I'm inclined to say both, not to diminish the merit of the film, but just to remind that there were many other Disney animated features that deserved this place, 'The Jungle Book', 'Sleeping Beauty' to say the least, or how about 'The Little Mermaid' or even a forgotten classic non-Disney film titled 'Gulliver's Travels'? Yes, there is an interesting divergence between the film's recognition and cultural status and its content, which is relatively banal considering the glorious collection of animated masterpieces the Disney Studios provided. I'm not saying I'm not a fan of 'Cinderella', but I might be biased because my favorite version will forever be from Tex Avery, I'm talking of the legendary 'Swing Shift Cinderella', which always made me howl of laughter.I also was never a big fan of Disney princess-themed films, which I thought were too formulaic and never contributed to something new since 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'. Anyway, I had the recent opportunity to watch both 'Sleeping Beauty' and 'Cinderella' and somewhere while viewing the second, I had to reconsider my opinion because something was strangely appealing to me I couldn't point my finger in. Was it Jacques and Gus, the funny little mice? Maybe. Was it the scene-stealing sequence featuring the Fairy Godmother, the pumpkin carriage and the unforgettable Boobiddy-boos? Probably. Or was it the intimidating Stepmother, Lady Tremaine and her shadowy bitchy look? Yes, I guess so. But still, we can find the same elements in other Disney classics. So I finally realized that the secret in 'Cinderella' simply depended on the appeal of its titular character.In many aspects, Cinderella embodies the same condition than Snow White, but there is something fresh and modern in her personality that appears right in the first scene, she's not overly romantic and she doesn't take her work as a servant without detachment, even humor where am I going with that? Simply that we never feel sorry for 'Cinderella', as she's not portrayed like a victim, something intelligently hinted in the early scenes. Take the first confrontation with the stepmother, when she's unfairly punished: Cinderella's eyes betray a feeling of true anger, anything but a desire to cry. When she learns that she might be the bride, she's so hypnotized by love that a beautiful smile enlightens her face, and she looks incredibly sensual. 'Cinderella' is modern by today's standards without the archetypal free- spiritedness disguising a real spoiled personality a la Ariel or Jasmine. Cinderella is modern because she is practical.This is important because the obligatory supporting characters fulfill their roles, the stepmother and her ugly daughters are the perfect contrast for Cinderella but the movie mostly works because it didn't forget to have a central character, realistic enough to inspire our empathy and needful enough to give the characters a moment to shine, whether it's from the precious help from the cute chipmunk-like talking mice or the providential help of Bruno, the brave dog. And another interesting thing about Cinderella is that for once, it doesn't need dragons, or killings to be entertaining, and although the last act is set in a house, it's an efficiently suspenseful climax, carried by the memorable character of the Grand Duke who's charged to try the shoes on every eligible girl.The Grand Duke is an important character not just for his comical pairing with the King, but also for the way he inspires the most evil action from the stepmother, when she makes him fall and break the shoe, her look says a lot about how she doesn't give a damn about one's life as one of the most truly despicable villains from a Disney film (who'd call a cat Lucifer anyway?) and coincidentally It also allows the heroine to own her by giving the other shoe, which was already proving that she was the one. The close-up on the stepmother's face at that very moment is the highlight of the film as it finally puts an end to Cinderella's torment. The film doesn't forget to be a fairy tale, yes it's all about the myth of the Charming Prince, but the key that forges Cinderella's appeal is that she's not a passive character.And they lived happily after  despite the predictable conclusion, 'Cinderella' remains a timeless classic that gets in fact, better after each viewing, so there's no use to ask what the secret of Cinderella's charm is, the answer is in the question. It's precisely the unique charm of a universally, timelessly and (might I add) physically appealing character.",8,5,5,21 February 2012
Flight," A Matter of Responsibility...
","'Flight' is one of these experiences so intense and dramatic that you wish the movie to be over soon while not getting enough of it in the same time, like the immediate effect on some invigorating drug.Denzel Washington is 'Whip' Withaker, an experienced and respected pilot but also an alcoholic man who depends on cocaine-boosts to get back on the track. The first contradiction he embodies is how he's in total control of himself and fully confident about his skills while his whole life is a wreck, to say the least. He's divorced, hardly sees his son, doesn't even bother calling, definitely no father of the year material, and he's a party animal enjoying the side pleasures of his professions, including sleepovers in luxurious hotels with the sexiest flight attendant.When we first see him, he's lying around on a bed, visibly hung-over, while his night playmate gets up, in all frontal nudity and puts on a sexy G-string, there's something sleazy about this man and yet when he pulls on his sunglasses and uniform, we're reminded that it takes a lot to make Denzel Washington 'pathetic', he looks like the man of the job. He might be a prick, but he sure is a pro. And so the film embarks us to its most gripping part and what must be one of the most spectacular crashing sequences ever, the one I feared the most as someone who took the bus the last couple of years, dreading the take-off and turbulences more than anything in the world.Right now, I'm ready to kill three days of my next holiday to travel by bus just to avoid a few minutes of turbulence. 'Planes are safer than road transportations' say everybody, well, I give a chance to the road anyway. I'm not mentioning my personal phobia to make myself interesting but to highlight how the crash part operated in my mind and body. I was shaking like the passengers; I could sense the nervousness of the co-pilot each time Whip was acting weird. And like many people who fear flying, I'm drawn into crash stories and I couldn't get my eyes off the screen during the take-off and 'landing' sequence, one where Whip assembled all his skills to allow the plan to slide on the ground while a few minutes earlier, it was simply nose-diving.I expected some investigation-thriller whose climax would be in the reveal that Whip's condition didn't cause the crash or maybe a more slowly-driven study in guilt and trauma with Whip trying to make amends for his actions. When we see him throwing all his alcohol and drugs and getting sober in the trashcan, I was kind of disappointed to see that 'persona' leaving, I felt I didn't get enough of the real Whip, but it takes Whip a lot more to change, especially since the investigations' result come off quite early. It's a mechanical malfunction in the gear that didn't get repaired and caused the nosedive and if it wasn't for Whip's instinctive decision to cancel the fall by turning the plane upside down, a move that required three actions from Whip, the co-pilot and the chief flight attendant and a lot of guts and self-control, the plane would have crashed and killed 102 souls. As a matter of fact, ten pilots tried to prevent the same crash on simulator tests, all have failed.Whip is the hero of the day, saving all but six people, including two flight attendants, one of them he got up with in that fateful day and who, he doesn't know it then, might work as a cover for the investigation on Whip's intoxication during the flight. The irony in Whip's state is that it didn't cause the mechanical problem, and might have given enough resistance to the pressure to bring out the best of him, it either had a positive effect or no effect whatsoever with Whip simply being an ace pilot. But it's not about responsibilities but about principles. The whole film doesn't involve the investigation but Whip's own introspection, just because he's not guilty, and he's not, doesn't make him any less accountable for his actions.He could dodge criticism while he had a job but after the disaster, he couldn't prevent the convergence of his professional and private life and it's ironic that till the end, he could maintain a cool façade, being hailed as a hero while destroying himself with booze. The second act is a character study of self-questioning and the aspects of our persona we refuse to confront because they undermine our path to success, how far we can go by disdaining the values we should proudly stand for. It doesn't do that with patronizing speeches or heavy sentiment but under the psychological endurance of Whip, who seems full or resentment but resists and vents his anger on his ex-wife, his son and Nicole (Kelly Reilly) drug-addict with enough guts to fight her inner demons and empathy to help her lover... Whip insists that drinking is his choice, he's got nothing to blame himself for and that goes until he's driven to the one extreme that could compromise his self-esteem, when he must answer for one little action during that ill-fated flight.And when it does happen, we finally see the edifice crash, and not through tear-jerking artifices because Washington is such a charismatic presence he doesn't need that. His character is a rock of man who seems to resist the eroding effect of his own insecurities, until he found out that admitting your weaknesses is the liberating force and the ending couldn't have been more satisfying.Robert Zemeckis is back at form with this 'Flight', honorable mention to Don Cheadle as a sleazy lawyer capable to toy with the bureaucratic intricacies to save a client he actually hates, and John Goodman as a fixer that gives a little edge to the film. Not that the film needed any.",9,2,3,16 October 2019
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," 'The Return of Harry' or... and so ended a genre-defining saga...
","Well, well, well...After an epic seven-movie tour into the world of Harry Potter, here comes the final and so overwhelming conclusion of not only a decade-defining but a genre-defining franchise.Author J.K. Rowling not only revolutionized children literature through her winning streak of best-sellers but inspired what would become a landmarks of a genre relying both on spectacular special effects boosted by computer technology but traditional three-act structure (exposition with the first three films, second act starting halfway through the fourth, and the climax in the last two films) with all the compelling elements of storytelling: the fight between good and evil, the coming-of-age and the whole escapism into a world never seen before. Like Lewis Carroll, J.R.R Tolkien and George Lucas, Rowling created a whole new universe, a myth.Hogwarts, Dumbledore, Gryffindor, Aveda Kadevra... and so on and so forth, all these words have become part of an international lexicon, a staple of pop culture bound to be passed from generations to generations and to enchant children and adults all over the world. It is no surprising that the film concludes with Harry, Hermione and Ron playing grown-ups taking their children to Hogwarts through platform 3/4 like in the first film, we've all grown up watching Harry, Ron and Hermione from their baby-faced years to their maturity, and then will come a time where we'll look back at the 2011 film with equally powerful nostalgia. Oh yes, I'm sure the films will all live up to their reputation in nineteen years... and beyond.And from that emotional finale, we guess that Hogwarts have probably been rebuilt and the harrowing and deadly journey that culminated with the final fight between Voldemort and his forces of Dark magic and the resistance that combined all the cumulated knowledge of centuries of wizardry will be part of the new mythology. And I feel less like reviewing the film than concluding my seven reviews by saying that the franchise couldn't have a better conclusion. For simple reasons that don't take much analysis: first of all, it is set in Hogwarts, and while it's heartbreaking to watch so many places we're familiar with being reduced to ashes or ruins by bolts of lightning and random attacks, it's captivating to watch all the players defending the place to death.And there are deaths. Many are particularly tough to handle. And for those who have the chance to live, the story provides them chances to outdo themselves, Neville ends up having one of the most interesting arcs in the series, Mr. McGonagol and Mrs. Weasley have also their moment of awesome, and there are two reveals about Dumbledore and Snape that made me question my previous reviews and the way I instantly jumped to conclusions, underestimating Rowling's smart writing. I knew there was something enigmatic with Snape from the very start and by maintaining such a mysterious character for so long over the series, Rowling proved that she didn't have a talent for writing stories but also -as it's the case with Harry Potter- stories within stories.And this 'Deathly Hallows Part II', as far as storytelling is concerned, is fueled with spectacular action like a fitting climax, it doesn't waste time for exposition as no introduction is needed anymore, we're already familiar with the characters and the themes. So the film plays like 'The Return of Harry' echoing the Jedi's or the King's. And for all the action-packed scenes that are traditional offerings but never get 'routinely', the integrity of the narrative is maintained. And the heart of the story is kept as well through reveals of relationships that were the core of the saga all along. Reading about Rowling that she lost her mother of Multiple Sclerosis before she could enjoy even the first book broke my heart but it might have shaped her inspiration when writing about the relationship between Harry and her mother, and a few other characters, or even between Harry with Voldemort.And one can't of course review this film without praising Ralph Fiennes's performance. The actor's been kept away for too long to finally implode, proving to be more than a menacing presence. He steals the show with a glare, a joke, or his hideous nose-less face... it's like the film or the book couldn't fail because it had just the perfect villain. As they say, a film is as good as its villain... but it's also as good as its ending, and while not all the chapters of the saga are equally entertaining, this last opus is a masterful conclusion and I understand now why it's the only one to be on the Top 250. It's entertaining, thrilling, suspenseful, sad, deep and comes full circle through an ending where you can't just help but shed a tear while saying goodbye to these character we've seen evolving from their childhood and even when the wizardry world was as its 'infancy' from our perspective.How fitful that the ending scene is in a Train Station, like Hitchcock another master storyteller, Rowling loved trains and it was trains that inspired her the first vision of Harry Potter, a kid taking a train to go to a wizard school... it's only appropriate that the film would end with that note, maybe telling children that everything is possible, that they also can have their own 'train' of inspiration and image a little something that can grow out of magical proportions. She wanted a character who could do something she couldn't: fly, she created Harry Potter and became an inspiration, a billionaire, and a name that would be mentioned in the same breath as Tolkien when fantasy literature would be approached by fans or scholars.If only I let my curiosity win over me and watch the first film, I can't believe I waited so long. Maybe I should take it as a lesson now and give a try and watch 'Fantastic Beasts'.",10,1,1,30 November 2018
Kagemusha," The Pawn who impersonated the Mountain...
","As a symbol, people are willing to sacrifice their lives for him, he's the Lord, the mountain, the Supreme Leader but as himself, he's nothing but a commoner, a pawn, a property the Lord's advisers can dispose of anytime. He's the Kagemusha, the Shadow Warrior, the pawn who impersonated the mountain.And only Akira Kurosawa, the director who can literally move mountains could make such a magnificent-looking and once again thought-provoking film, his only Golden Palm winner; the story of a thief impersonating a lord, a lord so cautious about the eventual demise of the Takeda clan that he demanded his death to be hidden for three years, it is more dangerous to waste a death than a life precisely because life is valuable, his is too valuable to be exposed.'Kagemusha' is Kurosawa back to his Samurai roots, that forged his international legacy. Only this time, the use of colors and a four-decade experience provide a whole new experience, foreshadowing 'Ran', another masterpiece with a no less bright palettes of colors and shades of red. Kurosawa provide such beautiful shots of warfare in 16th century Japan that it might distract from the main story. Because a war never starts with arms but a mind set.Lord Shingen's death might encourage the enemy to attack his unexperienced heir. This is how crucial the Kagemusha is, so vital that he escaped from crucifixion because of his uncanny resemblance to the Lord. But while a lesser director would have turned this into a gimmick, Kurosawa makes it a source of questioning for the enemy and a burden on the shoulders of every protagonist, including the Kagemusha himself played by Tatsuya Nakadai, the handsome gun-owner from 'Yojimbo'.The actor plays both the double and the original and in both cases, he finds the perfect note. As Shingen Takeda he doesn't give an exceptional performance but provides the perspective enabling us to judge how authentic the double is in the following scenes, the point isn't to judge the actor's acting but his acting as an actor and in the most thrilling moments as himself, and sometimes being himself makes him realer than his own model.These scenes work because the film makes his impersonation problematic from the start, will he convince his men? His crew? His grandson? His concubines? His generals? His army? His horse? And with the meticulous patience, Kurosawa turns each interaction into a heart-pounding moment where we can contemplate the nervousness of the double and spot the sign of nervousness that slips through his austere façade. It's like watching a Cassavetes movie, you fear the improvisation but you know it's inevitable.
It's all in the eyes, one glimpse on Kagemusha's face and we can read every single thought 'what do I do now?' 'was I good?', every time he's looking for some encouragement, compliment, he tries, sometimes tries too hard, sometimes pushes his luck, and we wonder how far is he going to get? What we have is a war epic where thrills are mainly contained in these quiet scenes. Never have been things as banal as encounters and conversations so intense.This is not to diminish the epic value of the fighting sequences, which are as beautifully directed, designed and choreographed as one would expect from Kurosawa. But they almost play like aesthetic interludes or at least that's how I appreciated them because maybe I couldn't tell which side was fighting. But I could appreciate them in their intimate moments, seen from the viewer's position. Kagemusha doesn't fight but he sees soldiers dying for him or at least the man he impersonates. He contemplates the piles of corpses that were defending him and something tilts in his mind.Ever since 'Rashomon' and then 'Yojimbo', the viewer's position was crucial to a story. One would always watch before acting or understanding, there's no such thing as passiveness with Kurosawa's characters and maybe there lies the essence of Asian cinema where even in misleading quietness are sowed the seeds of action. Kagemusha isn't just a character study but a study of a character studying another into a spellbinding 'mise en abyme', the more Kagemusha understands Shingen, the better he values his responsibility as a Kagemusha, it's an existential epiphany.What an irony that in reality, he's disrespected and is immediately disregarded once he fulfilled his purpose. He's a pawn that can be moved, even destroyed, with no regards whatsoever for his accomplishment. The Shingen is called a Mountain and his motto was the status quo, a mountain doesn't move. What an irony that a pawn is impersonating a mountain, and the ending shows that nothing is immovable, no one can stay static forever but it's precisely for his desire to get off his father's shadow and move that the Takeda heir will accelerate the downfall.Not to spoil the ending, I would say that it does close the arc of the Kagemusha in the most powerful way, one that makes the war and the character study converge into a point of existential meaningfulness only to be swept off by the march of history and that even mountains can move, they move slowly yet they move. Whatever the Kagemusha did to provide the haunting final shot is to give a meaning to his life and to his own death, which is after all what his master did. A Kagemuha till the end. And the greatest lesson which is that you can find a meaning to your life in the shadow of another. And Kurosawa's legacy proves it as well.Indeed, if there will never be any director to equal Kurosawa in talent or historical significance, a Kagemusha director so to speak, I guess living in his shadow would be enough an honor. Think of 'Star Wars', 'Pulp Fiction', 'The Magnificent Seven' or Leone's Westerns, they're all classics... that live in the shadow of 'The Hidden Fortress', 'Rashomon', 'Seven Samurai' or 'Yojinbo'.",9,2,2,15 January 2019
Rear Window," L.B. watching you ...
","An everyday man trapped in an out-of-control situation, a cool and sophisticated blonde with a burning flame and a heart-pounding paranoid sensation driving the narrative until a suffocating and suspenseful climax. On the surface, 'Rear Window' is made of the same usual Hitchcockian ingredients, but the film has a specificity that elevates it above all the other Hitchcock experiences and best exemplifies his brilliance as a director and a storyteller.The secret of 'Rear Window''s timeless appeal relies on its self-reflexive approach to whatever defined Hitchcock's style, in the first place, the identification with the hero. Here, we root for L.B. 'Jeff' Jefferies, not just because he's an ordinary man, but also because he's stuck in a condition similar to us with his leg casted after a car accident. He's still above ordinariness through his job, he's a photographer and from what it seems, quite an adventurer, the very cause of his accident happens to be due to his closeness to a car just to get the perfect shot. His métier, cleverly hinted in the opening scene with the shots on his material and pictures, is the perfect device to justify the presence of binoculars, and sort of redeem Jeffries' voyeurism by translating it into a simple case of job conditioning. But apart from these considerations, it's still not Jeffries the photographer whom we identify with, but Jeffries, the man.The man can't move, can't wear other clothes than his pajamas, a nice visual touch that makes the film even more memorable, he can't go outside and basically, he's condemned for a seven-week passivity. Therefore, the only area of freedom that is offered to him is to watch his neighbors from the titular window, and discovering their private lives. Hitchcock uses a clever plot device by setting the film in a hot summer week so it justifies why all the windows are open. We discover a beautiful neighborhood setting where each window represents a little vignette of action within a movie, there is Miss Lonelyhearts, the old maid seeking love desperately, Miss Torso, a pretty dancer who invites many guys at parties, a couple of newlyweds, another used to sleep in a balcony and owning a little pet dog, and there are the Thornwalds, the typical constantly-arguing couple. If only for the setting, the film is a remarkable technical and artistic achievement.Now, 'Rear Window' doesn't question if watching the neighbors is morally defendable, Hitch is just stating the obvious, if we were put in Jeffries' situation, we would watch, because human nature has a tendency for voyeurism. It kind of reminds me of the French adage that says: 'when I see myself, I feel bad, when I see the others, I feel better'. Jeffries seems to enjoy watching people precisely to reconcile himself with his own condition. It's human and this is where we identify with him, especially when Hitchcock tricks us into admiring the voluptuous body of Miss Torso, or laugh at the couple caught by the rain. We're even more voyeur when we tend not to see what's wrong inside us, and this is the psychological dimension that enriches an already clever script. More than a mystery, 'Rear Window' acts as an excellent character study and introspection into the mechanism of voyeurism. And the two female characters play a significant part by indirectly mirroring Jeffries' inner weaknesses that we'd notice if we weren't too busy watching what he watches.The first one is Thelma Ritter as Stella the no-nonsense caregiver who can't understand many of Jeffries' attitudes: why doesn't he marry Lisa, if she loves her? Why is he spending time watching other people, it will only cause trouble (and we know it will). Stella is the common sense of the story, and the reflection of Jeffries' own indecision. Lisa, on the other hand, provides the romantic aspect of the film, which is essential -her entrance with this extraordinary close-up is one of the most beautiful from any film-, Lisa is a fashion designer, elegant and classy, she spoils Jeffries, bringing a whole restaurant to his modest room, but he doesn't share her passion and doesn't feel like she could follow him. They love each other but they can't make up their minds, and while we see them arguing about the way to handle their relationship, we –viewers- experience exactly what Jeffries does every day.Indeed, Jeffries embodies our own perspective, and the neighbor's windows symbolize what we see on-screen. The film is remarkably told in focal perspective where we're put in the same position than the character, and the directing, rightfully Oscar-nominated, is particularly attentive to very simple but subtle details. Basically, each important moment of Jeffries' watching is regulated in three times, he sees- we see what he sees and then his reaction (a smile, a surprise, a shock ) betrays his interpretation. A voice-over would have cheated with the concept, now we only see and try to figure out what happened from what he saw. And when Thornwald leaves the house many times during a rainy night, taking saw and ropes, and suddenly his wife isn't here for the next days, anyone can get suspicious. But Hitch also teases us by showing us things that gets unnoticed by Jeffries. We're frustrated because we know something he doesn't and can't do anything, we're powerless, but ironically, so is Jeffries. And this is where the power of the climax relies, because Jeffries can't do anything, he can't move, he can't even cry for help if he becomes the watched or if he sees his beloved Lisa in danger in Thronswald's house. The suspense here allows us to experiment the viewer's condition on the character and uses the romance to drive the narrative: Lisa becoming a bit of an adventurer and Jeffries starting to put his own troubles and torments into perspective, and learning that any watcher should watch himself first  which of course, applies for us too.",10,1,3,31 March 2012
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Third-Hobbit, Third-Wizard, Third-Cinematic-Genius... makes one of the Greatest Cinematic 'Thirds'...
","I can't talk about the film as much as I want, I'm afraid I wouldn't get the name rights, the locations or the characters who weren't there from the start, I'm even afraid some events or scenes escaped my attention, but I know I love poetry, and the last twenty minutes reminded of these words from Du Bellay.'Happy the man who, journeying far and wide As Jason or Ulysses did, can then Turn homeward, seasoned in the ways of men, And claim his own, and there in peace abide!'This is one of the most famous verses of French Renaissance and I can't think of a movie that captures the innermost joy and relief of homecoming as the third and final installment of the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy did. Even the title carries this regal glory and satisfyingly conclusive nature. And through this 'Return of the King', Aragorn, to name him, also ends the journey of Frodo, Sam, Gandalf, Gimli, Legolas, Gollum and so many names that, two years earlier, could only -no pun intended- ring a bell among Tolkien's readers. I know they were many of them as we're talking of the most outstanding work of fiction from the second half the 20th century, but I suspect Peter Jackson multiplied the number of fans by a two-digit number, with a cinematic wizardry of Gandalfian proportions. Extending my statement about Jackson in the first film's review, there's indeed more than a hobbit within the New Zealand director.But for honesty's sake, and not to spoil my enthusiasm, I must confess I never read Tolkien's books, I've never been into medieval and Fantasy world anyway, although I know the story wasn't intended to venture in the realm of magic and fantasy alone. I enjoyed the first movie because it pushed me into a world daringly unique and imaginative, but so obsessed with its own reality that it almost confined to realism. More than the plot, I cared for the characters, because they seemed 'to have a story before the story', they were not cardboard heroes or villains; they were archetypal but never at the expense of depth and obscurity. Despite these strengths, I welcomed the second film with perplexity because the surprise was gone and the entertaining value was inevitably hanging on the set-ups from the first film and the expectation of the third, situations that were no-more or that were yet-to-come. Unlike its two predecessors, the final film is great on its own. Everything has been said about the visual imagery and on that level, with the magnificent shots, battle sequences and that defining image of Gandalf the Grey arriving at Minas Tirith, Jackson really pushed the envelope and broke new grounds in the field of special effects, CGI wouldn't be a curse word anymore. But all the sets of skills in the world wouldn't amount to anything without a story.Indeed, I was surprised by how moving the final act was. The last thirty minutes of 'The Return of the King' provided some of the most emotional moments of the last twenty years, something whose resonance transcends the limits of the Fantasy genre. And that's an even greater achievement than special effects, Jackson had created characters who had their own special effect, built over the course of two movies, that equals the lengths of three actually, allowed us to get emotionally involved with them. I compared Gandalf with Obi-Wan in the first opus' review but he doesn't deserve any comparison, he's in a class of his own. The bravery of Aragorn, the relationship between Gimli and Legolas, the torment of Gollum and of course, the friendship between Sam and Frodo could finally culminate.And in this glorious gallery, Sam is perhaps the unsung hero of the film because he suffered no fear or hesitation, he was Frodo's guardian angel with unshakable loyalty from beginning to end, and never let his ego trespass in his sense of duty. Of all the characters, this is the one I had a soft spot on, and from the ending, I have the feeling, this is what the long epilogue was trying to convey as without him, all the battles and desperate efforts would have lead to nowhere and forget about the ring, his smile and satisfaction in the end, is perhaps the true emotional reward. Indeed, the Ring was only a plot-driver, the film is about people, who overcome the adversity and come full circle with their own personalities, who seek for the peace of the world, for their own peace's sake. And what a price for peace! What a magnificent journey coming to an end, and what a satisfying ending! The first two films ended with interrogation marks, with an urge to see more, there was excitement, but an excitement pending over the reception of the next opus, undermined by the uncertainty. This film closes the chapter and leaves with overwhelming emotions and inner satisfaction; it is a 'The End' in the tradition of Hollywood epics. And this glorious finale redeems all the flaws or the little imprecision from the first, all the removed chapters or cut sections. Speaking of Hollywood, the film is also known for being the third to get eleven Oscars (including Best Picture) with other classics like 'Ben Hur' and 'Titanic' I guess it is the reward of the whole trilogy, whose last opus was the apotheosis, something that proved that cinema had this unique capability to transport you into a world where imagination and reality made one. And Peter Jackson is one name to be chanted by the bards of the 'Lord of the Rings' Pantheon, for he ensured the popularity of the saga, by translating it into a new language, a new medium. This was a Herculean task that the third hobbit, third wizard, third cinematic genius marvelously accomplished for one of the best cinematic thirds ever.",10,1,2,4 December 2016
Munich," Bombs and bullets can kill, but they never hurt as much as the truth...
","Avner (Eric Bana) is a former bodyguard assigned to lead the killings of eleven men for their involvement in the Munich attacks. There's no contract because the mission doesn't 'exist' which means that it will be taken care of, with Israel's 100% efficiency. And while it will profoundly affect the executioner, this is not a character study, unless you consider the psychological mindset of a whole country as a 'character'. First, I had mixed feelings regarding 'Munich', but they all converged toward a positive appreciation. If there is one thing 'Munich' ever proves is that Spielberg, while flawed as any human being, is a man of peace, and while it became trendy to support war and attacks in the name of patriotism, it is even more admirable to question it in the same spirit. 'Munich' would be attacked on both sides, but as Spielberg pointed out, being attacked doesn't mean 'being contradicted'. The title refers to the hi-jacking of Israeli athletes by PLO members during the Olympic Games of 1972 and what a sneaky irony that it had to be in Germany, as if history wanted to repeat itself. The operation ended in tragedy, as eleven athletes died, to the world's shock. It was a time where Palestinians had already lost the 'communication battle'. Things would change in 1987 with the first Intifada, when kids throwing stones at Israeli tanks replaced hooded terrorists holding machine-guns, thus contributing to the first 'change of heart' in favor of the Palestinians.But in 1972, Israel was the offended country. The film is based on George Jonas' book 'Vengeance' chronicling the targeted assassinations against Palestinian dignitaries accused of having pulled some of the strings that lead to 'Black September': eleven men, for eleven athletes, an 'eye for an eye' move Golda Meir took all responsibility for. She personally believed that there was no time for peace. Why wouldn't they put these men on trial like Eichmann, who did far worse? Eichmann was arrested at a time where Nazism was terminated, and the new evil from the Israeli perspective was the Arabs, as long as these influential people lived, Israeli would die. What I admired in the film is that it doesn't only discuss the victims' actual responsibility in the Munich attacks but even the sheer value of their deaths, because each one brings more ruthless successors, perpetuating a never-ending cycle of violence. I expected the movie to open with the blood bath that triggered the whole chain of events, but this was ignoring what a master storyteller Spielberg is. He punctuates the film with elements of that fateful night as violent interludes reminding the viewers why Meir took that decision, the climax coinciding with the killings. But this is not manipulation, as one could accuse Spielberg of. The point is that violence is ugly and blind.Spielberg depicts each assassination with a Hitchcockian attention for details, one of them involves a bomb trapped in a phone and the biggest suspense comes when a little girl is about to answer the phone instead of her father. But for all the thrills the film provides, what struck me is the way the targets, or at least the first ones, are depicted as 'harmless' people, even sympathetic: one is an Italian-speaking poet and had just finished to translate the Arabian Nights in Italian, he's an intellectual and his involvement in Munich events has been denied, another one is a doctor and a family man, when he's interviewed, he insists that many camps were bombarded by Israel (which means that there are already people who paid the price for Munich). It seems crucial for Spielberg to shows shades of innocence in the victims or at least be indirectly vocal about the Palestinian pleas, and never without really discrediting them, and it actually pays off. When a Palestinian says that they use violence like Israel does, it also means killing innocents, it indirectly provides alibis for the target assassinations as the men killed are still less innocent than civilians. And when a PLO member discusses with Avner about the Nazi guilt, I felt this was the director of 'Schindler's List' reminding the audience that no matter what they think about Jews and Arabs, it is a war for a land, not some extermination project.Now, to say that Spielberg sided with Palestinians would be too much of a stretch, but the point the screenplay (the book was adapted by Eric Roth an Tony Kuschner) is that violence can't be the solution to the problems it causes. And even at the end, when most of the men are eliminated, there's no real satisfaction or overwhelming effect, it is just about a job that had to be 'done', it could have been unfair, but there's a key scene where Avner's mother says that 'Israel had to be 'taken' because no one would have given it anyway'. At least, both sides would agree on that. Served by a great cast: Eric Bana, Geoffrey Rush, Daniel Craig and Mathieu Kassovitz 'Munich' explores the dark corners one country could be driven into, in order to 'make a point', and it is very fitting that there's a part played by Michael Lionsdale because he starred in my favorite political thriller 'The Day of the Jackal', and 'Munich' is perhaps the closest that come to that level of documentary-like gritty realism. I didn't need to wish De Gaulle's death to somewhat 'root' for the Jackal, so I guess even an Arab could be fascinated by the level of organization put to avenge eleven athletes. Maybe admitting that there's a lot to learn from the 'other side' can be a first step toward a reconciliation, but one of the tragedies Arab people must deal with, is that there's no Spielberg's counterpart in the Arab world, to the point that it took a Spielberg film so people could hear their voices.",9,2,4,20 January 2017
The Truman Show," 'It's Live! It's Live!'...
","With 'The Truman Show', released in 1998, Peter Weir delivers a brilliant satire about the excesses of reality shows, with a prophetic relevance disguised under a misleading comedic mask. This underrated gem of the 90's, tells the original, to say the least, story of Truman Burbank, played by Jim Carrey in a breakthrough dramatic performance with this bit of tender wackiness we expect from him. Truman is an ordinary insurance salesman living in the small peaceful town of Seahaven. He's popular and lives in harmony with his wife, his mother, his best friend, his colleagues and neighbors. In appearance only  What Truman doesn't know, and here's the visionary originality on which relies his life, is that Seahaven, is in fact a huge studio with 5,000 cameras always keeping an eye on him and that everyone's an actor, including his wife, his mother, his best friend etc. and last but not least, all his life, was filmed since his birth to become the greatest and longest-running reality show in television history: 'The Truman Show'. Truman believed in a reality which is in fact, completely fictional, and all the protagonists of this pseudo reality, are puppets hanging on the string of the show's Creator who designs the perfect screenplay creating emotional cliffhangers for future episodes. The Creator is Kristoff, brilliantly portrayed by Ed Harris like a kind of almighty God, and the human incarnation of media's omnipotence. And Truman eventually realizes that his life is a huge hoax, and decides to leave the perfect utopia of Seahaven, and go discover the 'real' world. Because that's the point: reality shows don't depict reality, but paint it with fiction, it's real fiction, but fiction nonetheless. The ambivalence is obvious in 'The Truman Show'. Truman's life is fictional, because all the protagonists play a role in order to create a story for the viewers. Viewers who follow the show like a soap opera with a 'realistic' dimension. Indeed, Truman's character is real, as stated by the creator of the show, he is the only 'real' protagonist of this world, his reactions are spontaneous and sincere. The reality is pushed to (unscrupulous) limits, because unlike other shows, Truman doesn't know he's filmed, he's natural. His life is a fiction, but paradoxically a 'real' one. This is the semantic loophole, unscrupulous TV program managers use to justify the unrealistic aspect of their shows. The script's fascinating brilliance reminds of 'Network' in the 70's, highlighting many unpleasant aspects of TV Reality, including the viewer's tacit complicity. Indeed, the viewer never minds the scripted aspect of reality as presented in TV programs as long as it improves his personal enjoyment, like for all these people who were assiduously following 'The Truman Show' in all over the world. The second aspect is the subjectivity of reality. Truman, for all his spontaneity and sincerity, was unknowingly following the storyline that producers traced. And all the situations were constructed to make him react according to a script. The process of mediation doesn't prevent from spontaneity, but it undermines its credibility by creating specific situations for premeditated reactions. Like in some programs where two people who don't appreciate each other or whose views totally differ, are both invited just to create a violent verbal confrontation -supposedly unexpected- to please the audience.Finally, the main lesson of the film lies on the climax where Truman, tries to leave the fictional world of Seahaven, materialized by the powerful symbol of a dome painted like a sky. Truman struggles to get outside before he faces the producer of the show. The latter warns him against the dangers of a hostile real world where truth is no worthier than elsewhere, and invites him to join the perfect utopia of Seahaven, where he's a hero. Truman's reaction is very symbolic. He left the cameras' world, like an artist who addresses his fans for the last time, with his famous catchphrase as a farewell, and finally gets out. This last pirouette, sublimated by the thrilling score of the film, earned him the applause of the audience, as if the excitement made them forget that the show was ending. Indeed, when the show was finally interrupted, two viewers quickly recovered from their emotions, and zapped to another program. The end. Truman is a genuine character, who understood the completely artificial status of his stardom. He therefore preferred to leave a charming utopia and face the real world. Television today launches ordinary people at the rank of stars for the simple reason that we, viewers, observed their everyday's moves, the details of their life's banality during weeks or months. But that kind of artificial popularity is inevitably ephemeral: it sinks into oblivion as soon as a new reality show emerges. And that's because camera's point view as depicted in the film, presents the reality in a dangerously subjective way. The 'staging', admitted by the public as it highlights positive values like friendship, fame, success, and empathy is a dangerous emotional depiction of reality. The risk is less for the viewer, who accepts the process, than for the protagonists of these emissions, whose purely artificial and prefabricated fame can lead to deep feelings of frustration later. The emotional excitement is binary, and plays on both positive and negative poles, it may present for the sake of transparency, real people who suffer and live under difficult conditions, whether in the context of stories, talk or reality shows. The danger here is moral, because with this constant clash between reality and fiction, how can we be sure that the depiction of suffering and frustration will inspire the audience positive psychological reactions like compassion and solidarity rather than a voyeuristic sadism mixed with a circumstantial empathy?'The Truman Show', denounces the fictionalization of reality, through a remarkable fiction, that makes today's reality look like a less believable fiction",10,11,13,28 May 2011
The Matrix," The Unbearable Artificiality of Being ...
","It all comes down to the most central question of humanity: 'To be or not to be'. I've always asked myself whether reality was an absolute or a relative notion. I'm not a scientist but let me tell you something, if reality existed, there would never be marital arguments. You think I'm joking, I'm only channeling the main idea about 'The Matrix', it relies on the combination of individual perceptions, reality depends on what we see, it's a subjective process. You can build countless interpretations out of it, one movie did it without being too complex and by kicking some ass on the field of action.That movie is the Wachowski's brothers (now sisters) 'The Matrix'. Released in 1999, definitely at the right time. Indeed, every decade, sometimes more, there comes one game changer especially in science fiction, '2001', 'Star Wars', 'Blade Runner', 'Terminator 2' brought something fresh and new, technically and visually and in 1999, the year that changed the face of cinema, there was 'The Matrix', 'Avatar' would be the following phenomenon but let's stick to the pre-millennium period, perhaps one of sci-fi greatest momentum, forever immortalized with the iconic bullet-time effect. I don't need to describe it, the effect was used in three early 2000's comedies out of 5, establishing 'The Matrix' as an instant classic, along with 'Saturday Night Fever' or 'Jaws'.Now, 'What is 'The Matrix'?' asks himself Thomas Anderson aka Neo, suspecting that there's something in his surrounding world that looks too artificial to be believable, as if we came to an age where machinery has spread to all the aspects of life, so we can't really tell where the virtual worlds ends and the real one begins. But I remembered a research I made a few years ago, where I discovered that the opposite of virtual wasn't real but 'actual'. Virtual never intended to mean something that doesn't exist in reality, but something that carries a certain potential of existence and can either happen or not happen, if it does happen, it becomes actual. The merit only starts to exist once you decide it to be in an actual form.In 'The Matrix', the most heart-pounding and thought-provoking aspect relies on this simple equation, whatever happens might be a dream or might announce a form of reality that is yet to be discovered but it's a matter of choice whether the hero embraces it or not. It's all a matter of taking the blue or the red pill. There's something both corny and genius in the pills metaphor, the idea that it's all a matter of a simple binary choice, exactly as if human thinking adopted computer binary programming. Yet each choice leads to a totally different scenario, one establishes your surrendering to the convenient and reassuring power of computer (why not after all), another your position as an enemy whose duty is to free people.Which is rather contradictory, why would you give anyone a choice to live in one of the world you intend to destroy, in fact, it's even interesting, if we take the notion of choice as luxury, wouldn't be the most ethical thing to do, to give people the possibility to choose whether they want to be controlled by the Matrix or not, rebels are revolutionary, not reformists. Well, we see one of the members Trinity (Carrie Ann Moss) killing innocent policemen so we're never sure we're dealing with the good guys in any case. Maybe living an ordinary life without asking too much questions would be the wisest choice. But I'm digressingThe film ventures in the realm of an artificial reality that still looks real and convincing thanks to a great design and a greenish tone that conveys the whole computer imagery and rather grim and bleak look of the dystopian future, without overplaying them. It's on the technical special effects that the film elevates the term science fiction, reminding us the core of the genre, it's all about scientific achievement and a fiction, a story where we find our own truth behind, a story that echoes our own uncertainty. The film was made in 1999 along with other 'existential' films but unlike 'American Beauty' and 'Fight Club', the film shows a clear enemy and antagonists, which helps to deliver its complex message; leaving us enough intellectual material to think about. It's one of these films that challenge your intelligence even when you try to determine its flaws.Some critics pointed out the use of conventional themes, of faux spirituality, but let's call them universal, for the theme of the Chosen One is only one facet of the story. Keanu Reeves as Neo is once again playing a hero trying to conquer his secret force. Morpheus is the wise man who believes in him. And Hugo Weaving is the image of the cold and bureaucratic force. But just because the antagonism is clearly established, doesn't make the fight even more complex, it's not just about taking reality back but convincing yourself that it's worth fighting for, it's exactly like jumping on a building, and convincing yourself that you won't fall, one of the best things about the film is that the initial struggle is more internal, it's between Anderson and Neo, and his conviction that it's worth fighting for.The final showdown establishes his rise to awareness and provides the film's climactic showdown but it's the only third act that could have worked for the film, otherwise, it would have been some faux spiritualism clichés one after the other. The film came as a right moment, it had the relevance, the resonance and the idea that we were all heading up to a world where we don't have to trust what we see. It's 'V for Vendetta', 'The Matrix' and any other movies that inspired conspiracies theories.",8,0,1,29 September 2017
Casino," Prospects of enjoying 'Casino' : 80 out of 100 ....
","As an exhilarating immersion in the titular business, the first act is probably the greatest from any Scorsese's film. Marty plunges us into Sam 'Ace' Rothstein's universe through a hypnotic flamboyance, working like a reminiscence of another Gangster classic, 'Scarface'; and Robert De Niro is as charismatic and respectable as ever. I wanted to be this 'Ace', this manager whose infallible competence in gambling, betting and defining odds made it sound like an exact science. The opening is about a competence, and boy, how refreshing it was to see in a Marty's film, a man who loves his profession, and who's not a gangster. This part is the reason why I like and respect 'Casino' as a cinematic achievement. And Marty's direction deserved an Oscar nod, if only for this moment where Ace tries to find out how some customers cheat.This part absorbs me so much I always wish it would never end. But you can't expect from a Scorsese film to avoid the cherished theme of guilt, and no guilt without a mistake. So, we wait for it to come, remembering the very first lines wondering how this could have gone wrong? 'Ace' was the Tangiers' undisputed boss, protected by the mob 'back home', who controlled the casino through the notoriously corrupted (at least in mafia films) teamsters' union. Plus, 'Ace' had a feared bodyguard, the psychopathic Nicky Santoro, Joe Pesci in a performance that would have been more impacting if it hadn't been preceded by Tommy De Vito. In fact, the whole movie has a deja-vu feeling due to its plot's similarity with 'Goodfellas' but this wasn't a problem for me.The problem was the hypocrisy of the whole 'how things could have gone wrong'. You expect the movie to introduce it smoothly while in fact, as soon as it starts going wrong, the whole narrative, is structured by a series of mistakes. Nicky was at least honest and explicit about his intentions in Las Vegas. He wanted to squeeze the town until the last drop. He wanted the big thing, and no one to step him over, he didn't care about warnings, about his bosses' instructions, he was in a gangster's oasis in the middle of nowhere, and Ace trying to reason him was as laughable as his attempt to conquer Ginger's heart. Nicky's 'pen in the neck' was a premonition of him being the pain in the ass. But still, he was the guy whose friendship prevented Sam to act against him, like Charlie and Johnny Boy in 'Mean Streets'. One weakness, I could have handled; but another was one too much, and I'm talking of Ginger, Sharon Stone in her Oscar nominated role.In fact, even Ginger's entrance bothered me, because Marty and Bobby portrayed Sam as a meticulous man who means business and tolerates absolutely no imperfection. So, I didn't buy that he would let a woman throw the chips in the air like this, even for a 'love at first sight' moment, I thought the movie immediately lost its gripping realism, and it's one of the few weaknesses I noticed, after the dummy in the car's explosion and before Anna Scott's strangely blood-less murder. I couldn't believe the guy who told the croupier to perfectly align the chips, or the cook to keep the same quantity of blueberries in the muffins would let this happen. Well, let's concede that it was love, and Bobby played perfectly the part of a man who wants a desirable blonde so much (indeed, she was beautiful) that he didn't care about being loved. And we understand this would be his downfall. But it just started the very day of their marriage, when she was calling her ex-pimp, James Woods as a believable scumbag named Lester. Couldn't 'Ace' get the point? That's 'Casino''s problem: problems come too early, we know it will be an infernal spiral until a bloody climax would purge out the bad blood, it's just a matter of time before it'll explode, before Sam beats the hell out of Ginger, before Nicky gets his comeuppance etc. Basically, 'Casino' is about people wondering how they screwed up, while they had it coming from the start. It's about a situation with people being their own liabilities and the icing on the cake was the disturbing sex moment between Nicky and Ginger. I wouldn't care if 'Casino' was at least a half-hour shorter, but it spans too much time on the 'problems' sequence, it gets redundant and annoying, too much shouting, arguing and of course narrating. Hell, at one point even Nicky's sidekick, Frank Vincent as the namesake Marino, started doing voice-over. The movie reached an extraordinary level of noisiness where even the soundtrack got in my nerves, the part with Ginger and Lester and the 'Can't Live if Living is Without You' song was annoyance at its peak before Marty finally redeemed the film.At the end, 'Casino' finally reconciles with the idea that we're watching a Gangster film, and that all this mess must come to an end now, and all the protagonists of this tragicomedy must meet their maker, in the most gruesome way if possible. And I can't go on without mentioning that particularly gruesome and disturbing scene, where Nicky witnesses the death of his brother Dominick before receiving the same batting treatment from Marino and the gang. 'Billy Batts' revenge' broke both Nicky's bones and my heart, and his crying followed by a bloody face half-breathing before covered by sand, will haunt me forever.'Casino' starts and ends with intensity, but in-between  well, it's like starting a Texas Holdem game, with a pair in your hands, expecting to win with two pairs, or a three of a kind, but at the end, you just win because all the players folded. Shorter would have been better with less style and more substance.And that's that.",8,1,2,22 May 2011
Heat," The Missing Link Between Melville and Nolan...
","What makes 'Heat' such a unique crime film is that it is both a gangster and a cop picture, which means that it spans an equal amount of time in both sides of the law and still manages to be original and compelling when they go toe-to-toe. This is a film that is obviously addressed to viewers who are familiar enough with heists, shootouts and police procedural to believe they've seen them all, but Michael Mann made a 180-minute script, as methodic, intelligent and articulate as its characters. And speaking of characters, they're not defined by some narrative status, sure, the criminals are the bad guys and the cop the heroes, but the film mainly shows them as men, with lives, wives, girlfriends, motives and weaknesses, and it takes all the time needed to do it in the most absorbing way. After all, you don't just make a character-driven picture about five or six people in ninety minutes. Now, let's get deeper in the film.Generally, in cop movies like the 'Dirty Harry' films, you have the central protagonist and the 'charismatic' villain. Gangster movies are centered on a specific operation and the gangsters' personalities generally undermine the outcome. 'Heat' works on these two levels but with one pivotal difference: the cop and the bandit are not portrayed in a way that would influence our empathy. The cop, Vincent Hanna, is a tormented guy who can't handle his third wife and depressed stepdaughter, and Neil McCauley is a solitary criminal who lives by a code. His golden rule is not to depend on something he can't get rid of in less than 30 seconds. Did I mention that Al Pacino and De Niro play these guys? Of course, everyone knows but does it matter? These two actors are my all-time favorite, but the story is so engaging and well-written that I'm sure any other actors would have made it work. 'Heat' is so good that even the Pacino-De Niro pairing (the first since 'The Godfather Part II') almost feels like a publicity stunt, as if the film needed that little kick. Well, I'm glad they picked these two actors, and their confrontation in the coffee scene, halfway through the film is a highlight and the best illustration of the film's central theme: men who live for their job and don't know whether they enjoy the action or they're entrapped in the impossibility to live a 'normal' life because of their jobs. They have more in common than they think, and they're both atypical even within their crew.Still, from the way the conversation ends, we know their worlds tightly interact but don't mix. There will be a confrontation sooner or later. The film doesn't sugarcoat the criminal doings, nor does it ridicule the cops and that's important. The character of De Niro outshines the others because of his no-nonsense professionalism, beautifully echoed by the more volatile and dangerous personality of the villain within the villains, played by a convincing Kevin Gage. Now, that Waingro is a creepy criminal who adds his little spice to the film, and whenever he's is on the screen, you know there's trouble coming. He's a disturbing human being but crucial to the film, we know McCauley is on the wrong side of the law, still, he's closer to Hana than to Waingro.'Heat' is a patient and serious epic-scale crime drama that borrows many elements from a director I admire: Jean-Pierre Melville. There's a Samurai-like quality in McCauley and maybe a little something from Lino Ventura, physically. Here is a tough guy dedicated to his job, and nothing else, which means no girls but if he finds the right one, he might change his mind, for better or worse. 'Heat' is about many men who end up acting according to their nature, even if it implies a price. And while the main focus is on Pacino and De Niro, it would be unfair to ignore Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, Ashley Judd, Jon Voight and Natalie Portman who seemed to have gained in maturity ever since 'Leon'. If Melville inspires Mann, he distances himself by giving a more substantial role to the women, the film features many domestic scenes and marital arguments and overall, the women are not just used like props to their men's macho appeal.But I make the film sound like some existential journey while it also a school-case of thrilling action sequences and a bank robbery providing the most spectacular shootout you'll ever see, it is long but you never feel anything happening there gratuitous, from the first moment where they enter the bank, the way they handle the robbery and leave the car, you almost feel sorry for the cops' arrival, not because you root for the criminals, but because the real chaos and loss of lives result from the shootout. And some deaths come as unexpected and shocking but they're here to show how random and cruel life is, after all, the whole chain of events started with a miscast criminal, who was lucky enough to escape from his execution. Karma is also an important character in the film.So we have one of the greatest shootouts of cinema's history, one of the most elaborate criminal operations and equally gripping police investigation, an intelligent drama about men ruling their lives according to what they do the best and we don't necessarily enjoy what we do the best. And we have a director who seems to have embraced the professionalism of his characters to make his personal masterpiece, perhaps the ultimate cop/gangster picture and it's only fitting that the film confronts the actors who played more gangsters and cops than any others. And if 'Heat' is a inspired by classic Melville film-noir crime flicks, Christopher Nolan admitted to have borrowed elements from 'Heat' to make 'The Dark Knight'. See, the torch was passed and 'Heat' is now a milestone.",9,9,12,20 October 2016
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The Birth of a New Cinematic Era ...
","I wish I belonged to the generation that experienced 'Star Wars', in the dark, with a box of pop-corn. I wish I could have seen the film with the same fascinated eyes that witnessed the inauguration of a whole new cinematic era. 'Star Wars' would have meant probably more for me  However, I believe the purpose of a film's review is to be based on a minimum of objectivity, especially when it comes to the facts. You might appreciate or not 'Citizen Kane', but you can't deny the impact and influence it had on film-making. '2001: A Space Odyssey' pushed the concept of Artistic film to an unreachable level of abstraction and perfectionism, but is not the most systematically praised film. And if 'Star Wars' represents to some movie experts from MY generation, the quintessential unsubstantial and money-maker blockbuster, I just invite them to reconsider their vision by imagining themselves in the movie theater, transported to a universe, never experienced before  A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away  a brief pause before resonates the fanfare of American Cinema's most iconic score, rightfully voted #1 by the American Film Institute, with the two magic words : Star Wars, in a no less iconic design. All these elements, followed by the prologue scrolling up the screen constitute the trademark of one of the greatest cinematic sagas, regardless of the quality of any sequel. John Williams' music plays like the celebration of imagination's triumph, of George Lucas's extraordinary creativity. In one minute, we're plunged into another dimension, indeed far, far away, and in no less than one hour, they're all here, the gentle and cowardly C3PO, the cute and childish R2D2, the courageous Princess Leia, the sinister Darth Vader, the idealistic Luke Skywalker, the wise Obi-Wan Kenobi and the coolest of all, Han Solo and his furry sidekick Chewbacca  probably the richest and most recognizable gallery of characters ever.The imagery, the costume design and the distinctions between the characters allow us to identify with any one of them, regarding their motives, their personal ambitions or their ultimate evolution. Indeed, even the most spectacular special effects and the most thrilling action would have been meaningless without the motives inhabiting the hearts of the characters, and without a meaning to this whole battle. And Lucas, besides being at the top of his game as a director is also one hell of a storyteller, for the choice to use space as the setting of a traditional battle between the good and the evil is a masterstroke, as it allowed the film to be a fantasy epic in the purest tradition of Japanese stories and medieval quests with a modern feel, an ambivalence perfectly conveyed by John Williams' score. By the way, I'm most thankful for Mr. Kurosawa for having inspired Lucas, with the legendary 'Hidden Fortress' And like 'The Hidden Fortress', the story works because the good guys are likable but not flawless : Leia acts like a mouthy little brat, Han Solo, acts and talks like a greedy mercenary and Luke exudes a naive idealism in his attitude. But beyond these facades, every character is absolutely endearing, on the top of them, Luke. Skywalker's evolution is the heart of the film, he embodies the fight between the good and the evil with an intensity that makes him one of the most romantic movies' heroes, and I mean romantic in the real meaning of the world : the spirit of an eternal, misunderstood, adolescent eager to change the world, even the score's tonality becomes strangely romantic in any scene featuring Luke. So, more than an epic fantasy, 'Star Wars' is a coming of age story with all the elements that will trace in a conventional, but captivating way, the destiny of Luke, starting with the poignant relationship between the disciple and his mentor Obi-Wan, Alec Guinness who, in his Oscar-nominated performance, reinforced the seriousness of the film and provided a sense of quiet dignity. Otherwise, the movie would have been a bunch of kids fighting the forces of evil, Lucas needed an established icon to incarnate the forces of good, better known as the Force. As a religious allegory, the Force crystallizes any beliefs that inspire us and help us to fight the adversity and like a God-like presence, it's an abstraction characterized by its effect. Obi-Wan is the embodiment of the Force, as the gift that only belongs to Jedi knights  Beyond the metaphysical undertones that covers the brilliance of the script, Lucas knows how to tease the viewer, and create this desire to 'have more'  So, I don't know if George Lucas anticipated making sequels while preparing the film, but this is certainly his most sincere one. He worked on the screenplay many years before coming with the final story and I'm sure he didn't think of the whole merchandising and pop-culture phenomenon that would come after. And maybe I kind of blame 'Star Wars' for having paved the way to the blockbuster, basically the formula that couldn't fail : entertainment, memorable characters, great score, and almost guaranteed success. Movies would become synonyms of investments, big releases, and unless you were a known director, you couldn't afford to make an artistic film anymore. The film sealed the fate of the 'New Hollywood' era that started ten years before, a chapter was coming to end, opening the one featuring all the 'Superman', 'Indiana Jones', 'Lord of the Rings' and 'Harry Potter' But 'Star Wars' is unique  Adults were receptive to its depth, teenagers captivated by the story, kids loved the characters and everybody was thrilled by the spectacular special effects-driven action. 'Star Wars' is cinematic entertainment at its best, because whatever came after, for the better or for worse, 'Star Wars' is the number one.",10,2,4,13 August 2011
Deadpool," A movie for superhero movies' fans, and for non-fans even more...
","Indeed, this review is mostly for non-fans of superhero movies, because the fans probably saw it already and doesn't need this to know how good it is. Flawless logic, isn't it? They say the first twenty minutes are crucial, you can tell from them whether you're going to enjoy the film or not. Well, with 'Deadpool', the matter is solved at the very first minute with what probably constitutes the most hilariously creative opening credit sequences ever, or let's say 'one of the', to stay on the safe side although I really can't tell another opening that made me laugh like this one, or maybe 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail'. Anyway, I won't spoil it for all the IMDb badges in the world, but let's say, that it was the total opposite feeling than ''I expected nothing, yet I felt let down', This time, I expected something big and I was still blown away.At that moment, I never doubted I was going to enjoy it, I knew I could comfortably sink into my seat and I'll keep up smiling and laughing all through the film, I mean, one that manages to make you laugh in the credits sequences is like gently telling you 'we care about you', yes, that's what it shows, a sort of special VIP dedication to the viewer, not to leave any detail unexploited for the sake of laughs. And it sort of borrows from the Python humor, it's anarchical, out of place, and spares nothing, not even self-derision, and I like that. And boy, the rest of the movie, with its fourth-wall breaking, its flashbacks, its constant nods to the audience never leaves you down, 'Deadpool' is funny from beginning to end, credits included, and with a creative quality that is Oscar-worthy as far as screen writing goes.Now, remember, I said this review was for non-superhero movies' fans. Not that it's an issue if you love them but I have to warn you, you won't like me if I said I never loved superhero movies, apart from 'Superman' maybe, and if there ever was a trend that annoyed me these last years, it was this overdose of Marvel adaptations. I grew up with Tintin, Lucky Luke, Asterix (French-Belgian school) so I loved my heroes ordinary or anti- rather than super. I know some superheroes are more off-hand and comical than others, but if you're not an expert, how will you tell them apart? There are just too many, and when I saw 'Deadpool''s trailer, I was like, here we are, another Spider-man clone. Yet the tone wasn't exactly the same, , but was it a spoof? I didn't even know the character existed in the X-Men universe so how can a preexisting character parodies the universe he belongs to? Now, do these things really matter? Probably not, the one thing is that the trailer looked funny, and the movie better because it's a signal when a trailer isn't really efficient, it doesn't throw all the gags inside just to mislead you. Now to the story, there's Wade (Ryan Reynolds) a retired Special Forces operative falling in love with Vanessa (Morena Baccarin), an escort girl. So, they live a beautiful romance until he's diagnosed with the big C, and leaves Vanessa. Later, he bumps into an Agent-Smith like recruiter who informs him about a special treatment to cure cancer. Wade is treated by the sadistic Ajax and his female and generously-endowed sidekick Angel Dust. After a series of painful treatments and tortures, Ajax reveals his true intentions, turning Wade into a super-slave for wealthy customers. A final process of mutation leaves Wade totally disfigured but able to escape, and become totally indestructible. He needs Ajax to repair his face and while Ajax can't touch him, he takes on his most vulnerable spot: Vanessa. So, Deadpool, with the help of a colossal version of the Tin-Man (without the ridiculous hat) and a malcontent teen who looks like a mix of Sinead O'Connor and Daria, Deadpool is off to save Vanessa.I can hear the déjà-vu bells ringing, but just because the film swims in familiar waters, doesn't mean you're going to drown in an ocean of clichés. Well, there are clichés, actually, who am I kidding? But it's all in the treatment and the writing, and the film acknowledges that the writers are the real heroes, and for reasons: self-derision is the greatest mark of humor and there's something very refreshing in the way the film ridicules its own material, that's exactly how 'Kick-Ass' started before going downhill with a violence that took itself seriously. 'Deadpool' never does and that's what a superhero movie should do. By becoming ridiculous in purpose, from the start, 'Deadpool' is even brilliant and creates a precedent that will make hard to take other superhero movies in a serious light, but in a way, it's a kind of reboot in tone of the superhero sub-genre.And apart from the writing, I also credit Tim Miller's directing for never letting the action steal the fun's thunder, in fact, the way the action sequences are choreographed serves the comedy, not the opposite, and that's a feat you rarely see achieved in movies. The film has a few slower moments here and there, but just when you get the feeling that it's getting closer to the typical material, you realize it's only 'serious' interludes before the fun picks off again.So far, 'Deadpool' is this winter's winner, and I suspect this is going to break the billion record, because it's the perfect 'word of mouth' movie, I know I can recommend this film, because I know people who're fans of superhero movies, and these are the ones I'll immediately tell to go watch the film because I don't want them to misjudge the film. It is that good.",8,3,12,19 February 2016
Ran," 'Ran' is pure cinematic poetry ...
","'Ran', how such a short, such a light, almost feeble word can be so poetic, so colorful, so tragic, so meaningful ... and so cinematographically beautiful ...'Ran', what can you say about 'Ran'? First of all, the movie strikes by its stunning visuals, the use of colors and the beautiful landscape shots ... this was one aspect of Kurosawa that obviously couldn't emerge from his earlier works, and I was so used to watch epics in Technicolor, that I wasn't very impressed in the beginning. BUT Kurosawa is so talented, what am I saying, such a genius, that even the use of colors serves as a clever plot device, it's not just to make the movie look better, but also to give you a clearer view of the battles, and the need of colors to distinguish between the armies highlights the central element and most tragic element of the plot, which is that these blood bathed battles are internal, it's between brothers, it's between the sons of a man, who sees all his hopes and dreams annihilated, who witnesses the failure of a whole life, which makes the massacres more and more sickening and heart-breaking especially because it all ends up in the same dominant color in the end.The movie is not just a cinematographic achievement, it's a movie about the power that ultimately corrupts people's souls, a movie showing that greed, for lack of a better word, is bad and leads to destruction and ultimately, self-destruction. The movie is guilty of preaching but not during the preaching scenes, it tells you not to trust those who say they love you or those who throw flowers in your path. Indeed, people who wants the best of you won't feel the need to appear sympathetic in front of you ... unfortunately, power not only corrupts but it also blinds and drowns in the ocean of greed, your intelligence, that can only survive on the boat of humility ... the same humility the Father lacked in the beginning, before realizing when it was too late, how wrong, wrong and wrong he was. Epic Tragedy! Just like 'The Godfather', 'Ran' is about the eternal Shakespearian theme of power and succession, but whether the succession in Coppola's crime epic was successful, in 'Ran', it was a tragic and bloody failure ... how can greed be so destructive? no movie could have illustrated this with such intensity than Kurosawa's masterpiece. And yet, the movie strikes for its beauty, its poetry, and its universality, the king of yesterday can be as worthless as a bum the very next day, your own blood can betray you, to satisfy a pitiful feeling of jealousy, and a thirst of revenge and power. And sooner or later, you pay for your sins. In fact, life is so vicious, that it gives you the chance to satisfy your darkest schemes just to lead you faster to self-destruction ... life as the seemingly indifferent Gods mentioned in the film, are they? regarding indifference and lack of love and empathy, isn't the film inviting us to question ourselves 'well, aren't we, too?' 'Ran' means 'Revolt'. Well, it sure inspired me one feeling of revolt ... towards the Academy, the Master has been snubbed so many times, for 'Rashomon', 'Seven Samurai' and 'Ikiru' ... I couldn't believe 'Ran' won only one Oscar and ... for costume design, but time speaks for 'Ran' now, and the movie is rightfully recognized as one of the greatest cinematic epics and directorial achievements. The movie redefined epic like 'The Godfather' did for Gangster movies, it gave it a new poetic and tragicomic dimension freed from any dull Manichaeism and other clichés, and to use another cinematic comparison, if 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail' makes 'Ben-Hur' look like an epic then 'Ran' makes any modern epic look like 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail' ... For one simple reason that doesn't take a long philosophical analysis : 'Ran' is entertaining as hell, there isn't a single dull, boring or sappy moment, forget the battles scenes, even the dialog, the shots on the clouds, the character development are insightful and masterfully directed ...'Ran', Kurosawa's masterpiece (I feel like writing a pleonasm) is pure cinematic poetry ... my Respects, Master Kurosawa!",10,1,4,30 December 2010
Tarzan," The last Hurrah of Disney Renaissance...
","1999 was a cinematic year marked by the seal of originality and self-questioning that fitted the upcoming New Millennium timing, it is also the year where animated movies like 'Toy Story 2' and the 'South Park' movie came out and they were so in-line within the modern mood of their era, that they might overshadow 'Tarzan' despite not being as visually breathtaking.Indeed, for all its spectacular jungle canvas and spellbinding animation (the animators really outdid themselves), not to mention its heartfelt story not devoid of a few existential undertones, 'Tarzan' might be too 'classic' for its own good. The film is often noticed for being the last of the Disney Renaissance era, and it is true that if we forget the sorry streak of straight to video sequels of the early 2000's, Disney had definitely surrendered to the CGI wave after that. But 'Tarzan' was made a bit too late, when the pulse of animation was beating in 3D and when the torch of traditional animation had already passed to Hayao Miyazaki. 'Chihiro's Travel' is light years ahead of 'Tarzan'.I liked Tarzan a lot despite my criticism, I loved the relationship he had with his environment and the character of Kala, his adoptive mother voiced by Glenn Close, who is certainly one of the most memorable mother figures of Disney canons. There must be something about Close's voice as she was also remarkable as Homer Simpson's mother. The character of Jane is also a nice twist on the usual love interest figure and Minnie Driver delivers a fine performance as a girl always in good mood, curious about everything and whose awkwardness with Tarzan is both touching and funny. I loved the lighthearted tone of the encounter between Tarzan and Jane, the way they both try to communicate (we get it that the English spoken with animals is just the usual artistic license and that it's meant to be a series of articulate grunts and adequate body language) and how a well-meaning Tarzan tries to fit between the two worlds. Voiced by Tony Goldwyn, Tarzan is certainly deeper than most Disney protagonists, torn between the love and friendship of some and the defiance of other, most notably, Kala's mate, voice by Lance Henrikssen, who refuses to recognize him as a son.We do root for Tarzan, he's certainly an engaging hero but just when ou try to except something really worthy of this character, the film just never feels like delivering something reasonably new and fresh, if we except the splendid special effects, but from the trailer, viewers already knew about the surfing across the trees sequences, perhaps one of Disney's greatest moments. The problem is that the relationships, as original as they are, fail to blow the mind of an audience who's seen 'The Jungle Book', 'Beauty and the Beast' or even 'Pocahontas'. The blame might also be on the weakness of the main villain (Brian Blessed) and the too distractingly old and goofy father (Nigel Hawthorne), I couldn't believe he would be Jane's father but Disney has a tendency to make little goofy midgets fathering beautiful and tall women, at least Tarzan looked like his real parents. Both the bad guy and the professor were rather dependable and maybe the story could have worked better without them, but I guess the purpose of the film was to culminate with a men vs. animal confrontation with Tarzan as the common denominator, but they could have found a more original climactic action sequence. The songs are touching and poignant like Phil Collins' songs but in a year where the 'South Park' movie provided at least three Oscar-worthy songs, I won't forgive the Academy for having taken the easy choice. So I won't develop that chapter and will conclude by saying that 'Tarzan' is certainly the last hurrah of Disney Renaissance and a great animated film in the sense that the animation is great and the story engaging but not to the point you'd want to watch it a second time.I'm a father and since today is Christmas, I just remembered I often bought Disney DVDs to my daughter and 'Tarzan' is one of the rarest ones, there must be a reason, don't you think?",7,0,0,24 December 2017
Apollo 13," One of the 90's Finest Hours...
","'Houston, we have a problem'.This simple and yet ominous announcement, ranking fiftieth in the American Film Institute's Top 100 Movie Quotes, became a staple of pop-culture, referencing to any acquaintance with an inconvenience... of as yet undetermined seriousness. Well, problem is the word to underline.They say in journalism jargon that a train arriving on time is no news but it becomes news when it doesn't. There's a moment in 'Apollo 13' where the three men en route to the moon: Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks), Fred Haise (Bill Paxton) and Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon) are clowning around in front of the camera, ignoring that they're not even aired on TV. When Jim Lovell's wife Marilyn (Kathleen Quinlan) asks why, the answer says it all: the audience finds moon missions as exciting as a trip to Pittsburgh. But the fact is that Apollo 13 never made it to 'Pittsburgh'. And that was news, at least, news enough so Ron Howard would make a film of it, a film with actors and screenplay, but with the realism and the accuracy of a docudrama, and quite a good one.There's some talk now about a Neil Armstrong biopic to be directed by Damien Chazelle but so far, it says a lot that Apollo 11, the one with the small step and giant leap, one of the greatest adventures men ever embarked in (also the most hazardous, according to JFK) never made into a film, not even 'The Right Stuff' which ended with Gordo Cooper's flight and mentioned the deaths of astronauts Grissom, Chaffee and White in the infamous 1967 Apollo 1 fire. 'Apollo 13' actually starts with that tragic incident as it established its kinship with the other all American space-themed classic. Indeed, 'Apollo 13' can be seen as a continuation of 'The Right Stuff' with Ed Harris as a common link, Harris playing the Oscar-nominated part of Nasa Flight Director Gene Kranz. And what an irony that it's Apollo 13, the third mission to the moon that made Kranz famous, not the first.And apart from Armstrong, Aldrin (and to some degree, Collins), I don't think anyone remembers the name of the other astronauts that went to the moon, but I'm sure everyone remembers the story of Apollo 13 and the name of Jim Lovell. Not that posterity matters, but it says something about memory's selectivity: as much as we need heroes to admire, we need danger to emphasize their heroism. I trust Chazelle to inject a sense of danger in the epic odyssey, but will it be as intense and palpable as when the lives of Apollo 13 men were at serious stakes when an explosion deprived the spacecraft from oxygen supply and fuel? One can say the film will have the merit to show the magnificent outcome of human intelligence and a rigorous combination of skills and talents, but isn't it through the miraculous way the NASA crew got their men back home that we could appreciate them the most?Indeed, we never realize how difficult it is to make these flights possible, especially in a time where IBM computers were the sizes of pool tables, where men could control a spacecraft hundreds of thousands miles away but when remote controls didn't exist. This is how craft and rudimentary the material was and this unique capability of mankind to improvise, to be resourceful, is illustrated to the fullest in the extraordinary adventure of Apollo 13, highlighting each step that made the miracle possible. And there is an extreme attention to procedures: how to stop the oxygen leaking, how to keep enough power to maneuver the spacecraft and make the transmissions possible, even to make the Command Module's square filters work in the Lunar Module's round receptacles with a bunch of space bags and duct tapes the NASA crew worked on it. It's not just about intelligence, but practicality and sheer astuteness.And there's always the human factor, Lovell recalls a botched mission's that wouldn't have succeeded if his cockpit lights hadn't shorted out. Similarly, when Ken Mattingly (Gary Sinise) is replaced at the last minute, that makes him available and a much valuable asset during the crisis as he's assigned to find a way to turn on the Command Module systems without drawing too much power, by using the simulator, no one knows the spacecraft better than him. In the 1989 documentary 'For All Mind', Mattingly says he doesn't know what the others do, but he knows his part perfectly and it won't crash because of him. With that mindset, it's obvious that 'failure isn't an option'. They still called the mission a successful failure, but I wouldn't count it as a failure as it succeeded to say more about courage and resourcefulness than any other mission.And it's a credit to Ron Howard's precision and talent to have recreated everything for his film, not one single footage shot, from the equipment to the weightlessness, this is a remarkable achievement that even didn't get him an Oscar nod, while the fact that he made such a film without CGI is as remarkable as sending men to moon with an equipment that would belong to a museum today. It is also remarkable that Howard didn't inject any artificial subplot but stuck to the core of the story, only allowing to show the 'problem' from the emotional perspective of Oscar-nominated Kathleen Quinlan, as the wife who accepts her man's job but would rather see him on the safer side, another element that is handled in the film's bigger brother 'The Right Stuff'.Driven by an intelligent and to-the-point screenplay, 'Apollo 13' is one of these movies that can be screened in professional environments to show the merits of team work, processes and intelligence for crisis resolutions. And it much deserves its twelfth spot in the American Film Institute's Top 100 Inspiring Movies.",9,0,1,17 February 2017
Green Book," The Feel-Good Movie of 2018...
","It's an old misconception that opposites attract each other. Why should they anyway? We welcome personalities that comforts us, reassure us, if they differ from the way we are, I can only imagine the situation where the strong attracts the weak, but you can't make a buddy movie picture with one weak character, you'd be like splitting in half the entertaining value of the film. Fortunately, Peter Farrelly's 'Green Book' is about two characters, with sharply defined personalities, who are only opposite on the cinematic surface, the difference is the silver platter on which the meal is served.But we can't overlook the platter, can we? A Caucasian middle-aged man and a young black man, a colorful Italian-American man with a well-spoken, highly educated and cultured man or if you prefer a street-smart larger-than-life robust-looking average Joe and a misunderstood sissy-looking genius, a family man and a bachelor... finding a common denominator between Viggo Mortensen as Tony Lip aka running-gag-first-name Vallelonga and Mahershala Ali as Dr. Don Shirley is tougher than spotting Waldo in a bazaar.But for all these superficial differences, the two guys were meant to form a pair, especially when the story of their road-trip and building friendship has 1962 in the backdrop, when we know that the South is part of the itinerary and that it's based on a true story. That's pure Hollywood Oscar-bait stuff, in fact opposite don't attract each other but they certainly attract audiences. So the film is formulaic but the dynamic chemistry between Ali and Mortensen elevates it to an enjoyable, heart-warming feel-good picture worthy of all the applauses at the end despite its 'obvious' significance, the film feels calculated to please but I would lie if I said I didn't like it.And the theater was quite crowded tonight and when it began and I was trying to counterattack any attempt to move me with emotional tricks, I was quickly drawn into the simple straight-forwardness of the story and the fact that (and that's a pattern I noticed in many great friendship stories), no matter how different Doc and Tony are, they strike as nice and decent guys, and on the basis of these characteristics, they attract each other. Tony is so particularly sympathetic that he makes Doc look arrogant by pure contrast, so much that I was questioning the choice of that scene where he put two glasses in the trash bin after his wife (Linda Cardellini) gave them to two Black workers.Yes, that scene was welcomed with a few gasps and many laughs but retrospectively it doesn't quite hold up with the personality of Tony Lip who could be a caricature if Viggo Mortensen wasn't so damn hilarious. The fact that his behavior all through the film belies this character-establishing made me wonder whether it was meant to mislead us of it was an actual flaw in the narrative. Anyway, I liked Tony. We don't know exactly what he used to do for a living: bouncers for night clubs, occasional muscle man, driver for pick-ups or plows, he's obviously a man who can do anything and can't afford to be broke. The set-up to his unemployment is rather confusing, it only allows us to visit his family and neighborhood before it gets quickly and thankfully to to the point, the man's hired as a driver for Doc Shirley during a tour in the South that would end before Christmas Eve.The film might be set in 1962 but we've seen enough movies to anticipate crucial scenes from the the first incident to the Christmas celebration and the introduction of a new friend, yes, it doesn't help if you've seen 'Planes, Trains and Automobiles'. But let's not kid ourselves, the film that is more likely to be compared to 'Green Book' is obviously the Best Picture winner of 1989 'Driving Miss Daisy' which had moved me so much that I could bet a fortune there would be a scene with the Mississippi Police and even one where urination would be an issue. It's also interesting the way the film switches traditional roles by having the literate Doc teach his driver how to write letters, in 'Miss Daisy', it was Tandy teaching Freeman. I'm not trying to diminish the film's originality, many scenes play out fairly well because of the atypical aura of Doc and how Tony plays it like Joe Pesci with the appetite of Homer Simpson (his comical timing is perfect) and yet has a somewhat dignified constancy forcing our respect.And that's the film's miracle, it only relies on the acting power of these two giants, they're so good that the plot hardly matters, the two of them make the most predictable, even contrived situations such as a bar brawl, an arrest or a simple conversation a pure delight. And as if the film was aware of that force in the characterization, I had the feeling that it tried to reach some spectacular climax near the end, make some political and social comment and yet halfway through the final act it changed its mind and provided a fun, nice anticlimactic ending, convincing us that the film is meant to feel us good, and we do need sometimes a good feel-good film.A few hours before getting to the theater, I was controlled by three police offers, I was confused by the hostility I could read in one's eyes, why was he acting that way, what was wrong with me? And maybe that's one of the thing with the film, people judged for the way they look, the way they behave and the way it just doesn't seem to fit. It's possible that the best trick of 'Green Brook' is just when you think it's Tony who'll be taught a lesson, you have another thing coming. The arch is rather obvious when you think about it, but I don't mind the kind of obviousness that would made me feel good at the end.",9,1,2,31 January 2019
The Great Escape," Great story, great casting but 'great' problem in the execution...
","And I should have put 'execution' between two crosses, but it might have given away the film's ending (and problem) despite the spoiler warning. Anyway, I start my review.For some reason, it took me till my 35th year to discover 'The Great Escape'. That's the catch with classics; they're so iconic you never really 'discover' them. From that Simpsons' episode parodying the great escape with Maggie's glorious quest for the hidden pacifier, driven by Elmer Bernstein's score (and a cool nod to the 'cooler' scene), I knew 'The Great Escape'. Of course, I can also mention the parodies of Steve McQueen's climactic motorcycle jump over the barbed wires and the stellar cast so typical of these testosterone-laden action flicks of the 60's, 'Guns of Navarone', 'The Dirty Dozen' and of course, John Sturges' previous classic 'The Magnificent Seven'.I thought I knew everything about the film and needless to say that I heightened my expectation so high they really crashed into the realization that I've been misinformed all along. I love a movie that surprises me but I didn't expect that film to end that way. To put it simply: well, no one really escaped and those who did ended up being executed in the most cold-blooded and anti-climactic way. Now that was one downer ending that I didn't see coming, but it makes sense since the film insisted so much that it was based on a true story, only names were changed (the leader Burshell became Bartlett, played by an excellent Richard Attenborough) and some characters were composite of real-life personalities. Also no Americans took part to the escape but the producers wanted to include Steve McQueen and give him a substantial role. This is where the film gets more problematic.As long as I was convinced that it would culminate with the spectacular jump, it was all worth the dated elements. Every member of the organization had a cool-nickname, James Garner the Scrounger, Donald Pleasance the Forger, Charles Bronson the Tunnel King, James Coburn the Manufacturer and McQueen has the coolest of all, The Cooler King, every guy is bad-ass in a way or another, every element of the escape is handled with the kind of meticulous precision the film can only get away with it on its 'true story' premise, and there's that upbeat music from Bernstein.There's never a moment where you film the Germans in their usual mercilessness, the life in the camp seems pretty idle and we accept the notion of a POW having to escape as a duty in order to disorient the enemy and create as much confusion as possible. But there's never a moment where you feel that lives are at stakes, on an individual level maybe, but no in a crime-of-war 'fashion'.As long as I expected a great escape, I enjoyed every bit of the film. But then something happened: Steve McQueen crashed on the barbed-wire fences and surrendered. If McQueen, the Cooler King didn't make it, then there was nothing really great about that escape. But the final nail on the coffin of my disappointment was the execution. I had followed Bartlett and McCallum all through the film and while their finale exchange before they hear the machine gun getting armed is poignant and beautifully done, the film had lost me. The bonus features went on great lengths about the real operation: what a tragic ending, what a waste of lives. I love the unease of the camp officer when announcing that everyone was dead, and when James Donald is told that fifty prisoners were shot while escaping and there was no wounded, it was easy to connect the dots.In a way, this was a story that needed to be told, it is powerful and it does pay a tribute to these tragic heroes, the fifty who underestimated the cruelty of the enemy, but the way the escape is all set-up makes the ending feel like belonging to another movie. All the gags, the funny moments had lost their charm and worse, I felt that Steve McQueen wasn't fit for the film, which is perhaps the worst thing you can say about it. I don't mean I wish he wasn't in the film but it's obvious (and it's proved in the trivia) that McQueen wanted to have a role as big as in 'Magnificent Seven' and this time he had no YulBrynner to rival with, no need to touch his hat or enhance his presence, his presence enhanced the film but not for the best. McQueen is as cool as an ice cube on a glass of potato vodka. But this film called for a 'Papillon' performance, when it ends with the same cooler moment, and the theme started playing, I didn't feel any reason to smile or be happy.This aspect is also represented by the Forger's arc, Donald Pleasance plays the man who goes blind and thanks to the Scrounger's help, he manages to slip through the net until Garner decides to fly a plane in a scene that seems like gratuitous action spice and leading to his killing anyway. Of course, the weak, bald, blind guy didn't fit and Garner goes back to the camp without a scratch. McQueen goes back, learns about the deaths and then goes play ball in his cooler. The film is the weirdest cocktail of emotions, being too cinematic for its tragic material.I enjoyed every bit of it at first, it sure has the thrills, the cast, the music, but the ending called for a more serious treatment. I guess I was mislead, but even the story is about people who were mislead by some misconception and ending executed. I still can't give the film a six given how iconic it is, so I give it a 7 but not magnificent one.",7,2,3,22 December 2017
Click," 'Eject' your preconceived ideas about Sandler and 'Open' your heart ...
","'Click' is a film made with no other purpose than demonstrating the following statement: 'Family comes before work, before everything for that matter' and whether the film features the typical raunchy jokes of Adam Sandler's movies or feels like a rip-off of 'Back to the Future' and Capra's 'It's a Wonderful Life' is almost secondary when you realize at the very end that you're almost convinced about the importance of Family, and not without a fair amount of good jokes, so as a nice little Family film, 'Click' delivers its premise.Now, did we need to be taught that lesson from a film? Did we need another example of a workaholic father who forgets to see his little guy playing his game (it could have as well been the cute little daughter playing the lobster/duck/singing flower in the school play) and jeopardize the harmony of his marriage and family life? Maybe not, but who ever said that all the movies had to bring something new on the screen? And who ever said that being new was a defining element of greatness? Yes, 'Click' does feature so many archetypal situations in the beginning that it's hard to be appreciated, and I guess many Sandler haters would have already changed the channel. But once you give 'Click' the benefit of the doubt and let the film evolve until the pivotal moment where Michael Newman (yeah, I forgot to name the protagonist) gets the magical remote control from Morty, then it takes off from the ground of stereotypes to build its own bits of originality.Christopher Walken plays Morty, with the perfect mix of craziness from the kind of character who comes from nowhere and the geeky outfit that makes him look like the hidden nephew of 'Doc' Emmet Brown. Who is Morty? Where does he come from? It doesn't matter since the core of the story is Michael's family life and his ability to use this remote control. On that level, the film would still inspire some suspicion, you would think that with a remote control, he would click on the pause button, increase the size of his wife's boobs (although I wouldn't change nothing on Kate Beckinsale, absolutely sublime in the film) or use it to play in a casino and have some great time. But 'Click' never falls in these obvious traps although it allows to have some insights about Michael's menu of life, and some priceless moments involving his parents, played by two TV icons, Henry Winkler and Julie Kavner, totally convincing as the Newmans' grandparents. Other characters provide the necessary reservoir for Sandler's typical jokes, it works, with his boss, played with the towering over-the-top authority of David Hasselhoff, and sometimes, it's just 'meh', like with his assistant/secretary. But all in all, the most crucial use of the magical object will be to 'skip time'.This notion of 'skipping', so convenient when you want to jump some scenes during a movie, is the plot device that would lead to Michael's nightmare. By skipping all the illnesses, all the arguments with his wife, and all the boring moments spent with his Family, kids and parents, Michael created an accidental automatism that was kept in the remote's memory. The mechanism is very complex and the movie doesn't have the same subtlety that allowed the script of 'Back to the Future' to explain what the 'Flux Capacitor' was about with clarity, but we rapidly get the point, thanks to a clever editing. In a nutshell, just because Michael fast- forwarded one moment of intimacy with his wife, if he used the remote to go his next promotion, the remote would 'assume' that all the other sex moments would be fast- forwarded, all the sicknesses skipped, all the traffic jams and arguments too. As the remote gets more out of control, the jump in times gets bigger, and Michael quickly finds himself obese with obese kids, then old with a brilliant architect as a son and a daughter he finds sexy.Then, the third act of the film takes one strange emotional turn, which might have disoriented both the fans and non-fans of Adam Sandler. In fact, it's already hinted in one of the first big jumps, one year ahead, when he learned that his kids wants to watch police/cop series instead of Dragons cartoons, and that his dog is dead. This part saddens us because we got attached to the dog too, despite his crazy habit that provided a cheap but irresistible joke. The worst is to come when incidentally, Michael learns from his son, the death of his father. This leads to a particularly heart-breaking moment, where Michael goes back to the last time he saw his father alive and kiss him goodbye, saying 'I love you'. If some people find this part emotionally manipulative, I respect that but I'm sure many others who endured or fear to endure the loss of a beloved figure could respond to that scene. The film falls in a kind of melodramatic exaggeration when Michael leaves the hospital after a seizure to give his son a last lesson about Family coming first, before dying, but the scene only works because of this exaggeration.Indeed, the over-the-top melodrama provides the perfect contrast with the following scene when Michael wakes up from his nightmare, and if all that preceded doesn't hold a candle to the almighty 'It's a Wonderful Life', the joy of Michael was absolutely communicative and I would have felt like the store kid when he played with him. The scene with his parents is the greatest emotional pay-off because we can see his father again, and we know we would have reacted exactly the same if we woke up from a dream where our beloved ones are dead. 'Click' is highlighted by the last 10 minutes, and whether the film had some flaws, at least it conveys a positive and sensitive message about life.",7,0,0,8 April 2012
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," An Underrated Masterpiece of Horror ...
","'Interview with the Vampire', adapted from Anne Rice's novel, approaches horror like 'The Godfather' for the gangster genre by plunging us in the most intimate depths of a scary underworld, to understand the complexity of three-dimensional characters beyond an apparent evilness. Neil Jordan's film, one of the best of the prolific 1994 year, is a harrowing journey into a perpetual darkness, whether it lies in the profound majesty of a night sky or in the heart of a creature that traded the admiration of a beautiful sunshine for the poisoned gift of immortality.As the title indicates, the narrative consists on an interview between a journalist, Daniel (Christian Slater) and an affable and elegant vampire, Louis (Brad Pitt) who tells the story of his life which, like for every vampire, starts in human form. Louis grew up in New Orleans in the eighteenth century where he became a rich plantation owner and slave master at 25, which equals being 40 today. The premature death of his wife at childbirth made him lose the will for life, an easy prey for a vampire named Lestat (Tom Cruise). Through Daniel's naive questions, the film intelligently introduces our POV allowing Louis to sweep off all the clichés about Transylvania and crosses or to discuss them. We rapidly understand that 'Interview' is a mature and innovative film.The process of vampire-conception is one of the film's many novelties. When Lestat bites Louis' neck, he gives him the 'choice he didn't have', a repeated line that echoes in my mind, the 'offer one couldn't refuse' from 'The Godfather', a sort of cynical invitation to die or to become a vampire. Louis was already dead by human standards, so his soul could find relief only through non-existence or new-existence, and since survival is the strongest of all the instincts, Louis chooses to become a vampire by sucking the blood of Lestat, who therefore becomes a fatherly mentor, and being as 'young' as Louis, a friend and roommate.Having a couple is another originality introduced by the film and quite necessary because it opens a gate for insightful discussions through Louis' initiation in the vampire world. His first learning is how to kill, something he's extremely reluctant to commit, having still an ounce of humanity in his heart. The life of vampires oscillates between two realities, the beauty of the world in night that seems even more lively and fascinating, an aspect transcended by a dazzling cinematography, and there is the ugliness of their instinct that can only depends its survival on killing lives. Vampires are necessarily evils, and this poisons Louis's conscience, he who shouts to Lestat that he sentenced him to hell.The killing scenes create an unsettling mix of gruesomeness and sensuality sublimated by the beautiful period setting, reminding Hitchcock's motto: to shoot murders like love scenes and vice versa. There is indeed something strangely sensual going between the reserved Louis and the flamboyant Lestat culminating when Louis bites the neck of a little orphan who lost her mother during the plague, and Lestat saves her by giving his blood. Little Claudia is reborn through a symbolic process that involved the two vampires.Claudia genuinely loves Louis while she's educated by Lestat, and unlike Louis, she didn't have time to be a human and plenty enough to become a ruthless killer. The film features a long sequence where Claudia's talent hidden behind a mask of cuteness is revealed with a nice touch of black comedy. Without giving away obvious sexual undertones, there is no way not to see them as a family, making the friendship between Louis and Lestat ambiguous and between Louis and Claudia sort of incestuous, especially since she had the maturity of a young woman trapped in a child's body. The plurality of characters provides more insightful questions about the vampire's conditions and their roots.Indeed, while Louis' torments were more about what was wrong or right, about the necessity of killing, and being evil despite conscience, Claudia discovers in a pivotal scene set some decades after, that she will never be desired like a woman. Louis wanted to be good despite his nature, Claudia to be desired. Kirsten Dunst delivers one of the greatest child performances on an Oscar worthy level. The film takes a sort of mythological turn when they both plot against their own creator. Louis, in a sort of Oedipian movie, kills his own 'father' to become Claudia's only father, so she can live in an incestuous symbiosis with her. Claudia makes him more human and he makes her more desired.The film's third act illustrates the impossibility for this relationship to be maintained when the two vampires go to discover their roots, in Paris. They are disappointed by the level of buffoonish decadence striking this underworld. Armand, the leader, played by Antonio Banderas feels in Louis, an innocence absent in the other vampires, and wants to keep him with, this confirms the initial sexual undertones of the Louis and Lestat duo, creating a dramatic love triangle, encouraging Claudia to find another kind of love, a mother, but the love will be shortcut, as she'll get lynched by the vampire posse, to pay for Lestat's death.The film ends with a weight in Louis' heart which is less a failure than a relieving deception. Instead of looking at the roots, Louis, freed from Claudia's love and Lestat's tutorship, becomes the vampire his own way, finding catharsis through cinema. The deception in Louis' heart is nothing compared to the journalist who doesn't understand how Louis didn't measure the extent of his power. Louis' brutal reaction, grabbing him to the ceiling with his first monstrous shot is the noblest thing he ever did, sparing a life so it measures the true value of its mortality. Unfortunately, the journalist will probably have to learn the lesson the hard way, through Lestat and ... the infamous choice he never had .",9,0,0,30 January 2012
Jackie Brown," A Woman Named Jackie Brown ...
","Quentin Tarantino created such recognizable trademarks in his first two movies that the third one, 'Jackie Brown' seems like borrowing the name, but not the essence. No over-the-top violence, no wisecracking dialogues, no non-linear editing except for a few parts: 'Jackie Brown' is not the most defining film of Tarantino's style, but certainly of his incredibly versatile talent. The film patiently lets the relationships grow and the decisions be made with a level of realism that respects the audience's intelligence. Interactions, deep moments of thinking, while a usual thriller would mostly rely on action, massive shootouts or bloody violence; in 'Jackie Brown', the point is elsewhere, and the plot only works to assess the depth and three-dimensionality of the characters, stuck in a cat-and-mouse situation with the complexity of a chess game. And with so many lives at stake, the smartest will be the winner. There's such a harrowing feeling relying on Jackie Brown's desperate need to be THE smartest, it's only fitting that she is an attendant: her situation embodies the stressful nature of her job, when regularly, she expresses the need to light a cigarette so she can pull herself together, have a break. And think again.What makes 'Jackie Brown' so compelling is that the best scenes generally feature two characters trying to act clever, to make a decision, a move, to see through things. Nothing is taken for granted, not even one earlier scene when Ordell (Samuel L. Jackson) gets rid of Beaumont Livinston, a business partner who's got busted by the AFT agent Ray Nicolet (Michael Keaton) and might rat on him, Beaumont (Chris Tucker) is hard to convince, refusing to get in the trunk, he finally falls in the trap when Ordell tempts him by promising his favorite food after the job is done. This scene is well-written and it serves the plot on two crucial levels: first, it highlights Ordell's personality as an excellent manipulator, secondly, it illustrates in what kind of situation, Jackie Brown is put, when she's the next one arrested by Nicolet.The film is long because it works on a repetitive process, vital to create a feeling of logical continuity when the whole plot is based on pure logic. The first repetition involves the third most important character of the film, the bail bondsman, Max Cherry, played by Robert Forster in a nuanced but powerful performance, rightfully Oscar-nominated for Best Supporting Actor. Max paid the bond for Beaumont before he got killed, and of course, he's the one in charge of Jackie Brown's case. By using the same logic, Tarantino deliberately lures us into a feeling of predictability to better surprise us with the scenes' outcomes. Yes, we expect Max to fall in love with Jackie, but the way it's handled is original and satisfying: no sex scene, no stereotypical dialogues, there's a relation evolving smoothly, graciously, with lines that ring true.And 'true' is the first feeling that inspires the growing tacit romance between Max and Jackie. Hard to believe that it's made by the same director who made 'Pulp Fiction', with an emphasis on 'Fiction', but it's the ultimate proof of Tarantino's originality and versatility as both a writer and a director. Look at just how the characterization works. In most movies, characters are defined by their actions, in 'Jackie Brown', their thinking, their decisions, their collaboration, and their interactions define them through an extreme intricate puzzle with all the pieces reassembled together at the end. The movie can be frustrating at some parts where we don't follow Jackie Brown's reasoning but this is pivotal as she's trying to outsmart Ordell, Nicolet and Max a little bit, that we might feel outsmarted too. The film works on that intellectual and subtly emotional level, that makes all the difference between 'Jackie Brown' and the other 90's gangster films. And Tarantino didn't forget his particular touch, we get the iconic trunk shot, the beautiful sight of Bridget Fonda's lovely feet (sorry), an unrecognizable De Niro in a loser role, and a homage to the opening of one of my all-time favorite movies 'The Graduate'. Tarantino's touch is present but never without serving the story. Take Bridget Fonda as Melanie, she is an obnoxious and particularly annoying spoiled bitchy blonde and De Niro as Louis Gara isn't the brightest of the bunch, the combination of the two makes you expect the worst. They're criminals, they know how to shoot, but Jackie Brown is smart, and Max Cherry has a fondness on her, their 'partnership' as she likes to say, is more valuable than all the guns in the world, to outsmart a criminal mastermind like Ordell.And Pam Grier as Jackie Brown, is the reason-to-be of the film, another demonstration of Tarantino's secret talent not to revive careers but to remind us how underused some actresses are... or some actors like Robert Forster. 'Jackie Brown' wouldn't have worked the same with actors and actresses used to play lead romantic roles. Grier and Forster are so into their character of old, tired, hard-working people that they don't expect to fall in love, so the communication goes through objects, music and other intermediary elements. When Max listens to this beautiful 'Delfonics' song, we know it's his heart for Jackie that is pounding and we feel for them whenever the melody can be heard. Age is one of the recurring themes of the film, incarnating this passing of time as an invitation to act before it's too late, a tormenting feel of urgency. Because there's always more than money, more than freedom. Jackie Brown is not totally relieved at the end as she knows she's won more than a 'partner' in Max. And we're satisfied that, at least, they could finally exchange a tender, intense and rewarding kiss before another song could get between them, leaving the ellipsis or the interrogation mark up to the viewer.",9,0,1,10 October 2011
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," The Movie Doesn't Break the Fourth Wall ... It Pulverises it ...
","To review 'Monty Python & the Holy Grail', there are five schools, I mean three : 1--- The Ecstatic Review : One of the greatest laugh riots ever committed on the big screen, an epic quest of absurdity like only the glorious Monty Python could have lead.2--- The Not-so-ecstatic-but-no-less-enthusiastic Review : Damn, I wish the movie was longer, couldn't they get more budget, it's such a shame. Oh, well, I had a great time, and only for the opening credits, the movie deserves its reputation.1--- The Ecstatic Review (again): You don't get it, Harold, that's exactly the point, it's a low-budget film, and its apparently low quality contributed to the high popularity of the film. Man, it's called a parody.2--- The Not-so-ecstatic-but-no-less-enthusiastic Review : I know, what a parody is, Bernard, thank you. But my point was that the movie could have been so much better if only  *** WE APOLOGIZE FOR THE FAULT IN THE REVIEW. HAROLD AND BERNARD HAVE BEEN SACKED *** 3--- The Not-ecstatic-not-really-enthusiastic-in-fact-quite-negative Review : This movie is so flawed I don't even know where to start, hell, they didn't even have horses and  Aaaaarggggh! *** WE APOLOGIZE AGAIN, FOR THE NEGATIVITY EXPRESSED IN THAT REVIEW. THE AUTHOR HAS BEEN S WELL, SHALL WE SAY, HE MET WITH AN UNFORTUNATE ACCIDENT *** As I was saying, to review 'Monty Python & the Holy Grail', there are three, I mean two schools of review that actually can both be fused into one unique review, MINE, so let me be the bard to sing the praises of this epic tale of hilarity through : I--- The Self-Hedonistic-Introspectively-Tautological Review : The comic genius of the film is so surrealistic it goes beyond any reasonable attempt to measure, judge and therefore give it a proper review. It would be like answering the eternal question : 'What's the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?' I think one should consider the wisdom of Sir Bevedere who said that 'The Earth is banana shaped', an interestingly fruity allusion which is not without reminding Newton's apple that would revolutionize the law of Physics and originate one of the most important principles governing the film, the one I call  1/ The 'Tarte Tatin' principle :This culinary example might satisfy the descendants of the French 'Ka-niggets', the tart was basically invented when a woman who burnt her apple pie rescued it by putting the pastry on the apples and turning out the upside down tart. The result became a famous and delicious dessert. 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail' works the same way, it's botched, disjointed, irreverent, turning into derision every cinematic mechanism of the epic genre, but the result is just one of the funniest laugh-out-loud comedies and one of the perfect examples of the level of sophistication and unlimitedness that absurdity can reach, the one I call 2/ The 'Red Nose' principle : 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail' is a succession of incoherent episodic sketches governed by strong coherence in absurd style and surrealistic comedy, and vice versa. The film is the celebration of the boundlessness of comedy. Here's a mathematical demonstration that would have made Sir Bevedere proud : let's admit, by hypothesis, that there was one limit 'NI' that comedy could never exceed. Now, what is the definition of comedy? According to the Oxford dictionary, it's a 'professional entertainment consisting of jokes and sketches, intended to make an audience laugh'. Now, if 'NI' existed, that would mean that there would be no comedic purposes in anything above that 'Nl' level, which indirectly means that there's absolutely no one who would ever laugh to any subject implying the use of comedy above the 'Nu'  sorry the 'NI' level, in other words, anything above the 'Nl' level could be admitted as 100% serious. But consider that total seriousness is so psychologically oppressive that it inevitably implies the use of a comical element to relieve the tension. And the use of a comic relief is even more necessary in a totally serious narrative. So, from a reductio-ad-absurdum, I've demonstrated that even in the existence of a limit above which we can't laugh, we realize that not only we can, but we should. Quod Erat Demonstratum. Whatever seriousness you build, whatever order you create, it's meant to collapse. That's the principle, the one I call  3/ The 'Castle of Cards' principle :The castle of cards has only one goal in its short existence, to collapse. It's the perfect demonstration of the ephemeral essence of any organized and perfectly structured entity. And the higher it gets, the closer is the cataclysm. What's that to mean? 'Monty Python & the Holy Grail' highlights the eternal victory of anarchy over order, and how even anarchy can be appealing. It's a perfect assemblage of chaotic situations, that gets your mind acclimated to the so universal and true unpredictability of life. Nothing can surprise you, yet everything is absolutely surprising : a three-headed knight, a black knight who continues the fight even if he's totally chopped off, a witch with a fake noise, a castle full of virgins with nymphomaniac impulses, a harmless bunny that can decapitate you in one second, and one of the worst cases of cinematic party pooping ever. Everything is built up until it dramatically ends in one of the most brilliantly abrupt endings, demonstrating the inevitable destruction of every measurable structure. World was created from chaos and it will end up in chaos in such a pointlessness that absurdity is the only language that could define it.

Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The 'heart' of the 'Star Wars' trilogy...
","'The Empire Strikes Back' does its best to visually surpass the original 'Star Wars' and the special effects or the creatures' designs are as convincing as the pioneering space epic, there's also a richness of landscapes, taking you from the snowy summits of a cold planet to the tropical jungle, but beyond the escapism, it's the excitement to see again that iconic gallery of characters, Han Solo, Leia, C3PO, R2-D2, Luke, Chewbacca (whose mourning and moaning sounds took a whole other resonance) and a few newcomers. In 'The Empire Strikes Back', the key word is 'Back'. Now, take the most hardcore 'Star Wars' fan -I think there's a name for them, and I guess I would know if I were one- and take someone who doesn't care much about the series, now, ask the pair to list four or five classic 'Star Wars' moments, I bet a good half of the scenes will belong to the glorious episode V 'The Empire Strikes Back', directed by Irvin Keshner (and George Lucas as the Executive Producer). By the way, do you know the joke, why did Lucas start 'Star Wars' with the 4th, 5th and 6th episodes and then made the first three? Because Master Yoda directed them (punch line drum sound). Well, that's just to show you I didn't use the word 'sequel', and this is not because I don't want to offend sensitivities, but because I don't take the film as a sequel but as the real journey into the soul of 'Star Wars', the dark side, literally.It is in this film that the relationship between Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) transcends the limits of the simple crush, the interactions between them are really catching and you can tell that Harrison Ford challenges his character, and has fun teasing the little Princess who's not insensitive to his charm. A film where actors have fun playing their characters can't turn bad, and it is a credit to the directing for having made the romance efficient with no more than three or four scenes. And they all culminate with one of the most touching declarations of love, touching because of its laconic but sincere answer you know. 'The Empire Strikes Back' is also the film that pursues the coming-of-age of Luke Skywalker and features his initiation by Jedi Master Yoda (Frank Oz). Obi-Wan was a great character but Yoda has everything, the speech mannerism, the mimics and this little quality that makes him like the perfect crossover between Mr. Myagi and 'E.T.' except that he came the first. Yoda is the heart of the story, and when he warns Luke about the dark side of the Force, he knows exactly where he's heading to, and I guess ever since 'Star Wars' ended, the audience knew what the next film had to deliver. Which leads to the one true reason-to-be of the film, the climactic light-saber battle between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker right after having plunged us into the evil Empire Lord's psyche and revealed the Shakespearian truth about his identity. Now, is it really a spoiler to spoil it or is it a of prescription case? In a Simpson episode from the third season, which means 1992, a gag consisted on Homer leaving the theater and spoiling the ending to all the lining up moviegoers. So after one decade, 'The Empire Strikes Back' was already part of cinema's history. I guess you can't call yourself a movie lover but if you don't know Vito Corleone, Scarlett O'Hara or the father of Luke Skywalker, well it kind of shades off to ignorance. Indeed, 'The Empire Strikes Back' is like the second tome of Homer's Odyssey, it is an inevitable and valuable portion of Cinema's history regarding perhaps the one true myth that solely belongs to the silver screen. And it is for this achievement that it's impossible not to recognize the cinematic value of 'The Empire Strikes Back'. Say what you want about the creatures, the special effects, the little gimmick or childish moments, but when the film starts and you have in order, the 'Fox' logo, the 'long time go' title card-and then the first pumping sound of the triumphant fanfare, something melts inside you and you're like a child who just sat on the roller- coaster. 'The Empire Strikes Back' was the most anticipated movie, the follow-up to the all time most popular film and it managed to become more popular by injecting novelty within the relationships and add new characters such as Yoda or Lando (Billy Dee Williams). It even managed to equal the original by having its own score: 'The Imperial March', as if it had to have its own existence independently from the first, and it's fitting that the score is about the villain as Darth Vader seems more majestic and frightening in this opus, actually he was nominated #3 in the AFI's Top 50 villains but it was the Darth Vader from 'Empire', the one with the Imperial March. Even Vader raises its iconic status with his (temporary) victory over the rebels. Because that's also what characterizes the film, the bad guys have the upper hand. It concludes with a frozen Han Solo, an amputated Luke with the painful knowledge about his origins, a disintegrated C3PO and so on a cliffhanger so obvious it doesn't even need the obligatory 'to be continued', we know the fight between evil and good isn't over. I guess at that moment, 'The Return of the Jedi' immediately became the most anticipated cinematic project.",9,0,0,4 October 2016
Aladdin," Forever a favorite of mine ...
","I will never forget the first time I watched 'Aladdin', I was with a group of friends waiting in the airport for the plane that would take us from Orlando to Paris at the time when 'Aladdin' was the 'big thing' in the USA while some previews of 'The Lion King' were starting to screen. 'Aladdin' will forever be associated to that wonderful week I spent in Disneyland, and it's only fitting if the movie is my favorite Disney film, slightly edging-out 'The Jungle Book'.I know I can get all rational in this review, analyzing what makes 'Aladdin' such an appealing film and using the expected words of 'Disney Renaissance' and a comparison with the glorious Best Picture nominee predecessor. I can also talk about the animation, the music, the extraordinary multi-vocal performance of Robin Williams as Genie but I don't feel like getting rational. I love the film for personal reasons that are essentially due to the excellent timing of this film in its penetration of my pre-adolescent life. 'Aladdin' took a forever cherished place as one of the last treasures that enriched my childhood even playing a pivotal role in the way I would start enjoying cartoons.'Kid's day in the USA!' was the motto of the week that was celebrating the 65th birthday of Mickey Mouse, and for a kid who never traveled outside his country, going to Disneyland was the most unexpected destination, the most extraordinary trip I would never have dared to dream of. This is when I discovered 'Aladdin', through the 'Prince Ali' fanfare endlessly performed during the parades, through the films' images aired on TV; something was strangely attracting me to the film. And I guess the fact that I knew the story helped a lot: I grew up with a French cartoon from 1969, titled 'Aladin and the Magic Lamp' recorded in an 80's videocassette, a movie I can recite (and sing) by heart, and there was also an obscure Manga 'Aladdin' film we watched at school before the summer holidays.Needless to say I was already familiar with the story, and seeing it translated into Disney language was something I was excited to see. Would they talk about Aladdin's deceased father Mustapha? Would he live with his mother? What kind of roles would Genie play? Well one thing matters apart from these questions: I knew the story and I could understand the film even if I didn't speak English at that time  it wouldn't have helped me anyway because the airport was very noisy, so I just sat on my luggage, eating some candies, and I could understand who was who and what was everyone's scheme: obviously, Aladdin wanted to be a prince to marry the princess and Jafar to marry the princess to become the prince, and between them, the Genie would come to fulfill their dreams. So, I saw the film and I loved it.And for one year, before I would see it again, the music of 'Pince Ali' and 'A Whole New World' was the musical remembrance of that magical week in Disney World. And when I saw it again, it took another dimension: I finally understood the subtleties of the stories, I learned all the songs after repetitive viewings, and for months and months, I was transported by the 'Prince Ali' parade and its climactic conclusion and the romantic 'A Whole New World' and its beautiful opening, when Jasmine jumps on the carpet and the zoomed-out Rajah looks smaller and smaller, watching from the balcony. I saw the film so many times during my pre-teen years that I would never forget the first sensations it immersed me into, with an unexpected awkward one.I must confess that Jasmine was one of my first movie crushes and my idea of the ideal woman as a kid, I don't know why but the way she looked during the 'love at first sight moment' hypnotized me and the moment where I always melt occurs in the carpet ride, when Aladdin gives her the apple, when you understand that she understood who the Prince Ali is, there are no words to describe how incredibly sexy she looks at that very moment. The crush didn't last of course, and as I grew older and was disappointed with the 'Return of Jafar' sequel and the TV series, my interest for 'Aladdin' declined and it was reduced to 'kid's stuff I used to like'.And then 10 years later, as a student, I saw the film again on my computer, eating a pizza, and something magical happened when the 'Whole New World' music started during the closing credits, my heart was inundated by a nostalgic torrent, so immense that I couldn't stop crying because it reminded me of the privileged place the movie occupied once in my heart. The magic was back, and whenever I was spending a good time with friends, we were having fun listening to these old Disney songs, and the clip of 'A Whole New World' was a must-see  and how glad I was to discover that I wasn't the only one who 'liked' Jasmine.I feel so concerned by this film and so deeply attached to it, that I don't want to spoil this review with critical or ecstatic reviews, the film is just thrilling, romantic, adventurous, and features certainly the greatest cast of supporting characters without it being the counterpart of a dull hero or heroine, there's not a single minute of the film that seems pointless and wasted and certainly not with a character like Genie. That's the best I could do to rationally 'explain' my love for 'Aladdin'.But maybe because loving a film can also depend on external factors that influence your judgment, in the case of 'Aladdin', everything contributed to make this my favorite Disney film ... for sentimental reasons yes, but who ever said they were wrong?",10,19,20,19 December 2011
Inside Llewyn Davis," Behind the moody enigma, a simple but beautiful statement: 'just respect the music'...
","In 'O' Brother, Where Are Thou', one of the best parts of a rather inconsequential comedy, was the catchy and somewhat penetrating singing of 'A Man of Constant Sorrow', a little musical hit that played as significant a part to the plot that the role bluegrass music really played to appease people's anguishes during the Great Depression. In a way, folk songs were both the artistic outcomes and the fitting cure of these times of melancholia. And maybe this is why the Coen brothers decided to pay a second tribute to folk music, through their moody character study of fictional folk singer, Llewyn Davis, played by Oscar Isaac, a real revelation to me.Study is an overstatement though as you don't learn much about folk music from 'Inside Llewyn Davis' except maybe the most essential thing, which is that music is something to respect, no matter where it comes from, and whom it addresses, music is a language that belongs to someone, borrows from a few ones and is shared with everyone. It's not just about the journey about Llewyn Davis consisting of many attempts to rise as a star and immediate falls, it's the journey of music within his experience. And adversity is the stuff music drains its creativity from, human suffering, folk songs are about everyday struggles, the haunting 'Auld Hand Triangle' is a ballad about prison and hell, even the upbeat 'Please, Mr. Kennedy' is about someone who doesn't go to space.'Who wrote this?' disdainfully asks Davis, and Justin Timberlake's answer is priceless 'I did' no big deal but he says it with such confidence that you better believe he takes pride in it, and why shouldn't he? In a later scene, Davis is asked to perform a song in front of friendly guests and for some reason, he's reluctant, refusing to be treated like a trained poodle, this is his way of living, and can't just sing like that. This attitude is rather contradictory with the way he criticized people with careerist moves, and his evocation of myths when it comes to the building of a star's image. In a way, Davis needlessly mystifies his Art when talked about career and when he's given professional advice, he brandishes the Artist card. Is he deliberately dishonest or innately erroneous?Character studies are never as interesting as when they deal with people full of contradictions, and Davis strikes like someone who's never really come to term with his personal issues, he holds his Art into high regard, but he refuses to make any concessions that could allow him to reach his goal. There's one thing though, he loves his music and he's never as convincing and mesmerizing as when he takes the guitar and sings, the rest of the time, he's hesitant, clumsy and pathetic, letting his impregnated girlfriend (Carey Mulligan) treat like him dirt without a reaction. Davis hasn't found his language to reach people, it might be music, but the film takes place in the musical sequence that came before Bob Dylan, so we know Davis won't be the 'chosen one'.Now, are we supposed to feel sorry for him? Maybe. Maybe not. I did recognize a pattern though: everyone who didn't show respect to someone's music got somewhat punished at the end. It starts with Roland Turner, a teasing instrumentalist played by John Goodman. When Davis, tells him he's a folk singer, the answer is 'I thought you were a musician'. Later, the pompous prick is found lying on the toilet floor, victim of an epileptic stroke. At the end, Davis is also put in the same place, hit by someone who seems to have a problem with him. The ending scene is the opening, but it's only at the end that we realize the reason of the aggression, like the punch-line of a song, and in a way, Davis had it coming for having disrespected music.'Inside Llewyn Davis' is perhaps the most enigmatic Coen brothers' film since 'Barton Fink' and there are many similarities between Fink and Davis. These are two men who believe they are in touch with life, through their status as artists and common men, but they're not. Fink is so obsessed to be called a common man that he turns it into a concept that is totally unlike the world, and alienates himself physically (small hotel room) and morally (existential block). At the end, he really doesn't know where he stands for. And Davis is so wrapped up in his artistic ego that he's incapable to male concessions. And he's lost. But he'd rather give up than destroying his life, indeed, , there comes a point when self-esteem and passion interfere.The merit of 'Inside Lwellyn Davis' is not to deal with this enigmatic character by writing a complex plot full of symbolism. This is a straightforward, rather neutral story, set in New York City of the 60's before what would be considered the greatest musical sequence of rock' n' roll 1963-1973. Even the cinematography is pastel, and gray as to illustrate this neutral period before the rebellious explosion, or the gray area where we can't really label Davis. In a way, he embraced the incertitude and transitional aspect of his time, being both a protagonist and a victim, loving so much his music he failed to respect the others.The film doesn't strike as a Coen masterpiece but there's something truthful and sincere about it. That they managed to hire actors who were also talented show that the Coen brothers really wanted to make the music believable and were lucky enough to find that special something and I bet they would have abandoned the project if a talent like Oscar Isaac didn't pop up. And indeed, there's not one single music scene that feels acted or artificial, I guess that's also out of respect to music.",9,1,2,23 September 2016
Sin City," Makes Gotham City look like Munchkin Land ...
","Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino are of the same generation, but not the same range of talent, there's one element where Tarantino surpasses his friend : writing and storytelling, and in Hollywood, that means a lot. So at the time Rodriguez made himself famous with the 'Mexican' trilogy and the 'Spy kids' series, Tarantino was already a unanimously acclaimed director and the standard-bearer of a cinematic revolution that gave witty dialogs and random Pop Culture references their significances to weird intricate plots. And I must add with style and an appealing overdose of fun and violence.Honestly, I'm not much a fan of the three last movies directed by Tarantino, I believe he got so wrapped up in his success that he never tried to get out of his comfort zone. However, I believe the 'Kill Bill' series to be his last masterpiece, the pinnacle of the Tarantino touch, a vibrant, flamboyant and emotionally engaging, homage to the Martial Arts movies that influenced him. But the film had style too, and style was an area where Robert Rodriguez wasn't just comfortable but capable to outrank his gifted friend. So, it's just as in 2005, he came out with his own 'Kill Bill', a no-less dazzling and hypnotic masterpiece named 'Sin City', based on Frank Miller's graphic comic-book series. And that one of the best-looking movies of the 2000's never got nominated for Best Cinematography is as sinful as any of the sins in 'Sin City'.Dark and gloomy, the titular setting would make Gotham City look like Munchkin land, it's over-the-top film-noir photography reminded me of these Photoshop effects where I playfully augmented the contrast to give an eerie look to the most banal image. Rodriguez, a man of his generation, understood the endless implications of computerized images : basically, you could make miracles with it. And that's what the movie is, a miracle. The black-and-white look like painted with China ink, and colors are highlighted every once in a while in the most visually affecting ways, blood is like red stains soiling the frame, the blonde hair of that Marv's sweetheart is mesmerizing, and sometimes, colors get you to more sickening reactions such as the guts of that gutless Yellow Bastard. Color is like a protagonist in the film, images serve the story as the story serves them, it's like the perfect symbiosis of the form and the content.And with an extraordinary wizardry, Rodriguez edits the film to create another spellbinding symbiosis with the storytelling. I said Tarantino was superior in storytelling, but Rodriguez conceals his weakness by adapting the comics on-the-nose, straight-forwardly, an image speaking for thousand words but thousand-word monologues feeling like verbal caresses. Structure-wise, the film employs the same circular narrative that made 'Pulp Fiction''s reputation. In 'Sin City', characters meet each other, you leave them someplace and find them again in another, they're always part of the same universe like different pieces of chess game that only at the end, reward your patience and give you the whole scope, through its bunch of crooked politicians, corrupt cops, and 'gold-hearted' prostitutes observing a fragile truce with the Police. With all the gangsters, priests, dancers, lawyers, killers and cannibals, 'Sin City' is like the matrix of sex and violence in urban Pop Culture, where being good is the exception... no matter to which side of the Law one belongs.Hell, what do you expect from such a title anyway? You have your share of Gothic sensuality, high-heels and G-strings, women are poetic sexiness in motion and men lustful and justice enforcers (the true justice), there's an odd mix of old-school characterization and modernity, and the whole movie is so dizzyingly good you never have time to analyze, it's a film to enjoy, to be entertained with. And it's a fun movie where you know all the actors had fun playing in it. In a way, 'Sin City' is like Rodriguez' revenge on Tarantino, it's his own star-studded movie with Michael Madsen from 'Reservoir Dogs', Bruce Willis from 'Pulp Fiction' and a female casting instinct that has nothing to envy on Tarantino, from Rosario Dawson as a luscious dominatrix to the unforgettable Carla Gugino who makes quite an entrance in the film. But I must say Mickey Rourke makes the most durable impression, and I have the feeling that his come-back that pinnacled with 'The Wrestler' started with 'Sin City'.'Sin City' is a gem, one of the best films of the last decade, a masterpiece of Pop Culture, and Rodriguez' most mature and complete movie. He who asked his friend Tarantino to tell a joke in 'Desperado' asked him to direct a part in 'Sin City', it was the car scene between Clive Owen and Benicio Del Toro. I have less to say about that moment than this touching interaction between the two directors, there is something of Lucas and Coppola in them, Coppola was already an established director in 70's yet he always supported Lucas and encouraged him to push the envelope as best he could. In a way, 'Sin City' is Rodriguez' 'Star Wars'.",10,1,5,24 July 2015
Saboteur," A fix of pure Hitch stuff...
","Indeed, after having ventured in the atmosphere of early Hitchcock's movies and an anachronistic oddity titled 'Under Capricorn', 'Saboteur' provided me the same satisfaction an explorer who trotted over the globe for months would feel when crossing the threshold of his home. I missed the good old Hitchcock format to the point of homesickness and when the spinning Earth of Universal Pictures introduced that opening credits with a weird linear background and the ominous shadow of the titular 'Saboteur', I knew I was swimming in familiar water, I enjoyed every moment of the 1942 thriller, and forgave every flaw.Yes, there were flaws, the plots was written by three persons and I suspect they never met to get all their ducks in a row, but the action is so fast-paced and Hitchcock's directing so insolently confident that you savor every bit of this Swiss-cheese-like plot. They say Hitchcock was a Master of Suspense, I think he was hiding a subtler talent under his sleeve: he knew how to make you not notice the flaws. The action sequences, , the uses of ellipses and smash cuts, everything were so efficient that noticing a few weaknesses in the script would make you look nit-picky (not that all his films could got away with it).'Saboteur' opens with a sabotage of spectacular effect, a hatched-face guy named Fry bumped into two aircraft workers, one of them is Barry, played by Robert Cummings (and not Dana Andrews). Barry has enough time to check the name on a postcard. A few minutes later, a fire starts and Fry gives him an extinguisher, Barry's friend wants to take part to the action, ignoring that the extinguisher is filled with gasoline. Hitchcock gratifies with the death of a man literally eaten up by flames and falling like a burnt match. Now, this is an opening. What follows is pure Hitch stuff, Barry is the suspect number one because he handed the fatal extinguisher and naturally, there's no worker named Fry.Mistaken identities is one of Hitchcock's darling and it's handled quite efficiently in 'Saboteur' as Barry's identity is often the cause of misleading tricks with both the right and wrong side of the law, and can even be looked at the whole theme of the movie, which is about the fifth columnist threatening the United States' interests during the War. Indeed, 'Saboteur' can't be taken outside of its context, the decisive incident happens in the temple of the war effort after all. But the mistaken identity emphasizes the interesting contrast between the good guys and the villains, obviously. Those who trust Barry are all average Joes, down-on-their-luck, from the people, while the bad guys are very unlikely figures, a gentle grandfather played by Otto Kruger and a socialite played by Alma Kruger (no relation).One would think the film has a point to make about American values, and he would be right. During his road trip, Barry meets many archetypes of American society and these are opportunities for some grandiloquent speeches about democracy. Some are pretty well-written and I must say I have drank like little milk the lines delivered by Vaughan Masser, the blind host. Some others, as well-intended as they were, were too preachy. When Barry and Pat (Prscilla Lane) ask the circus troop workers for help, the Skeleton Man proposes a vote, when the midget protests, he's called 'fascist', which was a pretty bold answer. But then again, if the man was so eager to save them, why didn't he just help them? Is it better to make a bad decision democratically than a noble one tyrannically? kind of makes you think.I understand the context forced Hitchcock to inject some inspirational moments in his film, like he did in 'Loveboat', but this aspect was almost contradicted by the way the real folks behaved, the agents of FBI, the navy yard guards, all so conveniently incompetent, enough not to spot the bad guys or to arrest the wrong one so much for democracy. One would rather accept Barry's punchy methods, after all, it's not like he trusted the justice of his country and handed himself to the Law. You're never really sure what Hitch's point is, and maybe this is the film's slight edge over 'Lifeboat'. The Master gives the villain many shining moments, they sing to Tchaikov' music in a car, the suave villain a speech of his own and talk about 'mass morons', and even say bout totalitarian regimes that 'they get things done', and ironically, this is what the hero does, getting things done with the villains' methods.Despite these contradictions, the film lets itself being enjoyed, one scene after another, Hitchcock showcases his capability to provide memorable moments, a shootout in a Radio City theater with real shotguns heard in the movies, where the suspense lies on the moment the audience will realize what's going on, a paper with a message for help flying over the sky and last but not least, the Statue of Liberty's climax. What a fitting demise for the villain who sinned by fire to die at the altar of the Liberty torch. Yet even Hitchcock acknowledged a flaw: everyone wanted the villain to die. He wouldn't commit the same mistake in 'North by Northwest', but what a satisfying ending.As Fry, Norman Lloyd, without being the most memorable Hitchcok villain is the one whose face leaves the most vivid impact, and this is saying a lot in a film where they're a group of intimidating people. So we have memorable villains, a dark and handsome hero, mistaken for a killer, running afoul of the Law to prove his innocence and meeting in the process a beautiful blonde, car chases, last-minute escapes, bomb explosions, breath suspended as often as disbelief, and a climactic sequence taking place in the most unexpected and spectacular setting. I needed my fix of Hitchcock, and I got it with 'Saboteur'.",8,0,1,4 September 2016
Gangs of New York," Marty's ferocious retelling of America's history with New York as a microcosm ...
","American movies set during the late 19th century had a strange habit to feature cowboys, pioneers, Indians and sometimes Southern landlords, slaves, Union soldiers etc. Cinematically speaking, it was quite hard to figure how the Yankees were, how New York was like when the South and the West were being won. Maybe that's why Martin Scorsese, one of the greatest New Yorkers, repaired this injustice with 'Gangs of New York': a ferocious epic of blood, terror and anarchy, with New York as you've never seen it before.To say that New York's history didn't start until the 20th century is an understatement. However, the film leaves you with the feeling that New York was born after a bloody climactic massacre as painful as the delivery of a new city freed from anarchy, hate and intolerance after the mother died and all the pain with her. New York is depicted as a metaphor of America, with the gang battles as a Secession War on the streets, a War whose consequences could have been lethal, just as if the South had won. This is not a revision of history, but a retelling through the eyes of a New Yorker.In fact, the title is misleading, when we think of gangs and Scorsese (and New York), a gallery of unforgettable characters comes to mind, Charlie and Johnny Boy, Henry Hill, Jimmy Conway, Tommy De Vito etc. But in Marty's epic, the gangs are fighting for survival, they're robbers, thieves, whores, killers, like Travis Bickle's universe, one century earlier, with the Irish emigrants living like ants in a colony, in the never ending shelves of a hostile and disdaining city. How ironic that they are treated like foreigners and invaders by descendants of emigrants, calling themselves Natives. Indeed, New York's story is depicted with a poetic savagery, like the history of America in microcosm.Violence in this film, reaches such a level of gore and bestiality, we feel nostalgic thinking of good old guns. In fact, violence would inspire a whole thesis that couldn't fill this review, let's just say that people shout, cry, hit, pull knives in bellies, stomachs, legs  it's a snow reddening violence not for money or greed, but for survival. These are the primal instincts in the veins of the hands that built America, hands closed to become a fist, before they could shake other hands. And who else could have been the leader of these people, who else could have incarnated such bestial savagery but a villain named Bill the Butcher, played by an amazing Daniel Day-Lewis?Daniel Day-Lewis is the soul of this film, a charismatic villain profoundly attached to the Five Points, his territory. This sacred link was sealed after the spectacular victory against the Dead Rabbits, the Irish gang whose leader, 'Priest' Vallon (Liam Neeson) was killed by Bill's bare hands in front of his son, Amsterdam. 16 years later after, fate puts Amsterdam (Leonardo Di Caprio) in Bill's path. He becomes his protégé, inspiring Bill's fatherly instinct. Of course, the Shakespearian aspect of the story can't avoid some stereotypical un-Scorsesian situations, the revenge story, and the romance with Jenny (Cameron Diaz) the pick pocket expert, which I have always thought to be too pretty for that role, and Amsterdam not the most colorful character of the film (nothing against Leo's performance, but Daniel Day-Lewis puts so much charisma and energy in his role, he'd make anyone look dull)Fortunately, these details don't hurt the film; the writing is sometimes so good it elevates the traditional Scorsesian dilemma to epic proportions. Amsterdam might not be Bickle, Archer, LaMotta, but we feel for him. To accomplish his duty, to avenge his father, he needed Bill's trust and sympathy, even if the price was to kill and to be betrayed by his own blood. But the intelligence of the script, an element not to be underestimated, is that it makes you realize that this guilt is driven by the same racialist instinct that ignited the hate. Therefore, Amsterdam won't redeem his soul by killing Bill the Butcher but by ending his dictatorship, and killing the evil spirit about to poison the whole dream of New York City, freedom and brotherhood, America's epitome.That's how the story transcends Amsterdam's dilemma, it's not just the Irish, there are Black, Chinese, people from lower classes, every layer of what'll build tomorrow's society, who'll fight for their right to live and to be respected in this country, it's like a Civil War in one town, a war leading to one of the most spectacular climactic battle sequences in a movie, where basically, everyone fights, men, women, rich, poor, police, fire fighters etc. Violence is so bloodily chaotic it's like America finally exorcising all the demons in the most violent way, which in Scorsese's vision means the most redeeming. How ironic that people who didn't want to go to War took part in another war anyway. And the municipal resources deployed to end the massacre were so important it spared no one and created a posthumous union, symbolized by the last confrontation between Bill and Amsterdam. Bill dies a true American, unaware that his death gave birth to a new real American spirit.Bill's death was Amsterdam's redemption. But the central character of this film is not Amsterdam, or Bill or any member of any gang, the central character is New York, as the town of all the ideals, hopes and fears America represented. The town sinned through disunion and was redeemed by blood. You don't make up for your sins in church you do it in the streets ... No wonder this is the town that most symbolizes America, and that only Marty could have made such a powerful film.",8,0,0,9 February 2011
Braveheart," Glorious epic and guts-directing at its best ...
","Cinematically speaking, Mel Gibson's 'Braveheart' is a triumphal homage to a kind of old-school entertainment that deserted the big screens during the cynical 90's. And I believe that the controversy surrounding its Best Picture win has more to do with the degradation of Gibson's public image, than the content of his film which is no better, no worse than some antagonist's portrayal found in Spielberg's movie..Now, to 'Braveheart': with this catchy title, Mel Gibson delivers a flamboyant epic that pays homage to one of the greatest Scottish heroes, William Wallace. Therefore, he finds the perfect tone required for such portrayals: it's grandiose without being over-the-top, it builds a legend but not a myth. Gibson, with a remarkable craftsmanship, draws the perfect line between historical accuracy and legend and the way 'Braveheart' oscillates between these two aspects is the true measure of the film's greatness both in the form and in the content.Indeed, when historical accuracy can be questioned, the film is immediately redeemed by some of the bloodiest and most realistic battle scenes ever filmed, and when the myth is too big to be believable, the story is elevated to a sort of abstract and hypnotic beauty, conveying the feeling of a myth that historians couldn't properly reach. 'Braveheart' is like a 'Gladiator' with a ferocious and passionate heart pumping and driving its dynamics, with a thrilling thirst of fights and battle, and what makes it superior than 'Gladiator' rely on a famous quote from this film : 'Are you not entertained?' Mel Gibson won two Oscars on that 1996, for Best Director and Best Picture. Both satisfy me, but the directing one, even more. Gibson's talent behind the camera literally implodes on our faces and is as much a revelation, as the existence of this William Wallace figure, now, a cinematic legend. Gibson is so talented that he doesn't even take for granted his story's material, after all, with a handsome hero who leads a revolt against an invader, you can't fail, just copy some respected epics, such as 'Lawrence of Arabia', add some complexity on the character, make his handsome, and brave with a wound in his heart, and use the biggest part of the budget on the battles. Really? If the recipe was so sure, there wouldn't be so many epics that sunk into oblivion, think of all the post-'Braveheart' films, the 'Troy', 'Alexander', not to mention the infamous 'Vercingétorix', all these movies were probably less controversial than 'Braveheart' but less memorable as well. Gibson doesn't do an epic for the sake of it, and it shows, he wants also to tell us a story and to make it believable. His battles are more than two crowds of soldier colliding for a bloody mess, there is military strategy in 'Braveheart', warfare. If you pay attention, you may quickly realize that beyond the historical setting, 'Braveheart' is also one of the greatest and most convincing war films.And the storytelling extends the limits of the war. Wallace is not just a leader painting his face in white and blue, he's the exaltation of the romantic figure in such a modern way it can feel anachronic. He's the quintessential hero, charismatic as hell, handsome, sweet and gentle or ferocious and impetuous when duty calls but also vulnerable and overly idealistic. Mel Gibson signs an extraordinary performance on an Oscar worthy level. So when the film opens with these lines 'You may call me a liar, but history is written by those who hang heroes', which is a subtle way to leave the benefit of doubt to the story. At the end, we're intelligent enough to make the difference and Gibson trusts this very intelligence.Maybe Wallace was not that 'perfect', maybe Edward Longshanks (Patrick McGoohan) was not such a ruthless and evil man and his son an effeminate weakling, but these considerations hardly matter in a spectacular film like 'Braveheart'. Yes, it's Manichean, yes it emphasizes the hero's value and demonise the villains but would have the film worked better on the field of political correctness.. By the way, to those who criticized the one-dimensional portrayal of British, I thought that the portrayal of the Scottish nobles as morally corrupted men was harsher than the British, who were only defending their interests.Again, I suspect these critics are influenced by the many controversies that affected Mel Gibson's career recently. People are now so eager to prove that he's a racist bigot, that 'Braveheart' is used as the most blatant alibi. What I see in 'Braveheart' is not a racist film but the birth of a cinematic talent, free-spirited, independent and bold in its depiction of violence, in 'Braveheart', the violence displayed in 'Apocalypto' and 'The Passion of Christ' are hinted. In an era where many acclaimed directors lose their touch like Scorsese and Tarantino, Gibson knows how to associate guts. Everything is efficient on every cinematic level, the cinematography, the editing, the beautiful music from James Horner and maybe more than that, the acting.Every actor shines within the limits of his role and manages to transcend the conventions applying to their characters, McGoohan is magnificently evil as the demoniac King and while we're shocked by some of his lines and actions, we can't help but respect the Machicavellian genius, Sophie Marceau and Catherine McCornick are equally good in the two female characters who'll conquer Wallace's heart, while Brendan Gleeson is the perfect gentle brute sidekick. And Angus McFayden deserves a worthy mention as Robert the Bruce, the tortured man torn between his admiration toward Wallace and his ambition to get on the throne.'Braveheart' is also an insightful journey into warfare, politics and Machiavellism, but more than that, transcended, by Mel Gibson's mind-blowing talent in both acting and directing, it's also pure entertaining and one hell of a film.",10,1,4,28 May 2012
True Romance," The Amazing Story of a Bullet-Proof Love ...
","There's one thing that 'True Romance' doesn't lie about: its title. The romance is the core of the story and the soul of the movie from beginning to end. As soon as Clarence Whitman (Christian Slater), a comic-book vendor, fan of Elvis Presley and old Kung-Fu films -translation: a geek- meets Alabama Parker (Patricia Arquette), a hooker, we know and we feel that for each step one would make, the other would follow.What is extraordinary in Tony Scott's film is how it detaches itself from both action films where romances are usually reduced to cheesy subplots, and from romances since the two protagonists fall in love in a very surprising immediacy. No time for build-ups, for growing complicity, for love-and-hate wisecracks, 'True Romance' echoes the classic loves-at-first-sight movies such as 'West Side Story', 'Romeo and Juliet' or any Disney film. It's a deliberate naivety enabling us to keep our hearts hooked to two endearing characters, trapped in a world of drugs and shotguns, where a bullet can hit you faster than love. The romance defines the couple's new life but also their new quest: living together in peace.And there's this dreamlike feeling conveyed by Hans Zimmer's score. The 'You're So Cool' theme is so close to Gassenhauer's music it clearly indicates that the film is a homage to Terrence Malick's 'Badlands'. But while 'Badlands' was about crime in a romantic setting, 'True Romance' is a romance in a criminal setting. One is a nihilistic escape; the other is much more idealistic. Clarence and Alabama try to find a new path for their lives and escape from cops and gangsters, both equally antagonistic. Their escape is materialized by the 'Caribbean' tone of Zimmer's music, playful, sweet with a child-like lullaby purity, embodying a beautiful dream. And the closer they get to their dreams, the louder the music is, culminating with a powerful ending.And the dream's beauty is worth the deadly price. The dream-like nature of the romance illustrated by the music creates the perfect contrast with its sordid setting, allowing the story to create a dichotomy between love and violence with passion as their common link. The treatment of violence parallels love's connection to the future: it's less the violent moments that scare but the way they are patiently built up. Four times, the movie involves a confrontation where one has no chance AND nothing to lose, except a beloved one. And these scenes are cleverly slow paced and punctuated with thrilling exchanges, just to let us time to revise our prognostics. On that level, 'True Romance' stands alone as one of the greatest action thrillers for four specific scenes magnificently written.The first scene seals the union between Clarence and Alabama when he decides to 'buy' her from Drexl. The pimp, played by Gary Oldman in a terrifying mix between Taxi Driver's Spot and Norman Stansfield, is defeated by the geeky Clarence who wins Alabama's freedom plus a briefcase of cocaine that would start the whole trouble with the Mafia and the Police. The second scene is probably the most praised and mainly remembered for its confrontation between two acting Gods: Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper, the deliverer of the infamous 'Sicily' monologue. These two scenes alone deserve to be mentioned among the best pieces of screen-writing from the last 20 years; from Clarence's bluffing confidence in the way he retells all the trivia about an obscure blaxploitation film airing on TV, to the story of Sicilians having African heritage that would have made Vito Corleone roll over his grave.The third scene involves a disturbing fight between the future Tony Soprano, James Gandolfini, and poor Patricia Arquette, the fight is so unequal that it's physically painful to see that poor creature beaten to death by that big thug. Yet, it powerfully serves the idea that one having nothing to lose can develops a superhuman strength. The last scene is the pay-off of the entire intricate plot, a Mexican stand-off where all the protagonists meet: the cops, the snitch, the dealers, the Mafia, Clarence and Alabama, for a final mayhem of bullets. 'True Romance' is also a true thriller and a film served by great supporting performances through roles with extremely short life expectancies. Still, all these scenes have less in common their violence than the way they romanticize violence as the only answer when one has nothing to lose, where there's no passion without pain, no triumph without hardship. Whether it's Clarence challenging Drexl, his father provoking Cocotti or Alabama against Virgil, it's all about love.These scenes have another thing in common, they break taboos, cops die as casually as bandits, a man beats a woman, the ultimate insult to the Sicilians is made, and a ruthless pimp is defeated by a poor geek, fan of Elvis  The script defies all our conceptions of gangster and crime movies, playing both on the field of homage and iconoclasm. It's like the dream of a movie fan who's finally got the big role in the film, and this embodies the whole dream-like aspect of 'True Romance', something transcended by the ending and sublimated by the last lines, some of the best I've ever heard in a film. The movie is pure geek-escapism but written with so much confidence that it refreshes all the dusty heritage of a genre as old as cinema, with a harrowing fantasy dimension.I mentioned before that Tony Scott's 'The Last Boy Scout' had an entertaining value because we didn't have to care much for the plot, here not only we care for the story but also for the characters, and this is why the film is one of the few that belongs to the writer more than the director, a movie written by a man who loved films so much he decided to tell them his way... a young movie genius named Quentin Tarantino.",9,1,4,6 January 2012
Her," Love as a one-sided fantasy and two-sided tragedy...
","'Being John Malkovich' and 'Adaptation.'.explored the human gift for transcendence, whether by taking distance from reality in order to explore your deeper needs, or being alienated by the power of imagination, in other words: they dealt with fantasy.Those were movies directed by Spike Jonze but all the credit went to Charlie Kaufman, a real revelation on the field of creative storytelling. Kaufman would finally win an Oscar with 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind', another masterpiece that explores the limitations of fantasy when confronted to reality. And while watching 'Her', I couldn't stop thinking of Kaufman, there is no doubt he influenced Jonze, but this is a Jonze's movie, written and directed by.In 'Her', he explores romance and love in the realm of modernity and technological advances, through a unique and believable relationship between a lonely man named Theodore and Samantha, an OS with the voice of Scarlett Johansen. The OS is the name of a program that creates a virtual conscience responsive to any possible needs. The film is set in a futuristic world where voices replaced the fingers, you can listen to your mails, delete or answer them, you can select music just by using your voice. The OS can do that but it can be more, it can even be things it doesn't know yet, and one thing it is for sure, is one of the greatest MacGuffin of recent cinema's history.And the film doesn't try to over-exploit the Sci-fi format, it deals with the romances and uses the OS in order to comment on our very visions of love in our technological age. And on that level, I've never felt as deeply connected to a character than I was with Theodore. His experience and relationship with women and Samantha in particular spoke very deeply in my heart. Joaquin Phoenix could have played it like an awkward Woody Allen figure, full of crazy mimics or mannerisms but he's a nice, ordinary guy who's just went through a very close relationship with Catherine (Rooney Mara) and had to break up, because he couldn't handle the changes and the subsequent fears.Theodore embodies the notion of love as either an evolving process or one that has to cope with the evolution of the persons, but what if their evolution don't converge, or is it even possible to engage in a commune evolution without sacrificing one part of yourself. When does your standpoint start to matter? And what if one of the two parties is domineering? That's precisely the case of Amy, Theodore's neighbor, played by Amy Adams, who couldn't stand anymore her control-freak husband. And her situation indirectly points out the edge of Theodore, who lives a break-up proof relationship with Samantha for a simple reason: it's a one-sided love, you don't have to make concessions.There's one painful scene where a date goes too perfect to be true between Theodore and Olivia Wilde and it goes all wrong when she asks him if he wants to be serious. How many dates did I want to seize the perfection of the moment without longing for another encounter? Sometimes, you embrace the delight of the moment without wishing for a repetition. That's the limit of our virtual vision of love, even with a real person, you'd rather have the temporary illusion of perfection than its fading effect over the passing of years. 'Her' is so spot-on many times that it's almost painful to watch, this is a film made by someone who know how relationships start and how they end. That Amy's separation is due to pointless arguments speak thousand words, how many roads to divorce were paved by pointless arguments, rather than existential blocks? And today, more than any other time, love is weakened by the availability of options. If we break something, we fix it, but when a heart is broken, you believe it will be naturally fixed through another relationship. It is not cynical, that's the way it is. And its portrayal of a futuristic world where everything can be easily be done with a combination of complex processes works on a prophetic level because you can see this is not so distant from our reality. Speaking for myself, I remember a time where chatting with someone was the most exhilarating sensation ever, we didn't even need to meet, then after AOL, MSN came, and it allowed many people who were too shy for girls to make up for the lost time. But I was married before Tinder application was made and I can't imagine how now it became easy to have sex.This is not even explored in 'Her', because love, rather than sex, is the focal point and Theodore isn't concerned by physical contact (otherwise, Samantha would've been useless). 'Her' explores how far you can get with the technological evolution when it comes to fulfill your need for love, what is the catch? Maybe, when things get too easy, they get easily out of control, if a program is sophisticated enough to have one soul-mate, it can have 2, 3, as many as it can get, where's the power of love? Same goes with Tinder, if you can have one partner, why not, two? Why even marrying? Isn't monogamy out-dated anyway? The merit of Jonze's script, one that had swept all the screenplay awards, is to use a very specific set-up to create situations we can relate to. This is powerful film-making, served by a fantastic performance by Joaquin Phoenix as a real sponge for emotions. In the end, 'Her' doesn't say exactly if we can still love today, but that love is such a fundamental part of living, no human should be excluded from that journey.No matter the way you choose to love or be loved, you must experience love, the real way, the hard way.",9,0,1,15 March 2017
Slumdog Millionaire," Question 1. How was 'Slumdog Millionaire' ruined by the last ten minutes ?
","ANSWER A. Jamel's final won wasn't destiny, it was pure luck, which was in total contradiction with the message of the film.------------------------------------------------------ ---------------------------------- ------------------------------------<ul><li>The structure of 'Slumdog Millionnaire''s script was based on a simple premise : Jamal, a slum boy wins in the 'Who Wants to be a Millionnaire' game because every question has a connection with something that happened in his life. Original and clever, this was the basis of the film : Jamal's destiny was to win, because his destiny made him know all the answers. </li></ul><ul><li>It's never been luck. Even at the 50-50 question, when the TV host gives him the wrong answer in the toilet, he's indirectly guiding Jamal who naturally chose the other option because he learned from his past not to trust anyone. Everything had a connection with his life. </li></ul><ul><li>Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying Jamal shouldn't have given the right answer, but the way he did betrayed the spirit of the film. Jamal says 'Answer A' and then 'A' rhymes with Deus Ex Machina.</li></ul>* Some would say : 'that was the point, he didn't care about winning, he knew Latika would be with him from that day and that's what mattered to him. He had the love of his life, he didn't care for money' Then, let's go to Answer B.ANSWER B. Because Latika was the most important thing, Jamal shouldn't have won the game. ----------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------- <ul><li>He loved Latika, he played the game to be rich enough to provide a good living for the love of his life. BUT Latika didn't care : remember, she came at the rendezvous in the train station. She loved Jamel, rich or poor. </li></ul><ul><li>Now, let's say the game was important, because it was the only way so Latika could reach Jamal, as long as she escapes from the house. I accept the idea of Salim (the brother) deciding to free Latika as a redeeming act. Then, all she has to do is to find Jamal. Then Latika sees Jamal on TV, she remembers about the cell-phone, she answers, she declares her love, BUT Jamel gives the wrong answer. </li></ul><ul><li>The movie needed a happy ending, but Jamal with Latika was the perfect happy ending. And it would have been a legendary twist ending, everybody expect Jamal to win, but he doesn't, he only wins Latika's heart, THAT'S a beautiful and modern fairy tale. </li></ul><ul><li>To give you an example, Jamal having Latika AND the money felt like a forced artificial ending, like Rocky Balboa winning the fight against Apollo. All Rocky wanted to do was to go the distance. All Jamal wanted was Latika.</li></ul>* Some would say 'It was Jamal's destiny to win, the whole point was that he had to go from wags to riches, people wanted an underdog story' Then, let's go to Answer C.ANSWER C. Latika should have been the one who gave him the right answer. ---------------------------------------------- --------------------------------<ul><li>Think about it, every protagonist in Jamal's life played a big role in his knowledge of the right answers, Salim for the 'Colt', the poor blind kid for 'Benjamin Franklyn', his mother for the Hindu question etc. Imagine if Latika knew about the answer, how magical it would have been : the most important question of the game, and he knows the answer thanks to Latika. </li></ul><ul><li>Imagine how the climactic scene would have been even more thrilling, she hears the phone ringing on TV, she realizes she left it in the car then we would have been like 'Faster, Latika!' What a hell of a climax if we knew she knew the right answer, making Jamal rich and still having the opportunity to say 'I love you'</li></ul>* But the point is that they never knew the answer, how could Latika know?<ul><li>That's simple, she was in a crowded street, full of thousands of people, she could have heard anyone say 'Answer A' : that would have been simple, plausible, and leading to a more brilliant climax. </li></ul><ul><li>Instead, she just says 'I don't know', and Jamel who doesn't even care still gives the right answer! Anticlimactic, yes, ironic, maybe, but don't start with the whole 'destiny' thing, if it was Jamal's destiny to win, then every single thing that took part in his life would have helped him to know the answer. </li></ul><ul><li>And in that last case, it would have been Latika's intervention. Isn't she part of Jamal's destiny after all. Instead of that, Jamal had the money and the girl, and the whole celebration thing.</li></ul>* Some would say 'that's what people wanted, he had the girl and the money, it had to be a happy ending' Then, let's go to Answer D.ANSWER D. Because of the forced stereotypical Bollywood happy ending.-------------------------------------- --------------------------------------<ul><li>That probably explains all the previous criticism. It seemed like Danny Boyle wanted to please the foreign audience, to remind them that they were watching an 'Indian' film. How condescending to support the cliché that any Bollywood film should end with a musical choreography, even for a drama handling very serious subjects. </li></ul><ul><li>That's how you start a great film with an incredible screenplay, and ruin it with one of the most forced and badly written endings. Maybe the whole stupid choreography at the end was intended to confirm that the movie wasn't to be taken seriously.</li></ul>« Slumdog Millionaire » is the perfect example of a great film ruined by the last ten minutes and inspiring in terms of 'story-revisionism'. The movie had all the elements to be considered one of the greatest of the last decade, all it needed was a good ending. And this is my final answer.",6,2,5,12 January 2011
Mad Max: Fury Road," Who said women were bad drivers?
","This is not sexism but only a joke in response to the radical feminism that seemed to be fueling every major franchise reboot today... with the exception of 'Rocky'.Let's start positively: 'Fury Road' provides the most spectacular chases of all the tetralogy but the film is only 'The General' with bigger stunts though what made Buster Keaton's film appreciable is that he risked his neck. And I still have a fondness for 'Road Warrior' over-the-top climax and the 'Plane, Train and Automobiles' sequence concluding 'Thunderdome'... speaking of which, we're talking of a 30-year time span between the last movies and that he could pull effect both practical and effective to an audience raised by the digital revolution is perhaps the best stunt of all. Now, forgive my sophism but it takes more than action to make action movies work and 'Fury Road' was so stuck to the steering wheel it took its driver for granted.The first might be the slowest or the least thrilling of the four but that's how we were introduced to Max Rockatansky, his skills, his humility, his tormenting hesitation between settling down and sticking with the family or hitting the road to fight the filth of the Earth. The whole exposition culminated with the tragic loss of his wife and baby child. In the next films, Max had won its status as a pop-culture hero, he resented that word but that was part of his persona. 'Fury Road' doesn't embarrass itself with such technicalities, if makes Furiosa an immediate heroine, a Joan of Arc without any character's arc.The character had potential but she was as semi-developed character as as if we had met Sarah Connor in 'Terminator 2' or Ellen Ripley in 'Aliens'. These heroines were fascinating not only for their backstory as non-warrior characters but for the fact that they weren't handled like flashbacks but as true plot drivers. Furiosa is strong and bad-ass already and God forbids Mel Gibson would be an aging Mad Max playing her mentor (too controversial), or for her to show any semblance of vulnerability (too taboo).And as the emotionless, shaved-headed heroine (à la Joan of Arc indeed) she displays traits that play like ersatz of masculinity, cliché even by guy-movies standard. Tough, hardly talking, always right, Furiosa doesn't even shed a tear when one of the 'breeders' die or when she discovers the sad truth about the Green Place. I simply don't get what is so appealing in overly confident characters. Think of many icons, Michael Corleone didn't want to be a mobster, Travis Bickle started as Mr. Nice Guy, Rocky was a bum, characters who are perfect from the start might kick ass but they're ultimately boring, and a 120-format with 10% minutes for dialogues made of 90% of grunting doesn't help.Still, one can appreciate the post-apocalyptic elements, violence, regression, the rarefaction of oil and water, but the first films covered all these speculative aspects. 'Fury Road' just takes one step forward, after settlers vs. gangs, then marauders vs. migrants, then new glimpses of civilization, it's fair to imagine a neo-fascist world ruled by men and relegating women to their primitive functions: breeding and nurturing. There's something visionary in the way the film switches from the usual horizontal struggle (nomads vs. settlers) to vertical domination, but it also implies that in order to survive, women must display the same skills as men, elevating driving and fighting as Darwinian assets.The film suggest matriarchy and self-determination as salutary options, after all the plot is about 'selected' women being freed by one of them. So basically, the alternative from being locked away by men is to be their own master. The problem is that unlike the previous films where children were present among settlers, 'Fury Road' is rather pessimistic, implying that couples won't exist. And since the feminist take doesn't disregard the necessity to have children (for the survival of mankind), one must consider how they will have them if not by exploiting or using men as well. This feminism ironically depends on power perceptions inherited from men. Is it such a coincidence that all the fugitives are beautiful and the obese milk providers are left to their condition?The film contains some epic-looking images and thrilling sequences but with a rather thin and manipulative plot served by very one-dimensional characters, and that goes for Furiosa too. She shares so many skills and personality traits with Max that I kept wondering what was Max' role exactly, except to be a foil for Furiosa, exactly what happened between Han Solo and Rey when she told him she could handle herself. And the film ends with the same acknowledgement from the original hero, foreshadowed by the name of Charlize Theron put above Tom Hardy in the opening shot.This is not a hierarchy to trivialize, once again, we have a film where every man is flawed, weak and ironically, this is something I won't complain about because the War boys were touching in their twisted away and I liked Immortan Joe for even that scary dude had a weak spot. But 'Fury Road' works exactly like 'The Force Awakens', the new 'Ghostbusters' movie, 'Toy Story 4' or even 'Blade Runner 2049', it recycles plots with that radical anti-male perspective, it's like the sole purpose of these reboots is to cure classics from misogyny they didn't have.Because even the first 'Mad Max' films had strong female characters, the old lady in the first, Max' wife that he failed to save, and Tina Turner who spares his life at the end of 'Thunderdome', another thing they had in common: they were fun to watch, I wish one character could make us smile or chuckle at least once.A product of its preachy and pedant era, the film takes itself too seriously and this is why it's my least favorite.",6,1,3,13 September 2019
Hacksaw Ridge," Sticking to his guns by refusing to carry them...
","Patton said that no 'bastard' ever won a war by dying for his country but by making the other poor, dumb bastard die. Well, that wraps it quite well, war is all about death, but to admit it is also to ignore that figures like Desmond Doss existed, and bringing his extraordinary story to the big screen is enough a reason to praise Mel Gibson.And who would have thought that the 2017 line-up of Oscar-nominated directors would feature him? Oscar pundits expected many first-time nominees such as Chazelle, Jenkins, or Villeneneuve but if there ever was a spot to be occupied by a veteran, it belonged to either Scorsese or Eastwood. I'm glad Hollywood is a more forgiving place than we believed and that the members can see talent when it hit them in the face, to the point of rehabilitating 'Mad Mel'.Because, there is no doubt that when you finish 'Hacksaw Ridge', you know there's no director who depicts heart-pounding battle sequences and heart-breaking characters like he does. This is the stuff the Academy can't ignore because it has a superb (true) story, it is well acted and directed and has this 'heart' element that can wow any audience. Comparisons with 'Saving Private Ryan' are inevitable, but I hold this film in higher consideration because Gibson already proved his talent when it came to handle battle sequences and violence in 'Braveheart', three years before Spielberg.But there is a more profound reason to admire 'Hacksaw Ridge', while it portrays soldiers as heroes, it doesn't demonize the Japanese soldiers either, and we don't cheer at their demise. The movie is a humanistic masterpiece that transcends skin considerations, the fact that Doss also saves Japanese soldiers and that some can be seen committing acts of Bushido, prove that this is not a film about 'winning a war', but about not letting war defeat our humanity. Unfortunately, this aspect was overlooked, as marked by the seal of Gibson's infamy. Well, not only this is one hell of a film, but it is even better because you can tell it's from Gibson.Desmond Doss was the conscience objector who saved more than seventy lives in one of Okinawa's bloodiest slaughters without ever carrying a rifle, which makes him a purely Gibsonian, so to speak, character, as a vulnerable man caught in existential conflicts but moving forward nonetheless, finding strength in a totally unshakable Christian faith. Maybe that's the sensitive nerve the movie hits, especially from a director whose Christianity was spoiled by a fallacious association with anti-Semitism. But the film isn't about Christian faith, but plain faith, and one driven by positive values. After all, even a non-religious person can admit that 'Thou Shall Not Kill' is universally humanistic.Desmond Doss belongs to that category of inspirational characters like Sir Thomas More or Frank Serpico; men who (maybe naively) believed in simple principles but never sold their soul out for the whole world, not even the call of duty. Doss refuses to carry a rifle, but not to go to the battle, as a medic, he won't kill people but save them. Andrew Garfield plays a character whose sweetness, sensibility and optimism contrast with the world he lives in, and he sort of gives you back a faith in humanity, severely undermined by this depressing year, and it tells you something about Gibson, he might seem to insist on violence, but it is always to emphasize the courage of the peaceful side.Like War, 'Hacksaw Ridge' reveals both the worst and the best of humanity. This is no nihilistic, apocalyptic movie, the horror in the war scenes is brutal and gory as you might expect and they certainly earned Gibson his directing nod, but overall, the film is about this humble, modest, slender, thin man who wasn't focused on the killing, but on the healing role he could play in the midst of this barbarity. Soldiers' goal is 'death to the enemy' but when they leave the battleground and there's no one to kill anymore, saving lives become the only possible option.And this is the revelation, when Doss meets his destiny and transcends his condition, praying God, for nothing more than 'saving one more life', a powerful moment that echoes the 'I could have saved more' in 'Schindler's List'. It is quite an extraordinary achievement when the war scenes not only provide the most spectacular moments of the film, but also add to the depth of the characters, and the perception of Doss makes a 180° turn, as he goes from a coward to a living saint. The climax of the film is such a moving and emotional sequence that it redeems all the little flaws.I wasn't that impressed by the beginning which was pretty sentimental, but I remember I had similar feelings with the first act of Oliver Stone's 'Born on the Fourth of July'. Still, the back story provided some interesting hints on Doss' pacifist nature, including the personality of Hugo Weaving as his father, a bitter and alcoholic Great War veteran who sealed Doss' defiance toward guns and Teresa Palmer, his understanding fiancée. And when the boot camp sequence kicks off, the film is enriched by the performances of Vince Vaughn as the sergeant, Luke Bracey and Sam Worthington, and then, the final act justifies why the film needed this seemingly conventional start.Indeed, since when is conventionality a flaw when it comes to portray unconventional characters? Doss is perhaps one of the best revelations of 2016, if everyone respects the WW2 veterans for their courage, they'll admire Doss who made world a better place at a worst possible time. 'Hacksaw Ridge' is the testament to a man's extraordinary moral integrity and the miracle he accomplished ... and a director's unique talent, finally rehabilitated. Maybe an even more impressive miracle.",9,3,7,5 February 2017
The Breakfast Club," The coming-of-age classic where even the clichés and cornier elements contain shades of truth...
","From Homer meeting Marge to the five high-school students' epiphany in 'The Breakfast Club', it seems like only good things can happen during detention, it is probably true and now that I'm twice the age I was when I could live such opportunity, I can only mourn the incompleteness of my youth, desperately devoid of such heart- to-heart conversations that can make a difference over the course of one's life.Yes, I wish I hadn't tried to avoid these situations like leper. See, I was the class brain and I could relate to the pressure endured by the character of Anthony Michael Hall, the obsession with marks, grade, the constant need to please the hierarchy whether in school or at home. And when I thought that maybe I could make a good comic-book drawer and live out of my passion, it was too late, I had lost all credibility in front of my papers, and I couldn't believe it myself. Only at the age of 35, I'm still recovering from unemployment, trying to reassemble the pieces of the puzzle and trying to achieve one tenth the dreams, or let's call them 'the projects' I had.Sorry I'm losing space for my own shenanigans, but retrospectively, thanks to 'The Breakfast Club' 'or because of it, I realized that I didn't get the right advice and didn't enjoy the teenage years as it is supposed to be enjoyed. Of course, the movie doesn't imply that it is a time to be enjoyed, but most certainly to be cherished and embraced because this is exactly when you can figure out what kind of path you want to draw to your life. It's perhaps the most important moment in your life when you must learn to say 'no'. The five kids who get reunited in detention possess varying degree of strength and conviction, but the point of the film is that combining their forces together, they'll learn to say 'no'. I wish I could have the power to say 'no'.And I still don't know whether I blame my parents or myself. This is quite well captured by John Hughes, this sort of in-between situation, the film doesn't necessarily put the blame on the parents but rather express in the youth' awkward way the resentment we have toward ourselves for not being capable to stand for our beliefs. That's what leaving childhood is about, stopping to behave like children and act according to your vision of things. Sure your parents 'know better' but they know from their own experience, the point of life is to live your own experience. Besides, the film isn't entirely against the parents since it also questions the power of peer pressure and 'friends'. It's all about useless burdens that prevent you from being yourself, or trying to.I don't like playing the labeling game although I'm aware this is what drove the writing but well, here it is there's Andrew the jock (Emilio Estevez), the wrestling champion who actually shares many similarities with the brain, Brian (Hall) both have parents pressuring them to be the best, to collect grades and points. Yet Andrew is handsome, good-looking capable to handle himself while Brian can't only perceive life under the prism of pleasing whoever provides the rating. He reminds me of Lisa Simpson's need to have a mark when the teachers were on strike. There's the pampered prom-queen, Claire (Molly Ringwald) she's rather open-minded, well- spoken but can't seem to get rid of her precious/prude image. Allison (Ally Sheedy), the other girl is the total opposite (Ally Sheedy) Gothic, making noises and acting as if she belonged to some institution.The real catalysis of the communication process is the bad boy John Bender played by Judd Nelson, the guy is the authentic rebel and by teasing each one, gives enough rope to anyone to vent their anger, let the hearts talk and make the whole movie happen. His strong antagonism with the mean principal Vernon (Paul Gleason) escalates to a real personal hatred, which mirrors the problems he's got with his own abusive father. Granted it's not the most earthshaking revelation, but it seems interesting that the most confident of all the guys and the one who actually gets the 'pretty girl' is the one with troubled parents. I don't know if Brian felt the way I did, but sometimes I wish I was more of a Nelson, you know tough guy toughened by life. And you know why? Because you'll always have an excuse to behave like a thug, but never like a wimp. And girls hate wimps anyway. So for all the verbal abuse, Claire was victim of, she ended up giving him a tender hickey. And for all her attempts to pass as a weirdo, Ally surrendered to the call of femininity and after a makeup session with Claire, caught the eye of Andrew. And for all his gentleness and complicity with Ally, Brian was still a virgin at the end. You call them clichés? Not at all, the film highlight one important aspect of being a teen, a paradoxical need to conform to other norms than yours, all they need is a catalysis, some marijuana, some make up, anything, but while praising non-conformity, each one paradoxically conforms himself to another model.The film isn't totally flawless, I don't care much about the actors looking too old for their parts since the message is more important than the messenger, I just wished the adults were portrayed in a more three-dimensional way and that the characters' arc didn't involve some clichés such as the ugly ducklings and girls love bad boys. But even when it uses clichés, they're actually more truthful than pseudo messages about being yourself. The film works and when it doesn't, it still hit a chord of truth.",8,1,2,18 September 2017
Gladiator," The film that 'won' the crowds of the new millennium...
","In 2003, the American Film Institute presented the Top 100 Screen-Characters, fifty each in the hero and villain category, with the fiftieth spots belonging to the most recent characters: Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington) from 'Training Day' was the last bad guy and in the heroic department: General Maximum Decimus Meridius, Russel Crowe as the titular 'Gladiator'. His reputation outgrew 'Training Day' and deservedly so, as the film not only resurrected the 'swords and sandals' genre but a new trend of spectacular entertainment that defined film-making of the new millennium.Like Jesus Christ in the Antiquity timing, there would be a before and an after 'Gladiator' and like Caesar, one's got to give Ridley Scott the credit he deserves. He didn't use CGI for the sake of special effects but for storytelling, it was still the post-'Titanic' era where CGI was used for the sinking, but the rest was made of flesh, props and bones, 'The Phantom Menace' had CGI as vital as the actors, maybe more, but Scott used them to recreate the Coliseum, to make the cheerful crowds look real, to transport us into a universe that had deserted screens ever since the 60's: Antique Rome, as if its historical fall had spread to Hollywood. The use of CGI isn't perfect but it is the job of the story to distract your eyes and mind so that you won't try to spot the flaw, and speaking for myself, I was so enthralled by the story that I didn't even want to spot any flaw.Indeed, the real power of 'Gladiator' is in the story, one of disconcerting simplicity, whose pitch could take indeed the time of an elevator ride but the treatment and the performances enrich it with a Shakespearian texture. You can say it's a story of an ambitious son who kills his father, Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) to prevent him from restoring the power to the people, but the performance of Joaquin Phoenix is of a dark, brooding and twisted man who can't stand the paternal rejection and surrenders to the reality of his own wickedness and commits the irreparable act. You can almost feel Commodus killing a part of himself with his father, the only shade of goodness left in his heart. If he can't rule because he's too amoral, so be it, and let's start a descent that will go as far as turning the victor of the Barbarians into a mortal enemy.Yes, I started with the villain, but it's the villain that gives its flavor to the film, and Commodus encompasses such a high degree of corruption that he inevitably highlights the straight morality of Maximus, his father's most faithful lieutenant, the son he wished he had. Oscar-winning Russell Crowe plays the general with enough depth and passion to be as believable as Mel Gibson when he played William Wallace (Gibson was the initial choice) but the real power of Crowe is to keep a low profile, never overplay the heroism figure, he's a man not guided by power or ambitions, freed from any corrupting torment, his only wish is to get back to his home near Trujillo. His moral 'cleanness' creates the perfect balance with a villain whose mind is clouded by hatred, Maximus seems 'one-dimensional' because we relate to him as a good father and a good son while we're more captivated by the back-story of Commodus. The Emperor's last line 'your faults as a son are my failure as a father' are the kind of lines Shakespeare might have been proud to write.There are elements of 'Julius Caesar' and 'Spartacus' but the resulting mix is unique and a standalone classic served by powerful performances, Connie Nielsen is the sister of Commodus and Maximus' previous mistress, and Oliver Reed makes his final performance as Proximo, the slave merchant and former gladiator who starts to respect Maximus as he realizes his value and encourages him to 'win the crowd' as the only way to earn his freedom. Maximus couldn't care much about freedom, his only wish is to avenge his family and join them in the afterlife, a secret he shares with his fellow slave, a Numidian played by Djimon Hounsou. The films covers many layers from spectacular entertainment to its arousing story and while not being totally accurate, it is engaging in every department and captures the essence of movies as an art of storytelling and spectacle, using special effects, even to recreate a heart-pounding fight with a tiger, something meant not to be noticed.And all the special effects of the world wouldn't have a point if we didn't care for the characters in the first place.The film is known for having been severely bashed by Roger Ebert himself, I read his review and I got some of his points about the fuzzy and muddy look, and yes, there might have a few abuse of the bluish American light, but there's a scene that can summarize my feeling. When Maximus is encouraged by the crowd to kill one of the gladiator, he's popular already, he earns the respect of the crowd but when he spares the fighter, there's a hesitation, some of the audience boos but it then turns into cheers again as he's called 'Maximus the Merciful'.When you win the crowd, whatever you do will look good, I guess whatever Scott did could pass, his film, along with the Best Picture Oscar of the year, had won the crowd as well, and deserves a special nod as one of the most defining and influential movies of the 2000's. Or well, let's just say 'I was entertained' to the point I didn't want to spot any visual flaw. That's how good it is.",9,1,1,30 April 2017
Donnie Darko," Complicated rather than complex, creepy rather than cryptic...
","'Donnie Darko' is so full of layers and interpretations (and it's so weird too) that I don't know by which end to take it. In fact, i would be a lie to say that I wasn't taken by its cryptic mood and the performance of Jake Gyllenhaal but another to tell you that I'm in a hurry to watch it again.First, it took me time not to turn my eyes away and accept the nightmare-inducing face of Harvey's ugly cousin Frank (did he have to be some damn creepy though? It was like having a recurrent close-up on 'The Shining''s bear-man).Also there's something rather disconcerting in that journey within Donnie's psyche, set in 1988 during the lapse of time between thee mysterious falling of a plane engine right in his room and the pre-announced end of the world, what makes the bridge between these two instances is interesting and Gyllenhaal delivers a great performance but a little less would have been a little more and the 'blame' goes to young writer/director Richard Kelly.The irony is that I'm not dismissing the film because I didn't get it, but because I did... or at least I think, but this is not a matter of getting the film than embracing its cryptic mood and creepy Lynchian psychological undertones. Because Kelly's film is a psychological thriller, but it's labeled as science fiction as well and this makes sense since the film uses many time-travel archetypes although the least famous bits, but I wish it could make a choice between Darko's mental illness and his 'mission', or at least find the right balance. And this comes from a time-travel buff.Indeed, 13 years before Nolan's 'Interstellar', Kelly explores the possibility of travelling through time by using portals between two tangent universes that don't interact but can let some remains or artefacts appear where (and when) they were not expected. If the right factors are combined, it is theoretically possible to go from a point A in a time t, to a point B in a time t minus something... and affect the time space continuum. Fair enough, so we have the travel, all we've got is to turn it into a mission and this is where Frank intervenes.The horrific giant bunny convinces Donnie to basically prevent the end of existence. How would Frank be trustworthy? Well, if it wasn't for him awakening Donnie at night when the engine fell in his room, Donnie would be dead. So, Frank isn't your usual imaginary friend, he's a blessing in his life only to reveal that the rest of the world is cursed. But how would Donnie, a high school kid, know what to do to prevent the cataclysm? In fact, the other clues are provided by his entourage, a school teacher played by Drew Barrymore who mention cellar doors, another teacher who gives a book about the 'philosophy of time travel', it's like everyone is either luring Frank into his final destination or maybe they're manipulated by the very instance that jeopardized the future of the world. Donnie is still the chosen one.It's interesting to see Gyllenhaal playing a kid with all the makings of an outcast and yet who's so immersed in his little suburban cocoon that in the span of a month, understands everything. I confess I read a few things that helped me to get the film (including some trivia about black holes) but the last time I saw the film, eleven years ago, I understood the basics and therefore I could really enjoy it the second time for what it was, an interesting, although not flawless movie about upper-middle class life and a kid who's more a malcontent than some begging-for-attention weirdo or like that 'American Beauty' voyeur. Gyllenhaal's acting (and Kelly's writing) combines the hidden anger with some subtle touches of sociability so that there's never a moment where Donnie crosses the line.For instance, je makes valid points in his Smurfette rant and his relationships with his sister (played by sister in life Maggie) is more a display of vitriolic sibling's complicity than any real hostility. Donnie is actually at his most hostile when he tells his sports teacher (Beth Grant) what to do with her theories about fear and love and when he unveils the real face of her love-guru played by the late Patrick Swayze. If not substantial, these subplots show that Donnie is far from the cliché of middle-child syndrome in some dysfunctional family, the mother (Mary McDonnell) is attentive and patient, the father (Holmes Osborn) often cracks up to his son's shenanigans and both parents trust the therapist played by Katharine Ross. Donnie even gets the luxury of a girlfriend (Jena Malone) and their interaction were so sweet and genuine that I wondered what if the film had chosen another path? What if Frank was a hallucination with another purpose? What if the awaited twist was something else?As soon as the mysterious wormholes appeared, all the true-to-life bits felts like decoys to cheap (though well executed) sensationalism. I feel guilty to criticize the film for the same reasons I enjoyed 'Mulholland Dr.' but Lynch had a whole different approach, he didn't make his film as accessible a Kelly who sins by showing and telling, and the film had a dreamy approach to its own theme, allowing us to penetrate the depths of their characters more than any needs or motives. Darko is as interesting as Naomi Watts in 'Drive' but he's engulfed in a story that turns him into a pawn and a martyr rather than an existential character. Did he really have a choice given that the end of the world means his own?The film is a celebrated cult-classic thanks to a terrific character and a terrific (terrifying too) story but I felt like both canceled each other, for a twist so ambitious it was underwhelming.",7,2,2,8 January 2020
Pocahontas," Full of colors but not colorful enough ...
","Only one year after 'The Lion King', that can be considered as the pinnacle of Disney Renaissance, was released the groundbreaking 'Toy Story', that would pave the way to a whole new generation of animated films. 1995 was the year of the 3D revolution, which -let's face it- didn't leave much room for 'the first animated Disney feature based on a true story'.I don't intend to be ironic, because on its own, 'Pocahontas' is a decent film with some solid animation but as much as I respect and appreciate the fact that the film tried to detach itself from Disney roots and deal with more adult and historically relevant material, I'm just sorry that it didn't succeed on the field of entertainment as it did on music and imagery. Something was missing and the movie did to me the same effect that an appetizing dish served in a beautiful plate but failing on the most crucial test. 'Pocahontaste' lacked the little extra spice, a pity when you consider how dazzling the cinematography was.I insist on the imagery because it contains such a great escapist value that if only for that, it's hard to maintain a negative opinion toward the film, 'Colors of the Wind' and the shot of Pocahontas rafting on the wild river is such a powerful image that it deserved a more interesting story to build around, especially since the film was intended to be a romance. But the romance proved again to be a tricky genre for Disney films as the least likely to entertain or to inspire empathy, unless it's saved by comic relief elements, scene-stealing sidekicks or memorable villains, which 'Pocahontas' didn't have. And go entertain a bunch of candy-eating kids in the movie theater with an Indian princess who falls in love with a British soldier, when one year before, it was about the coming-of-age story of a young lion who to become the king, and when a bunch of toys were living a great adventure.'Pocahontas' was meant to fail because of its own story, too historically loaded to introduce some fantasy elements and when it tried, it didn't go too far. When you make a tree speak through the soul of a deceased grand-mother, why not make the little animals speak for God's sake?! I have nothing against the raccoon and the hummingbird, but I'd be damned if they made me even smile once, their cuteness was on the same level of Disney's 1932 'Flowers and Trees' and whoever created them should have remembered that if a character doesn't add anything significant to the plot, at least, he must have some redeeming qualities, and 'being cute' isn't one.The secondary characters were so weak, that even the running gag involving the little rivalry between the raccoon and the dog didn't work for me, and although I watched the film only one year ago, I doubt that would have made me laugh either when I was 13, and certainly not as hard as Rafiki, Timon, Pumbaa or Genie, Abu or the magic carpet. And even if we give 'Pocahontas' the benefit of doubt and consider that many other Disney films featured forgettable sidekicks, I doubt they also had forgettable villains. And since the thrills and interest of the story is driven by the antagonist, 'Pocahontas' deserved more than a buffoon like Ratcliffe, not in the same league than Ursula, Jafar or the flamboyant Gaston.I hate to sound so technical, but there are some tacit rules established since the release of the first animated feature: every 'Snow White' needs her 'Seven Dwarfs' and 'Evil Queen', and they might even be more important. While the princess is the emotional core, a good Disney film is judged on its capability to scare and to make people laugh, and if it can work with bland and even dull heroines, it can't without strong supporting characters. Not all the Disney movies were romances of course, the others were generally quests or coming-of-age stories driven by young characters: Bambi, Pinocchio, Arthur or Mowgli whose identification was much easier, probably the key of 'The Lion King' and 'Toy Story''s appeal.'Pocahontas' had nothing special to impact the memories, and if it didn't sink into oblivion, it's probably a miracle due to the high quality of the film. But the story is just too mature: not enough fantasy, not enough colorful characters, it's even as if the writers were trapped by the content of their own stories, victim of this politically correct depiction of Natives, so angelic that the movie falls into a sort of reverse racism with the whole communion-with-Mother-nature stuff, so defining of the 90's and so hypocritical when you consider that the animators didn't embarrass themselves with depicting some Arabs in a stereotypical way in 'Aladdin', while they were more sensitive about the portrayal of Natives for obvious reasons.The result is a sort of animated 'Dances With the Wolves' so noble-spirited, so wise, that it's almost offensive not to love this film, when you take it from an adult point of view. But that's the problem because Disney films are precisely about awakening the inner child inside us, and while I'm writing this, I try to remember why I didn't want to watch the film when it was released, when I didn't know anything about the stuff I just wrote. And I just found out why: the movie that tries to be the least possibly offensive is still offensive, because with her geometrically drawn face, I never found Pocahontas pretty at all, and she was probably the least physically appealing of all the Disney princesses.And that, my friends, is so offensive in my opinion it canceled out all the good intentions...",7,0,1,12 December 2011
Born on the Fourth of July," Ron Kovic's arc or the soul of a torn apart America ...
","A young Ron Kovic is on his father's shoulders, and enjoys the 4th of July parade. Ronnie looks quite dull but he's got a beautiful girlfriend named Donna who offers him an original NY cap. It's Ronnie's birthday, his mother tells him with pride-irradiating eyes: 'You're my little Yankee Doodle boy'. During a night illuminated by the fireworks, Ron and Donna kiss, a privilege that small boys rarely get at 10, but it's Ronnie, Ronnie who makes his baseball team win and victoriously lifts his pumps in the air, so perfect it's unreal.There is yet a reason why the opening of 'Born on the Fourth of July' possesses this disorienting dream-like aspect, for it's too over-the-top from a director like Oliver Stone not to be deliberate. It starts like a fantasy because it's exactly into this that American values were turned after World War II, the idea that whatever America does is right, and any American boy should be proud to defend his country, to win, to be the best. It echoes General Patton's words: 'the very idea of losing is detestable for America'. Yet Patton fought in a war that, no matter how devastating it was, was necessary. The Vietnam War was not and now, it's a wound forever carved in America's heart, a stain in its soul, for which Oliver Stone's film works on a cathartic level.Fittingly 'Born on the 4th of July', Ron Kovic incarnates the spiritual destruction the Vietnam War applied on America's youth, before it turned into a generation-defining realization. That realization is the emotional core of the film and it's powerfully carried by Tom Cruise's performance. Cruise's good looks always played a significant part in his films because they helped to build a misleading feeling just to be contradicted by the evolution of his character ('Rain Man', 'Jerry Maguire'). 'Born on the Fourth of July' also features an extraordinary evolution, but in terms of acting, it transcends every other performance from Cruise. As Kovic, he personifies the patriotic enthusiasm of a youth that grew in a star-and-stripe clad cradle and its transformation into anger against the system that fooled them.And the higher Kovic went in the expression of his patriotism, the harder he fell. What is fascinating in Kovic is that he isn't necessarily perfect before the War; he loses at a wrestling game and sobs like a baby under the booing of a heartless crowd. Kovic is so 'Americanised' that losing a game is as upsetting as losing a war. So when the first recruitment's program for the Marine Corps comes to his school, he takes it as a chance to prove his value. Kovic loves his country and will serve it, even if he has to die. The 'trick' is that he didn't explore the eventuality of ending crippled and that's crucial: when a man lives, he's proud of having done his job, when he dies, he's not here to express any regrets, but on a wheelchair, it's another side of the show he's going to discover.The film's scope is so big that Stone rightfully keeps the essential from each episode of Kovic's life, especially since 'Platoon' was eloquent enough about the war. The fight scenes show that GI killed baby and civilians accidentally but so was it when they killed each other in battles far from the usual epic exaltations. Then, Kovic is shot and spends a long time in the veteran's hospital: one of the film's highlight, an invitation to discover the treatment, crippled soldiers received: the last rites (just in case), bathing in their own filth, incapable to clean themselves, sharing the place with rats. Kovic is told that he can't walk anymore, can't even have children; he endures a rough treatment to prevent amputation. But what he can't stand, more than pain, stink, rats or his disability is one carer's anti-war comment. His condition didn't earn him any respect or compassion, and the worst is yet to come.Returning at home, Kovic realizes that life has changed, hippies give him the finger; the American flag is burned instead of being proudly raised in the air. 'Love it or leave it!' still shouts Kovic in denial. The attitude spread to his Family, his own brother doesn't believe in the war, and the trip to self-awareness doesn't end here. Wherever he goes, Kovic is confronted to disrespect and carelessness, a friend who didn't believe in the War, is doing well in fast-food business, a WWII veteran reminds him he's got no reason to be angry about, he fought, he lost, and gives him the ultimate insult by calling him a traitor. The anger's burning in Kovic's heart reaches its heart-breaking pinnacle when he wakes up his whole family, submerged by his drunkenness, he -for the first time- understands that this war destroyed him, for nothing, because the very America he fought for, is now acting like an ungrateful bitch.But the courage of Kovic is not to stand alone in his own blindness. During a trip in a Mexican whorehouse where he encounters veterans living in the same condition, he's left alone with a vet played by Willem Dafoe in the desert, they fight, insult, spit on each other, but it's probably the last step before self-awareness. Symbolizing through his character's arc a real revolution in America's society, Kovic becomes the spokesperson of a whole generation against the war. Not because one shouldn't fight for his country, but because there were no values noble enough to fight in Vietnam, to destroy America's spirit, no matter how supposedly 'evil' Communism was, America was no better in that war. Kovic said that who fought there, and Oliver Stone showed that, who fought there, too. Intelligent, thought provoking and uncompromising, 'Born of the Fourth of July' is one of the most important American films, and one of the best of the 80's.",10,1,2,30 October 2012
The Social Network," You don't get to the greatest idea of the century, without having a great film made of it ...
","After his disappointing 'Benjamin Button', Fincher handles another subject, no less risky ... Indeed, I thought a movie dealing with algorithms and a courtroom case would be anything but entertaining ... how wrong I was!The film actually depressed me  because THE idea of the century has already been done. There won't be any other great and creative idea for about 50 years, and the guy who got it, is from my generation  hell, I'm even older than him. Sorry for that burst of ego, but I guess the purpose of a review is to be sincere  Intelligence? Creativity? Luck? Maybe all these factors combined can fulfill a vision, but not one worth billions of dollars, I don't believe in that. Mark Zuckenberg, played by a remarkable actor with a rhyming name, Jesse Eisenberg, was a genius, and his paternity of Facebook is undeniable. As he dryly shouts to the Winklevoss twins, played by the two, no wait, the one Arnie Hammer: 'If you guys were the inventors of Facebook, you'd have invented Facebook' Implacably and impeccably logical. Mark is not just the hero of the film, he's MY hero, and whether I approve the concept of Facebook or not, is pointless. He's got a successful idea, that changed the face of the world, more than ever. He won, and I applaud.Now, why did I use the word genius? Because it takes a three-dimensional intelligence to have such an idea. Mark felt an even greater potential in Internet, not exploited yet. Internet was the key. He knew people loved social networking, they needed to exist, to be somebodies. Internet puts you in a map, literally. 'I click therefore I exist' this is the Cogito of the 2000's. Mark got that. That's from the past, from the present, he understood the natural tendencies we all have to reach popularity. 'Existence precedes popularity' Popularity as the modern essence of human beings, this is the existentialism of the 2000's. Finally, he knew, that in the future, users will want to know about stuff happening to people they know, with an almost voyeuristic approach. There's no real philosophy to describe this, but this is what Mark predicted. We'll never know if someone would have come with the same idea  well, maybe the Winklevoss twins, but they were destined to inspire Mark, with the Harvard network idea The twins were number two, translation: nothing.Past, present, future combined in one hell of a visionary concept named 'The Facebook', Mark's friend, Eduardo (Andrew Garfield) financed it, and the creator of Napster, Sean Parker, Justin Timberlake in a scene-stealing performance, was the mentor, the adviser, whose greatest contribution was to suggest to remove the 'the'. The rest is a whole success story told in flashback from the hearings opposing Mark, the twins, and Eduardo, whom he personally fired through an unfriendly move. Nothing personal, strictly business. The movie is not here to judge Mark. The tag-line summarizes it best, anyway: 'You don't get to 500 millions friends without making a few enemies', probably the most memorable tag-line of 2010, so iconic it's the only one to be featured in the poster in such big characters.It's all about self-confidence and capability to take painful decisions. Mark is irreverent, eccentric but he does have one quality: he respects people on the basis of their own accomplishments. He mocks the courtroom because no one is capable to produce something in the same vein than Facebook, but he respects Sean Parker for what he created. Tell me what you did, and I will respect you, or at least have the humility not to judge me. This notion of respect is crucial because this is what will drive his creative process, the ability to listen, and to translate any idea into a concept. When a wimpy student comes to ask him if one girl is single or not, Mark realizes that 'Facebook' concept is so big, it's like a goldmine for new ideas and improvements. It's such a great success story that he even learns from case that failed, or worse, that succeeded after the creator sold the rights, like the 'Victoria Secret' story.This film proves how ruthless is today's world, how we can make it big if we think big. We're indeed in an animal farm, with insects, sheep, and outside, foxes, predators. Some people just want to be successful businessmen, some other just to live, others to be accepted. Some use their strength, others their brains, and other their looks, like girls, or chicks whose sexist portrayal didn't bother me  I studied in a campus, in the same time as Mark, a big business school with hot girls and guys so sinister they were already masturbating over working in some big companies, and I know they got now the girls they fantasized about, but they're still obedient agents of a system that prefer to handle sheep rather than foxes. I had enough intelligence to understand this modern Social Darwinism, like many other free-spirited nobodies, but Mark had the idea AND the competence.Yes, Mark got the point, but again, it wasn't enough, please stop with all that 'luck' bullshit. I'm not a genius, I'm not Mark, but I know that I'm no computer pro, so even if I had the chance to think of the concept, I wouldn't have enough knowledge to apply what I wanted. Would I get the Nobel Prize of Medicine just because I thought it would be cool to find a cure for AIDS? Mark was practical, pragmatic, and had enough intelligence to build a strong competence in Internet. It might be a drama for some, a biopic, for me it's a great story driven by a creative script, and a true inspiration ...",10,1,5,7 May 2011
The Pursuit of Happyness," The 'Gardner' who took care of his garden...
","...not like Voltaire's Candide but like a man with enough wisdom to know that you never get nothing with nothing, and enough candor to believe that everything is possible if you put your determination into it. Sounds corny? Not really.You know a film has hit the right chord when at the ultimate moment, your brain is flooded by a triumphing sentiment of sheer satisfaction and you're not just empathetic toward the hero, but almost telepathic. When Chris Gardner, Will Smith in his most spectacular role, learns that he's hired by the stock broker company he's been dreaming of ever since a smiling Porsche driver told him it was his job; at that moment, I could pinpoint every single thought that went through his mind, I could literally taste the tears. Any lesser film, going for cheap sentiments, would have made this an average feel-good crowd-pleaser but Smith's humility and the way he manages to channel every emotion through his eyes was simply mind-blowing. I didn't expect I would connect to a character so rapidly and intensely and it happened to me back to back this week, with 'The Pursuit of Happyness', and before, 'Sideways'.Now, it's easy and convenient to label Gabriele Mucino's film as an average rags to riches story, Chris Gardner has become a guru for wannabe successful people. But this would be doing a great disservice to the lesson his life provides by reducing it to the fact that he became rich after being so poor, the soul of his victory lies in his struggle. What made him a rich man is the same spirit that was driving him when he was miserable and while I followed his bad streak all through the film-to call him unlucky is the understatement of the year- I was convinced that the guy had the right stuff, as a father, as a man. And in a time where Hollywood movies are full of stories with brutal fathers, what a change to have a good, decent, honest, hard-working, humble man who takes care of his son at the same moment where it's the mother who throws the towel. Thandie Newton gives a remarkable performance in the film's more ungrateful role, being selfish for lack of patience and irresponsible for lack of strength, she's her first victim.The mother's character is even more interesting because it mirrors our own mentalities; some accuse the millennials to feel entitled and as a man approaching his forties, I guess I wouldn't have made the same decisions than Chris, if I had to go through an internship without being paid, I might have knocked to another door (and somewhat I did refuse tempting internships for better paying ones but in industries I didn't care of)... if I missed an important meeting, I might have blamed bad luck, but Chris seizes all the opportunities and never lets anything work as an obstacle. Watching the film, I tried to memorize which moments where the most pivotal and you could narrow them down to four or five, Chris giving the money to the CEO, while he needed it to have a roof for the day, an apology for the missed meeting, a cab ride where he could demonstrate his skill at the Rubik cube and get the interview, and finally, having the right punchline during that same interview when asked why they should hire a man coming with jeans and all soaked with white paint.Chris' determination is a rollercoaster but the film never falls in the trap of sanctification, it's all dealt with rationality. Chris' efforts are due to his fatherless childhood, he must always be present for his son Christopher (Jaden Smith), whatever he does is for his son. He needs money so badly for a roof that he learns how to save money, how to be efficient at his job to get out before the others, how to respect timing, when he gives the money to the CEO, his teary eyes for such a small gesture gives you an idea of how precious money is and somewhat it's that state of sheer poverty that also consolidated his moral strength. It was a matter of survival and Chris fulfilled the seminal role of a father, which is to be both benevolent, protective, disciplining with his child, and ensuring a sane link between the family and the external world. Chris can also be severe with his son, and as the story goes, his easy going nature fades when he's confronted to overwhelming obstacles.But somewhat, since we know the outcome, we're not surprised, the determination is almost foreseen with the X-ray machine running gag, that big medical 'gizmo' he must sell to earn a few weeks of living is a real hot potato that is almost unsellable, until it becomes a matter of life and death when he has no income, the more difficult it gets, the more precious these objects are, and being stolen one is something he can't afford and if one doesn't work, well he must fight the way to make it work. As he said in the interview, he might not have the answer but he has what it takes to find it and he's convincing.Many people would have dismissed one tenth of what he went through his life, thinking they 'deserve better' while Chris certainly deserved more than anyone to succeed only he faced the adversity and the fog of crap he went through, he triumphed with peril and his story doesn't glorify him but his perseverance, it's not about believing in your dreams because Chris didn't know he was going to be rich, but it's about being decent, and responsible and going till the end, Chris has many breakdowns but he never gives up, he's a class A father and as a struggling father myself, I think I just found myself an inspiration.",8,0,0,13 September 2019
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," The Father, the Son and the Holy Grail...
","The third installment of the 'Indiana Jones' series is another epic ride through human civilization's most ominous mysteries, especially one that awaited for centuries a modern scholar with the intrepidity of a knight, to unveil its treasure. 'The Last Crusade' deserves such a religious title because religion and esotericism have always been part of Indiana Jones' quests, though he insists that facts are what matter the most, you can count on Spielberg and Lucas to mix up these almighty facts with the most thwarting oddities.'Temple of Doom' was perhaps the most outrageously over-the-top while depicting the heights of barbarity reached by mysticism, but I liked it for these specific reasons, it was like Spielberg wanted to push his character even further than in the first film, getting rid of conventional enemies like Nazis and putting him in such a hostile territory never would a theater's seat feel so comfortable and cozy. I suspect 'Temple of Doom' wouldn't have been as successful had it stuck to the original format, and I suspect 'Crusade' wouldn't have been successful if 'Doom' wasn't made that way, because its the kinship with the first film (proving that Spielberg and Lucas heard their detractors) that provided the premise of a back-to-roots Indy, with more fun and outdoor escapades than these dark arenas where hearts were removed and monkey brains eaten.This is why 'Crusade' didn't exactly excite me like the first or the second, it had too many déjà- vu inducing moments and the quest for the Holy Grail, while beautifully set-up and supported by convincing historical data, had too much resemblance with the 'Ark Covenant' MacGuffin. It was obvious we were being served a different meal with the same ingredients though less spicy than the second opus. But the film took five years to be made, and Spielberg and Lucas checked many scripts before finally picking the 'Crusade' one, they didn't make any sequel, they knew they add to inject some novelty. Had they kept the sidekicks, Sallah (John Rhys-Davies), Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliott), the Nazis and the supernatural quest, the film would have been a pale copy of 'Raiders', but back then, there was a movie veteran who knew how to steal scenes and give them a fresh air. He had just done it with 'The Untouchables' and he was doing it again with 'Crusade'. As Henry Jones Sr., Sean Connery plays the iconic adventurer's father, he's like a Victorian straitlaced teacher, who cannot have the name of God said in vain, who can slap his boy and call him 'Junior', and the best thing about it, is that Indy doesn't rebel.It takes forever to get them together but when Ford and Connery appear on the screen, the chemistry is immediate because Ford has this particular ability to play heroes without really feeling like a hero, he's just a guy who does his job, trying to overcome the obstacles one by one, but his father, is one figure he can't overcome. He makes his father feels like one, and in one facial expression, the cool hero becomes Daddy's boy. Jones Sr. reveals new dimensions in Indy himself, as a boy who's been transmitted the passion for science, history and discipline, and this contrasts so well with his easygoing nature that we feel like the best discovery about the film isn't the Grail, but Indy.So, despite my previous criticism, I consider this film as triumphant as the others because it did exactly what we expect from sequels, going back to the roots, the film opens with a fine opening sequence, with the late River Phoenix playing young Indy, he takes a cross stolen by grave robbers, and over the course of a thrilling chase on a speeding train, we discover the origin of Indy's scar in the chin, his scare of snakes, his legendary fedora, his father being one of these sacred figures he can't conquer and last but not least, that over the course of science, some things are worth being abandoned because there is more to learn in the intangible.It does feel corny but trust Spielberg and Lucas, they know where the action is leading. They provide great sequences that have nothing to envy from the first ones, from the catacombs of Venice to the Middle-East Desert, aboard a speedboat, a zeppelin, a plane or a tank, the two men fight with their skills and weapons and Henry Jones Jr. has a few shining moments while remaining true to his character. Connery didn't want to play a kind of goofy and mad scientist, but more of a respectable figure who'd be responsible for Jones Jr.' being. And we finally get it at the climactic moment where for the first time, he calls his son by his first name, and Ford's reaction is the film's emotional reward. I take any conventional action sequence if it leads us to this.So, this is what I take from the film, the magnificent bond between the Joneses, and the casting of Sean Connery, although slightly older than Ford, was the best possible homage to the own adventurer he played in his youth, the iconic James Bond. Ford was no newcomer in 1989, but there's a great torch-passing vibe in the film that makes it all worth to watch. Indy might not have taken a trophy with him but he discovered more in this adventure than all the previous ones. It's a sort of coming-of-age story with clearly Lucas' stamp here, unless I'm reading too much by seeing some Luke and Anakin Skywalker's vibes between the two., or am I just having fun mixing two cinematic myths, concocted by two great filmmakers, two big boys who never forgot that we all are someone's little boy or girl. Maybe it's in this film, that we can understand the secret of Spielberg and Lucas' appeal",8,0,0,10 October 2016
Back to the Future," Back to the 50's ... Back to the 80's ... Back to a Timeless Classic ...
","With a gentleness delicately lying beneath a smart and intelligent script, contributing to this extraordinary appeal that transcends every age barriers, 'Back to the Future', in the same vein than its glorious predecessor 'It's a Wonderful Life', is one of these heart-warming masterpieces that definitely stood the test  of time.There is Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd's improbably pairing as Marty McFly and Doc Emmett Brown, the cool 80's teenager and the mad scientist, yet the chemistry is here, and we believe that these guys can be great friends. There is this unforgettable sight of the De Lorean at 88 mph disintegrating in a flash of light, leaving the two unforgettable fire trails. There is this heart-pounding climax on the clock tower driven by Alan Silvestri exhilarating 80's-defining score. There is this heart in the story. As the pillar of the movie's greatness there is Bob Gale and Zemeckis' winner script.'Back to the Future' deserves its reputation as one of the most quotable films ever and with the richest gallery of colorful characters each one impacting our memories with so many delirious catchphrases, from Biff Tannen's 'Butthead' to Marty's 'This is heavy' and of course, Doc's hysterical '1,21 Gigawatts!' or 'Great Scott'. Christopher Lloyd has this unique talent to revive the mad scientist figure with a likable dimension, creating one of the most eccentric and sympathetic characters from the flamboyant 80's. But the power of the script doesn't just rely on its 'destiny' in one-liners, but in the way it rigorously respects the codes of every genre with a new remarkable technical precision.'Back to the Future' is a masterstroke of originality in the way it adapted the 'adventure' genre, where the exoticness of the setting doesn't rely on its geographical but chronological aspect. Marty lives in a weird world where people don't know what a Pepsi Free or who John Kennedy are, and where Ronald Reagan is still 'the actor?!'. The adventure aspect provides some of the best gags of the film. Now to the Sci-Fi, from the simple premise of the film: time travels, Zemeckis refreshed an old scientific speculation by introducing the notion of ripple effect, that the smallest change in the past can have significant consequences for the future, for the better or for the worse. Finally, a movie had the right approach to time travels, probably earning it a deserving place in AFI's Top 10 Sci-Fi films.This scientific approach conditioned Marty's mission in 1955, by preventing his parents from meeting and falling in love, Marty unknowingly jeopardized his own existence and of his siblings. The script outsmarts us through its ability to convert one thousands words into one simple image, Marty's picture with his brother and sister and the progressive fading of their bodies, cleverly illustrates Doc's notion of ripple effect. No need of words, the picture is the materialization of the success or the failure of the mission. And as long as Lorraine (Lea Thompson), is in love with her future son, the existence of her future children with George is severely compromised.What a tricky dilemma! And when you discover Marty's family in 1985, you wonder how such a loser as George McFly (Crispin Glover) could have had a woman anyways. And Marty made the thing impossible again by replacing his own father on his to-be mother's heart. And Lorraine, by falling in love with her own son, creates a whole oedipal situation that, beyond the laughs, offers a very interesting perspective on the perception we might have toward our parent's youth, as we finally realize that they were young once. Of course, no one would dare to question how he would react if his own mother fell in love with him, but the way this is handled in the film is tactful and never fall into caricature.This is the very aspect that makes 'Back to the Future' a Family Comedy, with a heart beating for every generation, a film you can enjoy with your parents your buddies or your kids whether it's from the 50's or the 80's nostalgic value. Most of the film's humor relies on the 'generation gap' factor and the way things have changed a lot or not so much. Compare Lorraine's advice to her kids in 1985 and the way she behaved thirty year earlier. See poor Uncle Joey who might get used to his bars as a baby, Biff Tannen's same stupid jokes etc. The film cleverly underlines the effect time can have on our perceptions and relationships with people. But the beauty of 'Back to the Future' is that the heart of the Family story and the entertainment from the laughs combined with the speculative imagination of Sci-Fi contribute to a new inspirational dimension.Time travels represent the final opportunity to domesticate time, and to get a second chance. George gets a second chance and Marty learns one lesson or two during his journey while applying the fatherly advice he gave to his own father. And even more powerful is the way George would ultimately be the one to win Lorraine's heart and not through Marty's intervention, proving that sometimes, a simple act of bravura can change all your life for the best. Similarly to 'It's a Wonderful Life', the film is about getting a second chance, about life, about time passing  And I can't go on without mentioning the most extraordinary moment of the film that would eternally ring bells of joy in my heart when George finally kisses Lorraine and in all of sudden, Marty who was progressively fading gets up and sees his brother and sister finally reappear in the photo. Mission accomplished! And two young people dancing, ignoring, but we do, that they'll be forever together. An extraordinary moment that for me, summarizes the cherished place this film will occupy in my heart, for a long ... time.",10,1,1,3 October 2011
Goodfellas," The Quintessential 'Gangster' film ...
","'Goodfellas' is so realistic you feel like watching a documentary about the mob: the narration is straight-forward, it doesn't try to use big words, or a rich vocabulary, gangsters proudly talk like the lucky scumbags they are. As for the others, the honest guys, like you and me, they are simply labeled as losers, how could someone like a script where he's almost insulted? Well, just think about this, insulted by whom? by a wannabe big shot who thinks he's the king of the world simply because he doesn't need to stand in a queue, or can get the best table to his girlfriend in the restaurant? the genius of the script is that you're almost envying the protagonists in the beginning, the whole first act has a sort of joyful atmosphere where everything is fun, even when it's not. It almost makes you drool about this life where everything is easy: money, girls, sex, fun, power, respect, when you, poor schmuck, has to struggle to live a crappier life ...But they ARE criminals, no doubt about that, they're cheaters, they're robbers, murderers, they cheat their wives, they stab in the back, and the only honor they have is not to 'rat on your friends', as if there were friends in this business anyway ... even the rules are corrupted from the beginning, why shouldn't you rat? if you're put in a position where you might do it, you're already a target ... it's a nasty, stinking, horrific world, we're proud not to belong to at the end of the film, and that's the power of the script. You follow these characters who seem cool, nice, funny (like a clown, or just like that) and you end up feeling guilty for that. The movie makes you question this weird appeal you feel to gangsters, even one of the first lines of the movie is quite significant : 'As far back as I can remember, I've always wanted to be a gangster' ... we're like, wow! This movie goes ahead, it shouts loudly what 'The Godfather' was trying to whisper ... from the first words of the 'Wags to Riches' song, we're literally plunged into a world, where we share the dreams of a character who wants to be a gangster, as if it was the most honorable profession. The movie doesn't even question that, it's almost normal to want to be a gangster. Scorsese has a twisted provocative approach in the beginning of the movie and it works perfectly, because it makes the ending all the more bittersweet, or all the more ironic.Which takes me to the last lines, compare them with the first. The character's story arc concludes with these powerful lines : 'I'm an average nobody... get to live the rest of my life like a schnook', this line is like a last slap in the face to the other schmucks who didn't realize during the movie that these guys were ALL already average nobodies, and probably worse than that, even when everything was fine ... the last grin on Hill's face after he did it 'his way' (a reference to the ending credits song) is to highlight the ridiculousness of the situation where he's trying to persuade himself he ever was someone before, but he was nothing ... he didn't exist in the papers, he didn't exist in society, he did nothing, and the only wise decision he took was to save his skin by 'ratting' on his 'friends'. This is a movie about ultimate losers, about a cruel, violent and nasty world where sooner or later, you LOSE. But you don't lose because crime does not pay, let's not be that naive. You lose because this so-called fellowship is based on a fallacious etiquette that makes friendship and loyalty totally inconceivable, at least in the long term. Consequently, when you watch the movie a second time, you realize that everything is fake from the beginning, the ending makes the irony even more palpable ... hell, the irony is even in the title, 'Goodfellas' ...Just like its glorious predecessor, 'The Godfather', the script is one of the most remarkable elements of the films, especially when combined with an incredible editing : you jump from a memorable scene to another, you're like watching a time capsule of the criminal world, it's an entertaining journey into crime that doesn't show how crime is fun or entertaining, but just to highlight in a more powerful way the cruelty of this world that looked so joyful, so cool in the beginning (and I don't even mention the acting)... In other words, the script is provocative, ironic and entertaining, what do you want more? better written dialogs? that's not the point. 'City Lights' didn't need dialogs to be considered a masterpiece, nor does 'Goodfellas' where the vocabulary is so particular, it's like another character from the film.'Goodfellas', Marty's masterpiece is the quintessential Gangster film, not because it makes you want to be a gangster, but because it gives you two feelings in common with gangsters, envy and fear ... and a third one at the end, which is guilt.",10,2,5,22 December 2010
The Bourne Supremacy," The 'Bourne' Density...
","Well, it didn't take long for Doug Liman to pass the torch to Paul Greengrass and adapt Robert Ludlum's second chapter of Jason Bourne's adventures titled 'Supremacy' and released in 2004. Speaking rugby jargon, 'Identity' scored the goal, 'Supremacy' made the two-point conversion.Indeed, 'The Bourne Supremacy' is exactly what you expect from a follow-up to a promising spy thriller, it features the same amount of fights, chases, ambushes, killings and exotic locations (taking us from Gao, India to Moscow, Russia with a few shortcuts through NYC) and it provides more density to the pre-existing characters, more gravity to Bourne's existential troubles and a nice addition with Joan Allen. As Pamela Landy, she plays a CIA officer investigating the many loose ends of the 'Treadstone' operation, the mysterious murder of a highly influent Russian and his wife. Both ways lead to Bourne and makes him the target of another cat-and-mouse game where Bourne is the mouse first and becomes the cat after, then a lynx near the end.There are two interesting things about Bourne, first it's the paradoxical nature of the character, making him a little more fascinating than James Bond whose timelessness made him predictable no matter how cool and confident he was, and hard to inspire a real emotional bond (no pun intended). However, Bourne is a man whose dissociative amnesia obstructed many memories from his past as a professional killer, which means the more he wants to know about him, the less he does but the more he tries to hide himself, the more of a target he becomes. There's something inevitable about the confrontations that occupies the final act, whether with the one character who reveals his true villainy, Landy, Julia Stiles as Nicky and finally, a girl who might not recognize him as the man who simply killed his parents.In a way, Bourne is a hero within the context of the film but with the background that has evil all printed on it and that's the trick with this character, his curse is perhaps his blessing. Still, he must face the game and plays with it as a sort of cathartic redemption. That's how he indulges to emotional breakdowns at times and loses his cool, while still being cool. The other blessing is that the amnesia didn't cancel off his skills and he's still capable to fool the enemy and lure them into his own plans. There's a great scene where he uses himself as a bait for an arrest because he knows that's how he will be spotted. The film might be labeled as an action film, which it is, but if you follow it closely, and close your eyes on one or two contrivances and some redundancy in the action department, you'll get yourself hooked by the stories and the many ramifications with previous backstories.To say that the film is a character study would be a stretch though: Bourne has a few quiet drama scenes, but he's a man of action, in a constant alert situation, spotting either the danger or the opportunity to get his enemies using not only his force but his brains (the way he outsmarts the big villain is unexpected and original). It's through his actions that we know a little more about Bourne, the film provides many information but they're never used as expositional samples. That said, one viewing might make the film look too complex and mazy and some flashbacks are shown like flashes of memories punctuated with blackouts, betraying some directorial teasing stuff. But it's not overdone (thankfully) and the presence of Matt Damon enhances the film, and so does the gallery of supporting characters with a honorable mention to Brian Cox. His interactions with Allen are top-caliber acting.And I will say what I said about the first, once again, it's about people who don't enjoy what they do: even the villain who comes the closest to kill Bourne is an average man who's paid for that and doesn't have the little edgy smirk or the flamboyance of a Bond villain. 'The Bourne Supremacy' has this thing in common with its predecessor, it's straightout drama, it doesn't go for fancy catchphrases and one-liners and while it might seem sometimes too serious à la Nolan, it provides a nice feeling of continuity in tone and style. And at the risk of repeating myself, the film has no pretension to duplicate a James Bond formula but what it does (and does well) is establishing the birth of an iconic franchise, with solid entertainment and characterization and not much of melodrama, if we except the sad exit of Marie (Frannka Potente) and the last scene that seems a bit exaggerated but rewarded by the final phone-call between Landy and Bourne, and an interesting twist that I suspect might be the film's cliffhanger.The film can be watched right after the first and right now, I'm eager to watch the third opus. And if 'Idenity' was a well-made thriller with a promising character, let's conclude by saying that 'Supremacy' is a well-made sequel with a character that gains more density as we follow his quest to know who he was, in order to be someone else, and someone better. Yes, he might have a troubled past, but he's got the right stuff. In other words, if Bond is a cool guy, Bourne is a good guy.",8,1,2,12 March 2020
Shark Tale," It was the Oscar for 'Finding Nemo', and Finding Money for Oscar...
","Whatever the differences between Disney's Pixar and DreamWorks Studios are in terms of animation and types of stories, I don't think they have been more opposite as when they were fully expressed by the two rival studios when they coincidentally decided to handle the aquatic world, in a one-year interval: 'Finding Nemo' in 2003 and 'Shark Tale' in 2004. If it is a coincidence or a case of some 'leaks' (no pun intended) doesn't really matter as the two films don't navigate in the same seas. Starting with Disney, 'Finding Nemo' was a charming and heart-warming tale about a father fish looking for his missing (and titular) son, while the son was trying to escape from a fish tank. The story featured some of the most dazzling images ever created by Disney Studios, with the same hypnotic beauty as 'The Little Mermaid' and a story that emotionally resonated like Disney's old-school movies, such as 'Dumbo' or 'Bambi'. For a film made In 2003, to be listed in the American Film Institute's Top 10 Animated movies proved the impression the movie left among the professionals.On the other hand, DreamWorks has always been about very flawed and loose characters engaged into story lines that worked more as vehicles for countless pop- culture references, remember the 'Shrek vs. Robin Hood' fight with the whole River Dance and the 'Matrix' parody, or the fairy tale creatures featured in very modern situation? Well, the counterpart of 'Finding Nemo', titled 'Shark Tale' isn't much a story set in the Ocean than all the narrative fragments of other classics reassembled to form a seemingly story. It doesn't strike for its originality ('Shrek' made the AFI's Top 10, not this one) but the creators seem to have built the fun on our recognition of the many movies or pop-cultures elements they refer to.Indeed, there is no situation that is not archetypal, no character-type you haven't seen before. In fact, even the characters look exactly like the actors voicing them. So, if you don't have Scorsese's voice in mind, (which would be surprising) you might recognize his fishy alter-ego from his huge bushy eyebrows just like De Niro's shark has a mole, and Jolie's fish huge sensual lips. That's it, it's déjà vu from beginning to end, even the title is a take on De Niro's father-and-son movie 'A Bronx Tale'. But guess what? the story works nonetheless and this is why I'm surprised by Roger Ebert's review, or personal take on the film.The late critic, who could be wrong but not very often, deplored that 'Shark Tale' with all its references to classics like 'The Godfather', 'Goodfellas', 'Scarface' and of course 'Jaws' (the inevitable one, even parodied in 'Nemo' and that grabbed the earlier laughs in that one), there's nothing left for the usual universal and simpler material that can appeal to children. And he's right. I'm pretty sure that if I was 10 when I saw 'Shark Tale', I wouldn't have gotten most of the references, and I would have probably enjoyed like I enjoyed 'Fish Police'. However, I was 22 when the film was released, so I guess I was in the right demographic target.Indeed, my cinematic education, if not complete, was mature enough to get most of the jokes, to instantly recognize De Niro behind Don Lino's mimics and having 'The Godfather' as my all-time favorite increased the enjoyment. Gee, I was even a fan of 'Car Wash' at that time so I didn't miss any reference. And how could I? 'Shark Tale' is one pop-culture reference after another, it almost becomes a gimmick. And I understand that for some viewers, it might get tiresome, once you have played the spot-the-star game and managed to guess Jack Black or Renee Zelwegger; you want the story to grab you a little, and it does, sort of.There are basically two plots: Oscar, a whale washer, is a nobody trying to be somebody with a sort of end-justifying-the-means way, ignoring the cute assistant in love with him, and there is Lenny, the vegetarian shark who disappoints his Godfather- like father, Don Lino. The two plots get intertwined with a share of unevenly predictable twists, but let's not kid ourselves, the whole story is rather predictable, countless mafia parodies have been made, including 'Analyze This' a few years before, but the script overcomes the predictable stuff by providing some nice one- liners and funny moments, and such lousy puns they miraculously work.The whole thing leads to the kind of conclusion that comforts that this was not a film to take seriously in the first place, it's meant to be fun. Now, to get back to Ebert's comment, yes, he's right that the film doesn't find the right touch to appeal children, and on that level, it would be an average film. But once you get the idea that this is not a film for kids, but for adults young adults or adults adults, its quality suddenly improves. It's all a matter of angle.And at least, it didn't try to emulate 'Finding Nemo', and had instead a sleazier 'Finding Money' story line (and I'm sorry for the lousiness of this pun).",7,1,1,8 June 2016
The Birds," No time for 'Why?' and no time for 'How?' ... only for 'Wow!' ...
","Probably Hitchcock's last film to be so deeply rooted in the cultural unconscious, 'The Birds' is as traumatically heart-pounding as it was five decades ago, and I even defy the CGI-nourished eyes of the current generation not to be thrilled by this masterpiece of horror.'The Birds' is one of my favorite films from Hitch for one simple reason; it's straight-forwardly horrific. It's one of the rare occurrences where the Master decides not to embarrass himself with subtleties and innuendos and go directly to the core, which is about a peaceful little town in a California bay, victim of incessant attacks from seagulls, crows, sparrows. Of course, these attacks started with a pivotal event, a newcomer, Melanie Daniels, incarnated by the beautiful Tippi Hedren, coming from San Francisco to meet a potential boyfriend, the hunky Mitch, played by Rod Taylor. During a boat ride, she's savagely attacked by a gull, a sudden event that foreshadows the beginning of a nightmarish journey where the attacks will increase, getting more and more cruel, and coming from all kinds of birds. As a true nightmare, there is no proper answer to all the 'why's' and 'how's', just a level of nasty viciousness getting more and more disturbing and depriving the film from the sensuality we expect from a Hitch film.Speaking of sensuality, I'm perfectly aware that the aficionados of the Hitchockian oeuvre would spend hours to identify and analyze all the sexual or sensual aspects of the film, its predominance of women and the significant part they play, from Suzan Pleshette to Jessica Tandy who plays Mitch's skeptical mother, but I have the intimate conviction that Hitchcock wanted to make, though 'The Birds' a film that would make people jump off their seat, and the cardiac rhythm to increase rather than the brainy mechanisms to work. This is not an intellectual film, and the romance only works as a starter and never does it serve the film, mostly driven by a heart-pounding urgency. It's a sensational masterpiece of terror in the purest tradition of the genre, with an undeniable entertaining value, illustrating Hitchcock's quote: 'The length of a film should be directly related to the endurance of the human bladder.' 'The Birds' is popular now because it was 'popular' back then.What makes me so sure that it wasn't intended to be deeper than that? Well, consider all the movies made about attacks from group of evil creatures, or monsters. There are three categories of villains: those who come from a reason and are defeated at the end, like the shark from 'Jaws', those who comes from nowhere but are eventually defeated at the end, like the zombies from 'The Night of the Living Dead' and those who come from a reason and are not necessarily defeated at the end, leaving a cloud of ambiguity. In the case of 'Birds', not only do the attacks seem purely arbitrary, yet the movie ends with one unforgettable interrogation mark, keeping a great mystery for the reasons of their attacks and the way to defeat them. Many essays traced an interesting parallel between the attacks of the girls and the relationship that involves the male character with the women of his life, applying a sort of sexual innuendo in the bird's attack. As much as I was fascinated by these readings, I must admit that it's nothing compared to the film as a visual experience.Hitchcock said it himself: 'If it's a good movie, the sound could go off and the audience would still have a perfectly clear idea of what was going on.' From that basis, 'The Birds' is his greatest film because the level of horror is transcended by outstanding visual effects and quite groundbreaking for their time.Who can't be left with a sheer terror when witnessing the scene where the birds ruins a little girl's birthday or attack a group of running and screaming children, when we discover a store owner with plucked eyes, a gutsy shot that probably had the same effect than the decapitated head in 'Jaws'. Indeed, birds as ruthless and democratic in their targets as the shark from 'Jaws', they attack children, women, old people as to sustain the idea of a truly apocalyptic universe where everyone's life is threatened, and the feeling is even scarier because since we don't know where this comes from, we don't know how to end it. If the special effects were mature for their ages, how about the fact that Hitchcock didn't let the birds be defeated. It's such a pervert yet delightful move that couldn't have been more powerful,in the iconic last shot where a literally sea of birds occupy the house and we feel that at any moments, the protagonists would 'get it', nothing happens but we still endure one of the most suspenseful moments in cinema's history.The attacks where about horror, and terror, but the last scene is all about suspense, because you just don't know if the bomb will explode or not and if it does when, and you can only breath when 'The End' appears, but we're still not sure about the character's fate. Anyone who wants to make a horror thriller should watch 'The Birds' because it's landmark for the genre that elevates violence to a level never reached before the 'New Hollywood' wave. Proof that Hitchcock was never an old-school director and remained one of the most influential, and one of the few privileged one, along with Fellini and Bergman, who inspired an adjective.'The Birds' is a Hitchcockian masterpiece.",9,2,4,8 February 2012
Sully," Likable film about an admirable man, but the material was better suited for a documentary...
","'On January 15, 2009. More than 1.200 first responders and 7 ferry boats carrying 130 commuters rescued the passengers and crew of flight 1349. The best of New York came together. It took them 24 minutes'Surely an inspiring conclusion, but I admit my immediate reaction was 'who are you kidding?'. I'm not cynically negating the fact that the 155 passengers of the fateful flight were rescued by competent and dedicated New Yorkers, but it's Captain Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger aka Sully who definitely saved them. And that's why he's got the lion-share of praises, that's why he got the film.I worked in an airline company for more than three years, this film is about January 15, 2009 but I mostly remember June 1 of the same year. It was the day I started working and when -in a tragic irony- the Airbus flight from Rio to Paris crashed. My immersion into the flight world coincided with that event and for some metaphysical reason, I read every single article about that crash, which -according to the investigation- was tragic because avoidable. Basically, if it wasn't for the pilot letting the co-pilot in command, for the co-pilot taking the wrong indications, for several 'if' factors, two hundreds of people wouldn't have perished in one of Airbus' deadliest accidents.But 'Sully' made me relativize all these computer-generated inquiries that end up pointing a posthumous accusation against the pilots. Indeed, it doesn't take a NTSB expert to know that accidents are the result of equations featuring many parameters among them human factor, there's never one sole cause of accident. This is why planes are still statistically the safest travelling ways, and this is why it doesn't say much about how stressful a flight plane is. This is why, on a personal note, I think my last hour is coming whenever turbulences start. This is why I take my chances with buses, boats and cars. Hell, this is why people still applaud the pilot when he lands.Why should they? Isn't it part of their job? In the short documentary-feature about Sully, he reminds us that pilots have to fly well every time, it's a job that doesn't allow one hazardous move or uncertainty. I worked in the freight business where everything was processed and pre-planned from A to Z, freight isn't living people, but lives are always at stakes during a flight. That's why pilot is an ace job, when you have hundreds of lives depending on you every day, you can't afford a mistake... but as Sully also says this time in the film 'everything is unprecedented until it happens for the first time'.Clint Eastwood shows us a man confronted to such situation with only 208 seconds to react. In what should have been a routine flight, birds are sucked into the two engines making both unusable, and the only solution is an emergency landing on the closest runway. The altitude is low, he can't reach an airport without flying over New York City and he's got less than a minute to make up his mind. Of course, there's not much suspense since we know he made the right choice by landing on the Hudson river. But suspense isn't Eastwood's concern, he doesn't care about the 208 seconds but the 24 minutes.Indeed, after his 'Invictus' and 'American Sniper' and before the '15:17 to Paris' Eastwood seemed to have grown a cinematic fondness on real-life heroes. I guess it's a generational appreciation of men who were capable of taking the right decision at the right time and inspire the best out of the people. Mandela in 'Invictus' took unpopular decisions that eventually united South-Africans. Chris Kyle might have been blinded by his patriotism but became an inspiration to his companions. Sully is made in the same Eastwoodian vein, he wouldn't call himself a hero, but don't ever tell him he made the wrong decision.The problem with 'Sully' though is that the film takes a situation of a few minutes and needlessly stretches it for the sake of cinematic viability. In a non-linear narrative, it switches back and forth between moments where he's hailed as a hero and where he's criticized by the NTSBC investigation. Moments where he seems to go through a PTSD phase and moments where he reminisces about his past. The investigation is perhaps the best part of the film and it makes everything else feel as 'fillers', Laura Linney is not being given the most grateful role of her career as the long-suffering wife and the film could have done without Katie Couric calling Sully a fraud in an imagination sequence. Why would he be a fraud if he never pretended to be a hero?The not-so subtle point of Eastwood is betrayed by that 'best of New York' disclaimer. The film opens with a nightmarish vision of 'what could have been' had Sully followed the instructions by the book instead of his precious instinct and it ends with a needlessly graphic recreation of September 11. Maybe the opening and ending elevate Sully as a heroic figure because he could inspire the best of New York like the terrorist attacks did, but by saving lives instead. An Egyptian taxi driver praises him for having restored his faith in humanity in a year that started with the crisis, Madoff and Middle-East wars. It wasn't just the perfect timing but the perfect time.Now, I enjoy a good inspirational film like anyone but I can't say the film captivated me as 'Invictus' did or elicited a reaction as strong as 'American Sniper' (even though it was a negative one). The film struck me as a poor man's 'Apollo 13' or a film Steven Spielberg could have made between two blockbusters. I liked it for its informative value but I enjoyed the real smiling Sully more than Hanks' grim all-serious performance... so maybe the story was better suited for a documentary?",7,4,4,24 June 2018
Princess Mononoke," The Defying Creation about Deified Creatures...
","I saw 'Princess Mononoke' twice the same weekend but I'm not sure I grasped half of what makes it such a great movie. Even 'great' is too vague a word; so many 'great' movies are not one-tenth the film 'Princess Mononoke' in style, content and universal implications. Even after two viewings, I can only provide a superficial overview on the story and a meager but enthusiastic review of what constitutes one of the best animated movies of the last decades. To think that the same year, Disney came up with 'Hercules' gives you an idea of where the real magic of animation operatedthanks to the most imaginative creator and most accomplished artist of his generation: Hayao Miyazaki. Indeed, imagination and artistry never got along so well since Walt Disney. Now, to the story.Although set in medieval Japan, 'Princess Mononoke' ventures between the realms of history and fantasy, in a universe where the spirits of a God-like Nature govern the lives of (precisely) all living creatures: animals, plants and even men, they all coexisted in harmony until the age of deforestation. The film opens when a wild demonically possessed creature attacks the village of Ashitaka. And the tone is set from the start: the monster looks like a giant boar recovered by a sort of tentacles looking like writhing snakes, the drawing dwarfs any CGI abomination. You might as well compare a Rembrandt with a 4-year old kid's painting. The film was made in the late 1990's at the dawn of the CGI frenzy and when 3D animation would drive half the box-office grosses, but all the special effects of the world will never hold a candle to the power of hand-painting. 'Princess Mononoke', the highest-grossing movie in Japan but soon-to-be dethroned by 'Titanic', required a level of precision that couldn't do without traditional drawing. Miyazaki resorted to computer for a few hundred shots, only 1% of celluloid, but it says something about the man's pragmatism as he could also embrace technology to keep a fair balance between his stylish and narrative visions.And it works. When Ashitaka defeats the monster, everything looks real and the injury resulting from the fight doesn't have the contrivance of a 'magical' plot device. Ashitaka's arm is infected by a mysterious curse that will ultimately cause his death although giving him temporary superpowers (like decapitating someone with his a simple arrow shot). The village's wise woman tells him he must be exiled for his own good, to save his arm with the help of the Gods of the forests. Then starts the heroic and epic journey of the young Prince. From what I read, a few words were mistranslated, he's not actually a Prince and the girl who gives him the talisman isn't his sister, they're actually lovers. It doesn't undermine the comprehension of the story but it shows that the film is impregnated by Japanese culture and some idioms might be lost in translation. Even the title is misleading: Mononeke doesn't refer to the name of the Princess, but her status as a 'possessed monster or outcast', this description, from human perspective, isn't objective but it reflects her status as someone between two worlds. Her real name is San and she was raised by the Goddess-wolf. San is like a counterpart to Ashitaka, both human protagonists deeply related to the animal world, one by choice and one by fate. While San resents humans for their destructive actions and their effects on animals (we'll learn later that the boar-demon was cursed by a bullet lodged in his body), Ashitaka is a collateral damage of men's actions but he's incapable of hatred, and empathize with both animals' and men's pleas. As usual with Miyazaki, this is not your typical 'good vs. evil' story. The closest character to a villain is Lady Eboshi, the chief of Irontown, and she cuts trees to make iron and build the fortress where many social outcasts, ex-brothel workers and lepers work in exchange of food and protection. Eboshi has understandable motives and she's also a powerful woman respected by men and therefore, needing to assert her authority. Even the main antagonist, Jiko-bo, a sneaky monk, has a mission: taking the head of the Forest Spirit for the Emperor, he's like a government worker, so to speak. Ashitara is like the centerpiece of an arena where creatures struggle to find peace and harmony; even the Gods Animals are unequally pacific. The environmentalist statements aren't spoken at the expenses of realism. We do root for Nature and accept Miazaki's protection of environment but there's the idea of people defending their own interests, for their own survival. It's not realism, but lucidity. But lucidity doesn't undermine the dazzling visuals: the forest looks majestic, the wolves have that furry amplitude that shows how determined they are, and the magic displayed whether to convey a sense of danger or beauty is hypnotically beautiful. But that's only the tip of the iceberg, there's more to see in the film. Even the romance between San and Ashirata is handled with a sense of maturity that respects the coherence of the plot and our intelligence. 'Princess Mononoke' surpasses everything Disney made in the last years before and everything Peter Jackson will make, CGI can look fine but you're always tempted to cheat with it, computer does the trick. There was a screen writing manual titled 'Save the Cat!' and explaining how most movies, especially on the field of animation and fantasy / sci-fi journeys were based on the same structure. I dare anyone to find a usual pattern in 'Princess Mononoke', this is a film that defies all the conventions and where every frame is original and surprising. To put it simply, 'Princess Mononoke' is a great animated film with a great story, can you ask for more?",10,1,1,26 June 2017
Jurassic Park," 1993: The Year Spielberg was the King of the World...
","So many contrasts cohabite in 'Jurassic Park', prehistoric relics and living dinosaurs, living dinosaurs and men's technology, men's technology and their total disregard for nature, the culminating point of the homo (not-so) sapiens and the downfall caused by his hubris. So in a man's creation that couldn't possibly go wrong, we have another man's creation bound to fail... with extreme prejudice.Indeed, as the film's arc quote says 'life will find a way', but once you give life that little impulse, it might come hand in hand with death, as part of its great cycle. And dinosaurs might simply remind men that they can be God, but they can be dinner as well. That's why 65 million years separate us from our reptilian ancestors. Men could deal with lions, tigers and bears, but dinosaurs, oh, my!But that didn't affect the enthusiasm of John Hammond portrayed by the unforgettable Richard Attenborough. Hammond is an eccentric businessman with such dangerous ideas they fall into the mad scientist trope, a mix of Willy Wonka (for the cane and the dreamy location), Dr. Moreau (for the Island and the dangerous implications) and Colonel Sanders (for the white suit, the elderly gentleman manners and the cunning business sense). But don't get it wrong, Hammond is a small player compared to his real-life counterpart Spielberg who spared no expenses to make the title work better than the park itself, generating almost a billion dollar of profit out of 65 million dollars for marketing, starting with the number itself.It's jut as if there was something coming full circle in the history of evolution, in the name of science and Spielberg's fascination for the little ideas that grow into visual wonders and challenges for Hollywood craftsmanship. 'Jurassic Park' is in fact Spielberg coming full circle with his own career evolution, two decades after his groundbreaking 'Jaws'. There's no doubt that it was Spielberg and only Spielberg who was capable to make such a film, Michael Crichton wrote and conceived the idea but Spielberg made it a universally acclaimed family-friendly blockbuster and the landmark that redefined film-making and started the digital revolution.With the same 'J', 'Jurassic Park' is the 'Jaws' of the nineties ensuring a smooth transition from practical to computer-aided effects. In the make-it-or-break-it moment of the film, when Sam Neil and Laura Dern (playing a couple of paleontologists) discover the real attraction of the park, their dropped jaws echo our own wonder, Neil's tears looked like what could've been George Melies' reaction had he seen how far cinema went. And that these effects still hold up today is a tribute to the perfectionism of Spielberg.Spielberg who, by the way, was still capable to direct 'Schindler's List' while supervising this project from Poland. Maybe the former was too personal a movie it could only force him to take the latter as personally on a technical level... and with a more business-driven hindsight. After all, if it's any consolation for Spielberg's detractors, the film also betrays his own hubris: you can't help but spot the Spielberg's self-awareness in that shot of 'Jurassic Park' merchandising shop.But can we blame him? This is the man who made the ultimate thriller with 'Jaws', the ultimate family film 'E.T.', both became the highest grossing movies of their time. Spielberg combined the two, he made a thriller that could attract children with a minimal parental guidance, 'Jurassic Park' became the highest-grossing movie of all time before 'Titanic'. So this was his momentum, in 1993, Spielberg also director of the Best Picture winner, was the King of the World. And the king of action movies as well.The action sequences utilize mechanisms inherited from Hitchcock like the race against the clock with a kid climbing down a temporarily deactivated electric fence and the gears being switched on, or taken from 'Jaws', the suggestion of the T-rex' presence through the infamous shaking glass of water. For a film that prepares us so much to a monster movie, the writers' imagination created moments of pure ingenuousness and managed to turn the most mundane places such as cars or kitchens into deadly traps. But while 'Jaws' had a no-holds-barred rule, Spielberg knew very well a 90s audience wasn't ready to see kids serving as appetizers (still, he didn't turn them into these 1970s know-it-all brats).So the film also works in spite of its relative predictability. As groundbreaking and powerful as it is, it is also symptomatic of the trend of the 90s where we know the characters who are likely to survive and save the day thanks to aforementioned skills. Spielberg doesn't make his cast nonentities and allows them to share their views about recreating life but subtlety isn't his strongest suit. While Goldblum plays the most interesting character as the chaos theorist insisting that whatever can go wrong will go wrong, Sam Neil's disliking of kids (set in a distasteful opening scene) seemed far fetched and only there for a needless arc, the kids in the film were nice enough and and he had great chemistry with them.But these considerations hardly matter when the real star are the special effects and the dinosaurs. Forget the blatant lack of security, the improbable survivals or the contrived ending, Spielberg knew people didn't watch a film like screenwriting students, his common denominator instinct paid off. He knew we would all be at the edge of our seat when the T-Rex pops up and we would all go 'aaaw' with the brachiosaurus or the baby dinosaur. Spielberg was a visionary showman like Hammond, but HE left nothing to chance.I remember I was eleven when I participated to a game show and one of the questions I got was 'which animals are featured in 'Jurassic Park'?' (I hadn't seen the film yet but no one could miss the movie, its poster and the whole publicity around it) the film was undeniable in 1993 and is still today.",9,1,1,7 March 2019
Beetlejuice," Wacky Horror Picture Show...
","A wacky Tim Burton at a time when his muse Johnny Depp was still the thug-arresting hearthrob of '21 Jump Street', a sweet Geena Davis, a boyish Alec Baldwin and practical Gremlins-like special effects... well, if 'Beetlejuice' doesn't scream 80s, I don't know what it does. This is a little gem of horror mixed with comedy that might delight every member of the family though I suspect kids who've grown up after the 2000s might find the film a bit too silly and childish... a complain they'd share with eminent critics of that era such as Ebert and Siskel. Both deplored that the titular character brought too much obnoxiousness to an already loaded story and they got rapidly tired of his antics, but didn't they think the same of 'Ace Ventura'?I think 'Beetlejuice' is a film that might disorient the first-time viewer because of its constant swinging between fantasy and horror and naughty comedy, but I suspect this is the kind of experience that grows on you if you give it a chance. Michael Keaton as 'Beetlejuice' might be a tad too prankish and annoying but thankfully he only appears midway through the film and meanwhile, the main characters had already won our hearts. I agree that the relationship between Baldwin and Davis brings a certain sweetness to the film sometimes at the expenses of the plot. I couldn't really accept that such lovely persons would indulge to scare the new occupants on their residence just because of some disturbance... especially since they aren't played by the least likable actors either.Jeffrey Jones aka Emperor Joseph aka Ferris' archenemy Rooney is a serene father who wants to contemplate birds and enjoy his nest of serenity, Catherine O'Hara, aka Kevin's mom is the lady of the house eccentric sculptor who won't have any intruders disrupt her oasis of artistic creativity and finally, Winona Ryder is the emo malcontent adolescent who grows an interest on the former residents, if not a liking.In fact, if we except the nasty decorator Otho, the character who comes the closest to an antagonist is Beetlejuice himself, though his main purpose is to get the house rid of the family by operating let's say an exorcism from the other side. The premise is interesting but the film is filled with so many enchanting special effects and funny scenes that a new character popping up near the end wasn't a necessity. As hard as it is to imagine the film without Beetlejuice, it's funny that the film's most memorable moments don't feature him. But I won't get too nitpicky, Keaton is obviously playing a career-defining role and I suspect if it wasn't for his performance, he might not have caught the attention of Burton for his next project (a clue: it's another special effect movie with a one-word title starting with 'B').Keaton is certainly as wacky and crazy as his cartoon adaptation but his performance is too straight-forward and doesn't call for subtlety, a pity for a film that contains so many inspiring moments such as the afterlife bureaucracy and the memorable case-worker played by a chain-smoking and scene-stealing Sylvia Sidney.At the peak of its creativity, 'Beetlejuice' is a fantastic and spectacular fantasy entertainment filled with hilarious moments: a great twist at the end of the opening credits, a hilarious choregraphy with the 'Banana-Boat Song' and a funny waiting room sequence involving a silly-looking creature with a shrunk head. The film won an Oscar for Best Make-up but oddly enough, it didn't garner any Golden Globe nomination for Best Comedic Actor to Keaton. I must admit his performance never really bothered me except for one moment that carried a lot of gravitas (when the couple's ghosts started to age and their bodies turning into skeletons), the scene hit a really sensitive chord and it did so well that I really wanted someone to get rid of Beetlejuice instead of the humans. For that scene in particular I would agree with Ebert's criticism.But with some perspective, 'Beetlejuice' is a fun product of its time, with a right balance of humor (mostly visual), heart and special effects, and these aspects work so much that the cynicism brought by the titular character might feel like the real intrusion. There are moments where the house looks overcrowded and the humor overdone but 'Beetlejuice' is still one of these little classics of the 80s, and time did justice to the little films of that glorious and extravagant decade.",8,1,2,22 March 2020
The Simpsons Movie," Not a 'D'Oh!' ... Not an 'Excellent' either ...
","More than the film, I remember the event it was. For the first time, the fans were about to see their favorite show in a movie theater. Could you imagine that? Bart, Homer, Marge, Mr. Burns, Moe, Barney, all the Springfield town painting the big screen in a dazzling and bright yellow  that was one movie adaptation no one could ever refuse. A sure hit for the fans, but not necessarily a sure critical success. I think we should all admit that we all watched the film because it was a novelty on itself, and no Simpson fan, no parent of a Simpson fan could miss it, but the certainty of a critical success was more than debatable. The excitement was sincere but so was the apprehension.Now, after five years, I can't really put my finger exactly in what went wrong in 'The Simpsons Movie'. In fact, I almost want to say that nothing was wrong; it had the fun, the wit, the satire, the zaniness but also the tenderness, the warmth and the heart of some of the greatest Simpsons' episodes. But when you dilute it in almost one hour and twenty minutes, it loses its spectacular value and you can't help but notice some slower moments plot-wise. Whatever it is, it's exactly why I can't call the film 'great', but just a 'very good' with some great moments. And I didn't even have high expectations take it from a Simpsons' fan.I didn't expect a lot because like so many hardcore fans (I watch the show almost every day and know hundreds of episodes by heart), I got used to disappointments. As I posted once on IMDb, there was a time when 'The Simpsons' were influencing Pop-Culture but now, it's Pop Culture influencing 'The Simpsons', the result is not bad, but the episodes are generally hit-or-miss, rarely average, either great or lame. I could picture the Simpsons movie disappointing me, and I kept this feeling as a psychological shield so I could never be truly disappointed enough to abandon my faith over the show's chances of improvement. Talk about negative preconceived ideas but let's say it was just some sort of self-preservation instinct.But the first minutes were surprisingly hilarious and they really made me lower my guard, the sight of little Ralph Wiggum trumpeting along with the Fox fanfare was very funny and encouraging (too bad, one of the film's highlights started so soon). And it went on with the 'Itchy and Scratchy' bit and Homer's self referential accusation. The opening sequence couldn't get more creative with Frink passing along the whispering clouds and saying 'the movie' or Bart writing on the chalkboard that he'll never download this film illegally, I could sit and eat comfortably my popcorn expecting the opening sequence to go until the couch but then suddenly, the film switched with the sight of a unknown pop group singing in a concert. The 'Da-da-da' lip-synching was funny but I thought the cut was too abrupt.I would have preferred the film to take its time to set-up the film as it does for TV episodes. Maybe it was eager to get to the point, since we all knew everybody and the 'Titanic' reference was very clever. Overall, the film wouldn't start to worry me  not until Grandpa's outburst in the church (which was my first alert) and the whole Spider-pig thing (the fact that we don't see the pig after that, damages the solidity of this plot element) and when I understood that the film would only focus on the family. I thought it was a mistake because the material would have served better for a TV episodes' plot. The film didn't exploit all the possibilities that were offered to it. It didn't even had songs, perfect leverages for most posterity. Remember 'South Park', what most people remember from it? The songs.And the 'South Park' movie had at least the merit to feature all the population of the town and make a very clever satire, while 'The Simpsons' focused on the family and didn't use the characters the way we'd expect. After all, couldn't Mr. Burns be the main antagonist, the one who'd make this dome on Springfield, he did far worse when he decided to block the sunshine. I also wished there was more Barney, Karl and Lenny, Krusty the Clown, and all the great supporting characters that'd populated the show since 1990, but the movie felt like a concentration of three kind of plots : Homer gets a new job, Homer screws up, Problem in the family, not the best of these recent years.'The Simpsons' have always been synonyms of smartness, unpredictability, a clever way to be ahead of what we'd expect, it's precisely because I have a tenderness for the show that I felt bad to predict all what was going to happen, the whole redemption of Homer, him reconciling with Bart and all that stuff. I didn't see everything coming, but then again, I never said the movie was disastrous, nor that I was disappointed, simply that it had the potential to be greater than what it actually is. Although I believe it should have been nominated for the Best Animation film Oscar category, if only because it's hand-drawn for once, I don't think the creators wanted to make 'a masterpiece'. Nonetheless, the film is qualitatively good, in the same level than the Simpsons as a TV show in 2007.But I only wish I could have been more enthusiastic to review this film as I would to one of my favorite episodes.",7,0,1,16 July 2012
All the President's Men," 'Taxi Driver''s gripping realism, 'Network''s audacious intelligence and 'Rocky''s inspirational message, combined in one film ...
","Is it me, or do I feel like I need to watch 'All The President's Men' again before reviewing it? I don't know if I should feel enthusiastic about the gripping thriller that captivated me during more than one hour and half, or angry towards this intricate script whose intelligence exceeded the limits of my understanding. Well, I had enough trouble to try to remember 'who was who' in this cinematic puzzle, so I prefer to spare myself a sterile dilemma  and let me just say that I probably didn't get 85% of the film, but overall, for what it was, I really enjoyed it.I know I'm a bit harsh, but it's not meant as an attempt to diminish the pedagogic and entertaining value of Alan J. Pakula's film: I've learned more about journalistic techniques of investigation thanks to this movie than any other. Besides, this film has the merit not to fall into clichés we would expect in a drama involving one of the most featured professions in the big screen. No, we don't need to get immersed in the private lives of Bob Woodward (Robert Redford) and Carl Bernstein (Dustin Hoffman), to know if they're womanizers or not, or to get a whole introspection into their personal motives. The movie's premise won't be praised enough for its simplicity; it's about two journalists investigating the Watergate scandal, feeling this could lead to an even bigger political earthquake that may shake the countries' bigger instances. FBI, CIA, White House, you name it. It's about that, and no other subplot, romantic or not, will deviate this film from this clear trajectory.But a clear trajectory is not exempted from many wrong tracks, dead ends, long pauses and so on and so forth. The tightness of the script combined with the fast-paced editing and the acting so natural, you totally forget you're watching Hoffman and Redford, all these factors create the feeling of an exhausting road movie where the quest is the truth, and the way to get it is paved of many questions, meetings, informers, phone calls, and other journalistic tricks to deliver parcels of knowledge from the mouths of people. This quest provides some of the most memorable scenes of the film, including the meetings with Hal Holbrook, as the enigmatic Deep Throat, a character so fascinating, it's like reality has been even more creative than fiction, I'm sure he inspired the Cigarette Smoking Man from 'X-Files'. The whole movie is filled with many moments rooted in Pop-Culture, it made my enjoyment bigger because I watched a Simpson's parody before it. 'All The President's Men' features many encounters with supporting characters, it has probably inspired Oliver Stone's JFK, informers as so many pieces of a giant puzzle until it gets to something. This is the thrilling element of the film, and kudos to Alan J. Pakula who made such a tense and gripping film with absolutely no death, and considering the fact we all know how it will end, the movie's climax rewards our expectations quite well.Pakula's direction is so confident it didn't embarrass itself with an ending made of laughs and cheers, the victory is written in bold letters by a cold typewriter. And for some reason, the mention of what happened this day of August 9, 1974, after the climactic typing sequence is so satisfying that we do cheer inside ourselves as the quest has come to an end, and that Truth, Justice, and Civil Rights have won. The whole movie is full of these detached moments featuring Bernstein and Woodward as the tools Truth used to compromise Nixon. In the iconic library scene, the famous zoom out is a way to show our two men drown in an ocean of interrogations, with providence as only life-belt. In fact, let's admit it, 'Woodstein' had also a lot of luck in their investigation but that may be a proof that there was a kind of divine justice, almost poetic, that lead them to victory. Maybe they deserve, after all, their spot as #27 in AFI's Top 50 heroes, as they're true models of self-confidence, moral determination and perseverance guided by both a journalistic and unknowingly humanistic instinct. Pakula's direction is flawless in the film as it managed to create so much empathy to these characters, combined with a growing paranoid feeling indicating that they're starting to swim into troubled waters. If I wasn't so biased towards 'Rocky', I would probably have given the Oscar to the late director.1976 was indeed an incredible cinematic year, where four classics had to compete for the supreme honor. Yet, 'Rocky' won, and I guess, I'm in the minority satisfied with this result, for I had a small critic for each of 'Taxi Driver', too dark, 'Network', a script that was the real star and a too abrupt ending, and 'All the President's Men' which sinned by trying to be too intelligent. Yes, as I stated before, I felt like Pakula overestimated our ability to memorize so many names in one film. Sometimes, I just had to get the satisfaction from the feeling they were on something, more than the way they did. I didn't feel stupid but a bit frustrated, and when this sensation gets repetitive, it doesn't help. But for the directing, the editing, and the great performances, with a honorable mention to Jason Robards as Ben Bradlee, his Oscar-winning role, 'All The President's Men' deserves a place among the greatest political thrillers of the 70's, and the best death-less thrillers ... like '12 Angry Men', which also features Martin Balsam, an actor I have a real fondness for.A gripping realism à la 'Taxi Driver', a Lumet-ian directing a la 'Network' and an inspirational message à la 'Rocky', I wonder, if after all, I didn't judge the movie too severely and if 'All The President's Men' doesn't make the perfect combination of 'All the 1976 Great Films'",9,1,1,17 May 2011
The Wizard of Oz," There's no place like home ... no time like childhood ... no movie like 'The Wizard of Oz' ...
","Red like magical ruby slippers, yellow like a brick road to follow, green like the Emerald city, blue like a cloudless sky, violet like a floppy field  all the colors of the rainbow celebrate two magical universes with the same initials: cinema and childhood.'The Wizard of Oz' is and will forever be associated with a magnificent imagery, unforgettable songs such as 'Ding Dong! the Witch is Dead', 'We're off to see the Wizard', the catchy 'If I had...' songs, the Munchkins' high-pitched voices, Dorothy having the feeling 'not to be in Kansas' anymore, the shrill and scary voice of a green-faced evil witch and so on and so forth. With all these elements, it's comforting that the film lost against a worthy adversary, the iconic 'Gone with the Wind' from the same director. God, if there ever was a year where film-making triumphed, it's 1939, and the throne of Hollywood undoubtedly belonged to Victor Fleming.'The Wizard of Oz' is both a spectacular milestone for its first use of colors and groundbreaking visual effects and a timeless classic in the way it touched the heart of children from many generations, all over the world. It's fascinating how these two aspects drive the film's paradoxical nature as the ultimate escapism, plunging us in the dreamlike Technicolor vision of the enchanted land of Oz, yet concluding with the immortal 'There's no place like home'. 'Oz' captures through the innate power and insecurity of childhood a very poignant contradiction that reminds us how we used to dream of such places 'over the rainbow' and still were deeply rooted to our home, our family. And Kansas, with its sepia-like simplicity is Dorothy's home and we couldn't be happier for her when she was finally back.But as a set-up to this powerful finale, the whole film is a miraculous journey into a magical world where a group of friends will try to find the only person whose power could fulfill their wishes. Dorothy wants to go home, because she left her aunt worried after a frightening tornado destroyed the farm, the Scarecrow wants to have a brain, the Tin Man, a heart and needless to say what the Cowardly Lion wants. We all can identify with Dorothy or her friends because each one remains true to one of the many emotions that inhabit childhood, fear, awkwardness, joy, sadness, homesickness etc. And watching these three adult actors and an adolescent Judy Garland taking their roles with such dedication is the best tribute to the good old days' innocence. Those were the days ruled by Walt Disney and MGM's roaring lion, when people went to the movie theaters to escape, to dream  an even sadder desire when put in the tragic international context of the film.Speaking of my personal experience, I had 'The Wizard of Oz' in mind long before watching the film, with the unforgettable image of Dorothy and her three friends walking along the 'We're off to see the Wizard' song, one of these indelible shots in the history of film-making that invites us to re-enact them every once in a while. That's the secret of 'Oz', which makes any attempt to summarize the film pointless. Any other fantasy film can be more spectacular or penetrating but its popularity might mostly rely on the story, on the way it ends. Take Capra's 'It's a Wonderful Life', the whole significance of the film depends on the reception of the last act of the film, and kind of diminish the impact of the first scenes. In 'The Wizard of Oz', it's all about characters, scenes, songs, quotes, each sequence is as valuable and impacting as another, and more than anything, each one conveys a valuable lesson about and for children.Whether it's about children's adoration for their pet animals (Dorothy's adventure starts because she wanted to protect her dog Toto from the evil Miss Gulch) or about the value of friendship in order to face the adversity of the adult world, an undeniable pedagogical value elevates 'Oz' above all the other fantasy movies. It is, for once, not a coming-of-age, but a coming-to-realization story and a proud affirmation of the value of childhood in the way it intelligently mirrors our own memories of a time of misunderstanding, naivety, trust and fear and a perpetual leaning helping us to face the world, to accept it and moreover to accept ourselves (there's a subtle message about self-acceptance powerfully conveyed by the wizard, played by the jovial Frank Morgan). And the merit of these lessons is to be learned through action: Dorothy and her friends are never passive characters characters and that's crucial because it puts action as a necessary step before learning, and fear, not as a flaw, but a necessary step before learning about courage. 'The Wizard of Oz' provides also through the wizard's character, the man 'behind the curtain', a lesson about naivety and how child's eyes can easily trust or be impressed. In a way, it illustrates the sad reality that all the adults aren't trustworthy. Of course, some of them can be really mean and the film wouldn't have been half the masterpiece it is without the scene stealing performance of Margaret Hamilton as the Wicked Witch of the West, rightfully nominated #4 in the AFI Top 50 villains. The Witch happens to be a representation of Mrs. Gulch in Dorothy's dream, like most of the characters, including the three friends (farmhands in real-life) and the wizard  in a way, it helps us to keep in mind that Dorothy is only dreaming, which doesn't make her dream less impacting anyway.And bizarrely, as we forget it's all a dream, we cease to be marveled by the beauty of the cinematography and the special effects, forgetting that it was before CGI, before 'Star Wars', that's the miracle of 'The Wizard of Oz', and as a beautiful dream, its memory can be eternal",10,3,4,1 March 2012
The Martian," A little less 'Apollo 13', a little more 'Cast Away'...
","I read many critics calling 'The Martian' formulaic but I think it's a half-empty glass way to look at it. In fact, like many great movies, its plot is driven by two great concepts borrowed from other movies, but put together making a greater concept with a novelty as the cherry on the cake. Basically, 'The Martian' is 'Apollo 13' and 'Cast Away' on Mars, and it's so obvious I just read other reviews mentioning this combo, so I think we're reaching a general consensus here.Anyway, 'The Martian' has the crisis-management and triumph-of-human-brain-over-natural-adversity theme that usually inspire entertaining, pedagogical and inspirational stories, and it has the inevitable 'stranded in a desert island' vibe only this time, in a more exotic landscape, if exotic also means hostile, hellish... and reddish, well you can't get worse than being left alone in Mars, like Mark Watney. It's not the first film set on Mars, so not quite a novelty, but still, the first by Ridley Scott, so in terms of production designs and recreation of an extra-terrestrial setting, we have a director who mastered the Sci-fi genre at a time where half 'The Martian' cast was watching 'Sesame Street'.On that level, 'The Martian' is perfect to a documentary-like level.Now, let's get back to our combo. In 'Apollo 13' department, the film delivers exactly what we expect with the whole brainstorming moments, the internal tensions and conflicts within the NASA operators, the ethical dilemmas, the last-minute solutions, the decisions to make fast, and all these moments are served by terrific performances, especially from a trio of great actors Sean Bean, Chiwetel Efigogor and Jeff Daniels (whom I suspect is promised to play many authoritarian figures in the future given how natural bossy charisma he exudes). 'The Martian' isn't just a thrilling race against the Martian clock, it's also a great film about management. And that's where my criticism starts; the film should've been an ever better one about self-management.I think 'The Martian' lacked a little something on this aspect. We have a man, who's trapped in a planet, alone, with no one to help him light-years around, and for some reason, there's no real moment where Damon 'feels' alone, starting with the fact that he talks to his audience (in fact, a camera installed in the base, where he can leave information and messages 'for the record') it's the first departure from the usual 'desert island' silent discoveries, and it's not necessarily a bad thing. Actually, it was quite a pleasant surprise, not to have the character immediately desperate or scared, here's a guy who's trained to resist the pressure whether in a vessel or a stressful situation. Besides, he strikes as a very optimistic nature, capable to throw a few hilarious one-liners and it's like the situation is critical enough not to inject some extra level of pathos, and that's fine at first.Not only it's fine, but it's also realistic. Mark has the oxygen (available thanks to the oxygenator), but he's got to find out how to make food and water and water to make food, so there's no time to waste. And that's why the beginning is so promising in 'The Martian', it doesn't waste time, as if it was governed by the very urgency of the situation. Noland in 'Cast Away' was alone, but he had food and water, the real struggle was to cope with loneliness and accept his nihilistic future. Watney has no alternative, he does something or he dies, it's pure survival instinct. Do or do not, there's no try. And then, we see him, working for his life, growing plants, eating, drinking, exploring the planet, step by step, making first rudimentary contacts with the NASA, and then being able to communicate. But after one hour, he 'chats' with his NASA colleagues and, he's just like the child trapped in a well.My personal regret is that we never get a true emotional impression on his loneliness, it's physical, but the film is so in a rush to get to the rescue part that it doesn't allow itself at least ten or fifteen minutes for the main character. And I mean that because he was a fascinating, well-acted and intriguing one, so they could afford a little extra time for moments where basically 'nothing' happens, and where we try to find out what's going up in his mind. I understand Watney is supposed to be a sort of wisecracking guy, who's not probably the type of man to directly express his feelings, it's part of his nature, but that's what would have made a real breakdown, an emotionally rewarding moment. I waited desperately to see him reach a breaking point, to throw the potatoes all over the place, to cry of pain, hunger, exhaustion, but we never get that moment and it's a pity.It's a pity because I think it's precisely for this reason some perceived the film as formulaic, because it didn't take more chances with Damon. I don't mean to 'intellectualize' the film that much, it's a matter of emotions more than analysis, 'The Martian' had the entertainment valued so locked up that it could allow us to get deeper in the character, a sort of character study, without cheap emotional moments, just the nice amount. Not that it prevented Damon from getting his Oscar nomination, I guess he showed a few signs of vulnerability here and there, behind his restrained facade, but I wish there could be more 'Oscar-baity' moments, and be a real threat to Di Caprio this year, who had a flashier 'survivor' role in 'The Revenant'.But again, the designs were impeccable, the landscapes breath-taking, the special effects spectacular (once again, old-school Ridley Scott) and the acting good with a honorable mention to Jessica Chastain I forgot to mention. 'The Martian' is great entertainment, I wish it was just less about the rescue than the rescued.",8,2,4,19 February 2016
The Fighter," A good sports drama that pales in comparison with 'Rocky' and 'Raging Bull' ...
","'The Fighter' had everything to be a Knock-Out. Something about the kind of resurrection's stories that only cinema can powerfully tell. Something about self-confidence, determination and courage, making us identify with characters that incarnate this eternal struggle of human spirit, in order to triumph over the adversity ... thanks to a total physical and spiritual dedication. And which movie genre is more inspiring than Sports in that specific case? However, sports dramas is also a genre that can be considered a double edged sword when poorly executed, and inevitably falling into some clichés, the kind that ruined the classic 'Rocky' or provided movies ranked in the same category than purely entertaining action-driven flicks, looking more like flashy ads for video games or sports wear than films with real substance. And this is why only a handful of sports film had the honor to be nominated for Best Picture, and that most of them are about boxing.The particularity of Boxing movies and what makes them so inspiring is probably the fact that beyond the limits of the ring and the silver screen, this is the closest sport to define the very concept of life. If you consider your life as ring, you have the adversity, you must fight it, you hit, you're being hit, and at the end, either you stand, either you're in the floor, and in between, it's just you letting all your strength and everything that could fill your body with anger and frustration going out or all the motivation and confidence that could pump your heart and fill your veins with the appetite for winning, for proving yourself, for the ultimate triumph  boxing is about a self-destruction before the victory, about paying the biggest price to overcome the inner enemy that tries to knock you down, about getting beaten, getting ugly and finally getting the victory  or losing again, but it's never a victory in the ring, it's about fighting your own demons. And now that I think of it, the greatest boxing movies, which were regarded among the best sports films, were hardly about winning in the ring. This is not how I remember 'Rocky', 'Raging Bull' or 'Million Dollar Baby' anyway  and if I mention these three films, I guess it's because I believe 'The Fighter' is a good film, but which pales in comparison with its glorious predecessors.I think what lacks in this film is the element that must drive sports dramas: passion. Never in this film, had this passion been communicated, not through the lead character anyway: Micky Ward, played by Mark Whalberg. Micky is probably one of the most passive lead characters, in the worst way, the one that makes impossible to feel any empathy for him, sometimes sympathy, but most of the times, it rhymed with pity. Seriously, even though it's based on a true story, when he's not influenced by his bossy foul-mouthed mother Alice, played by Melissa Leo, and his ex-champion, crack-addicted, dim-witted half-brother, portrayed by an excellent Christian Bale, it's his girlfriend Charlene that convinces him to rebel and to think of his future. He never decides on his own, he's always influenced, and we don't really care for him because the other characters steal the scene with such efficiency, especially Christian Bale, that the results of the fight don't really matter. Ironically, even the way he wins his first match seems like a lucky shot more than a calculated strategy. His victory is a hold-up, just like his life, he let himself being hit before one or two deadly shots. The film lacks transitions : the kind that would have explained what Charlene found in Mickey to kiss him so tenderly after her boring date in the theater? Well, at least, it made us admire her sexy body early in the film, but I still prefer Rocky and Adrian's romance.It's a pity because it's such a dynamic film, driven by good performances. Unfortunately, the writing, pacing and directing didn't really match this quality. Too much arguing and shouting: at one point, the movie becomes a real mess that doesn't let you enough time to know the characters and understand their motives. Why is the mother so over-protective? How did Dicky become drug-addicted? What about this TV documentary? How did Dicky and Alice finally get along? Did they just decide to make peace and then it cuts directly to the final match, what happened between? Is what all Mickey needed from the beginning the right words between two rounds? Really? It could have been done better, seriously. And don't let me start about the sisters, these loud-mouthed chicks were obviously just comic reliefs and made the whole thing particularly laughable. But it could have been forgivable if we got to know the most important character, Micky. He seemed like a nice and obedient guy with a potential, with heart as they say, but at the end, he didn't change that much. And that's what disqualifies this film as a sports drama, when in general, it's more about a victory that goes beyond the arena, when ironically, those who don't win the game are the ultimate winners, because the victory was elsewhere.And despite his victory, I still had the feeling that there was something of a loser in the way Whalberg portrayed Micky, and it's no surprise that even in real life, the actor didn't get the Oscar nomination for the performance. He was the main character, and the movie sinned by not giving him too much chance to evolve, to please, to fascinate, to inspire us, it was more about evolution of situations told in a very contrived way: Micky with family, Micky rebelling, everyone reunited, and (surprise!) victory at the end. Sorry, but that victory was Dicky, Alice and Charlene's one. Micky was an outsider from beginning to end, and it's not the last shot of the film that would change my mind.",7,1,2,13 March 2011
Up in the Air," Firing people, a business that knows no crisis... in fact, it counts on it!
","'Up in the Air', from 'hip' director Jason Reitman, takes us back to that traumatizing year of 2009 where the future couldn't look any grimmer and anyone with a job felt like belonging to a Forbes club. I'm talking from experience, following that hypocritical euphemism, P&G 'let me go' at the end of 2008 and for six months, I couldn't count how many jobs I've applied to, how many fresh alumni friends I reached out to, and the same answer kept popping up: right now, we don't hire. I finally got me a job but that was a close call and it wasn't in Europe anyway; the crisis hadn't spread yet to North Africa.But how about Ryan Bingham's job? Surely one that was begging for a film adaptation: his mission is to travel all around American big cities... to fire people! Their bosses don't have the guts to do the dirty work, it might seem ludicrous but it's not that easy firing someone, it means a lot of paperwork, many legal ordeals, the kind of stuff you'd better leave to a specialist with a smile as polished as his briefcase. And that job reminded me of a gag from the 'Simpsons' episode when Bart's 'Angry Dad' was published on the Internet; realizing the company went bankrupt, he's socked that 'Bubbles can burst' and one of the workers who came to collect the furniture say 'It's a Golden Age for the repo business'. In the worst financial crisis after a certain Black Thursday in 1929, Bingham's company is living a real Golden Age.The merit of Reitman is to deal with a very unpleasant subject, one about people's lives being ruined basically in a rather tactful manner, and still making Ryan's job exciting to some degree, after all, it's not exactly life and death situation (although...). The film starts with a visually delightful opening sequence showing many air-view landscapes of American cities, the sequence provides the sort of dreamy imagery that might even cure someone who's got fear of flying (including myself). These are the sights Ryan enjoys on a daily basis, spending more days aboard planes under cotton-like clouds than Irish people under a rainy sky. The sequence provides us comforting images before we discover what the game is about.The film opens with various documentary-like reactions of people seeing their existential edifices collapse, It's touching and poignant but never pathetic, a sequence with Zach Galifianakis sets up the job in a didactic way, it's all about selling the same speech, telling people that anyone who 'build an empire' sat in a similar place and that's what strengthened them. Looking at these people's devastated faces, we know they don't buy the line, but somewhat they accept it because they're at such a low point that anything cheerful is welcome. In another wonderfully written scene with J.K. Simmons, his character says at one point 'you're supposed to cheer me up'. Bingham knows he's got to deal with adult and rational people but in a very irrational and emotionally fragile situation. It's a tough job and he takes it very seriously.And one thing for sure, after the first expositional act, we get the idea; Bingham travels across airport check-points as smoothly and confidently as Henry Hill taking Karen from the side-entrance to the restaurant in 'Goodfellas', it's his territory, his reason to be, as he says 'to know me is to fly with me'. Hotels are his second domain, in one of them, he meets Alex (Vera Ferniga) a woman whose job is never explicated, but all we know is that it exposes her to the same routine than Bingham. After a few introductions, they compare their bank cards and their experiences with car rentals and hotels and Bingham reveals his lifelong dream, collecting one million miles, and the dialogue in that scene, with all its double entendre is one of the film's delights. There's a reason Clooney was perfect for that role.There's a lot of 2009 Clooney in that competent man but estranged to his family or the very notion of family living occasional romances with no tomorrows. It's a hackneyed sentence but it fits him perfectly, he's the man 'married to his job'. But one woman might contradict this plan, a pint-sized ambitious newcomer who came up with a new idea: in-sourcing. Why go to the extent of travelling all around the world when everything can be settled through videoconference? The boss (Jason Bateman) finds the idea interesting, but Bingham finds the right way to tell her that technology isn't exactly the best way to handle human relationships and suggest an initiating tour so she can understand the real intricacies of the business. As Natalie, Kendrick plays the opposite of Alex, she goes from confidence to disillusion while the more mature Alex is confident but resigned. In many aspects, they're the most human characters of the film and the indirect triggers to Bingham's hidden humanity hidden under his cynical armor.There's a little running gag involving a miniature picture of his sister and future husband he carries in various places like that gnome in 'Amelie', but it takes the relationships with both Natalie and Alex to grasp the emptiness of his life. Natalie's idealism might be shaken but never turn into cynicism, as for Nathalie, a scene had me scared: when Clooney left one of his darling conferences about his 'backpack' metaphor, racing across the airport, I was afraid it would be one of these contrived 'declaration' scenes but it's fascinating the way the film tie the two themes together: love and jobs.The final montage shows fired people saying how they went through it thanks to their family or their beloved one, it's not just a light of hope but a challenging ending after a fascinating character study: can you live without a job? Or without love? One is for a living? But is living possible without the other?",9,1,1,17 November 2019
From Here to Eternity," So long as there are men...
","That's the translation of the French title, and I like it. So long as there are men ... there will be wars, and lives and loves torn apart......so long as these things are, there will be the stuff that makes such movies as 'From Here to Eternity'. And getting back to the original title, in anything is to be deemed eternal in 'From Here to Eternity' it is without a doubt Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr's intense and passionate kiss on a Hawaiian beach.Sure there have been kisses in movies before, remember Rhett and Scarlett's shadows getting closer while war painted the background in bright tones of orange and yellow, a passion burning like the city of Atlanta... yet 'From Here to Eternity' surpasses that kiss thanks to two last-minute strikes of genius, earning the film its ticket to immortality : they kiss each other horizontally, lying on the wet sand, and like fire in 'Gone with the Wind', natural elements interfere through the wave hitting the couple, the little touch to be parodied zillion times. It's not romantic love but nature in motion, sheer passion: he loves women...
...and she loves men.... and that's that.I knew it would be impossible not to mention this scene, but there is more in what makes the film such an endearing classic, even more to be compared with 'Gone With the Wind' as it was the first film to equal its record of 8 Academy Awards, including Best Picture. But this isn't any Best Picture winner, the film has a strange capability to please your eyes without trying hard, to challenge your thoughts without being intellectual, to touch your heart without being sentimental and to be erotic by only suggesting... it's a fascinating and insightful gallery of character studies disguised as entertainment or what some would call War movie or Romance.But there isn't much war in 'From Here to Eternity' and not much romance,
the idyll on the beach was so iconic everyone forgot that it was followed by an argument less than a minute after. After the wave-kiss, they'd never have an opportunity to be so physically and passionately in love, for there is an obstacle called duty. And there isn't much war either, only when the film culminates with the Pearl Harbor attacks that the second romance between Montgomery Clift and Donna Reed (playing a prostitute) gets overly melodramatic. By the time the film becomes more Hollywood-like, it's over, women left and wept, men died and others got ready to it.And that sad irony is what the film carries deeply in its core, thanks to a magnificent script adapted by Daniel Taradash from James Jones' novel, it is poetically summed up in Lancaster's farewell line to a dead Clift 'You couldn't play it smart'. As Private Robert E. Lee Prewitt, Clift played a stubborn soldier who refused to box for his platoon because of a tragic accident, for much of Captain Holmes' displeasure who pulled the strings to get his middleweight champion. Retrospectively, boxing would have spared him months of humiliations, harassment, and so non-military treatment... without the championship even happening at the end. Well, no one saw Pearl Harbor coming.Basically, Prew was torn between his status as a soldier and his moral independence and ironically (again), that's what earned him the respect of Sgt. Warden (Lancaster) who could recognize a great soldier if he saw one. Prew represents this kind of lone wolves cherished by the director Fred Zinneman, the likes of Will Kane or Sir Thomas More. And Clift gives an intense performance as hard-nosed Prew, his piercing look threatened more than his body and defied anyone to shaken his integrity. Speaking of which I'm glad Zinneman gave the example by not surrendering to Harry Cohn's initial choices including Rita Hayworth, William Holden and Eli Wallach.But Lancaster was the only choice they first agreed on and he couldn't have been more perfectly casted. Indeed, Warden is not your typical Sergeant, if anything, nothing is typical in the film, he's quite easygoing, getting away from every situation with his killer smile and a charisma working with both men and ladies and he's enjoying his office work without minding playing the assistant for a less competent hierarchical superior. But he falls in love with his boss' wife and only becoming an officer can solve his dilemma. But like Prew, he feels his duty is to serve the Army and not even love can change that. Even Warden is incapable to 'play it smart', because it's not about being smart, but simply about being true to your personality.Only women are capable of changing. Kerr as Karen was a honorable woman turning into the Army 'obligee', while Alma was a prostitute trying to become honorable, the film is a successful of fascinating contradictions, even more delightful because many actors played against types, Kerr, more used to sophisticated and distinguished ladies play a repressed nymphomaniac while Donna Reed was the eternal Mary from 'It's a Wonderful Life' (she won the Oscar for that role) And how about Frank Sinatra who accepted to be underpaid to get the part (no horse-head behind a deserved Oscar) and good old Marty (Ernest Borgnine) the villainous Fatso Hudson (Ernest Borgnine).But aren't we all against-type players? Isn't the conflict between duty and personality, the real war in the film? But you can't force people to be what they aren't and love be damned if it ever meant compromising, and this is why by the end, those who played it square didn't necessarily win the game. Neither the others, but only because the film had to sugarcoat some elements from the original novel to please the censors and the Army. Still, with such great performances (nominated in four acting categories), an intelligent script and an unforgettable kiss......well, the title says it all.",10,0,0,13 November 2018
V for Vendetta," V for Vox Populi, Verity, Victory, Veni, Vidi, Vici...
","Or 'V for Versatility'? Indeed, when it doesn't warn about the risk of totalitarianism pending over democracies, through the Orwellian depiction of a Britain ruled by a Big Brother-like figure, yelling orders on a giant wall-size screen, and played by John Hurt,'V' is a captivating cat-and-mouse chase between the rebels and the armed hands of the Law, characterized by two opposites: Stephen Rea as the good cop Finch and Tim Piggot-Smith as Creedy, the overzealous fascist with an ugly mug.Of course, the main attraction of the film is the titular V, that justice warrior hiding behind the now-iconic Guy Fawkes' mask and signing, like a modern-day Zorro, all his deeds with the mark V. As easy with words as he is with knives, V is a really fascinating creation we owe to the genius of comic-book artist Alan Moore. He makes his entrance when a young woman, coincidentally named Evey (Natalie Portman), breaks the curfew and is assaulted by two members of a local militia named 'Fingermen'. V doesn't believe in coincidences and sees in Evey the light of hope to shine on the future generations. Together, they meet on the 5th of November, and as a homage to the Gunpowder Plot of 1605, when Catholics attempted to destroy the House of Parliament, V orchestrates the destruction of the Old Prison.And with 1812 Tchaikovski Overture as an accompaniment, 'orchestrates' is the right word. The opening scene sums up what makes 'V for Vendetta' a great entertainment, it is both visually and intellectually captivating. It is the kind of experiences that urge you to go to Wikipedia so some extra knowledge can make the plot a little more understandable, and sometimes, plausible. For instance, I live in France where, recently, the government revealed the existence of a big database containing 60 Millions of names, which means the entire French population. This comes within the framework of the fight against terrorism but when you think deeper, you realize that a government will always have a 'good reason'. In 'V for Vendetta', we discover the extents of the tyranny: banning and killing homosexuals, Muslims, communist or atheists, and it is revealed near the end that it started with a 'virus' plot.I don't see Illuminati everywhere, I know that some conspiracy theories are absurd but they shouldn't be used as an alibi against those that make sense and can be proved. The merit of James McTeigue's film is not to denounce something that might happen but to tell us that it might happen. The film was made in 2005, after the September 11 attacks, but the events prove them right, I just love a part where Finch, disillusioned, know that things will go out of control, starting with an incident that will give an excuse for the government to bring the army. That's how the Arab Springs begun and today, it changed the map of the world, for better and for worse, the worse is that it planted the seed of terrorism and Islamophobia in European countries. If there ever is a Third World War, it would be ignited by these two elements.I just read a complaint from a IMDb user about the positive way the Quran was depicted, and I was wondering if that comment didn't prove that hatred was already marching in. It's very interesting that a character played in the film was killed because he had a Quran, if you look at the perception of Islam today, due to events that are certainly not caused by the vast majority but a fanatic minority manipulated by foreign groups and God knows who, you'll see that we're not far from this reality. Ironically, for all its positive portrayal of Muslims as victims or camp-candidates (a similitude shared with the other visionary Sci-fi movie 'Children of Men'), religion is painted in a negative light, starting with the Bishop portrayed as a filthy pedophile.The standing the films seems to take is that the first victims will be minorities and the film even includes a poignant lesbian romance in the story. But who knows, maybe the real dictatorship will come from hyper capitalism that would ban every form of spirituality. The fluidity of the plot sometimes derails in order to make a political statement, and I wish the film took more time to be a political satire than a Manichean thriller. It is also ambiguous in the way it denounces a form of totalitarian violence while portraying violence as the means to an end. The most glorious moment of the film, was the magnificent street marching with all London inhabitants wearing the Fawkes' mask, and when the soldiers had surrendered, V had virtually won.So, did we need to see Big Ben destroyed? The people had seized the power, it was a revolution per se, and by inspiring them, the figure of V has achieved more than any other terrorist attack. But it felt like the director needed to end the film in a blaze of glory, and close the loop. It was spectacular but a tad predictable while something less flashy could have been more meaningful. 'V for Vendetta' is never boring but it needlessly overplays the effects although it had everything to blow your mind, even the last speech by Natalie Portman gives you the perfect idea about the character, he's an idea precisely.And this is indeed an idea that prevailed, as the Guy Fawkes mask became the inspiration for the 'Anonymous' group, creating a case where fiction preceded reality, and underlined its own prophetic aspect. The film isn't flawless but it is a must see in our difficult times, and I'm glad I could finally review it 11 years after its release and 11 years before the time these events will happen, now in 2016, on the 5th of November.",8,21,32,5 November 2016
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," O Coen Brothers, Where Were You?...
","Praising a Coen brothers' movie because it has style is like praising an ice cream because it's cold, there's got to be more. 'O Brother Where Art Thou' has all the style a fan of the directing siblings can ask for, but a little more substance wouldn't have hurt the film.Talent is a double-edged sword, the more you prove yourself capable to surprise the viewers, to mesmerize them, to please their eyes and challenge their intellect, the more they expect from your next creation. And after 'Fargo', perhaps the most universally acclaimed Coen brothers' movie and 'The Big Lebowksy', a bizarre take on the noir genre whose brilliance sprung lately in our minds, came 'O Brother Where Art Thou'. Watching it, I want to ask the two Coens 'O Brothers, Where Were You?' A Coen brothers' comedy is an offer you can't refuse, but there are many ways to play comedy, goofy and borderline-parody like in 'Raising Arizona', surrealistic and over-the-top like in 'The Big Lebowsky', bleak and engrossing like in 'Barton Fink' and 'A Serious Man', or dark and atmospheric like in 'Fargo', even in the so-called dramatic movies, there was also a few scenes to channel their wicked twisted of humor. But as far as comedy is concerned, the case of 'O'Brother Where Art Thou' is puzzling, it obviously tries to play on the 'Raising Arizona' level with the atmosphere of 'Sullivan's Travels' in the background, but the humor never really manages to hit that special chord so that you can follow the story with the confidence that this is going to be one hell of a belly-laugh ride.And it's even more puzzling because the film actually got the casting right, the first shot with the three fugitives from a chain gang running and ducking in the midst of a cornfield is like borrowed from a 30's cartoon, it successfully sets the tone, something in the line of 'Of Mice and Men' and Tex Avery. George Clooney is a 'clowny' version of George crossed with a Clark Gable wannabe, his name is Everett, John Turturro is Pete, a sort of Lenny without the good heart, and Tim Blake Nelson is Delmar, a pint-sized Lenny without the strength, and none of Turturro or Nelson even tries to steal Clooney's thunder, which leaves him enough space to display his comical abilities. But there's not much given to him. For instance, there's one part where Pete asks Everett why he's the boss, Everett proposes a vote. Pete proposes himself so it all comes to Delmar, there's no time for him to come with a funny line, their first encounter: a black blind man driving a handcar on a railway.And this is only one of the many colorful tropes of the Great Depression era, a time, full of pastoral melancholy immortalized by so great classics, interestingly many road movies: 'The Grapes of Wrath', 'Bonnie and Clyde', 'Bound for Glory', a time made popular through bluegrass music, the sounds of banjo, sepia tones and so many visually appealing details that it's no wonder the Coen brothers decided to venture into this chapter of America and where else than Mississippi could they complete the picture with pies, long railroads, hobos in freighters, a governor who look like the KFC old man and Klan rallies? A Depression film is no depressing premise, not when it is tackled by the Coen brothers and cinematographer Roger Deakings. So what went wrong exactly? Well, the film is said to be adapted from Homer's Odyssey. While it gives the film a certain edge, it doesn't really add much to the story as the Coen brothers reckoned they didn't read the book, so why handicapping a great premise with a needless framework. Are the Coens so uninspired they couldn't make a story of their own? In fact they did, because nothing really evokes the Odyssey apart from the Sirens' encounter, Penny, the wife, played by Holly Hunter is obviously Penelope, with her knitting habit, but what do they add up besides simply 'reminding' of the Odyssey. Take the sirens part, what does that part offer except from the recognition that they are the Sirens? I believe the film would have been more interesting had they stuck to an original screenplay, with so many great characters, they could. But the film was just so busy loosely imitating a never-read book that it created a series of events, enjoyable in their own terms but so inconsistent that even the resolutions feels a bit artificial and unconvincing.At the end, we enjoy it for the stars, the atmosphere (some religious moments are haunting), the performances of John Goodman as Bible salesman and governor Charles Durning as Papy O'Daniel and naturally, the defining song of the film 'A Man of Constant Sorrow'. I would lie if I said the film wasn't enjoyable, every single department is well done but something is lacking in the whole. %aybe if it was made by other directors, we would have been less critical, the fact is the film was made after 'The Big Lebowksy' and it just didn't compare. Still, as a minor offering, 'Brother' is never as good as when it takes departure from the whole Odyssey's outline and its homage to 'Sullivan's Travels', a film I didn't even like in the first place. Maybe that's why I'm so critical?Nah it's precisely because I have been so admiring of most of the Coen brothers' works that I allow myself to say this one made me a viewer of constant sorrow.",6,3,4,9 September 2016
The Godfather," Simply the Greatest Movie Ever Made ...
","In the beginning, a young war hero tells his future wife, how his father helped a successful crooner in his career, by making his manager an offer he couldn't refuse : basically threatening him to death with a gun on his head. Through a true story, he was revealing a secret that showed how menacing is his family, and how different he is. At the end, not only did he threaten his brother in law, but he killed him, and when asked by his wife, if it was true, he answered: 'no', concluding one of the most fascinating characters' arcs in a movie. What happened in between is just the greatest cinematic metamorphosis, pure magic.This is not the story of a pure soul being corrupted, but the story of a soul whose only choice in order to protect someone dear was to become like him and therefore to realize that the crime that inhabited his father's life, not only could be justified, but ultimately, was the only destiny that could allow him to succeed. This is the irony of the American Dream, of a man who parodied the capitalism to underline its own limits, the same limits that ultimately built his power. An irony that inherited his youngest son, who lost his soul for the sake of blood loyalty: losing principles for the sake of mightier principles.The fact is that some principles transcend the conventional ones, and if the father didn't want to be a puppet, he had to be the one who pulls the strings, like Presidents who don't pull the trigger, to be the ones to declare the war. More than an iconic cinematic allegory, the strings symbolize the tight frontier between being a legitimate politician and a respected criminal, in other words, being Vito Corleone. Being the master who gives you protection, in exchange of loyalty, letting you act knowingly that everything is under control. That's the point, with Vito, everything is under control. When he promises that the two thugs who brutalized a poor undertaker's daughter will get their comeuppance, we know he'll do it. Now, the question asked in the beginning is : which of his three sons will succeed to this exceptional man?The answer relies on one scene. Michael kisses his father's hand, in danger in the hospital, and tells him respectfully: 'I'm with you, Pop' and a tear runs in Vito's face. His son is protecting him and for some reason, we're almost sure that his father will survive, just like with the undertaker. The only man who inspired the same level of confidence than Vito is his son, Michael, who's (ironically again) the civilian, the non criminal. Not because the other sons were not meant to be Dons, the older one was Sonny, hot headed, good hearted, the other was as good hearted but weaken minded, both were criminals in a way or another. Michael was the one because he had to be. More than a story of succession, it's a story of destiny.And 'The Godfather' is one of the greatest evolutions that ever enriched the silver screen. Mainly because of this story that everyone could relate to, one who loved his family and whose only choice was to corrupt his soul to protect it. It's not about crime, it's about the very necessities that make crime, not legitimate, but justifiable. It's not about crime; it's about its roots. It's not a crime or gangster movie, it's a movie where the crime setting highlights some principles like blood loyalty, friendship, or family that would have been meaningless in a more legitimate world. This is the thought provoking genius of 'The Godfather', that made it so universally appealing, because people from every cultures respect values like courage, loyalty, family, and respect itself.The nature of the story is just one of the pillars on which the greatness of 'The Godfather' has built its legend ... and I focused on this because the rest has not to be proved: the acting, the direction, the music, the quotes, the characters, the cinematography  every analyzable element is a living proof of the movie's closeness to perfection. Why should I develop this? If you read these lines, you know what I'm talking about, so let's keep this prudish and not try to be too enthusiastic. How ironic that the movie was based on a kind of pulp fiction novel  How ironic that the direction that made the movie with such confidence was so imperceptible  Indeed, Coppola makes us feel as part of this family, of the Corleones, they are criminals, yes, but the intimacy helps us to root for them  But another irony is that the direction is still present by these little details that gave the film its legendary feeling, every single death occurring has a little something that makes it memorable, from Khartoum's decapitation, to Sonny's ambush, from the restaurant to the baptism scenes, not to forget the two strangulations that opened and concluded the human deaths' series. The details are everywhere, in the script that enriched the cinematic language with so many iconic quotes, from delightful culinary parallels to other fishy metaphors  a script that transcended the novel, and made the film even more legendary.When it comes to defend 'The Godfather', I'm the most passionate fan you'll ever find, but I prefer to prevent this review from an overdose of superlatives. I know the movie is the greatest, not because it's my personal belief, but because I can't see another movie to top it, whatever cinematic category I use : story, acting, casting, writing, scoring, editing, direction  I can find a movie better in every element but not in all of them, and beyond all this technicality  it's just a movie that grows on you, after so many viewings, that shines cinematic respect in every single frame.
