Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Different, but amazing none the less....
","I went into this movie with a blank mind, trying not to think about all the negative reviews.  A kid's movie?  Oh puleeeeeease!  This has got to be the deepest episode in the Star Wars saga.  It was amazing.  The FX were far and away the best I've ever seen.  And they blended seamlessly in with the live action shots.  Darth Maul was mesmerizing.  All the actors gave good, solid performances.  Especially Liam Neeson.  Ewan McGregor did a lot better than I thought he would.  He captured the essence of Alec Guiness perfectly. Jake Loyd's performance was not 'wooden' as it had been speculated, he acted the way he was supposed to...... like a typical nine year old kid.  Natalie Portman did a fine job.  The acting was like it was in the original trilogy, but who cares?  The acting isn't what makes Star Wars great.  The movie went by very fast but left so many unanswered questions like, how was Anakin conceived?  What was his mother hiding?  Who is Darth Sideous?  All in all, this is an incredible achievement. And although it has a different feel than the other films, it fits in nicely.  Can't wait for Ep.2!",Null,0,0,24 May 1999
Back to the Future," I'll never get tired of this movie
","This is one of the few movies out there, that can be watched time and time again, and still thrill you like it did the first time you saw it.  Back to the Future is one of the best sci-fi/fantasy films ever made.  From the opening pan of the clocks, to the spectacular (even today) flying Delorean shot, this film is extremely involving and exciting. The script (even though dated by it's 80's dialog) is fantastic.  That, along with  Zemeckis' incredible, flawless direction (his best to date) keeps the film moving at a smooth and satisfying pace.  This ranks right up there with Star Wars as the best sci-fi experience ever.",10,2,3,21 March 1999
