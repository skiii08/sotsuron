Black Swan," great disappointment!
","Now after watching the film, i can't explain the positive feed-back, what's happening?! :( The movie is sadistic, confusing, boring, not convincing. The atmosphere was oppressive, i couldn't wait for it to end. The scenes do not justify Nina's exaggerated drama, her overwhelming sadness goes to far when nothing really happens. In fact, the story has no substance, no credibility. As for the good things, are there any? Portman's performance was not bad, i think, though she doesn't have an expressive face. A film that is NOT worth seeing! Don't be cheated by the good reviews. Really, how can they be so far from the truth?!",1,189,366,9 January 2011
