Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," EXCELLENT!!KUDOS TO GEORGE LUCAS!WAITING FOR EP2 & EP3!
","I LIKED Phantom Menace Ep1 of Star Wars Series A LOT.  It has been taken very well.  An EXCELLENT PREQUEL to ever-remembered Star Wars triology.The casting is PERFECT...costume, techniques, stunts, computer graphics are all VERY GOOD.  SPECIAL EFFECTS IS EXCELLENT.  The most important thing is the STORY IS GRIPPING from beginning to end. It is AN EXCELLENT MOVIE FOR ALL AGE-GROUPS.  A very good movie to remember for a long long time.  :-))",10,0,0,24 May 1999
