Resident Evil: Afterlife," Resident Evil in name only
","Needless to say, one of the worst movies I've seen (so far). When you see that the director is also the one who wrote the script you know it's gonna be really bad. The biggest disappointment is the plot (or the lack of it). Wikipedia calls it 'film adaptation based loosely on Capcom's survival horror video game series Resident Evil'. Loosely translated it means 'don't worry if you didn't play any of the games, you won't know the difference. Sucker.' Here are some of the most glaring plot holes: Wesker injected Alice with some drug that supposedly took away all of her powers, yet she survived the plane crash a few seconds later without a scratch and, after a few months, jumped off a building and killed zombies like nothing ever happened. Guess the drug works pretty slow... The Executioner Majini (big guy with equally big axe), originally from Africa, suddenly appears at the prison in Los Angeles? C'mon, that is just retarded. There's also zombies digging thorough the floor - were they bitten by radioactive gophers? The viral outbreak and a few characters is all this train wreck has in common with the name Resident Evil. A bunch of survivors huddled together in a building besieged by zombies? I'd take 'Dawn of the Dead' any day of the week over this travesty. Most acting was mediocre at best. Shawn Roberts tried and failed, simply by not being old enough, I expect better performance in the future. On a side note: They probably blew most of the CGI budget on Wesker's glowing eyes. What kind of a douche wears sunglasses inside? I guess that makes Wentworth Miller best actor. Well, he had the home turf advantage, playing Michael Scofield in Prison Break :-) We now come to the worst element ( element = :-), you'll get it), by which I mean Milla Jovovich. Would she have gotten the role if she wasn't the director's main squeeze? I doubt it very much. But then again, Paul W.S. Anderson must have seen her without any make-up and obviously thinks she's still presentable. That guy is a real trooper. The best thing she can do is butt out and leave acting to more talented and younger women. She and some other 'actresses' out there should get it once and for all time straight: no one wants to see a woman over thirty (a.k.a. soccer mom) wearing anything skin tight like spandex or leather!!!",1,0,2,31 December 2010
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," One of the worst movies I've seen, total trash.
","The last movie I saw, In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale, nearly made me comment on it, then I decided not to. But I'm not letting this one slide. Makes one really wonder how some 'directors' get the funding and presumably good actors and still manage to screw it up, whereas more talented newcomers create masterpieces with next to nothing. Seriously, the actors must be just in for the money. They can't need the money that badly, can they? Actors like these would most likely even sell their mothers if the price is right. But I'm digressing. This movie is bad in every regard, except maybe for the CGI. The humor of this movie is infantile at best, appealing only to toddlers, who also wrote the dialogs, as it would seem. The make-up for the elfs looks definitely like a mix of Stargate Wraith, Vampire, Zombie and possibly some other undead. Unfortunately, the only one warranting a mask isn't wearing any. Speaking of Selma Blair and her utterly pathetic acting - I find one scene particularly amusing, the one where she's acting like a schoolgirl on LSD while taking a pregnancy test. I think we all know that she is well beyond the age of showing such displays of exhilaration. In conclusion: avoid this piece of s**t at all costs, don't waste your time, money, sanity or even bandwidth. And don't buy the (hopefully never to be released) DVD to show it to your friends or family - unless you really, really, really hate their guts.",1,14,27,18 July 2008
Avatar," Simply don't watch it (means it's really, really bad).
","Well, as a lot of normal (1-star rating) users have pointed out, the whole movie feels like a trip on LSD - maybe visually stunning, but rather to be avoided. Throw in expressions like racism, white guilt, xenophobia and you're bound to hit something. Almost all reviews I read stated that the visuals were great. You know what they say - the prettiest flowers grow on a dung pile. We're almost in the year 2010, people! It's a GIVEN that a movie with this budget would have great CGI! And while not exactly standard, it's hardly something to write home about. How disappointing that so many moviegoers would be dazzled by this light show, like CGI is the only criteria that matters. Granted, the CGI artists did a great job, so what the hell did James Cameron do? After all, it's his name you'd associate with this disaster. It's one thing to steal ideas from other directors, but when Cameron has to steal from his old movies, you know it's gonna be bad. Acting, the little there was, was bad, corny, flat, whatever. Cameron didn't care, why should I. Also the many, many plot holes so big you could fly that red critter through. They didn't even bother to think of original (or at least appropriate) names. A mineral called Unobtanium? And what's with the misleading movie title 'Avatar'? Trying to lure in some unsuspecting WOW players? Don't want to get personal, but when you see users hand out positive reviews, some serious name-calling is in order. I really don't get how 'directors' like Cameron and Uwe Boll (yes, I'm now using both names in one sentence) get their funding. Maybe it's a scam, like in 'The Producers', where Cameron actually makes more money by creating a total flop. That's the only explanation. There's also Cameron's (as he might think well) disguised military/political critique. Personally, I don't give a rat's ass about what directors, actors or writers think about politics and much less the statements they make in public. They probably know as much about politics as I know about Terraforming. The world view Cameron tried to convey in his movie over a period of two and a half hours is not only naive, but utterly unrealistic. If there was a mineral worth 20.000.000 a pound, ANY company would not only relocate the natives living there, they would put them all into a giant meat grinder, just to see if their bones contained trace amounts of that mineral. Just think about it. Let's say there's a superior party that badly wants something that native inhabitants possess and won't part with. One group has a large war machinery behind it and combat training, the others have bows and arrows. Something's gotta give...",1,16,44,27 December 2009
