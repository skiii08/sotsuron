Minority Report," 'Minority Report' excels above all.
","Steven Spielberg is at his directorial best with this action, adventure. Tom Cruise is at his acting best as a futuristic cop on the run.  I was pleased to see one of the best directors team up with one of the best actors to make a brilliant movie.Tom Cruise plays John Anderton, the chief of the Pre-Crime unit of the Washington D.C. police department.  This unit stops murders before they happen, with the help of the 'Pre-Cogs.'  The 'Pre-Cogs' are three psychics who see the murders before they happen, and Cruise is the one who puts their visions together to predict the location, the killer, and the victim of the future crime. So far, the 'Pre-Cog' division has been successful, with its six-year span going on with no murder ever happening.  Things get complicated for the future of Pre-Crime when Detective Danny Witwer, played by Colin Farrell, is sent to inspect the operation.  Anderton is suspicious of him, because he starts to see cracks in the system.  When Anderton believes that the cracks are minor, he believes wrong.
Anderton sees another murder happening in the Pre-Cogs' visions and is shocked to see that he is the man committing the murder.  Now that he is on the run from his own men, which of course is under the command of Witwer, Anderton must unravel the mystery of why he has to murder a man whom he hasn't even met yet.  As time runs out, Anderton finds clues that there is a conspiracy behind it.  Can he figure them out in time, or will Pre-Crime see its first murder in six years?'Minority Report' is a movie with a fantastic storyline, one of the best I've ever heard of.  The actors are great, the directing is great, of course, it's Spielberg.  Even the effects are great, they are done with ILM. Roger Ebert says that this movie 'reminds us why we go to the movies in the first place,' and I agree with him.",10,114,161,30 November 2003
Troy," Troy triumphs as expected.
","I must say that despite the negative reviews I've read about this movie before I saw it, I was actually impressed by it.  Ever since I saw the first trailer to this movie, back when 'The Matrix Revolutions' was released, I was anticipating the release.  This movie, plus 'The Passion of the Christ' were two of the biggest movies I've anticipated watching for the 2004 movie season, and just like 'Passion,' I was satisfied with 'Troy.'
Brad Pitt, who is Achilles, starts the movie off with his swordplay, as well as his arrogance.  But that was the man Achilles was.  Pitt puts Achilles in a good perspective as to the man he was in the Greek ages.  Pitt also keeps the movie going into its climaxes and other points.But Pitt isn't quite the heart of the movie, Hector, played by Eric Bana, is.  He is a good man who loves his city of Troy, in which he holds the crown of the Prince of Troy.  He devotes his honor for Troy and his father Priam, played by the great Peter O'Toole.  Hector knew that there will be a time in which Troy would need his protection and honor, but it wouldn't have come so soon if it hadn't been for his brother Paris, played by Orlando Bloom.I must say that Bloom is a good actor, but I, along with many others who have seen this movie, don't like his character.  I understand that Paris was very naive and cowardly, but then again, I thought Orlando Bloom was right in playing a role in which he wasn't the brave man he portrayed in 'The Lord of the Rings' saga, and in 'Pirates of the Caribbean.'  But he isn't the main flaw of this movie.I have learned about Ancient Greek mythology way before seeing this movie, and I will only complain that most things in this film were completely inaccurate.  I'm not going to spoil things for everyone, but I will only say that if Homer were still alive, he would complain on how his poem, 'The Iliad,' would have only been half the inspiration for this film.  Because that's about how much 'Troy' had presented itself from the poem.But the inaccuracy isn't enough to label 'Troy' a bad movie, because it's not.  I still recommend this film to everybody.  If you have loved 'Gladiator,' this movie will be loved by you too.  As for Bana, I believe he should get an Oscar nomination for his performance as Hector.  Good job, Bana!Troy: 8/10",7,3,6,15 May 2004
