The Expendables 2," A Very good bad film
","The acting is more wooden than a tree house, the plot as believable as the fake moon landing theory and the action more over the top than the peak of Everest. Yet where else will you see the muscles from Brussels, the Terminator, Rambo, Chuck Norris and someone who wants to die hard.For those who loved eighties action films this is a 1985 cake transported in a time machine right into the 2012 and thrown directly into your face.By modern standards this film is bad, way bad, and during the action scenes you can almost the see the bad guys being re-spawned as truck load upon truck load get wiped out by Rocky and his side kicks. In today's post 9-11 such mindless violence might be considered insensitive. But throw in any call of duty game and you'll see it's just fulfilling a need that has moved from films to computer games and now with the Expendables 2 is right back on our screens.Here's hoping the third film will be just as bad as the first two!",7,3,5,28 October 2012
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," As mad as a vampire hatter
","Films can't get more high concept, and its about as serious as Gandhi the zombie Slayer or Nelson Mandela the werewolf catcher. But as bad as this film is, its saving grace is that the whole cast, including the director go at this film as if it was a bio-pic.The plot is ropy the characters are as three dimensional as a sheet of A4 paper, and the action scenes done a thousand times before. However the fact that this film hitches its plot on real events and the sheer guts of the cast to keep a straight face gives this film a strange charm. There is much to dislike but as a rainy Sunday afternoon film there is enough meat to entertain.",6,0,2,26 November 2012
Fury," Walking dead with Nazi Zombies
","The film has plenty of action and should be good watch for WWII buffs But it's the way the action was directed that let the film down. It seems the director never watched Saving Private Ryan, but had watched every episode of the walking dead. The film violence has cartoon like carnage about it, much more in line with a zombie film than a realistic war film. I felt like I was watching the walking dead.Due to this zombie violence there's just no sense of dread and the director never found the soul of the film, I found I never really cared what was going to happen to the characters.But the zombie violence was good enough to have kept me entertained, not a very good 'horrors of war film', but a good Nazi Zombie film. ( even through there are no Zombies).",6,2,7,28 November 2014
This Is the End," Love it or hate it - There is no half way when it comes to the end
","I normally don't like this kind of screwball LA fraternity humor and after the first 15 mins I was about to walk out. But when the end starts to come, I was surprised by the humor, the shocks and the originality. It's not like any other film I've seen, full of pop culture, gore, disgusting humor with a freshness that just kept me watching. I won't give too much away but where by design or accident the film also has a strong message and this gave the film the backbone to keep me interested to the end.. A really surprising fresh, effects laden toilet humor film that brings with it by accident a deep metaphysical message. But most of all it makes fun of it all and that what makes it great!!",8,3,9,21 September 2013
28 Weeks Later," A dark disturbing film that remains with you long after the end credits
","When I first saw the trailer for 28 weeks later, the overhead shots of apache gun ships and jets firing money shots disguised as missiles and bombs into London like a UK version of Independence Day didn't give me much hope for this film. My first reaction was oh no the studio and film makers have been infected by the greed virus and this is going to be a lowest common dominator film, made by a focus group who had just read how to make zombie films for dummies. However I couldn't be more wrong on just how good this film was and how little it sold out.If you expecting a no brains blood splattering zombie film with Arnie look a-likes firing rocket launchers from their sides in an endless spiral of blood, then avoid this film. Instead it paints a bleak and hopeless landscape, a far darker and broody brother to 28 days later, It is grim and desolate and it doesn't let up from the first scene to the last. It is more kinetic than the first film with less time for character development and more action. While 28 days later shows what it would be like to wake up in a world after the apocalypse. 28 weeks later puts you right into the middle of that hell and as a result the action and intensity is relentless. Saying this even with limited screen time the main characters remain solid with only the peripheral ones being slightly weak, but in no way does this spoil the films.All Zombie films fall into the realm of fantasy or quasi-believable; they take a sense of truth and reality and twist it. Zombie films in many ways are cousins to fantasy films and you'll get the most out of this film if you watch it with this frame of mind. 28 Weeks later was not designed to stand-up to scientific scrutiny, there are some plot developments that wouldn't stand-up in a court of law. But like all fantasy films this is not the point. The films makers were never trying to make a super realistic docu-style film. Even the rage virus itself was skipped over in the first film and the director and writer admitted that they themselves didn't know a whole lot about the origin of the virus. They were out to make a zombie film and a statement about modern life and where we maybe heading, which is what all the best zombie films do. 28 Weeks later has some truly terrifying and disturbing scenes. The action is brutal and packed with emotions; there is only one over the top scene, which seems like homage to other zombie films. But that is the only time this film looks into the past; it is not a rehash of 28 days later. It has a very different pace, but certainty comes from the same family with a high quality of production and direction.This is well directed quality film with more than a few shocks in it, definitely not a date movie, but a disturbing statement about modern times and is harder to watch that 28 days later. Like all films that ask uncomfortable question about the present, not everyone is ready to hear the answer and it will be a love or hate film as you can see from the reviews. But as time goes by this film will grow in stature and become a snap shot of the times, just like all great zombie films.",6,1,5,24 August 2008
Divergent," Detergent but still stinks
","Never since John Wayne played Genghis Khan have we seen a miscasting of the lead actor as bad as this. Shailene Woodley could just about make a believable Liberian, but she is biblically miscast in this role. The film comes across as a bad TV movie but overlong and is no doubt trying to cash in on hunger games.The plot is dreadful and has more holes that the albert hall, and those silly guns make NERF guns seem lethal. Also Why or why in all bad SF films do characters wear these one piece baby suits with a large belt. Surely in the future they will have more to base their fashion on than Star trek generations!",1,2,3,27 September 2014
Quantum of Solace," Edited together by a monkey on amphetamines.
","You might have considered it an inspired choice to hire a director of the calibre of Marc Forster, with real pedigree to his name. Films such as the emotional and touching Kite Runner showed that the Bond produces had hired no journey man or executive poodle; this was a director who cared about films. But if this film demonstrates nothing else it shows that directors of one genre no matter how good do not automatically translate to be good directors in other genres.The direction is truly dreadful; the manic almost random editing of scenes made me feel genuinely sick and gave me a headache for the rest of the evening. Put simply this director did not know how to direct. He had no idea how to create suspense and pace or develop a narrative the audience could follow. Instead we are left with fragmented plot lines, scenes jumping from one to the other so random that you feel that the cinema projector must had missed a reel.What Casino Royal did to revive Bond, Quantum in equal measure did to bury it again. Casino gave us a director, who understood the craft of action films, developing a kinetic post modern Bond seeping with class. Quantum is mess; it makes no sense and seems to have been edited together by a monkey on amphetamines. The worse bond ever, no question, no debate; Bond will need another resurrection after this film, but will it work twice?",1,7,10,20 March 2009
No Country for Old Men," A very special film
","This film pulls and teases at its audience ; At times it appears to be a linear heist / chase movie, turning into a serial killer film, to an instruction film on how to hide a suitcase full of money in a motel. As soon as you think you are comfortable with the story arch the film takes another twist always one step ahead never to be caught, not even at the end.This is a thought provoking film with some of the best dialogue I've seen for decades with perhaps one of the best villains in movie history. The films operates in netherland between reality and the inconceivable, sculpted flawlessly by the Coen brothers into something very special a world alien but familiar.This is definitely NOT a film made by pre screening and focus groups, it's all the more fresh and unique for never selling out. It goes against the Hollywood convention and doesn't give its audience what they want. In many ways this is a very brave film as with such an incredible performance by super bad guy Javier Bardem they could have made a much more commercial linear film in the editing suit but then again Javier would have never have agreed to be in the film if the Coen's pandered to commercialism. Instead it throws away the film map turns off the how to make a Hollywood movie script software and embarks on an uncomfortable reality not everyone is ready to see. Life doesn't tie up loose ends or always give us answers to perplexing questions nor do people always get what they deserve, I'm sure these elements of the film will frustrate those expecting a conventional script using linear plots.If you are Coen fan you will love this film and it will stand as one of their best. If you looking for a formula layered beginning middle and end script then this will disappoint. No country for old men is focused on the journey rather than the destination and what a journey!!!",10,3,6,29 August 2008
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," The Single worse Star Wars film ever made
","Expect everything you love and know about Star Wars to be trashed in this film. Imagine preparing the most extravagant meal with the most expensive and luxurious ingredients in the world. You spend days preparing the food, then as you plate up you pour two buckets of salt on top of everything. Your wonderful well made food ruined under a mountain of salt. This is exactly what the director did in the Last Jedi, he destroyed it. It was overlong, far too conscious of itself with crude plot twists and no love for the characters. It was as if an alien had landed on earth and never seen the other films and just made it in an afternoon. The words Last are very meaningful, it's the last time I will go to a Star Wars film, the Last time I will care about a star wars film and the last time any fan will have hope of seeing a film fans deserve. The Jedi are WELL AND TRULY DEAD!! Great work Disney!! Took some doing to destroy this franchise.",1,891,1352,21 December 2017
Flight," A terrible film that sends a dangerous message
","The film seems to be in as much denial as a raging alcoholic and its clearly trying to preach that drinking is bad. Yet the opening scene we have the Denzel Washington performing a flight maneuver the red baron would be proud of. The praise for his piloting skills comes up in the film as regular as an internet pop-up. Just so we never forget how good a pilot he is, even if drunk!But now here's the money shot he's a junkie and an alcoholic and he was higher than Ozzy Osbourne when saving the plane from crashing to the ground. But the message of the film is, drinking is bad, oh yes, drugs are worse because if you taking them while in control of a vehicle you might exhibited piloting skills Luke and Anakin Skywalker would be proud of. This is kind of strange message because I thought the reason drinking and taking drugs was made illegal while flying and driving is that it impairs your judgment and you are more likely to cause a crash. But in this film universe seems to be the other way round.Anyhow Denzel's character is bad for doing this, and the guilt for saving all those lives while higher than a space cadet is too much and he confesses. He then goes to jail but it's a Hollywood Jail where in fact he is happy now, since he confessed. What should have happen in the film is that his drinking and drugs caused the crashed and killed passengers. This is real life and the brutal reality of people in responsibility of vehicles or planes while intoxicated. But I guess this is not Hollywood enough.Did nobody in the film think it was weird logic? There's a terrible plane crash people die while a pilot is high on vodka and cocaine, yet the cause of the crash is 100% mechanical failure and it's the great piloting skill that prevents further death? This film sends a dangerous message, because it sends the message the only think Denzel's character did wrong was get caught. That his piloting skills were in no way impacted during the crash, this is a very bad message to send to young people. A very bad film.",1,35,67,10 March 2013
