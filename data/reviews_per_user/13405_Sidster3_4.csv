Casablanca," Casablanca - I've seen better
","Casablanca was released in 1942 and was directed by Michael Curtiz. Casablanca is known for being one of the best films of all time, but personally I found it very bland. The plot was good in theory, but the emotional connection and feeling was not there. I could not connect to the characters or their story. Rick, the main character was the most interesting out of the characters and I enjoyed watching his relationship with Captain Louis Renault more than any other part of the movie. Their relationship was the most dynamic and interesting part of the film. The cinematography of the film was decent enough. The cinematographer, Arthur Edeson, use of light and dark added to the films fluctuating mood and helped to portray it in an easy manner.",7,0,1,11 March 2015
Annie Hall," Ditzy and Neurotic Fall in Love
","Woody Allen shows what a masterful artist of directing, script writing, and acting he is in this romantic comedy drama. The script is honestly so funny, clever, and witty I could read it as a book over and over again. This movie is not for the dim witted as they wouldn't understand many of the jokes. You have to stay on your toes to keep up with this film, but you won't have any trouble paying attention with one joke rolling in after another. The cinematography and use of shadow in this film add to the artful and quirky feeling of the film, while also adding deep meaning to it through shadows. The plot portrays two unique and different people who are struggling to find their way in life and both completely over analyze they lives which makes for a funny comedy and drama about life, love, and being Jewish in NYC.",8,0,0,13 May 2015
The Graduate," Quirky, Confused, and Cute
","'The Graduate' (1967), was a surprisingly good film to watch, but I don't know why I was so surprised considering Dustin Hoffman is the lead. The music in this film was so unique and so perfect for each and every scene. The music led you into how to feel and then BAM hit you with the rest of it. Dustin Hoffman does an excellent job at portraying how confusing and overwhelming young adult life and graduating college can be. I honestly couldn't stand his parents though, but the actors who played them, William Daniels and Elizabeth Wilson did a fantastic job at playing the clueless, annoying, and embarrassing parents. The cinematography and the editing in this film were award winning in my opinion and the film is well worth the watch just to see the unique and artful use of the camera and editing techniques. The plot is new, fresh, and ground breaking so you won't get bored watching it, I know I didn't it.",8,0,0,13 May 2015
Singin' in the Rain," Had Me Singin' for Joy
","This movie is a classic and deserves all the credit it gets! I honestly could not believe what a wonderful film it was as I was watching it. The sets were mesmerizing and so beautiful. All of the colors were spectacular. I could honestly watch the movie without the sound just to see the dancing and the sets. That being said the singing was amazing and the lyrics were so thoughtful and funny. I've had this music stuck in my head since I watched it, but I love it. I could listen to the soundtrack of this film over and over again. The script was well written and the characters were believable and enjoyable to watch. I was honestly laughing throughout the whole film. It's the perfect film; a musical, a drama, a comedy, and a romance all wrapped into one. The casting for this film was perfect; Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor, Jean Hagen, and Debbie Reynolds were all funny, talented, and skilled actors who greatly added to this films success.",10,0,2,13 May 2015
