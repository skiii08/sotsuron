The Expendables 2," Long live The Expendables!
","Barney Ross, Toll Road, Hale Caesar, Gunner, Lee Christmas, Yin Yang and of course TRENCH are back for another round of explosively awesome, over-the-top entertainment you just have to love. This time around, The Expendables are sent into Eastern Europe to get information leading to tons of Cold War-era plutonium. The last thing they want is for this to get into the wrong hands. Towards that end, they recruit a young new Expendable, Billy the Kid (Hemsworth), a youthful veteran of the war in Afghanistan. As if the team wasn't powerful enough, when Church (Willis) assigned this mission to them, he also sent along the highly competent Maggie (Nan). But things get complicated when they run into super-evil baddie Villain (JCVD) and his equally nefarious sidekick Hector (Adkins). These two jerks are forcing an entire town to work in their plutonium mines. Without giving away any spoilers, let's just say something happens that causes The Expendables to want REVENGE! And these are some dudes (and Maggie) that you DO NOT want on your bad side. Expendables away! We were overjoyed to see the triumphant return of The Expendables. Thankfully, it was done right, which is rare for a sequel - but perhaps this isn't any ordinary sequel. The writers stuck to the formulas that worked from the first film - what we would call 'vehicles and oldies' (i.e. motorcycles, planes, trucks, etc. and songs such as Rare Earth's 'I Just Want To Celebrate' and The Rascals' 'It's A Beautiful Morning', among others) - but they smartly didn't just rest there and they made new improvements such as a young Expendable and a female Expendable. Plus, to the delight of the audience, everything is just BIGGER. Bigger guns, bigger explosions, bigger action setpieces, and a massive body count. Plus we get more Trench and Church than ever before. So it would be like a master pastry chef making one of his classic cakes, but adding more frosting. You can't hope for better in a sequel.While most missions into hostile territory shun violence unless it is absolutely necessary, what's so great about The Expendables is that they execute their missions with the maximum amount of violence. Just look at the opening raid (which both films have - but this new one is better. For example, their truck says 'Bad Attitude' and 'Shock and Awe' on it. So there). But this amount of ultra-violence would be a lot tougher to take if the film didn't have a healthy dose of humor. We said everything is bigger this time, and that includes the laughs. There are a lot of truly funny moments, and the men involved even mock themselves at certain points. It looked like everyone involved was having fun, and that sense is extremely infectious and winning. Van Damme surely relished being the baddie, which he rarely portrays. He was perfectly cast as the arrogant Eurotrash guy. And seeing Stallone and JCVD fight - on the big screen no less - was a treat. Most action movies have one good one-liner, if you're lucky. The Expendables 2 is chock full of them. And Stallone continues his streak of giving his characters great names - the 'kid' in the movie is 'Billy the Kid' and again without subtlety, the villain is named Villain. As far as Nan Yu's character, Maggie, we think Stallone might have gotten her confused with Maggie Q. Or possibly Maggie Cheung.Of course, the whole thing is a complete adolescent male fantasy blown up on the big screen. But that's the genius of The Expendables. It taps into the male brain in an extremely effective way. And there's absolutely nothing wrong with that. As an added bonus, the take-away message of the movie is that 'Violence DOES solve problems'. Which happens to be true, but is considered politically incorrect in today's wimpy climate. So the movie has guts, brains and heart, and has plenty of 'YES!' moments to boot. And the fact that The Expendables are getting REVENGE just sweetens the deal even more. Now that we've given the movie its due props, we have to mention two minor quibbles. The usage of CGI during some of the bullet hits makes it look like a video game at times, and some of the in-jokey humor goes too close to the irony edge for our liking. But it's all in good fun, and, taken as a whole, those small grievances pale into nothing. If the movie didn't deliver, those complaints would have more merit, but it does deliver, so, we're more than willing to let them go.It pretty much goes without saying at this point, but we LOVED The Expendables 2. We applaud everyone involved for doing 99% of everything right, and unquestionably delivering the goods that fans want. It's a proud moment for the cast, for the crew, and for America.

Kickboxer," Kickboxer is truly a video store classic!
","Eric Sloane (Alexio) is a champion kickboxer in the United States, so, seeking new triumphs in the ring, he travels to Thailand. With his brother/ringman Kurt by his side, he feels he cannot lose. That is, until he faces off against the most fearsome fighter in Thailand, if not the world: the dreaded Tong Po ('himself'...actually Qissi) Despite Kurt warning him to not get in the ring with him, Eric pridefully ignores his brother and fights Tong Po. The evil Po mercilessly beats Eric so badly he paralyzes him for life. Seeking revenge for his brother's crippling, Kurt sets out to learn Muay Thai and beat Tong Po in the ring. No school will accept him, so, working on a tip from ex-Special Forces Vietnam vet Winston (Anderson), Kurt goes to the Thai countryside to receive lessons from master Xian Chow (Chan). Chow puts him through his paces, but ends up falling in love with Mylee (Ashana) in the meantime. Gangster Freddy Li (Lee) has bet millions on the upcoming fight, AND Tong Po assaulted Mylee, AND he wants to get revenge, so with all the pressure building, will Kurt defeat Tong Po? Here's another Van Damme classic from the golden year of 1989. Most people, even if they're not action fans, are at least aware of Kickboxer. Even a David Letterman 'Top Ten List' of the day featured the topic 'top ten things overheard while waiting in line for Kickboxer'. Underground fighting movies had hit the mainstream and had their brief moment in the spotlight. And Van Damme was spearheading the trend, thereby becoming one of the faces of the action movie movement of the late 80's/early 90's. While Kickboxer falls squarely in the middle in terms of the quality of his Punchfighting era (the best being Bloodsport, 1988 and the weakest being The Quest, 1996 - as always it's open for debate but that's our opinion), it has a 'much imitated, never equaled' kind of feel to it and even though it's a little on the long side, it never really gets boring.It may be a bit of a stretch to believe Alexio and Van Damme are brothers, but, that aside, in the movie, Eric disregards Kurt's advice to not fight Tong Po, thus reinforcing the old saying 'always listen to your Van Damme'. But the brothers in Bangkok do share a genetic sense for fashion, as stonewashed denim vests and half-shirts seem to be the order of the day. But Van Damme steals the show in the wardrobe department when he unleashes what can only be described as a tanktop with suspenders for straps. And for no explained reason, for the final face-off with Tong Po, they are BOTH wearing silly loincloths that leave criminally little to the imagination. How did they both know wear a freakin' loincloth to this particular battle? Presumably they didn't talk beforehand and arrange it - it's surprising they both weren't embarrassed, like two women who wear the same outfit to a party.There are some excellent and picturesque Thai locations, there's a great song at every turn which smartly keeps the energy going (most of which are by AOR artist Stan Bush), and at one point one character says to Van Damme, 'I'm not signing your death warrant'. Seeing as the movie of that name came out the next year, could this line be an inspiration? Also in 1990 came a similarly-themed movie to Kickboxer, The King of the Kickboxers (1990), where Keith Cooke takes over the rural Thai trainer role. But one thing that movie does not have, nor any of the myriad 'training sequence' movies that followed in its wake has, is one very important element: the 'Van Damme' dance. Yes, part of Kurt's training is to go to a roadside cafe, get drunk, then bust a move with some local ladies. The movie pretty much stops - as it should - so we can see Van Damme get funky on the dance floor. Not since Breakin' (1984) where he claps along to the beat in his wrestling singlet have we seen his expertise with rhythm. Definitely a movie - nay - a career highlight for JCVD. He should have danced more in his movies.One other note: like how in Best of the Best 2 (1990), the name 'Brakus' is constantly and continuously said throughout the movie, here the name 'Tong Po' is the constantly-said name. These writers were sure proud of their bad-guy names. While the popularity of this movie led to the inevitable flood of sequels (where Sasha Mitchell replaces Van Damme), this original is truly a 'video store classic' and a worthy movie in its own right.",6,2,2,10 June 2013
The Expendables," The Ultimate Action Movie For The Fans!
","The Expendables is the most macho movie ever made. From the metallic-looking credits on down, the screen pretty much oozes testosterone.Barney Ross, Lee Christmas, Yin Yang, Toll Road, Hale Caesar, and Gunner Jensen (Stallone, Statham, Li, Couture, Crews, and Lundgren respectively) are an underground A-Team of sorts who go all over the world doing the hard jobs that no other teams of mercenaries will do. When it is discovered that evil South American dictator General Garza (Zayas) is a puppet for rogue CIA agent James Munroe (Roberts), the team are sent in to clean up the mess (i.e. create a bigger mess by creating countless deaths and explosions) by a mysterious man named Mr. Church (Willis).When Barney falls in love with the dictator's daughter Sandra (Giselle Itié) and she is kidnapped by the Munroe's goons The Brit (Daniels) and the very imposing Dan Paine (Austin)... get ready to party like it's 1986 as The Expendables hearkens back to the glory days of action cinema. Even Stallone's vehicles (car and plane) are reminiscent of the classic Cobra (1986), as are Garza's soldiers. Roberts plays the slimy Munroe with aplomb. He gets the classic final villain speech we all want to hear. Let's not forget our favorite governor Arnold: He is basically the comic relief with his jokey cameo and prerequisite funny name (Trench). It would have been fun to see Willis character to return one more time to angrily bellow 'This wasn't part of the deal!' or some line like that but sadly, that is not to be.We're so used to seeing these faces on the small screen, it was a real treat to see them in the theater. They truly deserve it. Eric Roberts, Dolph Lundgren and Gary Daniels in the same scene? Oh yeah! We also get to see a one-on-one fight between Dolph and Jet Li for the first time ever. And Gary Daniels vs. Jet Li and Statham. In the theater! The pairings of all the different fan-favorites is pretty mind-boggling. Of course, with an international cast such as this it becomes hard to understand what some of them are saying - when Stallone and Li talk it's hard to understand, and when Couture talks you don't want to understand. But to counteract his Dale 'Apollo' Cook-style delivery, we have Mickey Rourke on hand as the token 'good actor' who gets a heartfelt monologue. For a movie with so many characters, it was very well done how each got a nice backstory and it never got confusing at all.God bless Stallone - he couldn't have delivered this at a better time. What the world needs now is more tough, take-no-prisoners action. Not more sissy junk involving 'facebook'. This movie is the antidote to 'Eat Pray Love'. To quote The Simpsons, this is more like 'Beat Slay Shove'. Another good thing about the movie is it has no stupid kids or teenagers. When Jason Statham is the YOUNGEST person in the group, we get mature, professional action. Stallone is known for giving his characters funny names and here he really goes to town. You thought Driven's Joe 'The Hummer' Tanto was funny...He also includes another of his trademarks - ripped from the headlines topicality. Like the plot of Rambo III (1988) involving Afghanistan, here we have Somali pirates and a clear analogue to crimson-shirted cretin Hugo Chavez.If there is a downside to The Expendables, it is the use of CGI. CGI sucks and it takes away from the old-school feel we love. It's not entirely dependent on it, but when it was there, we felt it was unwelcome.Back in the golden age, any one of the cast members could have sold a movie. It is a sad comment on movies today that it took a ton of producers and EVERY major action star just to get the project off the ground. How can they top this if they want to do it again? It has all the clichés we know and love, just on a bigger scale. Abandoned warehouses, neck-snapping the villains, the line 'we've got company', exploding guard towers and many, many more. The first 20 lines said by our heroes (and throughout the film) are fun clichés and soundbites. This isn't a complaint. Perhaps a certain appreciation for action movies is needed to truly understand what's going on here. Anyone who trashes this movie simply doesn't get action movies or their significance. They should go back to poking Twi-hards on facebook, or some such moronic twaddle.Truly a movie for the fans, The Expendables delivers the goods with a once-in-a-lifetime cast. See it!

The Transporter," It delivers the action goods!
","Frank Martin (Statham) is an ex-Special Forces soldier who now lives alone in a picturesque region of France. When his friend Inspector Tarconi (Berleand) makes occasional visits to his fortress-like home, Martin maintains that he's left the fighting life behind him and now lives on his Army pension alone. The truth is that Martin is a master Martial Artist and expert driver who employs his prodigious skills for whoever pays his price, and whoever agrees to follow his strict set of rules. Things get complicated when a super-evil businessman known only as Wall Street (Schulze) hires Martin - and then Martin realizes that he's transporting a live human in a bag - a woman named Lai (Qi). Together, Martin and Lai uncover a smuggling ring and a conspiracy that will hit everyone very close to home. Battling many goons to get close to the truth, will Frank Martin be the TRANSPORTER of justice? Find out today!Top fan favorite Jason Statham in a movie co-written by Luc Besson and co-directed by Corey Yuen? Sign us up! Indeed, The Transporter lives up to the promise inherent in these names - it's a fast paced, professionally-shot, and totally enjoyable action outing that's easy to love. The French locations are beautiful and make a nice change of pace for the setting for an action movie, and the car chase and driving scenes are all the better for occurring in these locales. This was the first feature film for co-director Leterrier, and he and Yuen show they know how to deliver the action goods. Between the car action, the gun-shooting, missile-shooting, and Hong Kong-style Martial Arts, the movie breezes by in a blur of entertaining goodness. 
It's easy to see why this garnered two more sequels and a TV spin-off - it's a simple, enjoyable premise and the end result lives up to, and exceeds, audience expectations. While we wouldn't necessarily recommend the sequels, especially the second installment, what we would recommend is the Japanese DVD, if you can find it. It's an uncut version that contains more violence than other DVD issues to date. However, it's certainly not mandatory you find that in order to fully enjoy The Transporter - from action newbies to die-hard fans, it delivers the goods and surely a great time will be had by all who see it. Featuring a notable score by Stanley Clarke, and action scenes galore (the garage oil slick scene is a particular highlight), The Transporter is a gem.",8,0,0,24 July 2018
Driven," 'The street track is very dangerous!'
","'The street track is very dangerous!' In the dangerous world of drag racing, Jimmy Bly (Pardue) is an up and coming drag racer. He is always battling fellow racer Beau Brandenburg (Schweiger) to be number one. When Bly falls into a slump, Carl Henry (Reynolds) hires old salt Joe 'The Hummer' Tanto (Stallone) to mentor him. There is a lame romantic subplot involving Sophia Simone (Warren) and it causes more animosity with Beau and Bly.While this is not a straight to video release, it sure looks like one. For example when Tanto is racing, he runs over CGI quarters that look awful and it is hilarious. The racing sequences leave a lot to be desired and apes 'Days Of Thunder' (1990). There is pervasive product placement throughout the movie. It is basically a 2-hour commercial for Nextel and Target.com among many others.There are numerous dialogue scenes between Tanto and Beau which are nigh-unintelligible because Sly slurs his speech and Til has a heavy German accent.This nonsense was written by Stallone (including all the funny names) and a lot of plot items make no sense or are not fully thought through.I guess Carl has a past with Joe Tanto and he forces him to mentor Bly with the line: 'We go back, you and me. We go way back. You owe me Joe.'. We never know the past between them. There is the prerequisite scene where Bly gets in over his head and Tanto yells: 'You don't know who you are anymore!' The most annoying about the movie is that it is geared towards the ADD\ADHD generation. Every scene has lame rock music from the 3-CD collection 'The Edge' (not sold in stores!) 'Driven'? more like Drivel! For more insanity, please visit: comeuppancereviews.com",3,1,2,9 June 2010
