The Rock," It's exactly what the title says. THE ROCK rocks!
","My Take: Michael Bay is on the right track in this thrilling, violent and witty non-stop thrill-ride. First we had SPEED, about a mad bomber planting a bomb on a bus, which must speed through heavy traffic and jump gaps or it blows up. Then, it is followed by other action movies including DIE HARD: WITH A VENGEANCE, EXECUTIVE DECISION and BROKEN ARROW. And now, we have THE ROCK, which is the latest of these long line of 'Mad Bomber movies'. I bet you know what 'Mad Bomber movies' are. Those are the action films which concerns a mad bomber who plans to blow up a bomb until his demands are assured, and the hero/heroes, usually sent by the government, attempt to stop him. THE ROCK is just like that.Here's the setup, this time, our mad bomber is Brig. Gen. Francis Hummel, a well-decorated military officer for the Marines who also happens to be a Medal-of-Honor winner in Vietnam. So why does he want to do away with the country? Well, during the war, his men, who should have received honor, were abandoned without recognition. Now, Hummel demands $100 million to be given to each of the soldiers' families and threatens to launch a rocket containing biochemical weapons, while in the meantime, also holds hostages of tourists in Alcatraz. The government, who wouldn't want to risk too much with his demands, dispatches their own team to infiltrate The Rock, including Biochemicals expert Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage) and a former British spy-turned convict (the only man ever to escape Alcatraz alive) named John Mason (Sean Connery, bringing in a tougher tone from his heroic Bond hero performance).After an escape and car chase scene along San Francisco, which can be summed up as a deluxe version of the chase scene in BULLIT, which is bound to blow up once in a while. After this car chase, upon arriving at The Rock, we are served up with more action and stunt scenes including some wild shoot-outs, a mine car chase (ala INDIANA JONES & THE TEMPLE OF DOOM), near-misses and a climax involving jets and a green flame.THE ROCK is directed by Michael Bay and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and the late Don Simpson, which might suggest where the robust action scenes have come from. Bay, a director who fancies a lot of explosions (including excess), manages to keep every sequence a show-stopper. THE ROCK borrows bits from a lot of favorite action films, and that's why, I think, it's so good.Bay also directed Armageddon which was released then later, which was also an even louder picture than this. Although I did like that picture, I still liked THE ROCK better, since it wasn't only another loud action picture, but also a very good movie. The performances, especially by Connery and bad-guy Harris, are terrific. Cage offers his own charisma as in his other films including CON-AIR (also Bruckheimer/Simpson production). In the case of summer movies (series of films I really love to defend), THE ROCK delivers what it is intended, and a little extras.Rating: **** out of 5.",8,3,4,10 November 2007
National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Anyone for another round of Clue - American History edition?
","My Take: Goofy and implausible, but entertaining nonetheless.Imagine finding out that your great grandfather was a part of an infamous assassination of a famous American President, because some guy claims to have found long lost evidence to prove. Now imagine anyone would still give a damn about this and you got the whole plot of NATIONAL TREASURE: BOOK OF SECRETS. It's not very different from the original NATIONAL TREASURE, also silly, which wasn't really different from so many other quest/treasure hunt movies like INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE and Dan Brown's THE DA VINCI CODE and maybe, say, a puzzle book for kids. It's all pretty goofy, with a plot that doesn't just border on ludicrous, but just plain ridiculous. It uses centuries of American history as plot devices and twists. Goofy fun, but fun nonetheless.Like the original NATIONAL TREASURE, you should take it for what it is and it's actually a pretty good ride, but a bumpy one to be sure. Nicolas Cage, who still sports that goof hairdo from NEXT that makes Tom Hanks' mullet in THE DA VINCI CODE look 'in', is back as archeology know-all Ben Gates who is forced to search for more hidden treasure buried beneath American history just to clear out hi family name, dented by the possible fact that his great grandfather could be an accomplice in the Lincoln assassination. Once again, Gates and the gang, his girlfriend Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger) and buddy Riley (Justin Bartha), must decipher a series of hidden clues, use his history know-all to crack open the history-old secret. And I thought the ending for THE DA VINCI CODE was silly! So with all this case-cracking, riddle-solving or what not have to do with the titular Book of Secrets? Well, it's the book where all the government's secrets are written in and could possibly lead them closer to where 'X' marks the spot. It's really a McGuffin of course, which is just an excuse for Cage and co. to fool around in Buckingham Palace, The White House and eventually in Mt. Rushmore. Ridiculous really, but in this case I can forgive the overall ridiculousness of the piece and just went along for the ride. In the film is aided by a strong supporting cast, which includes Ed Harris as the mysterious baddie who uncovers the missing page of John Wilkes Booth's diary and John Voight and (what do ya' know!) Helen Mirren as Ben's parents. Cage is still in his goofy, over-the-top form, but the case of NATIONAL TREASURE movies, his performance just feels right at home with all the nonsense in display. So, yeah, NATIONAL TREASURE: BOOK OF SECRETS is a pretty silly movie, an empty-headed affair that requires you to suspend your disbelief as far as you can.

Angels & Demons," Fast and exciting. a slight improvement over THE DA VINCI CODE.
","My Take: While it's not as detailed as the novel, A&D maintains a fast pace and a thrilling build-up, improving upon its predecessor.I haven't read Dan Brown's THE DA VINCI CODE before seeing Ron Howard's movie adaptation, however I did read Brown's ANGELS & DEMONS prior to Howard's big-screen take on the 2nd (but in the chronology of the novels, the 1st) Robert Langdon saga. I managed to read halfway through before deciding to go see the movie and avoid being disappointed that it wouldn't be half as good as its source. And sure enough, the movie is not as detailed and complex as the novel, already abridging half the novel into its first hour. But that, I guess, is rightfully so. While it does leave a few interesting points dangling, ANGELS & DEMONS is a first-rate thrilling piece of entertainment. Whether or not it has a rushed narrative, the fast pace still keeps the story moving and the novel's necessary bits of excitement don't disappoint on screen.Tom Hanks is back, this time with a much nicer hairdo, as Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon, who is summoned by the Vatican Police when a crisis is currently being held in the Holy See during the election of a new Pope. My, have the tables turned! Even after 'exposing' the greatest Catholic cover-up in THE DA VINCI CODE, the Catholic church now runs to him for help. What irony! Anyway, the threat is the Illuminati, a sacrilegious society once devoted to proving that science, not religion, makes the world go round, resurrecting after hundreds of years to exact vengeance. They have already set an explosive device within its walls and is set to explode at midnight. That little McGuffin is the Antimatter, the exact opposite of our own matter, stolen from CERN in Geneva. Instead of being used as a superior power source at it is intended to be, it's now being used as a sort of bomb that will reduce the Holy See into rubble. Secondly, the four possible candidates for being the next Pope (the Preferiti) have been kidnapped and is set to be killed within four churches in Rome. Which ones? Only Prof. Langdon knows for sure, once again configuring a series of clues that will lead them to 'The Path of Illumination', the Illuminati's hideout, and the possible location of that precious antimatter. With a little help from the tenacious and inquisitive Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer of MUNICH), they accompany the Vatican Swiss Guard across the streets of Rome as Langdon's Mickey Mouse watch ticks urgently.I can smirk at a lot of things missing from the pages to film reels, but the film gives me very little time for that. Mr. Howard rightfully keeps the pace efficient and gripping, giving us little time to rest easy as even we feel the urgency of the hour. Though usually convicted of being miscast, Hanks makes a mostly apt Langdon (not so much of an action hero, but more of a thinker). Zurer seemingly lacks the greater spunk of the novels depiction of Vittoria, but still gives the role a fine spin. Although, it is quite a waste that the intimate relationship between Langdon and Vittoria are rarely given any depth. Ewen McGregor would have been a total miscast in the role of the Camerlengo, but he makes a dignified man-with-the-robe.With the expense of deeper character development and more detailed clarification of the events, A&D succeeds at being first-rate, fast-paced entertainment, something that Howard's previous Brown opus, THE DA VINCI CODE, sorrily missed. I liked THE DA VINCI CODE, but even I must agree that the thrills and excitement are burdened by some of its self-indulgence. ANGELS & DEMONS rightfully makes up for that.Rating: **** out of 5.",7,6,13,30 May 2009
Vertigo," Hitchcock's masterpiece.
","My Take: Still one of the most effective and engaging thrillers ever made. An obsessive work of art as only Hitchcock could make 'em. Misunderstood and unappreciated upon its release, VERTIGO is now one of the most celebrated and much talked-about film from the master Alfred Hitchcock. Not even Hitchcock himself could create such an entrancing film as VERTIGO ever again. It's an unqualified success from the man well-regarded as 'The Master of Suspense'. VERTIGO isn't just a great puzzling thriller, it's art. Like a painting by a sophisticated artist, you stare ponderously at VERTIGO and you'll always find something new and intriguing to talk about it. Although criticized for being miscast in the role, James Stewart gives one of his best and darkest performances as John 'Scottie' Ferguson, a former cop who had to quit the force due to his Acrophobia. In a chance of redemption, Scottie is contacted by an old college friend (Tom Helmore) to investigate on the strange behavior of his wife Madeline (Kim Novak). After this set-up, the movie takes a plunge into the deepest and darkest realm of Hitchcock pleasures. A knotty thriller and a romance with a twist, this is Hitchcock at his very best and most satisfying, but you may want to go back and see it again and again just to get the hang of things, but consider that one of the film's many pleasures. In a time where love is considered a powerful feeling, one that conquers all obstacles, Hitch also unveils the darker side of such heavenly feeling; love as a dangerous poison. One might say it's a case of Hitchcock baking his own cake and eating it, but it's more of letting out that skeleton in his closet; unveiling his innermost and deepest obsessions and raising it way up high for everyone to see. As a result, VERTIGO didn't do so well in it's day. But that just proves it: This movies way ahead of its own time. Had Hitch gone the wrong way, he might have lightened its tone and gave it a cheesy Hollywood ending. Had it been done that way, VERTIGO couldn't possibly be talked about as much today. After 30 years of absence, VERTIGO was re-released sometime in the 80's (along with other classics as THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH, THE TROUBLE WITH HARRY, ROPE and REAR WINDOW, now dubbed the 'Five Lost Hitchcocks') with restored footage and sound. On DVD, Hitchcock's classic is better than ever, with first-rate picture quality and sound. You'll swear the movie has not been made THAT long ago. The picture is clear, making the film look like its brand new, and the new soundtrack is breathtaking (Bernard Herrmann's score never sounded so great!). This is a perfect treatment to a one-of-a-kind masterpiece that's bound to entertain and be studied for generations to come. Rating: ***** out of 5.",10,6,10,11 October 2009
Alien 3," Decent stand-alone effort, but should not be in league with the 1st two.
","My Take: Despite the anti-climatic opening, it's somewhat effective, especially under the wing of Weaver's tormented Ripley. I am completely unbiased with ALIEN 3, the third chapter of one of the most ambitious of science-fiction sagas. I loved ALIEN enough to call it a classic. ALIENS *is* a classic, no doubt about it. Being a big fan of this series, I know I should hate ALIEN 3, arguably the weakest link of this series, and then again why shouldn't I? The film totally ruined the entire second movie with one brief opening sequence that totally betrays the ending of the first movie. The movie hasn't even started and already did it have an anti-climax. I hated this opening sequence (save Elliot Goldenthal's fine score), which is too bad, because everything that follows is rather good, that is, viewing it as a stand-alone feature. ALIEN 3 is no good compared to its superior predecessors, but even with its hated existence, the movie is not as bad as reported. In this chapter, picking up the last events from 'Aliens', Ripley crash lands in Fiorina 161, a high-complex correctional facility, maximum security and home to the universe's toughest crime-lords and rapists. Ripley wasn't the only thing surprising to the prisoners, there's a faster and more terrifying alien, built and ready to kill. But Ripley also discovers a terrifying realization, which she must stop herself.The film leaves some things unexplained. Like where did the alien egg come from, and how many are the eggs on the ship (if there's only one, what was the one attached on one of the passenger's face.). Worse still is how it's anti-climatic prologue gets into our nerves. But still, you have to admire the film's superiority and creativity. The suspense also builds up to terrifying and action-packed climax. The chase through those dark corridors are well shot and swiftly edited.Anyway, it's a decent underrated effort considering the fact that it's a sequel, but it still would totally sink if compared to the first two films. I think that if they could have bought a more decent writer (who won't kill the really good characters), it could have been better. Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",6,0,3,20 February 2007
Gremlins," A holiday movie favorite.
","My Take: A cult classic holiday comedy with wild knowing in-jokes and crazy special effects. I watched the sequel before watching this original. I like both films the same, one of the best horror/comedy films, and maybe one of the best film of all time. The story is memorable and director Joe Dante and Executive producer Steven Spielberg gives all their best to adapt Chris Colombus' offbeat and quirky script.Who would forget the early nights before Christmas, when young Billy Peltzer (Zach Galligan) receives the cute furball Gizmo as a present fro his dad (Hoyt Axton)? And who would also forget the bad results when the three very important rules (1. Don't Expose them to bright light 2. Don't get him wet 3. (Most importantly!!!) Don't feed them after midnight) are broken? And finally, who would forget the mischief and mayhem the night before Christmas, and the endless fun at every viewing?GREMLINS is that familiar movie that you couldn't help but love, even if some of its standards don't live up. Sure the special effects are long surpassed and so is the pacing, but GREMLINS is that classic in its own way that you'll just love it the way it is. Rating: **** out of 5.",8,1,3,27 April 2007
The Incredible Hulk," Not incredible, but rather enjoyable 'Hulk'.
","My Take: Flawed but modestly entertaining, and compared to the previous HULK opus, a little better.Among the others, I was disappointed by Ang Lee's HULK. I have no problem with a more character-driven superhero/comic book movie, but in the expense of deepening the character's persona, it lacks the good ol' comic book action fans have grown to love. Louis Leterrier's reboot/semi-sequel THE INCREDIBLE HULK makes up for that. It's still a flawed experience, with some scenes that still pad out the better bits, but in terms of pure big-screen comic book experience, it's an improvement, albeit not a vast one.In case you actually liked the Ang Lee version, Leterrier and writers Zak Penn (and Edward Norton, who made an uncredited re-write on his character) doesn't really forget the events of the first movie, but still makes sure everyone else keeps up with a new and different story. Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) is now in hiding, still in search for a cure for his 'sickness' with the help of an unseen contributor. Meanwhile, Gen. Ross (William Hurt) is still in search of our monster-transforming fugitive, this time with the help of a bloodthirsty assassin (Tim Roth) who is proves his more than a match for our hero (and we learn later, more than a match for the Hulk as well).Unlike Lee's artsy version, Leterrier isn't afraid to push through with the action for most of the time, even if his direction of the dramatic scenes are just as slow-moving as Lee's. The still-developing romance between Buce and Betty Ross (Liv Tyler) just doesn't spark. Norton, a fine actor who does a good job in deepening the character, just lacks the charisma of even a doomed comic book character, while Tyler just doesn't add anything to the role. Hurt and Roth actually add some actual depth to the proceedings. While it won't compare to the Iron Men and Dark Knights of the same year, Leterrier does deliver the 'Hulk Smash' fans expect, if very little else.Rating: *** out of 5.",6,2,2,22 January 2010
Mission: Impossible III," Accomplished!
","My Take: A vast improvement from its immediate predecessor and much closer to the espionage style of the original TV series. In the case of summer movie entertainment, MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE III (M:I:III) goes over the way, with special effects and action scenes abound. What more could you ask for in a summer movie? A little more substance could have helped, but it's no use crying over spilled milk. M:I:III is a nimble, action-packed follow-up worthy as a part of the now famous series adapted from the famous TV series. It's packed with all the sort of enjoyable moments. Whether it has Tom Cruise sliding down a building, dodging missiles or dangling on a cliffhanger, the film wants us to slide, dodge and dangle right along with them. Sequels are usually a bum rap, maybe because they simply rehash the elements of its predecessor/s, only striving to be bigger and louder. M:I:III is no exception, as it tries to top everything the first film and the second, and in the case of special effects, it might just succeed. While above-par from the second, it still lacks the sophistication and class of the original, which I really liked. But while not successfully topping the first film, M:I:III succeeds in revitalizing the franchise, thanks basically to director J.J. Abrams (of TV's ALIAS). He's exceptionally great at directing action scenes, as well as photography and rapid-fast yet stylish editing. But Abrams is also an expertise on character focus and adds style to the story. There are big sequences here, but they are never out-staged by the substance, or vice versa. Tom Cruise is back as Ethan Hunt, the famed IMF agent who finds himself in a heap of trouble when trying to save his fiancée (Michelle Monahan), who gets in the hands of evil arms dealer Owen Davian (slimy Phillip Seymour Hoffman), whom Hunt buries a grudge when his colleague (Keri Russel in a bit cameo role) is kidnapped and killed by Davian. Hunt re-teams with old amigo Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), including some new teammates, including a scene-stealing Maggie Q who gives a new meaning to the term 'tough cookie'. Co-stars are rather overshadowed by a much higher-profile actors as Cruise and Hoffman, who really steal the show in a terrific and heart-pounding Mano-a-Mano. Hoffman may be the best villain in the series so far. Tough, sly and cunning, he's the guy you'd want to get rid of, which is a always a plus to any big-screen villain. While it's a cut below the superior first film, M:I:III is a solid follow-up, and a worthy popcorn summer movie. The plot goes borderline implausible, almost as much as the unbelievable stunts. Purists of Bruce Gellar's famous TV series may think Hollywood has gone over-the-top in adapting the series on screen, but there's no denying of the thrills-to-the-max cunningness of this enjoyable summer movie. Check your brains at the door, and grab your seat as hard as you can. 1... 2... 3... Execute!Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",7,1,2,3 July 2008
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," THE PHANTOM MENACE, while not the best in the series, is terrific entertainment, with its heart on the right place.
","My Take: It's still everything I could possibly hope for in a STAR WARS movie, flaws aside. After a successful re-release of the original STAR WARS trilogy, George Lucas has finally released the first 'prequel' to his classic trilogy. STAR WARS EPISODE I: THE PHANTOM MENACE, the first of three 'prequels' to the original STAR WARS trilogy, was released in 1999, and instantly became one of the most talked about movie of that summer (it's also known to be The most anticipated movie of all-time since GONE WITH THE WIND perhaps) and also became the biggest hit of the 90's. One of the main attractions of course are the (expected) big-budgeted special effects, which are a breakthrough even for recent effects-laden hits like JURASSIC PARK and INDEPENDENCE DAY. The plot, which revolves around politics and government conspiracies disguised as Galactic annihilation, and characters were panned. True, the plot is sometimes confusing and the characters are a bit incomplete, but is this ever the strong point of the STAR WARS films? I think not. I for one put this criticism aside and enjoyed the film. Lucas has created a world here, and he fills every bit of it with startling discoveries and wildly imaginative visuals that will make you go 'wow'.Since it is (chronologically) the 'first' STAR WARS film, it gives us hints of the characters which will know later on in the following episodes. First we have a young Obi-Wan Kenobi, which will later be known as the wise Jedi Ben Kenobi, who is still a young apprentice to Liam Nesson's Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jin. There is also Anakin Skywalker, who would later be converted into the evil Darth Vader, who is just but a young boy with dreams of becoming a Jedi and a pilot. He is played by underrated Jake Lloyd, who may have slipped on some of his lines but has enough charm to play the young dreamer. Other characters who are introduced include Senator Palpatine, who would later become the evil Emperor, and those adorable droid duo R2-D2 and C3PO, which is but a bunch of bolts and wires. There was heavy criticism on the characters being pale and bare-bones. I think this criticism is overrated. We already know most of these characters, which will soon be more exercised and the later episodes. I think the point of THE PHANTOM MENACE is to introduce these characters. The characters are more like wine, the get better by age.An the plot? Well, it is convoluted and sometimes confusing, but I don't think the point of THE PHANTOM MENACE is not to create a political crisis version of a sci-fi epic. His point is to create some new things to give the audience a delight at the purchase of the movie ticket. Once again, Mr. Lucas succeeds in creating dazzling special effects, which aren't just terrific and innovative, it's also imaginative and wondrous. This are the best kind of special effects. You can create an explosion with many innovations on special effects, but if there isn't any imagination in it, it's worthless. The special effects in this film are innovative but imaginative. I liked that beautiful underwater villages, the terrific city towers of the planet Naboo, there is also the desert planet inhabited with various creatures. There is also an army of primitives fighting against an army of war machines created entirely of computerized images, not to mention the exciting pod race along rugged desert terrain. These dazzling and exciting visuals are a feast for the eyes, but they are also filled with awe and discovery.Granted, it is not as good as the original trilogy, but it really doesn't have to be to be a great film by its own account. Set aside the political talk and just let the visuals take you away from the limitations of a movie seat. I think it is a great film which is more enjoyable and entertaining to look at rather than to think about.Rating: ****1/2 out of 5.",9,1,4,7 January 2008
Raiders of the Lost Ark," The best adventure movie of all time. One of my favorite movies of all time.
","My Take: Definitely the very best adventure the movie business has to offer. The INDIANA JONES series may just be one of the best franchises in the history of cinema, and it seems pretty hard even to make a sequel that won't fall short of the predecessor. The INDIANA JONES series has everything that I like about the movies. Action, adventure, thrills, romance, and simply fun. And the first film, RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, is the best place to start. The great thing about RAIDERS is that it isn't content with one great scene. It's ready and willing to throw in as much beginnings and endings as far as it can. The film moves from one locale after another, giving the characters much more to do. To a lesser film that tries hard, it's overstaying ones welcome. To a great film with a great screenplay (written by Phil Kaufman and Lawrence Kasdan), its terrific entertainment.The film opens with our dashing hero, the ever-daring Dr. Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford at best), going on a trek through the rugged and muddy South American rain forest, off to find a priceless idol hidden inside temple ruins, surrounded by a bevy of booby traps. After surviving the ordeal and getting his loot, Indy's little artifact falls in the hands of his fortune-hungry foe Dr. Belloq (Paul Freeman), ending with Indy escaping a chase with Belloq's native allies through a plane, where Indy comes across his worst enemy: the pilot's pet python. 'I hat snakes!' bellows Indy, and who knew such an action hero would admit his fear. Makes me want to admit my complete despise of cockroaches.But this is just the first act, what follows include Indy's confrontation with Sherpas in the Alps, a trek that turns to a chase though Egyptian desert, but not without getting Indy trapped in a pit of snakes. The finale is always the time where the baddies get their just desserts, but that's just part of the charms of these kind of movies. It brings back the pure 'cheer for the heroes' entertainment. And since this movie is filled with very interesting and memorable characters, the experience is more relevant. The fun of Saturday-matinées are wonderfully relieved thanks to such expert handling by director Steven Spielberg and the breathtaking special effects work by George Lucas' ILM which still holds up pretty well.There's no further a do I can give about how great this film is. For all I know, you've seen it more times than I have (and I've seen it numerous times) and liked it as much as I did, if not more. Its worth buying the DVD set which includes the two films in the series, INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM and INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE, both still stand out as pure classic cinema. Comparisons (especially with the 2nd one) are overrated. One film in the series is just as good as the other. RAIDERS is the most original of the three, but the other sequels are less sequels, and sprout out much original ideas on their own.There's nothing really more I can say about this great films. My endless praises would just be the same thing that the last guy said about this movie. We know it's such a classic as other classics considered as the 'Great Movie-going Experience.' Like Lucas' other work on pure 'fun at the movies' fantasy STAR WARS, RAIDERS has earned its place in classic cinema.Rating: ***** out of 5.",10,0,1,9 May 2008
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," After countless years, E.T. can still bring that light close to our hearts.
","My Take: A classic family movie. Moving, tear-jerking and simply brilliant.(This is a review of the 2002 re-restored edition) Come on, admit it! It gets you every time. I would. You know what I am talking about, those scenes that still bring a small tear into our eyes and a cheer to our hearts. Whether it's the scene where E.T., who got sick, is desperately being cured by a couple of scientists who only want him alive for the (non-dying) sake of science, while the boy who becomes his friend only wants him alive because of their friendship. Or what about that scene near the end, the scene where little E.T., finally found his way back to his spaceship. As the lights flood from the doorway and the doors almost close, as E.T.'s earth-bound friends go teary-eyed, a dog walks into the ship's door, desperately wanting to go but can't. This, and perhaps many other scenes, is what makes E.T. the classic that it is. Re-released in a new restored version, it only makes E.T. more a classic that it is. The film adds many great things to the already great piece, but thankfully doesn't take anything else, at least not those that made it good.Being born in the 90's, the restored version of E.T. is the only way I this classic met my eyes back when I was a kid, even until now. But this 'new' version is still quite the film critics and public alike described. Maybe because the film's restorations, unlike the restorations George Lucas did to his STAR WARS trilogy, the 'changes' done here weren't major. Things like adding a new CGI E.T. in a few scenes were Carlo Rambaldi's puppet didn't look pretty convincing or digitally removing guns since Steven Spielberg felt it to be too intense for his vision are very small alterations to a brilliant film. Other than that, the sound and picture quality is cleaned-up for good measure, making it as good-as-new. In that way, it does the film some justice and at the same time, giving it a little makeover.But in the end, it's the story that still wins us over in this, or any other version. The power of E.T.'s adventure on earth with his friend Elliot (Henry Thomas) and his gang (not to mention Drew Barrymore's familiar performance as Elliot's charming sister Gertie). When the film was released at the Cannes Film Festival back then, it received a standing ovation. Or in simple screenings in the theater alone, E.T. has the power to grab our hearts and mellow it until our eyes shed a tear. Be it joy or sympathy, this is a movie with big emotions. We care about the characters and what happens to them. Is it no wonder those scenes in this film still has the power to grab the audience and let them go with tears and cheers. E.T. is still one of the finest piece of family entertainment, perhaps one of the best films ever made. Okay, that maybe an overstatement, but could you disagree?

One Hundred and One Dalmatians," Spot-on brilliant.
","My Take: An irresistible Disney classic. It's probably a bit strange to say this 1961 Disney animated movie as one of their best animate films in the Golden Age of the studio. Still, I ask no apologies. 101 DALMATIANS is a sweet, clever and splendidly entertaining animated adventure and, in my opinion, one of the very best films in their classic era. But lets face it! Although I took a fonding of Disney's classic animated films, some of them (PETER PAN comes to mind) are extremely overrated. So far as I've seen, only FANTASIA lives up to the term 'classic', but then again, I haven't seen them all. But even if I did, I'll always have a space in my list of favorites for 101 DALMATIANS. Not only do I find it one of the very best Disney films, it's also on of the very best talking animal fables ever to hit your theaters.One of the aspects of the film is its villain. With the exception the Evil Stepmother and Maleficent, DALMATIANS' Cruella DeVille (voiced by Betty Lou Gerson) is an outrageous and colorfully written villain, and yes, the mention of her name brings in wonderful memories. But, although Cruella is one of the finest aspects of the film, there are other pleasures to behold. Mainly, the clever portrayal of its talking animals. With clever voice acting but mostly due to much more clever writing, the animal characters here don't just talk for our fondness, they talk with precise and clever speeches. The animal characters are far more intelligent and colorful than its human counterparts, but I guess that's what they meant to do. In fact, sometimes throughout the film, I can almost see a sort of human personality among all of the animals, be it cats, dogs or the dalmatians, one and all.The animation has its flaws, and the energy level drops at a rather low point midway, but the film never failed to cheer me up. Colorful characters, beloved animation and no lack of energy help make this little Disney film a big delight. Now, if your still looking for an apology when I say 101 DALMATIANS is one of the best Disney movies ever, your probably better of not reading this review in the first place. I make no apologies about it, 101 DALMATIANS is terrific, if not flawless, entertainment. Bundle up the kids! Rating: ****1/2 out of 5.",9,2,2,18 October 2008
Minority Report," Summer sci-fi attraction... with a brain.
","My Take: Another instant Spielberg thrill-a-minute classic is born. How does Steven Spielberg do it? He creates one motion picture blockbuster after another, each one one of the best ones there are. Either it's a JURASSIC PARK or an E.T., or it's a next Best Picture Oscar contender as SHINDLER'S LIST, Spielberg is one hit-maker that doesn't seem to run out of gas. MINORITY REPORT is 2002's latest model, it's also one of Spielberg's finest. Not only is it an expensive summer attraction, MINORITY REPORT is also a clever, inventive ideal sci-fi movie with neat plot twists, intelligent plotting and some very inventive imaginations-come-to-life. This is more than just another special effects extravaganza that let your eyes feast upon. This time, your brain can enjoy it too.Spielberg's view of the future isn't just a video game-inspired metropolis with nothing much happening but a lot of running and chasing. This one actually grows a plot and a brain. Taking place in 2054, the futuristic Washington D.C. lessens from crime and injustice thanks to an advanced system called 'Pre-crime', an advanced computer system which makes use of Pre-cogs, three genetically altered humans who identify criminals before they commit their crimes. Futuristic cop John Anderton (Tom Cruise, out for another mission impossible) is one of the 'Pre-crime' cops, but when he himself is framed for committing a murder (using his long grudge for the loss of his son), the tables have been turned, making Anderton the latest target of the perfect system he helped put up.Visually, MINORITY REPORT is a blast of visual achievements. Special effects created by Industrial Light & Magic matched with Alex McDowell's imaginative production design provide a terrific amount of imaginative craftsmanship. The special effects here show how far we have come when it comes to effects craftsmanship, as well as how far our imaginations have advanced. But the movie isn't all special effects and flash, MINORITY REPORT is also a brilliantly plotted mystery thriller which delivers both the mystery and the thrills. The plot, based on Phillip K. Dick's story, is impressively put on screen without showing the little sense of stupidity. Spielberg doesn't dumb it down for the sake of special effects. He values the plot, characters and suspense as much, if not more, than the expensive effects and sets. This is sheer proof that Spielberg still knows the Hollywood film-making enterprise, and MINORITY REPORT is still one of his best contributions to the genre.Rating: ***** out of 5.",10,0,1,28 May 2008
Mulan," One of the best animated movies ever. A 'Best Picture' movie epic made as an animated feature.
","My Take: Yet another Disney classic. Impressively animated and beautifully told. Epics have always been one of Hollywood's most regular films during the golden age of film making. Epics are done in very high budgets, and at the time, one of the most astonishing. Another powerful Hollywood genre, is animation. It was powerful as well, that it earned an award slot in the Academy Awards ('Best Animated Feature').What's great about 'Mulan' is that it combines these to staples in Hollywood in one very satisfying movie. The film is based, as I've heard, on a poem about a typical village girl who, in favor of his father, joins the Imperial army on resent against the invading Huns. Disgused as a man named Ping, Mulan sets on an incredible journey, and finds herself changing the course of history forever. This movie interests me for the fact that it is done in great skill, as if the producers were making a live-action epic. The films moments of war matches the very moments of those on big-screen live-action epics. The score by Jerry Goldsmith, one of my favorite composers of all time, gives his best by providing the music, and of course it was great. But when Goldsmith scored this, he wasn't focusing on an animated movie score, but as if he was scoring, perhaps, a David Lean epic. 'Mulan' has always been one of my favorite animated movies. Perhaps, it may just be one of the best animated movies ever. A 'Best Picture' movie epic made as an animated feature. If David Lean were to make an epic and threw in some first-rate musical numbers in, it would have been somewhere akin to MULAN. Rating: ***** out of 5.",10,2,2,7 June 2007
Star Trek," Beam me up Scotty! I'm ready to be a Star Trek fan.
","My Take: This new STAR TREK is bound to recapture the hearts of its fans, while also being accessible to a wider audience.I usually go see movies in theaters when it's worth it. As much as possible, I really don't want to see a movie I can see for free on television. If I only get to go in theaters this year, I'm glad, thus far, that among them is STAR TREK. It's one of the biggest and, in my opinion, one of the very best movies of the summer so far. If this is the only movie I see this summer, I still wouldn't feel so swindled.Let me start by pointing out that I'm not a Trekkie (Trekker?), but I did see enough Star Trek movies, even loved a few (STAR TREK III and IV so far), to familiarize me enough with these characters. Other than that, my loyalties to this are extremely limited. But it turns out, I could buy a ticket and not know anything about STAR TREK, and I still will come out having a grand time at the movies. I always thought STAR TREK as a film franchise, whilst not exactly strong blockbuster contenders, have mostly been interesting on the big screen, alternating spaced-out action sequences with space opera and Shakespearean villains, but this new STAR TREK is probably the best so far, particularly because the film opens its doors to other than its fans. Trek fans may reunite, but everyone will still have enough fun with STAR TREK. I sure did! The movie serves as both a prequel as well as a reboot to the screen franchise, while it's also a great way for fans to catch up with the dangling threads left behind by their beloved characters. The movie opens with the introduction of George Kirk, the first officer of the federation ship The Kelvin, who takes command of the vessel when it's attacked by Romulans, led by the vengeful Captain Nero (the scenery-chewing Eric Bana). He's, of course, none other than the father of the then-famous James Tiberius Kirk. Forward 22 years later, grows up into a rebellious youth (Chris Pine), wasting the good name of the father he never really knew. But during a brawl in a bar, he is inspired by a Captain Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood) to enlist in the Starfleet Academy. It's so nice to see everyone's favorite characters refreshingly enjoyable again. Though it's a stretch, it's nice to see Kirk as a sort of rebel without a cause and Nyota Uhura (then played by Nichelle Nichols) as a sexy, miniskirt-clad Zoe Saldana. It's also nice to see 'Doc Bones' McCoy (Karl Urban), Hikaru Zulu (John Cho), Chekov (Anton Yelchin) and especially Montgomery 'Scotty' Scott (who else but Simon Pegg) in their younger forms after (or is that before? Never mind) their shoes were worn by the late DeForrest Kelley, George Takei, Walter Koenig and James Doohan. But perhaps the most delightful is Zachary Quinto's impression of Mr. Spock, baring both a sort of uncanny resemblance and impersonation. When he does an impression of Spock's trademark eyebrow raise, I cheered.One of the main reasons I liked the original STAR TREK movies is the camaraderie and quirky relationship between these characters. These characters probably wouldn't be nearly as effective as individual folk, but are always so good together. Seeing them, as if for the first time, on J.J. Abrams new STAR TREK is having that very same feeling Michael J. Fox' character in BACK TO THE FUTURE felt upon seeing his parents as teenagers. It's nice to see these characters we know and love, yet being acquainted with them in a different way. For anyone looking for a more contemporary comparison, Batman fans felt the same feeling when they saw BATMAN BEGINS and later, THE DARK KNIGHT.The plot is a stretch to be sure, taking place in the past while creating a sort of alternate reality that changes the outcome of the future events portrayed in the previous movies, but in such an event, plot contrivances don't matter as long as the plot can carry the film's 126 minutes and is able to reintroduce us to these characters we have known and loved. There's even a cameo/bit role by Leonard Nimoy, reminding us of the things of the past (or is that the future? Whatever). But fan you may be or not, STAR TREK is a fast, highly entertaining and exciting blockbuster with some genuine excitement and a few great laughs along the way. This 'Trek' is a nostalgia trip at warp speed that's bound to live long and prosper in all of us for years to come.Rating: ***** out of 5.",9,4,14,11 May 2009
Iron Man 2," What a summer blockbuster sequel should be!
","Big expectations from the original are hard to live up to, which just seems unfair to this reasonably enjoyable and exciting sequel. Going over that age-old Hollywood mantra that 'bigger is better', this sequel throws in bigger set-pieces, better special effects and a superb cast. But unlike most sequels to successful hits, IRON MAN 2 is not only big in terms of special effects and action set-pieces, it also has stronger characters (perhaps the only real problem with that is that they're too many of them) and an even stronger plot.As with the other people who enjoyed the first IRON MAN movie, my hopes were high for the sequel. As in other superb comic-book movie sequels like SPIDER-MAN 2 and THE DARK KNIGHT, the storyline frees itself from the exposition settled in the first movie and are now able to take the story into a different direction for the sequel. Following the end of the first movie, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) has already admitted his identity as Iron Man and, as he puts it, 'successfully privatized world peace'. Arrogant as he is, he gets the job done, but saving the world is only half the battle. Stark also has a demanding Senator Stern (Gary Shandling) on his back who wants his Iron Man technology surrendered to the military, a similarly egotistic rival (Sam Rockwell) who wants Stark and his crowning achievement be reduced to yesterday's news, and of course there's vengeful Russian physicist Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) bent on killing Stark to avenge his father. Only to make matters worse, the arc reactor that's keeping Stark alive is slowly poisoning his blood, and would kill him if he doesn't find a substitute to the reactor's Palladium content.There are enough characters here that could have made this as an early reunion for The Avengers, with a powerhouse of a cast to boot. In addition to the return of Downey's egotistic Stark and Gwyneth Paltrow's delightful portrayal as long-suffering assistant-turned-CEO Pepper Potts, there's also Scarlett Johansson's Natasha Romanoff aka Black Widow (Scarlett Johnasson in a black leather suit and sporting red hair! 'Nuff said), Samuel L. Jackson's return as Nick Fury (after a very brief cameo in the first), Don Cheadle replacing Terence Howard as Lt. Col. 'Rhodey' Rhodes (who finally gets his 'next time' opportunity as he dons the suit as the battle-ready War Machine), and even Favreau's Happy Hogan (nothing more than an extended cameo in the first film) gets more screen time. On the bag guy side is Rourke's disgruntled Vanko, Rockwell playing another character we would love to hate, and Shandling's hilarious portrayal of a greedy politician. Too many of these characters could have repeated the misstep that SPIDER-MAN 3 had done; too many characters with too many subplots that ruin the flow of the story. But director Jon Favreau and writer Justin Theroux avoid this pitfall by just giving our characters enough screen time that they deserve and only throwing in subplots that actually move the story along.IRON MAN 2 is what a summer blockbuster sequel should be; it throws in everything we expect from its superb predecessor and giving is a little more without being something akin to an overstuffed, overcooked turkey. The action sequences are great in the first movie, and they're even bigger here. It even has a better, more thrilling climax than the one in he first, and more interesting and even outrageous villains than in the original. As usual, Downey Jr. is still one of the chief delights with his portrayal of a different kind of comic-book hero. Throw in a cast that looks absolutely perfect and every thrilling action set-piece in place and you have a sequel that's actually worth the wait.Rating: **** out of 5.",8,13,25,9 May 2010
Alien: Resurrection," The brainless, violent monster movie that it is.
","My Take: While not the best in the ALIEN saga, this fourth chapter brings along action-packed thrills fans found lacking in ALIEN 3. (This is an extension of the review I wrote in February 2007)Fans consider ALIEN: RESURRECTION as a remedy after the doom-filled and much-maligned ALIEN 3. After all, after much of the pulp has already been juiced, it's only appropriate that this fourth ALIEN film declines to a mindless monster movie of the summer. Under those warrants, ALIEN: RESURRECTION gives you your end of the bargain. 'Alien: Resurrection' is a good film. Lets not say excellent, but still a very good entry in the series. Sure, it does some things that should have ended in the previous chapter, but still makes up for it. The Ripley here is a clone, bred by scientists who plot to exploit and study the alien creatures. Okay, the film doesn't explain how they got Ripley, or the alien queen inside her (she supposedly burned in boiling lava in the previous chapter). But hey, those are somethings only sci-fi can answer. Anyway, the main attractions are those mean green mothers from outer space, slimier than ever. And then there's Weaver, returning to her competent, female Rambo, able to widen her characteristics when given the chance to make Ripley (or clone Ripley) a meaner and more complicated critter. Overall, not the series' best, but it's definitely the best movie gross-out carnage and slimy monsters has got to offer. Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",7,1,1,20 February 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Kraken liken'.
","My Take: Bigger and better than the first. A terrific adventure. It's been an unbreakable rule amongst Hollywood blockbusters that a sequel, although trying to be better than their predecessors, are never really better, something always falls short of its predecessor. Although some sequels have eventually broken that law, it's pretty rare for another sequel that actually is better than the original. PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: DEAD MAN'S CHEST breaks that law once more, as it is bigger and surprisingly better than its predecessor, the immensely popular PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL. The budget is eventually bigger, much for inserting bigger and better effects than the original. Not only does it feature a lot of pirates, this one has slimy creatures and a giant Kraken. But even with it's over-commercialization, PIRATES 2 lives up to it's hype.Personally, the original PIRATES wasn't exactly the best summer movie in years, but it was an unprecedented summer entertainment and it's quite an offer I couldn't refuse. I enjoyed the special effects and action scenes, and then there's Johnny Depp's portrayal as the half-sane pirate Captain Jack Sparrow which provides the film's best charms. This sequel offers practically the same formula, only with new refinements as it is a sequel to a certified blockbuster hit. The special effects are bigger, the action is more abundant and of course, the running time is extended. While the original film was long enough, this sequel is twice as actually long, running at 150 minutes. Nobody wants to stay too long in a packed movie theater for that long, which is probably the films heavy flaws. The film is far too long, with some parts that often lag. The film could cut at least 1 hour without losing much than a large dosage of special effects that could be included as an extra feature on DVD.Still, while it is even longer than the original, this sequel is actually better and it has more action and thrills than its predecessor. It's definitely longer than the previous film, but this one manages to escape the sequel curse of being but a xerox copy o the first film. This one has a new plot, concerning Capt. Sparrow's life debt with the gruesome undead pirate Davy Jones (Bill Nighy, with a CGI octopus-altered face). The lovable characters of Capt. Sparrow, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Kiera Knightley) are back and with their much development and chemistry from the first film, there's no complaining about 'no character development'. The special effects and photography are superb as they should be. Director Gore Verbinski has a lot of fun with his accomplishments on effects, but still manages to accomplish a product that delivers far more appeal that that those of CGI.A highly recommendable summer attraction. Much more like a theme park ride than a movie, but at that way, it's still terrific entertainment.Rating: ****1/2 out of 5.",9,0,1,2 June 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Depp and Rush play 'Pirates'.
","My Take: A charismatic and hilarious performance by Johnny Depp is the icing of the cake in this terrific, if somewhat overrated, summer flick.After all the talks, the publicity and all else in its hype, PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN premiered in theaters during its release date with a bang. This is a summer movie with a hype that reaches the moon, but this one actually lives up to it. PIRATES is very long, too long in fact even for a big-budget event film, but for half of its running time, PIRATES is a good ride.Special effects and action scenes galore, the real treat is Johnny Depp, delightful as the drunkenly quire Captain Jack Sparrow, a pirate who lost his ship, the Black Pearl, to another captain (Geoffrey Rush), who is also curse with eternal damnation when they are damned to walk the earth as undead seafarers. After the crew of the Black Pearl invade the peaceful town of Port Royale and kidnaps the Governor's Daughter Elizabeth Swann (Kiera Knightley), childhood friend Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) aids the help of Sparrow to find her and get her back. Swashbuckling action and a lot of special effects ensues.In fact, so much of these action and effects occupy the entire picture, yet the film does what every summer movie does: more. So much more of the stuff that already is plenty in this film gives us too much of the bargain. Special effects after special effects do get tedious after a while. Still, for a summer movie, PIRATES kept its promise, and, here's the question: Did it live up to the hype? Sure it did. Although imperfect, legions of fans will not be disappointed.

"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," C.S. Lewis will be proud.
","My Take: Terrific special effects and magical storytelling make for one sweeping adventure.THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE LION THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE is the first adaptation of C.S. Lewis classic fantasy adventure in many years, and it's also the latest in the long line of big-budget fantasy epics, following the success of the HARRY POTTER and LORD OF THE RINGS series, both adapted from novels. NARNIA is not the best entry in this new cinematic debacle, but both the money's worth and the cost is there. I loved it, special effects and all. The movie (directed by another New Zealand-born Andrew Adamson from the SHREK films) is filled with all the wonders of special effects, the best that Hollywood has got to offer (until the next one), but the film isn't just about special effects, even if they're great. The characters and plot finely holds up. I, who enjoyed Lewis' works on the Narnia book series, enjoyed this film version, and I'm pretty sure Lewis would have been proud by this treatment.When I was a kid, I used to wait for a stage play of this story which came out every Holiday season. When I got a little older, and the show stopped coming up, I moved to reading the book. I've read two novels in the 'Chronicles of Narnia', 'The Magician's Nephew' and this one. So, when the big-screen version is announced, I was anticipated with the news, and got up to see it quickly. The movie version is not like the musical play I saw as a kid, but comparisons aren't required. This is a fantastic adaptation that does Lewis some justice. The characters, CGI or not, from the book aren't dumb down and remain very interesting. And played by a young British cast makes them very appealing to the big-screen.For those unaware of the story, four orphans, Peter (William Moseley), Susan (Annie Popplewell), Edmund (Skandar Kaynes) and Lucy (Georgie Henley) are whisked to the magical world of the title, where they encountered that it has been cursed with eternal winter by the evil yet appealing White Witch (played with real malice by Tilda Swinton). The only hope is to fulfill a prophecy held at the beginning of time, with the help of the valiant lion king Aslan (voiced by Liam Neeson).The special effects are first-rate. The make-up and visual effects created by the Academy-award winning crew behind THE LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy are just as believable as their previous Award-winning work. For a long time, the CGI lion is almost real. But besides the effects, the adaptation is wonderfully faithful. All the very appealing characters and patriotic sequences, as well as those dark ones, are very well lift from the pages of Lewis' books.Very well done, and magical. It's highly recommended with a **** (out of the usual 5).Rating: **** out of 5.",8,1,2,12 May 2008
Elizabeth," ELIZABETH reigns high.
","My Take: Less a biopic and more of a daring GODFATHER-styled story elevated by Cate Blanchett's unforgettable performance.The year: 1554. Faith has been divided into two: Christianity and Protestant. The zealous Queen Mary of Scots rules England, but has no heir to take over her reign, since she bares no son. The only one next in line for the throne is her sister, Elizabeth, a protestant. When she fails the attempt to execute her for treason, Mary closely falls to her deathbed, and Elizabeth, closer to sit in her throne and rule over England. All these and later events are portrayed perfectly in ELIZABETH, a bold, daring and visually stunning excursion into a dark realm of history and the life of the known Virgin Queen.Firstly, the stunning look of ELIZABETH is clearly worth mentioning. The sets and especially the costumes by Alexander Byrne are spectacular. Credit also goes to director Shekhar Kapur. A brilliant visionary, Kapur fills the screen with inspired beauty, easily seen in the film's design and stunning elaborate use of color. The shots of the palace and dungeons are dark and gloomy, as are the scenes showing great battle and fear. While the depressing scenes show real grief, scenes of joy, and most especially are scenes with Elizabeth (played by Cate Blanchett) are always associated with bright light. Director Kapur thinks the character specifically needs the brightness to associate with her radiance. He was most precise and correct.But the film isn't all style, it's also good with the actors and the script. The best performance, and perhaps the best thing about the film, is the stunning performance by Cate Blanchett as the Virgin Queen herself. Perhaps, when accepting the role of the Queen, Ms. Blanchett didn't just read the script, she must have also gotten herself in the character, saying 'I can do this!', and she does, most deserving of her Oscar nomination. In fact, I'll go as far as to say she would have won it. Supporting performances by Geoffrey Rush (as Sir Francis Walsingham), Richard Attenborough (as Sir William Cecil), Joseph Fiennes (as Sir Robert Dudley) and Christopher Eccleston (as the Duke of Norfolk) are all superb.Joined with the superb cinematography, brilliant score and excellent screen play written by Michael Hirst, giving breath of beauty and courage especially to the title character, all add up to the overall magnificence of this dark and stunning thriller. ELIZABETH is terrific entertainment.Rating: ***** out of 5.",10,0,2,29 April 2008
Ice Age: The Meltdown," Bigger, better and cooler.
","My Take: More elaborate than the original, and even better. ICE AGE: THE MELTDOWN is one of those rare instances that a sequel is better than the original, for being something sequels are usually criticized for: being bigger. THE MELTDOWN gives us exactly what sequels promise: more characters, bigger spectacle, add just plain more goodies that its predecessor. But the result is actually successful. While the more adult-oriented comedy might turn off its adult audiences, THE MELTDOWN has more characters, superior animation and even a slightly better story than the first (I did say slightly!). After discovering that the ice caps covering their peaceful valley is starting to thaw, the herd of animals must make their way across the valley to a wooden 'ark' that would save them from the flooding water. On the other hand, Manny (voiced by Ray Romano), Sid (voiced by John Leguizamo) and Diego (voiced by Denis Leary) meets the meek Ellie (voiced by Queen Latifah), a female Mammoth who thinks she's a possum (striped rodent-like critters, likes to do Fear Factor-esquire stunts).But what really steals the show is the interludes featuring the one and only Scrat, perhaps the real star in the original film, who is given much more to do here. Like midget version of Wile E. Coyote, little Scrat gets into more mischief, more trouble than he already had in the first film. Other than trying to bury his precious acorn, he either a.) tries to steal it back from a school of needle-teethed piranha or b.) snatch it from a persistent Condor chick. As a matter of fact, these little interludes save us from the feeble parts of the story. The Mammoth love-story is way too childish for a Mammoth that's voiced by Ray Romano or Queen Latifah (or in this case both). Some of the humor doesn't quite tickle your funny bone if your beyond, perhaps, the age of 10. But ICE AGE: THE MELTDOWN, despite its shortcomings, is a surprisingly elaborate and more entertaining film than the first. And, once again, watch out for that Scrat!

Balls of Fury," Completely forgettable, but thankfully, I wasn't too furious with 'Fury'.
","My Take: It's only occasionally amusing. Will Farrell made my day with two really hilarious sports comedies, TALLADEGA NIGHTS and BLADES OF GLORY. He would have made his winning streak a little stronger if he starred in BALLS OF FURY, another sports comedy that follows the same formula, but then again, even he would have read the script. As written by Thomas Lennon and Robert Ben Garrant, which I learned are among the writers of the TV show RENO 911, BALLS OF FURY is packed with every single slapstick by the book. There's a lots of shots of a guy getting hit on the crotch, Christopher Walken on drag, complements about Maggie Q's sex appeal and every single joke these guys can think up (under the PG-13 level that is!). By this point, BALLS OF FURY is a train headed for disaster. But there's something that stops it from being a total train wreck. What is it? Some of it is actually funny.Okay, I didn't laugh all the way, but being funny alone is worth a lot these days. I expected nothing from BALLS OF FURY except that it would suck. I guess it probably helps. I expected less and less is what I got. BALLS OF FURY never ups the ante for laughs as any of the better comedies these days, but being funny alone is worth the price of admission. Okay, there's nothing especially funny about Christopher Walken in drag, or several guys getting their crotch creamed , but the movie actually finds another way to be funny in just a few moments later. It ain't for everyone, and I probably shouldn't be recommending this.Dan Fogler is not a big comedian and, as it is shown in the film, not an especially funny one. He plays embarrassed former ping-pong champ Randy Daytona who has since given up on his glory days, until an FBI agent who shares an uncanny resemblance with George Lopez, who needs him to help out on tracking down one of FBI's Most Wanted, a crime-boss named Fang (Walken in drag), who happens to be officiating the biggest and most outrageous ping-pong tournament ever. To get back on his own two feet after years of absence, Daytona aids the teachings of ping-pong sage Master Wong (James Hong) and his hot niece Maggie (Maggie Q).It's all antics of course, with Christopher Walken in drag and redoing every role he does on every comedy he starred in. Some of the jokes even have predictable outcomes. You know this guy's gonna get his butt kicked. You know that this guys gay. You know that someone will kiss Maggie Q (and no question whoever gets it either). The whole thing is instantly forgettable. But compared to a few other contenders, this movie is slightly passable. If it's your thing, then see it. Rating: ** out of 5.",4,1,1,25 March 2009
Spider-Man 2," Spidey outdoes Spidey.
","My Take: Better, faster, wilder and deeper than the original. In summer movies' case, the only attempt to make a sequel better than the original is that it should be bigger and louder. The original SPIDER-MAN was everything a fan boy could want from a comic book adaptation (You tell me! I'm not exactly one of them), and the only way the sequel could be better than its predecessor is that the sequel should have bigger special effects, louder surround sound and leave everything else in between (New story? Who cares!).Same is not the case for SPIDER-MAN 2, for not only does it live up to the expectations had for it, it also outdoes and occasionally out-leaps its predecessor. Bigger special effects and louder sound abound, SPIDER-MAN 2 also holds the same sharp focus on characters and a new and different story that isn't just a blueprint for tons of new special effects director Sam Raimi has in store. The character of Peter Parker (still wonderfully played by Tobey Maguire) is more developed, showing how he balances his careers as both the web-slinging superhero and young college student Parker, who also is in desperate need for a job. Kristen Dunst returns as MJ Watson who now blends in deeper in the role. the action-packed moments come in fast, when the film reveals its new and even better villain, the semi-evil Dr. Octopus (Alfred Molina), originally Dr. Octavius, attached with self-operating mechanical arms on his body.Like the very best of summer entertainments, the special effects moments are thrilling and exciting (if you don't find the scene where Spidey tries to stop a runaway train exciting, you're probably low on sugar). But one thing about SPIDER-MAN 2 is the fact that when the moments of character development and human elements come, it doesn't disappoint. The characters are interesting and fine to sit trough, and unlike most characters in summer movies, they don't look like special effects themselves. I'm not really a fan of Sam Raimi's works, but he'll definitely get his audience when making these would-be series, and SPIDER-MAN 2 should serve as a guide on how to make the future sequels.Rating: **** out of 5.",8,3,4,5 July 2008
Batman Returns," It's better than the first in many ways. A visual masterpiece.
","My Take: Definitely the best of the original BATMAN movies.The first BATMAN, although not entirely a perfect film, manages to capture the real atmosphere and dark-comic tradition, much missed in the campy 1960's TV series with Adam West. BATMAN RETURNS continues that tradition, being even more darker than the first. The film was heavily criticized for this, but I hardly see the reason why. It comes to show how creative this film is. It's better than the first film in many ways. A visual masterpiece, no doubt about it, and one of the better comic-book adaptations out there, perhaps since SUPERMAN in 1978.Director Tim Burton, who also directed the first film, gives twice as much creativity to this sequel. Coping, as well, to a more bizarre and oftentimes deeper plot. The film opens with a mean-spirited one, showing a wealthy couple throwing their deformed child to the sewer on a Christmas night, while we follow the cradle floating down the deep sewer and found by a group of penguins who take refuge there. This scene will definitely scare the kids a bit. More will they get scared when they actually meet The Penguin (Danny DeVito). The terrific (or is that terrifying) make-up by Stan Winston is sure to give nightmares.Besides The Penguin, we also have Catwoman (played voluptuously by Michelle Pfieffer), whose origin is yet another scene I wouldn't recommend you let the kids too see. Pfieffer, indeed, is a terrific femme fatale. Christopher Walken provides a convincing, yet not much used, villain as Max Schrek, Gotham's biggest tycoon who plans to create a power plant, which has a drawback that would drain the city's power.The film, while the first had writers Sam Hamm and Warren Skaaren, has a new writer, Daniel Waters. Waters gives the film a more deeper story, which highlights, this time, more on the villains. Whereas the first film focused on Bruce Wayne's reflection on the death of his parents, this time, it focused on The Penguin, yearning to find his parents, and find out why they hated him badly. Rarely has there been a film that, as well, focuses on the back story of the bad guys. Even more less on superhero movies, but BATMAN RETURNS gives us that unique quality.But the great story isn't the only great thing about the film, we also get Burton's great direction. He gives the film both it's deep, dark tradition, as well as his dose of the bizarre and the weird. Danny Elfman's music is terrific, a cross between a superhero film and a dark gloomy film. Stefan Szapsky's photography works as well. It gives the film the film noir-ish atmosphere.At the ending of the first BATMAN, I had a good time, but got the feeling that I could have gotten more. But as the credits rolled in BATMAN RETURNS, it had me gutless and panting, because I got more than I expected, for a sequel.In the end, BATMAN RETURNS does its job, and does it well. It's not a film that I would recommend young kids too see, even if it's a film that usually appeals to them. But anyone above the age of any kid will enjoy this dark and impressive comic book movie.

Finding Nemo," The little fish movie that could.
","My Take: Simply magical, down to the last computer-animated detail. I was at least 13 or 14 years old when this came out, and only now am I reviewing it. But that can't stop me, I have to lay out my sentiments for this clever and occasionally brilliant animated achievement. Not only is it the best, so far, in Pixar's portfolio of animated films, it's one of the very best animated films ever made, period. FINDING NEMO is a well-told fairy tale adventure, but a well-told story is only a bonus compared to the film's awesome look and feel. The movie is visually stunning, with images that flow like living paintings, some of which almost but leaps out the screen. The movie is beautifully crafted, and sometimes, I almost didn't care about anything else. Almost.On the contrary, the story is quite simple. After a tragedy introduced in the opening scenes, Marlin the clown fish (voiced by Albert Brooks) becomes too over-protective of his last son Nemo (voiced by Alexander Gould). Every move he makes is always under the watchful eye of his over-protective father, who couldn't afford to lose him. To prove that he can walk with his own two feet (or is that swim with his own fins?), Nemo approached an anchored divers boat and is abducted by two curious divers and taken far off the Great Barrier Reef. Marlin, guilty for his loss, is determined to find his son, captured by a dentist and placed inside a too-small-for-a-fish aquarium in the dentist's clinic. Along his side is a joyous yet forgetful fish named Dory (voiced by Ellen DeGeneres) who gives a helping fin a long the way, whatever she can remember.This is quite an adventure too. Not only are we introduced to a closer-than-life-like reef, we are also introduced with a clever and elaborate band of characters, including a trio of sharks who swore their lives to be vegetarians (until the call of the wild kicks in), a couple of surfer-dude turtles, a charade-playing school of fish and many other wonders. The animation here is, by far, the most brilliant ones I have ever seen. A colorful and life-filled reef, a forest of jellyfish and a crystal-clear aquarium filled of plastic ornaments have never looked more pristine in this lavish and elaborate adventure. But other than its brilliant design which is considerable enough to recommend the picture, the film is not without a good story, and it is told well. The characters have a great deal of features and characteristics. This is most evident on the character of Dory, who not only has the showmanship of the voice who dubbed her, but also the delight we expect from a true family film.If the story may not apply to you, or you might find it cliché, then FINDING NEMO will still do as a brilliant eye-candy, with one of the best sights I have ever seen in an animated film then and now. Sometimes, sitting in front of a theater or even the small screen and just let the elaborate visuals flow right through you is more than enough to see a movie. Sometimes it's a movie like this one that reminds you the fun that going to movies are.Rating: ***** out of 5.",10,5,7,23 October 2008
Alexander," $100 million worth of turkey.
","My Take: Money alone can't buy decency in this plodding, overlong 'epic'.$155 million in your pocket. Your director is Oliver Stone. Your stars are composed of what many might call Hollywood's beautiful people. And lastly, people are going crazy for big-budget war epics. So how can Oliver Stone go wrong in his epic-scaled Alexander. Nothing really, just possibly one of the most ponderous, most boring movie ever to have big cash to spare. Throughout its dragging 175 minutes (!), I prefer listening to my history teacher and get it over with at about, say, 30 minutes. No big deal though, not even I can survive this ponderous would-be epic. Halfway throughout the picture (or is that even halfway?), I switched off my TV screen and left. I'm just thankful that I didn't see this on the big screen! Bloated and overstuffed, Alexander is also made worse by the fact that it had the potential. Stone, possibly one of the finest and certainly one of the wealthiest filmmakers, is a walking history book. In his films, Stone always seemed certain that he knows exactly about who his subject is. He's knowledgeable and, best of all, bold in his vision. One one hand, he's going the right direction with Alexander. The scale is massive, and the detail, from the impressive sets (that'll do Cecil DeMille justice) to some costume design, are given exquisite attention. Throw in some fancy camera work and a popular cast list and you have a big-budget epic film-in-the-making.Unfortunately, Alexander turns real bad real fast as the film goes on... and on... and on. Worst of all, it moves sluggishly with hardly anything happening at all to anyone and anything. To throw in some 'excitement' to the scene, Stone gives as some expensive battle scenes (aka the 'money shot') to enliven up the experience, but it is put to vain as we are forced to drag about excessive babble and emphasis on Alexander's (an underwhelming Colin Farrell) homosexuality. You won't believe it 'till you see it! The cast is wasted. Angelina Jolie is forced to ham about as Olympias, Val Kilmer rarely has enough time to flex his muscles as King Philip, and Anthony Hopkins, forced to simply just read the script aimlessly as a subdued Ptolemy. So far as I've watched (though I think it wouldn't change a thing even if I watched the entire film), Alexander is a titanic bore. Big-budget film-making at its worst.Rating: *1/2 out of 5.",3,0,1,22 December 2008
Hot Fuzz," Bring in the noise, bring in the 'Fuzz'.
","My Take: Lampoons over-the-top action movies by turning itself into one. Look out Jerry Bruckheimer! Movie parodies are usually banal these days, especially since the film relies too heavily on references rather than real hilarity. Luckily we got the Brits who still happen to know how to make a purely funny genre satire, and isn't afraid to even go beyond over the top. The creative team behind SHAUN OF THE DEAD, also a brilliant British comedy import, proceeds with yet another hilarious and clever spoof that is possibly the funniest one I've seen in a long time. Possible one of the best comedies I have ever seen. Here's the buzz people: It's HOT FUZZ.The talented comedic team-up of Edgar Wright (director), Simon Pegg and Nick Frost (actors) give another shot at parodying a certain film genre and result in a darkly funny and cleverly hilarious winner that'll throw the straight action team-up of Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay back to the storyboards. Now, joke's on you guys! But other than just lampooning everything on the action movie dictionary from Arnold to Woo, the film takes on a life of its own. It has a story that also (mind the 'also') functions as a clothesline for the numerous clever laughs and some terrific star performances. Yes, Pegg and Frost alone make for one star-studded affair. They work really well together.The plot follows top MET Sgt. Nicholas Angel (Pegg), the roughest, toughest police in the force. In fact, he's so good, they reassigned him since his superiors are worried that he's no-holds bar attitude makes the force look bad. They reassigned Angel to the idyllic town of Stanford, where nothing at all happens. The only greatest 'crime' of the town is graffiti, a statue-like street performer and daily escapades with an escaped pet swan. But not to lately, a series of bizarre (and very bloody) 'accidents' occur, people turned up dead. Or murdered, believes Angel who thinks that there's some serial killer who's making everything happen in a town where nothing at all happens. Angel, partnered by local police sidekick Danny Butterman (Frost), try to figure things out and set things right, big city-style.The film contains as many pop references, as well as those in many action pictures, from famous key scenes (shooting with two guns in a slow-motion shot reminiscent a scene from John Woo's FACE/OFF) and overused clichés such as obvious villains (Timothy Dalton? A sneering bad guy? Up to no good? Come on!) and action overdose (the slam-bang finale inspired from even the best of Bruckheimer & Don Simpson). It does these so with a clever and biting sense of humor. The jokes, references and lampoons are actually funny, and not just for the time. HOT FUZZ doesn't even require you to take your thinking caps off. But mot of all, there's the comic timing and clever in-turns of Pegg and Frost who are terrific on-screen. Their funny, and smart enough to know the audiences expected something smart from them. The movie is over-the-top to be sure, and there is a high level of violent content much like 'Shaun'. Not all audiences of all tastes will enjoy everything about HOT FUZZ, but there's so much more to see here, and I'd be damned if I stop you from seeing it. If funny is what you always wanted from a comedy (and you'd better consult your dictionary if you don't), then you'd better call The Fuzz.Rating: ***** out of 5.",10,0,0,2 August 2008
The Mummy," The best thing about it is it has almost everything you want in summer movies.
","My Take: It's tons of fun and what else should it be? Summer movies have become too complicated over its last few years. But THE MUMMY brings back the old-fashioned action movie tradition. They have this belief that the old-school feel still works, and it really does. THE MUMMY may not be a totally perfect summer movie, but it's still darn good 'can't take your eyes of the screen' entertainment, but the best thing about it is it has almost everything you want in summer movies. Whether it's adventure, thrills, horror, suspense and laughs, THE MUMMY makes all these formulas work and work together forming a delightful summer blockbuster that delivers entertainment that aren't just special effects.The opening sequence features, perhaps, one of the best and most convincing shot of an Egyptian civilization. It was such a convincing combination of model shots, matte effects and actual shots that its believable. It is perhaps one of the best recreation of ancient Egypt since, perhaps, the large-scale sets in Cecil B. DeMille's THE TEN COMMANDMENTS in 1956, which we now know is only made in a studio. This one was actually more convincing, including shots of large pyramids and the crowds and chariots. This opening introduces the Pharaoh's head priest Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) who has an affair with the Pharaoh's mistress. As punishment, he is to be mummified alive, having flesh-eating beetles feed on his flesh.This is then changed in to the usual formula of old-fashioned adventure flicks wherein they must find the ancient lost city, uncover its untold wealth and leads to the deadly curse. Then they add the explorers' curiosities which unlocks the deadly curse and unleashes the mummy Imhotep loose on earth. Let the good times roll! The action sequences get a bit silly (even with the spectacular effects) and the storyline borderline ridiculous, but that's just the point. THE MUMMY is a throwback to the good ol' action-adventures of yore, and frankly, there's not much of them to go around anymore. Brendan Fraser (as Indiana Jones-inspired Rick O'Connell) and Rachel Weisz (as the adorable intrepid Evelyn), and some adorable witty dialog manage to occupy as much screen-time as the action and suspense. The action sequences, of course, are terrific in their own way. The sight of a creatures' face suddenly rise above the sand is some show of terrific special effects (and to think seeing a sandstorm up close is amazing enough).Along with INDEPENDENCE DAY, THE MUMMY is perhaps one of the decades loudest, most exciting, most gimmicky summer action movie of its decade. Just like the other said film, I enjoyed the film more than just for its special-effects. This one has story, characters and a celebration of screen excitement (all good), a bunch of elements much needed, especially to today's summer flicks. THE MUMMY, perhaps, may be among the few special effects-bound movies were I don't criticize the special effects, which usually becomes the centerpiece in summer movies. This one has story to go along with it, and, boy, was it a good one.Rating: ***** out of 5.",10,0,0,5 October 2007
Ed Wood," Burton and Depp's best.
","My Take: An interesting and hilarious biopic, as well as a loving tribute to the film-loving side of Ed Wood. Tim Burton is one of my favorite directors, and ED WOOD is probably his best film. Along with the brilliant EDWARD SCISSORHANDS, ED WOOD is another personal work from Burton wherein he feels right at home with the story and its lead character of the gifted outcast. Whereas EDWARD reflected Burton's childhood, ED WOOD reflected on Burton as the imaginative outcast in Hollywood, as well as his friendship with the late actor Vincent Price (which was uncannily similar to Wood's own friendship with his idol Bela Lugosi). Johnny Depp really looks as if he is Ed Wood. The weirdness and all. But he is not, by any means, a mockery of the real thing. Instead, Burton and Depp revel in the eccentricity and odd imagination of the man. Instead of condescending the man's lack of any real talent or experience, Burton and screenwriters Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski embrace them man's love for his work and his insistence to do what he wants. Here we see he loves movies and not the business they make. Wood may be the worst director of all time as he is claimed to be, but does do it right. Other than Depp, Martin Landau's performance as the late Bela Lugosi is one you've got to see to believe. From the accent to the excellent make-up effects, Landau IS Lugosi. It sort of reminded me of the making of Ed Wood's PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE where Wood used stock footage and a double to make it look like it was the recently-deceased Lugosi's true final film. Well, Burton would have made Wood proud; this is the closest we can get to bringing the man who played Dracula back from the grave. I really love this movie. Take my word for it, 'Ed Wood' is a great film; one of Burton's best films and perhaps Depp's greatest and most eccentric performance to date. Rating: ***** out of 5.",10,0,0,14 February 2007
Home Alone," The Ideal Holiday Family Movie.
","My Take: Not a holiday classic in the lines of IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, but a mild classic all its own. Ever since I watched it since I was a kid until now, that I'm a big movie fan, 'Home Alone' is still a very hilarious and effective comedy. It may not just be up there among the highest-grossing films of all time, but also among the funniest films ever. It's fast with the laughs, yet still not ignoring the family values, which the film must have. The story is very memorable and fresh, and always worth a look. Little Macaulay Culkin delivers all he can in his performance as Kevin. While Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are fantastically appealing as the two burglars who gets into sticky situations when they underestimate the power of a little eight-year old.For those who haven't watched it yet (which is very doubtful), goo watch it now. For those who've seen it several times (like me), go watch it again, this time, with the entire family. Honestly it doesn't disappoint.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",7,0,0,4 May 2007
The Jungle Book," Still great family fun.
","My Take: A fine treat for the whole family. I can honestly say I enjoyed my childhood, if not to say it was definitely the best years of my life (I could go on with describing what made it such a treat, but then again I wouldn't have much time to talk about this movie). So I guess it's safe to say I remember much of it, especially one of the key moments of it. Particularly, I remember what movies I tuned in as a kid. Yes, I used to sit down on the sofa and pop in a VHS of JURASSIC PARK and at least one or two (okay, maybe three) of the LAND BEFORE TIME video sequels. But before other than the VHS, there's the Laserdisc, and other than THE LAND BEFORE TIME, there was THE JUNGLE BOOK.Recalling it know, however, I have a few minimal afterthoughts. While I can honestly say THE LAND BEFORE TIME (only the first one!) eventually emerged as a contemporary classic on my book, THE JUNGLE BOOK was a fine family entertainment, but quite not up to being the classic I presumed. Still, if entertainment is what you wish it will have when you give it a quick rerun, it sure won't disappoint. From the voice casting to the animation, down to the beat of 'Bear Necessities', THE JUNGLE BOOK is fine family fun.Based on the story by Rudyard Kipling (with a purely Disney twist on it of course), jungle boy Mowgli (voiced by Bruce Reitherman) is accompanied by Bagheera the black panther (voiced by Sebastian Cabot) and the wacky, groovy Baloo the bear (voiced with glee by Phil Harris) to head for the fabled 'Man-village' which they believe is where he belongs. Mowgli, reluctant to leave, prefers to stay and groove it with Baloo, while the man-hungry tiger Shere Khan (voiced with menace by George Sanders) and a slimy serpent named Kaa (a familiar voice by Sterling Holloway) looks at him as supper.It didn't look to me like a classic as it used to be, but it's fine entertainment nonetheless. A fast-paced, often funny adventure for the young and old.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",7,0,1,4 April 2009
The Day After Tomorrow," No Al Gore, but tons of fun.
","My Take: Suspend your disbelief and enjoy the thrill-ride.Armed once again with a big budget and a cookie-cutter disaster movie of a script, director Roland Emmerich is ready to make another big-budgeted disaster epic this side of GODZILLA. Too bad the writers didn't consult Al Gore before writing their weather-gone-bad disaster epic called THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW, but even if its as silly as a guilty pleasure 70's disaster movie, it's still a lot of fun with some really neat special effects and fine action scenes. Sometimes you just have that hankering for a massive disaster movie, and I think other than the late Irwin Allen, no one does it like Roland Emmerich.The film is Emmerich's signaling of the overwhelming Global Warming issue, but it's sometimes silly, it can't quite be anymore than a summer movie. But then again, what summer movie is complete without a a little pseudo-science? The manner that the film doesn't want to be too deep makes it more enjoyable and makes us simple accept it as a popcorn summer flick. With that, its fairly enjoyable. Besides, the sight of tornadoes ripping Los Angeles apart (not sparing the Hollywood sign), a tidal wave ravage New York City (what Roland Emmerich film wouldn't), a quick freeze that makes icicles out of those it touches and falling hale the size of footballs is more than enough to see it as, simply, a summer movie with incredible sights.Dennis Quaid stars as a meteorologist Jack Hall who, like in all disaster movies, is the guy who predicts the danger. While doing an experiment in the polar regions, he discovers that all the ice is melting due to cause of Global Warming (but the dangers that follow can almost be enough to be called 'Global Freezing'). Of course, there's the guy who doubts his paranoid delusions, and that man happens to be the Vice-President (Kenneth Walsh) who believes Jack's precautions could cost a million dollars of expense.When the calamity does arrive, as far as we know, Jack must make his way through bad weather to save his son (Jake Gyllenhaal), who goes to New York with his decathlon crew, while his wife (Sela Ward) waits haplessly with a cancer patient in a hospital waiting for rescue. Special effects abound for most of the running time. When Jack isn't being periled by a blizzard of flash freeze, his son in New York is being chased by savage wolves gone mad.At least THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW doesn't try to be anything else. It's fun for what it is: a throwback to the 70's disaster movie the likes of Irwin Allen. It's silly (cliches abound), but granted it's fun in its own merit. The special effects are great and enjoyable.Rating: **** out of 5.",8,0,1,14 May 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," 3rd 'Pirates' movie has AWE-some effects, action.
","My Take: Though confusing, this third 'Pirates' movie isn't out of batteries just yet. (Pardon me with using the abbreviations, but I guess you know exactly what they stand for.) Funny how the 2-disc DVD of PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: AT WORLD'S END which I got for Christmas included a list of the many questions asked by fans about this third, possibly the biggest, chapter in the highly successful, wildly excessive yet strongly executed series. But after seeing the film (having overlooked it for a very long time since its release), I realized what the list was for exactly. For, while the biggest most elaborate 'Pirates' of them all, it was also the longest and most confusing. While the first and the second film in the series had their own shares of overlong and muddled moments, POTC: AWE has probably the most confusing plot, not just of the series, but probably for any summer-action 'event' blockbuster for a very long time.The new adventure, still penned by the originals' Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio, tries to tie up the loose ends from the previous chapter, DEAD MAN'S CHEST, and putting the big-budget series to a complete close (reminding me much of what George Lucas did with RETURN OF THE JEDI). But before the curtains drop, POTC: AWE packs in as much twists, unlikely conclusions and other goodies that the film is either too big to fit in the package, or the package is just too big to fit in to everyone's heads. Too much details, too much characters and too much conclusions make for one confusing escapade that's a bit too hard to follow. By this time, POTC: AWE would seem to drown its own vessel with its own cargo, but in comes Johnny Depp's hilarious Jack Sparrow, in comes the elaborate special effects and in comes are favorite characters which we all loved from the series. When they do, the show gives us exactly what we came for.POTC: AWE may be too hard to follow, but it is exactly what we came for: A big-budget, go-for-broke action adventure that takes us on a roller-coaster ride that doesn't have a seat belt to keep you from falling from the edge of your seat. The 'Pirates' series has certainly evolved form the enjoyable, if somewhat overrated, CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL. And while this one isn't as good as POTC: DMC, arguably the best in the series, it's still the biggest and most elaborate. In this third (and probably final) chapter, The gang of Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) and back-from-the-dead Capt. Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) is off to rescue Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp, still in perfect shape) from the legendary Davey Jones' locker, then do battle with their angry-as-hell foes including the corrupt Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander), the slimy Davey Jones (Bill Nighy) and an entire armada of battleships, leading to a 1-hour climax that only a talented action director and a team of creative special effects wizards can create, and the team behind this, and the rest of the film, is just that.Director Gore Verbinski is a top-flight action director, here showing his best in the film's most action-packed sequences. On the other hand, he also shows his talents in humor in the film's funnier sequences, joined by Depp and Rush's hilarious performances (but I guess that goes to everyone). The special effects are still astonishing, the action is one thrill after another and the comedy is still sharp and hilarious. For pure action and comedy, trust this pirate!

X-Men," A second look: X-MEN.
","My Take: Forgettble but a lot of fun.I'm not a fan of the Marvel Comics series. Suffice to say I wasn't really wild with the big-budget big-screen series. I've seen all of them on the big-screen and enjoyed them (especially X2), and I've seen the repeatedly on television, but I didn't have much to talk about them. Their great entertainment but little else. Still, after seeing the original X-MEN a few nights ago, my original opinion has been improved. While I still won't have anything to talk about it the next day, I'm giving it more credit than the one i gave it.I enjoyed the special effects and the action the first time, but looking back, there's actually much more going for it. The characters were given enough depth. And that director Bryan Singer wasn't exactly the biggest fanboy of the comic book series makes his job in X-MEN much more impressive. Performances by Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen and a young Anna Paquin are great, which is much to say considering that there's a lot of things going on with the action and effects. I may not be wild about it but, for what its worth, X-MEN is still fine entertainment.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",7,0,1,17 July 2008
Spider-Man 3," Great sequel, but one can't help but think...
","My Take: A rushed and bloated mess. But an extremely enjoyable and exciting one. ...isn't this all too much? This was indeed a great sequel, not just for more CGI. But it is clear that everything goes way too fast in the frantic first half. It is fun and is as deserving as the second (the first was good, but not as great). One of the film's problem lies on its abundance on special-effects. Particularly, in a 'battle that lies within', do we really need the new villain, Sandman. Thomas Haden Church tries hard to be significant, but other than the fact that he might possibly have something to do with killing Peter Parker's uncle, he has very little to do with the film. With or without Sandman, Sam Raimi would have wrapped up a great film. And, unlike Green Goblin and Doc Ock, his origin of becoming The Sandman is, to but it bluntly, rushed. Obviously, the screenwriters just rushed it so they could get on with the circus of special effects.But lets skip the negatives. what really gave me the urge to give it a positive review is the superb performance by Tobey Maguire as, not Spider-man, but as Peter Parker. This time around, he isn't just play a nerd, but a different side of Parker, after the 'battle within' rages inside him. For my opinion, this is his best performance among the three films. The only villain that seems to matter is Venom, a symbolism of inner evil. It was good for the writers to think of that, besides just turning him into another villain. My overall review, 'Spider-man 3' is not that bad. For me, it was the most symbolical of the series, which was a good thing for the genre. But too bad, everything is turned bad when it comes to direction. Sam Raimi had so much in his mind at the time that it seems that putting them all together in one sitting is showing too much of a good idea. Let us be thankful, at least, that 'Spider-man 3' is not another 'Batman and Robin'.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",7,1,5,6 May 2007
The Terminator," Those men and their killing machines.
","My Take: Revolutionary for its storytelling and influences to the genre. Highly regarded as one of the best sci-fi films of all time, James Cameron's brainchild THE TERMINATOR, released in 1984, has severely suffered a sort of dated feel. Suffering in comparison to the ever-advancing technology, the special effects and make-up have dated real badly from the low-tech technology available at the 80's to today. But in its heart, THE TERMINATOR still holds true with its story and anti-war message that still holds truth and never is too preachy, in fact not at all. THE TERMINATOR may not be the place to locate revolutionary special effects and action scenes, but it's in the writing department where the true heart of the film lies, as is its success. Arnold Schwarzenegger is still one of the creepiest bad guys around as the cold, emotionless cyborg from the violent future sen back to modern 1984 to kill a woman (Linda Hamilton) who will spawn a son who will lead humanity against a rebellion against war-machines in a futuristic war. Michael Biehn has gone surprisingly out of steam as a hero, so is Hamilton's character who rarely does anything more than play second-bananas. But THE TERMINATOR still holds a story and some key moments to hold its audiences. In other words, it still is a classic remnant of its age, an age where writing goes first above effects and star players.Rating: **** out of 5.",8,0,1,13 July 2008
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Take another trip to Del Toro's labyrinth.
","My Take: An elaborate set of imaginative creature effects and the always interesting lead character make the show worth watching.I have a confession to make: I haven't seen the original HELLBOY yet. And neither have I seen it when I saw the much-praised sequel HELLBOY II: THE GOLDEN ARMY. But that's just what I really like about this sequel: It doesn't require you to have seen the original to fully enjoy this weird and entertaining excursion. Seeing the original would certainly add to the experience, but taken in its own rights, HELLBOY II does what a sequel should do: Not just live up to the expectations left by its predecessor, but also shine as a stand-alone effort.And yet I have another confession: I have not seen Guillermo Del Toro's crown jewel PAN'S LABYRINTH yet. But seeing HELLBOY II, I am more than impressed by his wild imagination. HELLBOY may have been based on a comic book, but for anyone who isn't a fan of the comics, Hellboy is Del Toro's own creation. Like what Tim Burton did with BATMAN, Del Toro has modeled Hellboy (Ron Perlman) as his own creation on-screen, and he's a very interesting character. Perlman never wastes his opportunity to provide depth as well as nuance to his character. Perlman proves himself worthy, not just an ideal action hero (under tons of make-up), but as yet another actor who successfully embodies the role of a comic-book character.As in PAN'S LABYRINTH, Del Toro populates the world of HELLBOY II with some truly fascinating and intriguing creatures. Roger Ebert made a truthful compliment by stating that the world of HELLBOY II reminded him of the famous Cantina scene from STAR WARS. What George Lucas has conceived within only a few minutes of screen time in his movie, Del Toro manages to do for 2 hours. The creatures are imaginative, not just in look but in personality, and they are at an abundance. Plus, they're also mostly done using make-up effects rather than CGI, which makes them all the more real. Add to Del Toro's imaginative set pieces, he is a master storyteller. From the opening scene, where 'Broom' Bruttenholm (John Hurt) tells the legend of the 'Golden Army' to a young Hellboy, Del Toro exhibits is true talents at telling a good story. There are moments of thrills and even laughs, and the visuals are superb. Supporting performances and some neat special effects (notice that I praised the CGI later in in this review) make for one worthy adventure ride. HELLBOY II isn't perfect, but it sure is great at what it was doing.Rating: **** out of 5.",8,4,5,20 December 2009
Cloverfield," What the American Godzilla should have been.
","My Take: An exciting modern take on the old-fashioned monster movie.Take a worn-out premise, give it a modern spin and make it just as scary and exciting for today's audiences. That's exactly what producer J.J. Abrams (ALIAS) and director Matt Reeves does and the premise being the old-fashioned 'attack-of-the-giant-monster'. The result was CLOVERFIELD, an exciting and frightening modern monster movie. I almost never get scared in scary movies nowadays, but this BLAIR WITCH meets GODZILLA does the trick. Here's a movie that begs to be seen on the big screen, where the loud sound system could take advantage of your senses. But seeing the movie on the small screen, with maybe a few lights dimmed and a bag of popcorn at hand, the movie is nonetheless effective.The premise is simple: A giant unseen monster attacks good ol' New York, as seen from the perspective of someone with a digital camera. The movie opens with a surprise farewell party for Rob (Michael Stahl-David) who's leaving New York for a new job in Japan. Documenting the event is Hud (T.J. Miller) was asked to interview Rob's friends during the entire party, including Rob's girlfriend Beth (Jessica Lucas) who expresses her reluctance for leaving. But once Hud films an explosion and a decapitated Statue of Liberty in the distance, the movie gets going. The disembodied head of the Statue flies across the street and the giant unseen behemoth proceeds to rip apart the Big Apple, and the movie gives us that uneasy feeling of being there as mayhem arises. The characters aren't exactly authentic, but here's an instance where they don't need to be. By the end of the film, you couldn't care less if Rob would choose the job in Japan or stay with his girlfriend; you just want them to get the hell out of there alive. That's what makes them effective.After 9/11, it's hard not to think that the mayhem in CLOVERFIELD echoes the events of that tragic event. This is probably the most accurate metaphoric view of the 9/11 since Spielberg's WAR OF THE WORLDS. But above all, CLOVERFIELD is a great monster movie. It takes this usually worn-put genre and makes it just as scary and as exciting as such classics as KING KONG, THEM! and THE BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS used to be. CLOVERFIELD is bound to join other luminaries in the genre as one of the best monster movies of all time, and if that sounds like a faint praise, it isn't.Rating: **** out of 5.",8,0,2,3 October 2009
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," 'Jedi' closes the trilogy with everything we would expect from STAR WARS.
","My Take: As the original STAR WARS series comes to a close, this final chapter has everything fans have hoped for. THE RETURN OF THE JEDI (re-titled as STAR WARS: EPISODE VI-THE RETURN OF THE JEDI during its re-release) is the last (chronologically) of the original STAR WARS trilogy, and it is also a self rating chapter in the series. 'Jedi' will always be ranked third best in the original trilogy (with THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK being the best). It's not as dark and deep as 'Empire', nor is it quite as original as STAR WARS (Episode IV: A NEW HOPE). Actually, 'Jedi' owes more on the elements from the original film (including, of course, the Death Star and some of the Jedi duels). But I wouldn't complain, since if this was something else, I wouldn't have liked it. 'Jedi' has everything I liked about the saga, from the exciting and comic fun of the original, as well as the deepened mythology of the second. Not to mention of course the terrific special effects work which were great, not just because of its innovation, but also the imagination it took to make them.One of the best examples of these wild imaginations in special effects are in the first half of the film which takes place on the crowded palace of the loathsome crime lord Jabba the Hutt. This place is filled with strange-looking beings and bizarre creatures which is almost twice as much than those featured in the Cantina scene in the original STAR WARS. The film opens with those adorable droid duo C3PO (performed by Anthony Daniels) and R2-D2 entering this creaky palace bargaining for the freedom of Han Solo (HArrison Ford), who is still frozen in carbonate block. This leads to, not one but, two battles between our hero Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and two gruesome monsters. One lives in a dungeon beneath Jabba's throne room. The other lives in a sandpit and slowly digests its victims for a thousand years, which is an enjoyable and exciting battle in tradition of other entertaining adventure movies. The entertainment continues on later on a battle in a small planet moon introducing a bunch of cute and lovable creatures called Ewoks (probably added to give the film more cutesy as well as irony, since these little bunch of teddy bear-like beings beat the butts out of Imperial troops), as well as a second attempt at yet another Death Star. But one of the most awaited sequence in the film is the final duel between Luke Skywalker and the evil Darth Vader (Dave Prowse; voiced by James Earl Jones), which we no know is Luke's Father.THE RETURN OF THE JEDI is the second STAR WARS film that creator George Lucas didn't direct, passing it once again to another director. This time, it's director Richard Marquand, who is really not a match for Lucas in the first film, nor is he definitely a match for Lucas' mentor Irvin Kershner who directed the second. But he still does a fine job, especially when it comes to adding a lot of fun on those exciting sequences, a grand tradition in the STAR WARS legacy. The imagination, both on the special-effects and the storyline, is still not left behind.I am ranking 'Jedi' on par with the first movie. Though not as deep and cleverly achieved as 'Empire', 'Jedi' is still exciting, entertaining, imaginative and anything else positive about a fantasy film. It's just a lovable epic romp with its heart on the right place.Rating: ***** out of 5.",10,0,1,9 January 2008
Alien," The '2001' of monster movies.
","My Take: A gripping sci-fi thriller that hides in the dark and leaps at you when you least expect it. (This is an extension of the review I wrote in February 2007)If Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY revolutionized what we conceived of science fiction movies, then Ridley Scott's ALIEN is the 2001 of monster pictures. Here's a movie that takes something familiar (something as old as a space monster and the doomed interstellar crew in preys on) and serves the formula right. Add a touch of effective atmosphere and suspense courtesy of the slimiest, most streamlined monster in movie history since the shark from JAWS and you got a classic. I read a review of this film where the critic described ALIEN as a haunted house movie set in the infinity of space. I couldn't think of a better way to describe it. It is in this film that we are introduced to the familiar plot (as of today) about crew members of commercial ship who come upon an alien roaming around their ship, killing them of one by one. This plot would soon be borrowed by other Sci-fi films, but only 'Alien' does it right. Pretty unique for its kind. Unique too, is the film's use of super-advance technology, pretty new back then. The film is one of the first to exhibit the cryogenic sleep in space. I haven't seen anything as unique as that.The film does all the Sci-fi things right, and even goes beyond its knowledge. Ridley Scott does it with great creativity, making up for some little-known flaws in the film. Little-known because Scott does what needs to be done, and done right.Rating: ***** out of 5.",10,0,1,20 February 2007
Empire of the Sun," A Small Boy in a Great War.
","My Take: An imperfect, yet magnificent effort. Visually stunning and honestly tear-jerking. This is among my favorites in the war film genre. It clearly shows us the drama and power of WWII. What do you expect, Steven Spielberg directed it. It's supposed to be this wonderful, if not really perfect. Future Batman Christian Bale stars as a young boy named Jim 'Jaime' Graham, who is separated from his parents, and kept inside a Japanese camp. His performance was great, even for a young actor who is less known at the time. John Malkovich and Miranda Richardson are great too. But among the things that stunned me in this movie is Spielberg realistic and stunning recreation of the great World War. The film is also wonderfully shot in Shanghai, capturing the the feel of being in the People's Republic of China. 'Empire of the Sun' is really a fantastic tale that's sure to inspire, delight, shed some tears and uplift the soul of its viewers.Rating: **** out of 5.",8,6,13,16 February 2007
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," A different but underrated chapter in the saga.
","My Take: A flawed love story can't undermine this 2nd STAR WARS prequel. It was surprising how the 'Star Wars' series went from gold to bronze. Director George Lucas spun gold with his 'Star Wars' trilogy and 'Indiana Jones' series (with friend Steven Spielberg). But when it comes to the prequel to his beloved space saga trilogy, critics and the public alike couldn't care less to treat them well. But for me, I wouldn't call the 'Star Wars' 'prequels' a disappointment, for at least George Lucas tried to give us a 'full story' of his well-beloved series.Unlike 'Star Wars Ep. 1: The Phantom Menace', this one goes deeper, keeping us much closer to the events of the trilogy. Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) is now a young apprentice of Jedi Master Obi Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor). When he is tasks to protect Senator Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman), he falls in love with her, which is a violation that could expel Anakin from the Jedi Order. But a bigger problem rose for the Republic. An assassination attempt on the Senator launches an investigation, which leads to the discovery of a Clone army to fight with the Republic side against the separatists, led by Count Dooku (Christopher Lee).Although some might as well forget about this, I am definitely with those who will defend it. Yes, Lucas' talents are much left to the special-effects, but still, Lucas gives us an interesting combination of space-age saga, forbidden love, vengeance and a futuristic version of then issues and conflicts on corruption and annihilation. Not number one in the box-office? Who cares, it still a great movie which wasn't quite as great as the ones it competed with (actually, I liked this better than SPIDER-MAN). But this is still a great movie, which is, at times, lost with understanding from its viewers.Rating: **** out of 5.",8,1,3,4 May 2007
Predator," RAMBO meets ALIEN.
","My Take: Flawed yet exciting variation of ALIEN crossed with RAMBO.I really love this sci-fi/action thriller, definitely one of this best of its kind(next to 'Alien' and its sequel 'Aliens'). Arnold Schwarzenegger is perfect for the role, the special-effects are awesome and Stan Winston's terrifically designed creature combine to make it an all-time favorite in the genre. Schwarzenegger leads a group of commandos in the Central American jungle, only to get hunted by an intelligent and cunning alien, with weapons unlike ours. The Predator should really astound inventors with its advance technology. The film also has much of the qualities of commando movies like 'Rambo:First Blood' and sci-fi terror of 'Alien' (hence my review title). Schwarzenegger uses much of the weapons he has, but he's still quite heroic like Stallone was in 'Rambo'. The Predator looks and acts quite like an 'Alien' from the said 1979 film. Slick, unpredictable and fast. The sequel 'Predator 2' is also good, but the showdown 'Alien vs. Predator' is truly awful. But the original is still a great film, even on today's standards.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",7,5,6,14 February 2007
The Bourne Identity," 'Bourne' to greatness.
","My Take: Slick and stylish adaptation of the classic Ludlum bestseller.Robert Ludlum's THE BOURNE IDENTITY, adapted here in this 2002 big screen romp, is an old-fashioned thriller, but a heck of a good one. It's an old-fashioned espionage chase thriller, owing a lot to Matt Damon's excellent performance in the title role, and the superior direction and pacing. Like all good mystery thrillers, this one keeps us gripped, guessing and interested from the first frame to the last. I was hooked.The film centers on Jason Bourne, a man who finds himself in the middle of the ocean, with two bullets lodged into his back. he doesn't know who he is, and what happened to him. After being rescued by a fishing boat, he is dropped to France where he tries to find out who he is. He finds out he's a government assassin, a professional at the job, who the government no longer trusts. Now, he's a target of the government he used to work for. To escape, he aids help of Marie (Franka Potente), who also becomes a target of the same agency.There are a number of great chase scenes that follow. There's the Paris chase scene where a Mini Copper is chased by the police. The film is mostly in low-key, but it keeps the energy level really high. There's action here and there, but some really good thrills as well, and a tight plot that keeps us interested and hooked. The performances are great, as is the script. Overall, a terrific thriller.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",7,0,1,21 May 2008
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," 'Rings' proud and true.
","My Take: Grand-scale epics at best. After plagued with much hype and anticipations upon release, THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING, the first of three adaptations of J.R.R. Tolkien's classic book series, is a highly satisfying and intriguing trip to a dark and yet magical new enterprise. New Zealand-born director Peter Jackson, like most of Hollywood's directors and producers, demand a great deal of money to create such project, but unlike others, Jackson has his own vision. He doesn't let the film blunder with too much special effects without first seeing what's more important, plot characters and storyline. With such great framework, it's no wonder why FELLOWSHIP is steady and strong.Firstly, the movie is filled with dazzling special effects. There are dozens of flashy advances on the effects. Now, we are able to create towers, civilizations, creatures, caverns, and many other locale and characters in grand scale. It's a convincing look at a terrific combination of miniatures, digital effects and the like. This is a grand motion picture achievement, and it's great to look at. This cost a lot to be sure, and it shows.But the movie isn't all flash and dazzle, it's also about characters and a story, and it doesn't water down Tolkien. His vision of Middle-Earth is wonderfully and respectfully visioned by Jackson, who takes his imagination to create it. The characters that populate the story are actually valuable. Frodo (Elijah Wood) and his gang of Hobbits, and the rest of the Fellowship, comprise a surprising amount of friendship. These characters are a real fellowship, as we care about them, and what happens to them. The plot isn't tailor-made for Tolkien fanatics alone. The plot is easily explained and punctuated, and avoids much confusion.Although the adaptations of the follow-ups are more superior, it only shows that something great can actually be something even bigger. THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING is superb, epic-scale, with heart.Rating: ***** out of 5.",10,0,0,25 May 2008
Armageddon," Michael Bay directs a different kind of 'rock' in big-budget disaster film.
","Review summary: Put your mind to rest and wallow in the mindless, summer excitement.To start with, 'Armageddon' was a fine film, but it relied too much on its wealth on special effects and big-named cast to give audiences a charm, but it misses a lot from what it needed. There is simply no comparison of this film to its counterpart 'Deep Impact'. Armageddon lacks a deeper human dimension. But what the heck! This movie's fun! The reason for the comparison is they both show the same plot, they both give as a glimpse of the end-of-the-world, by a comet, and a group of 'saviors' who try to blow it up and save the world. This time, it's Bruce Willis and his oil rig crew who are hired by NASA to pilot two space shuttle to blow up a large comet (aka 'The Global Killer') before it hits the Earth.The plot of course, is easy to take. I mean how hard will it be to understand a plot of a killer comet and a group of oil rig workers who sacrifice their lives, I guess the longest range of time will be 5 seconds. Stupid, yes, but its so wrong, its just all right. The characters, of course, don't sum up for too much, considering that the film stars big names (names like Bruce Willis or Ben Affleck may have you quite disappointed) . If the film added more to what it can offer, it would have turned out better. But as it is, Armageddon is worth a summer movie thumbs up and a big bowl of popcorn.Rating: **** out of 5.",8,1,2,24 April 2007
The Village," Either you love it, or you hate it.
","My Take: Some will be let down by how Shymalan plays with audience's expectations, but it's sometimes a poignant and interesting film.I have long since been a defender of M. Night Shymalan's THE VILLAGE. Sure, I too didn't get it the first time, yet it grew into me several viewings later. Ever since, it has been an intriguing if imperfect excursion. But the fact that it doesn't really appeal to everyone makes THE VILLAGE all the more open to debate, and more inviting to revisit. So I looked back on this excursion and realized how interesting, if still flawed, film it is. Whether or not the film is a misunderstood masterpiece or a terribly misguided 'personal' effort, it never fails to be worth of scrutiny. M. Night Shyamalan remains one of Hollywood's most misunderstood directors in Hollywood, famous for many modern horror films like 'The Sixth Sense' and 'Signs'. In this, one of his later works, is set in a small 19th century village, secluded by a dark forest which are forbidden to them, due to some strange beast rumored to live there. If there is one thing I'd blame for the downfall of THE VILLAGE is the advertising. Advertising it as a horror movie rather than what it really is is a shallow cway to put it. Sure, the twist ending is the kind that will divide the audience into two; not everyone's gonna march with Shymalan's parade. Well not everyone is going to like THE VILLAGE, yet but that only proves he's one of the more misunderstood film minds in Hollywood today. Shymalan may have gotten some bad feedback after this, but I'm here to defend him on his behalf.The film may not be that scary, but M. Night Shyamalan manages to make the human characters interesting and the film atmospheric. It may not be his best film, but perhaps, it's his most intriguing and often profound. It's either you love it, or just leave it alone. Rating: ****1/2 out of 5.",8,0,0,19 March 2007
Pitch Black," All lights-off for ALIENS lite.
","My Take: Derivative yet entertaining. Slick but inferior, David Twohy's PITCH BLACK, even with its slickness, is just another monster movie, and quite a decent one at that. Although it won't break the sci-fi barrier, even if it doesn't have an A-list cast and even without some great special effects work, it makes for a worthy twist to the age-old ALIENS formula. You know the set-up, a spaceship-load of passengers crash land on a desolate planet system. Without the benefits of communication and refuge, they are forced to fight for their lives against the planets hostile inhabitants, this in case, ALIEN lookalikes.To benefit from the charisma of the lead character of the ALIEN films, PITCH BLACK also has a female heroine to lead the brigade of survivors. She's Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell) who assists a batch of plucky to bad-ass characters, including a convict named Riddick (Vin Diesel) who plays hero later on in the picture. They arrive on a bizarre world which has a strange weather condition: It's approaching a season where everything gets dark. The time where the planet's inhabitants, strange creeping Alien-types, start crawling out of their crawl-spaces and stalk everyone. You know the rest! There's not much plot to speak of, as the film goes on as a typical creature-feature then on. But the movie is not nearly as bad as it might be. Derivative enough, PITCH BLACK still satisfies as an enjoyable attraction, even as a simple time-passer. Diesel is a satisfying anti-hero, who actually proves he can act. He's cold and emotionless, but I guess that's a plus. There's no character development whatsoever, even if the film spends enough time with them. The plot is empty and derivative, but as a creature feature, the film is slick and enjoyable. Even if it's not quite as unbearably seat-gripping as those in ALIENS, Twohy manages to create suspense in the most unexpected of places. There's enough action and decent acting to provide a sufficiently enjoyable action fare.Rating: *** out of 5.",6,0,1,21 June 2008
Knowing," Finally, they made a good one!
","My Take: While the plot isn't great literature, There are some intriguing twists and some occasionally spooky moments.Finally, the movie that M. Night Shymalan might have made if he hadn't done the disappointing LADY IN THE WATER, and the movie Nicolas Cage should have made instead of abominations such as GHOST RIDER and THE WICKER MAN; A supernatural thriller dipped in science fiction and sprinkled with a little religiosity, KNOWING has in it to make it more than just a thriller in namesake. This time they did it right, even if there are some moments that 'jump the shark' as far as plot twists are concerned.The film opens in 1959, where students of William Dawes Elementary School were asked to sketch their own view of the future, which will then be stored inside a time capsule. While other students busily draw their own versions of futuristic automobiles and rocket ships, mentally disturbed Lucinda Embry (Lara Robinson) disturbingly writes a series of numbers which might be a numerical sequence of sorts. Forward 5 decades later, the time capsule is unearth during an annual school ceremony, where the drawings stored inside are distributed each to a new generation of students. Astrophysicist John Koestler (Cage) and his son Caleb (Chandler Canterbury) end up with Lucinda's work. what seems to be simply a set of randomly written numerals turns out to be a cryptic numerical list of every major disaster in the last decades, along with the number of casualties, in perfect sequence. See where we're getting here? Soon, Cage runs around in desperate attempt to warn everyone of the upcoming doom predicted in the code. But just when twists are starting to wear out, the script dishes out the usual 'big twist' that abandons the restrains of reality.Not that it matters. Under the hands of DARK CITY director Alex Proyas, any plot implausibilities and reality lapses are handled with some seriousness and poignancy that makes it sound less ridiculous than it really is. KNOWING may be a silly thriller if given in the hands of another somewhat lesser director, but Proyas does an adequate job that proves his up for the challenge. Cage is still less the actor he was in his better years, an aftertaste some of his previous efforts have left, but gives a rather adequate performance that goes way over the top in several laughable sequences, but does carry most of the film. Co-star Rose Byrne, who plays the disturbed Lucinda's daughter, is a good actress put to a lesser use in the movie (not even a love interest),. It may just be a case that the material is better than the people who act it out. The intriguing, sometimes screwy, plot is filled with interesting twists that, silly as they might get, come at you with some surprise that it still often startles somehow. There are a share of laughable moments that I'm perfectly aware of are supposed to be dead serious, but getting passed them, there are moments successfully pulled-off by Proyas. The special effects are terrific, sometimes frightening, but thankfully doesn't upstage the plot. Nic Cage fans (as in former Nic Cage fans) will be surprised and delighted. Basically, KNOWING is better in every aspect some of his earlier movies have miserably failed. Let's face it, KNOWING could have been (and may still be) another paycheck role for the once great Cage, but this time, in KNOWING, even we to get our money's worth.

Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Men and their 'Machines'.
","My Take: Lacks the originality of the first or the thrills of the second, but effective all the same. Third chapters are usually gamble, especially if you have a series that's as successful as the TERMINATOR saga. What started as a hit low-budget sci-fi thriller (in THE TERMINATOR) turns into one of the most explosive and expensive blockbuster of all time (in TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY). So what is there in store for audiences in TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF THE MACHINES. Not to terribly much I'm afraid, as the film falls under the category of 'been-there-done-that' for most of the scenes. Director James Cameron unfortunately leaves further involvement in this third film, and leaves the directorial reigns (as well much of the TERMINATOR legacy) to action director Jonathan Mostow, who isn't exactly a brand name a director. The new story (helmed by new batch of writers who are everything but James Cameron and Gale Ann Hurd).But regardless of its shortcomings, TERMINATOR 3 isn't a total loss as it might have turned out. While he rushes the screenplay for production, Mostow does offer a nicely done batch of action sequences and nifty special effects to keep one busy. There's much action here to satisfy the conventional action fan, be it chase scenes or wild gun-play action (maybe even both in one scene). Arnold Schwarzenegger (before running for governor of California) returns as the ever-present emotionless futuristic cyborg once again sent to protect John Conner (Nick Stahl), now a messed-up drifter, from yet another mechanical creation from Skynet sent to the past to kill him. For a change (whilst not much), the new machine, called the T-X, is takes the form of a chick (played by Kristanna Loken), which is just as unstoppable as its predecessor, other than that there's very little else new nor interestingly unique about this new killing machine. In addition, the big bad machine from the violent future must also protect Conner's would be wife (played by Claire Danes). Their connections with each other? They were classmates once! It doesn't get much more complicated than that, now does it? While the writing leaves much to be desired, and its anticlimax of an ending (of an anticlimax of a sequel by the way!) leaves us wondering why we had to go through the events of this film in the first place. One more thing, the much beloved characters of the ass-kicking woman warrior Sarah Conner is sorrily missed, almost as much as a payoff to the character of John Conner, who is a disappointment here in this film. Still, nonetheless, TERMINATOR 3 is a decent action thriller, packed with action and thrills. Leave our cynicism and brains at the door, it's brainless summer season again, and TERMINATOR 3 is a decent effort of pure mainstream film-making. It's disappointing, but only as sequel.Rating: *** out of 5.",6,0,0,13 July 2008
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Well, he said he'll be back.
","My Take: Highly superior to the original, with revolutionary special effects. The biggest, most explosive blockbuster of 1991 has finally arrived in TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY. Packed with non-stop action, explosive special effects, pumped-up heroics and surprisingly great writing, TERMINATOR 2 was and still remains one of the most explosive action pictures in years, far surpassing its somewhat dated 1984 predecessor. When he said he'll be back, he is back. Arnold Schwarzenegger returns as the emotionless, cold-blooded (or is that no-blooded) cyborg from the violent future, sent back to earth this time as a guardian assigned to protect Sarah Conner (Linda Hamilton) and his son John (Edward Furlong) against the nearly-unstoppable T-1000 (Robert Patrick), a deadly new machine with self-liquefying properties, and help stop computer genius from starting the deadly futuristic war, Judgment Day.The film has its share of minuses. Mostly there's Edward Furlong's fairly annoying portrayal of a street-hustling kid. His peace talk with the Terminator about not killing people is quite preachy and forced. But these few missteps are simply forgivable, considering that these are only 5 minutes (or so) worth of a mostly explosive 137 minutes that never lets up. Linda Hamilton's heroine is an improvement over the rather flat character of Sarah Conner from the original film. The new persona of her character is so much better, certainly the toughest butt-kicking female character since Sigourney Weaver's ass-kicking Rambo-with-breasts in ALIENS (also directed James Cameron). The special effects, which were revolutionary at the time, pale in comparison to today's highest achievements in special effects, but the T-1000 is still a triumph in special effects imagery.Sequels trying to be better than the original aren't actually successful at their attempts, but TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY doesn't just outdo its predecessor, but it still one of the better sequels Hollywood has produced, one that buries deeper to the story planted by the original instead of rehashing it. It's a perfect example of Cameron's accomplished talents.Rating: ***** out of 5.",10,1,2,13 July 2008
Edward Scissorhands," A beautiful and touching instant classic.
","My Take: An imaginative and touching classic. A burst of imagination as only Tim Burton can conceive. Before I was a movie buff, I thought that 'Edward Scissorhands' was a horror film, a counterpart of Freddy from 'The Nightmare on Elm Street' (Yeah!I really did). But when I finally watched many years later, I was surprised at how magical and magnificent it was. This film really should be in the classics list, a really wonderful movie it was. This was Tim Burton's first collaboration with Johnny Depp, which led to other film success like 'Ed Wood' and 'Sleepy Hollow'. But this was the best. Burton has never come up with a more fantastic that can surpass it. Johnny Depp really made his best performance, he should have won an Oscar for that.The rest of the cast including Winona Ryder, Dianne Weist, Alan Arkin and Vincent Price, in his final screen performance, give excellent support. Danny Elfman's music is outstanding and the settings and costumes are well done.This film is really great. So if your a movie collector, or simply a movie buff. Make sure you leave a space in the classics' row (and in your heart) for 'Edward Scissorhands'.Rating: ***** out of 5.",10,1,1,14 February 2007
Van Helsing," VAN HELSING: Monsters, action, horrible script.
","My Take: A dumb, but visually-stunning adventure with some neat action and some truly terrible dialog. If there's a weakness I have, it's how I keep changing my opinion on the movies I watch. I saw VAN HELSING back then, sort of liked it then forgot much about it. Since I have a vague memory of VAN HELSING since then, I just dismissed it as the CGI effects-laden mess that everyone else called. But upon seeing it again a few weeks ago, it fared much better than I expected. If I wrote about VAN HELSING back then, I would have given it the 3 stars I'm giving it now; It's enjoyable and occasionally exciting, but still pretty silly and quite forgettable.I didn't really grow up with the old Universal monster movies (these movie are even older than my parents are!), but their impact is undeniable. Whether or not you have seen all of those original B&W classics, you are maybe living under a rock or something if you don't even know who Dracula is. These guys are the big leagues! Our generation is grown up on movie serial killers and soulless slashers who have none of these immortals' depth or class; You can actually find something to identify with in these monsters. And here they are, all together in one movie, like a greatest hits collection strewn together like a Frankenstein's Monster. VAN HELSING's great B&W opening alone is a great homage to the classic monster movies and probably the best moment in the entire film.The rest is pretty much standard action-with-CGI fare. Van Helsing, an intelligent old hero in the old Dracula classics, is turned into a comic-book action hero here (played by Hugh Jackman) complete with gadgets, a comic-relief sidekick, a secret organization he works for (a secret Vatican organization with more James Bond 007 references you will ever need in a movie) and the girl. But regardless of his presence, Jackman could have done so much more to the role. The movie was pure intentional camp to be sure, the least Jackman should have done is to add more humor and edge to the character. Worse still is Kate Beckinsale (a fine actress, need I mention) who plays vampire hunter Anna Valerious. She shares very little chemistry with Jackman's Gabriel Van Helsing, while an adventure movie of this kind could have done so much more. Then there's the CGI, superior and all, is just a bit too overcrowded at times. Did the movie really need a CGI Dr Jekyll/Mr. Hyde? And don't get me started on Dracula's screeching overbearing wives who turn into flying bat-like creatures (which makes me wonder if the real actresses who played them weren't CGI characters themselves!).Director Stephen Sommers of THE MUMMY pictures could have made another purely enjoyable blockbuster, but this flawed, silly yet marginally entertaining one lacks the charm of his previous works. One thing I do remember enjoying in VAN HELSING is the action, and they're still pretty gripping this time around. Sometimes though, I wish that Sommers realize that CGI without a lot of fun in them are just lifeless. And that script, bleh! Rating: **1/2 out of 5.",5,1,1,12 September 2009
Face_Off," Trading 'Faces'.
","My Take: The mindless action movie for smart people. FACE/OFF is Hong Kong action director John Woo's 3rd Hollywood action effort, and it is in this one that he finally hits the stride. Woo deliver one heck of a punch and delivers one action scene after another...with style. FACE/OFF is action filmdom as an art form. There are many moments of violence and shootouts, but thanks to th very talented Woo, the action is in a style of his own. Slow-motion shots and all, FACE/OFF is not just a non-stop thrill machine that one quit for a second (from the opening credits to the seat-gripping climax, it hardly has time for small talk), it's also Woo's perfect ballet of style and violence. And if you think those to things don't go together, then you haven't seen FACE/OFF.Perhaps one of the two best actors at work in action films is John Travolta and Nicolas Cage, and they prove the pride of their work in this movie. During the film's gloomy prologue, nice-guy family man cop Sean Archer (Travolta) is on a carousel with his little boy, while on top of the hill is eccentric terrorist Castor Troy (Cage), aiming his sniper at Archer but misses, and hits his son instead. Since then, Archer has devoted himself on bringing Castor down. After two years or so, he's still at it. 'We'll take a break, when the case breaks!' Archer says angrily. When Archer does corner Castor in hi private plane (in one of the film's earliest action scenes), Archer brings Castor drop dead in a coma. Just when he thought it was over, secretly Castor and his brother Pullox (Alessandro Nivola) has already set up a bomb and Castor's brother, captured for interrogation, just won't talk. What does he do? Well, here it goes. Archer has to switch faces with the comatose Castor, go to prison with Pullox and make him talk. Oh! And he also must remain undercover. No one knows, even his wife Eve (Joan Allen), of the operation. Things get worse when Castor wakes up (!) from his comatose and asks for Archer's face. Silly plot as it is, but who cares. This give us a chance to see the good guy Travolta and bad guy Cage switch personalities for most of the film.What else is good about FACE/OFF is how the characters are well-developed. Archer is a nice cop, but isn't the same as a husband and a father, as he is unable to handle his relationship with his wife and rebellious daughter Jamie (Dominique Swann). Castor Troy is what he is, a real villain everyone loves to hate. The supporting characters are surprisingly well-developed and interesting. We care about these batch of characters, more or less it's the action we want, and it's more than we get. The action scenes here, including the opening action fireworks and the boat chase climax is a seat-gripper. Then there's a number of shoot-outs and fist-fights that, under the style of Woo, is like a ballad... with guns and punches. FACE/OFF is action movies of the best order. It's one of the best action movies in years.Rating: ***** out of 5.",10,3,4,15 May 2008
Spider-Man," It's got its web on me.
","My Take: A challenging comic-book summer blockbuster with all the thrills you have come to expect, and more. There's much buzz about this movie before it was released, and even if I unfortunately missed the film in its theatrical release, I managed to catch up. SPIDER-MAN is the ideal summer blockbuster, and the fact that this film was a highly-praised summer attraction is understandable. Packed with state-of-the-art special effects creations that parade in front of the screen like magic, but also powered by a great story and a sharp focus on characters, SPIDER-MAN is a web of gold.Tobey Maguire is ideally cast as Peter Parker who, after being bit by the radioactive spider, is turned from ultimate nerd into the ultimate superhero of the title, but you all know that. But the film makes everything else interesting for the audience. Instead of being just your fairly typical summer event picture, living it up with special effects alone, this one actually has a story to boot, and interesting characters ranging from Parker, his family and the villain, Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe), who turns into the evil Green Goblin. Director Sam Raimi doesn't dumb this one down as a visually exhilarating and incompetently plot-less summer picture. What SPIDER-MAN turns up to be is a terrific roller-coaster ride of an adventure, which gives audiences have much to think about.Although the sum of the parts are often uneven, SPIDER-MAN is still a wild ride of a summer movie that'll knock your socks off. And yes, it does live up to its hype.Rating: **** out of 5.",8,1,2,5 July 2008
Shrek Forever After," As happily ever after's go, this one ain't half bad.
","The final chapter in the SHREK series recalls that familiar term 'Be careful what you with for'. I too was careful at what I wished SHREK FOREVER AFTER would be. After the disappointing SHREK THE THIRD, the bar isn't set high for this supposedly final chapter. It's never going to compare with the superior first two, but if Dreamworks Animation really wanted to conclude their beloved property with this, they might as well give it all that it has. SHREK FOREVER AFTER, while certainly more elaborate than its immediate predecessor, is not the most original of the series, but if this is really a happily ever after for Shrek, at least he went out on a good note rather than a disappointing one.The story is basically IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE with Shrek (voiced by Mike Myers) trading places with George Bailey. Shrek's life couldn't be better: he has his loving wife Fiona (voiced by Cameron Diaz) and three kids, best buddies Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and Puss (Antonio Banderas) are current visitors, he's got his swamp back, and above all his days as the flesh-eating ogre are way behind him. But everyday of the same day-to-day rituals can get too routine for our big green ogre. If only he could wish he could be that flesh-eating ogre again! His wish is granted when he meets the crafty Rumpelstiltskin (voiced by Walt Dohrn), but it at a terrible catch. Before you can say 'Happily Ever After no more!', Shrek is trapped in a depressing alternate universe where he was never born and none of his pals know who he is.The real treat of the premise of FOREVER AFTER is that it gives us a chance to warm up with these characters again and recall why we loved them in the first place, and then find out a few new reasons to like them all over again. We already know these characters and we have met them before, and this might just serve as a reunion after the occasional slog of the previous follow-up. Unlike its immediate predecessor as well, this one actual has a storyline instead of the simple premise to be used to hang pop culture reference and in-jokes. It's not a great storyline and certainly not anything original, but it's a step on the right direction. Director Mike Mitchell has at least put Shrek right back on track, and not a moment too soon. If this is really the series' finale, the creators have at least done a credible job at reminding us of the appeal that these characters. In a way, SHREK FOREVER AFTER is a satisfying conclusion, if not a grand one.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",7,12,13,11 June 2010
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Darker, deeper and better. The best 'Potter' so far.
","My Take: The best of the novels come to the screen as the best of the blockbusters. Even as an avid fan of J.K. Rowling's bestselling enterprise that took the teenage generation by storm, I wasn't able to read the first two books in the series before having seen the movies, which were instant blockbuster attractions at their best. HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN was the only book in the series I have read so far, and the film adaptation, directed by acclaimed director Alfonso Cauron (1995's THE LITTLE PRINCESS), is the best and most entertaining of the series so far (even with the inclusion of later chapters GOBLET OF FIRE and ORDER OF THE PHOENIX). All from the brilliant characters, exuberant special effects and elaborate plot twists, PRISONER OF AZKABAN offers it all in yet another involving and intriguing fantasy adventure. It's Harry's (Daniel Radcliffe) third year in Hogwarts, and its gloomier this time around (and not just because Cauron gave Hogwarts a gloomier makeover). Harry, along with his friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) are thrown in to a gloomier adventure shrouded with peril and mystery when a convicted murderer named Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped from the 'inescapable' Azkaban prison with rumors all pointing to his vengeance on Harry and his family. See, Black is supposed to be the evil Voldemort's (aka 'He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named') shady accomplice who led him to killing Harry's parents, but I bet you all know that. Harry wants to avenge his parents death of course, but the plot grows thicker than that and they (and you) are thrown into a bigger, more exciting adventure than you expected.The characters are as attractive as ever and the special effects are more seamless, but what makes AZKABAN superior to the previous films (which are both still grand in fashion) is the darker, more efficient directorial approach by Cauron. Filling in from his predecessor Chris Colombus, Cauron does everything Colombus has offered us in the previous films with the addition of a whole lot more. Although I feel that comparing this both Cauron and his predecessor Colombus give their own style to their own adaptations, I agree with other critics saying the film as the one that definitely doesn't feel like reading the books in style (not that I felt both previous movies, which I loved, felt like on-screen book-reading). Cauron isn't afraid to risk a little from the fans by altering some elements from the book, making the film much more than an impressive adaptation but a perfect stand-alone effort that would be more pleasant and fitful to the series' non-fans. HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN is the kind of movie the words 'movie magic' is meant for. Rating: ***** out of 5.",10,0,1,22 December 2008
Aliens," The darn best monster movie of all time! (includes Special Edition DVD review)
","My Take: Takes the already remarkable concept of the original and improves upon it in every way. Sequels have never been this great!(This is an extension of the review I wrote on February 2007)If ALIEN was the 2001 of monster movies, its sequel ALIENS is its STAR WARS. Here's a sequel that knows that the only thing that would satisfy its fans is to give 'em exactly what they wanted. Then ALIENS adds in a little more to that successful recipe: breathless action, gripping tension, reliable characters and the slimiest monsters in all of movie history. The result isn't only a sequel that's better than the original, its one of the best movies of the genre.Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) reawakened from here naturally-long hypersleep which began at the finale of the first ALIEN. Forward 57 years later. The world she knew was unlike anything she has seen before, but she really has no time to know anything else than this: the distant planet LV-426, the planet where they encountered the hostile space killer, has been colonized. And when communication on the LV-426 colony is lost, Ripley agrees to return to the hostile alien planet, this time, accompanied by marines, to investigate the sudden communication loss. Of course, this ain't just a technical failure. The slimy alien from the first film times 10 has overrun the colony, turning in into a dark, gooey wasteland; the perfect place for an all-out war that pits top-tech Marines against the slimiest monsters ever.As a monster movie, ALIENS gives you your due, but not contented simply to give you your money's worth, ALIENS offers more, unexpected surprises. For a monster picture, there are some genuinely pleasant characters existing here. Sigourney Weaver, who hit big time for being the most reliable female action heroine in the original ALIEN, is able to stretch the personality of her character here. This time, we are able to see Ripley's maternal instincts when she claims responsibility for the safety of Newt (Carrie Henn), a little girl who has successfully survived the apocalypse of the outside world she lives in by climbing through hidden ducts. The climax inside the exploding atmosphere processing station won't soon be forgotten, and I'm not just talking about the explosions. In fact, I bet ALIENS is one kind of film you won't soon forget. Not the words you drop on an explosive monster movie.Rating: ***** out of 5.154-min Special Edition DVD review (submitted March 10, 2009): And to think, I thought ALIENS was good enough as it is! This Special Edition DVD, which I bought a few days ago, is everything this ALIENS fan could ever want. 17 minutes of additional footage, deleted prior to the films original 1986 release, is added in able to deepen the emotions and character development of this terrific film, while it also adds an additional (though easily expendable) action scene. The first added scene shows the newly awakened Ripley discovering that her daughter has just died... at the age of 60. So much for being there on her 11th birthday. But the scene everyone will get a real kick from is the scene where we catch a glimpse of the LV-426 colony before it is overrun by aliens, as well as a look on Newt and her family. Another scene has Ripley and Hicks exchange first names, which deepens the relationship between them. Add to that, there are a few extended scenes on the Sulaco and the Colony stations, as well as the aforementioned action scene which has the aliens cleverly trying to pass through the barricade of automatic weapons. Then of course, the film is presented in a clear, pristine transfer which makes the film look good for something released back in 1986. The special features aren't big, but if the best possible way to see this modern classic is what I'm looking for, I already got my end of the bargain.",10,11,18,20 February 2007
The Exorcist," A winner in any version.
","My Take: In any version available, THE EXORCIST maintains tension, shocks and indisputable drama. Even famous horror icons of today like 'The Ring', 'The Grudge' and even the prequel 'Exorcist:The Beginning' is inept to 'The Exorcist'. Even through all this years, even in these times where 'horror' means more gore than story, it's still very convincing.The Performances are excellent. Ellen Burstyn, Max Von Sydow, Lee J. Cobb and Jason miller give performances that deeply highlights the story's essence. But Linda Blair is the real star of the show as the possessed girl of the story, a role that she will be deeply remembered.The script is well pressed into William Peter Blatty's superb novel. While William Friedkin directs with great talent and creativity.This film really deserves its title as the 'scariest movie of all time.'. 'The Exorcist' really deserves to be the highest-rated movie in the horror genre.The film is either distributed on DVD on a restored original format or the 'Version You've Never Seen'. But in any way, both versions sum up an excellent movie that has, well, words hardly can explain.Rating: ***** out of 5.",10,2,3,6 February 2007
Spirited Away," 'Japan beats Disney with this mature version of 'Alice in Wonderland'.'
","My Take: Imagination (and animation) at its best. I have grown up watching Disney films, even now, I still watch some. So I was startled when I watched this animated fantasy film, which was more aimed on older viewers. The borrowed the English-dubbed version, and it was still great. The film is an adult-oriented version of Lewis Carroll's tale 'Alice in Wonderland', wherein a little girl is transported to a world of weird and wonderful spirits, after her parents have been turned into pigs by a witch after they intruded their world. For her parents to be turned back into their human forms, she is forced to work on a spirit bathhouse, run by the witch who turned his parents into pigs.The animation was superb and the story was excellent. In any version you want, I recommend you to watch it. With the kids, or by yourself. Really a superb fantasy.Rating: ***** out of 5.",10,0,0,24 February 2007
Pearl Harbor," Not as bad as they say.
","My take: An expensive, old-fashioned epic rather than the historical event it promises. Not nearly as bad as critics have reported.Since its release and up until now, Bay and Bruckheimer's version of 'the day which will live in infamy' remains much-maligned and heavily criticized. Sure it's melodramatic. Sure it's about as accurate as a kid playing with toy planes and boats in a bathtub. But I thought PEARL HARBOR, as an old-fashioned melodrama set on a historical event, is an entertaining romp, depending how you look at it. Despite Bay's self-importance, PEARL HARBOR is a gorgeous, visually-stunning, unashamedly clichéd and old-fashioned epic that, while a mile away from perfection, is also a mile away from what critics make it look. Where else could you possibly still hear such dialogs as '...And then I kissed him' or 'I'll be back for you'? Where else could you have a love story as complicated as a love triangle about two young pilots who both fall in love with the same girl, a nurse, amidst their duties in the impending war? How many movies still give as that gung-ho action as planes who go 'woosh!!' in the air, chasing and gunning each other down? PEARL HARBOR offers them all, the old-fashioned way. It gets trite and cliché in doing so, but I think that's just part of fun.Like its obvious inspiration, James Cameron's mega-hit TITANIC, the movie is cut into two parts. The first act involves a love story, in this case a ménage à trois involving crack air pilot Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck), hopelessly devoted to gorgeous nurse Evelyn Johnson (Kate Beckinsale), who volunteers to fight in the Eagle Squadron in England. Unfortunately his plane is shot down in the Battle of Britain is he's reported dead, much to the mourning of poor Evelyn, while Rafe's best buddy Danny (Josh Hartnett) provides her comfort. Will these two end up together? Well, after they cuddle in a parachute hangar, indeed they do, much to the anger of Rafe, who turns up alive and seeing his girl in the loving hands of his best buddy.But they really have no time to argue when history interrupts. Japanese Zeroes swoop down in the harbor on the morning of December 7, 1941, having been devised few days earlier by Admiral Yamamoto (Mako), who's famous line of dialog ('I fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant.') is only briefly mentioned here. The attack itself is immense, delivering all the explosions, disaster and trauma of the actual attack, only with neat CGI planes and sinking battleships. But just when the movie should have ended at this point, the movie throws in an additional hour devoted to the Tokyo Raid led by Lt. Col. Dolittle (Alec Baldwin, in a clichéd but acceptable role). Running nearly as long as 3 hours (or more!), PEARL HARBOR really doesn't need the extra hour, even if it just for the sake of ending the film on a happy note.But despite the prolonged running time, PEARL HARBOR just about gave me my money's worth. It's a terrific turn on the old 1940's romance movies (as Bay describes it). It's sappy, melodramatic and a bit cliché, but entertaining as whole. The performances were adequate, with Affleck and Hartnett playing bland yet reliable cocky heroes. But Beckinsale deserves some praise who looks and acts like a classic beauty, something that would be right at home with an old-fashioned lover story. Jon Voight momentarily appears as wheelchair-bound President Franklin D. Roosevelt, but goes way over the top in a scene where he literally stands in his own two feet, despite the fact that he was affected by polio. Cuba Gooding Jr. lands an important role that's reduced simply as an extended cameo while Baldwin and Colm Feore play clichéd roles of real flesh-and-blood historical figures. But what it lacks in human and character dimension, it makes up in pure spectacle. The special effects are breathtaking and the production design is spectacular. Hans Zimmer's score is adequate to the film's dramatic and patriotic tones (with the addition of Faith Hill's theme song 'There You'll Be', there are guaranteed misty eyes while the credits roll).There are definitely better films about Pearl Harbor, including an accurate one (TORA! TORA! TORA!) and a similarly dramatic one (FROM HERE TO ETERNITY). But just because there are even better choices doesn't mean the lesser one's make bad choices. PEARL HARBOR, while never going to be on the same league as the said films, is still an enjoyable piece of 'they don't make 'em like this anymore' entertainment. For accuracy, go see TORA! TORA! TORA! But for pure, old-fashioned entertainment, PEARL HARBOR just about gives me what I have paid for.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",7,1,4,13 March 2009
Tropic Thunder," The funniest movie of the post-DARK KNIGHT season.
","My Take: A hilarious and satirical affair. The best in acquired taste has to offer. After a couple of fake trailers have graced the screen to start the film, I knew I was in for, not just a different comedy, but a different movie-going experience. Although the mention of Ben Stiller and Jack Black are quite like warnings to stay away and the film is released much later than it should have, TROPIC THUNDER is a riot, and that's a surprise despite all the red-herrings. This not just Ben Stiller's funniest to date (In acting or directing) or the funniest comedy in a while, it's also, so far, the best movie ever to be released in the post-DARK KNIGHT season.For those who has been living under a rock for a long time (or just so recently), THE DARK KNIGHT is, undoubtedly, the biggest movie in a long time. Critics and local audiences have dug into the film (sometimes more than once) and devoured the film until after a month or two. This paved way to a series of rescheduling for many other movie releases, most of which rescheduled for next year. In the meantime, this so-called post-DARK KNIGHT season (or so I call it) is the time studios dump in most of the features they couldn't release to compete with THE DARK KNIGHT's big numbers. Regardless of a few anticipated releases (a big screen adaptation of Stephanie Meyer's TWILIGHT will be around your multiplexes by November), most of the movies released at the time are just minor efforts, meaning their not 'event' pictures. Even Hollywood needs its rest you know! So don't be so surprised not to see much long lines after opening nights and the night after. Despite a few hits, none of them are truly real 'big' movies. You can expect those sometime next year. But, in the meantime, TROPIC THUNDER will satisfy your quench for entertaining movie-going experience. It may just be the funniest movie of the summer, with one of the biggest laughs I ever had since...well, a very long time. That's because TROPIC THUNDER isn't some ordinary summer comedy. It's a clever and biting satire of the Hollywood tycoon. Although the main targets are the challenges of making war movies, it takes on apparently anything about the movie-making business. You name it: narcissistic actors, rookie directors, Hollywood's obsession with explosions and violence, event pictures, celebrity scandals, the Oscars and everything you can dig up on your Entertainment Weekly magazine and more. TROPIC THUNDER is not the first film attempting to do this job, but the good thing about it is that it doesn't do the job lazily. It doesn't just display the references, it attacks them directly. From referencing movies, quotes and celebs, TROPIC THUNDER doesn't chicken out in its assault at the Hollywood movie-making business.Ben Stiller and Jack Black are at their best playing two big-shot actors in desperate need for a career change. They do so, and so much more. Steve Coogan is hilarious as the rookie film director incapable of handling the big-named actors and the heavy demands of his production studio (including Tom Cruise's effectively hilarious performance as the raunchy film exec). But in the end, Robert Downey Jr. steals the show in yet another talked-about performance as Australian Oscar-winner Kirk Lazarus, who receives dozens of controversies when he underwent surgery to play a black character in his next movie. Playing what might be one of the most offensive character ever put on screen, Downey proves once again that he's one of the screen's finest actors today. He's capable of any character that demands him to be a complete oddball.I'm quit sure not everyone will apply to TROPIC THUNDER. I'm sure some might find that Stiller has pushed it too far. But to everyone else (and I mean everybody), this is the moment they've been waiting for. It's all clear folks, it's safe to be a Ben Stiller fan again.Rating: **** out of 5.",8,1,2,25 October 2008
Enchanted," 'Enchanted' Amy, and the movie is a fairy tale come true!
","My Take: A very familiar fish-out-of-water Disney musical, but with great tunes, loving touches and an appealing performance by Amy Adams.The Disney studios has done a long strain of mediocre to terminally bad works for such a time. Be it the banal THE WILD or the insufferable CHICKEN LITTLE, Disney might have hit rock bottom as far as the studio is concerned. But, after a long exhausting line of 'Oh, boy!' efforts, I approached ENCHANTED with very low expectations. When I saw the posters for the film, I let out a small sigh of hopelessness that Disney will ever get out of its mediocre status. But when the film started to stir up a buzz, I was forced to get sucked into this immediately. The critics praised the film as 'sweet' and 'refreshing'. The Tomatometer at Rotten Tomatoes.com ranked it with, not just a passable, but a high rating of 93%. Pretty high for a simple film like this, but I took the time to see this film on video after missing it on the big screen.The film opens with an animated sequence, which was just as awful as I'd expect. The animation sequence was lacking in anything I liked about Disney. By this point, I was about to give up. I was glad I didn't! After the tiresome animated opening, the movie evolves into a sweet, funny and often refreshing rom-com, in fact much more entertaining than most I've seen in years. It's also satisfies as the best Disney movie in a long time, and it's really been a long time, so it's worth seeing.Perhaps one of the main reasons why the movie makes a terrific return to form is the return of Academy Award-winning composer Alan Menken, who serves up a series of energetic and lovable musical numbers and lavish songs to come along with it. Other than that, the real star of the film is Amy Adams as the fish-out-of-water Princess Giselle. Fans might remember her from her Oscar-nominated performance from JUNEBUG, which earned the hearts of critics. Her performance here is another winner. In fact, she carries the entire movie right along her winsome and blissful performance as a clueless princess, kicked out from her candy-coated paradise and transported into the world without any happily ever afters, modern New York City. Patrick Dempsey plays the divorce lawyer who comes to her aid, much to the insistence of his princess-loving daughter (Rachel Covey). On the other hand, Giselle's true husband-to-be Prince Edward (A surprisingly joyous James Marsden) goes down the same well and arrives in New York in search of his beloved (in one scene, Edward points a sword to a construction worker and says 'I seek a beautiful girl!'. The worker replies 'I'd like to find one of them too!') Supporting performances by Timothy Spall as Edward's right-hand man Nathaniel who apparently happens to work with an evil witch (a rarely-used Susan Sarandon), who also happens to be Edward's evil stepmother who wants to prevent her son to get married. Among the other pleasures of the film is the twists on their old fashioned fairy tales. Like, for example, Nathaniel tries to poison Giselle with three poisoned apples in many of outrageous ways (namely, caramel apples on a stick, apple martini). The good thing about the film is that it's so joyous and blissful that audiences are guaranteed to smile at the thing for it's entire running time. And if that's all I can ask in a movie like ENCHANTED (I guess it really is), then Disney delivers immensely. Rating: **** out of 5.",8,2,2,18 October 2008
Die Hard 2," It's a non-stop seat-gripper that won't quit until it has ignited enough spark for two action films.
","My Take: Just as good, if better, than the original. I thought the first 'Die Hard' film was an enjoyable and energetic thrill ride. So with such a success, isn't it time for a sequel. Yes, 'Die Hard 2' was born, released mere years after the original. This action sequel reunites Bruce Willis with his role, John McLane, from the first film. I think that 'Die Hard 2', subtitled 'die harder', is among the films I'd classify as the 'Great Action Movies', a group of well-made action films that, to me, acts like a roller-coaster ride, making you wish that the theater would apply a seat belt buckle on your seat. Definitely it's on the par with other action films like the 'Indy Jones' series, 'Lethal Weapon' films, and the first 'Die Hard'. Actually, I think this is more enjoyable than the first film, but still shares the non-stop thrills and wall-to-wall action of its predecessor. It's a non-stop seat gripper that won't quit until it has ignited enough spark for two action films.As said, Willis returns as hero McLane, on a Washington airport, waiting for his wife's plane to depart. The plane that his wife (Bonnie Bedelia) is on board, is on of the planes that are circling around the airport, desperately delayed from their landing time. But things are about to get stickier when terrorists, led by Col. Stuart (William Sadler), a former government agent turned double-crosser, seize control of the airport's tower, and threaten to crash the beleaguered planes circling above. While already faced with a few problems, including a stubborn airport security (Dennis Franz), a hard-headed government specialist (John Amos), and his wife's plane desperately running out of fuel, McLane starts another all-out war against the mercenaries, and what follows is a thrill-packed adrenaline rush, that wouldn't have been possible, if not gifted with talented direction and superb action sequences.But the film isn't just good for that, 'Die Hard2' is one of those very few sequels to great films that actually live up. or maybe better than their predecessor. This one did, and I more than appreciate it for that and so much more. Willis is always a charm as a strong, action hero that can make a charm to his role more than once. Director Renny Harlin keeps the film in a roaring pace that keeps on going and going until the credits roll. It's not at all easy to put up a sequel to a blockbuster film, and it's more of a challenge if your objective is to top the predecessor. But, well, they did. And, boy, did they do it right!

Independence Day," The definitive summer blockbuster.
","My Take: Perfection in its own silly, explosive, action-packed way. A highly entertaining blockbuster. I love the summer. It's the time every year or so, that we could sit back, relax and try to get back to your lazy self. You can go outside, fly kites, ride your bike across the countryside, go to the beach, stay at home and watch television, or go to the theaters and catch the latest in summer blockbuster releases. It was way back in the 1990's that these blockbuster flourished. It was almost every year or so, we get a film that tried to top the other. It was the busiest time for Hollywood.I wasn't much frequent on watching movies on the big screen back then, and only manage to watch these movies on video. I watched INDEPENDENCE DAY many years later, having missed it on both its exact release date and decade. I saw it on a post-summer night, just a few weeks after summer vacation just ended. Upon watching, I found myself enjoying everything about it. Rating it on a summer movie meter, it's terrific entertainment. The definitive summer blockbuster.INDEPENDENCE DAY has no moment to spare. It starts out quickly with the sight of a gigantic alien spaceship hovering over the craters of the moon, heading towards the Earth. The film has the usual news on Earth, like all invasion flicks, having the news spread, starting from a small organization investigating extraterrestrial activity, then to the military, who then phone calls The White House, giving it full news to President Thomas Whitmore (Bill Pullman), who obviously remembers Michael Douglas' president performance in THE American PRESIDENT (but I didn't say lampoon), who stares in a moment of shock and disbelief.Before the sight of the alien spaceship hovering above the cities around the world, we first get a glimpse of the many characters in the film. First, there's computer engineer David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum, in an excellent performance), playing chess with father Julius Levinson(Judd Hirsh) at Central Park. David is divorced from his wife (Margaret Colin), who happens to be the President's Chief-of-staff (see the connections). Then it switches to Kansas, where the focus is a small family. The father, Russell Casse (Randy Quaid), a crop-dust farmer, believes he's kidnapped by aliens and is willing for payback, much to the dismay of his teenage kids. We also get introduced to a soldier (Will Smith), who both longs to return to NASA and reach for the stars (literally), and to propose to his girlfriend Jasmine (Vivica A. Fox).Well, enough of that. It's time we see an invasion, and, boy, did we get one. After the discovery of the invaders plot (using the Earth's satellites to plan an attack), we get a mind-blowing sequence after another at incredible pace. The destruction at the streets of New York are just the first great effects-laden sequences in the film. Lets see, we get a STAR WARS-inspired dogfight between fighter jets and alien spaceships. And we also get a suspenseful sequence of an alien in laboratory (Talk about a close encounter), INDEPENDENCE DAY doesn't fail when it comes to a good visual feast. Admittedly, some of the effects are cheesy, seeing how much CGI has improved over the years, but they still provide an eye-filling experience.INDEPENDENCE DAY runs for a long 145 minutes, but director Roland Emmerich fills it with lots of fun and excitement, it just seems to pass by. Director Emmerich and producer Dean Devlin spares no moments and doesn't stop for a break, giving the film a roaring pace without a dull moment that can't be interesting. The photography by Karl Walter Lindenlaub gives the film a good look, while composer David Arnold serenades the film with a rollicking and patriotic score.Forget its stereotype problems, INDEPENDENCE DAY is terrific summer entertainment that never fails to have me entertained.Rating: ***** out of 5.",10,43,82,26 September 2007
Alien vs. Predator," I'm a fan... and I hated it!
","My Take: Good special effects can't save this crappy AVP.Honestly, I am a big fan of the 'Alien' films. I remember watching 'Aliens', the 2nd in the series, and really enjoyed it, so what do I do? Watch it over and over again. Easy for you to say that it was one of my favorite films of all time, but too me, 'Aliens' was a lot more, as in other films I consider 'the best'. I like 'Alien', 'Alien 3' and 'Alien: Resurrection' too. I wasn't as much of a fan of the 'Predator' films though, but I think the 2 films were awesome action adventure/sci-fi hybrids. So with all the facts mentioned, it's easy to say I'll be enjoying 'AVP' that much as I did with the originals. But sad to say, I didn't. In fact, what a letdown! Well, as much as I'd expect or as I did with the originals. Why? That's it, it's pretty hard to say how such a film that aims so low still falls short of the mark. Was it the story? Well, the story was about a group of renowned adventurers and explorers summoned by billionaire Charles Bishop-Wieland (the man who designed an android version of himself to hide his identity in two of the 'Alien' films) to join an expedition in Antarctica to investigate an Aztec pyramid, which sent them a mysterious message. So was it the story? Was it the acting? Sanaa Lathan was the lead actress who, by any chances, makes an alliance with a Predator to fight the Aliens to hell. She was pretty heroic, but her acting, not much Sigourney Weaver-like heroic. The rest of the supporting cast was a mechanical and awfully boring (both characters and acting), for a lackluster film as this. So was it the acting? Or how about the over-abundance on special-effects and under-emphasis on a better plot? Well, that may be the biggest explanation, but was it the element that screws this all up? Perhaps it's a little bit of all the wrong things about this movie that left me totally disappointed. It's a movie about Aliens battling it out against Predators! Who could you screw that up? But don't let my comment stop you from showing this to the kids. They may be the ones who'd enjoy it (anyway, it is PG-13 so why not?). It's pretty hard not to like a package that offers you two of your favorite film creatures facing-off, but it is easy to mention the bad things about this so-called 'film' (in my opinion, it's on the wrong threshold between movies and video games). Bad acting and bad plotting. I am a fan of the ALIEN series, and I did like the two PREDATOR films, but AVP is still a total letdown, and for those who haven't seen a single ALIEN or PREDATOR film, it's still bad enough for you. In fact it may just get worse than it is.Rating: * out of 5.",2,1,2,22 March 2007
The Love Guru," Myers has lost his mojo. Or does he call it his 'karma' now?
","My Take: Too much shock humor but not any real laughs; there's very little show of Myers talents here.Although we all know him by name, we really got to know Mike Myers not from his name but from the name of the characters he plays. In fact, if his name wasn't so prominent in the credits, we would get to know him as the guy who played Austin Powers, Dr. Evil, Wayne, as well as the voice of Shrek. Bu recently, the characters he plays are like retreads of his old acts. First there's THE CAT IN THE HAT, which didn't really go so well. And now here's THE LOVE GURU. Well, Myers is still the best thing about THE LOVE GURU, but he can't save it. Not only is his act unoriginal, Myers tries to throw in every single sex joke or gross-out humor and see which one sticks.Myers plays his most forgettable character yet as Guru Pitka aka Maurice, who plays every single joke in the Mike Myers' book. From the witty word play and the funny accents, there's not much more original in this act that all he does is paint-by-numbers. I give credit, however, to Myers for doing whatever he can with the character and does score maybe a few puns. Now ask yourself how good those puns are compared to those that don't work? Guys hitting each other with mops covered in pee? Ben Kingsley being awful as Maurice's cross-eyed guru? An elephant sex scene? I'm beginning to wonder if I was watching a comedy or a test of endurance. It's as if the movie already wants you to leave by the 15-minute mark, and this movie is supposed to be mercifully short with an 87-minute running time.Everyone else in the supporting cast is embarrassing; funny thing is they seem to enjoy doing so. Jessica Alba, who seems to like appearing in every bad film her agent gets her into, is your typical love interest. Justin Timberlake gives an awful performance in an awful excuse of a comical character. And the list goes on, with some truly unnecessary cameos by Stephen Colbert, Val Kilmer, Jessica Simpson, and Kanye West. Besides perhaps a few witty word puns and some shtick about a moving remote control pillow (hey, there's got to be one scene I laughed in, but I just can't recall), THE LOVE GURU is quite an unfunny disaster, but I don't want to bring down Myers' spirit. Mike Myers, you're still funny, just stop making these movies.Rating: * out of 5.",2,1,6,19 February 2010
Mamma Mia!," 'My, my, how could I resist you?'.
","My Take: ABBA's music is irresistible... And so is this movie. (May I just remind the reader than I wasn't really an ABBA fan, and have I seen the stage musical, nor was I aware there even was one).I was lucky to have seen MAMMA MIA! before it was pushed out of the limelight by bigger blockbusters. Beaten by THE DARK KNIGHT and cleared to make way for other must-see blockbusters including the new MUMMY movie, the long-anticipated X-FILES: I WANT TO BELIEVE or the up and coming animated STAR WARS film, MAMMA MIA! has gone past its prime. I was lucky, later thankful, to have seen it. For not only is MAMMA MIA! a great time, it may be one of the best films I have seen this year since I walked into the new DARK KNIGHT. But while the new Batman movie riveted me and kept me on the edge of my seat, MAMMA MIA! had me joyously entertained and never wiped that smile off my face. Had I overlooked this film, I would have missed one of the best times I had in a theater this year so far.The story is a simple one: American island girl Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) is getting married to her boyfriend Sky (Dominic Cooper). Everything is ready, set before her by her loving and spunky mother Donna (Meryl Streep, brilliant as always), save one thing: Sophie wants her long-lost father to walk her up the isle. Trouble is, she doesn't know who he is. So she finds her mom's diary, looking up who dear ol' daddy could be. Turns out, her mom has date three guys in her young life. Unknown which one could be his father, he invites all three of them to her beautiful scenic island home (a wonderful setting by the way) to attend the wedding. Once Donna, who left those vigorous and spunky teenage life, discovers that her ex's (Pierce Brosnan, Stellan Skarsgaard and Colin Firth, respectively) are on the island, sheer delight ensues. While still pretty close with the Brosnan character, there's still no telling who the real dad is.But who cares! The plot is endearing and simple, but it's the musical numbers of the highest order that keeps me smiling all throughout. From Ms. Streep not seemingly uttering a flaw in her performance of the title song to the film's most energetic number: Streep and co-stars Christine Baranski and Julie Walters performing 'Dancing Queen'. Agreed, not everyone one of the casts can sing as great as the last one. Basically, there's Pierce Brosnan, who's James Bond charisma is simply flawed here once we hear him finally sings to the rhythms of 'SOS'. He's not bad, but needs more singing lessons. But I think that pretty much sums up the very few flaws I had with MAMMA MIA!, and that's hardly a big deal. It's these movies that I recommend anyone to see (even for the PG-13 rating, this film's pretty harmless and always joyous). It's a date flick, could pass as a family flick, but to simply sum it up, it's an entertaining flick. The performances (be it musical or acting) are especially superb. Streep, as always, is a reliable actress who gives yet another stand-out performance, this time demanding more spunk, and she doesn't slip it. Blooming star Amanda Seyfried is one of the best singers throughout the picture, and she has the makings to become a fine actress. Male co-stars Brosnan, Firth, Skarsgaard are especially good and delightful (while not the best singers in the film), but most of all, there's co-stars Christine Baranski and Julie Walters, providing excellent and energetic support as Donna's posse'.MAMMA MIA! is a great film I enjoyed to have seen before it struts away behind other bigger blockbusters (which in think, expect for THE DARK KNIGHT, are easily topped by this film). It's pleasant, often clever, tuneful and dot, dot, dot! Rating: ***** out of 5.",10,0,1,14 August 2008
Batman Begins," The man behind the 'Bat'.
","My Take: Darker, more menacing than any of the earlier BATMAN films. After Joel Schumacher brought back the pure camp of the dated 60's Batman series with his painfully annoying BATMAN & ROBIN, brilliant director Christopher Nolan gives us back the Batman we'd wish to come back. Nolan gives Batman a new breath of fresh air, maybe more than what Burton has given in his two brilliant Batman episodes BATMAN and BATMAN RETURNS (which still stands out as my favorite Batman movie). BATMAN BEGINS is less about the superhero junkie and more on his human side, which means it devotes more on dialog, character development and gritty action than the usual fantasy that we got to know. This is not the Batman for kids, but any fan of the dark knight will still be rewarded by the overall impact. This is looking through beyond the Bat suit and into the characters past.Christian Bale makes an ideal Batman, but most of all, he makes an ideal Bruce Wayne. And since the film is more about Bruce's life, his performance is potent and believable. The film also shows us that Bruce isn't exactly the instant heir to the Wayne fortune after his parents untimely murder. We discovered that he first becomes a prisoner due to a hard fight to survive. After which, he is trained by the mysterious League of Shadows, a sacred legion devoting themselves to fight injustice in a vigilante mannerism. After refusing to accept their justice, Bruce goes his own way, taking his deepest, darkest fear (the fear of bats) as his symbol to fight crime and injustice in the crime-drugged streets of Gotham city, ruled by underground drug-lords and crime-boss.The film is less the fun, and is very serious, but this is pulp fiction at best. The film's change of pace is necessary and appropriate, making it an ideal modernization to the character. Instead of wasting Batman's character credibility like Schumacher's biggest mistake, Nolan brings back the dignity and human spirit of the character. Supporting characters like Alfred (Michael Caine), tough city detective Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes) and others are great real people that surround the Batman's 'real' life. The script provides many great and memorable lines and Nolan keeps the characters and story involving while also providing good doses of action all the way.I'd call BATMAN BEGINS a great prequel/sequel, but it's more of a great restart. It makes a wonderful return to form. Like Alfred said: 'Master Wayne, you've been gone a long time. Welcome back!' Yes, welcome back, and, to Warner Bros., forget about the mistake of green-lighting BATMAN & ROBIN, all is forgiven.Rating: ****1/2 out of 5.",9,2,2,12 May 2008
Twilight," OK. Just OK.
","My Take: Not as great as the hype made it look, but still the movie fans would be delighted with. After a few popularity rates later, the hype got to me. Okay, not really. But while I didn't get the chance to read the immensely popular and addictive bestseller by Stephanie Meyer, I did get the chance to see the long-awaited adaptation. Advance news announced that the movie would have a limited budget since it isn't produced by a big, major studio, but the fans don't seem to take a hint. Besides, how much can a vampire movie cost? Well indeed, the low-budget quality of this TWILIGHT adaptation is obvious, the film still came out fine. As a breezy, cozy chick flick, TWILIGHT delivers. It'll make several teenage girls say 'aww..' every time while giving their dates a chance to make their move. I should have seen this with a date (of which I planned to)! I guess that pretty much what the movie was meant to be. It's sweet, cozy date movie (where the 'date' part is the guaranteed success).Kristen Stewart is a finely credible Bella, an attractive teenage girl who moves to the gloomy town of Forks with her father (Billy Burke) while her a mother remarries. Warmly accepted by her new classmates at at her new school, she is also fascinated by the mysteriously attractive Edawrd Cullen (Robert Pattinson), who, with no surprise to any fan or reader, is actually a vampire. Against all odds, the two unlikely couple fall in love and all the mellow moments flow. Also at hand are the consequences of their unlikely affair as a blood-hungry vampires pursue Bella, seeing her a nothing but a snack.TWILIGHT loses its inspiration in a few scenes, namely the 'effects-laden' moments as in the baseball scenes and scenes where the vampires jump on top of each other, but it doesn't so in its endearing old-fashioned romance. As an intimate love story, TWILIGHT does just about it. Try not to hug your date even when the movies over! Rating: *** out of 5.",6,2,6,9 December 2008
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," This is where the American GODZILLA is put to shame.
","My Take: A riveting, thrill-a-minute adventure sequel from the one and only Steven Spielberg. This has been a childhood favorite of mine, second only to the original, and this will be a great film to me. It comes to a little surprise to me, many hated it. Sure it's not pressed firmly or so to the sequel novel by Michael Chrichton, who also wrote the first, or maybe because of the last half hour of the film (Steven Spielberg's tribute to either 'Godzilla' or 'King Kong' perhaps). But surely, is it really that bad? Not really, once you come to think of it as pure adventure movie. Avoid all pretenses of reality, and get aught up in its thrills and non-stop adventure. THE LOST WORLD may not be high on realism, put in pure thrills, it's pure Dino-mite. It's still pretty obvious why many people hated this movie. Obviously, it's a sequel for sequel's sake. You know this movie should be made, and eventually it will, and it's bound to be bigger and better. And bigger it was indeed, with such a feeling of deja vu to some. Indeed, the movie has its similarities to the first movie. But still, despite its clichés, it's nice to have the same feeling of thrills and adventure the second time around. This movie does produce some thrills, excitement and suspense, so why can't it be enjoyed simply for that? The film not only reminded me about the first JURASSIC PARK, but such other similar movies like ALIENS and maybe a dash of KING KONG as well. THE LOST WORLD won't find a place next to SCHINDLER'S LIST or SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, but maybe it will manage to slip a seat right next to RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK and the other INDIANA JONES movies, as well as the first JURASSIC PARK, clearly demonstrating this still exhibits one of the director's impressive talents in building thrills: Keeping our palms sweaty as we slowly keep ourselves falling from the edge of our seats. THE LOST WORLD, with undeniably killer suspense, is Spielberg at his cat-and-mouse thriller best since... well the first JURASSIC PARK. Rating: **** out of 5.",8,1,4,24 May 2007
2012," Now, about the 10 stars...
","My Take: A big-budget guilty pleasure blockbuster with spectacular special effects. You get what you pay for.You can keep your TRANSFORMERS 2, and I don't even need to see G.I. JOE and even TERMINATOR:SALVATION anymore. Roland Emmerich's latest end-of-the-world blockbuster 2012 is my favorite guilty pleasure blockbuster of year, perhaps even for a long time. It's been a long time ever since I saw an end-of-days disaster movie. And come opening day, I invited a date, lined up to get tickets, bought a two tubs of popcorn and my date and I were lucky enough to get two front row seats. Anyone going out to see a disaster movie by Roland Emmerich will know what to expect: A wholesale planet-wide demolition derby filled with several stock characters and some clichéd situations washed down a potpourri of impressive special effects, top thrills and an all-star cast. So why, you ask, do I think the movie deserves a 10 stars? Simple: It was fun. Great fun indeed. And at several occasions, pretty funny too. 2012 isn't just a disaster movie, it's every disaster movie ever made before rolled into one, and maybe multiplied to 10. Not only does the film tips its hat to every major disaster movie of yesteryear's, from THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE, to EARTHQUAKE and WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE; It also references every disaster movie cliché in the book.The plot is pure sci-fi hokum about solar flares slowly heating up the Earth's core, not too fortunately coinciding with the Mayan civilization's prophecy of the Apocalypse. Scientist Adrian Helmsley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) warns the White House chief-of-staff (Oliver Platt) and even The President (Danny Glover) himself about the impending doom. But what every end-of-the-world disaster flick needs is that everyman character. That character is Jackson Curtis (John Cusack), a failed writer-turned-limo driver who must try to save his ex-wife (Amanda Peet) and her new surgeon boyfriend (Tom McCarthy); as well as his their two kids (Liam James and Morgan Lily) from a crumbling California and possibly take them to China, where supposedly the government is building ships to carry enough people in case of the upcoming deluge. Keeping up with his tradition of a 'small-end-of-the-world-after-all', the characters' fates are intertwined. Coincidence? I think not. Wait, don't throw your stones at me just yet. 2012 does have its ridiculous moments, plenty of them in fact. The clichés are fairly obvious (Don't worry, dogs never have their bad days in any Emmerich movie). There's isn't a cliché in the genre that Emmerich and co-writer Harald Kloser didn't embrace. You'll probably laugh at these clichés, and yet you don't really laugh at them, but with them. But perhaps what really makes the show are the special effects. Emmerich reportedly informs that this would be his last doomsday epic, and he definitely goes all the way here; the effects are par excellence here. Cities are ravaged by multiple earthquakes and tsunamis, active volcanoes appear and shoot great balls of fire, and in typical Emmerich tradition: national monuments are blown up real good (most of them, you might have glimpsed at the trailer). The story may be pure pseudo-science, but the effects seem to make the catastrophe almost too real. In one instance, when St. Peter's Basilica gets a shaky tremor, I had to lean over my date and jokingly tell her that it was alright and it wasn't real. 2012 is spectacular fun, and 'fun' is the key word here. The effects are truly marvelous, and unlike some of the other 'great' CGI these days, I actually had the time to absorb and marvel at how awesome they are. And for a movie that's built entirely of spectacle, the actors are surprisingly capable and sometimes believable. It may not be what the critics call a great movie, but for sheer escapism, the movie gives the audience what they pay for and will no doubt rake a lot of money in the box office. By the time the credits roll, my date and I had a good time and that's all that matters. And that's my 10 stars there. Take it or leave it, I loved this movie.Rating: ***** out of 5.",10,12,29,16 November 2009
X-Men: The Last Stand," The series 'X'-cels again.
","My Take: It's just as imperfect as the first two was, but when it's fun, it doesn't disappoint. One of the first big must-see summer blockbusters of 2006, X-MEN: THE LAST STAND is everything what you'd come to expect from a loud an reasonably entertaining finale of a long-running, big-budget franchise. This may not be the best in the series, it's certainly the most action-packed, even if it isn't exactly as kind to its writing department like the second film. THE LAST STAND, nonetheless, is an improvement over the original (and I kinda like that film), not just in terms of special effects, but also its pacing and writing, but basically more on pacing as the second was more on the writing. For fans, THE LAST STAND sorts out every single cliffhanger, plot strand and question thrown at you in the previous films, some of which you rarely thought of. To everyone else, like myself, who simply walks into a film like the X-MEN franchise expecting a pure summer popcorn bonanza, will have a grand time in pure 'check-your-brains-at-the-door' entertainment.The plot in this finale concerns the discovery of a 'cure' for mutants who kill off their mutant cells, therefore making them as human as the next guy. The X-Men, led by Professor X (Patrick Stewart), feel that mutation is not a disease in which it can be cured by a simple antidote, but their approach of the situation is more on curiosity and concern. While the ever-rebellious Magneto (Ian McKellen) feels that the Human race has gone too far, and decides to build his own mutant army, recruiting every mutant in America, to rebel against the 'cure' project. While this war ensues, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) is reunited with Jean Grey, know a mind-controlling juggernaut who destroys everything in her path.Every single thing you could possibly think of to finish the series are resolved here, and even if it is beyond your concern, X-MEN: THE LAST STAND will still delight its audience with pure action-packed popcorn-chomping excitement. The film makes you care less of plot and screenplay and lets you drown more on action the best that visual effects have to offer. With that and all, X-MEN: THE LAST STAND makes a great start for yet another busy year of popular action blockbusters.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",7,1,1,18 July 2008
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," A breathtaking 3-hour long climax of a terrific motion picture.
","My Take: Even better than the first. Bigger and definitely better. No matter how excellent, breathtaking or expensive the original adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING was, it would seem like a dress rehearsal compared to its follow-up, THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE TWO TOWERS. Recalling the second of the original STAR WARS trilogy THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, THE TWO TOWERS is but a bridge connecting the original to the finale of Tolkien's 'Rings' trilogy, THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE RETURN OF THE KING which was released the following year. Although not everything is concluded here in TWO TOWERS, it does have its beginning and end (and the flavorful inside at the middle). Think of it as one breathtaking climax of an entire movie, and have yourself a great time.This follow-up continues, but not necessarily concludes, the events portrayed in the first film. Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) continue their quest to destroy the One Ring in the fires of Mordor, while two Hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) find allies with the Ents (tree-like giants) in the dark forests. While looking for Merry and Pippin, much of the real story unfolds with Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) join forces with the Rohan people to fight against an out-numbering army created by the evil Saruman (Christopher Lee) bent to destroy Middle-Earth. The unforgettable battle climax (of a climax) is breathtakingly wonderful, made even more impressive by the fact that it's been made with combinations of miniatures, digital rendering, real people and other technology possibly available.But like the first film, this isn't all just technical advancements and special effects. THE TWO TOWERS doesn't water down Tolkien's story into a big-budget blunder. The film also isn't just made for a limited audience. Whether you know what's what or not about Tolkien's trilogy, this movie will still be enjoyable and entertaining. Once again, director Peter Jackson has made a movie for the audiences, not simply for a limited audience. The big-budget shows throughout the film, but it also shows that it's a great film with its storyline, characters and screen-writing. Few of today's Hollywood minds usually forget it, but Jackson couldn't afford to commit those sidesteps.Rating: ***** out of 5.",10,0,2,26 May 2008
Across the Universe," Hit soundtracks shine, story underwhelms in ACROSS THE UNIVERSE.
","My take: A visionary but utterly uneven musical. Watch it for the songs! Before I even express my single regret for the Beatlemania-worship ACROSS THE UNIVERSE, there'll be a band of loyal fanatics out there who'll still defend this film from critics or simply critical viewers like me. 'Oh, it's The Beatles. Screw You for not liking it for that!' They might say. But the powerhouse soundtrack is not the bad here. I wasn't even born during the supreme Beatlemania era but I know The Beatles music were and still is classic to this day. If you're a Beatles fan, there's no reason you shouldn't see this film, but I hardly doubt you'd want to see it for the story or its moralistic 'messages'. If I'd recommend ACROSS THE UNIVERSE to you, go see it for the music... and the music alone.This imaginative but scattered musical drama centers on mid-Vietnam war era, where hippies and partying teens hit streets. The movie is about a story told amidst the band's famous hits, which leads to romantic moments, emotional moments of tragedy, friendship and many other surreal adaptations drawn from the imaginative minds behind the screenplay (and basically, the whole film itself). For the record, the imagination here is immense and elaborate in every sense. Come on! Any film to associate Vietnam war, the Hippie era with a pleasant array of The Beatles' soundtracks fits the category of imaginative and outlandish. And besides, simply the music of those famous songs are bound to lure any of you to the big-screen or the video store, making sure you won't miss a thing.Everything about the soundtrack and the imaginative ideas are strong, but when it comes to finally telling a story, ACROSS THE UNIVERSE seems confusing and mostly dull. It concerns a love affair between a rebellious teen named Jude (Jim Sturgess), inspired from 'Hey Jude', and Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood), inspired from 'Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds', amidst a scandalous and chaos-ridden era of the Vietnam war. The story is convoluted and weakly-told. It's slow-moving and basically plodding, pretty weak when it comes to narrative. it all seems to be dependent on the Beatles music alone to carry the story, while it drags along. Director Julie Taymor has a thing for emotions, but she rarely swoops us here. Other than a blast from the past featuring Beatles favorites, the film rarely has a memorable moment once it devotes itself to dialog and screenplay.ACROSS THE UNIVERSE is not a bad film, it's just a major disappointment. Any fan of The Beatles would come and see this one, come what may. While they'll get their just rewards, they'll still be forced plod along a tedious storyline. Scattered character bits and weak story-telling make up for one imaginative and colorful mess. See it for the music, but you still have the option to buy the soundtrack instead.Rating: **1/2 out of 5.",5,1,2,15 August 2008
The Incredibles," They don't call 'em the Supers for nothing!
","My Take: It's a fun and funny animated comic-book entertainment with enough eye candy to give you a toothache.The days of FLASH GORDON is back with Pixar's THE INCREDIBLES, a fast-paced and highly entertaining take on the comic-book superhero fad. While big studios are making larger projects as SPIDER-MAN and a new entry in the BATMAN franchise, Pixar as made a worthy contender to any of these hits. It's packed with adventure, all-out action, intrigue and comedy, melded together with the best in computer animation has to offer. It's wild fun for kids and parents alike.After years of service, superheros Mr. Incredible (voiced by Craig T. Nelson) and Elastigirl (voiced by Holly Hunter) are kept under supervision under the Superhero Relocation Program. Forced to live mundane lives as a working father, Bob Parr, aka Mr. Incredible, longs for action, and gets his chance when a mysterious message gets in his hands, only to discover that what he really needs right now is a little family cooperation when an evil new villain named Syndrome (voiced by Jason Lee), who was formerly a superhero fanatic, now a crazed baddie who wants to get his share of the superhero limelight.The rest is a ride. The animation is crisp and active, with sequences that rival anything audiences have seen on any SPIDERMAN's or SUPERMAN's out there. The voice cast is familiar but never distracting (Samuel L. Jackson's voice performance as the super-cool hero Frozone is a favorite), lending their voices to some funny and colorful characters. Director Brad Bird may have had a kid's movie in mind while making this, but he packs in enough humor and adult appeal to make it perfect entertainment for the whole bunch. It ain't the best Pixar film however, but that doesn't matter. It's entertainment nonetheless.Rating: ****1/2 out of 5.",9,0,0,24 March 2009
The Mist," Not some ordinary monster movie.
","My Take: It's King done right. A first-rate and riveting adaptation.If you describe THE MIST in your own words, it would be nothing more than a big-budget B-movie. The setup is there: Strange creature began to come out of a mysterious mist, caused by a military cover-up gone awry, that covers up an entire town, sending a few lucky townsfolk to take refuge in a small grocery store. And yet, there lies he question: Who are the real monsters? The creatures outside, who grab and kill anyone who dare come outside, or the people inside who have their own different agendas and beliefs, and are growing sick of each other? THE MIST is unlike any monster movie I've seen in years. In fact, it's actually pretty frightening.If taken in its own B-movie merits, THE MIST works pretty well. There are ample amounts of scare and gore, and the special effects have their way of jumping out of the dark and scare you. But director Frank Darabont, who has since made a career out of making superb adaptations of Stephen King novels, wanted more out of the thing and comes up with arguably the best in its genre in years. The thrills are effective, but they are more psychological than visual, as the effectiveness of the frightening moments don't really rely on the special effects, but one the effectiveness of its performers. Thomas Jane (his second time out in a King adaptation) plays David Drayton, the hero-of-sorts of the movie, who leads the sane (or more accurately, stable) side of the trapped townsfolk who must find a way to save their skins, whilst the rest of the group as domineered by the fanatical Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden), who believes God has made her His vessel.Darabont and his effects crew use some relatively low-tech effects than the typical horror/monster fare, which means the CGI monsters here are not as effectively real as in other mainstream efforts. But this proves that the technology doesn't always have to be up-to-date as long as you utilize them well on screen. Besides, there are other elements of the story worth talking about than the effects. While other movies of this sort tell about how humanity will struggle as one in the face of danger, THE MIST does the opposite. It theorizes that, if disaster strikes, the rules are thrown out the window and the law of the jungle applies (According to one character, humanity as a species is fundamentally insane). Even the ending, which will downright turn off a few number of audiences expecting the typical Hollywood fare. The dark, twisted ending doesn't really symbolize anything per se, it's there to close what already was a dark and twisted movie; it intends to stay long in you long after the screen goes black.Not everyone will like the ending, or perhaps even the entire movie for its often negative view of humanity in peril (yet on that side, it portrays it with frightening speculation). Even the negative view of religion in times of peril (which, shown here, is not too different from pagan sacrifice) will shock believers to the core. But rest assured, everyone will be talking about THE MIST afterward.Rating: ***** out of 5.",10,2,5,10 January 2010
Ghostbusters," Classic 80's comedy.
","My Take: Hilarious comedy carried by a hilarious ensemble cast, gimmicky effects, and big laughs. A classic for bringing both special effects and comedy together successfully, GHOSTBUSTERS actually still holds up today. It's still a funny and elaborate fantasy with some fun special effects (which may not be as good in today's standards, but still enjoyable) and some very humorous performances by Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis as the three leads. It's not as great as it might have been, but what do I know, this one is still very good.Director Ivan Reitman keeps things as lively as possible. The early special effects work on creatures and spirits (including the infamous Marshmallow Man) are fun to look at. They're not as good as today's, and these may be even considered low-tech, but they have something some of today's special effects have, and that's imagination. It took some imagination to create strange wonders as these, and they're worth looking at.Other than special effects, the real appeal of GHOSTBUSTERS comes from the actors and the rest of the crew. Lead actors, as well as supporting characters like the ones played by Sigourney Weaver, Annie Potts, Rick Moranis and Ernie Hudson, are very well played. The script is finely rewarding with funny one-liners to great jokes. It's also flavored with parodies (THE EXORCIST mainly) and some in-jokes. GHOSTBUSTERS proves that, even with the distractions of special effects, a comedy can still be funny at the same time.Rating: ****1/2 out of 5.",9,0,0,17 May 2008
Shrek the Third," Watchable, but I couldn't help being disappointed.
","My Take: The weakest of the successful SHREK series. A few laughs though.After seeing art in the first two 'Shrek' films, we would have expected more from 'Shrek the Third'. Although most of the laughs work, the creators make a mistake thinking it'll save the story. The story, basically, is almost nonexistent. It runs in a short 92 minutes, much too short, with not much happening with as much joy as those in previous SHREK films, partly due to the emptiness of its story. Still, there are enough well-executed comedy bits and I must say our Ogre still has the charm. The story has Shrek (voiced by Mike Myers) destined to take over the kingdom of Far, Far Away, after the king (voiced briefly by John Cleese) passed away. Shrek, who thinks he's unworthy to take the king's position, instead searches for Arthur, who happens to be Princess Fiona's (voiced by Cameron Diaz) cousin. He finds Arthur (voiced by Justin Timberlake) in a Medieval College, being a total wimp. This is not the picture of a ruler, right? But no time for that, Prince Charming (voiced by Rupert Everett) demands a Royal treatment (a term here which I mean 'he wants to be king'). So of course, we get Shrek and his gang to the rescue and all that jazz. This leads to a couple of fun bits (including princesses that would put Lara Croft aside), but none quite as joyfully executed as those in its predecessors.As far as sequels go, disappointments are bound to come. I enjoyed the first 'Shrek' film, it can easily pass as a modern instant classic, and the second one, 'Shrek 2', is indeed a modern classic and their's no doubt about it, but 'Shrek the Third' just makes you laugh, good enough, but I think we need more than 'good enough'. Instead of a lot of writers who know how to make people laugh, the directors (two of them, actually) could have at least hired ones that write a good story. The characters in this film are not given enough depth or interest, not unlike those in the those in previous SHREK films, so filled with zest and energy, as well as soft bits and adult-related personalities. The conclusion, which might be the weakest link of the film, is easily rushed. Still, If you liked the first two films then there is no stopping you from watching this one. Shrek and the gang, although unoriginal, still provide a bunch of smiles, and I did laugh a lot in this picture. Watch out for that ROSEMARY'S BABY-inspired nightmare! I'm ending this fairy tale of a film review by saying that I did like this entry. It was funny but lacks the creativity of the first two. With so much characters in this film, I would have expected them to have more life than a bunch of comedy bar-inspired figures molded to fairytale characters. SHREK THE THIRD is a much better view on video. It's worth buying and, with expectations that it would fall short of its predecessors, it does offer a few good laughs.

Back to the Future Part III," East meets The West.
","My Take: Not the strongest in the hit series, but strong enough to keep the series moving.When it finally reached Part III, the BACK TO THE FUTURE series has certainly showed its age. The film's lack of the ingenious ideas that the first films had isolates this from the first two. The film is more of a Western comedy for most part of the film, but not a bad one. Still at the hands of the highly creative crew of Robert Zemeckis (director,co-writer), Bob Gale (writer) and Steven Spielberg (executive producer), BACK TO THE FUTURE III (which was shot back-to-back with Part II) doesn't succumbs to sequel dreadfulness, something that other sequels usually fall upon.The film is not as special effects laden as the second, nor as the first. Although it would probably have been for the best, it lacks the pure high-concept fun. The film rests itself as a Western comedy for most of the time, including a quirky love story between the series' best character Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) and fluent schoolteacher Clara Clayton (Mary Steenburgen). McFly also challenges the toughest gunman in the West named the 'Mad Dog' Tennen (Thomas F. Wilson), presumably Biff Tennen's ancestor. For most parts, its a less effects-driven comedy, with more emphasis on comedy.The path taken by this sequel makes it less crowded and confusing as the second in the series, but it also lacks the manic charms. The original was more lively for most of the time, and it had more ideas while the second film moved at a fast pace with fun at every corner. This film settles to heavily on a Western comedy mode, which makes it rather lacking.But the overall effect is still a good movie. Not as good as I hoped, and this one is the least that holds up among the three films, but I liked it and why wouldn't I. The script, although not filled with the clever time-travel hokum that I loved in the first two, is still cleverly filled with deft comedy bits and appealing characters. It's often tired and repetitive, but there's still so much to recommend.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",7,0,0,12 May 2008
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Better but still not 'Fantastic'.
","My take: Although better than the first, it's absolutely nothing to be wild about. I wasn't exactly anticipated when I heard that they were releasing a sequel to 2005's FANTASTIC FOUR, for I didn't actually like that film. But still, I went out to see it on a premiere night during the last few days of the summer. Like I expected, the film is filled with special effects. Surprisingly though, it was better than the first film. Unlike the first, this sequel actually has a real villain, much more compelling than the banal Dr. Doom, who is still here and still played by Julian McMahon (but thankfully, not as major as in the original). The villain is actually a quite interesting character since it is actually given a back-story unlike the other characters. The comedy is is improved as well, and some are actually funny.FANTASTIC FOUR: RISE OF THE SILVER SURFER is better than the first film, but it's still not a very good film on its own. The film is still mediocre when it came to writing a story and a bunch of interesting characters. The characters here are just the same forgettable pieces of cardboard cutouts in the first film. Besides fighting the arrival of the Silver Surfer (voiced by Laurence Fishburne) who has manipulated weather and produced mayhem at the process, Reed Richards aka Mr. Fantastic (Ioan Gruffud) and Sue Storm aka The Invisible Woman (Jessica Alba) are getting married, and their the target of many controversies. I don't give a damn! That pathetic subplot could have been removed and still create a movie, but only less as pathetic as it is right now.As a special effects creation, The Silver Surfer is OK. As a matter of fact, had they centered the movie on the story of this character, I think it might have been better (might!). Instead, it centers on a bunch of uninteresting cardboard cutouts, not to mention the return of Chris Evans' overly annoying playboy Human Torch character. FANTASTIC FOUR: RISE OF THE SILVER SURFER is not a totally awful film, but I still can't recommend it higher than a worthy rental.Rating: ** out of 5.",4,0,1,15 May 2008
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," A life well spent.
","My Take: A sweeping, touching and honestly tear-jerking fable. A future classic?The great Mark Twain once remarked that 'the best part of life was from the beginning and the worst part was the end'. This was soon the inspiration of writer F. Scott Fitzgerald for his short story THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON (which was then retooled by screenwriter Eric Roth for this brilliant screen adaptation), which took Twain's remark as an inspiration, then it contrasts it. Instead of living life from young to old, Fitzgerald questioned what would life be when lived by a man who aged backwards, having it the other way around. What would life be if, while this man was born as an old man then aged backwards into a younger being, all his loved ones aged until their untimely death arrives? And most of all, how would he feel when he slowly witnesses his loved ones grow old and die in front of his very eyes as he slowly ages in reverse? This is the strange alternate reality (the 'curious case', if you may) of Benjamin Button (Brad Pitt), who was strangely born as an old man, abandoned by his grief-stricken father (Jason Flemyng) and adopted by a nurse in an retirement home (Taraji P. Henson), where he slowly ages from a strangely deformed old man that resembles a gnome to a young, handsome man, then younger. But the in-between moments is what really matters in this 'curious case', where our odd companion Benjamin discovers love in the eyes of the charming Daisy (Cate Blanchett), experiences pain in plight of the tragic death of his loved ones and basically, life itself as joyous and unpredictable, and spending every moment of it while it lasts.It's hard not to feel a wee bit misty-eyed in such emotionally-powerful moments in the movies, especially if they are as sincere and honestly true-to-the-point as the ones in THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON, a life-affirming tale which is the best of its kind since Roth's own FORREST GUMP. First, I look at 'THE CURIOUS CASE' as a technical accomplishment that it is. But 'CURIOUS CASE' proves to be an even deeper experience as a movie. Long after I saw it, I wasn't simply remembering how beautifully detailed and eye-filling it was, I was recalling its message about life and love and how to live them. The excellent screenplay by Mr. Roth is that kind of material that stays with you long after the experience is over, and every bit of it is still dazzling long after the visual experience has gone. Testimonials such as 'Your life is defined by its opportunities... even the ones you miss.' or 'We're meant to lose the people we love. How else would we know how important they are to us?' are such lines I won't soon forget long after seeing a movie. THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON is a curious case indeed, a movie unlike any movie I have ever seen before, at least in this season so far or for a very long time.It's imperfect to be sure. It's a cover-to-cover telling and Roth doesn't afford to leave any remaining details behind, making this the 166 minute long experience that it is. The mid-section is especially long, as well as a few moments earlier that prolong this already long affair even more. But 'CURIOUS CASE' is that kind of movie that has to be loved, a strong an unique story, that must be judged by the sum of its parts. And to put it lightly, the thing that need to be perfect, are. The performances from the stellar talents meet the intelligence and grace of the characters they portray (especially watchable is Pitt in his age-changing performance as Benjamin and Taraji Henson in her breakthrough role as Benjamin's foster mother Queenie). David Fincher has led a successful career as a director in years, and with 'CURIOUS CASE', he never lets his successful career astray. He might not have done anything with the slightly overlong run time or the sometimes sedate pace, but he does bring the movie to life on screen, which is all that this tale needs. The special effects and fine make-up job are put to such good purpose that they blend seamlessly into the background. The movie feels and looks like the technical accomplishment that it is and never for once feel like another dazzling special effects movie. Now that's special effects for a very special movie. THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON may be flawed, but it has earned its place in Hollywood history, or if not, it will leave a mark in future major Hollywood efforts that it's not enough that you have a great story to work with (that's a surefire to attract the folks at the Oscars), but that's it's just as important to have a great storyteller who knows how to put it all together on screen. And with THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON, Fincher proves he is.Rating: ***** out of 5.",10,1,4,2 April 2009
Transformers," More than meets the eye.
","My Take: Subtlety is not in the name of Michael Bay, but boring isn't either. 'Pump up the volume! I like that special effect, but make it look more real! Now, I like that shot, well done!' That's what probably Michael Bay said repetitively, other than 'Action!' and 'Cut!', all throughout his latest summer blockbuster TRANSFORMERS, and when it is what you've come to hope for (big, glossy, silly and noisy), then TRANSFORMERS is the best, most anticipated and enjoyable rides of the summer. Does it live up to the hype? Never thought so before. When I saw the trailers and posters set up for advertising the film, I though this would just be another summer popcorn movie that's doing its job. I also though it would just be another exhibition of the newest line of special effects available at the department, something that director Michael 'Kaboom' Bay is more comfortable to make.I stand corrected. While it is silly, dumb and has no ambition to write, TRANSFORMERS works on the levels where it should work. The action keeps viewers on the go, and under the watchful eye of exec. producer Steven Spielberg and his Dreamworks crew, TRANSFORMERS has touches of class (a class of its own that is). Shia LaBeouf plays Sam Witwicky, a teenager who gets himself involved into a plot to save the world when his 'new' car turns out to be one of the Autobots, a race of machines set to save the earth from their enemies, the Decepticons. They're also in search of an object called the Allspark, also known as 'The Cube' before the Decepticons rest their dirty hands on them, therefore fulfilling their plans for intergalactic supremacy. Along the way, the film juices up a few subplots including Sam flirting with the hottest chick in his school, played by model/actress Megan Fox. There's also subplots concerning a bunch of American soldiers (mainly Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson) and their families, but it's rarely exercised and almost utterly forgotten.TRANSFORMERS may not have much of a plot, and if it does, it feels like it's been written by a bunch of kids playing with their Transformers toys. But what's weak in plot is more than made up for pure summer movie entertainment. Bay booms up the sound system, making it quite possibly the loudest summer movie since Bay's own films like THE ROCK and BAD BOYS. The special effects are triumphant creations, making the famous gang of Optimus Prime, Megatron, Bumblebee and the lot far beyond their plastic toy origins. Every single rust and scratch is captured by the film's creative and industrious effects crew. The fights scenes, most especially during the early moments of the film are especially exciting. The problem that lies on its never-lacking amount of action is that in almost overstays its welcome. The film runs at about 144 minutes tops (that's more than 2 hours!), much too long for a movie that doesn't intend to make much sense. The film could have cut at least 30 minutes or so of special effects and have nothing to risk losing.Still, while surely not free of its flaws, TRANSFORMERS is everything you can ask for in a summer action entertainment. It may not offer anything more in bargain, but it deserves much credit for offering one of the better times I've experienced at the movies during the year.Rating: **** out of 5.",8,2,3,15 July 2008
Men in Black II," More of the same, but just as fun.
","My Take: Not as wildly enjoyable as the first, but makes a terrific sequel. Summer movie sequels are usually the victims of the 'sequelness'. Most sequels to big blockbuster hits tend to simply repeat the success of the first film, and simply recycle the formula of its predecessor. MEN IN BLACK II (or simply MIIB) is no exception. It practically repeats the formula of the first film: Aliens are out again, J (Will Smith) and K (Tommy Lee Jones) are back as partners to fight against it and the whole lot. The formula is copied, but the same cannot be said about the rest of the film. There are new rabbits in this same bag of tricks. Although most innovations are of special effects, MIIB provides some new fun moments in a somewhat formula approach.Like said, MIIB returns Smith and Jones as the dynamic duo out to stop an alien, a creature called the Kylothian, who takes the form of a lingerie model (Lara Flynn Boyle), who, guess what? Trying to take over the world. of course. This is nothing new in comparison. It's mostly just a retread of the previous film. But few of these 'been there, done that' sequels are fun in a different way. This one is, and it's actually surprisingly entertaining. The new script by Robert Gordon and Barry Fanaro contains a number of effective puns which elevates the humor from other formula sequels.Of course, there are new and colorful special effects from mostly the same crew of the original film. The effects by effects house Industrial Light & Magic and make-up artist Rick Baker are still outlandish and imaginative. They still give us a host of aliens and creatures that we can feast our eyes upon. Not much imagination went to the storyline and characters, but a lot was certainly invested upon the effects and visuals. Kudos for director Barry Sonnenfeld, production designer Bo Welch and much of the special effects crew for providing a colorful atmosphere that bursts with liveliness in an otherwise formulaic episode of summer sequel season. It's the same old thing, but with new fun.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",7,23,33,26 May 2008
Clash of the Titans," Lower your expectations... and see it on 2-D instead.
","With the right expectations, CLASH OF THE TITANS is a pretty enjoyable update of the 1981 minor fantasy classic if you can forgive some of the absurdities of the script. I loved the original CLASH OF THE TITANS but I don't see anything wrong about remaking it, and when I saw the trailers I knew what to expect: A bone-headed, old school adventure movie with lots of action despite only having half a plot. I went in with little expectations and got out just fine, and provided that you don't expect anything else, you will too. And oh yeah, take everyone's advice and see it on 2-D. I took the advice to not see it on 3-D and seeing that the movie is not as bad as everyone has said it was, I think you should to.Turns out director Louis Leterrier and writers Travis Beacham, Phil May, and Matt Manfredi have done more than update Ray Harryhausen's vintage claymation monsters. Other than amping up the action, they have also added and changed several elements in the script. But despite a few decent additions, none of them really add much. The whole plot about mortals doing war with the gods might have been intriguing, but it's all played rather silly here. How do the brave warriors of Argos plan to fight the gods with only swords and spears? These, along with a few other inconsistencies just make the story a little confusing. And typical to any modern action/adventure movie, our hero Perseus (played by Sam Worthington) has to have a tragic background so he can hate the gods throughout the whole movie and get the job done the dirtiest way possibly. Does every action hero today have no other motive than a vendetta? Despite their best efforts, none of the performances really connected with me (Gemma Atherton's Io came close, but whatever she had with Perseus wasn't deeply ventured and therefore utterly forgettable). However, I enjoyed big-time actors like Liam Neeson (who performs his now-famous 3-word line immortally) and Ralph Fiennes (who does another sneering Lord Voldemort impression) who had a ball as some of the immortals.But other than these several alternations, the movie is fairly faithful to the original, only 10 times bigger. You thought a fight with giant scorpions was cool? How about one with giant scorpions 10 times bigger? You think the Kraken is huge? This one makes the one in PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN 2 look camera-shy. But this gives and takes from the experience. The action sequences are quite exciting, even without the use of distracting 3-D. But on the other hand, it's as if Leterrier wants every moment of the movie to be loud and amped-up. Even the encounter with the Stygian Witches (who looked like they came out from PAN'S LABYRINTH) isn't devoid of a shaky action sequence. Nevertheless, the many special effects are pretty good and some of the action sequences they're in are some of the film's highlights. The aforementioned scorpion duel has to stand as my favorite, but there's also the battle in Medusa's lair (surprisingly enjoyable, but lacking the suspense from the one in the original) and the final stand-off with the Kraken.It won't be another fantasy film favorite like the original, but if you don't expect nothing more than a popcorn-movie that does what it's supposed to do, CLASH OF THE TITANS ain't have bad. Perhaps just for Neeson's delivery of his immortal 'Release the Kraken!' in all its glory, this movie is worth seeing.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",7,0,1,20 April 2010
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Burton's trip to a candy-coated paradise is a wonderful excursion.
","My Take: Colorful visuals and elaborate storytelling. Tim Burton proved that his talents can go beyond what is expected from him in his previous effort BIG FISH, which incidentally also has something in kin with Roald Dahl, who wrote the story which this film is based upon. CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY is less a remake of the 1970 classic of the nearly-same name (simply change the title from 'Charlie' to 'Willy Wonka') as it is more an adaptation of the book itself, of which many hail as more faithful adaptation than the original classic. Though I have not read the Dahl book, I say this CHARLIE is a great adaptation simply since the imagination, the blissfulness, the sweetness and the overall goodness of it all are there.Burton is perfect for attaching the darker elements of Dahl's tale, but mostly he's in light mode. The movie is more cheery and dark, which is appropriate. There are some flaws rising when the film gets too sweet at a few moments, with Charlie (played by Freddie Highmore) getting a little preachy and too chewy for the sweet tooth. But, flawed as it might, CHARLIE is a lot of fun, and in yet another season of excessive potboilers, this one stands out as an imaginative and simply entertaining achievement. There's more than enough family entertainment value to provide treats for audiences here.The movie keeps deep faith to its source with practically the same story: Eccentric candy-maker Willy Wonka (another winning performance from Johnny Depp) randomly placed 5 golden tickets inside the wrappers of 5 lucky Wonka Bars. Any lucky kid who gets either of them will receive a much-pleasant reward: a trip through Wonka's never-before-seen candy factory, with a secret price at the end. Besides the lucky Charlie and his grandfather (David Kelly), there's also the competent and overly challenging Violet Beauregarde (Annasophia Robb), the spoiled rich girl Veruca Salt (Julia Winter), the candy-mongering glutton Augustus Gloop (Philip Wiegratz) and the TV-addicted Mike Teavee (Jordan Fry), accompanied by their parent/guardian.The world inside the factory is one blissful and exuberant creation. It bursts with life and color as we bedazzle at a chocolate-coated river, a candy-molded boat, workaholic squirrels in a nut-cracking room, an elevator that goes down/up/side/etc and the always present Oompa-Lumpas (as played by a duplicated Deep Roy). As the original story goes, the kids get into a lot of sticky situations, either due to their ignorance or over-confidence. But other than that, we also get to know the man behind the candy himself. Thanks to a couple of random but endearing flashbacks, we get to know Willy Wonka much more. There's also a lot of getting-to-know with Willy's creepy dentist father (as played by always creepy Christopher Lee). Then there's Charlie's family, a poverty-suffered member of society who manages to live life the way it should: a perfect depiction of a perfect family.Visuals delight as morals abound, CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY is perfect family entertainment. A harmless yet exhilarating adventure where everyone in the family, young and old, would cheer. This is, any every sense of the word, wonderful eye-candy.Rating: **** out of 5.",8,0,1,13 September 2008
Mission: Impossible II," 'Mission': Acceptable.
","My Take: Impressive action-with-style save the rather tepid script. Departing from Brian DePalma's thickly-plotted (but actually more satisfying) original, Hong Kong action god John Woo took over the mission DePalma chose to accept, and while the movie is less plot, more action with emphasis of Woo's trademark style, this sequel lacks the sort of class and brilliance of its predecessor. Although many regards DePalma's original as 'confusing' or 'trivial', I much prefer the original over this flashy, globe-trotting sequel. Still, there are some moments here and their, but sadly, most of them happen during the climax (which probably prompted me to give this film at least a ***). MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE II (aka MI:2) took the plot less seriously. But the problem this time is the plot is the one missing now. It has a plot that I hardly cared about, which leaves the film with a lot of dumb things going around. What we're left is an edgy, bloated action picture that has fun with its cool visuals and stunts without thinking about common sense. Just put 'dumb' right in the middle of 'action' and 'movie' and enjoy the action-packed material.Tom Cruise is back as CIA agent Ethan Hunt, sent on another mission to retrieve and destroy a genetically modified disease called the 'Chimera' before it falls into the hands of the bad guys. The bad guys are lead by Sean Ambrose, played by Dougray Scott. Thandie Newton provide the lead female (I wouldn't call her the damsel-in-distress for she has a lot to do to be one) and Vhing Rhames is back as one of Hunt's old buddies.The film's director is Hong Kong action director John Woo, who really knows how to make action movies, oriental or not. MI:2 may not be as triumphant as his other action bonanzas like FACE/OFF, but he still gives the action enough grit and cool to be notable. There are some neat car chases and loud motorcycle drives, but not only in the action sequences can Woo shoot good. There is one scene in the movie where Ethan Hunt walks through a dark corner and makes noise, scaring a couple of doves flying, in slow-motion. This wasn't an action sequence, but it's shot well to be just as terrific as one.For good summer fun, MI:2 is not a bad choice. Yes, it's dumb. Yes, the plot does nothing more than string together Woo's stylish stunt sequences together, but it looks good and it does feel good. If only it were any better.

A Bug's Life," It has terrific animation, colorful characters and pure storyline, what more could you ask for in a film?
","My take: What animated movies are all about. Seeing a different kind of world when venturing in the movies have always been a delight to me. A BUG'S LIFE, once again, takes me to that glowing escapade. Introducing me to a different world, meeting different ranges of characters and freshen up with a good story as it goes along. All those delightful pleasures are here in A BUG'S LIFE. It has terrific animation, colorful characters and pure storyline, what more could you ask for in a film.Pixar, ever since they made TOY STORY, has gone of in a winning streak. A BUG'S LIFE still keeps their victory running. Thanks, mainly, to director John Lasseter who keeps a Disney tradition when making these movies. In A BUG'S LIFE, The animation and quality is strictly Pixar, but the story, about the cooperation and determination against odds against them, are the stuff Disney films are famous for.The film was released alongside another ant film entitled ANTZ, which sounds like they have similar plot lines. But their plots aren't that identical. While ANTZ appeals more to a mature choice of audience due to its mature characters, despite the child movie plot. Ask for A BUG'S LIFE, which tells the story of a colony of ants, bullied by a swarm of grasshoppers, who has nothing to do but lay around, is a less complicated plot. Thus, A BUG'S LIFE is the movie to show the kids more often, while ANTZ will be the adults'.I'm not just rating A BUG'S LIFE high because it's a terrific animated film. But also because it takes us, once again, to a different world, one where we set are imaginations free, free from the bounds of reality.Rating: ***** out of 5.",10,0,0,28 September 2007
Big Fish," BIG FISH has a big heart.
","My Take: Wildly imaginative story-telling. And after a second look, a truly great movie. When we hear the name Tim Burton, we don't usually expect merriment or the cheerfulness, at least not without a dash of melancholy or the dark and depressing. This is perhaps one of the reasons why Burton remains one of the most imaginative and bold visionary filmmakers Hollywood still gives a job to. Other than two dark and brilliant BATMAN movies to his credit, he is also responsible for dark 'fairy tales' such as EDWARD SCISSORHANDS and SLEEPY HOLLOW, not to mention clever black comedies as BEETLEJUICE and MARS ATTACKS! But much like other artists, confine Burton to some unfamiliar terrain and you either get a good experiment or a terrible film. Burton proves he can't do sci-fi remakes in his disappointing remake of the classic PLANET OF THE APES. Now Burton breaks out on his old routine once more in BIG FISH, a comedy/drama about life with a little dash of fairy tale-esquire metaphors. Despite it's nod to fantasy (one of Burton's favorite genres) and a few talks of dark elements, BIG FISH is more about lightheartedness and sentimentality, certainly not the sort of things Burton works with. But some surprise! BIG FISH, while not pure Burton, is a terrific Tim Burton film nonetheless. It's elaborate, fanciful, imaginative and oftentimes uplifting. Above all, it's an ode to the power of storytelling. It's not in league with Burton's other films, simply parting him from his craft is sets it aside, but that may also be the reason why this film is simply stirring and curious entertainment. It's so unlike Burton that it's also unlike any film I've ever seen.The story's about an old man named Edward Bloom (Albert Finney), already at his deathbed, and to remember him by, he tells the story of his life in a series of stretchy metaphors, much to the delight of his wife (Jessica Lange) and much to the dissatisfaction of his son (Billy Crudup). He tells, as a young man (played by Ewan McGregor), that his life was filled with adventures tied with life, love, revelations, realizations and life-changing moments. But here's the stretch: he also confronts an ugly giant who just happens to be misplaced in a small town, he also works for a carnival barker (Danny DeVito) in a carnival unlike other, he encounters mermaids & other magical entities and when they say when you find the love of your life, time stops, it's true! Perhaps I one of the reasons I didn't love BIG FISH that much when I first saw it is that it was totally different from Burton's other efforts. After seeing it again, I accepted it's differences and was thoroughly satisfied by a fantastic and highly original work. It's treacly to be sure, something that Burton usually avoids in his other films (he usually lets us relate to his characters in pains, not comforts). But BIG FISH, with it's differences, is proof that Burton can go soft on us if he can. Rating: ***** out of 5.",10,0,0,4 September 2008
The Dark Knight," DARK KNIGHT makes no funny business for the Bat.
","My Take: A bold, visionary modern classic.No joke here! THE DARK KNIGHT, the new Batman thriller from Christopher Nolan, has a lot of buzz that comes along the merchandise and the marketing, but it avoids all the shortcomings, and even in fact going beyond audience expectations. After Nolan's own brooding and realistic version BATMAN BEGINS, audience expected a similar approach on DARK KNIGHT. The arrogant Bruce Wayne, the darker vigilante Batman, no nipples on the Batsuit, all that is fulfilled in this new film, but this is also darker and much better than anyone in the audience expected it to be. In fact, it's the darkest, deepest and most significant and exciting one in the series since BATMAN RETURNS. While it takes a different path from the original series (although thankfully, staying much away from the awful BATMAN & ROBIN), this is the new Batman for the new ages.Christian Bale reprises his role as the most arrogant (and best) Bruce Wayne, and alter ego Batman, who once again sets out to restore order in the crime-ridden streets of Gotham City (not exactly the land of opportunity), as it is once again leaking with criminality and injustice, in the form of the evil Joker (the late Heath Ledger, who makes a brilliant performance in his last film that made the evening news) and crime lords who terrorize and make their own circus of chaos. It's up to the Bat to put a stop to it all, but this time, it ain't juts gonna be his job. District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) is the hero without a mask who lends his own hands to keep Gotham in high stands against crime, despite the every growing urban chaos. Dent also happens to be dating Bruce Wayne's best friend Rachael Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal, replacing Mrs. Cruise Katie Holmes), blooming up a little love triangle that doesn't go corny at all.Nolan's Batman worlds are fantastic and effective ones. Whilst not the visually eye-popping Blade Runner-era Gotham City that Tim Burton's BATMAN RETURNS was, but surely much closer to the reality of current situations. This time, the threats are real, and the solutions to the problems are far more desperate than kicking ass. Crime is real, crime is bad, and Nolan emphasizes on every frame. The absolute reality of the picture is one of the reasons why it's the best and most topical Bat-film to date. But DARK KNIGHT is a mere subject discussion. The excitement comes in waves, from chases down the dark streets with trucks, vans, and the Bat's own Batmobile (which transforms into a speeding motor-bike when it self-destructs), or battle sequences that are intense as they are well-made, DARK KNIGHT satisfies as pure entertainment. The screenplay is bold and daring, venturing into a subject so much deeper than where it usually settles upon (enough to make you forget the fiasco BATMAN & ROBIN was). Then there are the performances, mentioning the late Mr. Ledger's performance front and center, are excellent and nearly flawless. To date, it may be the best performed superhero flick I've ever seen.All-in-all, THE DARK KNIGHT is the superhero mainstream of the summer you have got to see if you see no other (and I may doubt that you'll see more). No joke! Rating: ***** out of 5.",10,9,19,1 August 2008
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," New 'Order' is darker but still dazzling, enjoyable.
","My Take: Darker than its predecessors and rather ordinary and rushed in quality, but it's still a magical and imaginative adventure. 'Difficult times lie ahead, Harry', says the wise Professor Dumbledore at the end of HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE, and in his 5th year at Hogwarts, our young Mr. Potter is about to discover what he meant. HARRY POTTER AND THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX, the adaptation of J.K. Rowling's much-anticipated 5th novel in the successful bestselling series is a surprisingly shorter movie. For a movie that prepares a no-longer-too-young Harry (Daniel Radcliffe, also not too young anymore) to confront the inevitable Dark Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes), this movie is a must-see, but falls short of the mark. In his 5th year, Harry recollects with his friends, including the ever loyal Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson), to create a certain 'Dumbledore's Army' to fight against the evil Voldemort's forces, including a sinister maniac called Bellatrix Lestrange (Helena Bonham Carter), much to the disapproval of the domineering new Dark Arts teacher Proffesor Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton, who can make a dark lord cower any day). The film is fairly shorter than its predecessors, with so much to do with the new director David Yates, who cuts what might be the longest book in the series into the shortest in the film adaptations. Events move too fast that the movie feels like a rush job. Don't mind me, but I preferred Colombus' and original screenwriter Steve Kloves safe cover-to-cover faithfulness than the otherwise rushed narrative of Yates and new screenwriter Michael Goldenberg. I haven't read the ORDER OF THE PHOENIX novel, but I don't need to to figure out that there's something lost in translation. Even the new score by Yates veteran composer Nicolas Hooper was underwhelming; John Williams' whimsical score for the earlier films have been replaced by cues that any composer could make. But, shorter or darker than its predecessors, There's still enough magic left in ORDER OF THE PHOENIX to make it an enjoyable and highly imaginative adventure. With great characters (with the addition of the intriguing Luna Lovegood, played by newcomer Evanna Lynch), a few compelling plot twists (a revelation of Snape's depressing past is a revelation), imaginative special effects and maybe even a few startling creatures, I enjoyed HARRY POTTER AND THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX even if I was a little letdown by my memories of its highly superior predecessors.

Men in Black," A silly comedy for smart people.
","My Take: Hilarious special effects comedy with smart gags and a whole lot of slime. MEN IN BLACK (known simply as MIB) is yet another summer affair in an already busy affair for summer blockbusters. But like the best ones, MIB learns not to take itself too seriously. Whether it concerns that anyone on Earth is an alien, or a giant cockroach, MIB knows how to make fun with itself and happily admit that it's a comedy. And as a comedy, MIB is actually clever and ingenious. The screenplay by Ed Solomon is filled with clever gags as well as clever ideas. The film is like one clever comic book cartoon with some really smart and hilarious ideas. It is based on a famous comic by Lowell Cunnigham, so the film does the right justice to its source.Will Smith, who last appeared in another alien invasion flick INDEPENDENCE DAY, is back, and joining him is Tommy Lee Jones, and chemistry between these two characters are terrific. Like in tradition of other partners like Mel Gibson and Danny Glover in the LETHAL WEAPON series, Jones and Smith have different personalities, and the sparring between them are worth watching. Solomon's screenplay gives these two guys a lot to do. The rest of the cast have been given the same good treatment as well, which is so much to be said about other summer flicks. The story concerns MIB agents J (Smith) and K (Jones) trying to save the world from a bug-like creature, who takes the form of a Hill-billy farmer (Vincent D'Onofrio) as a sort of human disguise, to take over the world by obtaining a sort of 'Galaxy'.Then of course, there are the special effects, which are terrific. Created by the effect wizards from Industrial Light & Magic, the effects here are fun to look it, as they are plentiful. There's also a lot of help from Rick Baker, a professional with monster puppets and make-up, which brings to life a series of slimy yet creative critters as tiny alien 'worms' or a giant cockroach that takes the skin and life of a farmer. These effects are darn good. Other than special effects are the production design created by Bo Welch, which are elaborate and fancy. Director Barry Sonnenfeld and his associates have a field day with these crazy, colorful, imaginative and, yes, slimy galaxy of visuals and creates a very stylish summer flick, but not so without substance.Rating: ****1/2 out of 5.",9,1,2,26 May 2008
Alice in Wonderland," An 'Alice' for a new generation. Another Burton classic comes to life.
","My Take: In Burton's version of ALICE IN WONDERLAND, there is never the lack of imagination, wit, and a few dark touches of his previous works.It's a bumpy ride down the rabbit hole and through the Looking Glass, but with Tim Burton as our guide, I wouldn't mind how far he would take me. Instead of adding to the multitude of screen adaptations of the beloved Lewis Carroll stories, Burton takes his own spin on the classic story, a decision that will no doubt anger some purists. But I take this move as a good thing. Other than being pure eye-candy, what Burton adds in his 'Alice'- something the original stories actually lacked- is direction. Unlike the previous versions, Burton's ALICE IN WONDERLAND is not just a series of odd characters strung together by a series odd situations, it's a full-blown adventure story. And filmed in gorgeous 3-D, taking a look through the Looking Glass will not be the same again.Alice is not what you remember her to be. Wonderland (now Underland) is not what she remembers it to be either. Now 19 (and played by newcomer Mia Wasikowska), Alice is stubborn and headstrong, yet unable to fit in with the Victorian-age lifestyle of the society she grew up in. After rejecting the marriage proposal of her arrogant suitor (Leo Bill), she follows a familiar white rabbit down the rabbit hole and is thrown back into a world she has a vague recollection of, where she is welcomed as sort of a hero. See, Alice is destined to rid the land from the evil rule of the ill-tempered Red Queen (Helena Bonham-Carter, with a huge head) by slaying her pet Jabberwocky (voiced, briefly, by Christopher Lee). But the thing is, old acquaintances like the White Rabbit (voiced by Michael Sheen), The Chesire Cat (voiced by Stephen Fry), and Absolem the Caterpillar (voiced by Alan Rickman) aren't quite sure is she's the 'real' Alice.Working with a script by Linda Woolverton (who wrote Disney's BEAUTY AND THE BEAST), Burton's 'Alice' is rooted in the world Carroll has imagined, but it has NARNIA and LORD OF THE RINGS in its blood. A warrior Alice may not be what Carroll had in mind with the character, but for Burton's darker and more mature 'Alice', it's an adequate coming-of-age for the character; everything that the story calls for. In other words, Alice in converted into another typical Burton figure; extraordinary yet misunderstood. Familiar characters from the original text are given much more light here, not to mention the much-anticipated performance by Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter. It could have been a one-note, crazy performance by a gifted actor, but both Burton and Depp have done more. Scenes like the Hatter in deep depression when he tells Alice of what happened to Underland, adds gravity to the often hysterical character from the original stories. With her strong-willed spirit and her classy accent, newcomer Wasikowska is a perfect fit for Alice. But when it comes to the scene-stealing performance, Helena Bonham-Carter's over-the-top Red Queen wins every scene she's in. Supporting performances by Anne Hathaway (White Queen) and Crispin Glover (Knave of Hearts) are welcome touches. The film looks good on 3-D (more so on IMAX), and not because of the several 'in-your-face' sequences, but because it enhances the experience; it immerses us into the (pardon the term) wonderful world Burton has created. The music and production design are all spot-on.This a different and even darker ALICE than you remember. Do see ALICE IN WONDERLAND not as a straight retelling but as a stand-alone effort. Here Burton proves time and time again that the worlds he create are just as vast as his own imagination.Rating: ***** out of 5.",8,4,8,19 March 2010
The Mummy Returns," A second look: THE MUMMY RETURNS
","My Take: A ripping old-fashioned adventure with excessive special effects galore, but a lot of fun. Sequels have always been a part in Hollywood entertainment, most especially summer blockbusters. What we have here is a sequel, once again, to a surprise blockbuster hit. The film was THE MUMMY, which became one of the biggest hits in 1999. With more than a million bucks for another movie, writer/director Stephen Sommers is back for THE MUMMY RETURNS, with bigger plans, bigger budget and, of course, bigger special effects.THE MUMMY RETURNS has the usual trappings for a summer movie. Big special effects mainly. This one has more special effects than the first film. We get to see more than just mummies coming to life, or sand taking form of the large gaping face of a monster. This time, director (Sommers) brings out everything his imagination has brought up. The story seemed to be more than a decoration, rather than the special effects, which suddenly turn up as one of the films main target. It has special-effects over story and intelligence, but what do you expect from a summer action movie (a sequel, no less). I enjoyed THE MUMMY RETURNS, like all summer flicks, for what they are.Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz are back as Rick and Evy, who's out to defend the earth, once again, from the mummy Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) who is resurrected to fulfill a prophecy, to slay the legendary Scorpion King (played briefly by The Rock), and gain control of the Army of Anubis and gain full immortality.The film has overtones of a horror story, but really is a big, bustling action movie. Obviously inspired by the INDIANA JONES series, like the first film, this film boasts a lot of daredevil action stunts, some totally unbelievable. A large suspension of disbelief is required, but the action sequences, as are the special effects, are so wildly exciting and silly (embracing the slight absurdity of a n old B-movie serial) that they are simply destined to please the eyes, and that's what they do, in spades.Best of all, it's that great new summer action movie, yet it embraces elements from the past. Like the first movie, it ain't art, but it's a well-written strictly old-fashioned adventure, providing chills, action and a lot of laughs. Sommers and his crew truly understood what the original such a hit. It wasn't a brilliant piece of movie-making, and neither was it a realistic lesson in archeology. It was big-time fun. Though it needed the most skillful special effects money can buy, THE MUMMY RETURNS proves that the good old times of action adventures are not extinct. In a time when very few of these kind of movies are being made, it's nice to see one done right. (and if you ask me, that's everything a long-time fan of INDIANA JONES, like me, could ever ask for). I think THE MUMMY RETURNS is just as good as the original.Sure it's a purely silly action-adventure of B-movie quality. Sure it aspires to be mocked. But that's just it, no matter how silly and overblown this movie is, it never forgets to laugh at itself and just have fun with it. Rating: ****1/2 out of 5.",9,1,1,5 October 2007
Avatar," Cameron is still the king of this or any other world!
","My Take: A jaw-dropping and visually-thrilling experience. An event movie that lives up to the hype.Watching and judging a movie primarily on its special effects would seem like a shallow way to look at movie-making, but for movies like James Cameron's latest AVATAR (A pet-project of his since he became 'king-of-the-world' in TITANIC), you can't help but get carried away by the brilliant visual magic in place. But I mean that in the best way, because you don't only see AVATAR as an event movie, you experience it as an event itself. Since I saw the movie in Digital 3-D, I don't know how AVATAR would fare in 2-D. But I'll have you this: 3-D is the best possible way to see this movie, if not THE only way to see it. The last time I saw a movie on 3-D was the awful G-FORCE, which had me exhausted with wearing those glasses in the first 15 minutes (let alone, 88 minutes). Well, I wore those glasses for almost three hours in AVATAR, and I never got tired. Here's a movie where 3-D doesn't only enhance the already impressive effects, it also enhances the story into a full-blown experience.I've heard a lot of people (critics mostly) complaining that the plot was mundane, but Cameron was the first to admit that this would be an old-fashioned adventure story. Along with the many old-fashioned stories, there are also several allusions to Cameron's ALIENS, 2007's BATTLE FOR TERRA, KING KONG, DANCES WITH WOLVES, and even POCAHONTAS as well as some of the 'save the rain forest' elements of FERNGULLY: THE LAST RAINFOREST. At first, Sam Worthington had me a little nervous as the hero, but he turned out to be just fine as Jake Sully, a paraplegic wheelchair-bound Marine who must continue his brother's task to study the inhabitants of a beautiful yet dangerous moon called Pandora called the Na'Vi, by infiltrating their environments by means of replicates called Avatars. Their mission is to study these humanoid natives so that the company he serves will know how to extract Unobtainium, a precious rock-like material, hidden somewhere in the moon. But this is just the movie's McGuffin as the story focuses more on Jake's love for the beautiful forests of Pandora, his appreciation for its culture, his romance with a Na'Vi warrior Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) and eventually the battle to save the planet from the greed of humanity.Cameron has been known to push the envelope in his movies, but after TITANIC (still a placeholder for #1 highest-grossing movie of all time), how could he possibly top anything that he had done before? Well AVATAR not only lives up to the hype before it, it may have even surpassed it. AVATAR has been dubbed a 'game-changer', and visually, it might be. The technology used in AVATAR is not only impressive, it might just change the way we see movies in the future (if ever this would be topped). Motion-capture has been done several times before, but (maybe with a few exceptions) no other film has done it so perfectly. The CGI avatars (so to speak) are not some dead-eyed CGI critter, you care for them as if they were more human than the actual flesh-and-blood characters on-screen. Cameron not only waited for the right technology to make AVATAR (this was supposed to be done back in 1999 after TITANIC, but the technology wouldn't allow it), he made sure it was perfect. Call him a perfectionist, but don't say he doesn't succeed. But you'd think, with all the visual hokus-pokus he had in his hands, Cameron might just be another George Lucas. But his years in hiatus has not stopped him from being a professional storyteller. Old-fashioned or not, he tells the story in the most spectacular way possible. From the opening scenes to the spectacular, eye-popping finale, AVATAR never lets up for 3 hours (actually, 162 minutes). It's gonna be hard to top this one, maybe even for Cameron himself!

Grindhouse," Two movies for the price of one!
","My Take: Takes on Z-grade sleaze with style, panache and over-the-top glee, GRINDHOUSE is great night at the movies.I wasn't born when Grindhouse cinema was in fashion, yet judging by the terrific time I had with Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez's GRINDHOUSE special, I guess I didn't have to. Bursting with the love and at the same time mockery of the directors to their inspiration, GRINDHOUSE is a wild ride, a fun and surprisingly original time at the movies. Anyone wanting to dust off some nostalgia will absolutely feel at home here. But even others only wanting a swell movie-going experience won't feel so alienated. Okay, so I didn't exactly see the actual full GRINDHOUSE double-feature, but I did see each film separately (now on DVD) and I manage to pick up the rest of the fake trailers myself on the internet, completing the Grindhouse experience. 'The Fake Trailers': In addition to two full mock-Grindhouse features, there are four fake trailers to add to the Grindhouse experience. They're authentic, yet self-mocking at the same time. And that's the treat. However, like the two features, there have their differences. Finally, I get to review a trailer (sort of) instead of simply including them in a review of some movies, saying they are sometimes better than the films they endorse.'Machete': Robert Rodriguez's fake trailer comes first, 'endorsing' a hit-man movie, the sort of hit-man flick now considered as curiosity pieces just because of their awfulness. Rodriguez knows that, so he picks Danny Trejo to play a Mexican assassin-for-hire who is framed, left for dead and now demands revenge. Rodriguez truly captures the feel of an old, sleazy 70's trailer (complete with the typical announcer) with a welcome sense of mockery. It's pretty violent of course, but starts becoming hilarious when Cheech Marin as a priest appears with a shotgun. A terrific take, but like most trailers to real bad movies, it's better left a trailer. Rating: ****.'Werewolf Women of the SS': My favorite of the fake trailers, Rob Zombie's take on soft-porn exploitation films is often sick and sleazy on one hand, but has its share of hilarious mockery on the other, while having an authentic feel of the actual thing. Udo Kier is a welcome face as a Nazi officer (what else?!) and Nicolas Cage in a hilarious appearance as (I hope you're sitting down!) Fu Manchu! Who knew? Rating: ****1/2.'Don't': The trio of one of my favorite funny men (director Edgar Wright and actors Simon Pegg and Nick Frost) bring what ironically is the spookiest of the four. Wright's take on B-haunted house movies is alternately funny and scary attempt, but the 'scare' part seemed more evident to me. Nonetheless, Nick Frost makes a welcome (if pretty disturbing) cameo and Wright's mockery is still evident. But if you think this is the best of the fake trailers, don't!! Rating: ***.'Thanksgiving': The worst of the trailers in my opinion. A sick, violent take on the slasher sub-genre by the one-and-only Eli Roth. His trademark gruesomeness is evident on-screen in a montage of one gruesome scene after another, presented in trailer form. I don't really know when this film stops being gross and starts not taking itself seriously. Though, he does capture the feel of the authentic trailers in was inspired from. That alone might inspire a small giggle, but then, in comes another stab with the knife! And don't get me started on how this thing ends! Rating: *.",9,0,1,23 April 2009
Mission: Impossible," A second look: MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE
","My Take: An underrated big-screen version of the classic TV series. The plot no longer confuses after a second view. A thrill-a-minute machine.At first glance, MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE is quite like a self-constructing Rubix cube which finishes itself in the finale, but it rarely remains clear how it got there. But after seeing it again the other night, it became clear to me that MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE wasn't quite as complicated nor convoluted, considering how much complicated other espionage thrillers of this kind have turned out to be. Do yourself a favor: Turn your brains in the 'on' position, keep your ears on the listen and wallow in the action-packed, special effects-laden summer entertainment.The plot itself is a thing of beauty. Where else can you see such a plot that moves from manhunts to double cross, and more secret agent/conspiracy jargon one summer viewer can possibly handle. So go get your glass of water or something, for you wouldn't wanna miss a single strand of detail in this complex summer popcorn action thriller of the adults. Tom Cruise is still terrific as the famed (and framed) IMF (Impossible Mission Force) agent Ethan Hunt, point-man to IMF director Jim Phelps (Jon Voight, taking over the role from Peter Graves) during a mission to retrieve a NOC (Non-Official Coverts) list, before it goes out in the open, exposing IMF agents from their aliases. After an ambush which spelled certain failure of the mission, Hunt is framed as the suspected moll working for illegal arms dealer named Max (Vanessa Redgrave). To clear his name, Hunt goes over the edge. Whether it has him breaking into CIA secretly while dangling atop the ceiling, or take form of numerous disguises that would make any fan of the original series proud.The plot gets much more complicated than it sounds, since writers Robert Towne, David Koepp and Steve Zaillian throw in every situation and plot twists it could. The result, while admittedly thick, is clever and gripping. Director Brian DePalma owes more to Alfred Hitchcock than Bruce Gellar, as the film is more thriller than action, but the film works as an exciting piece of entertainment. Clever, fast and and is especially great at keeping the audience guessing. The cast is especially great, even if they aren't exactly Oscar-caliber. Cruise is an especially reliable hero, Voight makes an excellent replacement for Peter Graves (unsatisfied to reprise the role for this film) and Henry Czerny plays another mysterious government figure (after CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER) as Eugene Kittridge. French beauty Emmanuelle Beart sizzles as Phelps' wife Claire and Ving Rhames & Jean Reno play disavowed agents recruited by Hunt to pull off the 'Mt. Everest of hacks'.Nothing is at it seems in this film, since DePalma pulls of everything with gusto, Hitchcock-style. Espionage, thrills, and that slam-bang finale (a fight on a speeding bullet train, having a helicopter fly through a tunnel). DePalma also doesn't drown the film with as much special effects as other summer movie rivals, resulting in one of the more promising piece of unadulterated adult summer attraction.

Saw," Far from what the hype has made it look.
","My Take: A few good moments, but not exactly as great as its hype has made it look. I'm giving SAW a mixed review. The film has some very unique ways to scare you out of your seat, until they just made it too bloody and just messed up the the ending. The film starts out pretty well, following the strange, gloomy and gory traditions of other serial killer films like SILENCE OF THE LAMBS and SE7EN, it also gets pretty good on the second act as well, but the third act, which is very long, is messed up and, I believe, they got bored for most of it and just gave it the 'kill them badly' treatment. SAW is not a bad movie, and far more entertaining than I expected it to be, but then again, there are very big flaws that prevent me to give it thumbs up.The film opens in a terrific gloom when surgeon Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) and hired photographer named Adam (played by Leigh Wannell) are chained in an old cell, which looks exactly like an old bathroom with a voice in a tape recorder giving them strange instructions in how to survive. The voice comes from serial killer called 'Jigsaw' (inspired from the markings he puts to dead victims). Unlike any serial killer, Jigsaw doesn't kill his victims Jason Vorhees-style, he allows them to try to survive he's twisted challenges or die trying, killing themselves. This time, for his latest victims, he gives him strange instructions to kill his fellow cell mate, in order to keep his wife and daughter alive. This is, of course, the twist, which I grant you will be effective.The film then goes on with some rather interesting moments of suspense (minus the excessive blood and guts scenes), and even the flash backs, which rather detract from the main plot, are rather interesting. But, it seems like director James Wan wanted to finally end his film with a lot of things that just comes out of his head. Either blood sport that aren't totally quite as creepy as its strange revelations and suspense. And then of course, there is the ending. I mean, how could something that starts out pretty good end in such a way that the producers wanted more and the audience having enough. I would give away the ending for the sake of some who haven't seen it, but I will say my reaction to this conclusion. Let say that the characters in this film remain interesting to start with, but it all falters when they just wanted to end it with a lot of blood. This concept is very annoying, and I don't appreciate it for that.Do I recommend SAW? Sure, as long as your stomach can take the intensity and your brain can handle the unsatisfying ending. Since there is a SAW II, you (for those who haven't seen it) already have a hint that there will be an open ending. Rating: **1/2 out of 5.",5,1,1,18 October 2007
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," Not as good as the first, but at least it's a lot better than the other sequels.
","My Take: Not as good as the first, but not as bad as they say. Like the first film, I also give this a four-star rating for a job well-done. Director Chris Colombus really shows great talent on producing ideal family films. The laughs are as effective as always and, like the original, it doesn't forget to integrate great family values. This time around, little Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin) isn't home alone, he's lost in the Big Apple, and he has his dad's credit card and cash to give him the ultimate vacation, until The Wet Bandits, Harry (Joe Pesci) and Marv (Daniel Stern), show up, and plots a big Christmas heist.Okay, it isn't very different to or better than its predecessor, but at least it's better than the other two sequels. Because unlike them, the producers don't just shoot the film, they shoot it with the same charm as its predecessor. It's certainly much better than 'Home Alone 3', with the whole silly plot about the microchip. I haven't seen 'Home Alone 4' yet, but from what I've read about it, it's definitely awful. So watch the first two most importantly. You can watch the other two, at your own risk.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",7,0,0,4 May 2007
Up," UP is what going to the movies are all about.
","My Take: Pixar has done it again in this brilliant, imaginative and heartwarming animated adventure.I've always admired Pixar's works, from their debut in TOY STORY to their later works like RATATOUILLE and WALL-E. I like their talents in telling a good story, the brilliant animation and their own unique style. But as their movies keep getting better every time, my affection for them deepens. I still like the animation and the story-telling, but over the years, they have given me more reasons to like them. But their latest works like WALL-E and the subject of this review UP has pretty much summed up one of the things I truly love about their films: It's how they manage to get you even in those smaller moments of their movies. Their movies always have wonderful stories to tell, but even some of their small scenes, like when WALL-E was listening ram shackling some interesting 'trash' for example, provide small moments of wonder and curiosity. Their latest film UP has a lot of these scenes, particularly what happens earlier in the movie.The movie opens with an adventurous boy named Carl Fredricksen sitting in a theater watching the adventurous of his hero Charles Muntz, an adventurer in a quest for Paradise Falls, a land lost in time. But after being convicted about being a fake by his critics, Muntz disappears in search of proof. Meanwhile, Carl finds his match in Ellie, a little girl who shares his passion for adventure and the quest for the legendary Paradise Falls, which she intends to be the site for her new clubhouse. Carl and Ellie swore that they'd be best friends forever, and one thing led to another: they become closer friends, grow up, fall in love, got married and enjoyed a fruitful, happy, often problematic life, but with the quest for the legendary falls still somewhere in their minds. For 70 years, the two of them spent the greatest adventure of their lives, until Ellie dies leaving Carl a sad and rather empty man. This may not be the story of UP, but for those early 30 something minutes of the film, UP already has my vote for the best movie of the year.If the film had the power to make the audience laugh and cry in the first hour, I was dying to know what happens afterward. Carl ends up being an old, lonely man (voiced by Ed Asner) still living in the house he and Ellie built, in spite of heavy construction being built around his home. But when he was forced to go to a retirement home, his passion for adventure kicks back in. He ties a million balloons to his house and sends it flying to South America in search for Paradise Falls. Along for the trip is eager 8 year-old wilderness explorer Russell (voiced by Jordan Nagai), whose reluctant to get his 'Assisting the Elderly' badge. Along the way, they meet danger, a rare giant bird, a dog with a voice-translating collar, and a familiar hero in his older years.UP was released at a late time here in the Philippines, and didn't really stay for too long in theaters which is too bad. This is probably the best film I've seen all year, and probably one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. UP is not contended with just being cute as other animated movies of its kind do; the story is told the way it was supposed to, regardless of how dark and mature it might be for the younger audiences (the scenes involving the Ellie's demise may be a bit too heartbreaking for small fry). It doesn't matter whether or not there are gonna be toys or McDonald's tie-ins, the movie alone is already worth a million viewings. It's certain the movie will grab just as much audiences on DVD as in Pixar's other movies.

National Treasure," Cheesy, silly but enjoyable 'Raiders' knock-off.
","My Take: As over-the-top as it may be, this summer movie is enjoyable and actually not as idiotic as it might have been. There's no doubt the plot of NATIONAL TREASURE is ludicrous and just plain silly, but who said it can't be fun? Although it's incredibly silly and the plot is mostly lifted from Dan Brown's THE DA VINCI CODE, it's still quite fun, and it really doesn't take itself way too seriously, so why should you? NATIONAL TREASURE probably knows it's dumb, if not, why shouldn't it? This is not the material that one should apply logic to. It is what it is, a silly dumb summer blockbuster. Check your brains at the door, grab a tub of popcorn and have a ball.Nicolas Cage probably wanted to take a rest from the Oscars and plays a pedestrian role as obsessed explorer Ben Gates, who has spent much of his life in search of a treasure long been searched by his family legacy, as we were told by his grandfather (Christopher Plummer, in a cameo) at flashback during the beginning of the movie. For his whole life, Gates has not thought about anything else but to look for this treasure. Uh... hasn't anyone recommended this guy to get a job? Anyway, Gates search leads him to a series of mind-bending clues which, due to his expertise (or shall I say obsession) on history, he gets by them really quickly. His configurations are impressively clever, but when it comes to his solutions at the start, but the gets pretty overblown as it goes.In fact, NATIONAL TREASURE isn't just full of these overblown plot twists, it's also filled with clichés and plot holes that almost built around the entire film. Whether it's clichés from recent action films, or clichés that date back to the old times where they eventually came from in the first place. This is, actually, an outmoded piece of old-fashioned escapism. But who said it can't be fun being that way? This is a mildly engaging, silly adventure film. It's old-fashioned to the extremes, and it doesn't have the same touches of greatness that fills the nostalgia of RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, the film which this one obviously wanted to be, but it has it's neat touches and it is quite an efficient little action thriller. Silly, but silly fun just the same.Rating: *** out of 5.",6,1,1,29 May 2008
The Da Vinci Code," Despite some of its self-indulgence, a great romp.
","My Take: A well-crafted and intriguing adaptation, Howard's self-importance notwithstanding. After being a bestseller for many years, as well as being familiar to any literary adult, THE DA VINCI CODE arrived in theaters as one of 2006 biggest and most anticipated blockbusters. Directed by Academy-award winner Ron Howard and written by screenwriter Akiva Goldsman (whose works range from good ones like THE CLIENT and A BEAUTIFUL MIND to bad ones like BATMAN & ROBIN), THE DA VINCI CODE is bound to make a killing at the box-office, despite the fact that a lesser movie would have got better reviews than this did. I may be one of the very few people who hasn't read Brown's novel, but judging this, as a film, it's pretty good. So it does go on for two hours (some scenes look as if Howard was grooming this one up for an Oscar), but I was never bored. Tom Hanks is just right as Robert Langdon, a symbolist sent to investigate the murder of a museum curator, who has strange markings written all over his dead body. The curator's granddaughter Sophie (Audrey Tautou) joins Langdon as he tries to configure a series of clues hidden in Da Vinci's paintings as well as other clues that could lead to a discovery that might change religion as we know it. Along the way, he is pursued by the French police Dept. lead by a Captain Fache (Jean Reno). Ian McKellen co-stars as Sir Leigh Teabing, a wealthy historian (and provides the best character in the film), as well as Paul Bettany as a tormented monk with a gun (Yeah! A gun.).The film lacks the excitement it immensely requires. Although there are a certain amount of good car chase scenes, some of them are long and makes the film's already overlong run time longer. It's still good however, with its endless slew of code-crackings and riddle-solving (I was waiting for Indy Jones' father to ask 'This is what you call archeology?' at any moment). There's a number of very intriguing plot turns, although the ending is still ludicrous. I haven't read Brown's novel, but the film ain't that bad at all. Catholic controversies aside, THE DA VINCI CODE is pure cinema, and not to be taken too seriously, and enjoy it for what it's worth.Rating: **** out of 5.",8,1,3,14 May 2008
Titanic," TITANIC has become one of my favorite films of the 90's.
","My Take: An indisputably sweeping epic. A future classic? It should be.(This is an extension of the review I wrote in February 2007)Every so often, a magnificent epic would just take you away from all that and just sweep you by your feet. James Cameron's unbeatable, $200 million TITANIC is exactly that film, so it just upsets me why some people still don't get it.I was just wondering, it compelled me more than any other film I've seen for quite awhile (not to mention, it won 11 awards in the Oscars and scored high in the box-office), but why some people try to act cynical and bash this wonderful motion picture (This film is rated 7/10 here on IMDb? Come on!). 'Titanic' is really that rare kind of masterpiece we don't usually find in today's film era. It wasn't just a big-budgeted film, it was a truly dramatic and touching tale with an old-fashioned romance that movies like CASABLANCA revolutionized. If movies like that are classics in a way TITANIC wanted to revisit, then may I ask what's wrong? The cast, headed by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, are superb. The direction and writing job by James Cameron is terrific (So is he just getting a hang of the love story thing? I think not!). But one of the real highlights is the superb score by James Horner, and the magnificent theme song. It has become one of my favorite all-time songs. The film too, has become one of my all-time favorites. Not only that, the film is also accurate on some of the facts. James Cameron really made sure to make it as realistic as possible. Like the sinking of the Titanic. Cameron really made that realistic (about the ship splitting in half before sinking). Anyway, combining such elements make it such a winner that won't insult you.I'm sure the movie is not without its imperfections, but when a movie's too good to be true, such elements don't come to you. It never did throughout the immense but utterly sweeping 194 minutes. It's entertainment at its best.Rating: ***** out of 5.",10,3,6,24 February 2007
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," The magic begins!
","My Take: It's every bit a new pop-culture classic. An astounding, magical adventure. Unless you've been living under a rock all your life, you'll know that J.K. Rowling's 'Harry Potter' book series is the biggest thing in the fantasy genre since George Lucas dominated it with STAR WARS. I myself have taken fancy of it, and since I'm a teenager and a big fan of the world Rowling has created, I deeply understand the hype behind it all. The series is very creative with its neat ideas and unique storytelling. The movies, since they were immensely faithful to their source, are just as creative. The series reminded me of the worlds in STAR WARS, since this one takes us away from the bounds of an expensive big-screen movie and transports us to a world unlike reality.I haven't fully read the first novel THE SORCERER'S STONE, which also became the first of many more adaptations of Rowling's other novels. I only read one so far, and it was THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN, which would also later be adapted to the screen, and also my favorite of the bunch so far. Even if you haven't read the novel, the movie is a dazzling array of magical images and stylish storytelling. The surprises and twists aren't all that special, but what is special is what's important. This big-screen adaptation is filled with the best kind of special effects George Lucas' ILM effects house has to offer. It's an eye-feast of spellbinding proportions.I really don't need to dictate what the film is about. If you've been living under a rock and you don't know what it's about, I suggest you just read the book instead. Its deliverance from the book to the movie is not much different. But that's all right, the acting and production values are par excellence. The acting by a veteran cast are terrific, but its the younger cast players that dazzle more. The acting skills of a then-young Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson (who have then grown into the roles) are terrific, with Watson being the best (her Ms. Know-it-all impression is a stand-out). Supporting performances are provided by a line of 'who's who' like Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman and a few others including a host of top British talents that would soon be a staple in the series along with its special effects and astounding sets.I don't have to say this, but here it goes, HARRY POTTER & THE SORCERER'S STONE is magical.

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Magic, monsters, and young love. One of the best in the series.
","My Take: The Harry Potter series is growing up with its audience. This is a visually-stunning, but above all a witty and mature adventure. In his fourth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, our young Mr. Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is faced with the new challenge: He is 'accidentally' included in the dangerous and competitive Tri-Wizard Tournament, a dangerous competition in which students from other schools will challenge each other in order to win the legendary Tri-Wizard cup and eternal glory. Harry, who is too young to be appointed in the competition, is thrown into perilous situations, whether it's retrieving a golden egg from a dragon's lair or saving his friends from the clutches of mere-people. But the danger is far more dangerous than the competition itself. Who put Harry's name in the fabled Goblet of Fire? Is Lord Voldemort at the brink of resurrection now that his loyal servant, the double-crossing Petegrew (Timothy Spall) is exposed and awakening Voldemort's minions? Is Harry getting his first kiss in this movie? By the time the series hit its fourth chapter, the series has moved from director to director to director. First was director Chris Colombus who has given us a sometimes dark, yet mostly heartwarming fantasy adventures. Then it's passed on to director Alfonso Cauron, a brilliant visionary, who crafts a deeper and more interesting adventure than Colombus' already wondrous dimensions. Now, HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE, is appointed to the loving hands of Brit director Mike Newell, who has great British films as FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL and ENCHANTED APRIL to his credit. Since the POTTER films are usually associated with British actors, the director and material fit. On the unfortunate side however, Newell didn't top neither Cauron's AZKABAN nor Colombus' CHAMBER (Both my favorite movies in the series). But there's one thing in Newell's take that they lacked, and that's the show of maturity in its characters. AZKABAN only hinted that our characters are growing up, but GOBLET confirms it. The effects and action sequences are good and all, but perhaps my favorite scene in GOBLET is the Yule Ball sequence where we not only see are characters all grown up, but set aside magical goings-on for a little young love. After all, since the kids are growing up (and the audience is growing up with them), the series needs to catch up. The action still sustains the audience, whether it's being chased by a dragon, battling with gruesome mere-people or passing through a perilous hedge maze, HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE is wild roller-coaster ride populated by clever special effects and fast pacing, but moving not too fast enough to disregard some of the tender moments.Rating: ***** out of 5.",10,0,1,2 January 2009
The Happening," Put it this way: If you like Shymalan, it's worth a look.
","My Take: Bizarre and sometimes campy, but can be chillingly effective if it has to be.As I am a fan of M. Night Shymalan, my first impression of his latest film THE HAPPENING being a 'fun b-movie' as he puts it is that it wouldn't turn out to be as bad as many critics put it. Shymalan, in an attempt to revive his success after the failure of LADY IN THE WATER (an argument that is still goes on among few defenders and haters), just wanted to make a simple B-movie genre effort in an attempt not to alienate some of his viewers from the different and misunderstood nature of his previous efforts, an effort that is still being shrugged by critics. But even a B-movie to Shyamalan is still a film that is faithful to some of the nature of his previous efforts. Most evidently, the use of suspense rather than typical scares.The opening sequence is probably the best. It opens in Central Park, where people go about their usual business when suddenly people find themselves committing suicide in the oddest of fashion. Shymalan, given the full liberties of an R-rating, devises this opening sequence in an over-the-top fashion, yet as well in such effective creepiness that it makes your skin crawl nonetheless. Unfortunately, in spite of a few other disturbing kills later, the rest of the film fails to live up to its admittedly chilling setup. I praised Shymalan before as a superior yet underrated storyteller, but it seems in THE HAPPENING, disturbing and well-crafted sequences aside, fails to live up to some of his superior works, even if, taken in its own merit, is not half bad compared to what the critics have said about it.Firstly, the narrative is rather messy, with no real beginning (after the superb opening sequence, there's hardly a character setup) and an ending with no real closure. Everything just seems to be, pardon the pun, happening. Performances are uneven, with Wahlberg alternating from frantic to campy, either way it's hard to believe him as a science professor when he starts getting silly. Zooey Deschanel is just out of place, a great actress as she is. Some actors like John Leguizamo, Spencer Breslin, Alan Ruck and others are in the cast too, but it's hard not to credit them as nothing more than cameo appearances; they're hardly there, whether or not they serve any real purpose. Finally, Betty Buckley appears later in the film in a relevant supporting role (even if she's only there for, say, 20 minutes) as the out-of-her-mind Mrs. Jones.THE HAPPENING is Shymalan's weakest film to date, not that I'm comparing it to any of his ever-varying works. But being an admirer of his works, every underrated work of his after THE SIXTH SENSE, THE HAPPENING has it's strong points and some effective moments that live up to the director's form. The cinematography by Tak Fujimoto perfectly captures the shots and one-take sequences that Shyamalan demands. James Newton Howard provides yet another terrific, if often ham-fisted, score. Suffice to say: If Shymalan is your cup of tea, this one is well worth watching. I, for one, am looking forward to what he'll come up with next.Rating: *** out of 5.",6,2,4,10 January 2010
The Untouchables," Welcome to Chicago.
","My Take: A fierce, violent and visually-stunning take on the Prohibition-era 'City at War' Chicago. (This is an extension of the review I wrote in July 2008)As I said in originally in this review, I liked THE UNTOUCHABLES the first time I saw it. I loved the performances, loved the superb production design, loved the directing and loved how the pace was kept at the right speed. But it was only when I currently revisited Brian DePalma's gangster classic did I truly appreciate it as a brilliant masterpiece. Perhaps its true that its better the second time around! After introducing us to 'His little friend' SCARFACE, a remake of the classic gangster film, director Brian DePalma voyages again on yet another bold and challenging project. THE UNTOUCHABLES is a violent and daring recapturing of the famous TV series of the same name, which chronicles the days of the Prohibition era, the days of gang kingpin Al Capone and stalwart agent Elliot Ness who vows to bring Capone down. Kevin Costner is decent as Ness, who miserably fails in his attempts to bring down the powerful kingpin, until taken under the wing of one of the films best actors, Sean Connery as Malone. Robert DeNiro is marvelous as the corrupt Capone and little-known actor Billy Drago is creepily effective as Capone's deadly accomplice. Andy Garcia and Charles Martin Smith provide small but dignified support. So far, may be one of DePalma's finest. It's good-looking, breathtaking and boldly violent entertainment, armed with an intelligent script by Pulitzer-winner David Mamet. Still a must-see classic!

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Better than the fantastic original.
","My Take: A fantastic special effects-laden adventure that's better than the original. One of the best in the series. While I read only few parts from THE SORCERER'S STONE, I even read less in the second chapter in the series, HARRY POTTER AND THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS. But, like the original, this adaption doesn't harm viewers that didn't read the book before purchasing the ticket. It's very faithful to the novel like the first film, but what a surprise! This is better than the original. While its heavy faithfulness leaves less room for surprises, this one has more cinematic edge. The action scenes are more exciting, and the magical sequences are more spellbinding than ever. Fans have no doubt enjoyed it, and who am I to disagree. I loved this movie, and it may just become a favorite. For the story, I suggest you read the book instead. There's few point in writing a summary if most of you already know what it's about. I will point out the finest scenes and plot points. While this is just as filled with special effects as the first film, these effects are just as imaginative. Although the goal is to make them more magical than the effects in the first film, they haven't left the imagination behind. The wonder is there also. In sequences with the special effects, they're made more believable by the presence of wonder and awe. There's also excitement of the high order. Even if you have read the book, the thrills will get to you. Sequences like when Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) and Ron (Rupert Grint) are chased by giant spiders, riding a flying car, battling a legendary killer Basilisk is especially exciting and thrilling.Once again, there's also good acting. The all-star supporting cast are back, with the addition of Kenneth Branagh as the boastful Gilderoy Lockhart and Miriam Margolyes as one of the new professors. The younger actors, including Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson (once again, the best of the bunch) and others, are back, and since they're growing up, their acting skills got even better. The screenplay is faithful, and although it's faithful to the book from cover to cover as possible, there are still a lot of surprises here and there. The production design and costumes are dazzling. Director Chris Colombus, who has worked with Steven Spielberg before (GREMLINS), has certainly learned much to give the series just the same amount of wonder, excitement and humor the way Spielberg himself could have done it. HARRY POTTER & THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS is darker, edgier and better than the first film, and you know that's saying something since I liked the first film a lot. This is in my opinion the best in the series so far, tied with the next chapter in the series HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN. Rating: ***** out of 5.",10,0,1,19 May 2008
Die Hard," When it comes to action, there is no other action cop movie that 'dies harder'.
","My Take: A yardstick in which to measure your explosive summer action blockbuster. When it comes to action, no other action cop movie that 'dies harder'. I'm not going further than saying DIE HARD is one of the best, if not he best, cop movie around. The film starts out slowly, but soon explodes with non-stop action scenes and an edge-of-your-seat pace, without giving less humor for a cause. DIE HARD is among those films I classify as 'Great Action Movies'. These are the action movies that act like roller coasters, wherein the action moves at an incredible pace which forces you to hold on for dear life on the edge of your seat or maybe have you looking for a seat belt on your chair.Much of the charisma and wit comes from the goodness of the film's hero. Of course, this is John McLane, played with real zest by Bruce Willis. Willis gives his character that charm that makes him stand proud and apart from other action heroes (as in Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones). But with every good hero, there's a good villain. And that good villain is Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman), the leader of a terrorist gang who invade a high-rise during a Christmas Eve party to rob a multi-million dollar wealth.Secretly, McLane hides behind the dark corners of the building, taking on the terrorists one by one while also having communications with a downtown cop (Reginald Vel Johnson) who are parading outside the building. And, of course, there is also a major pain-in-the-butt that gets in the way, and that is a downtown Deputy Police chief (Paul Gleason), who is well-colored, but just plain incompetent. I think he's just their to do a set-up which we know will fail, which will definitely result to a lot of explosions or cops getting shot. McLane, of course, provides a few of his fireworks including the use of plastic explosions by throwing them down the elevator or dangling on a rope after an explosion in the rooftop.Yes, DIE HARD is indeed a very busy action picture with some very terrific special effects. Few action movies today, with all the money for effects, work can even topple the fantastic effects here, which were more realistic. Director John McTiernan deserves as much credit as the effects masters and stunt coordinators. He gives the film an incredibly fast pace and keeps the action going, and doesn't forget the humor in the screenplay.When it rummaging around the video store, make sure you get DIE HARD on your list. It's not THE best, but it's a terrific, riveting and sometimes funny action ride that never gets old.Rating: ***** out of 5.",10,1,2,13 October 2007
Psycho," 'A boy's best friend is his mother.'
","My Take: A landmark thriller from the one and only Alfred Hitchcock.Familiar even to anyone who hasn't seen the film itself, from its famous sequence that has been imitated and parodied several times to its undeniable influence in the horror genre, Alfred Hitchcock's PSYCHO has since become a part of cinematic history. But with such influence it has made, you'd think the genuine article has lost its touch. That ain't so. Seeing PSYCHO today, the classic still retains its ability to shock on a first time viewing and to give you the creeps even if you've seen it twice or more times.We all know its influence in the several generations of slasher movies, but what still places PSYCHO is that it's less like the horror films it inspired than another thriller masterwork from Alfred Hitchcock; it's a well-crafted and intelligently written thriller, a quality that has slowly lessened in many of the slashers that have followed. Who could forget Janet Leigh in her performance that would make her famous in horror filmdom (and earn her an Oscar nomination) as the doomed Marion Crane. But any conversation about PSYCHO wouldn't be complete without the mention of Anthony Perkins superb performance as the infamous Norman Bates, a slightly maladjusted owner of the desolate Bates Motel. Perhaps the guys at the Oscar's were simply shocked and shivered by his chilling portrayal to give him the Oscar nomination he most certainly deserved. The supporting performances, especially by Vera Miles, are strong enough to carry the rest of the picture.Everything seemed to be pitch perfect about PSYCHO: As usual, Bernard Herrmann teams with Hitch and provides a chilling score that will forever etched in our memories. The infamous shower scene, while no longer as shocking, is still one of the most expertly crafted sequence ever made; it's use of montage is still being scrutinized and studied by any film student today. George Milo, Robert Clatworth and Joseph Hurley's art direction is superb, from Norman's office parlor inhabited by stuffed birds to the famous Bates residence (complete with a silhouette of Mother in the window) is legendary and relevant to the many goings-on at the mysterious Bates Motel. The black-and-white photography does more than just make the censor approve the film, it also suites the film's ample atmosphere (blood in B&W is creepier than color). All this and so much more (not to mention the first-ever on-screen flushing of the toilet) make PSYCHO the father (or is that Mother) of them all.Rating: ***** out of 5.",10,0,0,6 November 2009
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Transformers 2: Not much more than meets the eye.
","My Take: Bigger and louder, but not entirely better than the original.I've been easy on Michael Bay many times, but he's not exactly the kind of guy I usually expect to deliver something new and refreshing. In a year where summer blockbusters can be a refreshing change of pace like STAR TREK, I may be expecting something more in TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN other than, well, more. More explosions, more action, more Autobots (and Decepticons), bustier babes, louder music. All that and possibly (sigh!) more are in this much-anticipated, most attended new sequel. But in a way, all this can't mask that the movie lacks the same bite of its predecessor. I enjoyed the original TRANSFORMERS for two things: First and most obviously, it absolutely rocked! Second, it gave me the thrill of being wrong. I initially suspected TRANSFORMERS to be a big and obnoxious CGI-fest with everything bad about Michael Bay in a nutshell. Obviously, it wasn't all bad. But unfortunately, I didn't feel that my entire initial impression on this sequel were wrong.Perhaps I'm expecting too much. TRANSFORMERS 2 wasn't exactly made to have a strong story, convincing characters and even the slightest moments of subtlety. It's about explosions, action, special effects that outdo God and, of course, Bay's promise that it would be bigger and better than its successful predecessor. Well, to put it honestly, TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN is merely bigger and louder than its predecessor, but it lacks the amount of effective wit of its predecessor. The original is loaded with action, but it also had a lot of laughs a long the way, as well as a likable charm that touched our inner child. This new movie had the action, and it did have humor, but they feel more like Bay's kind of humor. I'm pretty sure he's laughing every time he gives us as scene where dogs are continuously humping each other (and later, a robot humping the Megan Fox' leg!). I, on the other hand, feel like he was pulling my leg. Not contended with that, he also throws in not one, but two jive-talking robots! One street-talking Jazz in the original I can handle, but two transformers (both voiced by Tom Kenny) talking in jive is one time too many. Thankfully, there are more effective jokes halfway around the movie, when John Turturro's (former) Agent Simmons reappears (sharing some noisy but admittedly hilarious banter with Ramon Rodriguez).Almost all the characters (robot or human) reappear in this one, but sadly they don't come up with the same amount of charm they did in the original. Shia LaBeouf is back as Sam, and he's still in his usual quirky self, but Bay eventually abandons do develop him further once he plummets him to the action-laden story. His love story with Megan Fox (never appearing in the film without wearing really short shorts and shoulder-less shirts) doesn't exactly light up some city blocks, no matter how hot Bay wants it to be. And, a similar complaint in the original, the movie is just one hour too long (and if my information serves me right, even longer than the original!). Long movies are nothing to me, but what to fill in those hours is something to point out. The original TRANSFORMERS is too long, to be sure, but some of the excess hours are spent right. In this sequel, Bay just couldn't resist how neat his fight sequences are, so he merely repeats them, only bigger the second or third time around, again and again, until he wraps it up with the biggest he can pull off. The film could have been easily be trimmed for better effect.Still, although I had a lot of nitpicking to do, it is what it is. Loaded with special effects and non-stop (whether I like it or not) action, TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN did make a lot in the box-office (which might guarantee another sequel sometime in the future). Suffice to say, if you liked the first, this will be your cup of tea. Rating: ** out of 5.",3,2,7,29 June 2009
War of the Worlds," Makes INDEPENDENCE DAY look like the Fourth of July.
","My Take: A terrifying and exciting version of the classic H.G. Wells tale. Possibly the best version. (This is an extension of the review I wrote in April 2007)Unlike his 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' and 'E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial', Spielberg's adaptation of H.G. Wells WAR OF THE WORLDS doesn't give a peaceful message of aliens being friendly to earth's beings. The aliens here are, to all those familiar with Wells' story (And most thankfully, most are), hostile and couldn't think of any other reasons to land here on Earth, but to destroy it. While WAR OF THE WORLDS might be geared as entertainment, bringing Spielberg back in his days with JAWS and JURASSIC PARK. But upon mastering his skills as a more serious filmmaker in SCHINDLER'S LIST and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, he makes WAR OF THE WORLDS a much darker experience, making it more effective and more frightening. Spielberg shares Wells' vision in a tale of an invasion on earth by emotionless aliens. This is thrill-master Spielberg at his best. The camera focuses mainly on Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise) and his family, who are forced to leave their home, and run for their lives after an gigantic tripod emerges from the soil and destroy everything in its path. The films plot, thankfully, didn't burst into an all-out war that pits man and aliens in the ultimate war. Like what Tim Robbins' character says, 'This is not a war when there's a war between man and maggots... This is an extermination.' That's some of the elements that actually elevate this from other alien invasion films. 'Independence Day' or 'Mars Attacks!' per say. From the first frame to the last, I think it was a wonderful film. The flaws are there, but in favor mind-blowing entertainment and sheer terror, I won't hold them against the film. The special effects on the tripod machines are impressive, not because the CGI is top-notch, but that because how effectively ominous they are. These tripods join the shark from JAWS and the Raptors from JURASSIC PARK as yet another perfect killing machine as only Spielberg could create. If this is not the best adaptation of Wells' classic tale, it's definitely the most frightening. WAR OF THE WORLDS is terrific entertainment. Rating: ***** out of 5.",10,11,21,16 April 2007
Hercules," Gods and Monsters: HERCULES is one of Disney's funniest.
","My Take: The typical masterpiece Disney is capable of. Pure magic! The gods must be funny in this hilarious animated smash from the ever-talented animation artists at Disney. HERCULES, which was released after the studio dared to venture into darker territory with THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME, returns to the kind of light, fun-loving musical adventure. Despite being a magnificent instant classic of its own, THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME proved to be too dark for the usual Disney routine. If that case so, HERCULES is a good throwback to the days of ALADDIN and THE LITTLE MERMAID. It may just be their funniest yet.The movie is a twist on the tales of Greek Mythology, namely the story of the title character (voiced by Tate Donovan), who happens to be the son of the great god Zeus (voiced by Rip Torn) who is robbed of his godly powers and turned mortal... sort of by the evil Lord Hades (voiced with maniacal glee by James Woods). Unfortunate for the hot-headed, comical Lord of the Underworld, Hercules maintained his god-like strength, making him look like a freak in the eyes of everyone else. So young 'Herc' set on a voyage to find his true identity and reclaim his destiny as a god on Mount Olympus. Aiding as his mentor is a tough-mouthed satyr named Phil (voiced by Danny DeVito) and his magical bird-brained Pegasus, while also tempted by a lovely maiden named Meg (voiced by Susan Egan), short for Megara, who may just have a weakness for his 'Wonder Boy''s charms.The magic of Disney's timeless animation is still stirring and imaginative, but the voice cast have never been more appropriate. James Woods was born to play the villain Hades. He basically steals the scenes he's in, if not the whole movie. He may be the bad guy, but you'll like hims so much, he's good! Other than Woods is Danny DeVito, who imbues his familiar voice and personality to his character Phil and comes up with a character that even adults will love. Then there are the lovely singing muses, who tells the series of events through winning musical numbers (reminiscent to the Greek Chorus from LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS).

Ice Age," Scrat steals the show. Everything else is just fine.
","My Take: Nowhere near SHREK on the level of craftsmanship, but amusing and energetic enough. ICE AGE may not be a much for SHREK nor TOY STORY 2, but with fine characters, an appealing (of somewhat familiar) story and terrific animation (fur has never been this accurate), ICE AGE earns its place in the animation milestone. A trio of Pleistocene critters including Manny the moody Mammoth (voiced by Ray Romano), a talkative sloth named Sid (John Leguizamo) and a shady sabertooth tiger named Diego (Denis Leary) come together when they come across a baby Neanderthal whom they plan to bring back to his tribe. While on the other hand, Diego's pack of hungry sabers, led by its vengeful leader (Goran Visnjic), look on the little human as a snack (while also looking at the mammoth as a little bonus).There's really not much of a story, partly being the main plot itself has already been done on MONSTER'S INC., released almost the same time as this film. Basically, it's just an environment-hopping adventure moving from one place to another, encountering critter (a pair of grumpy rhinos) to critter (a flock of dimwitted dodos who plan the biggest hibernation of their lives, with a stock of only three melons). The animation is fairly well, with the computerized fur almost nearing its perfection. The comedy is surprisingly sharp, with great help from the always reliable Ray Romano on the helm. ICE AGE is yet to be on the level of SHREK or other competitions, but it's a fine start for (hopefully) great things to come. Rating: **** out of 5.",8,0,0,3 January 2009
Army of Darkness," Groovy!
","My Take: Some of the slapsticks may grate, but the film is still manic and wildly original. Sam Raimi has never really been one of my favorite directors, but I've got to admit about how stylish he often is when it comes to making his movies. ARMY OF DARKNESS is the third film in the EVIL DEAD series, and since I haven't seen the first two yet, I'm reviewing simply this film, without making references or comparisons to its predecessors. But ARMY OF DARKNESS still does fill the void for those who might not seen the first film, therefore free from confusion.The film isn't related to its predecessors either. For, while the first two films are more of horror films (or a satire of horrors), this one is also an old-fashioned sword-and-sorcery film, complete with cheesy (intentional) dialog and swashbuckling battle scenes. The good thing about it is that Raimi takes it all less seriously, and producing a number of hilarious bits as well.Bruce Campbell reprises his role as the chainsaw-armed store clerk Ash, who is whisked into the Dark Ages, facing rival kingdoms and the army of the dead along the way. To get him back home, he must retrieve the Necronomicon, the cursed Book with the Dead, which can also prevent a small kingdom from being invaded by the 'Deadites'. It ends up with a final confrontation against the army of Deadites when they are awakened by their lust to get the Book of the Dead back.Cheesy isn't it? But that's just the point. ARMY OF DARKNESS aims for a mockery, and it does a great job and rewards greatly. It's a lot of fun, with lots of in jokes and its own jokes, thanks greatly to the presence of Bruce Campbell, he's effectively funny. The 'low-budget' special effects are fun, and if you think they look cheesy, try saying that to the great Ray Harryhausen, which these effects pay homage to.ARMY OF DARKNESS is filled with dozens of slapstick humor and lack a number of smarter wit, but even so, it's a lot of fun and craziness. Viewers, including eventual fans of the director, will enjoy the films craziness and wit, but more on the macabre style that took to create it. It's an all special effects extravaganza, but not without being an imaginative one.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",7,2,3,7 May 2008
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Sweet 'Vengeance'.
","My Take: Not as good and thrilling as the first, but has all the right ingredients to make it an explosive adventure. Sequels like DIE HARD: WITH A VENGEANCE don't come much around anymore. It's not as good as the ones that preceded it, but it doesn't care about that, all it wants is to be a great, stand-alone action thriller that does what it is intended to do. Granted, it's not as great as the original, or as wildly exciting as the second, but in its own stand-alone way, it delivers thrill after thrill, then, when the explosions calm down, it delivers suspense after suspense. It's like a bomb, when it explodes, it's edge-of-your-seat stuff, when it's not, it's still edgy waiting for it to happen. Since it's a DIE HARD picture, you know there will be an explosion, but it's hidden with a great amount of suspense, you hardly notice how predictable it might have been.Once again, Bruce Willis is back as John McLane, he's divorced and on vacation from his police work in New York. He is, though, called in back when a mad-bombing terrorist has frequently blown-up a couple of New York department stores. McLane, joined by a racist partner, a store clerk, named Zeus (Samuel L. Jackson), they get frequent pay phone calls from a guy named Simon (Jeremy Irons), the terrorist, who has placed bombs after bombs in New York city's train subways, trash cans and many other places, which he uses to play cat-and-mouse with McLane.This leads to a numerous amount of action sequences that are almost twice as exciting as the ones in the previous films. We have a mad dash in Central Park, a race thru a flooding sewer line, a chase/shootout st the streets and a lot of other actions and explosions to keep you busy.Like the first film, DIE HARD: WITH A VENGEANCE is directed by John McTiernan, who, once again, give us an endless supply of action and thrills, and a good dose of comedy and characters as well. Willis' and Jackson's characters never get boring or thin, and Irons' villainous performance makes him the best of the DIE HARD villains in my book. What McTiernan does lack in this chapter is the appeal of its other central character, John's wife Holly McLane, who is completely absent in this film, thus betraying much of the chemistry that they had which actually worked. DIE HARD: WITH A VENGEANCE is not the best of the series and really doesn't catch up with its predecessors, but it's a great entertainment nonetheless and is, in fact, on a league of its own.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",7,0,0,13 October 2007
Con Air," We've seen it before, and just the way I like it.
","My Take: An action-packed guilty pleasure action movie loaded with thrills.Try DIE HARD meets AIRPORT with several elements borrowed from FLIGHT OF THE PHOENIX, THE DELTA FORCE and SPEED and you got the idea behind CON AIR, a completely implausible but nonetheless entertaining action adventure team-up with producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Simon West (in his directorial debut). It's not exactly art, but then again that may guarantee that's pure not-to-be-taken-seriously fun.The plot concerns the hijacking of a prisoner transport plane by one of the nastiest criminals on the planet, led by Cyrus 'The Virus' Grissom (John Malkovich). The rest of the passengers read like a who's who of the criminally insane, like the cast of AIRPORT in hell. We have black militant leader (played by Ving Rhames), a Hannibal Lecter-like psychopath (Steve Buscemi), a rapist (Danny Trejo), a loudmouthed black stereotype/comic relief (Dave Chapelle) and down to a transvestite inmate and all mass murderers as far as the eye could see. Back on the ground, US Marshal Vince Larkin (John Cusack) must rely on paroled ex-convict Cameron Poe (Nicolas Cage) to cease control of the plane. With already such a cast, I was expecting George Kennedy to show up somewhere.Part of the fun is seeing who the movie plays with several clichés of the genre. The clichés are age-old, some dating back to the days of AIRPORT with such a big all star cast (but this time, mostly with character actors). At some point, Cusack tells Cage that 'he's at the wrong place at the wrong time', which will immediately remind anyone of DIE HARD. CON AIR is not exactly strong with plot, with an ending in Las Vegas that could only be described as implausible. (Plus, after all the action, the movie even has time for Trisha Yearwood to warble the theme song 'How Do I Live') Not that it matters, the whole film is not exactly art but it's loads of fun, and I'd be damned if I say I wasn't entertained.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",7,3,4,3 October 2009
Jaws," 'This is not a boat accident...'
","My Take: An overwhelming and unforgettable classic. (This is an extended version of the review I wrote on February 2007)Did Steven Spielberg with his unforgettable classic JAWS invent the term 'blockbuster'? Perhaps not entirely, but here's to be sure: The redefined it. Packed theaters and satisfied audiences proved that JAWS was the ultimate blockbuster. There first of its kind (and by the looks of it, it sure isn't the last).During the heyday of the horror genre during the 70's, there seems to be only one that were above the others. One, were even today, it's still can be remembered by beach-goers who saw it in the theaters during its release. Yes, you've heard it before. 'Duh-duh-duh-duh....'. Upon hearing that theme, you now what your in for.Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss give excellent performances in this classic. Director Steven Spielberg, very young at this time, did his best in directing. And the script is well written, it was like it was straight out of Peter Benchley's novel, which it was based on.This movie is a terrific scare machine for its day, lots of memorable bits and even scary until now if you keep it up your head a lot. Way, way better than the films which tried to duplicate it (not to mention a nice try first sequel, a campy 2nd sequel and a totally awful closure). Is JAWS still the blockbuster to beat? Well, if you judge a blockbuster by gripping suspense, sustaining thrills and a generally unseen shark, then it is. Rating: ***** out of 5.",10,3,7,7 February 2007
Hancock," An interesting take on a superhero-movie comedy.
","My Take: A funny and satirical take on the superhero genre.Before it falls prey to the typical over-the-top effects-heavy summertime entertainment, HANCOCK is a surprisingly fresh take on the superhero genre, which also got a huge makeover at the time with films like IRON MAN and THE DARK KNIGHT. In a way, HANCOCK is a worthy dish to add to the buffet of surprisingly new age summertime comic book movies. Instead of the typical effects-laden movies of its kind (which, actually, is what this film becomes sometime in the second act), HANCOCK is a satire. Instead of your typical superhero origin story, which just get straight to the point: Hancock is an asshole of a superhero, and nobody likes him.For years now, Will Smith has starred in several promising blockbuster (usually coinciding with a 4th of July screening). But his character as HANCOCK is a long way from his roles in INDEPENDENCE DAY and MEN IN BLACK. Just as role in I AM LEGEND was a more serious take on his typical action hero, his John Hancock often calls for him to be totally unlikable. Yes, we have to take him as a total jerk, but then relate to him when the only reason for his actions is that the world isn't exactly a ray of sunshine for him. A public relations professional (Jason Bateman) seeks to change that, just as he seeks to change the world in his little ways. But his wife (Charlize Theron) isn't too comfortable when his husband hangs out with the chaos-prone alcoholic superhero.Although the last act boils down to another effects-heavy blockbuster with dizzying special effects (shot entirely in headache-inducing 'shakycam'), HANCOCK's real appeal is how funny it is. Smith is hilarious in the role, yet we gain sympathy from the character when he wants us to. Director Peter Berg knows how to balance summertime effects gigs and satirical comedy (even if the balance does tip a little in the final act), making HANCOCK a good time if far from an entirely perfect movie. To quote our hero, good job! Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",7,1,2,22 January 2010
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The missing piece in the STAR WARS saga has finally arrived, special effects and good story all included.
","My Take: The darkest, boldest and possibly the deepest STAR WARS chapter since THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. Calling STAR WARS Ep. III: REVENGE OF THE SITH as the last chapter in the STAR WARS trilogy would be a misconception since, chronologically, this is the third chapter in the series, picking up where the first two 'prequels' left off and how the events in the original trilogy began. In other words, this is the much-awaited chapter ever so awaited by the fans. The first two prequels, although wonderfully spectacular, are not what the fans might have expected. Alrthough I did like the prequels and I am defending them from heavy criticism, I must agree that it only gives us hints to what exactly will happen in the original trilogy. Ep. III offers just as much of the appeal I had with the first two prequels, which is mainly the special effects and numerous action sequences, but this time, you can actually see the pieces all coming together, the events slowly leading to the story we all know, but so willing are we to find out how and why it happened.Those events the fans chanted as 'missing' finally takes form here. From the transformation of the once innocent Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) to the evil Darth Vader, the end of the reign of the Jedi, and the much awaited final duel between the mentor and his pupil, Anakin and master Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor). Although the script, only co-written by series creator George Lucas, does have its flaws, with its sometimes muddled romantic lines, marred by a somewhat wooden performance by Christensen as Anakin. But if you can enjoy the 97% of the film that works, which I certify you will, you can can just forget about the 3% that doesn't, which isn't really much, considering how successful (not just on box-office take) the film is. So has was Lucas right in ending it this way? Heck, yes! The cliffhanger ending will have fans and other viewers alike swarming back to video stores to get the latest version of the Star Wars DVDs, something that Lucas has specially prepared for this release, taking a revisit back to those classics. Which is exactly my point. Lucas has made the saga entirely into a get-rich-quick scheme, which is not at all that bad since the products (films and DVDs) were all good, but simply a bit too much now. I liked Ep. III very much, with its darker plot and welcome enjoyment for special effects, but the franchise is a bit of a problem. Lucas should stop here, which would have been great, because, if you know Lucas as much now, finished is never finished. Rating: ***** out of 5.",10,0,3,6 February 2008
The Lion King," Could Disney even do this again?
","My Take: An instant animated classic with dazzling animation and unforgettable storytelling. Success has not been new to the likes of Disney. But, as far as considering their latest works, 'The Lion King' would be their biggest success. The 1990's are full of Disney's great works. Take 'Beauty and the Beast', 'Mulan', 'The Little Mermaid', 'Aladdin' and others. But, as far as animated movies goes, the 1990's is the last year they'd be doing classics like this. Their future animated films mostly range from bad to average, no classics. But if they didn't make animated movies after the 1990's, 'The Lion King' would chronicle their very success. This movie is done in exquisite sort of taste that makes it flawless as a classic. The animation is a breakthrough of Disney's first works, a well-animated scenery of the African wilderness that looks superbly astonishing, that it's almost looks like the Disney creators shot it there. The film also has human relevance. You know that the characters are animals, but they're made with so much appeal and effect, that they're almost human.This will always be a favorite of mine, a story that's full of majesty and colorful that lacked in most of Disney's future animated movies lacked. Purely, it was a bit difficult for Disney to earn the viewers trust back with that appeal nowadays. Ironically, they're the only once who had the most of this appeal back when this was released.Rating: ***** out of 5.",10,0,0,7 June 2007
WALL·E," Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton will absolutely love WALL-E.
","My Take: One of the very best films of the year. An instant classic. The late TV film critic Gene Siskel once said that you can say a lot about a certain character through looking at their eyes. Well, Mr. Siskel would have loved WALL-E, Pixar's latest creation whose head is all binocular-like eyes. Yet they elicit enough emotions to make him almost human. When he's either happy, sad, serious or whatever else, this cute little robot just moves his eyes a bit and leaves the cinematic magic to his creators to give him more emotions than the Tin Man. But enough solely talking about this films lead character, almost everything about WALL-E sums up one of the best films of the year (if only I had seen it on theaters earlier to complete the experience!).WALL-E didn't just charm me, it moved me in mysterious ways. It's beautifully done, crisply animated, yet it's also charming, topical, breezy and breathtakingly soaring. The storyline is beyond anything I've seen in years (try R2-D2 in a holiday-off from STAR WARS to give you an idea about what WALL-E is about). But beyond that, there's something else really special about WALL-E. Because, sometime throughout the film, I started to see myself in the character. Few films are capable of making you see yourself in the character, and just for the films first hour, WALL-E is already movie magic.The first hour of the film is definitely the best, which looks and feels like a silent comedy, introducing us to the film's adorable little robot of the title. 'Waste Allocation Load Lifter-Earth-class' aka Wall-E (voiced with various beeps and hums courtesy of Ben Burtt), the earth's last-functional stuck to his duties to clean up the world's waste while everyone on earth has already evacuated. But after years (better add a few more zeros to a million years) of cleaning up, Wall-E has developed a certain something: curiosity and personality. With no one on earth to keep him company, he takes pleasure in everyday objects like old cassette tapes, a Rubik's cube, a light bulb and a little cockroach who keeps him company. But he's prayers are answered (if robots can pray!) when a ship drops a little probot called EVE, whom he immediately falls in love with... even with those laser weapons at hand. But when EVE is carried away back from her source, the love-struck Wall-E tags along and ends up fighting to resurrect and recolonize earth.The first half, clearly the best part in this movie is a marvelous display of creativity, while the second half is filled with excitement and startling little revelations, and that moving love story between Wall-E and EVE. But the sum of both parts creates the finest animated adventure in a long time. Now sign yourself and your family up for a cruise with WALL-E and have an intergalactic adventure unlike anything in this or any galaxy!Rating: ***** out of 5.",10,3,6,16 December 2008
Back to the Future Part II," A real blast from the past.
","My Take: Wildly elaborate and highly imaginative.This sequel falls where everyone feared the original BACK TO THE FUTURE might fall upon. This sequel is more effects-driven than the first film, and there are more special effects here than the first film. This sequel is not as good as the first film (and that film was very good), with its lack of ingenuity and more focused on the quality of the special effects, but that doesn't mean the special effects delight upon itself. The film is still a lot of fun, and director Robert Zemekis and producer Steven Spielberg's liveliness are at an evident abundance. It is still what a sequel should be.Instead of going to the usual knock-off as any expensive sequel does, the new script by Bob Gale and Robert Zemeckis took some time (no pun intended) to right a new script with still numerous insightfully ingenious ideas, but often too many. The film jumps from the future, where McFly must right a few wrongs that occur with his future family, and then jumps from present to past and the explanation seems confusing that it injures the plot with heavy confusion. Although I wasn't immensely confused by it, but I know I'm not the same as all the audience who've seen it.But, still, there is so much more to enjoy in the film's visual appeal, with special effects that are elaborate and fancy, even if some of which are dated to our standards. Consulting George Lucas' ILM effects house, Zemckis and crew have made this into a very busy enterprise, but one with heart. There's a lot of imagination that went to the special effects, which seemed enough for me to be appealed. What today's special effects throughly lacked are the minds behind them. This time, the effects are well imagined, owing more to those who think them up rather than those who make them fancy.Overall, not your typical sequel. That is, because the very typical sequels are those that try their best while with so little to know about what made their predecessors so good. This one lacks what made the first film so good, but at least it makes an effort to be imaginative. I like it and I heavily recommend it.Rating: **** out of 5.",8,0,0,12 May 2008
Iron Man," 'Yeah, I can fly.'
","My Take: Robert Downey Jr. is the real treat here. Comic-book movies are growing up! After the success of a revamped BATMAN franchise and the SPIDER-MAN pictures which successfully venture beyond its basic premise, it's about time Marvel's metal-suited action hero to get his share of the spotlight. I'm talking about IRON MAN, of course. And it's quite a surprise. Thankfully, IRON MAN doesn't fall on the tragic path of cheesiness and artificiality like the FANTASTIC FOUR pictures. Instead, IRON MAN is nearly as potent and mature as the SPIDER-MAN pictures, although not as dark or sinister as the new BATMAN pictures.That's fine however, since IRON MAN aims for a different approach. It's a comic book adventure for adults. It's mature and geared more to adults than on the little tykes, yet it still has the feel of a comic book movie. It's got flashy action sequences that are lighter than those in Chris Nolan's new BATMAN movies, including a rock 'em sock 'em battle between Iron Man and a larger metal-suited behemoth. It tackles deeper issues than most superhero/comic-book movies (maybe even deeper than the SPIDER-MAN movies), but it never forgets to be fun, even in the forgettable sense. Robert Downey Jr. makes an eccentric Tony Stark, a weapons industrialist and a genius, not to mention a playboy. Think Bruce Wayne meets Nicolas Cage in LORD OF WAR. Ironically, he's a superhero's own worst enemy. He sells nuclear weapons of the best quality. But after being captured by a underground terrorists asking him to re-build a weapon of his to be used against the Americans, he suits himself up with an artificial 'heart' and a metal suit armed to the teeth to blow you apart.From eccentric weapons engineer, Stark finishes his advance armored suit and turns himself into a real man-of-steel of the title, much to the dismay of his superior Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges, who looks exactly like William Hurt in another Marvel-based movie of the year THE INCREDIBLE HULK), who wants Stark Industries to continue producing the latest in weapons technology. Gwyneth Paltrow also stars as Pepper Potts, Stark's assistant. But the real star is Downey Jr., a superb actor who gives deeper dimension to the typical superhero alter-ego. If the explosions and eye-popping special effects will be gone the moment you step out of the theater, the character of Tony Stark will stay with you like a person you just met. The character is funny, eccentric but most of all, memorable. Director Jon Favreau may not stage the action as good as Christopher Nolan's BATMAN pictures or like Sam Raimi of the SPIDER-MAN films, but he handles the characters real well. IRON MAN is a good start for the summer movie season, but it isn't just a while-you-wait blockbuster for THE DARK KNIGHT (arguably the summer's best picture).Rating: ****1/2 out of 5.",9,2,4,2 January 2009
The Emperor's New Groove," Boom Baby!
","My Take: A wacky good time for the whole family. By the time the studio neared their heyday (before they start turning real bad), Disney made this hilarious and fast-aced adventure comedy and even took time to parody their own works. THE EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE is not the best Disney movie, and maybe not even for a long time, but that's alright. It's funny, energetic, colorful and, in some spots, it's actually clever. What more could I ask for? I guess, nothing more. THE EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE may have not brought out the best Disney can offer, but it still clearly shows their capabilities.One of the best pleasures of GROOVE is the ensemble comedic voice acting. The voice cast, which includes David Spade, Eartha Kitt, Patrick Warburton and John Goodman to list the names at the top-billing, are excellent and never lacking in joy and sharp comedic timing. Their comedic performances are more than enough to sustain adult attention, but not without letting the young 'uns down. If you don't find even one of their hilarious mischief at least amusing then you must have your funny bone ripped out of you body and the pain is excruciating. the entire film may not have been a comedic gold mine, but it comes close to rival any non-animated movie above a G-rating. In fact, I say it might put a few others to shame.Spade lends his outrageous voice talents to the spoiled Emperor Kuzco, who is used to his life of royalty (in Kuzco's term, 'Everyone is under my command') since birth (in one hilarious scene, Baby Kuzco accidentally beheads his stuffed toy and soon a large number of hands reach out to him, each with a stuffed toy to give away). See, Kuzco wants to destroy a peasant village set upon a scenic hilltop so he can build his summer getaway home (Complete with water slide!). Despite the lead peasant Pacha's (voiced by John Goodman) attempt to halt construction, Kuzco does get everything he wants, right? So he thinks. After being fired by spoiled brat of an emperor, his 'loyal' adviser Yzma (voiced with great presence by Eartha Kitt), which I may describe as a cross between Cruella DeVille and... well, Eartha Kitt, wants to get even with him. While hitting stone head replicas of him doesn't satisfy, Yzma plots instead to poison the emperor. But her plans failed, mainly due to the complete incompetence of her bumbling right-hand man Kronk (the hilarious Patrick Warburton lends his voice). Instead of a dead emperor, they just have one badly turned into a talking llama. Assisted by Pacha, Kuzco (the llama) tries to get back to the palace and change him back to human.True, some jokes falter and the story isn't first-class Disney story-telling, but I wasn't exactly looking for a smart straightforward Disney effort when the first frame appears before my face. The movie had me from the first frame and again, and again, and again later on. One of the main reasons this movie worked for me was that it packs one frame after another with enough juice to make us wait for the other. The movie is one funny moment followed by another, that's both for the young and old audiences. While kids will enjoy the silly humor and energy-packed madness, adults will find the talented voice cast and the smarter humor a real pleasure. Either way, THE EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE delivers what's coming to you.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",7,0,1,18 October 2008
Casino Royale," 'Royale' treatment
","My Take: Slicker, leaner and badder. James Bond is back, and just as good as ever! Although it's number 22 in the Bond film series, CASINO ROYALE is actually the first Bond movie written by Bond creator Ian Fleming, but I bet you all know that by now. Familiar only as a pre-AUSTIN POWERS spoof with Peter Sellers (which didn't exactly fare well with most critics), this new CASINO ROYALE won't just be a superb new entry in the Bond film canon, this is a spectacular reboot to the series, a new James Bond, and the new Bond, Daniel Craig, fits the bill. He's potent as an action hero as he is an actor.CASINO ROYALE is also a different kind of Bond film, well, at least for a long time. Not since ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE has their been a Bond devoted to script than action, but unlike George Lazenby, Craig provides an above-adequate performance that doesn't make him a tiresome or boring. Due to it's lack of the daredevil and nearly impossible stunt work and action scenes, CASINO ROYALE feels different and fans may find it unsettling, but the substitute is a welcome approach, and it results into one of the toughest, roughest and most seriously satisfying Bond film since 1989's LICENCE TO KILL.The film isn't another mission for Bond, but actually his first mission. After being promoted to 00 status, after successfully assassinating two victims ('to become a 00, you must need two.'), by his boss M (Judi Dench). Bond is sent to find Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen), a banker to the world's most dangerous terrorists, who owes a great deal of money. To earn back his losses, Le Chiffre intends to win it in a poker tournament at Casino Royale in Montenegro. Bond's first mission is to prevent him from winning and win the money, disclosing the names of the terrorists. Along his side is British accountant Vesper Lynd (Eva Green), the beauty that first catches Bond's eyes. Giancarlo Giannini plays Mathis while Jeffrey Wright plays the 'brother from Langley' Felix Leiter.With excitement mostly pitched on poker tournaments and torture scenes (one of the film's most potent and memorable scenes), CASINO ROYALE is both darker and different than the likes of its predecessors. The fact that Bond must successfully assassinate two people before being promoted would seem too dark for the likes of the Bond we knew from Sean Connery, Roger Moore and even Timothy Dalton (who once held the record as the most serious Bond actor). The film's trademark line 'Bond, James Bond' isn't mentioned until the last scene. When pursuing the baddie, Bond does it in style, but very seriously. Hell, Bond doesn't even give a damn if his martini's shaken or stirred! This is not the Bond you've got to know since 1962's DR. NO up to 2002's DIE ANOTHER DAY. No, but this is great Bond. Although serious and often vigilante, Bond is still hammered with humor, making Craig's outing the perfect Bond for the new century.Director Martin Campbell makes a triumphant return to the director's chair after GOLDENEYE, making the film serious yet exciting as possible. The script is dead serious for most of the parts, but doesn't spare us our craving for bits of humor (when M complains about Bond's vigilante ways in pursuit of a bad guy, Bond replies 'Next time, I'll shoot the cameras first') as well as some neat action scenes, notably a chase through an airport that is just as exciting even without being as daredevil. The acting here is even better. Besides Craig, Judi Dench makes an ideal M. If you can ignore the continuity that M is already a lady even before Bond was even a 00, then you'll truly be convinced by this M, a true boss. Ms Green's performance as Vesper ranks as one of the best Bond girl actresses. Although running a long 144 minutes, the film is devoid of boredom. Even with scenes that often lag, the excitement and show-stopping scenes overcome them.I'd rank CASINO ROYALE is one of the best Bond in years, but any comparison, good or bad, I think, would be quite unfair. Being that this is different from its predecessors, it is just right for CASINO ROYALE to be great as a Bond film unlike the Bond films before. With that, CASINO ROYALE is pure, intelligent and well-written entertainment.Rating: ****1/2 out of 5.",9,2,10,5 May 2008
Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs," ICE AGE still far from extinction.
","My Take: It's not the best animated movies have to offer, but with all the charms and laughs of a likable one.Third time's the charm, occasionally. As I loved the first two ICE AGE movies, I admired ICE AGE: DAWN OF THE DINOSAURS solely on its own terms; as pure family fun. Unlike TRANSFORMERS 2, which guises itself as a 'family movie' while gearing itself for an older audience, ICE AGE 3 is a more harmless (not to mention trimmer) family affair, and in my opinion a better diversion if you plan to bring a lot of younger kids along for the ride. That saying a lot for a movie about an inter-species herd of Pleistocene mammals in a ridiculous adventure that has them crossing paths with dinosaurs in a lost underground jungle! If I was 8 years-old right now, I would have absolutely loved ICE AGE 3! The title couldn't be more straight-forward: Our sub-zero heroes get tangled up with an adventure that breaks all plausibility when they find an underground forest inhabited by dinosaurs of all shapes and sizes. As the 'DAWN OF THE DINOSAURS' of its title kicks in, I felt the the 8 year-old in my head bouncing with joy. I don't know, maybe it's been a while when I saw a dinosaur movie (I don't know if the new LAND OF THE LOST, which I haven't seen yet, would be able to give me that same feeling). The animation doesn't break new ground, but for what it wanted to offer, it's colorful and lively, even better perhaps than in the first two movies. If good looks are not good enough ,the movie also offers some exciting action scenes filled with nearly endless visual inventiveness. I should have seen this on 3-D as it was intended to be. This is probably the most visually elaborate of the three.Still, outside the visual astonishment to be had, it does suffer in comparison with its superior predecessors, as any sequel (or more specifically trequel) might. First, which probably deserves a lot of discussion, is the return of the character Scrat. I thought Scrat is one of the most brilliant creations ever in an animated movie since his debut in the first ICE AGE movie (the opening scene was classic!), but during his return in this sequel, he is not given much more to do. I guess the folks at Blue Sky Animation is contended with giving Scrat a love interest, which is none other than Scratte, a female flying squirrel. Perhaps when the DVD comes, Blue Sky will redeem themselves with their priced creation with yet another lovable short feature. The laughs also come in short. While it's s usual complaint that too much cultural references are gratuitous in a kid-friendly animated feature, this film gears itself more on making the kids laugh that adults will probably be left smiling, giggling at best. Still, there are a few gags to be had with Simon Pegg lending his voice to the tenacious Ahab-like weasel named Buck, as well as the familiar voice cast of Ray Romano, Denis Leary, John Leguizamo, Denis Leary, Queen Latifah, Sean William Scott and Josh Peck providing the voices to their respective characters.ICE AGE: DAWN OF THE DINOSAURS is not the best of the three films, and it's not the best animated film either. Superb entries like WALL-E and the recent UP changed the way we look at animated movies, but that doesn't mean the ol' Looney Tunes way is out of fashion. While I did leave a bit underwhelmed, I still say this is what family movies are all about: Tongue-in-cheek fun. If family entertainment is what you're looking for, I recommend that this is the one to see.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",7,5,12,4 July 2009
Signs," 'Signs' of intelligent life in Hollywood.
","My Take: A criminally underrated thriller with some genuinely suspenseful moments and a meditation of faith.For my money, M. Night Shymalan is one of the most misunderstood directors working in Hollywood, if not the one that tops the list. With a body of work which began with the success of THE SIXTH SENSE, Shymalan has made some of the most intriguing films ever to sprout from Hollywood, even if not all of his works are great or perfect in every way. His stories are more than just superior genre entries or just-plain-weird movies, some of them also deal with some sort of personal or religious issue. Although the setup is consistent in every film, each film is always different from the last one; each new movie is something worth waiting for with the thought of how he would pull it off, even if it sort of give us a feeling of uneasiness and uncertainty.The basic premise for SIGNS can be summed up in a few words: Aliens attack a farmhouse. Former preacher widower Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) wakes up one morning to find a large crop circle in his field of corn, stunning both his kids and brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix), especially when strange unseen men run around the fields at night. But SIGNS is more than just an average alien-invasion movie, or a typical sci-fi movie. In fact, SIGNS goes beyond science-fiction and into the realm of fear; it's not about giving off scientific jargon or explanations, it's just about the fear and uncertainty of the unknown. This is probably why many were so disappointed with the films big 'twist' (which, despite a few holes, is not too big a deal). The character of a widower and problematic father has been ventured before, but this isn't the only thing tackled in the movie. There's the relevant use of a past death which affects future events in life. Then there's the question of believing in 'seeing miracles' as opposed to believing that people 'just get lucky', which is the whole point of the much-maligned twist ending. And the way Shymalan builds tension in the situations is something worth noting. How he uses simple everyday tools as in a Baby Monitor, a glass of water and flashlights as means to establish suspense is a triumph. He might have not been the heir of the throne of the great Hitchcock, but he sure learned a lot from him.Whereas Shymalan's other films deal with certain issues, SIGNS is about faith, bending the science-fiction genre into a drama with certain questions about faith. It's not just about questioning the existence of a God, but if He really is out there, are we willing to put our faith in Him in times of perilous situations? But Shymalan discusses these issue in a hushed tone; they never come off too preachy or overbearing. SIGNS is an example of the intriguing, albeit different, storytelling abilities of the underrated Shymalan. It's a slow-burn thriller which will still continue to divide the audience. To some, it may come off as a slow-moving science-fiction thriller. To others, myself included, it's old-fashioned film making and storytelling at its best.Rating: ***** out of 5.",10,0,4,9 January 2010
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," 'Elizabeth' still keeps her throne.
","My Take: Not as bold, dashing or historically accurate as the first ELIZABETH, this sequel still has stunning visuals and superb acting.Stated at the end of the original ELIZABETH are the untold events not portrayed in the film. It is said that Elizabeth I ruled for 40 years, and that those years were also known as the 'Golden Age'. Untold, no longer. For now, there is ELIZABETH: THE GOLDEN AGE, a sequel to a great film that didn't warrant a sequel. Don't get me wrong, ELIZABETH was a great film. A bold, dashing and exhilarating foray into the dark and powerful reign of The Virgin Queen, but its not the kind of film that would require a sequel. It's like expecting a sequel to GONE WITH THE WIND.THE GOLDEN AGE doesn't even do its homework on history. I'm no history buff, but I don't have to be to say that it's highly improbable that Sir Walter Raleigh, even with his strength, defeated the entire Spanish Armada on his own. That's a thing that happens in films like 300 that doesn't give a damn about accuracy. Putting it in a 'serious' historical biography could only be the fault of Hollywood. Other than being inaccurate, the screenplay is often confusing and riddling. Either the script can't stay focused on a single point, or the film lacks the right direction. The films main plot concerns the attempts of Span, led by its unruly King Phillip I (Jordi Mollà), and England's own Virgin Queen (Cate Blanchett, in top form) who regrets to surrender. But the film also revolves around a love triangle between the Queen, a ravishing seafarer Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen) and one of the queens' handmaidens (Abbie Cornish). There's also the plot to overthrow Elizabeth from her thrown by Mary Stuart (Samantha Morton), who proclaims herself the heir to England's throne. Revolving too very often from one plot line after another, it just raises confusion and too many questions.ELIZABETH: THE GOLDEN AGE is a practice in style over substance. Ah, but what style! How much can you put so much style under a single 2-hour feature. Although it has a plot and script intact, the real reason for the film's existence is that Director Shekhar Kapur, costume designer Alexandra Byrne and set production designer Guy Dyas had a field day with the costume designs and sets. The costumes are breathtakingly awesome, bursting with style and certainly puts the 'fab' in fabrics. In fact they are so good, it gets are mind off what the people who wear them are saying. Honestly, we are too busy thinking about how Cate Blanchett wears these outfits each day of filming rather than listening to what the queen is saying. We also marvel at the wondrous sight of incredible set designs that burst with textures and tapestries. The style here is overwhelming, that they even overwhelms the plot.Other than the fabulous designs, the best thing still about the film is the ravishing return of Cate Blanchett for the role that gave her the boost to stardom. Her performance here as the queen is actually tougher and more energetic. When confronted with the Spanish Ambassador, the spunky queen bellows 'I, too, can command the wind sir! I have a hurricane in me that will strip Spain bare when you dare to try me!'. Once again, best best bits of the screenplay goes to Ms. Blanchett, who delivers them with stunning power guaranteed to make a killing at the Oscars. Supporting performances are also fine, especially from Geoffrey Rush returning as the mysterious Sir Francis Walsingham.Overall, it sinks with history and confuses with screenplay, but stuns with sheer beauty, breathtaking style and great performances. It's confusing, riddled, but ravishingly entertaining. Fans of the first film will like what they see, even if it lacks the total control and boldness of its predecessor. For everyone else, its a popcorn-movie which cares less about accuracy but aims to entertain. Set aside the criticism said about this film, and enjoy it for what it is. Sure it's as accurate to history as 300 was (or is that inaccurate), but its fancy and fancifully entertaining.Rating: **** out of 5.",8,1,1,30 April 2008
Beowulf," Turning one of the oldest stories in history to this centuries latest in pure action-adventure.
","My Take: A thrilling summer movie blockbuster. BEOWULF is perhaps the oldest story that Hollywood still takes pride in making. Remember the very memorable battle between Beowulf, the monster Grendel and the monster's mother? And the moral that pride is the curse? Well, its Hollywood's proudest pleasure to give you the new BEOWULF, the new motion-capture animated baby from the father of the craft (or at least the one who uses it the most), Robert Zemeckis. Although BEOWULF still has those emotionless-eyed motion-capture drones and has a big dose of silly dialog, BEOWULF is an ideal model of an action-packed summer movie adventure. Filled with thrilling moments and heart-pounding battles, BEOWULF is an action fans playhouse, and if your home entertainment system's built for the job, this is a real killer on DVD! On the basis of script, however, Zemeckis still hasn't found the perfection. The dialog is made up of the cheesy old-English dialog that's bound the produce a giggle. Although there are real intentional humor in the film, some are still on the verge of camp. The scene where Beowulf fights with the monster evenly by being naked is still hilarious.On the action however, Zemeckis is one heck of a carnival barker. Moments of thrills and excitement are at an abundance. From the moment where Grendel breaks through a feast, entirely shot in darkness, is often chilling. Then of course there's Beowulf battling the monster and even a large dragon in the end (and this is a PG-13). That's pure Hollywood, and that's pure action entertainment.Ask for the actors, we have Ray Winstone as the brave but foolhardy Beowulf (with help from a macho model double), Anthony Hopkins plays the drunken mad Hrothgar, Robin Wright Penn is Wealthhow, Hrothgar's (and later Beowulf's) wife. But Angelina Jolie stills stands out above the rest, baring it all (well, his animation that is) as the monster Grendel's (voiced by Crispin Glover, by the way) mother, vowing vengeance when her monster child was killed (the scene where she emerges all gold, with high heels will just crack you up).The movie's a great example of how a cheesy old sword-and-sorcery flick can become the next best action movie coming out for the summer. It's a lot of fun and I doubt you'll be bored.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",7,0,0,12 May 2008
Speed," Buckle up for safety! SPEED hits the streets
","My Take: A terrific summer movie. Grab on to your seat and buckle up for one heck of a ride. If you don't know how it feels to get 'involved' in a movie's premise, then better rent SPEED and experience it yourself. Living under the shadow of DIE HARD, SPEED elevates the seemingly familiar premise into a virtuoso of action scenes and great pyrotechnics, plentiful enough for three action movies. Not contended with keeping our palms sweaty during a daring rescue in a trapped elevator, the movie turns into a mad dash across the traffic-ridden streets of L.A. during rush hour, and then later, a showdown atop a speeding subway train. If you are not thrilled, at least, by one of these action scenarios, then better go see a doctor just in case your pulse is still running.Instead of ripping-off John McLane from the DIE HARD pictures, which is what a mediocre action knock-off would have done, we are treated with a great action hero. Keanu Reeves is Jack Traven, an LAPD bomb squad officer who, during the first hour, must try to save a couple of people trapped inside an elevator, while a mad (no, eccentric) maniac (played with real villainy by Dennis Hopper) awaits his demand of cash.When that's all said and done, he must now drive a bus above 50 mph to avoid the bomb in the bus from blowing up. See, if the bus drops speed below 50, it blows up big time. It would have been easy if he was driving this bus at night, but this is rush hour, cars and traffic are everywhere. He gets a lot of help from a loyal passenger, played by Sandra Bullock, who truly shines in the role, given that she is given much more to do than your typical damsel. Director (and former cinematographer) Jan DeBont has a field day in his directorial debut, giving the film the touch of class that action classics, like the DIE HARD films, possess. If I may just note: DeBont was also the cinematographer of action greats like DIE HARD and TOTAL RECALL.SPEED is one of those few action thrillers that won't disappoint, as well as those that don't make idiots out of the audience. Sure, some parts of SPEED are questionable to logic, but it moves fast enough (and I mean really fast!) to make you forget them. Another great deal about SPEED is that it doesn't get tired of itself. It knows it can do more, and it delivers. When it's done with one scenario, it proceeds to another, and gives as another new scenario there, and the clichÃ©s are thankfully unused due to the originality of its special effects. But most of all, it has a lot of fun with itself, as the audience has a lot of fun with it.Forget the bloated, uninspired films that claim to be better, a great rental (or better yet, purchase) of SPEED on DVD is twice the treat. Action fans will have so much fun with it as much as non-action fans will love it. SPEED is a clever, thrill-a-minute juggernaut that, simply put, a lot of fun.Rating: ***** out of 5.",10,3,5,22 April 2008
Live Free or Die Hard," Old habits 'Die Hard'.
","My Take: This effects-laden stroll-down-memory-lane is fun, mostly thanks to Willis' return as McLane. 'Why can the same thing happen to the same guy twice?' That's what John McLane asks, and after 12 years, until now John McLane is still having a bad day. Back at the wrong place at the wrong time, Bruce Willis is thrust back to play one of his most beloved characters in LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD (or simply DIE HARD 4.0), a long-delayed sequel to the highly successful DIE HARD franchise. Back as McLane, Willis proves that, even if he lost most of his hair, he hasn't lost the 'Yippee Ki Yay''s and all.So far, the series has been healthy. The first three DIE HARD movies have been successful box-office hits. I liked the first three DIE HARD movies (the first and the second as the best), but does this big-budget effects-driven fourth entry measure up. The answer, it's just about as good as the third film in the series DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE, but I don't think it's as good as the first two. Still, during these days where sequels all but promise a bigger more promising sequels, LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD lives up to its legacy.Back fighting against terrorist in every way, McLane is pitted against a maniacal computer genius named Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant), a surprisingly competent villain who's nearly up there with Alan Rickman's Hans Gruber, who took over the city's power and computer systems, who ransoms for a large amount of money to give it all back. McLane aids help from computer hacker Matt Ferrel (Justin Long) to stop the mastermind and save his daughter (the stunning Mary Elizabeth Winstead) who's been captured, but not without any style, action, stunts and all those yippee Ki Yay's.Since CGI has already taken advantage from many other action films to date, LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD is not about to get left behind. Director Len Wiseman (whose recent resume is the UNDERWORLD films) put in a lot of excessive flashy unbelievable stunts triggered with CGI, much like those stunts in XXX and the Bond film DIE ANOTHER DAY. Due to its use (or more overuse) on special effects, LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD loses the solid impact of its predecessors. The stunts are unbelievable, and t6he CGI makes it look more exciting, but not any more believable.Still, what an impact. It ain't the best in the series, but it's a worthy effort and a terrific successor to the first three pictures. Fans won't be disappointed.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",7,0,1,23 May 2008
X2: X-Men United," Fun to the Xth level. (With DVD details)
","My Take: Better than the original and the best in the series. Bryan Singer's big-budget sequel X2 (X-MEN UNITED) learns from the past to create a better, more streamlined comic book adventure that has a sharper script with just the same wallops of action and special effects. I enjoyed the original X-MEN film, but not for most parts as I should. While it had no further problem with visuals and action, the film is fatally flawed by weak writing. X2 is much better, continuing the legacy started by the first, and offering much more to it as well. The characters, not just Rouge (Anna Paquin), the evil Magneto (Ian McKellen) and Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), are taken into much deeper characteristics. The love-triangle subplot between Wolverine, Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) and Cyclops (James Marsden), which were given much irregular treatment in the original, is given much better treatment here. The characters have so much more to do, and the plot is more complex, even if it isn't even borderline clever.During the great opening sequences (after an elaborate narration about mutants), a mutant poses an attack on the President of the United States, nearly killing him. The ever-benevolent X-men of Professor Xavier's (Patrick Stewart) Mutant Academy believes Magneto could be behind it, but Xavier believes otherwise. Meanwhile, an obsessed scientist (Brian Cox) sees a chance to finally start a war against the mutant race, once he frames them as a threat to mankind. The X-men now must aid help from their own adversary Magneto (McKellen) and his sultry shape-shifting accomplice Mystique (Rebecca Romijn) to prevent a war that could destroy the world... and either race. The mutant gang also get a little help from a new batch of 'gifted' beings including a self-transporting 'Incredible Nightcrawler' (Alan Cumming), freeze-powered Iceman (Shawn Ashmore) and fire-powered Pyro (Aaron Stanford).X2 is not free from its flaws, and while I never really gotten myself in the X-MEN fad, X2 is an agreeably enough thrill-machine on its own. Leave your brain to dry and let the pure 'X' quality flow right through you.Rating: **** out of 5.The DVD: A real treat on the big-screen, X2 will be much of the same delight on DVD. I suggest you get a hold of the 2-disc widescreen edition which features the film in a 2:40:1 Anamorphic widescreen format. The picture is not only clean, it rivals (if not outdoes) the quality featured on the big-screen. The sound is presented in a crisp Dolby Digital sound that's bound to blow you away, and don't you think it's safe to turn it down a little. If you're interested in the film's backstage drama, the DVD has a basket-load of special features, including an Audio-commentary with the director (Singer), cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel, and another with the writers and producers. Disc 2 offers more, including a a making-of documentary called 'The Second Uncanny Issue of X-Men', as well as a series of informative featurettes and Multi-angle screen study of the famous Nightcrawler Attack prologue. Included as well, is an in-depth look on fight scene rehearsals. Finally, there's 11 deleted scenes and theatrical trailers.

The Sixth Sense," One of the most poignantly-told ghost stories of all time.
","My Take: Nuanced and subtly creepy, and oftentimes heartbreaking and sad. A perfect showcase of M. Night Shymalan's unique storytelling talents.Haters call M. Night Shymalan the 'one-hit wonder' so aggressively that they seem to forget just how effective that 'one-hit' was. His first real big hit (but not his first film), THE SIXTH SENSE is a perfect introduction to the unique and rarely seen (in Hollywood)) storytelling talents of M. Night Shymalan, something that wasn't appreciated for too long. But I doubt anyone will disagree that THE SIXTH SENSE is a triumph of storytelling; a ghost story told in a most original and subtle way and achieves to sustain our interest without much use of heavy effects. But it's actually more than just another well-crafted ghost story, It's also actually an interesting drama grounded in semi-supernatural elements. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) is a gifted psychologist; his friends and his wife (Olivia Williams) thinks his talents is a gift, but he on the other hand considers it a curse due to a failure to cure a kid in the past that since has haunted him. Meanwhile, Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment, a career-making performance) is a quiet, problematic boy. He gets picked on by his bully classmates and his mom (Toni Collette) isn't exactly comfortable when he isn't telling her what's wrong. And you thought seeing dead people was tough! The film says ghost see only what they want to see. So that doesn't make them any less different from the living. Here, Cole sees his ability to see and communicate with folks from the other side as a curse; something he wished he never had. But when he discovers how to wrest control of it, he starts to see what it really is: A gift in disguise. This plays a very strong part with the film's still shocking ending (a gimmick Shymalan would use in his later films), but actually plays (among with other issues) throughout the films. THE SIXTH SENSE is more than just a well-crafted genre picture; Shymalan uses it as means to tell a story dealing with some personal issues.Most will remember THE SIXTH SENSE as for its shocker of an ending, a great example of a true and shocking payoff that provides the perfect closure to a perfect film. But the pleasures of THE SIXTH SENSE doesn't begin and end there. The relevant issues tackled throughout the film (more prominently, family issues like divorce, mid-life crises and rejection) is unnerving just as some of the film's 'jump-from-your-seat' moments are subtly creepy. But among the things that truly grabbed me about THE SIXTH SENSE is it's true emotions. Haters can call Shyamalan whatever they want, but he knows a thing or two about emotions. The scene where Cole talks to his mom about how he gets frequent 'visits' from grandma starts out creepy, but really is sad and heartfelt, and Shymalan doesn't make use of any faux emotions whatsoever; just the simplicity of the staging of the scene. Then there's the ending (which I will not reveal for the sake of the small number of people who have not seen it or don't remember it), which was intended to shock the audience. But come to look at it, I realized just how sad and heartbreaking it really is.The setup for his later films would be similar to THE SIXTH SENSE, from the nuanced slow-burn setup paid off by a shocker ending. But like THE SIXTH SENSE, Shymalan's later films have an interesting story told in a most unique way not seen in most typical Hollywood movies. There's always something to look forward to in his films. Ever since his success with THE SIXTH SENSE, we are introduced to an unqualified talented storyteller; often hated but nevertheless one of the most underrated minds in Hollywood today.Rating: ***** out of 5.",10,0,2,22 January 2010
Final Destination," A terrific scare show.
","My Take: One of the spookier and more creative horror movies today. In watching a horror flick, there are two things that I would expect. Either it's a true scare ride that makes me want to run for cover or shows true moments of uniqueness for its genre that it is scary. Both pleasure are in the slasher flick FINAL DESTINATION, which is surprisingly more creative and stylishly spooky than other 'hack-and-slash' horror/slasher yarns. Although the characters are the usual teenagers served up for slaughter, they do a very terrific job in setting us up for a scare, and doesn't disappoint when it comes to their delivery.Devon Sawa's character is named Alex, who has some strange premonitions of doom when boarding a plane to France. When on board, Alex had a realistic daydream of doom and began yelling out 'This plane will explode at take-off.' This part gets a little wild. Hold on! It gets real serious when the plane DOES explode. His fellow French class members and school teacher manages to get out before the plane exploded, but are now, death has a new 'design' for them. Obviously, death doesn't take no for an answer.Perhaps the best things and most likely the biggest reason viewers (especially horror buffs and teenagers) to watch FINAL DESTINATION are the really good quality kills. I mean, if you want to get rid of that teenager, who knows that their doom is at hand, why not do it with some style? This film has some very creative death sequences which might be one of the best I've seen in a horror film since the ones in THE OMEN series. Sure the possibility of that happening to you can only happen in a move, but this is a movie, right? Cinematic, indeed, but very, very creative.Sure it features teenage characters that are not given any personality, but in this kind of film, which is just made to kill off the teenagers quick (and good), I don't think it needs time to develop its characters. The film isn't good on the cerebral basis (in other words, it's sometimes isn't smart), but the storyline has some very neat ideas (like the death sequences) and director James Wong does a great job making it to a wild ride. I was so surprised how I liked this film (both as a stylish or a 'run for cover' horror flick). FINAL DESTINATION is a terrific scare show.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",7,0,2,18 October 2007
Rear Window," 'You asked for something dramatically different. You got it.'
","My Take: A Hitchcock suspense classic; the master at his best.While VERTIGO still tops my list as my favorite Hitchcock movie, many will argue that his 1954 classic REAR WINDOW is his best movie. With a the master trademark 'bomb-under-the-breakfast-table' suspense, matched with a perfect mix of romance and deft bits of humor, it's not hard to see why many of Hitch's fans regard this as the definitive Hitchcock movie.Still one of the best of Hitchcock collaborators (and still one of my favorite actors), James Stewart plays J.B. 'Jeff' Jeffries, an adventurous photographer who is stuck in his apartment while waiting for his broken leg to recover. To pass the time, Jeff watches his neighbors in the adjoined apartment buildings, watching their everyday dramas and goings-on. Perhaps one of the best qualities about the movie is Hitch and screenwriter John Michael Hayes introducing us to a series of quirky everyday characters like Ms. Torso (Georgine Darcy), a sexy partying ballerina; Ms. Lonelyhearts (Judith Evelyn), a heartbroken single woman; a frustrated songwriter (Ross Bagdasarian) whose a little lost with words; and a newlywed couple who confines their private dramas in a closed window (I think there's as much mystery behind those blinds as there is in the whole movie). Then there's Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr), a traveling salesman living with his nagging sick wife. That is until he starts leaving his apartment every night, and his wife is nowhere in sight.Stewart doesn't take sole credit; the glamorous Grace Kelly gives an excellent supporting performance as Jeff's up-class girlfriend Lisa who shares his enthusiasm with Thorwald's strange activities. Burr is subtly effective as the mysterious Thorwald (who doesn't utter a single line up until the climax) and Thelma Ritter is witty as Jeff's no-nonsense nurse. Even the background characters are excellent! It's a little slow-going, especially during the first half where several main and background characters are introduced, and the plot has been ripped-off and imitated several times that it has since become a cliché. Not that it matters. So it proves in the test of time, Hitchcock's original is still a classic and he's still head and shoulders above the rest.Rating: ***** out of 5.",10,0,1,16 October 2009
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The phrase 'Save the best for last' has never been so evident.
","My Take: The best of the best. An unforgettable grand-scale epic. 'This is it', director Peter Jackson might have said. 'This is the film where the name Peter Jackson will be remembered for.' Indeed, it is. The phrase 'Save the best for last' has never been so evident. And not since THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK have we had a sequel that outdoes an original that is too powerful to defeat. THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE RETURN OF THE KING is a sequel the third movie in the series of adaptations of J.R.R. Tolkien's bestselling novels including THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING and THE TWO TOWERS, two very strong box-office hits that aren't easily topped from the highest spot. But, surprisingly, it was (by this film, no less). But still, all three films act like one big epic of a movie that's just plain beautiful, exciting and enjoyable to watch.The film continues the events where THE TWO TOWERS left off, having not much separate characters to focus on. This time, it only have the escapades of Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood, companion Sam Gamgee (Sean Astin) and the treacherous Gollum/Smeagol (voiced by Andy Serkis) on their quest for the gates of Mordor and continue their mission to destroy the One Ring. On the other end, we have Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) and the people of Rohan fighting for glory against the forces of Mordor who has besieged the capital city of Gondor, ruled by a treacherous ruler (John Noble), a typical stereotype of a cowardly ruler.Director (Jackson) doesn't disappoint the fans he has earned with the series he created. Of course he shows new special-effects advancements in the brilliant battle sequences, lots of creative creatures and outlandish settings, but he also keeps a strong direction, brilliant performances from the cast and other stylish works behind the camera. Films like this come ones in a full moon, but Jackson does such a great job, he succeeds to make such a rare and min-blowing achievement.Here I am, brainstorming one of the best films of the last few years and I'll make sure that the LOTR series is there, with THE RETURN OF THE KING on the top spot of the entire series.Rating: ***** out of 5.",10,2,5,11 October 2007
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," STAR WARS: It's become more than just a movie, it's now an experience.
","My Take: Need i say more? It's STAR WARS! I have never seen STAR WARS in theaters, so you may not here anything in this review about those days were people flocked to theaters like an angry mob just to get a seat in nearly-full rows. Neither will you here about the lines that flocked back when series creator/director George Lucas brought back STAR WARS for a second round (now featuring never-before-seen footage, mostly with new special effects). My experiences with STAR WARS usually was on home video, and now the all new DVD's, where Lucas evidently has fallen in love with his work a bit too much. But even if he did a few revamps and revisits, STAR WARS is the kind of film that actually holds up for quite a time.Mostly memorable are, of course, the special effects, were it's meaning might have probably been changed by the release of this film. While special effects have been used already before STAR WARS was released, the film still showed it's audiences something anyone has never seen before, or not in the way it was featured in STAR WARS. With STAR WARS, Mr. Lucas has enabled to share his childlike visions and imaginations, which then gave way to other directors, lining up in Lucas powerhouse ILM effects studios with their bag of ideas. The incredible sights in STAR WARS aren't just the best thing from those faithful days in 1977, it has now become a history of the word special effects, or perhaps of its new meaning in movies.But STAR WARS isn't just memorable for the majesty of their mind-defying special effects, STAR WARS also works because of its inspiration on characters and storyline. The characters, starting from young farm boy-turned hero Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), stubborn but cocky gangster Han Solo (Harrison Ford), spontaneous Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), wise master warrior Ben Kenobi (Alec Guiness), merciless evil villain Darth Vader (Dave Prowse, voiced by James Earl Jones) as well as the lovable droid duo C3PO (Anthony Daniels) and R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) and many others are either caricatures of our dreams characters as a kid or inspired from famous characters in other adventure films, mostly Akira Kurosawa's THE HIDDEN FORTRESS and SEVEN SAMURAI. But Lucas makes these inspired characters with originality, and most importantly, likability. These are a bunch of characters that aren't too deep, but are beloved and charming, we don't need to know more about them than the fact that they are the most reliable characters in a classic sci-fi epic.Throw in the creativity punched into the special-effects, starting from the gangster-era inspired wastelands of the planet Tatooine, punctuated with a samurai-inspired lightsaber duel and ending with the exciting WWII-inspired space dogfight, STAR WARS is a feast for the imagination that hasn't just become the ultimate screen comic book adventure, it's an experience that didn't just change the meaning of the word 'special effects', but also the word 'blockbuster'.Rating: ***** out of 5.",10,2,4,4 February 2008
300," It's a big-budget, violent and sometimes silly epic, which works as a blood-drugged eye candy.
","My take: A triumph in visual style over substance. Historical epics have been taken seriously with latest blockbuster hits like TROY and KINGDOM OF HEAVEN. It's just about time that Hollywood make their own material out of it. Thus, 300 is born. Matched with Frank Miller's gut-wrenching dark epic and Zack Snyder's violent touches, 300 is exactly as what pop-entertainment is when combined with history. The movie is too silly to be a film to watch during history class, yet, watching it as a pop-entertainment flick, it works in its own ways. It's a big-budget, violent and sometimes silly epic, which works as a blood-drugged eye candy.The film is supposed to portray the events involving the Spartans, lead by King Leonidas (played by Gerald Butler), against the invading Persians. But, the film has a lot of over-the-top action sequences and bizarre creatures, I doubt that this i very far from what actually happened. But still, Hollywood tends to do a lot of alternations, even when it comes to reality. The film is simply fantasy, which is a good thing, because many epic movie viewers are crazy for this kind of films because we are introduced to a lot of elaborate battles, strange creatures, vivid-named (and described) characters and many other things.300 offers all those things. Even if I found some of the battle sequences ridiculous, they are still very interesting to watch simply as 'Oh! It only happens in the movies' kind of fun. The characters aren't much exercised, but the performances by the actors playing these characters are pretty good. The best thing, though, and probably the most interesting thing about this film is its resemblance to the graphic novels by Frank Miller. Indeed, it's over-the-top (perhaps way too), but this is exactly how it was envisioned in Miller's story, and Snyder, a specialist of this thing (after making the remake of DAWN OF THE DEAD), does it terrifically, giving it also an excellent video game-like experience.It may be far from being the best film of its year, but it was definitely a good one. A big-budget epic that knows exactly what to give the audience.Rating: *** out of 5.",6,0,0,18 October 2007
Apollo 13," A Successful Failure.
","My Take: Desite a few sizable flaws, APOLLO 13 is a great romp. Ron Howard's riveting and dramatic APOLLO 13, a terrific recreation of the famous events NASA near-failure, should be the answer to all those questions thrown in by those too young or too old to remember that fateful day when NASA's 'routine' flight to the moon turns into the most memorably tragic one in their careers. Adapting from the novel 'Lost Moon' by Jim Lovell and Jeffrey Kluger, screenwriter William Broyles Jr. and Al Reinert has written a riveting and gripping screenplay toying with the techno-jargon and human drama of the fateful days of the monumental disaster, while Howard stuck to the facts. From using the real newsreel footage covering the entire event to realistic images of space, Howard has created a perfect realization that captures the tension and especially the drama.As for the casting, nothing could be more flawless with the casting of Tom Hanks as astronaut Jim Lovell (by the way, the real Jim Lovell actually makes a cameo somewhere in the film) who dreams of the stars and sees the chance to reach it when he is tasked to be one of the astronauts manning the Apollo 13 mission. Bill Paxton plays Fred Haise while Kevin Bacon plays Jack Swigert, the last minute replacement of Ken Mattingly (Gary Sinise), believed to have drug complications. Kathleen Quinlan, however, provides what may be the film's more challenging performance as Lovell's wife Barbara, who experiences the dread, fear and drama back on earth as his husband and two of his companions are trapped inside the bowels of the crippled ship Odyssey, slowly running out of fuel and oxygen, aiding the help of Mission Control, led by Gene Kranz (Ed Harris), back at NASA.The pacing is a little slow during the first hour, but everything picks up real quickly as Howard jump-starts the tragic events. While we are already familiar about the splashdown ending, Howard and screenplay keeps audiences' palms sweaty with suspense and tension. This is because the characters are so involving, we let ourselves carried away by them, and what happens to them. From the endless commotion going on inside The Odyssey to the drama back on earth with Lovell's wife and family, APOLLO 13 keeps us right up there with them, from lift-off to splashdown.Excellent cinematography by Dean Cundey and an excellent score by James Horner are just among the final touches that make APOLLO 13 the best in pure 'you were there' entertainment.Rating: ***** out of 5.",10,1,1,2 August 2008
Fantastic Four," Three's a crowd, 'Four's a bore.
","My Take: Lives and breathes in special effects. It only ends up silly and tiresomely forgettable. Like all summer movie throwaways, it's best if you don't expect anything brilliant in FANTASTIC FOUR, a big-screen romp of the famous Marvel creations by Stan Lee. It is what it is, a big-budget comic book of a movie, complete with busy special effects and... well special effects. I wasn't expecting Shakespeare, but even so, FANTASTIC FOUR is a style-over-substance action picture. A big dumb summer movie that does its job, but that ain't worth remembering for. Once the credits rolled, there's hardly anything to remember in this lively but predictably forgettable summer movie of the generic order.The characters are, unlike those in other superhero movies like BATMAN and SUPERMAN, have no back story other than they are superheroes. Hence, these 'supers' aren't interesting to the least. They're just a bunch of special effects creations with no heart, or even soul. Even if they are played by real actors like Ioan Gruffud (Mr. Fantastic), Jessica Alba (The Invisible Woman), Michael Chiklis (The Thing) and Chris Evans (The Human Torch, the most annoying of the batch), they never really shine as humans and more of special effects creations.Firstly, they hardly have an origin. Sure, it is briefly explained that they were victims of an unknown space cloud, but then what? When they become super, they save a couple of people, but not enough to outnumber how many times they act like a couple of celebrities at Tinsel Town. A real superhero wouldn't do that. No, a real superhero is very secure about his personalities. These guys don't seem to have some either. When I'm in a middle of a crisis, I'd like a hero that doesn't come with paparazzi.Besides the special effects which were actually good, everything else is bad. The acting is mediocre, with Alba being the weakest and Evans being the most annoying (could you get a more annoying superhero?). The script baffles the worst lines of that summer (what do you expect from this thing?). If special effects will make your time, FANTASTIC FOUR might too. If you ask me, I forgot most of it until I saw it again. This ain't the kind of movie I'd watch more than once or twice.Rating: ** out of 5.",4,0,2,15 May 2008
Click," Happy Gilmore... with his universal remote.
","My Take: Derivative yet funny. Almost all of Adam Sandler comedies sum up similarly. HAPPY GILMORE, THE WATERBOY, THE LONGEST YARD, and now, CLICK. CLICK isn't any different from other of Sandler's movies, but it's perhaps the most relevant and, perhaps, the smartest, even if it isn't the least brilliant. It's pure Sandler formula, but it works well with a better script, derived from IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE and BRUCE ALMIGHTY, and its mildly amusing with a touch.I hardly bought Sandler as a father in his movies (BIG DADDY mainly), but he did better this time around. He plays Michael Newman, a workaholic who chooses work, aiming to be his boss's new partner, over spending time with his family, much to the disappointment of his wife (Kate Beckinsale) and kids. When life gets too tough for him, or basically getting a difficult time to turn on the television, he decides to buy a universal remote to 'make his life less complicated'. Christopher Walken plays the eccentric 'store clerk' named Morty who gives him a Universal Remote Control ('the remote that controls your universe.'), who also pops up unexpectedly to give him advices on how to use it. This gives Michael, of course, the opportunity to do things he'd been dying to do. This includes messing with his boss (David Hasselhoff) who refuses to promote him, shutting up his wife's nagging best friend , and mess with the little annoying kid next door. All this is quite funny and they deliver, even if some jokes are mean-spirited and some, fall short off the mark.Although it doesn't always work, CLICK delivers the promise. It's quite funny enough, especially during the scenes with Sandler and Walken. When both of these guys are on the screen, the comedy sparks fly. Sandler's acting hasn't yet improved over the years and the morality is simply spoiled by the fact that Michael has been to mean all his life, but I didn't mind, it delivers exactly what I wanted.CLICK is far from its inspirations (said above), but all in all, its worth the effort. I had fun enough to give it a ***1/2.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",7,0,1,15 April 2008
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The very best STAR WARS there is.
","My Take: Bigger and surprisingly deeper, this visual fest still stands as the finest offering under the label of STAR WARS. The first 'Star Wars' is, like what Shakespeare would say, such a palpable hit, that making a sequel will indeed be a big challenge, even for a man who has it all, George Lucas. Yet, Lucas succeeded. 'Empire Strikes Back' is better than the first film, and that's a great achievement enough. Making a sequel to one of the hardest things, perhaps, even to the most prolific or talented of directors. 'Empire Strikes Back' rivals and precedes it's predecessor by throwing in a lot of visuals. But stunning visuals that outdo everything in the original isn't just what the public demands. By the time EMPIRE STRIKES BACK hit screens, STAR WARS has already caught with the public. Everyone knows who these characters are. Now, all that's left there is to know who they really are. If STAR WARS is the introduction, EMPIRE is what George Lucas must have really had in mind. Lucas was wise to pass the directorial reigns to Irvin Kershner, a director who knows how to direct, and use his imagination thru filming. I've seen Kershner's other films, and I must say, they're all evident in 'Empire'. The plot this time centers more deeply on an every-growing political conflict. The Republic forces, hiding from a temporarily retreating Galactic Empire, are planning there next attempt on the Imperial forces. Led of course by Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), the forces are settling on a secret base on an uncharted planet. The evil Darth Vader (Dave Prowse, voiced by James Earl Jones) bares a grudge on young Skywalker (after events in the first film), and vows vengeance. After a sudden attack by Imperial Forces at the Rebel base (a visual-effects spectacle), young Luke must follow his very destiny. Now, this is where the real events in the 'Star Wars' series really turns. At this point, Lucas has earned his place in Hollywood for his terrific storytelling talents.I wouldn't dream to tell the entire story, for I'm not that kind of film reviewer. But I'm pretty sure, you've seen this by now. Be that any version, you definitely have. Lucas has issued enough DVD or video versions of this film to make you see it. Remembering watching 'The Empire Strikes Back' and the other 'Star Wars' films when I was a kid is a key to actually enjoying them now. These kind of films are just plain terrific spectacles. One, that Hollywood movies today should be. Pure spectacle in special-effects and visuals and also in plot and story. How many blockbusters are still made this way? THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is probably the best STAR WARS there is. Riveting, exciting, fun but what deeply surprises is the depth and storytelling. Wherever George Lucas may have gone nowadays, we always have EMPIRE to remind us how he, or anyone, used to make 'em. Rating: ***** out of 5.",10,0,1,23 September 2007
Aladdin," Wish granted!
","My Take: The sort of cinematic magic Disney has come to offer. After spawning success with their LITTLE MERMAID, the studio's latest work in many years, Disney proceeded with ALADDIN, which comprises another witty and enjoyable charm drawn from colorful animation, enjoyable characters, swift bits of action and solid bits of comedy. Some of the humor falls flat (lets face it, when the humor doesn't come from Robin Williams' Genie or Gilbert Gottfried as the noisy wisecracking parrot, the humor falls a little flat), but everything else fits so perfectly, and it all clearly shows what kind of success Disney spawns.The first half, where Aladdin (voiced by Scoot Weinger) and his life as a 'worthless street-rat', falters a bit at times, but it practically catches up in the second half, mostly from the introduction of Williams' manic Genie, who not only fits Williams, but also fits his personalities and manic humor, mostly including nods to Williams' comic impersonations of stars, from Robert DeNiro to Jack Nicholson. If just for Williams, ALADDIN is a true delight for the adult audience. But Williams isn't just the only delight in ALADDIN. Characters of various colors and musical numbers of sheer delight all come together to create a true family movie delight.Directors John Musker and Ron Clements (the magicians behind MERMAID) has brought together this enjoyable affair, complete with appealing characters that would act as a trademark for future Disney enterprises. From a straightforward lead of Aladdin and Princess Jasmine (voiced by Linda Larkin) to the nifty effective villainy of Jaffar (voiced superbly by Jonathan Freeman) and his meddling parrot companion (voiced by Gilbert Gottfried), the film gives us characters we can root for, and characters to be delighted from, good or bad guy. The animation is a true delight, ranging from an active foreground to an elaborate background, ALADDIN delights with sheer colorful brilliance. This is Disney at top form, and what instant classics are made of! Sit back, and enjoy this magic carpet-ride into a wonderful enterprise best be described in three simple words: Shining, shimmering splendid.Rating: ***** out of 5.",10,1,1,20 June 2008
Saboteur," Typical Hitchcock, but in top form.
","SABOTEUR looks like a prototype of Alfred Hitchcock's later film NORTH BY NORTHWEST (it's also similar to his earlier classic THE 39 STEPS). Everything from the man framed for a crime he didn't commit, the lovely young woman who helps him out, and the climactic final confrontation in some famous landmark. Substitute Cary Grant's Roger Thornhill to Robert Cummings' Barry Kane, Eva Marie Saint's Eve Kendall to Priscilla Lane's Pat Martin and the finale take place atop the Statue of Liberty instead of Mt. Rushmore and you have SABOTEUR.Still, although it isn't the best movie the Master of Suspense has created, it's nonetheless watchable and rather entertaining. The pace moves rather fast early on where factory worker Barry Kane (Cummings) is framed for setting the factory on fire. Kane knows who really did it and hopes to clear his name. As usual, he narrowly escapes the law and several occasions in hopes that he find the real saboteur before he strikes again. But since this is way before Hitchcock's bigger budget productions, SABOTEUR is a little tamer than his later works. The cast is OK at best, with Cummings coming of as a decent man-on-the-run but a rather wooden actor. Lane's performance fares a little better, but she's not the best of the later perennial blond heroines. Only Otto Kruger's and Norman Lloyd's suitable intriguing antagonists that remain the best.The pace slows down midway (involving a scene inside a train with a bunch of circus freaks feels a bit out of place in a Hitchcock movie), but picks up later on, especially before the climax atop the Statue of Liberty (which, sad to say, is rather anti-climatic). Overall, not one of Hitchcock's best movies and far outdone by later attempts at the 'man-on-the-run' formula, but a must-see for Hitchcock's fans.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",7,0,2,12 May 2010
Happy Feet," A beautifully charming, yet also surprisingly smart animated entertainment.
","My Take: Stunning animation and terrific musical numbers worthy of Gene Wilder make for a great time at the movies. After MARCH OF THE PENGUINS, a movie/documentary about real-life penguins and their Antarctic perilous journeys, which was released just previously, audiences might have already seen enough penguins, even just for this year. But another penguin fairytale is just at hand, with its trailer already out at the time. HAPPY FEET, by the looks of the trailer, may just be a corny animated movie which relies heavily on the cutesy than a proper story and more elaborate creativity. I missed HAPPY FEET on the big-screen, but I was sound surrounded by the fact that it was a hit. Of course, the appeal of famous actors like Nicole Kidman, Hugh Jackman, Elijah Wood, Brittany Murphy and a soundtrack of famous pop songs (old and new) performed by the best of computer-animated penguins. If you think as much I did back then, well wrong are we.I didn't think I was going to hate HAPPY FEET back then, but I didn't expect much from it. But, when I finally saw, the surprise was sudden. Armed with the usually reused charms of talking animals, HAPPY FEET takes some of the things much further, turning it into an actually clever musical adventure, where there are a lot of singing, dancing, but doesn't lack the importance of good characters and a somewhat charming storyline. Sure, the story gets quite corny and silly, sure too much of the singing and dancing will get some of the viewers bogged down. But the penguins never get boring. In fact, viewers might find themselves forgetting that the characters are penguins, due to their much diverse personalities that almost makes them human. Pity on the humans of course, since most of them are reduced to blue-eyed, motion capture drones, but no matter, HAPPY FEET has a place for them just as well.The success of its genius come from the fact that, on the helm, is director George Miller who, as you might remember produced the highly-acclaimed talking animal movie BABE then directed the sequel called BABE: PIG IN THE CITY, which were the smartest in this somewhat popular sub-genre. Miller, unlike some others who might get the job, gives his 'kid's movie' characters with much maturity, giving them more appeal to the old as much to the young. Although the preachy message might have been more improved, there couldn't be much more of a thing to be done with it, so let's leave well enough alone. The voice actors all do well, blending in with their characters and do quite well with a specially hilarious and yet cohesive script.Does HAPPY FEET change to world, as it might have been described in the movie? Definitely not. But it doesn't have to. It does what it was intended to do, and transforms it into a more remarkable result. For its success (and its penguins), I'm grading this 'happy feat' a *****.Rating: ***** out of 5.",10,2,2,8 February 2008
Slumdog Millionaire," Sure feels like a million rupees!
","My Take: The Best Picture winner of 2008 an enjoyable and uniquely-told rags-to-riches story. Saying anything, good or bad, about Danny Boyle's SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE won't be nothing more than a preaching with the crowd, not that it would affect the film's reputation. With an overwhelming response to its viewers, SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE has since become almost critic-proof upon its release. It was a critic and awards darling which eventually swept most of the awards it was nominated for. It was indeed a success, which is much to say for a movie that's simply about a story of an underdog winning 20 million rupees.So what makes SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE such a great movie? Is it the masses' hankering to see a simple rags-to-riches story? Is it the eventual word of mouth that spread afterward? And if it was that last one, what would have made such a word of mouth even spread? Well in my opinion, the strength of SLUMDOG might have not just been on the story, but more on the telling. The story of SLUMDOG has already become something common: It's about Jamal (Dev Patel), an 18-year old teen who has lived on the streets of Mumbai all his life. But when he enters the Mumbai version of 'Who Wants to Be A Millionaire', without having a formal education. Did he cheat? Probably. That's why before the winning last question, he is kidnapped by guys who want him to confess. Is he a genius? Probably, but he does need help from the audience when asked about the meaning of emblem of India. Or perhaps, is it destiny that's driving him to the finish line? The story could probably be anyone's underdog story, and yet on the screen, it isn't. The film sports an indie-film look, where the cinematography, lighting and even music accurately captures a Bollywood film. There's even a lively dance sequence during the finale. You swear Boyle has done this sort of thing before! The soundtrack is wonderful too. But sporting style over substance would be nothing to the audience if it doesn't really do much for the story. SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE may have added style to its story, but in the end its the story that rings true. Audiences could easily involve themselves with the characters and their plights. In telling the story, Boyle has not just made it visually stunning and inviting, he has made it effective and effectively entertaining.Rating: ***** out of 5.",10,0,1,21 December 2009
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," 'You call this archeology?'
","My Take: A lighter approach than the ominous TEMPLE OF DOOM, this highly enjoyable romp is a highly entertaining adventure.Sequels don't usually live through this long, but the INDIANA JONES series has, and even at the third chapter, the fun with the whip-wielding archaeologist has not run out. In INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE, we don't only get Indiana Jones (still played with perfection by Harrison Ford), but we also get to meet his father, the brilliant Dr. Henry Jones Sr. (Sean Connery, a perfect match). Ford and Connery has such a chemistry in the film, and it is perhaps the best thing about it. Seeing Indy getting a little help from dad (who, may I just remind, is played by an actor who used to play James Bond 007 himself) makes such a surprising entertainment for a third chapter in a series that practically borrows the formula used in the first two films.Much like the first film RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, Indy goes up against power-hungry Nazis once more, who this time is in search of the fabled Holy Grail, the cup in which Jesus served with during the Last Supper. Other than his father, Indy also gets help from old buddies Proffesor Brody (Denholm Elliot) and Sallah (John Rhys-Davies). They race against time trying to make sure they find the grail before the Nazis do. Allison Doody plays Dr. Elsa Schneider, a historian who may not be who she seems, and Julian Glover plays Walter Donovan.The formula is mainly a rehash of the first film, as it basically pits Indy against Nazis once more. Other than the opening scenes, which features a young Indiana Jones (River Phoenix) in his very first adventure, the film is reworking the plot of the first film, with some several differences. Still, if it weren't the original formula, we wouldn't have loved it as much as we do. The INDIANA JONES series, much like the Bond series, follows a certain formula of its own. We, by now, know exactly how it goes, but thanks to some creativity that fortunately Hollywood producers still have, the movie is fun, and it's not deja 'vu all over again. The movie has a lot of fun with special effects, stunt sequences, but not without providing quality to the characters and edge to the plot.Sequels aren't supposed to be this good. It seemed to have become a rule that sequels aren't meant to be better than the original. INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE has not broken the rule, but even so, this is a very worthy sequel. An original film on its own.Rating: ***** out of 5.",10,0,1,21 May 2008
Back to the Future," Time hasn't aged it.
","My Take: A modern classic sci-fi comedy.Still stands out as one of the most creative and funny comedies of all time, as well as a creative piece of science fiction, BACK TO THE FUTURE is fun, funny as well as fast-paced and very entertaining. Greatly contributing from a clever screenplay and playful yet professional handling by director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg, BACK TO THE FUTURE is a classic of its kind, and I think it's also one of a kind.The special effects have surely dated a bit, considering that the pattern for effects have advanced through the years. But they're still a lot of elaborate fun. Besides, perhaps the real 'special effect' of the film is the clever screenplay. Written by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale, the script has dozens of very clever and ingenious ideas. The entire concept explanation of time travel remains original and brilliant until now, even providing some inspiration for other time-travel films 'ala BLAST FROM THE PAST.Michael J. Fox plays the teenage Marty McFly, who is accidentally whisked back in the year 1955 when he hops aboard a time-traveling Delorean created by the near-mad Dr. E. Brown, or simply Doc (played hilariously by Christopher Lloyd). Once there, he gets into trouble with his would-be parents, still teenagers, when her would-be mother (Lea Thompson) falls in love with him, instead of his would-be father (Crispin Glover), which sets the film's hilarious comedy with a difference.Despite some occasionally bad language, BACK TO THE FUTURE is perfect family entertainment, and I think it still is. It's fun and original, something that most recent, more expensive blockbusters can't do at the same time. And unlike most films that it could have been, BACK TO THE FUTURE doesn't get bogged down to a pure special effects exhibition. The film has a lot of fun with its actors and script, and values them as much as any million dollar effects thrown in. For those, very few, who haven't seen it, don't afford to miss it!

Shark Tale," Something was very fishy about 'Shark Tale'.
","My Take: Colorful yet under-written animated movie. Despite 'Shark Tale' being a rather comical and colorful animation serial by Dreamworks Studios, this film somehow marks the beginning of the end for the studios big success, starting with such delights like the two 'Shrek' films. 'Shark Tale' started to loose its charm as time passes, something that any change to DVD can't cover for. This movie is rather unfunny compared to the likes of the first 'Shrek', and most especially the superior sequel 'Shrek 2'. The film follows the success of Pixar's 'Finding Nemo', but is sorely left behind by how much 'Nemo' succeeded. How could it? Because this one tried to be cool and serious at the same time in one movie. They wanted to give its viewer both a fast-tongued comedy spoof and a 'Godfather' of the animated kind. But some success are too big for all to come true.Now, enough of negatives. 'Shark Tale' does offer some entertainment. The voicing may get pretty annoying at times, but Robert DeNiro's voice as Don Lino, the shark mob boss is very good. Admittedly, it's fun to see DeNiro going tough and bad as a shark. The animation is colorful and clear, may you see it on either the big-screen or DVD. And some of the laughs does work sometimes, when seen in the right mood.Overall, not a success, but not much of a disappointment. If only it targeted more on a frequent audience and had a more kid-friendly plot to accompany the fine colors.Rating: *** out of 5.",6,1,3,25 May 2007
The Birds," A murder most 'fowl'
","My Take: Brilliant, subtle and surprisingly sophisticated. Although age has certainly taken advantage on Alfred Hitchcock's 1963 thriller THE BIRDS, it's still one of the few of these 'nature goes wild' thrillers that manage to keep its momentum and some of its effectiveness. Although the plot of nature turning against mankind seemed dated and became the subject of B-grade drive -in flicks and William Girdler's camping trip horrors, THE BIRDS does keep its credibility as a thriller, and a clever and subtle one at that. The silence and subtleness of the film, featuring the fact that it doesn't have an original score, presents The Master of Suspense's clever ways of obtaining suspense. There are a lot of scenes here that provide some tingle and chills, rather than violence and gore, which is somehow more effective. And, surprisingly, Hitch doesn't spare providing some bits of old-fashioned humor and romance. Hitchcock may be one of the few talents in Hollywood that can successfully fuse low-key comedy and offbeat romance with fear and panic.The first few half of the film (The first attack doesn't occur until later on) was more of a comedy and a mismatched relationship between characters. Mainly, it is about the human characters first, including spoiled city girl Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren's Debut), who flirts with lawyer Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor). Hitchcock continues on with the humorous tone when Melanie does follow Mitch in his summer house in Bodega Bay, with a present of lovebirds intended for Mitch's sister (Veronica Cartwright). Serious thing picks up when poor Melanie gets attacked by a gull, which is later followed by a series of bizarre attacks from the birds on Bodega Bay residence. What caused them to turn against mankind? Is Melanie involved? Is she EVIL? Not even Hitch or the climax will leave you the answer to that.This, I think, is a very underrated work from The Master of Suspense, with much of the complaints coming from the film ending short of what was expected. But I may be only the few ones who actually understand what Hitch is trying to do here. I think the ending may not explain the endless 'whats?' and 'hows', but satisfaction has nothing to do with it. Hitchcock is not the kind of director who would wanted the film to end with a bang. Hitch wanted to give as the film that would give us the creeps, and successfully gives us one that we'd think about even after it's over.Yes, I give it *****. Although it isn't usually compared with Hitch's other efforts like PSYCHO, REAR WINDOW and VERTIGO, THE BIRDS, without the comparisons, is still a great thriller that manages to create a very competent material in a premise that hardly anyone would believe in. Alongside the said classics, THE BIRDS still remains one of the master's best and most interesting efforts, and still remains one of my favorite Hitchcock movies.

Jurassic Park," 'Indiana Jones' and 'Jaws' in one exciting, dino-sized bundle of fun.
","Review summary: An instant contemporary thrill classic. I have seen many Dinosaur movies in my life, mostly in my childhood. Okay, so I'm pretty much a suck-up for Dino films when I was younger, but none of these and more can diminish the charm of 'Jurassic Park'. Despite the many films of this kind that I've seen, I couldn't stand to look away from this film. Why? Simple, it's my favorite. Sure, it's not the very best film of all time, mainly because it's one of the films that ushered the age of the famous (or to most, infamous) CGI. The very term 'visual marvel' is defined when I first saw a Brachiosaurus grazing while its puny human watchers are befuddled with wonder. What follows still remains one of the most thrilling, most exciting adventures ever put on screen, perhaps Spielberg's own best adventure since RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK. But I don't just like this movie for the certain charm, or for the boasting CGI dinosaur effects that surpassed anything of its era, but it was really well-one movie in more ways the one. It has a talented direction by Spielberg that made him one of the best filmmakers of Hollywood. It was also unique and very interesting. Another thing would be John Williams superb score and fine performances from the cast. Come to think of it, the CGI and other gimmicks are just peppered to make the film even better (I have seen some screen test featuring the dinosaurs being in stop-motion, not in CGI). This is just some of the reasons why this stands out different from other Dino flicks ('Godzilla' (1998) anyone?).This is definitely not Spielberg's very best movie (for his dreams have come true with 'Schindler's List' the following year, which swept the Oscars including 'Best Picture' and 'Best Director'). But this is no doubt, one of the films he will be best remembered for. It may just be one of my favorite films of all time. Forget the fact that this isn't a movie about human characters or deeper plotting. See it for the still-stunning dinosaur effects and heart-pounding thrill-a-minute situations and find your satisfaction to see a monster movie of A-list caliber. It's the best dinosaur flick ever (like there are any other films that fit the category). Rating: ***** out of 5.",10,3,5,24 May 2007
Beetlejuice," Death never felt so... alive.
","My Take: Burton's wild imagination is painted all over the screen in this outlandish near-classic. Say it once, say it twice, say it thrice. 'Beetlejuice' is really one hilarious ghost comedy from director Tim Burton, it's also one of his funniest. It's full of laughs, jolts, weirdness and everything you want in one hilarious comedy of this kind. More? Well, just see it for yourself.Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis stars a as typical Connecticut-living couple who die in a car accident and great trapped inside their house during the afterlife. But when their home is bought by a family of gimmicky New Yorkers, they mistakenly aid the help of 'bio-exorcist' Beetleguese to scare their uninvited guest away.It's both funny and scary, mainly because of Michael Keaton, who throws a lot of guffaws and jolts all in one package. Danny Elfman's weird music is fine and the lavish (and ghoulish) look at the afterlife is well-imagined and really 'to die for'.Rating: **** out of 5.",8,1,2,9 February 2007
Valkyrie," Good production values and great cast, despite flaws.
","My Take: Tom Cruise and the strong ensemble cast make this an effective popcorn thriller, even if the ending is well-known.Don't let it's initial appearance fool you! Though it may sound like a cinematic browse through history books, VALKYRIE, even with its detailed recreation of the almost-successful assassination of The Fuhrer, is a slick, entertaining Hollywood popcorn thriller. Sure, it's crammed with details, but as entertainment, it's more than serviceable, and yet it doesn't falter to the usual Hollywood trappings. VALKYRIE is that sincere kind of Hollywood entertainment that doesn't let Hollywood turn it into something it's not.Tom Cruise is actually very convincing, not letting his popularity get in the way as a distraction, as one-handed, one-eyed Nazi Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg. Worried about how his family would live under Hitler's Germany, he joins a crack team of conspirators (think OCEAN'S ELEVEN with Nazi uniforms) on a plot to assassinate Hitler (eerily played by David Bamber) and take over his Germany. Ironically, their operation (Operation: Valkyrie) was meant for coups like these.It ain't nearly the most thrilling movie set on offices and war shelters, and it ain't much of a history lesson either. but perhaps the biggest fault of the film is its lack of real suspense or danger. Since we know how it all ends, the suspense being built around the first two acts aren't quite as gripping as its supposed to. But VALKYRIE gets the job done. It's thrilling down to the scenes where the team tries to sneak bombs in near Hitler's side or the scene where Stauffenberg has a one-on-one meeting with The Fuhrer. Terrific performances abound, especially the kind of quality performance we expect from a cast that includes Cruise, Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson and Terence Stamp. Director Bryan Singer and writer Christopher McQuarrie does stick to some of the facts, even if its faithfulness takes some of the excitement away from it. It may not be the most suspenseful thriller ever to come out in years, but it's nonetheless effective. VALKYRIE delivers, flaws aside. Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",7,8,13,28 February 2009
The Wizard of Oz," What childhood would be without it?
","My Take: In almost every way, a landmark in cinema history.After seeing James Cameron's AVATAR yesterday, I think it would be wise to reminisce on the one movie that started it all. Nope, not STAR WARS. It's none other than Victor Fleming's THE WIZARD OF OZ. Yes, all the magic, all the wonders and all the visual accomplishments that we have come to achieve today began in 1939 when Dorothy and Toto set foot on Oz, with the mundane Sepia transforming into pristine Technicolor, as seen for the very first time. Ever since then, THE WIZARD OF OZ has become part of the movie-going culture that it's almost virtually impossible that anyone has not seen it, at least once.I admit it's been a long time since I saw OZ (the last time, I think, was when I was introducing it for the first time to my little brothers), but the memory of seeing it will forever be etched into my mind. Here's a bit of cinema that's hard to forget. Almost everything about it spells 'classic' or 'landmark cinema'. That's a lot to be said about a movie which only started out as a family film, based on L. Frank Baum's books, about a little girl (Garland) and her dog carried away by a freak tornado into a land populated by a good witch, a wicked witch, a walking scarecrow, a heartless Tin Man, a cowardly Lion and a wonderful wizard we have all come to know and love.The music has since become part of culture (I can no longer recall how many times me and a friend of mine quite 'Somewhere Over The Rainbow' during conversations) and the visuals, although not as flashy today, are still as visibly groundbreaking and still absolutely gorgeous. Indeed, the Ruby Slippers are still a treasure, the Emerald City still as emerald is it was and even that multicolored horse in the Merry ol' Land of Oz still looks wonderful. Among other reasons (not to mention, one of the most cleverest twist in disposing of the villain) makes THE WIZARD OF OZ the classic that it was.Rating: ***** out of 5.",10,3,4,22 December 2009
Up in the Air," One of the year's best!
","My Take: An intelligent, down-to-earth dramedy with strong lovable performances and an intelligent script. One of the year's Best movies.Although it was his screenwriter Diablo Cody who got all the praise (and the eventual backlash) for his hit JUNO, director Jason Reitman deserves just as much praise for bringing that lovable quirky hit to life. Following the success of JUNO and THANK YOU FOR SMOKING, his latest film UP IN THE AIR is yet another likable and clever story with a perfect balance of quirky humor and some relevant issues and real down-to-earth humanity. It's also one of the year's very best films and probably the year's wittiest comedy.I love a little mindless escapism as much as the next guy, but sometimes I just want to see a movie where a couple of down-to-earth human beings sit around ad talk to each other in the wittiest ways possible. George Clooney plays Ryan Bingham, whose job is to travel around the United States of America to fire people. Since his boss (Jason Bateman) and the company he works for is, as he described it, too cowardly to do it themselves. He enjoys the life on the open road anyway, and he's already used to living his life on his suitcase (he gives speeches regarding the subject). But just when he is about to reach 10 billion Frequent Flyer miles, his life takes a turn. He meets a woman (Vera Farmiga) he might possibly like intimately and his company finds a possible way to fire people via internet and therefore grounding him on Omaha for good.UP IN THE AIR is not just a another quirky comedy with a Capra-esquire premise and where the lead character is some guy whose been missing out on what's important in life, the characters here are real and relatable, and it's also a movie that is made at the right time where the issues and current events are still relevant. Released at the time America plummeted into economic recession, the issues in UP IN THE AIR are still hot and topical and the movie deals with it realistically instead of giving it the typical Hollywood dumbing-down. Reitman didn't just make a great film, he's made a great film on the right time.After being the first Oscar favorite upon release, I wonder why it couldn't have won at least one of the six Oscars it was nominated for. A win for Best Adapted Screenplay would have been deserving. Reitman's script (co-written by Sheldon Turner; based on the novel by Walter Kirn) is loaded with wit as well as serious drama and some situations that feel like a reality slap. His movies, UP IN THE AIR among others, aren't just quirky comedies; they have this reality in them. Clooney gives one of his best performances (as is the talented Vera Farmiga, here at her spunkiest and most refreshing) while Anna Kendrick gives a career-making one as the newly-hired Natalie Keener. She's not in a lot of movies these days (she was in TWILIGHT), but after UP IN THE AIR, she's should expect a lot of them lining up. If JUNO acknowledged his presence in the movie-going public, his later films like UP IN THE AIR might just put his name on the map. Funny, quirky, but grounded in reality, UP IN THE AIR is another future minor classic alongside Reitman's successful 'little' movie. By all means do not miss one of 2009 very best and smartest movies.Rating: ***** out of 5.",10,0,3,3 April 2010
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Tricky 'Ricky'.
","My Take: One of the most effective comedies in a long time. Most comedians should owe much to Will Farrell, who may be the last best comedian at work in Hollywood to date. After charming me with ELF and then again in ANCHORMAN: THE LEGEND OF RON BURGUNDY, Farrell returns in yet another highly-funny comedy that still proves that Farrell's definition of comedy is just the same as ours. Completely wacky jokes and public satire are surprisingly clever in TALLADEGA NIGHTS: THE BALLAD OF RICKY BOOBY. While it isn't exactly of all tastes (messy humor and crude language may turn off a considerable legion of audience), but it's adult comedy at best. This time, there really are laughs when they mean 'adult humor'.Farrell plays boastful NASCAR driver Ricky Booby, who has it all, from sexy wife (Leslie Bibb), all the money and all the first-place wins he can possible loath. But after a turn in his career, Booby gets a taste of the simple life as a second banana to best friend Cal Naughton Jr. (John C. Reilly) and embarrassed by a daredevil yet gay French racer (Sacha Baron Cohen). Stuck being a pizza boy living with his mom, Booby returns to the fast lane with a little 'help' from his long-lost drunk daddy (Gary Cole).It's racist, noisy and offensive to be sure. But it's also funny, clever and really winning at the same time. TALLADEGA NIGHTS isn't the best and most creative comedy to come out in Hollywood for many years, certainly not the best one out in the year. But with much funnier and more effective term for humor, it's a success all its own for what it is.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",7,1,1,12 July 2008
