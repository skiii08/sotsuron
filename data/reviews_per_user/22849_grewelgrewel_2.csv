The Hangover," i find it funny that this generic comedy has such a high rating
","well basically, seen it, was a decent movie, 7/10.. nothing special, was definitely not up to par with pineapple express or half baked or anything like that, but was a decent mildly funny movie, nothing special really.The Hangover is currently 8.4/10 20,849 votes on IMDb, which of course is not a realistic rating for this movie that isn't even as funny as the naked gun movies (which i enjoyed, but they weren't movie classics like IMDb rating system makes this out to be) , 'Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas' was definitely a top level comedy, just so you know my tastes in all these movies to help you tell just where this movie deserves to be in relation.sure the jokes were vulgar and such but i ain't gonna hate on an artist for expressing creativity or be wild since im a south park and family guy fan.i think everyone is just hyped and in a good mood for summer and their all in good moods, that would be my guess anyways, or maybe the movie makers spent a lotta movie to hire people to enter fake IMDb ratings, i really don't know, but take my word for it, this movie is generic and mildly funny, decently entertaining, but nothing special that hasn't been done by 100000 other generic comedies before it, and thats the truth of the matter.",7,3,6,19 June 2009
Knowing," boring, dull, gaps in the story, etc.. but good special effects
","well gotta say, this was a very very boring, dull movie, yes im a scifi fan (star trek, stargate, yadda yadda) .. but this flick was just dull, wondering around with a list, seeing event after event (which has nothing to do with the end of the world btw) .. and at the end, kids with bunnies are taken and earth is destroyed, with no explanation as to why its being destroyed, just randomly destroyed, was completely retarded to be honest.the movie had no depth to the story, mostly because nothing was explained.. i still dunno why the list was created, why the world was destroyed, who the guys at the end that stole the children.just such a poor movie, im amazed, don't buy this, don't rent it, save your time and go onto another movie, you have been warned.",3,0,1,13 June 2009
