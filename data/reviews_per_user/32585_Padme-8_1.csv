Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," One dream - one movie
","in my opinion Star Wars: The Phantom Menace is one of the best movies ever. It's just like a big dream, a tale of great adventure, of hope, trust and friendship. If you really really love the other Star Wars Movies (A new Hope, The Empire strikes back, Return of the Jedi), you will see the first few seconds of Phantom Menace and you will think 'I'm back at home'. This film is Star Wars and you can feel it every second. Watching this movie really helps you forgetting your sorrows and problems of everyday-life for about 2 hours. It really worths the time and money you have to spend to watch the movie. Even if you don't like the 'old' Star Wars films, maybe the new one will open your eyes and you will be able to see all the magic of this mystical old galaxy, its honorful heros, its wise leaders and its proud warriors. So, enjoy The Phantom Menace and MAY THE FORCE ALWAYS BE WITH YOU !!! MÃ¶ge die Macht mit Euch sein !!!Padme Naberrie",10,0,0,24 November 1999
