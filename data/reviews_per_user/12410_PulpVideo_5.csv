The New World," Con-job, not Art
","If you are not a devotee of Malick, don't waste your time on this one. You won't get it and you won't like it. If you liked that other con-job of Malick's, 'The Thin Red Line,' which was admittedly better than this film (but that's not saying much), you'll want to like this one, because it's more of the trite crap that passes for high-art cinema these days.If, as I do, you genuinely like artistic, metaphorical movies such as those made by Bergman, Fellini, and Godard then I think you will be mightily disappointed by this pretender. The problem, I think, is that Malick tries to straddle two worlds of cinema, believing he can bring high-art to the average movie-watcher, or action-drama to the avant-garde, and he fails at both. If the soldiers in 'The Thin Red Line' weren't a bunch of mournful, whussy poets, he might have had a decent war film, or if he had put his warrior-poets on a metaphorical battlefield using experimental staging techniques, like Lars Von Trier, he might have made a good art-film.As with the English colonists & the Native Americans in 'The New World,' the two cinema cultures do not mix. The whispered, prosaic narratives by Smith (most wrongfully played by Colin Farrell) and Pocahontas (Q'Orianka Kilcher) are trite, uninteresting, and only serve interrupt the flow of the story, where the action & dialogue were doing a sufficient job.The only reason this film was nominated for anything was because the nasty old men of Hollywood just wanted to see Q'Orianka Kilcher at the award ceremonies in a tight, designer dress. Note almost all nominations were for her.Admittedly, the cinematography was outstanding, and the camera-work in the battle scenes truly enhanced the feeling of being in a disorganized melee, but that's just not enough to support a dreadfully boring and otherwise false film.",4,0,5,3 January 2007
Underworld," Disappointing: Rent but don't Buy
","Vampires vs. Werewolves. What could be better for a fan of either or a fan of both? Unfortunately, this movie does not deliver in what could have been, and should have been, one of the coolest vampire/werewolf movies ever made.The whole movie seemed to meander, even in the action scenes. I think there wasn't enough time dedicated to the screenplay, though it seems like the storyline and backstory had been well thought out. This led to the feeling that a lot was implied but left out.Beckinsale looks great in her catsuit and cape, the sets were simple and stayed in the background, but the special effects left a lot to be desired. The werewolf transformations were terrible, and not much more advanced than those in 'American Werewolf in London.' I think they should have sped it up just a little bit more and that might have passed muster. I think it was silly that the professional vampire 'Death Dealers' would stand around in the middle of a fight and wait a few seconds for their opponent to transform into a werewolf. It would have been better to have the transformation occur in the middle of combat, allowing the editor to cut a lot and break the special effect up into more believable bits.I recommend that if you are a vampire and/or werewolf fan, go ahead and rent this move, but please don't spend $20 on it, or you will regret it.",6,0,0,23 January 2004
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," This film has the half-life of Uranium
","The Cold-War may be over, but that doesn't mean a thing to the poignancy of this film in regard to human nature and the military mindset. Even if you are not politically-minded or care much about the nuclear threat, you will find plenty of entertainment in this satirical work by director Stanley Kubrick and actor Peter Sellers (who does a fantastic job of playing several roles in the film). This immortal movie hasn't a boring minute or a single flaw I can think of. I never thought I could be so entertained and feel so good about the end of the world.",10,1,2,9 July 2003
The Descent," Leader of the Splat Pack
","Neil Marshall is perhaps not as prolific as fellow members of the so-called 'Splat Pack,' (Alexandre Aja, Darren Lynn Bousman, Greg McLean, Eli Roth, James Wan, Leigh Whannell & Rob Zombie) but in my opinion, his two full-length films ('Dog Soldiers' & 'The Descent') have already put him at the top of that list. Marshall treats the genre with more maturity, I think, than most of the above directors, and his strong background in drama pays off. While I understand this genre is not big in character development, Marshall brings just enough to add dramatic tension between the characters and make us care about their fates (as with Sarah & Juno in this film).The special effects are excellent, the splatter is not crazily over the top, and the editing is smooth. It also looks like Marshall did some serious research in spelunking for this film, and cinematographer Sam McCurdy did an awesome job with the low lighting in the caves and conveying a sense of claustrophobia. I wish I could comment more about how he handles the subject, but I can't do it without spoilers.This is the first film of this genre (including 'Saw 2,' 'Hostel,' 'The Hills Have Eyes,' 'The Devil's Rejects' and others by fellow Splat Packers) that I have given a rating above 7 (7.2).Without giving away too much, there are Cherokee legends and other Native American stories that do support the concept in this film...",7,0,1,3 January 2007
WALLÂ·E," Fall in Love with Machines Falling in Love (again!)
","WALL-E is the third love story in a row from Pixar, and they just keep getting better at it, as it seems with everything they do. It's only been 2 years since they first made us fall in love with machines falling in love in 'Cars,' yet they have outdone themselves this second time around, pairing two robots separated by centuries and light years of space.As with 'Cars,' the folks at Pixar have gotten us to care so deeply about a pair of machines that during the most touching, romantic moments, the audience was absolutely quiet. At several points in the film I could sense the baited breath and hear the sobs.I'm sure that by now you are familiar enough with the storyline that nothing needs to be said here about its particulars. I will add that it was amazingly unique and quite strong, even though there was barely any dialog between the main characters.What I think was best about the film was the depth of involvement I had with the characters (which the audience clearly shared). I had just come from a more packed showing of 'Hancock' and though it was fun, I just didn't care for the characters nearly as much, even though they were human---well, sorta.The visual effects in 'WALL-E' were as brilliant as any CGI to date, and there is an imaginative 'dance' that is fun to watch. As always, Pixar has done a great job of mixing the very realistic & gritty with the soft & cartoonish.If you have to choose only one movie to go to for the next few weeks, 'WALL-E' is hands down the pick to make, even over 'Hancock.'And, if you are just coming around to collecting Pixar films on DVD, in my opinion, this is a tie for first with 'Finding Nemo.'",9,2,5,6 July 2008
