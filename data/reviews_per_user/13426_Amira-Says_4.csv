Sucker Punch," Could Have Been Good
","They had a good idea, but failed to execute it well. The cut scenes in the fantasy world or whatever you call it, are so out of place and way too long. They should have done those differently. If they would have stuck to their first story and fantasy it would have been fine. The movie is OK to watch once, but I wouldn't have any desire to see it a second time.",3,3,10,10 July 2017
Gravity," Painful To Watch
","It is obvious that they try to drag every single scene as long as possible in an effort to fill the time. This movie is essentially a monologue and it is not a good one. It is painfully slow. The first scene when she gets separated without contact lasts a good five minutes when it should have been 1 minute at most. She is separated, lost contact, OK we've got it move on. I appreciate what the the original writers were going for, but unfortunately they allowed mainstream Hollywood to get a hold of it and destroy any potential it might have had. Let's face it, mainstream cinema just can't truly make an independent idea into a good film. No exception here. It gets one star for the concept and one star for casting Sandra Bullock. She did the absolute best with what she had.",2,0,1,10 July 2017
The Aviator," It's endless
",This movie is painful to sit through. It just drags and drags. Each time you think you are finally getting to the end it drags and drags again. There is no excuse for this movie to be this long as the events don't properly fill it. It is yet another di caprio movie that they feel they must drag on for almost three hours simply because he is in it. This is one of those movies that people pretend to like simply because it is a Martin Scorsese flick. I would give someone $100 if they were able to actually pay attention to this bore all the way through twice! Very unlikely.,1,1,4,10 July 2017
Sicario," Emily Blunt Awful. Del Toro Amazing.
","Del Toro is the only reason people can make it to the end. Emily Blunt is already unlikable and to throw her into a weak and unlikable character just really made her presence that much worse. So if you are in love with Del Toro is it worth watching once. If you aren't you better just pass on this film. You expect her character to eventually get better and grow as most do when they face issues, but her character started weak and unlikable and it only got worse as the film went on. Del Toro took complete control of his role and where he is in it, it is amazingly. Sadly, he just does not get enough screen time to really make it worth it. I'm not surprised this movie didn't win any awards. I would have been more surprised if it had.",3,4,7,29 January 2016
