The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," This movie is actually kind of good
","The first time I saw this movie by myself, I did not really enjoy it because I kept looking for things that were in the book, like the part where Bella decided to truly go to college and not become a vampire for a few years, and felt that leaving that out actually changed the flavor of the movie.However, watching the movie a second time with my kids (who I was screening the movie for the first time I saw it), I no longer had any unmet expectations and actually enjoyed watching this film.I really think they should have considered making this movie more of an adult film to do the book justice and probably could have made the credits Volturi scene a little less campy, and I am still wondering where the psychic body guards are that in the book are always behind the Volturi, but no director yet has chosen to show...",7,2,9,28 November 2011
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," Movie OK - but not exceptional
","CONTAINS SPOILERS!!! For the most part, since I have read the books and seen all the movies, I understood what was being placed on the screen, but this movies flow is quite disjointed. It seemed as if the primary concern of the editors was to keep the two parts of Breaking Dawn under 2 hrs, so they cut back very considerably on developing a story and the tons of additional characters that had about 30sec of screen time, and seemed to be in a mad rush for the finish line. I found it to be entertaining, but as a 'purist' I had one really big issue with this movie when placed in context of all the other films. Alice is not supposed to be able to see werewolves in her visions to the point that their presence acts like a radar jammer even when she is not trying to see THEM. In this movie they threw that 'fact' completely out the window. The result was fun to watch but created what I consider a very large logical disconnect with the overall storyline of the series.",7,2,8,23 November 2012
