Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Perhaps could have been better, but worth the wait.
","The movie could have done well without Jar Jar Binks, and could have used more battling in space. The special effects, however, were everything I had anticipated. I can never get enough of those lightsabres.",Null,0,0,17 August 2000
Blade Runner," Good for the Sci-Fi Channel
","Recently, the Sci-Fi Channel aired the original version of this movie in letterbox format and with minimal editing. I was elated. I didn't have a copy of my own and, these days, it seems that only used copies of the original, in VHS format, are available, while the director's cut overloads store shelves in the form of both VHS and DVD. I have no use for the director's cut, except the satisfaction of curiosity. (It is, after all, a movie adaptation of Philip K. Dick's 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?'. Besides, the director's cut lacks Harrison Ford's narrative, which is like the Mona Lisa lacking her smile.) Anyway, the original release is one of the precious few that does justice to the small amount of printed science fiction that is very good.The Sci-Fi Channel is to be commended.",Null,0,0,29 August 2000
