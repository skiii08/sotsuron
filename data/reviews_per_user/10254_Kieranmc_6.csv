The Sound of Music," If you've missed it consider yourself lucky.
","This is without doubt the most over inflated musical dross. It's reputation is better than the film itself. Rodgers and Hammerstein have done far better than this, but for some reason this is considered their classic work.Everything about it is predictable, contrived and trite. The songs are embarressingly simplistic. Forty years later and uncountable TV screenings later the film offers nothing in the way of entertainment. If you missed it count yourself lucky.",2,17,44,7 May 2000
Ed Wood," Best of the worst
","Ed Wood was the best bad Hollywood film maker. It takes a particular genius to create truely aweful films, films that are so bad, they are almost great.Ed Wood (the movie) is a wonderful homage to a truely bad film maker. Made, ironically, by one of cinemas great film makers.Tim Burton has an obvious affection for Wood and his bizzare entourage. He doesn't make fun of them, rather presenting them as eccentric and unusual; colourfull and rather charming.The film follows Wood's professional career from backlot worker to his 'masterpiece' Plan 9 from Outer Space. This is not a film about failure, rather it is a celebration of the human creative spirit. Wood's indominitable belief in himself and his actors raises him to majestic heights, particularly his relationship with Bela Lugosi.
Beautifully shot in crisp black and white, the film is almost a pastiche of fifties B movies; the script and acting are wonderfully wooden. It's to Burton's credit that he carries this of so well.The cast are a joy to watch, in particular Bill Murray as the failed transsexual, Jeffrey Jones as Cresswell, a ham psyhic and Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi. Landau's preformance is a revelation after some of his hamier preformances in bad 70s' TV shows.Ed Wood is a film for all lovers of film, good or bad. It not only tells the story of Ed Wood, it captures the magic of a movie maverick.",10,0,0,29 May 2000
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Who's running the mad house?
","The beauty of Kubrick is that he allows us to laugh at our fears, and at ourselves. I was quite young when the arms race, cold war etc was at it's height, and can remember the very real fear that any day we would be wiped out. The extreme views of the characters aren't fiction, I can remember debates about 'acceptable' civilian losses in the event of a bomb being dropped.Kubrick satirises this wonderfully, capturing the insanity of a world gone mad. Sellers is at his peak. His performances controled and acurate; his best films are from this era.That the Dr Strangelove should be working for the American Government is not far fetched, many escaped nazis' found refuge in allied counteries where their particular 'skills' were used. In fact all the characters are real, they were around in the 50s' and can still be heard today!The message of the film really is: Who's running the mad house? In a world where Slim Pickens broncho rides an atom bomb and Keenan Wynn warns Sellers that if he survives the holocaust he'll have to answer to the Coco Cola Company for damaging their vending machine you know you are better off laughing at the pure insanity of it all.",10,2,2,27 April 2000
The Exorcist," Needs a laugh track.
","It does have it's moments of genuine fear and suspense. But taken as a whole The Exorcist really needs a laugh track. Spinning heads and pea soup vomiting is just a bit much! I worked in a hospital casualty on the film release, the number of hysterical admissions following the film was amazing.",7,0,1,10 May 2000
Schindler's List," Compelling true horror.
","Schindler's List grips from it's first moments and holds audiences far beyond the final credits. Spielberg documents Otto Schindler's success in saving many Jews from the horror of Nazi death camps. More importantly the film chronicles, in horrific detail, the nightmare that Polish Jews went through.Thankfully avoiding sentimentality or romanticism Spielberg takes us into the gettos and camps, dispassionately observing moments of heartbreaking tragedy, we watch horrified as a young Jewish woman, an architect, is shot for being right, or as the camp commander 'plays' with the Jewish prisoners by shooting them from his balcony.Shot in stark black and white (except for the final ten minutes) the film convies beautifully the worst and the best of humanity. One exceptional touch is worth mentioning; as Schindler watches, in black & white, the Jews being hearded from the getto, he spots a little girl in a red coat, the camera follows her until she is swallowed into the teeming crowds. Later we see the red coat on a lorry of disgarded clothing, but no little girl.Spielberg has never been better and no Hollywood film has captured so accurately the human tragedy of the Hollocaust.",10,9,13,26 April 2000
2001: A Space Odyssey," Unique cinema
","I first saw 2001 at the Cinerama cinema in London at the time of the films release. On the giant Cinerama screen the film reveals it's true wonder; TV sadly diminishes it. 2001 is a visual feast. Kubrick blends inspiring images with equally inspiring music, creating a symphonic film.I still watch 2001, 30 odd years after it's release and marvel at the technical skill, the depth of it's meanings and the scale of it's story. I have my own feelings of what it is really about but there is not enough space here to go into that.There is no other film to compare 2001 with, the sequel 2010 wasn't at all in the same league and is best forgotten. 2001 has to be seen, it can't be explained or summarised. I watched it again recently with a young friend who had only heard of it. His reaction? Silence followed by: Wow!",10,1,3,26 April 2000
