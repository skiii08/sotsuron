Kill Bill: Vol. 2," the revenge is great
","Kill Bill Vol. Two is a great sequel. It is interesting, as well as action packed. It was as good as the first, if not better. It has more plot twists than the first movie, and also explains some things from the first movie that was hard to understand.In Kill Bill Vol. 2 the bride continues her mission to kill Bill. With two assassins out of the way, she only has two more to go before she gets to Bill. She hunts down Budd (Michael Madsen), Bills little brother, and then goes for Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah). Before she gets to Bill she learns that her daughter, that she thought she lost, was actually alive. Bill was the father of this child and now has the girl. Will this stop the bride from killing Bill, or will she have no compassion when she gets to his lair in Mexico? I think this movie was very good. It would have been better if it was one movie instead of two. I watched both movies one after the other and it was much better. Then it seems like one great movie. It has many twists in the second movie that are so important. They could change the decision of the bride or not. She has vowed revenge against Bill, but will she succeed? If you like movies, then you would want to see Kill Bill Vol. 1 & 2. They will keep you on the edge of you seat and wanting more.",Null,0,1,13 October 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," A great movie by far
","If you want to see a feel good movie or, if you're faint of heart this is not the movie for you. If you like blood and revenge, then Kill Bill Vol.1 is the movie for you. I would highly recommend seeing this movie. It is an action thriller. Kill Bill was directed by Quinton Tarantino.It starts out with a young bride who is in the 'Deadly Viper Assassination Squad.' She wants to leave the team for a normal life. The leader, Bill (David Carradine), has the bride (Uma Thurman) watch them kill her wedding party. Then he shoots her in the head, putting her in a coma for four years. When she awakes, she has vowed revenge. This two part series is very gory. She hunts down the team starting at the bottom and working her way up to Bill. First, she hunts down Vernita Green, aka 'Copperhead,' (Vivica A. Fox) and fights her in her own home. Then, she goes to Okinawa to find Hattori Hanzo, a master sword maker, for a sword to go after O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu). They have a magnificent battle on a snow covered Japanese garden. This movie has more action than you can imagine. The plot is very intriguing and dramatic. I like the way it always has something happening, and it is fast paced. This is a movie that you can watch many times. The first movie defiantly makes us want to see the second one. The movie has blood and body parts flying everywhere. One critic even says it's the goriest movie ever released in the U.S. Quinton Tarantino has outdone himself on this series. Like his other classic's Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, and Jackie Brown, Tarantino proves he can still make an original idea into a movie.",Null,0,1,13 October 2004
Braveheart," I thought it was a great film.
","Braveheart was a great movie. It showed many aspects of a good movie. It wonderfully showed how the battles were held. It showed how they dressed, lived, and even talked. The reproductions of clothes and buildings are amazing. The director even throws in a love story to make it interesting for the female viewers. Even though Braveheart is a little less than three hours, it goes by fast. The movie is about William Wallace (Mel Gibson). It goes all the way from his childhood to his inspiration as a leader, even to his gruesome death. Sweeping, stirring, and moving, this epic is right up there with Ben Hur and other classic epic of movie history. The battles are amazing. They succeeded in showing how massed battles in the middle ages were conducted. They were frightening and fast. They were very bloody and they were very emotional. The battles in Braveheart are very suspenseful, and keep you on the edge of your seat. The film also works as a love story. The love story is excellently done, and moving. The scenes between Wallace and Myron are tender and gentle. It gives Wallace a reason to rebel without looking like a bloody warrior. Even though Wallace never really sacked York, but merely died in York, the movie continues. It seems to make it more interesting. All performances in Braveheart are great. Gibson himself- coping with the Scottish accent- turn in as a stunning performance. His expression of disbelief and dejection when he learns of Bruce's deception is magnificent. The fact that Mel directed the movie and performed in the movie is magnificent. The supporting cast is impressive. Patrick McGoohan's ruthless Edward Longshanks is very sinister. Sophie Marceau's French princess is compassionate and tender. Wallace's men are great for familiar faces in battle, and also help the plot be comical as well as light relief. This film will make you want to cry and love. It really pulls you in with the love story, the rebellions, and the wars. It is a classic that defiantly will be in your home video collection.",Null,0,1,7 March 2003
