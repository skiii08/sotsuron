Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Oh Dear, a remake! George, spare us please.
","The phantom menace is simply star wars remade.  Made the way George Lucas would have made A New Hope if he'd had the technology.  There are so many similarities between it and the previous 3 Star Wars films it's unreal. 1)Opening with a space battle. Hmmm! didn't star wars open very much like this? 2)Jedi meet with student. once again we've seen this before. 3)Pod racing-made me think about lukes speech on beggars canyon. 4)To the tatooine space port. Mos Eisley, anybody? 5)Droids in workshop. like father like son, Luke fixes 3PO and R2! 6)Attacking the green planet. Endor, Endor, Endor. where were the Ewoks? 7)Jabba's slave girl. seen that outfit somewhere before, Leia wore it! 8)Jedi fight Sith Lord(pronouced syth-si, ok Samuel Jackson?). Kenobi vs Vader on the Deathstar, or vs Luke on Cloudcity or the new Deathstar) 9)Attacking a big space station. the trench sequence? 10)Being presented with medals. the end of Star Wars.ok. George Lucas has ripped himself off, and conned the punters. Neeson and McGregor hold the film together. Jake Lloyd looks out of his depth in every scene. Ray Parks was killed off too easily and should have been used more.All in all - what a waste of time and money. it could have been so much more. George, you must redeem yourself",Null,0,1,16 July 1999
