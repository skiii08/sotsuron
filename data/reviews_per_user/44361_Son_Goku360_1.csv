Alien 3," hated it could've been WAY better
","Yeah okay, it was really good as a drama film but sucked as an Alien film. I must say that I was very disappointed when I first saw this film, actually I have not rented Alien 3 or Resurrection since I first saw them. First off they killed Hicks and Newt. How could they ****ing do that? Especially to Newt? We knew right at the end of Aliens, should there have been sequel, that they were going to continue the surrogate mother-daughter relationship b/w Newt & Ripley. And we would see another relationship with Hicks. So What do they do? They kill our favorite Aliens characters off. I hate to say it, but even if Fincher stuck with the original script, we would still see the deaths of Newt and Hicks. Secondly, there was no character development at ALL. NOTHING. All we know is everyone (besides Ripley) is a rapist/murderer/etc. You don't really seem to give damn about the characters. The only character development I see is with Clemens, but he gets killed off too. For those of you who like Alien 3 or feel sorry for it, I've read the same reviews you have. The original director left the project like two months in, and David Fincher I believe had very little time to develop a good script resulting in the lack of character depth. However, did it ever occur to them that there was a reason James Cameron left Ripley, Newt, Hicks, and Bishop alive? The main purpose for almost all of the prisoners was to just get killed by the Alien. Third off, what the **** was with the autopsy? Who the **** put that in the script? I don't know you, but that was just plain SICK. The whole thing with the dog getting impregnated was also kind of sick (although I understand in the Special Edition re-release changed it to a cow for something like that). And also how the hell does Fincher expect to end the series with such a **** up movie? Come on! And fourth, they could've at least made the freakin movie actually take place ON Earth, if not, then what the hell is with their damn tagline? Overall a REAL Disappointment. I'm sorry to those like this movie. I have not seen the re-released version, but I understand it's much better.",2,3,6,18 April 2006
