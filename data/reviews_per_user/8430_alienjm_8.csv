This movie is an absolutely breathtaking and affect all the people that see this film, it affected me so much. This movie grab your neck and doesn't let you go and makes you to stay in your seat.

Jaws," Best Thriller Ever Made
","Jaws was the first frightening film I saw when I was a kid, at that age, it gave me a lot of nightmares. Is an important and very special movie for me, it contains the best scariest speech in cinematic history: The story of U.SS Indianapolis that is related by Quint (Robert Shaw), this scene is an instant classic, is one of my favorite scenes of all time, but the truth is that after seen the movie, I made a presentation of various shipwrecks and one of theme was the Indianapolis, I related the story of the Indianapolis and I spoke like Robert Shaw, in a moment I thought that I was him, an iconic character for me and, of course an iconic and symbolic scene. Jaws have also memorable scary scenes, Sheyder and Dreyfuss do a great job but the hero for me is Shaw, probably his best role. Another important thing is the soundtrack, the main theme is considered an absolute classic by all. It the was the first time that a soundtrack caused so many fear and panic to people of getting in the water, that means that Spielberg did his job. Jaws is a masterpiece that you can't get tired of see it.",10,2,5,25 July 2013
