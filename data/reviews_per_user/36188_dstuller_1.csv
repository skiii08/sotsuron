Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Disappointed
","Overloaded with animation. I think George waited too long to make this, because to me it seemed that he forgot the formula he used on the first 3 episodes. The best part of the movie is the last 30 minutes where the action involves mostly people - not animated characters. I hope in episode 2 he gets rid of a lot of that crap & goes back to basics. George also forgot that the 'kids' that were drawn to his Star Wars movies originally are now anywhere in the 30-50 year old range. They're the ones that wanted the most to see the continuing saga. And do me a favor George -- kill Jar Jar in the first 30 seconds of episode 2.",Null,0,1,29 April 2000
