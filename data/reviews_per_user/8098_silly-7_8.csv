Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I envisioned something..........
","About one year ago, in that strange hour when you are half-asleep and half awake, I envisioned something. I envisioned a movie so grand that it would change the face of the motion-picture industry forever.  A movie that would combine lavish effects, a seasoned screenplay, and very important themes about good and evil- and seamlessly integrate these aspects into one coherent whole.  A movie that would be transgenerational in its appeal, so that a 5 year old youngster could sit side by side with a 90 year old and be linked by a common bond.  On May 17th, 1999, this vision of mine came to life.  This vision was 'The Phantom Menace'.",10,0,0,2 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Best
","Phantom Menace is the most interesting, thought provoking, and entertaining films ever to grace the screen.  It's unfortunate that people can't enjoy it for what it's worth, instead of constantly comparing it to the original trilogy.  As much as i like the original trilogy, this movie is definitely on a different level.  The screenplay, special effects, acting, cinematography- these are all better in Phantom Menace than any of the originals.  Furthermore, Lucas does a wonderful job of setting up what's to come in the future(i.e the rise of the empire and the downfall of Anakin). Every single scene in this movie has a definitive purpose, and only after a few viewings can a person decipher this.  The plot works so seamlessly it is amazing.I think people hate the movie because they are too stupid too understand it. In the first trilogy, Lucas got criticized for making his movies too simple.  Now he has put together a wonderfully complex story, and yet now in ironic fashion the viewers want a simpler story.  They don't have the attention span for a movie this complex, and they take out this anger by bashing this movie.  I am sorry folks, but Lucas didn't make this movie for idiots.  He made it for people who like to think,  true fans who are willing to analyze films.And for those people bashing Jar Jar, I think you are pathetic.  It is clear Lucas made this character to appeal to young people, and he needed this because this plot was too complex for the average child(or even adult unfortunately) to understand.George, if you are reading this, I want to thank you personally for creating such a thought-provoking, entertaining and imaginative film.  I know that many people are ripping down your film, but don't worry(I don't think you are).  10 years from now people will look back at this film in awe, not only for its amazing special effects but for its masterful storytelling and thought-provoking ideas.  I have seen this movie 7 times and loved it every time, and I plan to see it at least 3 more times. People love to tear successful people down because they are jealous.  Well, you are truly a genius, in every sense of the word.  I have an incredible amount of respect for you.  Just keep sticking to your roots and everything will turn out fine.",10,0,0,22 July 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Phantom Menace is underrated
","I know you probabably think I'm crazy by saying that the Phantom Menace is underrated (given its incredible hype), but I feel content with my statement.  I have read a number of the previous user comments on this movie, and I disagree with about 90% of them.  There have been a number of people who have criticized the lack of emotion in the movie, especially with the young Anakin Skywalker, and I can't understand why.  Jake Lloyd plays an incredibly convincing young boy who is full of innocence and eager to become a Jedi, and his unbridled enthusiasm makes this all believable.  People expect him to act they way an older, more mature person would act.  But you have to understand that he is a 6 year old boy, and children tend to display their emotions quite differently than adults.  As for the other actors, they all added an equally impressive emotional impact to the film. When you combine the emotional impact with the incredible special effects in the film, you can truly understand why Phantom Menace is so special.",10,0,0,4 June 1999
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Pure genius!
","Dr. Strangelove is perhaps the funniest and most creative movie to ever come out of the film industry.  The parody of the cold war and the supposed 'doomsday device' pokes fun at a serious issue in global politics at the time, yet manages to steer clear of actually criticizing the idea of nuclear warfare.  The main characters, Jack Ripper(the psychotic general infatuated with preserving precious bodily fluids), Chief of Staff Ingridsen(a crazed politician afraid of 'commies'), and Dr. Strangelove(an insane nuclear scientist with interesting ideas about man's future), are all crucial in turning this interesting story into a memorable film event.  Kudos to Kubrick, who also co-wrote the screenplay, as well as producing and directing the film.",10,1,1,9 June 1999
Schindler's List," Excellent movie
","Schindler's List is undoubtedly one of Spielberg's finest films, and there countless reasons why.  Spielberg is able to portray Oskar Schindler(Liam Neeson) as a womanizer, shrewd businessman, and profiteer of the war in a way that does justice to the character's complexity.  Through the use of black and white he brings you back to the time of the Holocaust, while using color in the present to bridge the gap between past and present.  In particular, the use of black and white to identify the Holocaust is appropriate given the brutal nature of the event.  People dream in color, but they have nightmares in black and white.  The scenes themselves help show the facelessness of the Holocaust and the horror it brought to its victims.  In particular, there is one scene in which a number of Jews are forced into a shower expecting to be gassed.  The looks on their faces, along with the moving music, makes this scene one of tremendous fright. Although in this scene the Jews are not gassed, the message of this scene is there- even when Jews were not being killed, they were subject to horrors beyond the imagination of the human mind- everyone was a victim, including those who were not killed.  All in all, Spielberg uses the medium to his advantage and recreates in vivid detail much of the Holocaust, while also telling a story of how one overcomes his ignorance to help others in the end.",10,11,16,7 June 1999
Titanic," Simply the best movie ever.
","Titanic is simply the best movie ever, and it will stay that way forever. All you hear about is the incredible special effects of the movie(which I admit are great) However, what makes Titanic so memorable is the engaging love story.  Leonardo DiCaprio gives the performance of his career as an enthusiastic, unselfish bum who saves a young woman(Kate Winslet) from leading a shallow, predictable life.  I am sick and tired of people ripping DiCaprio's performance because he was simply perfect for the role.  I am hardpressed to find another actor that could exhibit the freshness and excitement of DiCaprio.  Kate Winslet was incredibly believable as a spoiled, rich brat who wants to lead a more exciting life.  The movie also had light touches of humour which helped to balance its serious nature. All in all, a wonderful movie.  Kudos to James Cameron!",10,1,3,7 June 1999
Back to the Future," this movie is amazing
","Back to the future has to been considered one of the greatest films of all time.  There is no other movie that can match its entertainment value, isn't that why we see movies in the first place?  It is that simple.  The movie keeps you in suspense from the moment it begins to the very end.  The characters are creative and amazing.  The chemistry between Marty and Doc is both funny and eery, probably the best duo in film history.  It appeals to both young and old as well.",10,2,3,9 June 1999
Goodfellas," Worth seeing
","Upon the first viewing of Goodfellas, one has to be struck by its fast-paced and entertaining nature.  This is a rare kind of movie that makes you feel as though you are part of the action, and it doesn't do this through incredible special effects.  Rather, Goodfellas wraps you in because of superb acting and filming, a captivating screenplay, and an engaging soundtrack- all the elements of a great movie.There is no denying this is one of the best films of this decade. However, I do not think  this movie is flawless, as many on this website believe. While the first hour of the movie is entertaining, the second half gets bogged down with overly extended scenes- in particular the one where Henry Hill thinks he is being followed.  The movie loses the punch that it had in the beginning.  It's as though Scorsese got sick and tired of making the movie and he decided to speed up the process a bit, and this results in the last hour of the movie being a bit cumbersome.Nevertheless, Goodfellas is a fine move that is worth seeing for anyone interested in entertaining films.",Null,0,0,12 July 1999
