Minority Report," Three S's, Screenplay, Script and Spielberg make it great.
","A simplest advice that I want to share, do not miss the smallest dialog of the film. It probably has the best script since The Matrix for an action/triller film. In my opinion it is not a total si-fi. It may have a futuristic look, but it is a mixture of human drama, excellent action sequences and a superb plot. Tom Cruise was better in this movie. Nothing to say about direction, it was proved long before that Spielberg is one of the greatest director of all time; 'The Minority Report' is just another great creation. I particularly liked the escape sequence of Cruise and Morton.The casting was excellent. Max Von Sydow plays the coolest Negative Role who finally manages to get some sympathy from some viewers. All in all a great treat for eyes. So, enjoy the film.",10,0,0,28 July 2002
Batman Begins," Batman's Begun with undeniable entertainment
","Cris Nolan draws a master piece once more (previously in Memento).. apparently he is very 'Handsomely efficient' in telling past stories. This batman WILL make you forget there was ever any Batman before this.Mr. Bale in Bat suit looks much better, and without as well.. and the cast, without a doubt has been awesome. Michael Kane as in Alfred I thought the most appropriate. And on the opposite side Katie Holmes looked absolutely stunning.. just how a comic super hero's girlfriend should look like.. Morgan Freeman was not what one would except, but he did not much to do in the film either.The special effects were awesome, Gotham looked more realistic and one can actually relate Gotham to the Comic Book Gotham we see. All in all ..the best treat for summer yet.. an undeniable entertainment",10,1,2,18 June 2005
Million Dollar Baby," Brilliant!!
","This is a kind of a movie you want to keep in your collections, because these kind never gets old.Hilary Swank gave out her best performance yet. It's a performance you want to see holding an Oscar. Beautiful script and an excellent story. Eastwood knew exactly how far to stretch the tragedy, which he might have missed in the Mystic River.A smooth touch by some very strong performances from the supporting actors like Freeman and Baruchel get every bit of the beginning of the movie going. And when Swank takes it off, it's all about her. The movie shows how the character grows in mental strength with every fight and breaks apart with just one truth. Swank's performance was so great along with the script that you don't even feel the change until it was obvious.I personally think it was better than Raging Bull. I think it connects you emotionally more to the character than the Bull's. All in all a great entertainer and a must see movie.",10,3,6,17 March 2005
The Matrix," the matrix 'really' has you
","Unfortunately no one can be told what the matrix is.. u have to see it for your self .. an awesome film with outstanding special effect and one of the best scripts of all time. Wachowski Bros show how a pretty common SI-FI story can make a lot of difference in the theater.Without a the simplest of redundant dialog, the movie flows like a smooth velvet. And unlike many other films, I guess they didn't try to give any arbitrary special effect or anything. Even  I felt, the room number of Neo, 101 sounds a bit like Neo, and 303 sounds a bit like Trinity.. :).. which is kind of cool.. when the smallest things look finer, it feels great..
It leaves a loads of mystery to uncover in the sequel, like 'Zayan', the only human city, and the love-story of Neo and Trinity, what happens to Oracle and her spoon-benders.. and surly the 4 of them can't fight against all the AI's. So.. who would be the other people to fight with them...
Hope the next one would be as good as this one.. and if it isn't.. 'fate it seems'.. :-)",10,0,1,17 January 2003
