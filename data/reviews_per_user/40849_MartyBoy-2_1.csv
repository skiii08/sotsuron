The Blair Witch Project," Did I miss something???
","Ok - This film is scary. How a low budget, non-eventful movie ever got the publicity and praise scares me to death.What next? A film of grass growing, which arguably would have been more entertaining than this over-hyped 'suspense'.Ever since the Sundance Film Festival, this movie has suffered the worst case of 'The Emperors' New Clothes' syndrome I have ever seen. Once a few intelligent people put it on a pedestal, anyone who differs an opinion is made to look a fool. This doesn't apply to me - I already feel a fool for shelling out hard-earned cash.Don't misunderstand me - I like a good movie. It doesn't have to be full of special effects or blood & gore. Just a reason to sit still for nearly two hours is normally enough.I walked in to the Cinema with big expectations for a film I had heard so much about. I couldn't wait for it to begin. After ninety minutes, the exact opposite applied. I walked out feeling totally let down by the media and almost demanded my money back from the Cinema manager!I have no complaints over the actors or their acting - they gave first class performances, although the kind of method acting they were subject to was a little extreme and probably the reason why they came across the way they did.Apparently before the US release of this film, a documentary on the Blair Witch entitled, 'The Curse of the Blair Witch' was aired. I am led to believe that this was used as an appetiser for the movie, explaining various portions which the film alone couldn't do. This might have been a start. TCOTBW was eventually shown two days after the UK opening. A little late, I feel.This situation bears more load onto why the US and UK releases of films should be simultaneous. We (the UK population) wouldn't have had the misleading 'hype' we received and could have watched the film at face value.Verdict : You get what you pay for - Don't expect a $30,000 epic.",Null,0,1,3 November 1999
