Marie Antoinette," The French Revolution, if made into a Disney ride
","My wife made me watch this one. She even had to admit that when it was over, she didn't like it either. There really isn't anything to learn from this 'visual lard', as another reviewer aptly put. It did remind me of a bad wedding cake, all fancy icing designs, but tasting like sugar and lard. Sophia Coppola may have good taste in music, but her directing style has no substance. Also, while I liked most of the 80's tunes she used in the movie, they seemed jarringly out of place in this fluffy period piece. This was supposed to be about Marie Antionette and her life, which was mainly defined by the French Revolution and the fact that she was beheaded! Why was it fluffy and trite?Sophia portrays Marie as an innocent valley girl socialite, complete with little dog accessory and penchant for partying and attaining ugly shoes! At the same time, we are supposed to sympathize with her, even though she never seems to care about anybody but herself. I was actually looking forward to seeing her get beheaded. They didn't even show anything! The utter cop-out of an ending just showed her and her socially retarded husband riding away like they were leaving on a holiday, to use a British term! There was one brief scene of the peasants shouting gibberish while Antionette goes out on the balcony and does some stupid bow for some unfathomable reason. The crowd, when shown for a brief few seconds, looked like a bunch of people going to the Renaissance Fair of something! They looked nothing like starving, mad-as-hell poor French people! That was ridiculous.The casting seemed strange as well. Poor Kirsten Dunst seemed completely out of her element. She didn't even attempt an Austrian accent! Also, when she is shown undressing, she looked dangerously underweight! It wasn't sexy! What is it about female actresses and their refusal to eat normally? Rip Torn looks bizarre here in French garb, and Molly Shannon and Jason Shwartzman seems completely miscast as well. There really was no depth to French culture shown here as well. It seemed as if virtually no research was put into this. Overall, this movie just had nothing in it I liked.",1,3,5,19 March 2007
Corpse Bride," Tim Burton Just Doing the Same Old Thing Again
","I saw this movie in the theater with my wife. There were at least 2 other movies I would have rather seen. She loved it, but me, well, I didn't hate it, but I didn't exactly like it either. It just seemed like a conglomeration of most of Burton's earlier works. People call Tim Burton a genius. He is talented at repackaging the same thing over and over, and getting lots of money for it, I guess. He's definitely NOT a genius. People keep comparing this to Nightmare, and rightly so. It came from Tim Burton, was claymation, and was about animated dead people. It did remind me a lot of BeetleJuice also. Dancing skeletons seem to be a popular motif in his movies. I guess what bugged me the most were the characters. They completely lacked depth, except for maybe the main character, yet her back story was sorely underdeveloped. WAS she killed by her groom to be, or a stranger? WHY was she killed? Was the bad guy who tried to wed Victoria the groom to be of the corpse bride AND her killer? Why did he want to kill Victoria so badly? It doesn't really matter. Another reviewer was nitpicking the plot of this movie, saying things like 'How does the corpse bride know all of the dead people if she was under a tree all of the time?' I started to wonder, then thought, 'The movie is about animated DEAD people! It's fantasy! On a good note, the animation was well done, but in 2005 that's no big feat.",5,2,7,11 October 2005
Meet the Fockers," Contrived, false, not funny in the least
","I never saw 'Meet the Parents' and I really didn't want to see this movie, but my wife stumbled upon it while it was playing on HBO last night, and proceeded to watch it. I love my wife dearly, but alas, her tastes in movies is not the same as mine, and that's the nicest way I can put it! I really hated this movie. There really wasn't anything funny about it. I'm so sick of Ben Stiller! He's NOT FUNNY! I loved 'There's Something About Mary', and Ben was okay in that, but not particularly funny. Why does he continually appear in unfunny movies? Why, oh why? Also, unlike 'Mary', none of the other people in this stink pile were even remotely funny. Sometimes I can enjoy a movie that is supposed to be funny but isn't, but this wasn't one of those. There really wasn't anything interesting or engaging at all. Every 'joke' could be seen a mile away and every 'joke' fell flat. Even the pets weren't funny! The fact that this Fockin crap made so much money in the U.S. makes me want to hide my head in shame. Also, Owen Wilson needs to go away and never come back! When he appears (contantly) with Ben, I want to smoke crack!",1,3,4,14 November 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," This film has NO MATURITY in it!
","Why is this stinker rated so high? It stunk on just about every level. Even the special effects! I admit, there was the sense that it took a lot of time and money to do the special effects, but there was nothing groundbreaking about them, and it got to the point of special effects overload. I love science fiction movies, but there must have been a record breaking amount of scenes of alien cities and spaceships landing and taking off. I agree with most of the other bad reviews in that the dialogue was atrocious. The same was true for the last 2 movies before this. The acting and story were bad, as well. A six year old could write a more intelligent story! The proverbial nail in the coffin for me was the wookie doing the 'Tarzan' yell while swinging into battle. Not funny or amusing in the least. Also, I don't see the appeal of stupid computer generated yoda.There were so many groan inducing scenes in this movie, I cannot list them all; it would take too long. I guess that the main thing that bothered me about this movie was its complete lack of maturity or sophistication. This was true in the first 3 movies, but I enjoyed them much more, maybe because I was very young when I saw them. This should not be considered true science fiction. It is more like Disney kiddie fantasy with goofy aliens and silly robots. The 'force' is just another name for magic, as well! Also, has dorky Lucas EVER HAD A HOT CHICK IN ANY OF HIS MOVIES??? Is he afraid of them? You could count all the females from all of his Star Wars films on one hand, and none of them were really hot! Whats-her-name was cute at best! Well, I guess the only good thing I can say about this crap-fest is now there shouldn't be any more!",1,7,12,16 December 2005
300," Stupid and Forgettable. Waaay Overrated.
","I agree with a lot of the negative postings. This was really ridiculous and annoying. I am not a movie snob or anything, but this movie was extremely overrated and dumb. I almost fell asleep a few times. At one point I thought I was watching Disney's 'Hunchback of Notre Dame'.I thought Persians were ancient Iranians, so why were they Black here? Also, since the filmmaker loves violence and gore, it was done very stupidly in this movie. For instance, the blood that 'flung' out when someone got cut just disappears and never appears on the ground. When someone is beheaded, there should be a fountain of blood spurting out, but here, there is no blood! The electric guitar riffs throughout the monotonous fight scenes also added to the stupidity. Were piercings really in fashion that long ago?",1,7,14,21 April 2009
