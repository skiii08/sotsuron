Vertigo," Colorfull Movie !!
","I admire Hitshcock movies . The Shades were very amazing . This green took me away many times in the movie .At the beggining , you can see despair in John's eye . Madeleine deletes the despair in John . He became fully another person . Hitshcock make you feel the character change .At the end , Hitschock make you think about fear , you can see fear in Judy's eyes.Of course James Stewart played his part very great . What a great actor . Also Kim Novak plays two different character amazing . She play Madeleine excellent , but i liked Judy more .Great choices of Actors .Dont let green got you away !

Bohemian Rhapsody," Great Actor
","When the first Bohemian Rhapsody trailer appeared , i thought Rami isn't good choice for Freddie Mercury . When movie ends i understand i had a big mistake .
Rami played Freddie so great . About movie , It really feels like u are in the concert . The other Queen members played great , especially Brian May . Last 20 minutes of this movie was so dramatic . Great Job Bryan Singer ! Dont just stand right there get up and see this movie ! .",9,2,4,4 November 2018
