It," A King's masterpiece came to life
","I remember the time when I watched IT TV-series, somewhere in the 90s, back then, as a child, I was not so scared. There were some scary scenes but on the top, I didn't find Tim Curry's Pennywise scary. He was more of a clown than some evil entity.
But this one.... This one represents the pure masterpiece regardind the scares and the fact that it really creates that kind of 'childish scare atmosphere' and dives into our maybe long forgotten childish fears.
Andy Muschietti did an excellent job with this remake. The directing was beyond great. All the children are real professionals in this, beside that, they really were afraid while shooting some of the scenes.
And regarding the Pennywise character, Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd was the best choice for this role. He's young and athletic, he was able to execute some of the scenes without any CGI. His appearance, lip trick, his physicality and his 'lazy eye' brought so much into the character that can be seen and can be forgotten.Regarding the spoilers, I really don't know why making the fuss about it. Every King's fan had read the book and he knows what's gonna happen or at least they watched TV-series. It must be different because Andy and Bill are unique. But still it'll be the same story adaptation or remake.Thank you :)",10,0,1,1 June 2019
Good Will Hunting," A Pure Masterpiece for TEN
","A great story full of twists and turns, filled with lessons for a lifetime. This was and still is an extraordinary piece by Matt and Ben. Also from the screenwriting point , this one is one of a kind. So effectivelly written with its characters really show their feelings without telling it. Just best of the best.",10,1,2,4 March 2019
