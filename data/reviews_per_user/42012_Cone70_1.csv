Casablanca," Awensome movie
","So this is my favorite movie, first no-color movie. I read somewhere that most of dialogs in movie are improvised by main actors Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart. Very good acting and we can miss that, this movie won a Oscar. A lot of good music in the movie. Most of them are played by famous Sam (Dooley Wilson)a Rick(Humphrey Bogart) and Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) favorite piano player.Rick i a typical character played by Bogart. He's a a womanizer,funny, well-dressed guy who own a bar in Casablanca (Morocco. A lot of guys want a life like him.I watch this movie about 10 times, and always i get surprised by this masterpiece. Most of people can said that this is just overrated movie, but when you see how this movie is significant for industry of film. There is nobody how saw this movie and said to me that his expecting more from this, because there is no more this is the all that movie can give you. Replicas from this movie you can hear everywhere. From this sentence you can see that Casablanca is a MASTERPIECE",10,1,3,4 February 2015
