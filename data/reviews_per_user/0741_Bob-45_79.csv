Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Should have been the third movie
","Apparently, unlike most of you, my wife and I found 'Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows' to be dreary and uninvolving. Rachel McAdams ('Irene Adler') provides nothing more than a cameo; and Noomi Rapace (Madame Simza), who impressed so much in the 'Girl With The Dragon Tattoo' trilogy, is simply too remote and cool to provide much chemistry. The cliché gypsy fortune teller has flair; Rapace barely registers beyond her action sequences. Note to Naomi: Watch 'Golden Earings' with Marlene Dietrich to see how it is done. Speaking of action sequences, there are WAY too many in '...A Game of Shadows'. Action sequences require a tension build and there simply isn't any. Perhaps, worst, Jared Harris essays a bland Professor Moriarty. Then there is the story; little mystery, lots of noise and a climax that should really frustrate fans of 'Sherlock Holmes'. It is more appropriate to a third, fourth or even fifth movie.Memorable performances by Robert Downey, Jr., Jude Law and Stephen Fry ('Mycroft Holmes') plus top-not production values are all that saves this movie from being a total 'dog.' I give 'Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows' a weak '6'.",6,1,2,29 June 2012
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," You're No George Lucas!
","A friend of mine brought over his unopened collectors edition copy of  STAR WARS:  EPISODE 1, THE PHANTOM MENACE.  Unlike most people, I hadn't bothered to see the film in theaters.  Prequels are generally inferior (BUTCH AND SUNDANCE:  THE EARLY YEARS, INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM, etc.). Sadly, THE PHANTOM MENACE is no exception.  In fact, it is one of the most insipid knockoffs I've ever seen.  Even Roland Emmerich did it better with INDEPENDENCE DAY.  At least THAT movie had some genuinely striking visuals (the White House exploding comes immediately to mind). What's wrong with THE PHANTOM MENACE?  Let's start with the dialogue.  Much of it is unintelligible, EVEN AMONG THE HUMAN ACTORS.  That wouldn't be so bad if so much of the story wasn't dependent upon dialogue.  The pacing is flat-footed, at least during the first third.  The undersea ride is about as exciting, suspenseful and realistic as the submarine ride at Disneyworld. Unlike the originals, the entire film is shot at the 6th grade level. Even a good Disney movie has more pain. Unlike Darth Vader, Darth Maul has no personality, or even any dialogue. He's more like the typical Ninja in an Asian martial arts movie.  And, speaking of Asians, the movie also includes some ugly stereotyping.  The evil but stupid Viceroy and his aide have flat faces and noses and speak English with an obvious Asian accent. WARNING:  SPOILERS AHEAD. So Natalie Portman's played a `double.'  Wow, what a surprise.  Didn't this kind of plot element become old hat after THE PRINCE AND THE PAUPER? Certainly, it's been used by every soap opera on TV. Reducing Annakin's spiritual connection with `the Force' to simple physiological phenomena devalues the series' mysticism and begs a simple question.  Why not blood test EVERYBODY?  Annakin's penetration of the droid control ship was, quite simply, stupid, relying WAY too much on coincidence.  The pod race was so predictable I was half expecting to see Penelope Pitstop and Dick Dastardly among the contestants. Most surprisingly, the WORST thing about the movie were the effects.  I would have PREFERRED men in rubber masks and alien suits to the phony-looking CGI characters and scenery.  Want to see how it's done right? Witness the crowds watching the TITANIC depart, or the British Redcoats in THE PATRIOT.  Guess what?  Same effects firm (Lucas' Industrial Light & Magic).This is the worst sci-fi film I've seen since VIRUS (thankfully, I have so far avoided BATTLEFIELD EARTH).  Basics aside (cinematography, sound, etc.) THE PHANTOM MENACE fails on virtually every level.  All I can say to George Lucas is, `Sir, I knew George Lucas.  He was an innovative film maker who produced some clever, touching, humorous and exciting movies, and at least one genuine masterpiece (THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK).  George Lucas, you are no George Lucas.'",4,5,10,23 August 2000
Sucker Punch," Instant cult classic
","Love it or hate it (I happen to love it), 'Sucker Punch' sticks with you. Combination music video, violent video game and Freudian nightmare, this movie grabs and never lets go.The music and visual style of this movie alone is worth the price of the ticket. Superb ensemble acting (except maybe for 'Blondie,' played by Vanessa Hudgens), satisfying mystery, fantasy, action, tight editing, not a wasted frame of celluloid.'Baby Doll' is unjustly (or is she?) imprisoned in a mental institution in what appears to be the mid 60s. Here, she escapes her torment by indulging in fantasies (or alternate realities?) to discover her true powers and her purpose in life. A lot of critics (here and elsewhere) complained about the lack of character development. That would have proved excess baggage to a story of one person's story of self-realization (or, is it two?) While a flop in theaters, I expect 'Sucker Punch' to be one of those 'Midnight Movies,' along the line of 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show'.Mind blowing! I give 'Sucker Punch' a '10'.",Null,2,4,8 October 2011
Source Code," Mind Blowing
","Take a dash of 'The Matrix' and 'The 13th Floor,' add a smidgen of 'Sphere,' 'Donnie Darko' 'Frequency' and 'Paycheck' and, voila, you have 'Source Code'. Jake Gyllenhaal plays 'Colter Stevens,' an Army helicopter pilot whose last memories are flying sorties in Afghanistan, but suddenly finds himself in the body of a schoolteacher on board a double-decker commuter train speeding toward Chicago. Sitting opposite him is 'Christina Warren' (Michelle Monaghan), a friend the schoolteacher has known for a couple of months. Eight minutes pass with no significant incidents, when suddenly the train explodes, incinerating everyone on board. Colter Stevens then himself strapped inside a pod, his only outside communication a webcam connecting to Air Force Captain Colleen Goodwin (Vera Farmiga), who tells Colter the train was bombed earlier in the day by a terrorist and that, using his acute powers of observation, Colter must discover the identity of the bomber to prevent an even worse disaster. Colter not only takes on this mission for himself, he determines to discover the nature of what happened between his mission in Afghanistan and his current presence inside the pod.To reveal more would spoil the film. Let us just say it has a lot to do with the nature of 'reality' as it pertains to quantum physics and Jewish Khaballah, that moment-to-moment reality is determined by consciousness.This is a 'small' movie with big ideas. Like 'Groundhog Day,' Colter keeps relieving the same experiences, expanding the possible outcomes in order to accomplish his mission. Production values are superb and the small supporting cast is professional, bringing just the right nuances to thinly written characters to make them believable. Gyllenhaal and Monaghan have great chemistry, thankfully, as they have little time to establish their relationship, due to both the repetitive nature of their scenes and their time apart in order to produce the necessary variances in the 8 minute segments.Many, especially those bound in causality and linear thinking, will find themselves baffled by this movie, particularly the ending. No, this isn't really about 'parallel universes' or 'time travel,' it is about the nature of consciousness as it relates to quantum probabilities. All life is lessons and the 'reality' we see depends upon the lessons we need to learn. We truly are 'a thought in the mind of God' and our fate can be changed from instant to instant. That is the lesson of 'Source Code' and that lesson alone is worth a '10,' in my book, anyway.",10,1,4,10 July 2012
50 First Dates," Amazingly Good
","Take a little 'Memento,' Add a generous helping of 'Groundhog Day,' and even a little of 'Sommersby' and you have '50 First Dates'. Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler create a synergy that neither has been able to capture with anyone else. Together, they produce a romantic team comparable to Gere and Roberts, Day and Hudson, Grant and Loren and Tracy and Hepburn. My wife and I watch 'The Wedding Singer' at least once a year. While '50 First Dates' is a superior movie, I don't know if I can take the melancholy ending again.
For once I'm grateful for the Khamakazee antics of Sandler's acting ensemble, particulary Sean Astin and Rob Schneider.  If Schneider wasn't playing such a farcial role, he would be a natural for an Oscar. Certainly the animals add a lot to the farce. The goofy humor makes the basically tragic scenario not only bearable but almost pleasant. It's also genuinely funny.Sandler convincingly plays a marine biologist(!!!)in Hawaii who enjoys 'entertaining' the 'mainlanders.' Sandler doesn't date 'locals'. He wants nothing to interfere with his dream of studying walruses. He discovers Barrymore having breakfast in a local bar and grill. What captures Sandler's attention, even more than her beauty, is Barrymore's creativity. What Sandler doesn't know is that Barrymore has brain damage. The brain cells which move short term memory to long term storage are destroyed. She forgots everything she's learned during the day while she sleeps. So, Sandler, the lothario who forgots his relationships with mainlanders after one week finds himself in love with a woman who forgets hers in 24 hours. That's writing genius, something you don't see very often, and Sandler, Barrymore, and Sandler's acting troupe handle it perfectly.Though my wife is physically handicapped, my mother has severe short term memory loss. So, I really related to the trajedy so expertly portrayed in '50 First Dates'. It's not often I give a movie that leaves me this sad a '10'. The last time, I believe, was 'Sommersby'. Nonetheless, '50 First Dates' is a '10,' since there is nothing about it I can suggest that make it better. P.S. Looking forward to the NEXT Sandler/Barrymore collaboration.",10,142,169,25 June 2004
Erin Brockovich," Norma Rae's a Pretty Woman Playing Quincy
","WARNING: SPOILERS AHEADERIN BROCKOVICH is an overlong, routine star-turn for Julia Roberts. As Brockovich, Roberts shows the fashion sense of Cher, the vocabulary of Madonna (or Whoopi Goldberg), the sanctimony of Alan Alda, and the belligerence of Robert DeNiro (or Jack Klugman as QUINCY). A single mother with no education and trying to raise three children, Roberts/Brockovich struts around with a perpetual chip on her shoulder. To Roberts credit, she makes Brockovich understandable, though not overly likable (WAY too beligerant).  We also learn two heretofore undiscovered things about Roberts. She has a beauty mark (lovely spot, by the way), and she should NEVER again wear platform shoes.Brockovich intimidates herself into a job as a legal aide, and quickly uncovers a coverrup involving Pacific Gas & Electric, horribly polluted water, and people dieing of cancer; all the while, PG&E is consciously covering all this up.  During the course of her crusade, Brokovich succeeds in neglecting her children and driving away the only worthwhile man in her life. And what about the people made sick by PG&E.  They are portrayed and whiny and passive.  Hasn't anyone ever heard of a picket line?  NOTHING would get in and out of the gates of PG&E if it were MY family dying from their criminal activity.The movie reveals Brockovich received a $2,000,000 bonus for her work on this case.  Roberts received 20,000,000 to play her on screen. Couldn't these two great 'consumer advocates' get together with their Hollywood friends and petition both California and the Federal Government to CRIMINALIZE the kinds of activities committed by PG&E?  Aren't there laws against reckless endangerment and fraud?  Oh well, enjoy the movie.",6,0,2,19 March 2000
Unbreakable," Unfortunate
","I had high hopes for 'Unbreakable,' after M. Knight Shymalyan's terrific 'The Sixth Sense'.  Sadly, all the things that worked so well with 'The Sixth Sense' work against 'Unbreakable'. Shymalayan, the director seriously undercut Shymalayann, the writer, by eliminating a key scene (between a priest and Bruce Willis) which ties the film together better than anything else in its two plus tedious hours.  Willis plays David Duncan, the head of security at the ball park,who discovers, he is not only the ONLY survivor of a train derailment, he has not been hurt in any way.  He is contacted by Elijah Price (Samuel Jackson), a 'comic book art' collector, who tries to convince Willis that he and Willis are linked.  Elijah, you see, has a rare, serious bone deficiency, which results in his bones breaking easily; Elijah believes that Willis is super strong and nearly invulnerable, but doesn't know it.A BIG problem with the movie, is that the story shows only one character (Elijah) as a child.  Better if Elijay and David had been born in the same year, or even better, the same day.  Worse, it fails to provide any clues that any of the 'accidents' which have occured are anything more than 'accidents.'  Thus, the climactic 'payoff' is no 'payoff' at all. 
Much of the time this movie appears to be going no where. Willis' character is dull, his wife (Robin Wright Penn) is dull and drab (and also looks ten years older than she is), and Jackson's character is simply too strange to generate much sympathy.Shymalyan really blew this one.",4,0,1,30 June 2001
Memento," Pretty Good STUDENT Film
","I can't believe the number of people that have been taken in by 'Memento'. Sure, it's a clever idea to start a murder mystery at the end and work back to the beginning.  However, it's just as well that 'Memento' did it that way, because the story does NOT stand up to even average scrutiny.  Worse, it is played out in a sluggish manner, the conclusion of which would be obvious about 15 minutes before the denoument, had the film makers not resorted to cheating (Something a genuinely great film such as 'The Sixth Sense' never did.The always excellent Guy Pierce plays a former insurance investigator who is searching for the men who raped and killed his wife and left him with brain damage, leaving him incapable of creating new memories. This forces Pierce to take some drastic actions (including tatooing his body with important clues) in order to maintain enough coherency to pursue his quest.  He is aided(?) by a waitress (Carrie-Ann) Moss and a mystery man (Joe Palantiano).  As, I said, the story plays itself out in reverse.  That's a pretty easy task, even for a student film maker.  Just edit the story out of sequence.  Big deal!DEFINITE SPOILERS AHEAD1. The film relies on coincidence.  Joe Palantiano's character has the same initials as the rapist. 2. Joe Palantiano is an undercover cop.  Yet, he never tells Pierce after the first killing, even when he knows Pierce could kill him. Certainly, if he is hanging around for the money, he might try looking in the trunk of Pierce's car.  Pierce probably doesn't know it is there. 3. Pierce has false memories which deceive the audience. 4. Dodd, the 'big time' drug dealer comes alone, even though a HUGE amount of cash is involved.  By the way, just WHERE does a guy with no memory hide a huge stash of cash? 5. Dodd is easily subdued by Pierce. 6. Moss's characters actions are inconsistent. An interesting experiment, but rather sluggish and with unsympathetic characters.",6,2,4,2 June 2001
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Sinks in its Own Contradictions
","A BRIEF SUMMARY: Elizabeth Swann, the daughter of the new island governor, is traveling by ship with her father to their new home. The come upon a ship, ransacked and burned by pirates. Suddenly, Elizabeth spots an unconscious boy, Will Turner, in the water. When Will is brought onto the ship and laid upon the deck, Elizabeth spots a gold medallion around his neck. Fearing the authorities will arrest the boy as a pirate, Elizabeth steals the medallion. Years later, when Will and Elizabeth grow up, they share an adventure involving the medallion, an unearthly pirate crew and `the curse of the Black Pearl'. `All opinions are vanity ' including my own. Well, I guess I better prepare myself to be clobbered once again for trashing a movie `everybody loves'. `Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl' is most illogical movie I've seen since `Lost in Space'.  `Lost in Space' at least had three shapely women in body-hugging space suits. PCCBP has Johnny Depp. Johnny has turned in some really good performances (`Edward Scissorhands,' `Ed Wood,' `Sleepy Hollow,' and, especially, `Don Juan DeMarco') but his loose, effete `Jack Sparrow' is more `Captain Morgan' than Captain Kidd. That is, the rum is doing most of the acting. WARNING: SPOILERS Well, let's see, all the crew of the Black Pearl except Jack Sparrow, BUT INCLUDING WILL'S FATHER, have been cursed for stealing Aztec gold. As part of their curse, food turns to ashes; and, while they cannot die, in the moonlight they are clearly rotting corpses. HELLO!  If they cannot die, HOW COULD THEY KILL WILL'S FATHER? If they are really rotten corpses, WHY DIDN'T THEY DIE AS SOON AS THE CURSE WAS LIFTED? I can understand why Will wasn't cursed, BUT WHY WASN'T ELIZABETH? Oh, because she did it to save Will, THEN WHY WAS JACK SPARROW CURSED? Oh, because he was Captain of the Black Pearl; DO YOU REALLY THINK A CURSE WOULD BE SO SELECTIVE? I can understand why the Black Pearl crew became rotting corpses when they were cursed. They spent a period of time suffering from starvation and thirst, but WHY DID JACK IMMEDIATELY BECOME A ROTTING CORPSE? Oh yes, I've heard, `Forget the logic and enjoy the fun.' How much fun is there in an adventure movie where the only mortals you care about are so central to the plot you KNOW they cannot be killed? I enjoyed the production values, the music and the performances, but I never forgot this is a BAD pirate movie. If you really want to have fun watching a good pirate movie, see `The Crimson Pirate' or `Swashbuckler.' If you insist on seeing a bad pirate movie, see `Cutthroat Island'. At least it makes sense.",4,1,2,3 February 2004
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Contrived, but surprisingly believable.
","Looking at all the plot contrivances in 'Crazy, Stupid Love,' I can't believe I found this movie so engaging and believably. I don't much care for Steve Carell, nor did I find his character very likable or sympathetic. Julianne Moore, while a fine actress, is not one of my favorites, either. However, the ensemble cast is good, especially Ryan Gosling, Emma Stone, Analeigh Tipton, Jonah Bobo and, in an incredibly thankless role, Marisa Tomei, that I found myself carried along by this broad, sometimes farcical story.Writer Dan Fogelman's screen is so eccentric, it drew me away from obvious conclusions with snappy dialogue and directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa make no mistakes, as even one would have caused 'Crazy, Stupid Love' to come crashing down.Some don't understand WHY Julianne Moore cheated and HOW Steve Carell changed. The answer is that Steve Carell took his life for granted and never developed his innate romantic skills. He had to discover his dark side before finding out WHO he really is. He reveals this in his climactic speech.While production values are top-notch, they are also suitably forgettable. The important thing for me is I watched the closing credits with a smile on my face, new found admiration for Emma Stone and Marisa Tomei and discovered what a fine comedic actor Ryan Gosling can be.",7,1,2,10 December 2011
Ted," Frequently hilarious and touching; one of the all time great comedies
","Seth MacFarlane's irreverent humor may not be for everybody; but those who love 'The Family Guy' will adore 'Ted,' whose running time equals about five 'Family Guy' segments,yet, amazingly, maintains a more consistent level of humor than even one average episode. 'Ted' even trumps 'Family Guy' by also being a romantic comedy superior to most. A pretty amazing accomplishment,if you ask me; and, I hope the Motion Picture Academy recognizes this by nominating 'Ted' as one of the year's best films.I have always considered Mark Wahlberg a middling actor with great taste in scripts, as he has made some really fine movies. Mila Kunis is not only beautiful, but a great 'straight man,' as the antics in 'Ted' would have rattled any lessor actress. Giovanni Ribisi is terrific in a small role, saving what is easily the weakest part of the movie (which is still better than your average movie). However, who would've thought Sam Jones(!) would steal every scene in which he appears? NOTE TO Hollywood: Give this guy another chance.Ted's animation is so astounding you actually come to accept him as a living, breathing creature, and the fantasy sequence recreation of 'Flash Gordon' is spot on, an more amazing accomplishment considering the film's relatively small budget. Likewise, kudos to whoever effected the 'appearance with Johnny Carson'.As a bonus, Nora Jones, one of my favorite singers, also appears; and, she proves she is not only a great singer, she is sexy-beautiful and funny.'Ted' stands along with 'Duck Soup,' 'Young Frankenstein' and 'The Whole Nine Yards' as my all time favorite comedies.I give 'Ted' a '10'.",10,8,18,8 January 2013
Spider-Man 2," Soars Above the Rest
","Since 'Superman' (1978) became the first 'A' picture based on comic book characters, numerous comic book superheroes has appeared on the big screen, most notably 'Batman,' 'XMen,' 'Hellboy' and 'Spiderman.' However, until now, the comic book franchises have always suffered slightly from the melodramatic limitations of their origins. As one who did not like the original 'Spiderman' film, I was pleasantly surprised to find 'Spiderman 2' is not only superior to the first movie, 'Spiderman 2' transcends the genre. Well written and acted, with Oscar-caliber special effects, in a less competitive year 'Spiderman 2' would have been a Best Picture nominee. My only quibble is the lack of clarity for the plot references to the first movie. This quibble aside, 'Spiderman 2' is an exciting, poignant, romantic movie with fully realized characters and satisfying ending. I give 'Spiderman 2' a '9.'",9,1,2,2 February 2005
The Fifth Element," Try it, you'll like it.
","The most witty, colorful and original sci-fi film of the 1990s, THE FIFTH ELEMENT literally paints the landscape with vivid colors, costume design art directon, music, several wonderful over-the-top performances (most notably Chris Tucker and Gary Oldman).  Only in the the romance element is the film a little weak.  There really isn't much chemistry between Bruce Willis and Mila Jovavich.  However, they are attractive and appealing. The images from this film linger long after it ends, even if the plot does not.  Excellent direction and film editing. Try it, you'll like it.",9,0,1,27 August 2000
L.A. Confidential," Confidentially: Could have been MUCH Better
","Watching L. A. CONFIDENTIAL at home, about a third of the way through the movie, I turned to my sister (a MAJOR Russell Crowe fan) and said, if this movie maintains the quality it has so far, I'll have to eat my words and admit it should have won best picture.  Heck, had it maintained the quality and momentum, it would have been the best picture of the DECADE.  However, the last third of the movie degenerates into succession ofcontrivances and coincidences, and climaxes with one of the silliest shootouts in movie history. However, I'd rather talk about the pluses of this film. This is quite simply the GREATEST recreation of an era I've everseen.  From production design to set decoration to costume design to makeup, this movie is perfect.  It's all topped off like a cherry on top with absolutely beautiful cinematography (some of the best I've ever seen) Those elements alone make TITANIC's seem like cheap artifices by comparison.  I livedthrough those years and this simply WAS the fifties.  My only quibble (and one representative of the entire movie; that is, soft around the edges)is that NOBODY smokes.  Excuse me...this is the fifties, EVERYBODY smoked.  The character Ed Exley isthe best written, most complex character I've ever seen in ANY form of fiction, and Guy Pearce (quite possibly our best living actor) captures every nuance of this complex man.  Russell Crowe is terrific, alternately frightening and lovable).  Kevin Spacey is, well, Kevin Spacey...a sly cross between Humphrey Bogart and Gene Hackman, with charm to burn.  Kim Basinger is radiant; she's never looked more beautiful or desirable.  Sadly, she's underused, and doesn't have enough scenes to create new sides to the cliche 'whore with a heart of gold.'  Late in the film, when she 'seduces' Guy Pearce, she has all the 'jiggles' right (NOBODY, not even Liz Taylor or Monroe looked THAT good in those 50s dresses), but isn't allowed the sluttiness to convince us the seduction is genuine (Kim, I know you won the Oscar; but you should really watch Michelle Pfeiffer in WOLF or WHAT LIES BENEATH to see how it's done).  The scene seems weak and hollow and undercuts her otherwise fine performance. The is certainly the BEST ensemble acting of 1997.  The only false note here is Danny DeVito (see, that softness around the edges again) once again playing Louie DePalma, this time moonlighting as the editor/publisher of HUSH HUSH (the thinly disguised CONFIDENTIAL magazine).  What this part needed was the oiliness of Jay Mohr (JERRY MCGUIRE) Terry Kyser (WEEKEND AT BERNIES) or even David Strathairn (who plays Pierce Patchett).  In other words, better olive oil than lard...If you want a better constructed, less convoluted and better paced movie about police corruption, see THE BIG EASY. However, if you want to enjoy a sumptuousness feast of artistry, Kim Basinger's almost majestic beauty, Guy Pearce's and Russell Crowe's incredible performances, see L.A. CONFIDENTIAL. You'll have a REALLY good time.",8,0,0,23 July 2000
The Day After Tomorrow," Is This Some Kind of Bad Joke?
","Great special effects, sound and editing can't make up for stupidity in writing. 'The Day After Tomorrow' takes a fine hypothesis and runs it into the ground with unbelievably trite storytelling. CAN 'Global Warming' usher in a new Ice Age? Maybe, but this movie leaves WAY too many questions unanswered, while violating some basic realities. For example, 'Global Warming' caused by the excessive use of fossil fuels makes sense as presented. However, climatologists have been telling us since the 60s that we are overdue for another Ice age. Dennis Quaid's scientist tells us we have to look back 10,000 years for previous climate history. WHO was burning excessive amounts of fossil fuel then, 'Atlantis'? I'm OK with that, but the movie never says so. WARNING: SPOILERS 'The Day After Tomorrow' REALLY lost me in the second half, when Quaid travels to New York City to rescue his son. Let's see, he walks from north of Philadelphia to NYC, a distance of over 150 miles. How long does it take? The movie gives us the impression he does this in a couple of days(!!!) Initially, there were roughly 30 people held up in the New York City Public Library. They stayed until the ice froze 100 FEET from the city street. How long would that take, even under these conditions? Days? Weeks? No problem that 30 people have virtually no food, no drinking water and no sanitary conditions. After they leave, it still would have taken Quaid a month or more to walk to NYC. Yet, the movie would have us believe ten people could survive this long with a few tins of food and junk food. It also asks us to believe the 'girl genius' would ignore a potentially fatal cut instead of asking the librarian for a first aid kit.My favorite stupidity was the belief that Mexico and Central American countries would allow close to 100 MILLION Americans into their country in exchange for 'debt forgiveness'! Come on, WHO would be alive to collect those debts anyway. I could certainly believe the President would order National Guard and Army regulars to invade Mexico under the circumstances. Now THAT would have made for an interesting story.I hate to give a movie as well-made as 'The Day After Tomorrow' a '4,' but that is CERTAINLY as much as it deserves, given the plot stupidities. However, if you enjoyed 'Independence Day,' an even STUPIDER movie, you'll probably enjoy 'The Day After Tomorrow.' Which reminds, me, the Emmerich Brothers gave us a 'heroic' Hillary Clinton in ID, but we have a stupid Dick Cheney in this one. Quick, what did Clinton-Gore do for reducing the consumption of fossil fuels? FACT: Corporate Average Fuel Consumption has been rising since REAGAN, thanks primarily to our love affairs with SUVs.",4,2,5,17 October 2004
Cloverfield," WARNING: May Induce Post Traumatic Stress
","What brought me to 'Cloverfield,' was not that it was an over-hyped, star-studded extravaganza, with a compelling storyline. Quite the contrary, 'Cloverfield' is none of those things. What brought me to 'Cloverfield' was the most compelling TV trailer I'd seen since 'A Fistful of Dollars,' over 40 years ago.While watching 'Cloverfield,' I thought, 'While always clever, the first 20 minutes are almost tedious; and what follows is not particularly suspenseful or scary.' I needn't share these thoughts with my wife, as she hated 'Cloverfield,' without my help. THEN I had the first movie-induced nightmare I'd experienced in 50 years. I now understand the real power of 'Cloverfield'. Part 'Blair Witch,' part 'Spielberg's War of the Worlds,' part 'X-files,' part generic teen movie, 'Cloverfield' is also a whole lot more. 'Cloverfield' is the closest replication of a nightmare I've ever experienced. Time and spatial elements are cleverly distorted. Sound effects elements are muffled. While the gore is convincingly explicit, it's not exploited, and much of the violence is suggested. The emotions I experienced must be a lot like those radio listeners felt while listening to the infamous Mercury Theater 'War of the Worlds' broadcast. It was the spatial anomalies, however, that disturbed me the most. While the creature was impossibly enormous, it was also unbelievably flexible, apparently capable of extending itself several times its actual size. Aren't fears, at first, suggested, then 'in your face,' the stuff of nightmares? Aren't darkness and confusion, 'the stuff,' as well? 'Cloverfield' has all of these. Further, the monster's progeny, spider-like creatures the size of hogs, create the more immediate threat, and the fear of 'What's moving on the ceiling of my bedroom?' Kudos to the entire cast for making such 'ordinary' characters memorable. Even more kudos to the production team of 'Cloverfield' for doing what I always thought was impossible, i.e. the perfect recreation of the nightmare experience.I caution anyone who either directly experienced or lost loved ones on 911 that this movie could induce unbearable post traumatic stress. Certainly, 'Cloverfield' and its resultant nightmare will haunt me for many years to come. I can state, without a doubt, 'Cloverfield' is the most provocative science fiction film since 'The Matrix' and may well be the best science fiction / fantasy film ever made. It's also likely to be one of the ten best genre films of the decade. I give 'Cloverfield' a '10'.",10,0,3,2 June 2008
Sleepy Hollow," Great Coming of Age Movie for Christina Ricci
","SLEEPY Hollow is bloody, very exciting and sometimes scary retelling of Washington Irving's classic short story THE LEGEND OF SLEEPY HOLLOW.  People are dieing in the small village of Sleepy Hollow, and New York City Detective Icabod Crane (Johnny Depp) is directed by a city judge (Christopher Lee) to investigate.  All the victims have died in the same manner; their heads have been severed by one blow of a broadsword. Legend has it the wielder of that sword is 'The Headless Horseman,' a 'walking undead' (well, riding, anyway) apparition of a dead Hessian (Christopher Walken, satisfyingly goulish) Visiting the village, Depp begins to uncover the sinister secrets of the village, as well as his own deeply-hidden past. He falls in love with the daughter of the richest man in the village (Christina Ricci) and finds himself the target of her jealous suitor (Casper Von Dien).  As Depp delves closer to the truth, he must not only face the horseman, but his own fearsand cynicism. This is a great coming of age movie for Christina Ricci.  Her character is definitely a woman, not just a sexpot, like most of her recent outings. Miranda Richardson plays her stepmother, and I've loved her since she played the evil queen Maub in MERLIN.  The best performances are Ricci, Johnny Depp and (surprisingly) Casper Von Dien.  The story is way too convoluted.  I never did completely put all of it together.  And the culprit is surpisingly easy to spot.  Still, the film is exciting and has great atmosphere.  The cinematography is perfect, cold, brittle, gloomy where it needs to be.

Snatch," Huh?
","'Snatch'...what a perfect title for a movie made by a guy married to Madonna...maybe someday he will cofeature it with Amanda Peet's 'Whipped'.Not to say there is not a lot to like in 'Snatch,' at least the colorful characters, flashy editing and great sight gags.  I even found the dialogue witty, once I turned on the close captioning, so I could understand it. The best (and truest) line in the movie comes from Dennis Farina ('For a country that spawned the English language, you think somebody'd be able to speak it.'  The BEST English comes from the three blackand quite luckless thugs.  Is there a message here?  To complicate things even more, Brad Pitt, playing a gypsy, speaks a language even the Limeys don't understand.Perhaps it is just as well writer / director Guy Ritchie made 'Snatch' verbally incomprehensible.  Certainly, there isn't too much to the story, which opens with a diamond heist and involves a predictable series of misadventures which follow.If you have a DVD player, be sure to rent the DVD; it has a very funny deleted scene involving Benecio Del Toro (Frankie Four Fingers). It also has subtitles in the madeup language Brad Pitt uses in the movie.This movie would have been big disappointment without close captioning. As it is, it is a funny, is somewhat predictable, and surprisingly violent caper film.",6,0,2,23 July 2001
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," THE APOCALYPSE ACCORDING TO DILBERT
","When I saw DR. STRANGELOVE as a high school student, I thought it was silly, childish, and unbelievable.  Now, after 30 plus years of working in the military-industrial complex, I think it's a documentary (or, at least, a docu-drama).Though I believe Kubrick is generally overrated, he was in top form with this movie.  By telling a serious story, but populating it with childish elements (gibberish names, bad puns, a Bob Newhart-like 'red phone' call to the Soviet Premier), Kubrick assembled a film which delivers a far greater message than the sum of its parts.  Certainly, the cinematography and editing (particularly on board the B-52) is par excellance, right up there with CITIZEN KANE (or any Sergio Leone movie, for that matter).  In the B-52 scenes, Kubrick even had the camera set to realistically shake, simulating aircraft movement. (By the way, did anyone else spot James Earl Jones as one of the crewmembers?)The White House's refusal to accept a collect phone call from a SAC base under siege, the former NAZI national security (and science advisor), the Air Force General whom views the start of World War III as a blaze of 'glory' all are well grounded in similar, if not actual, events.  One of of former NASA Apollo program scientists was deported for being a former NAZI (after he was no longer useful, I presume). During Granada, a Marine had to use his own telephone credit card and a pay phone to call in an air strike, because the different services were using different radio frequencies!  The first Commander of SAC, as a Vice Presidential Candidate suggested we bomb North Vietnam 'into the Stone Age.' Finally, can't anyone imagine a President Steve Forbes using almost the same words and manners if HE had to call the Kremlin in a similar situation? Remember George Bush and 'Deep doo-doo?What is true about DILBERT is equally true about DR. STRANGELOVE:  the truly scary part is that every joke, no matter how absurd, seems plausible.",Null,1,2,28 July 1999
Pacific Rim," Third rate screenplay, first rate production
","When I first saw the trailer for 'Pacific Rim,' I said to myself 'Rock'em, Sock'em Robots'. I mean, the idiot-level concept that the gigantic monsters would not be stopped by torpedoes, missiles or guns at sea or a submarine net rigged with explosives or electricity just seemed to stupid to endure. However, two things made me change my mind: 1) my wife wanted to see it and 2) the movie had a really beautiful 'look' (thanks to topnotch production values and use of a RED camera (the same camera used for 'Step-up Revolution). Minutes into the movie, my other suspicions were confirmed: 1) this movie is marketed to an international cast, as the the three main characters are all of different races and nationalities; and 2) the storyline would be one cliché after another.Nonetheless, I rate 'Pacific Rim' highly for the acting, direction, music and those aforementioned production values. Even the cliché plot lines seem fresh and original due to the fine acting; especially Idris Elba, who could impress reading a soup can. Also, always welcome, is Ron Perlman, who somehow always manages to class up the most ridiculous projects.With a cast of real actors, not stars, the most modest of romances and lots of violent action, this movie screams 'International (particularly Asian) project'. I certainly expected to see more Asian names among the technical credits. However, when one figures three-fourths of this movies grosses came from outside the US, it is clear Guillermo del Toro intended to make an international film, and he certainly made a handsome one. I give 'Pacific Rim' a '7'.",7,1,5,5 June 2014
American Sniper," Boring, episodic movie
","Unlike many reviewers (most of them paid film critics), I will try to separate my personal animosity to US policies in the Middle East from my measure of the artistic merit of 'American Sniper'.My wife insisted on us watching 'American Sniper,' then lost interest in the first hour. Most of the truly engaging, emotional scenes are revealed in the trailers. What comes in between those engaging moments are detached episodes chronicling Chris Kyle's tours in Iraq. I admire Kyle for his personal code. However, I did not admire Kyle's inability to question the policies of those under whom he served, even when director Clint Eastwood slyly presents evidence to motivate Kyle to do so. What Eastwood does fail to do is provide a subtle transition from extroverted 'good old boy' to extreme introvert; whom, in his wife's words, is 'not here'. However, I doubt any director could have done so, given the absence of such scenes in the screenplay.This being said, while Sienna Miller is very good, Bradley Cooper, as 'Chris Kyle' is nothing short of extraordinary. I cannot imagine another acted who could have done it better.Without revealing the end of the movie (which is ridiculous, given it is 'old news'), let me say it is perfectly appropriate. Chris Kyle paid the appropriate price for using his skills to help the wrong people.I give 'American Sniper' a '6'.",6,2,7,5 July 2015
Rush," Precision craftsmanship
","When my wife and I first saw the US trailer for 'Rush,' my wife asked me, 'Do you want to see it?' 'Well, it IS a 'racing movie,' I replied. I have mixed emotions about NOT watching the international trailer, before watching 'Rush,' because I would certainly have held much higher expectations. First and foremost, 'Rush' is NOT about Chris Hemsworth's pecs; nor, for that matter, is it that much about about Chris Hemworth's character, James Hunt. 'Rush' is about two extraordinary men's visions of life and their approaches to racing; and, it is viewed from James Hunt's most famous challenger, Nicki Lauder. Lauder is a technocrat; a man who, at least, appears to 'know the price of everything and the value of nothing.' Hunt is free spirit; one of simultaneously knows the value of everything and nothing. Hunt and Lauder are presented in much the same manner as the two main characters of 'Lonesome Dove'. Like, 'Lonesome Dove,' 'Rush' is majestic in its presentation of these two lives. 'Rush' is poetic in its presentation, absolute precision,from its score, to its cinematography, to its performances to the most both memorable and appropriate score I have heard since 'The Good, The Bad & The Ugly'.If you have not seen 'Rush,' watch the international trailer, available on YouTube. This trailer is the perfect encapsulation of the movie. If you still are not interested, don't bother. However, I hope you are as impressed as I with my favorite film of 2013.",10,6,7,16 February 2014
Léon: The Professional," The Assassin Next Door Makes for a Great Movie
","This review is for the International (Director's Cut) of the movie. I gave the US version, 'The Professional' a '7'. The additional scenes in 'Leon' masterfly flesh out the movie. This is now the most intimate and beautiful action/adventure film I've ever seen.This film opens simply, with 'contract negotiations' between an Italian mobster and a hit-man. However, this scene plays right out of a Sergio Leone western. Complete with extreme closeups, clipped dialogue, and quick cuts, the movie grabs us from the opening frame. Following the 'contract,' the hit-man dispatches roughly a half-dozen baddies in fast-paced and clever fashion. One the 'hit' is accomplished, we meet the hit-man, the sad-eyed laconic Leon. Leon doesn't live; he exists. He's not cold, just 'dead' of any feelings but melancholy. Into his life comes Matilda (Natalie Portman), a beautiful twelve year-old, far too worldly for her years. Matilda, like most girls her age isa child-woman whom has seen and experienced far too much, yet has maintained spiritual innocence, even if her body has been violated and abused. CAUTION: SPOILERS AHEAD. When Matilda family is murdered by the hopped-up, psychotic Stansfield, she turns to Leon for help. Leon discovers emotions he has forgotten. Leon remembers how to love unselfishly. The two most beautiful scenes in the film are between Matilda and Leon. In the first Matilda pleads with Leon to let her in after the murder of her family. In the second, Matilda, negotiates with Leon, offering to serve him in exchange for his protection and to help him avenge the death of her little brother. Portman is masterful in expressing the anguish of a young woman will to use any means (including, reluctantly, her body) to get what she needs. One can almost forgive Portman for her present blatant hypocrisy on the gun issue, given the amount of firepower she associates herself with here, as this is the finest performance by a young actress I've seen. 'Leon' unspokenly asks you to reexamine your values. I loved Leon and Matilda despite Leon's trade and Matilda's bloodthirsty desire vengeance. The added footage in the international version solidifies the bond between Leon and Matilda, and, vicariously the audience. The ending, thus because as poignant as it is exciting.I've never seen another action film quite like 'Leon,' and I know I've never loved a movie more. Think of 'Leaving Las Vegas' meets 'Die Hard.' I give 'Leon' a '10'.",10,0,2,1 May 2000
The Bourne Identity," Matt Damon Rocks! (I CANNOT BELIEVE I AM SAYING THIS)
","`The Bourne Identity' is a superb spy film. Gritty, realistic, suspenseful and surprisingly action-packed. `Bourne' is the kind of spy movie a Bond movie should be, but never is, at least in its entirety. Nearly as convoluted as `Spy Game,' (another great spy film) `Bourne' surpasses it, managing to remain both coherent AND interesting throughout. Lushly photographed,terrifically photographed and choreographed, superbly acted and beautifully scored, `Bourne' is a BIG success, in no small part, to Matt Damon.  Damon is incredibly convincing as an emotional automaton, who one minute oozes schoolboy looks and personal humanity, while in the next effortlessly kills or disables scores of adversaries.  During one such dispatching, Damon utilizes the most incredible stunt I've ever seen, and makes us believe he could do it. The only improvement I could see could have been made to `Bourne' would be a little more explanation regarding the `Treadstone' programming.  What little explanation is provided gets lost in the action and suspense.  Otherwise, this movie is darn near perfect.I can hardly wait to see Damon reprise this role. I just wonder what producers Kennedy/Marshall and director Doug Liman could do to match, much less top this. I hope IMDB members who read my review enjoy this movie as much as I did.",10,2,2,21 July 2003
The Matrix Revolutions," The Action Blows You Away, the Ending Just Blows
","WARNING: SPOILERSThe third and least of the MATRIX movies reduces Morpheus to a bit player and likely kills off Trinity and Neo. Guess I was wrong on part of the religious allegory, but I thought the POINT of 'Reloaded' was that Neo had his powers in BOTH realities.  He was the Messiah, the 'promised one' of Judaism, Christianity AND Islam (probably others as well). He was battling the 'antiChrist,' Smith, who had broken through the Matrix and could steal souls. Instead, we're left with 'the Oracle' (God?) and 'the architect' (Satan?) on EQUAL levels and 'Love,' (personified as a beautiful child) awaiting the eventual return of Neo. It all seemed pretty pointless; as, alas, does life, sometimes.I HAD hoped Neo would confront the architect, disable the matrix and awaken those who were 'sleeping.' THAT would have eliminated Smith and disabled the machines. Instead, Neo makes a bargain with the 'collective conscious' of the machines in order to defeat Smith, who threatened to destroy them all. NONSENSE! Smith NEVER showed contempt for the machines.  Besides, Smith was intelligent software that had developed a foolproof method to keep the 'awake' from penetrating the matrix. If they did, Smith could capture their souls. The machines should have LOVED permanently perpetuating the matrix, even if they 'feared' Smith was becoming TOO powerful.The final confrontation with Smith reminded me of the climax to 'Scanners.' In this connotation, that seems a bit silly.IF Neo WAS the messiah, what was the need for the LOVE software?We are left with an ending in which there was no longer a need for a matrix at all, since 'the architect' promised to release the 'sleepers. Since such a conclusion would likely mean the end of the machines, WHY would they EVER agree to it.Great action but the ending blows.I give THE MATRIX: REVOLUTIONS a '5'.",5,0,0,25 April 2004
Man of Steel," Hollywood remakes 'First Knight'?
","The Superman character was only 20 years old when I first began reading the DC comics. Superman and Green Lantern were my favorite DC characters, as Green Arrow and Batman had too similar origins and partners, Speedy and Robin, respectively. Marvel Comics were not even carried on any of the news stands I frequented. While I later became more found of characters who relied on their skills rather than super powers, I certainly read more Superman, as he appeared in both the Superman and Detective Story comic books. I had never been really satisfied with the movie versions of Superman; it always seemed to me they chose the wrong actresses to play Lois Lane. Both Noel Nell ('Adventures of Superman') and Terri Hatcher ('Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman') resembled the comic book Lois Lane, both in appearance and class. However, until 'Man of Steel,' I had never seen a such a hash of the Superman legend. Even as a kid, I understood that Kal-El embodied BOTH Clark Kent AND Superman; and that Lois, while a fearless, crusading reporter, was so vain and self deceptive that she could not recognize that Clark and Superman were one in the same; as she was unable to accept both sides of Kal-El. Kal-El loved Lois, despite this tragic character trait. The widely-despised 'Superman III' actually makes a point of this; in that Lana Lang loved Clark Kent and could not care less that he was Superman. However, in 'Man of Steel,' Lois is ONLY non-family member who knows Clark Kent is Superman. The entire theme of 'the inner man' has been tragically shelved.Henry Cavill does a fine job of playing Kal-El, even if he less resembles the comic book Superman than Christopher Reeve, Dean Cain or George Reeves. Clearly Cavill has a great future in Hollywood. Amy Adams, an otherwise superb actress ('American Hustle') is totally wrong for Lois Lane. Not meaning to be unkind, I asked myself, 'Just how does one actually go about kissing a woman with such a LONG nose'. As written, NONE of Lois' trademark characteristics are visible in Adams' role.Russell Crowe seems to have as much screen time as Cavill. Whose movie is this, Jor-El's or Kal-El's? In the original comics, the Kents were an ELDERLY couple. Here, they appear to be in their mid to late 40s.While the effects and production design are handsomely mounted, there is nothing new here to rave about. Worse, the movie is numbingly long. Superman does not even appear in costume until nearly two hours into the movie. Say what you want about any of the Christopher Reeve efforts; they were never boring or ponderous. 'Man of Steel is both.'First Knight' was rightfully savaged in 1995 when it created a travesty of the King Arthur legend. 'Man of Steel' gets kudos. Has our cultured declined THAT much in the last 20 years?I give 'Man of Steel' a '4'.",4,3,6,23 May 2014
The Thing," Classic Horror/SciFi; Just Wish They Kept Campbell's Ending
","It's impossible for me to discuss John Carpenter's 'The Thing' without also discussing several works that provided its inspiration. J.w. Campbell's classic story 'Who Goes There' was also the inspiration for the Howard Hawks/Christian Nyby version in 1950. Since Hawks/Nyby lacked the technology to portray Campbell's shape-shifting, assimilating creature, they focus on Campbell's theme of the 'red scare'. It's absolutely true communists occupied high positions in our government, including the CIA at the time Campbell wrote 'Who Goes There'. Hawks/Nyby focused on the camaraderie of the artic crew to represent 'the American way of life,' while making the creature a 'walking vegetable,' feeding on blood and preparing its occupation of the earth through asexual reproduction. Thus, the creature represented the 'Communist menace' and the scientist a 'fellow traveler. By 1955, the US government, through oppressive laws against communist in this nation, as well as the Hollywood Blacklist,had created a backlash against 'McCarthyism'. As a result, 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' presented the humans as communists and the 'pod people' as the 'fascist oppressors'. Also, in 1955, the UK released 'The Quatermass Experiment,' AKA 'The Creeping Unknown,' which presented a creature that possessed the assimilation half of Campbell's 'Thing'. By the time of the unsuccessful release of John Carpenter's film, the 'red scare' portion had been utterly discarded. However, the paranoic theme of 'do you ever really 'know' somebody?' essence of Campbell's story remained. Even better, 'movie magic' technology had made it possible to represent the creature as Campbell presented him: a communal shape-shifter capable of masking his actual identities, but capable of viciously revealing it true multiple natures when threatened or 'hungry'. Carpenter wisely retained most of Campbell's story. Especially effective is the scene where each of the Antarctic station's crew member is tested by having a hot wire submerged in his blood. It's a pity Carpenter didn't retain Campbell's ending, which was to discover that the creature was using equipment parts to build a communicator to alert his kind that the earth was ripe for invasion. Carpenter's ending is not as plausible, but it is certainly more exciting.The television version of the movie adds narrative exposition, providing the background of each character. I believe that was improvement over the initial movie release. After all, the characters start dying off so quickly, it's difficult to identify them, much less develop some empathy. Nonetheless, 'John Carpenter's The Thing' is taut and terrifying, a genuine classic that did not deserve it's box office failure. Kurt Russell, Keith David, Richard Dysart, Wilford Brimley and the rest of the cast turn in fine performances. Ennio Morricone's terrific music perfectly complements the dark, moody cinematography and editing. The creature effects are outstanding and quite gruesome. Only the short animation sequence lacks plausibility.'John Carpenter's The Thing' has finally become a bonafide classic, and that's a good thing (pardon the pun). I give it an '8'.",8,0,1,10 September 2004
Armageddon," Whatsammatta, are we all a little 'cranky'?
","When I saw ARMAGEDDON in theatres, I thought, 'This is cool; I've never seen a 144 minute movie trailer before.'  I thought the movie was loud, fast, and, at worst, sometimes indecipherable.  Boy, was I unprepared for the storm of criticism that followed the movie.  'Unscientific?'  This from people that consider STAR WARS a science fiction masterpiece? Give me a break.  For starters, the WORST science elements of ARMAGEDDON are scientifically more accurate than any of the STAR WARS or STAR TREK films (if not the series).  If you don't believe that, pick up the CRITERION COLLECTION DVD (as I did) and listen to the scientific commentary from the NASA science advisor.  You will also find the 153 minute director's cut MUCH easier to follow (particularly during the space sequences).  Unrealistic characters?  Man, I've MET people like virtually all the characters in this movie; particularly the science geek and full time leech played by Steve Buscemi.  In fact, for a few years, I WAS that guy!  To me, this movie is a real rush. I'm sorry for you that don't 'get it.'  But, crimany, be fair, and just don't parrot the sophomoric inaccuracies of 'mainstream movie' critics whom make a living dumping on eagerly-anticipated movies. Guys who say, 'There ARE NO 'Texas-size' asteroids', for example.  The NASA science advisor for this movie says that, not only ARE there 'Texas-size' asteroids, but SEVERAL have hit the earth throughout our history.  I never took the line all that literally in the movie, anyway.  I just figured that was Billy Bob Thornton's way of simplifying things for a simpleminded Texas governor whom was probably by now president.  After all, does anyone believe, ONE thermonuclear device the size of the one shown in the movie would disperse THAT much rock? LIGHTEN UP, People!

"I, Robot"," Robot Dog

I hate summarizing a movie plot, but when there is so little to say, good or otherwise, about the trite, predictable, 'I Robot,' I need the summary to meet the required number of lines for submission.Will Smith's performance as the cop is slack and listless, the worse star turn since Eddie Murphy in 'Beverly Hills Cop 3' (I can't count Kevin Coaster). The art direction is as phony and unconvincing as the sets in 'Never Say Never Again'. The Oscar-nominated(!) robot special effects are not done nearly as well as in the mostly forgotten 'Red Planet.' Sure, Sonny is incredibly charming, but so what? The action set pieces never rise above the level of video game and the tunnel sequence doesn't have enough high level (i.e., Long Shot) coverage to be even that good.The plot is not only trite and predictable, it is in one key plot element (gasp!) illogical. To explain this requires spoilers.WARNING: SPOILERS Smith distrusts robots because one chose to rescue him from a submerged vehicle, sacrificing a young woman in the process. The robot did not take into account that she was a young woman; it saved Smith because he had a better chance of survival. HELLO! A human rescue team might have done EXACTLY the same thing.It was a nice touch to make Smith partially bionic. Too bad, they do anything in the way of philosophical commentary about. After all, as 'The Six Million Dollar Man' comes closer to reality (DARPA has a major program for just that) and artificial intelligence reaches the level of sentient, the question will arise 'What exactly IS human?'

American Beauty," Destined to be the most Overrated Movie of the Year
","AMERICAN BEAUTY, or DAVID LYNCH DIRECTS THE WONDER YEARS, is the VANITY FAIR crowds idea of a great movie.  You know, those people whom decry narrow mindedness then stereotype everyone whom disagrees with them.  The crowd who decries materialism, while riding around in their Volvos or Mercedes Benzes. AMERICAN BEAUTY has something to offend everybody: explicit adultery, drug usage, teen sex, statutory rape, teen nudity, masturbation, males kissing, extreme domestic violence, voyerism, excessive profanity; let's see, have I left out anything?  The movie IS (mostly) well acted (especially Mena Suvari and Wes Bentley), the exceptions being the campy homosexual couple, played by Sam Robards and Scott Bakula.  PLEEEASE! Can't we have some non-swishy homosexual role models for once?  Of course not; it's THAT kind of movie. And, of course, the LEAST screwed up character in the entire film turns out to be a teen drug dealer.  He 'sees' the REAL beauty in the world, including that in Kevin Spacey's 'homely,' 'flat- chested' daughter (Thora Birch). BEELIEEEVE ME; Thora Birch is NEITHER homely NOR flat-chested!  Director Sam Mendes and Writer Alan Ball DO provide SOME surprising moments.  However, both the 'revelation' about the nubile teen temptress (Mena Suvari) and the 'surprise' killer are, at once, too pat AND unconvincing. AMERICAN BEAUTY is not even as quirky, imaginative, surprising or funny as the average episode of NORTHERN EXPOSURE.  And, as the VANITY FAIR crowd LOVES to do, AMERICAN BEAUTY celebrates the beauty of life while focusing on its ugliness. A REAL quibble.  In at LEAST three places in the film, transition marks are clearly visible on the print (as though we were watching workprint, rather than a final 'cut').  Are Spielberg, Katzenberg, and Geffen THAT cheap that they wouldn't afford to reshoot those three scenes?  Criminy, one of them was an AERIAL shot with a Kevin Spacey voiceover!Considering the glowing reviews, this is DEFINITELY destined to be the most overrated movie of the year.",Null,0,0,26 September 1999
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Weak Premise, Great Movie
","Terminator 2 depends upon a premise contradictory to the original.  Since, according to THE TERMINATOR, only living things can travel through time, how could the completely liquid metal T1000 travel through time?  The theatrically released version also has one other very weak point.  How does John Connor (Edward Furlong) recognize the T1000 copy of Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) from his mother?  The Special Edition clarifies this, showing the T1000 malfunctioning.  This crucial scene should never have been deleted from the theatrical release.  Also, the only fakey sequences in the film are two shots using Stan Winston's Oscar-winning special effects.  Other than the T1000 malfunction sequence, the additional material in the Special Edition gives the film a sluggish middle.  Still, this an extremely powerful film, with fine acting from everyone, especially Robert Patrick, who is chilling as the T1000.",8,0,2,14 July 1999
The Patriot," Dime Store Patriotism. And Mel's Stuck in a Rut!
","WARNING:  SPOILERS AHEAD.In THE PATRIOT, Mel Gibson portrays `Benjamin Martin,' a former `hero' of the French and Indian War, now wants nothing more than to raise his large family on his South Carolina farm, and wants no part of the `revolution' being waged around him.  However, Mel's oldest son, Gabriel (       ) is seduced by the siren song of  `adventure' and `patriotism.'  Soon, Gabriel discovers first hand the horrors of war; and, though the `romance' and `adventure' is lost to him forever, the germ of `patriotism' grows to full bloom, symbolized by his repairing of a tattered `Betsy Ross' flag.While performing his duties as a dispatch rider, Gabriel is wounded and returns to his father's house for assistance.   Meanwhile, a major battle rages just beyond Martin's farm.  Gabriel awakes to find the battle over, won by the British, and his father lending medical assistance to BOTH British and American soldiers. Gabriel prepares to leave, when he discovers that his father has turned the dispatch papers over to the British.  Though the British Lieutenant is a decent man, the British Colonel is as cruel as he is stupid.  The writers of this film would have us believe, that this Colonel would drive off Martin's livestock and `field workers' (Mel is the `good guy;' perish the thought that he would have slaves!), burn his farm, shoot all the wounded American prisoners, except for Gabriel (whom he plans to hang) and kill Mel's fifteen year old son for resisting, but leave Mel unharmed, and not even search the house for weapons!  DUH!!!! For almost three sluggish hours, Gibson plays cat and mouse with this horrid Colonel.  The film is a revenge tale and little more.  Only in the last five minutes of  the film does Gibson display even a symbolic interest in the outcome of the war.  He passes up an opportunity to dispatch his enemy to carry the flag his son repaired and lead the American troops in a rout of the British.  Even then the movie cheats, the British Colonel comes after Gibson, setting himself up for Gibson's revenge (mighty nice of him).During the course of the film, we discover Mel's `heroism' during the French and Indian War consisted of  torturing and dismembering French and Cherokee whom had massacred American men, women and children.  As they say, what goes around Â…This is not to say THE PATRIOT is without its pleasures.  Mel is charming, as almost always, even if he IS playing pretty much the same character he usually plays.  The film abounds with some terrific performances, particularly among the subplot characters.  Special note must be given Heath Ledger (Gabriel) and Lisa Brenner (Anne Howard).  These two have tremendous careers ahead of them, hopefully in movies better than THE PATRIOT. Unfortunately, many of our favorite characters are dispatched in especially cruel ways (think Waco) during the course of the film.   The historical inaccuracies (as well as the brutality) prevent this film from inspiring what should have been its target audience (young people with little sense of America's history).  THE PATRIOT, alas, is revenge and brutality, served up as `dime store' patriotism.  If you really want to show your family inspiring movies about the revolution, try THE DEVIL'S DISCIPLE or the director's cut of 1776.  Both are pretty bawdy, but both are historically accurate and have a genuine feel for what truly was at stake in the American Revolution.",6,0,2,5 July 2000
Ender's Game," Almost profound, but a miss is a miss
","'Cracks' appear in the veneer of 'Ender's game, right from the beginning. The camera feed of Mazer Rackham's destruction of a Formic civilization mother ship ends abruptly, going to black rather than static. The production design is uninspired, not nearly as interesting as that of 'Skyline' or 'Lockout,' which were a fraction of the cost. The weapons and weapons platforms are as anachronistic as 'Battlestar Galactica' (2004), a considerably more profound project than 'Ender's Game'. What 'Ender's Game' DOES have are great performances by Asa Butterfield and Harrison Ford. In my opinion, this is Ford's best performance, as he gives a human face to a 'monster'. Asa Butterfield is flawless; I have never seen such an assured performance from such a young actor. Heck, many of the most-honored veterans could not pull off such a difficult role. Butterfield and director Gavin Hood manage to make 'Ender's Game' a near-great, if not great film for the first two-thirds, despite its predictability and other shortcomings. However, when Ender reaches advanced military training the movie begins to fall apart. Director Hood, excellent with ensemble actors, is simply NOT an 'action director'. As producer, Hood should have recognized this and budgeted for John Woo, who proved his supreme worth in handling spectacle with 'Red Cliff'. Then,there is Ben Kingsley, who brings nothing extra to a underwritten role.The horrendous 'secret' of Ender's Game is obvious from the beginning. Ender, who clearly regrets some of his choices, is disappointingly indifferent to his team, who share his guilt; and should, eventually, at least, feel the consequences. This is the fatal flaw in 'Ender's Game,' almost profound, but a miss is still a miss.I give 'Ender's Game' a week '7,' based entirely on the acting and message.",7,0,1,3 March 2014
Being John Malkovich," Neither Fiche nor Foul (Well, maybe a little)
","BEING JOHN MALKOVICH opens brilliantly, an unbelievably beautiful demonstration of puppeteering, which introduces us to Craig Schwartz (John Cusak), a tormented artist, far more capable of communicating his passions and angst via his puppets than directly to his wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz). Not too surprising, since Lotte is a fairly gross and dirty human being, who kisses and shares her beverages with her chimpanzee. In fact, the most unbelievable line in the movie is Lotte asking Craig to let her 'take a shower.') Lotte doesn't strike me a person whom would ever want one.  Perhaps due to this, Craig becomes immediately smitten when he meets Maxine (Christine Keener), a slightly slutty, fairly attractive gold digger, when he answers an ad for a 'man with fast hands to do filing' at Dr. Lester's (Orson Bean).  What Dr. Lester does is not all that clear, but the business apparently involves handling files for other companies. Interesting, because the offices are tiny, and not just because the place has 'low overhead,' being the 7 1/2 floor.  Anyway, while filing, Craig discovers an opening behind one of the cabinets.  Entering it, he discovers a portal into actor John Malcovich's psche.  Up to this point the movie is a brilliant existentialist comedy (the best since BRAZIL).  However, about two thirds of the way through the film, too much information is revealed, turning the film into fantasy/sci fi. Sorry, this movie doesn't have the budget for it.  It makes an old OUTER LIMITS episode look like STAR WARS EPISODE 1 by comparison.  It also calls into question everything which has proceeded.  Fantasy/sci fi must be grounded in some form of plausibility.  Companies which keep files either have huge climate controlled storage, use disks or, at least microfiche. Dirty or not, Diaz is still too desirable to make Craig's obsession with Maxine (Catherine Keener) all that convincing. Diaz is good in the part, but her casting throws the film way off.  Either the producers should have cast Ellen DeGeneres in the part, or have cast Michelle Pfieffer as Maxine.Ultimately, BEING JOHN MALKOVICH is a fairly amusing disappointment, much better in concept than execution.",7,1,2,21 February 2000
Collateral," Maybe I Expected Too Much
","I was genuinely excited to watch collateral. The previews looked so promising. Tom Cruise playing a bad guy was just too much to pass up. I've liked Jamie Foxx ever since 'In Living Color,' and admired Michael Mann since 'Thief'. Sorry to say, I can understand why 'Collateral' barely broke even. Despite fine performances, I never felt drawn in, only an observer of a slick, manipulative movie. Some of the dialogue was nearly unintelligable, which also didn't help. Also, there seemed only minimal chemistry between Foxx and Jada Pinkett, possibly due to the contrived opening scenes between them. Mann also should've used a better known actor to play the undercover cop that tries to help Foxx, and maybe a lesser known actress to play Pinkett's role, given her passive efforts in the story.WARNING: SPOILERS Yellow cabs with broken windows stick out like a sore thumb. I know, my first day in LA in the seventies, I was stopped ten minutes after I got on the road in my car with a broken windshield. Why didn't Cruise find another car, even another cab instead of running the risk of being detected? The worst thing about 'Collateral' is the ending. Jada Pinket, as a prosecutor, is an officer of the court, and she committed a criminal act when she and Jamie left Cruise's dead body on the train. Why didn't they just pull the emergency handle? Besides, don't LA Metro trains have TV cameras in the cars? Further, Cruise may have still had the memory stick on his person. There was a chance the LCD unit left in Foxx's cab would fail, costing him the only physical evidence that Cruise was 'Vincent'.END OF SPOILERS Despite these whoppers of logic, 'Collateral' is still an entertaining movie. Just don't expect a great one.I give 'Collateral' a weak '7'.",7,1,3,8 January 2005
The Lego Movie," Brilliant movie marred by awkward live-action scenes
","Until the last 20 minutes of 'The Lego Movie,' I was about to call it, 'the best animated feature ever'. Full of the madcap 'Looney Tunes' humor and sly references to the New World Order and libertarian advocacy, I had, to that point, loved every minute. THEN, Will Ferrell shows up and spoils everything. Actually, the unfortunate choice to 'wire the ghost' was the first slip-up. However, the live action scenes with Will Ferrell just laid there. Most of the problems in these scenes are likely the fault of the director or editor. In any event, they completely destroy the pacing of the movie. Darn; and I was hoping to say I liked 'The Lego Movie' better than 'Big Hero 6; which, ironically, reaches its level of brilliance at nearly the same point as 'The Lego Movie' falls apart. Oh well, NEARLY 'everything is awesome'.I give 'The Lego Movie' an '8'.",Null,0,1,23 June 2015
Dallas Buyers Club," Great movie. More importantly, great message about the FDA
","'Dallas Buyers Club' does not fit in my usual tastes of subject matter. I saw it primarily because of Matthew McConaughey, who has evolved from a 'caterpillar' to a 'butterfly' over the last 15 years. I hated McConaughey in 'Contact,' tolerated him in 'The Wedding Planner' and 'Failure to Launch,' but loved him in 'Reign of Fire,' 'The Lincoln Lawyer,' 'The Paperboy,' 'Killer Joe,' 'Magic Mike,' 'Mud' and this movie. Imagine my surprise when I discovered Jared Leto's fine performance AND the GREAT message about the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The Rockefellers CREATED the FDA as a shill for 'Big Pharma'. The FDA harasses, threatens or outright outlaws alternative medical treatments, which could save live. The FDA usurped this power; it has NO power to do so and is not even Constitutional. Recently the FDA ordered the REMOVAL of natural Statin from Red Yeast Rice, even though natural Statin is SAFE, unlike the Statin drugs used to lower cholesterol. Independent studies can measure the efficacy and safety of drugs; and alternative medical treatments and natural products can safely replace MOST prescription drugs. A board-certified MD, who practiced alternative medicine three days a week, once told me, 'If you had AIDS, I could cure it. However, if I did, I would lose my license and go to jail.' THIS is the legacy of the FDA. By the way, during the time period of this movie, the NEW YORK TIMES reported French doctors were CURING AIDS by passing a patient's blood through tubes exposed to ultraviolet light.I also need to mention the fine performances of both Jennifer Garner and Griffin Dunne, who play sympathetic doctors, one of whom has lost his license over prescribing non-approved treatments. I gave this movie a '9' instead of a '10' because the last quarter tends to drag and the ending feels a bit flat. However, the message is so important, and the performances so fine, I urge every adult to see 'The Dallas Buyers Club'.",9,1,1,30 March 2014
The Fast and the Furious," Rob Cohen reinvents the Hod Rod Movie
","Like costars Vin Diesel and Michelle Rodriguez, `The Fast and the Furious' is sleek, sexy, all attitude and dubious morality.  Expect no surprises from the thin script, just hot metal, great tunes, flash and pizzaz.  Paul Walker is the GQ-Pretty Anglo love interest.  Jordan Brewster plays Diesel's baby sister.  Both are pros, but they pale against the impact of Diesel and Rodriguez.  Also of special note are Giovanni Ribisi-clone Chad Lindbert as Jesse and Matt Schulze as Vince, Diesel's childhood buddy and Walker's rival for Brewster.

Ocean's Eleven," Like Wrapping Junk in Christmas Paper
","What was it that seduced critics and audiences into believing this is a good movie?  Was it the star-studded cast?  The slick film and sound editing? The sometimes clever dialogue and genuinely clever pickpocket routines by Matt Damon?  The fine performances by Brad Pitt, Andy Garcia and the eccentric one by Don Cheadle?  Steven Soderberg's overblown reputation? Tell me, I want to know, because `Oceans Eleven' is not a particularly good movie.WARNING:  SPOILERS1. Julia Roberts and George Clooney have ZERO chemistry. 2. How does Clooney know WHOM Andy Garcia will hire to beat him up? 3. EMP bombs are forever.  Electric circuits would NOT be restored in less than a minute and people in hospital surgeries and emergency would probably die.  (How slick is THAT?) 4. These guys made the theft of the EMP bomb look routine.  It would probably be as difficult as getting into the casino safe. 5. Andy Garcia would be the LEAST of these guys' problems.  NSA would be VERY interested in some who stole and discharged an EMP bomb in a major American city. 6. The Mormon twins were such bumbling clowns they would have been caught in a week. 7. What's this with Reiner's apparent medical problems?  Was he REHEASING for the heart attack? 8.   These guys gloated too much.  Had they pulled this thing off like `The Sting,' they might have gotten away with it.  (The ending makes it fairly clear they didn't).  Their talents would make them easy to track down (creating a sequel that would more likely to be SICK than SLICK). 8. What KIND of credit is `And introducing Julia Roberts as Tess'?  Roberts is the highest paid and most successful of ALL these people.`Oceans Eleven' is the filmatic equivalent of wrapping junk in Christmas paper. I give it a `6'.",6,0,1,29 July 2002
Pearl Harbor," The Song is NOT the Worst Thing About This Movie
","Although the theme song from 'Pearl Harbor' by the usually terrific Faith Hill is annoying sappy, it is by no means the WORST thing about this movie. That honor, unfortunately belongs to the embarrassingly trite main plot of friendship lost and reclaimed due to lover's triangle. That device was probably old hat by the time of 'Wings' (1929). However, to cheapen one of the most fateful and sorry episodes in American military history, while at the same time whitewashing Roosevelt's treachery, does a disservice to those who died for political expediency. Worse, producer Jerry Bruckheimer has assembled a cast made up largely of nasty, partisan liberals to preach to us how terrible we were NOT to see the threat posed by the Axis powers. Today it is generally known (if not widespread knowledge) that Roosevelt goaded the Japanese into war. Recent evidence even indicates US forces likely struck first. However, since this is ENTERTAINMENT and, moreso, a 'human drama,' let's focus on the real shortcomings of 'Pearl Harbor'. First, most of the film takes place in other locations, the 'sneak attack' taking place in the middle third of the picture. The performances are fairly good, with the exception of John Voight, who plays President Roosevelt. John Voight looks and sounds like, well John Voight. He is utterly unconvincing, never more so than, in a possible flashback to 'Coming Home,' Voight, as Roosevelt, stands up on polio-paralyzed legs in front of his war staff. According to all accounts, the incident never happened and, as portrayed, is cheap theatrics.Most of 'Pearl Harbor' plays in a manner fitting the theme song, overproduced and bombastic. However, all of the technical credits (cinematography, costuming, set decoration, special effects) are terrific. However, you would do better to see 'Tora! Tora! Tora!,' 'From Here to Eternity,' even the miniseries 'Pearl' if you want accuracy, believability and even good drama.",5,1,2,14 November 2003
Duck You Sucker," Sergio Leone's Sad, Funny, Beautiful Epic Western
","Coming off the triumphs of his 'Man With No Name' series and his frustrations with the cutting of 'The Good, The Bad & The Ugly' and 'Once Upon a Time in the West,' Sergio Leone directed the big budget, epic western, originally titled, 'Once Upon a Time in the Revolution'. Since '...West' had been released by Paramount and United Artists was releasing '...Revolution,' some executive decide the rename the movie 'Duck! You Sucker!' after the phrase Sean (James Coburn) uses repeatedly before blowing someone or something up with dynamite. Likely the same executive choose an advertising campaign reminiscent of 'The Good, The Bad & The Ugly,' creating caricatures of Sean and Juan (Rod Steiger) adding the caption '...the master of adventure, Sergio Leone'. Well, I doubt many theater audiences knew who Sergio Leone was, since he was yet to be recognized as a directoral genius the equal of John Ford or Howard Hawks. Worse, the advertising implied 'Duck! You Sucker! was a laugh romp, a parody of Leone's early masterpieces. This impression was made even worse when the film failed to perform. In any event, 'A Fistfull of Dyanmite' was a dismal failure at the box office and Leone never made another big budget western drama.It's too bad, because 'A Fistfull of Dynamite' is Leone's trueist work, his most accurate vision of life, politics and revolution. Neither Rod Steiger nor James Coburn were strongly associated with westerns, even though both played strong roles in earlier films (Steiger in 'Run of the Arrow' and 'Jubal,' Coburn in 'The Magnificent Seven' and 'Ride Lonesome'. Worse, Steiger's Juan looked like something of a buffoon and the movies villains were bland and underdeveloped. However, I believe this was Leone's intention: corrupt politicians and Prussian officers are pretty well interchangeable. Kill one and another pops up. This isn't a very satisfying truth, but it is truth, nonetheless. Juan is a peasant, a bandit with a large family of bandits. Sean is a Irish Republican Army terrorist, an explosives expert. In Leone's world, or at least in all his films, there are only two types of people: predators and victims. His major characters are all predators. The only thing that distinguishes his protagonists from his antagonists is that his antagonists start with a large body count and his protagonists usually spare the innocent. That works with a taut enough storyline, but '...Dynamite' covers large areas of real estate and the goal is never clear. Juan didn't plan to become a hero of the revolution, and that is small payment for his losses. When one looks at history, the rewards of revolution and warfare are never worth the sacrifices, for just as we kill one bastard, another takes his place.I think 'A Fistfull of Dynamite' largely reflects Leone's fate as well. Leone proved he was the greatest western director in less than four years with only four major films. Yet, he was hardly appreciated during his short life and only a few films after his magnificent achievement. 'A Fistfull of Dynamite' is also Leone's saddest movie. A beautiful, big budget metaphor for a man's talent wasted by underappreciate film executive and smug, self-serving critics.Coburn should have won an 'Oscar' for 'Dynamite.' With the exception of some tabletop model trains, the effects are convincing and exciting. The color cinematography is phenomenal, clearly the equal of 'Once Upon a Time in the West. The sound and music (by Ennio Morricone) is phenomenal, as usual. While not as satisfying as Leone's best films, 'A Fistfull of Dynamite' is an exemplary film. I give it a '9'.",9,105,128,8 October 2004
Tropic Thunder," 'Beneath it's hard surface .'
","'Topic Thunder' seems the perfect title for a war movie parody, certainly better than 'Hot Shots, Part Deux.' 'Tropic Thunder' also suggests a kind of suntan lotion spread on imagined hard bodies lying around the Olympic size pool of fictional movie mogul Sid Grossman (modeled on Joel Silver, perhaps?). Sadly, like most suntan oils, 'Tropic Thunder' does not live up to its promise to protect the delicate skins of those buying the product.Tug Speedman (Ben Stiller) is an amalgam of shallow action movie heroes, bulked up like Stallone, but more clearly modeled on Tom Cruise. Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black) is a blend of Chris Farley and Eddie Murphy and Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey, Jr.) is certainly the method-obsessed Aussie, Russell Crowe. What could be more hilarious than Sid Grossman being played by Tom Cruise, who, once again, demonstrates he is not only a good sport but also a terrific supporting actor? Cruise and Downey are both pitch perfect and well deserving of their Golden Globe nominations.'Tropic Thunder,' on the other hand, is a disappointment. What, in my opinion, the three best movie parodies ('Young Frankenstein,' 'Galaxy Quest' and 'Hot Shots, Part Deux') shared in common was heart. With its excessive grossness and mean-spirited take on all its characters, including its target audience, 'Tropic Thunder,' has, beneath its hard surface, a heart as cold, cynical and shallow as the movies it parodies. I give 'Tropic Thunder' a '6'.",6,1,2,22 December 2008
Legends of the Fall," 'East of Eden'? More Like 'South of Podunk'
","This beautifully mounted period melodrama sports fine performances by Anthony Hopkins, Julie Ormand and (especially) Aidan Quinn (looking phenomenally like he could really be Hopkins son). Nevertheless, this 'East of Eden' wannabe is surprisingly unmoving.  Not because of Brad Pitt, whom gives a more than passable performance in a horribly underwritten role.  No, this film is empty at the core, not giving us enough to like in Tristin (Pitt) or to dislike in Alfred (Quinn) to understand what the fuss is all about.  Like another finely crafted failure, FAR AND AWAY, this film reminds us no amount of artistry can overcome an overblown, sometimes silly script. This is not even in the same galaxy as 'East of Eden.' No, 'Legends of the Fall' is more like 'South of Podunk.'",5,1,4,31 August 2000
District 9," Kitchen sink scifi allegory ... but it works
","As an allegory for all refugees (particularly the Palestinians), there's certainly nothing original about 'District 9'. The plot includes elements of 'Alien Nation,' 'The Fly,' 'Robocop,' 'E.T.,' and, of all things, 'Laserblast' and 'A.L.F.'. Sharlto Copley plays his bungling bureaucrat as a mix of Steve Martin's 'Inspector Clouseau,' Jonathan Pryce's 'Sam Lowry' and Linda Hamilton's 'Sarah Connor' in 'The Terminator'. At first I had trouble Copley's performance; then, I realized it was key to caring about his character's fate.The cinema verite used in 'District 9,' while effective, was much better executed in 'Cloverfield;' which is, also, a much better movie. Nonetheless, 'District 9' works well. I give it a '7' out of '10'.",7,0,2,2 January 2010
Mamma Mia!," More than 'putting lipstick on a pig'
","I must admit, when I first agreed to watch 'Mama Mia!' with my wife, I felt I was doing penance for some terrible slight that I didn't remember. I've always considered ABBA to be a 'guilty pleasure,' songs too inconsequential for me to change the FM station, but nothing I'd even consider having in my collection. I honestly believe ABBA represents the 70s at its worst, conspiring perfectly with the dreadful clothing styles and visual elements of the time. Further, the trite, contrived storyline is as appropriately dreadful as the music and costumes. That being said, I am thankfully pleased to state that 'Mama Mia!' is the most thoroughly entertaining film I've seen and heard this year (Pierce Brosnan's singing, notwithstanding), beautifully choreographed, photographed and directed. While Meryl Streep deservedly receives accolades, the ensemble performances are all perfect.If I have any quibble at all, it's why the producers cut one of ABBAs 'best' songs, particularly since the sequence is less than 2 minutes.I give 'Mama Mia!' an 8.",8,3,6,20 December 2008
Remember the Titans," Inspiring, Entertaining and One Truly Amazing Performance
","Although a mite too predictable, 'Remember the Titans' is an inspiring and entertaining movie.  The true story of the integration of a Virginia high school football team and the warm multicultural relationships which developed among the team members, staff and families, the film reminds us once again when working together in a common effort, one can find love and friendship in the most unlikely places.  As the head coach, Denzel Washington uses military-style techniques which have been shown time and again to succeed in creating unity and team spirit among people from different backgrounds.  Big surprise here.  The film's most important lesson is for people to give each other enough respect and trust before making judgements about other people.  The film glosses over the genuine cultural differences between black and white communities.  They do exist, though are generally minimal among people of the same socioeconomic class. This isn't really important except to those who feel this kind of thing has been done to death over the last three decades.  Even they will find plenty to enjoy in 'Remember the Titan's'.  There's plenty of humor and action (some really tough looking football plays).  There is also one truly amazing performance, that of Hayden Panettiere as Cheryl Yost.  Hayden is TOTALLY convincing as Will Patton's football-obsessed daughter.  She's also spunky, charming and strong-willed. There's nothing bitchy about this little girl.  You believe she could tear your head off if she put her mind to it.  Yet, She still manages to be very feminine and cute.  As I said, a truly amazing performance.This movies a keeper.  I'll probably pull this one out about once a year just to lift my spirits.",7,9,18,14 May 2001
Man on the Moon," ANDY, WE HARDLY KNEW YA, THANK GOODNESS!
","MAN ON THE MOON is a thoroughly unpleasant little movie about Andy Kaufman. Andy Kaufman was a gifted performance artist of the 1970s and 80s, with, unfortunately, the self-discipline of a mean-spirited seven year-old. Thoroughly unpleasant little movies generally are rewarded with small audiences and grosses, and this one, thankfully, is no exception.   Unfortunately for Universal, MAN ON THE MOON cost 100 million dollars, largely for the salary of star Jim Carrey, for whom this movie can only be called a 'vanity piece.' Carrey is in virtually EVERY scene; worse, no other actor is given a chance to 'break out' and show any real emotional range.  Worse, Carrey 'imitates' Kaufman's best bits, but never succeeds in submerging himself in the role. In any event, that may have been a futile task.  No one seems to have known whom 'Andy Kaufman' really was.  To paraphrase Courtney Love's character, 'There is no 'real [Andy Kaufman].''Some of what Kaufman did was funny, hilariously so (largely his TAXI work, which he disowned).  Most, unfortunately, was rude, condescending, self-indulgent, embarrassing, cruel and, worst, unfunny.  Too bad, this is the work that is largely on display in MAN ON THE MOON.  While we long for Latka Gravas and Vic Ferrari, we get Tony Clifton and the 'Intergender Wrestling Champion.'  The stars of TAXI are exploited; but what made THAT show great is entirely excluded.   Would it have been too much for ONE interchange between Latka (Carrey) and Simka (Carol Kane)?  All Kane gets to do is sit around looking embarrassed and slightly frightened at 'Tony Clifton's' antics.  Kaufman may have thought TAXI (and his contribution to it) was junk; but, just because Kaufman was a great performance artist doesn't make him a good judge of his own work.MAN ON THE MOON is not a terrible movie.  It's just a terribly wrongheaded movie.  It's about as much fun as root canal work; as was, unfortunately, much of Andy Kaufman's 'humor.'   And, to you die-hard Kaufman fans, who might be offended by that comment; hey guys, I'm only joking...",5,0,0,13 January 2000
The Transporter," Lean and Mean Just Like its Star
","'The Transporter' is a surprisingly well made, if routine action-adventure film. There's a better story here than the one told, but star Jason Statham delivers the goods and has a real future as an action star. Statham is the most virile action hero since Sam Elliot and is built like a hairy Greek god. He also sounds like Billy Idol. I saw this movie primarily to see Qi Shu, who impressed me so much in Jackie Chan's 'Gorgeous'. Qi Shu has the kind of face that looks as if it were made of the parts of two different beautiful women. Her mouth certainly doesn't go with her eyes and nose and keeps her from being stunningly beautiful. However, she uses her mouth the way many actors use their eyes, and her contribution to 'The Transporter' and cinema is largely due to that expressive mouth. She's perfect in 'The Transporter,' giving her character much more than is written.What keeps 'The Transporter' from being first rate is the directing and editing. Much of the dialogue is unintelligible and some of the action scenes suffer from unwise editing. Watch the 'deleted scenes,' which are actually extended fights and you'll see what I mean. Had the fight scenes been left intact,the movie be worth a '7'. As presented, however, I give 'The Transporter' a '6'.",6,0,1,9 October 2004
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Contains the best and worst elements of the series.
","I have mixed emotions about 'Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol'. I really like that this film has finally abandoned the 'lone wolf' grandstanding by Tom Cruise and has finally returned to the roots of the series; that being, the Impossible Missions Force is an ensemble effort in which EVERY participant is essential to the success of the mission. That being said, I had some real problems with the cheesy credits (look by Maurice Binder rejects for a Bond movie), plodding script, unbelievable climax and denouement that undermines Ethan Hunt's character with some highly questionable behavior.However, how can one argue with a movie with outstanding action sequences, breathtaking scenery and camera-work, full-figured women in beautiful dresses displaying lots of cleavage and just the right touches of camaraderie and humor?Some quibbles, however. How come the IMF in this movie seem better equipped than usual, even when officially cut off from most of their government assets? Also, while the 'rover' might have a hydrogen fuel cell capable of producing enough magnetic force to levitate a 175 pound man, the magnetic field would be so intense as to probably render the man unconscious, if not kill him outright.Nonetheless, I give 'Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol' a '7'.",7,0,1,19 April 2012
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Great Martial Arts Film. Great movie? Well...
","After a year of disappointing movies (witness the mediocre GLADIATOR and ERIN BROCKOVITCH), I was hoping to see a Best Picture nominee which I could endorse.  Alas, CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON is NOT it. How can one enthusiastically endorse a movie whose opening scene is sofuzzy, whose dialogue track is so hollow, which has several key scenes which are so choppily edited, whose story is so convoluted, whose ending is so nihilistic and with those stupid 'flying' sequences, in many of which the harnesses are clearly visible.HOWEVER, I can state without a doubt, CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON contains the greatest fighting sequences AND one of the finest film performances I have yet witnessed.  That BOTH these can be attributed to one performer, Ziyi Zhang, is absolutely remarkable.To explain almost any of the story would ruin the fun, so I won't. The film summary does that quite perfectly, thank you. Interestly women totally dominate this movie.  All of the fight sequences occur EITHER between a man and a woman, two women or one woman and several men.  In almost all instances, the woman wins.  When that woman is Ziyi Zhang, one can well believe she would.  NOBODY I've ever seen is faster.By all means, see CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON, particularly if you enjoy great martial arts.  Just don't expect too much.  This movie is WAY too overpraised.",7,0,0,18 March 2001
Mr. Nobody," Flawed near-masterpiece box office dud
","Beautifully directed, photographed, edited, and, mostly acted, 'Mr. Nobody' is testimony to how even the best films prospects can be destroyed by horrendous marketing. While 'Mr. Nobody' may be an accurate title, it is a horrible title for a movie of such scope and accomplishment. Perhaps the horrid title is why only a few US theaters played this movie, returning only a few thousand dollars on a film which cost $47M. Fortunately, streaming video makes it possible to see this flawed near-masterpiece. In fact, I saw the theatrical version as part of the Netflix streaming package; and the director's cut, which addresses all but one of what I consider 'flaws' is available on Amazon streaming. My only criticism of both versions is the casting of Diane Kruger as the adult 'Anna'. Juno Temple, an adult actress who plays juvenile roles, is, again, world class, with the intensity needed for the pivotal 'Anna'. On the other hand, Diane Kruger, lacks both Ms. Temple's intensity and disproportionately large breasts, which makes it pretty hard to believe she is the same character. Better that Temple be aged with makeup or digitally. Nonetheless, 'Mr. Nobody' emerges as one my Top 20 all-time favorite films. I give 'Mr. Nobody' a '9'.",9,3,4,15 November 2015

","'X-Men 3: The Last Stand' is so underdeveloped, it plays as more a continuation than a sequel to the fine 'X-Men 2'. While better paced, more exciting and with much better special effects than the first 'X-Men' film, the paucity of character development, alas, makes it the weakest entry so far in the series. The film is further drained of urgency by the elimination of two of the most compelling mutants during the first quarter of the film and a pivotal character by the half-way point. Some interesting characters from 'X-Men 2' are, here, no where to be found. While Kelsey Grammar does his best to make his role interesting, he simply has too little to do. Halle Berry, usually so effective, lacks resonance or substance in her nonaction dramatic scenes. 'X-Men 3' is certainly an entertaining time killer, but nothing more than that. I give 'X-Men 3' a 5.",5,2,4,9 January 2007
Driven," We Gotta Buy this Movie!
","As soon as the end credits began to roll, my fiance turned to me and said, 'Bob, as soon as this comes out on DVD, we gotta buy this movie!' That's testimony to our our enthusiasm about 'Driven.'  I like movies about racing far more than I like racing itself.  This just replaced 'Grand Prix' as being my favorite movie about racing.  I write for a hobby and I am genuinely impressed with Stallone's writing here.  Thanks to Stallone's writing and Renny Harlin's incredible direction, I felt I was one of the characters in 'Driven.'  I didn't always completely understand what was going on between the characters (which is why I gave this movie a '9' instead of a '10'.  BUT, one does not always understand what is going on between people in REAL LIFE, either.  'Driven' has great writing, direction, sound, editing, cinematography, special effects and music.  Performances are both natural and memorable. I CARED about ALL the characters, even those I disliked at first.The theme of this movie is forgiveness.  It's almost as if Stallone is forgiving himself and asking forgiveness for being the jerk he was whenhe left Sasha for Brigette Nielson and began taking his acting persona WAY too seriously.  Stallone turns in the films best performance. With 'Driven,' Stallone has proved he deserves another chance. I'm glad this movie has been more popular at the boxoffice than it has been with critics and writers at the IMDB.'We're gonna buy this movie.'",9,0,0,28 May 2001
I Am Legend," 'a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, Signifying nothing.'
","Lavishly produced and beautifully acted by Will Smith, 'I am Legend' is but a shadow of the seminal novel by classic fantasy/science fiction writer Richard Matheson ('What Dreams May Come,' 'A Stir of Echos,' 'The (Incredible) Shrinking Man' and 'Bid Time Return ('Somewhere in Time)'. '...Legend,' unfortunately more closely follows 'The Omega Man' than 'The Last Man on Earth,' the first film based upon Matheson's novel. Matheson conceived of a world-wide plague which not only killed EVERYONE but Dr. Robert Neville, it turned the undead into vampires. Thus, Neville's dual mission was to rid the world of vampires AND find a cure for the plague of which he was the only one immune. Since Neville was 'bringing peace' to the undead, his actions were far more 'justifiable' than Heston's ('The Omega Man) or Smith's ('I am Legend'). However, Neville learns many of the 'vampires' he was killing were actually plague sufferers; and, among those who survived, Neville was a horrific 'legend,' not a saintly one.While 'I am Legend' is much superior to 'Omega Man' in dramatic terms, the plot holes are nearly as horrific as the plot. WHO set the 'booby trap' for Neville? WHY did Anna or anyone else NOT respond to Neville's short wave transmission? WHY did the 'head ghoul' take so much interest in Neville's latest human experiment? While I understand the last question is answered in the deleted scenes, movies must stand on their own narrative or be rightly criticized. I would love to see a 'Director's cut' in order to ascertain whether or not these plot holes were closed. However, my primary criticism of the film (i.e., that Matheson's original theme has been turned on its head) would still apply. 'I am Legend' is impressive to look at and to savor Will Smith's fine performance; but, it is otherwise shallow. In this exercise of Matheson's classic, life really is but '...a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury. Signifying nothing.'I give 'I am Legend' a weak '6'.",6,0,1,23 July 2012

Even though many films use expressionistic elements ('Tom Jones,' 'A Hard Days Night,' 'Airplane,' 'The Naked Gun), I've seen only four films could genuinely be classified as 'expressionistic films:' 'The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari,' Fellini's 'Never Bet the Devil Your Head, Mel Brooks' 'Blazing Saddles' and now 'Moulin Rouge,' which is the LEAST successful of the four. The other films used expressionism to reinforce their themes.  However, unless writer/ director Baz Luhrman INTENDED an antiromantic picture (which I believe he did), his self-conscious, anachronistic artifices work AGAINST the main plot (i.e., the love story between the poor writer and the doomed cabaret singer).  While incredibly beautiful and dreamlike (Oscar worthy cinematography, set decoration, art direction, editing and sound) and boasting great performances by Nicole Kidman and Jim Broadbent, the main plot is uninvolving, the characters uninteresting and the film is ultimately unsatisfying.Possible Spoilers:I have several reasons for believing the film is MEANT to be antiromantic. Ewan McGregor's dialogue is chock full of 'modern' 'romantic' musical lyrics, integrated in a manner assured to bring laughter. The love songs between Kidman and McGregor, while lovely, all appear to be done tongue in cheek.  As McGregor 'sobs' over Kidman's lifeless body, he appears to be guffawing.  Baz Luhrman could have made his point complete if he'd included a 'lovers singing while walking in the clouds' sequence at the end of the movie.  Alas, I was left unclear as exactly what WERE his intentions. Oh well, perhaps that's on Disk 2 of the DVD.",6,0,1,2 January 2002
Rules of Engagement," Enjoyable Fantasy
","RULES OF ENGAGEMENT is a terrifically enjoyable fantasy of the way things ought to work in Washington.  Samuel Jackson plays a marine colonel accused of mass murder in a sorta 'reverse Waco' assault on Yemeni demonstrators.  Tommy Lee Jones plays Jackson's attorney, a marine almost broken by an ambush which killed the rest of his men and left him maimed.  An ambush HE survived only because Jackson violated the Geneva convention and murdered one of his prisoners.  Guy Pearce does a terrific job as the prosecuting attorney.  In fact, all the performances are solid.  WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD.  What detracts is the revelation in the middle of the film that Jackson is actually innocent and will be convicted only because the National Security Advisor withholds a key piece of evidence (a video tape).  This missing tape becomes the linchpin of Lee's defense of Jackson and leads to Jackson's acquittal and the eventual prosecution of the National Security Advisor. Anyone familiar with the last eight years of the Clinton Administration (particularly the atrocity at Waco) knows Washington doesn't work this way. The national media would have have crucified Jackson, and the military jury would have cowered and convicted.Anyway, RULES OF ENGAGEMENT is an enjoyable fantasy, as far as it goes.",7,0,1,19 June 2000
Event Horizon," A for Concept, D+ for Execution
","Seven years after experimental Spaceship EVENT HORIZON disappears, it reappears at its point of disappearance.  A rescue and recovery ship commanded by Lawrence Fishburne and carrying scientist Sam Neil races to the rescue.  But WHAT will they rescue?WARNING:  SPOILERS AHEAD.EVENT HORIZON is an experimental ship on on TOP SECRET mission. It carries a Graviton Drive, capable of creating its own 'black hole,' enabling travel between Neptune and Proxima Centauri (4.7 light-years) in 'about a minute.'   However, instead, the ship's gravity drive had opened a tear in the space-time continium, propelling the ship into another dimension; the dimension of Hell. What returned is a spaceship 'alive' with pure evil.The concept of 'Hell' being another dimension is certainly nothing new. However, this is the first time I have seen this concept applied in a science fiction film.  However, that is the limit of originality the director and writers have applied in EVENT HORIZON.  The movie gets shocking a grisly from the opening scene.  I would suggest both writer an director get themselves a stopwatch and sit through ALIEN, THE EXORCIST and THE HAUNTING (1964).  They might be surprised to find how long before ANYTHING genuinely frightening or grisley takes place. Shock, violence and gore are not suspense or fright.  I'd giveEVENT HORIZON an 'A' for concept and a D+ for execution.",5,0,1,7 February 2000
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," I Liked This MUCH Better Than the First
","While characterizations are skin deep, 'Resident Evil: Apacalypse' has a coherent story and a higher mission than simply thrills and chills, which was all the first boasted.WARNING: SPOILERS While genetic engineering and 'supersoldiers' are not new ideas (they were used on the last seasons of 'The X Files' and at least as early as 'Soldier,'), the very real possibility of DELIBERATE contamination and decimation of a US city under a cover story is a very REAL thing. The lack of originality here is actually comforting, given the mayhem that takes place.END OF SPOILERS Mila Jovavitch and Sienna Guillory make fetching killing machines and Oded Fehr gives solid masculine support. There is enough variations in the action to make the moving consistently interesting. The night shooting and low key lighting help immensely in producing suspense and shock moments.'Resident Evil: Apacalypse' does what it does and does it VERY will.

Mission: Impossible II," Sets a New High for Stunts
","If you sometimes go to the movies to be entertained by unbelievably daring stunts, this is the movie to see.  From Cruise's incredible rock climb to nail-biting motorcycle 'joist' this movie impresses with the stunts.  The plot could be written on the back of a postage stamp.  However, that's rarely what audiences go to see films like this for.  The performances are above average, particularly Dougray Scott and Thadie Newton. A pity Newton's character is underused during the second half of the film. Besides being beautiful, this woman can ACT! It is also refreshing to see a demonstrably romantic and affectionate interracial relationship portrayed on screen in such a positive manner. Newton's race never comes up in the film.  Credit producer Tom Cruise for this one. This is one of those movies I'd rent to give my home theatre system a workout.  This movie succeeds on its own level; however, I can understand how others could be disappointed. I gave this one a '7' on the IMDB scale.By the way, it was a clever touch to have Cruise receive his mission briefing via wrap-around sunglasses.  Kind of nice to be reminded of RISKY BUSINESS.",7,40,71,5 September 2000
The Dark Knight," We found ourselves squirming...
","While most of our favorite action movies run well over two hours ('Aliens,' 'The Abyss,' 'Terminator 2' and 'Leon: The Professional' run about 2 1/2 hours and 'Red Cliff' runs 5 hours), my wife and I found ourselves squirming about 2 hours into 'The Dark Knight'. Both of us felt the movie should have ended after the first climax, at approximately 1 hour, 55 minutes. One of my big problems with the movie is Christain Bale. Bale makes a bland Bruce Wayne and, when he disguises his voice as 'Batman,' his harsh whisper is barely intelligible. While Heath Ledger was brilliant as 'The Joker,' he still seemed to be channeling Jerry Lewis as 'The Nutty Professor'. While Gary Oldman gives a fine, restrained performance as 'Lt. Gordon,' I much prefer his over-the-top performances in 'Leon: The Professional' and 'The Fifth Element,' and I felt frustrated wanting him to 'cut loose.' Other than Ledger, the most memorable performances come from seasoned pros Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine and the wonderful, underrated Aaron Eckhart. The movie is simply much too busy, not given the action sequences enough set-up time for full impact. Nonetheless, given the wonderful production values and fine performances of the supporting cast, I give 'The Dark Knight' a solid '7'.",7,0,4,24 June 2012
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Charlie Kaufman Charlie Kaufm Charl
","Charlie Kaufman is the first writer auteur. I mean, how many people know I.A.L. Diamond (Billy Wilder's partner), Nunnelly Johnson (Howard Hawks, et al.) For once the screenwriter is all important (or at least most important). Change directors, change stars and you STILL have a distinctly 'Charlie Kaufman' event.Admittedly, 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' lacks the shear audacious originality of 'Being John Malcovitch' or 'Adaptation.' After John Woo had much the same concept for 'Paycheck.' Nonetheless, Charlie Kaufman and director Michel Gondry (He a low-tech genius) have fashioned a story out of time. Frequently, it is very difficult to determine 'what' is happening 'when;' and, for once, that's a good thing.It's Kaufman genius to place the company performing the 'brain damaging' treatment, in what appears to be a dishevel dentist's office. Or to give the 'medical' crew less professional than the worst 'roto rooter' service.Jim Carrey is brilliant as Joel, the uptight writer/artist of journals. Joel lives his life through his writing, whereas 'Clementine' (Kate Winslett, simply lives. It's Joel who suddenly realize the tremendous loss of experience, even the unpleasant ones.The profound subplot involving Kursten Dunst came at me right out of left field. However, this 'real time' experience gives the movie its weight; more so than anything Joel or Clementine express or experience.If Charlie Kaufman can be faulted, it's that he can't leave well enough alone. The silliness nearly undid 'Being John Malcovitch,' and it doesn't help here. If 'Adaptation' is any indication, this is due to Charlie's neuroses. I hope one day to see one of his movies, where he doesn't eventually cheapen his characters a mite with his absurdities. For now, it's just enough to appreciate the beauty of 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,' until it, too fades from conscious memory.Charlie Kaufman Charlie Kaufm CharlI give 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' a '9' for originality, performances, direction and singular profundity.",9,1,3,29 December 2004
The Mummy Returns," Could Use Tighter Wrapping
","`The Mummy Returns' brings back most, but not all the elements that made `The Mummy' such a hoot; i.e., exotic locales, larger than life characters, genuine humor and breakneck action.  However, suspense, which was not a hot commodity even in the first `Mummy' is TOTALLY absent here.Fortunately, all of the surviving principals are back.  However, Beni (Kevin J. O'Connor), the weasel, is sorely missed, and not altogether satisfactorily replaced.  Worse, there are TOO many villains, none of whom are given adequate screen time.  One would certainly wish for more of a contribution by Arnold Vosloo (the mummy).  Rachel Weisz looks incredibly fetching.  However, her ego must have gotten the best of her.  Can you imagine ANYONE explore insect-infested ruins wearing a Wonderbra and supermodel makeup?  Rachel probably couldn't stand how everyone (at least every male) stood up to take notice at Patricia Valazquez first appearance in `The Mummy,' wearing makeup and very little else.  Here Valazquez's most prominent assets are kept discretely tucked in her blouse (at least in the `contemporary' sequences), and she wears no makeup (a decision I am sure was dictated by Weisz).  Weisz needn't have worried.  Inept acting is a turnoff, and Valazquez is laughable in her key contemporary scene with Vosloo.The movie jumps into the action portion of the plot way too quickly, which results in the brief lulls intended to build suspense building tedium instead.  The movie also promises us `The Rock,' who appears only in the flashbacks.  Instead, the `contemporary' climax gives us a phony-looking computer generated scorpion with `The Rock's' features.Even with all its shortcomings, `The Mummy Returns' is one heck of a ride, a worthy, if slightly inferior successor to `The Mummy.'",6,0,0,18 June 2001
Avatar," 'A Man Called Avatar'
","While I have read comparisons of Avatar to 'Dances With Wolves' on this website, it's really more of a merging of 'A Man Called Horse' and 'The Return of a Man Called Horse'. While frequently technically amazing, some of the CGI appears downright 'Disneyesque'. Performances are fine, especially Zoe Saldana and Steven Lang.The 'religious right' has called 'Avatar' everything from 'pagan' to 'communist,' the movie is about as controversial as 'The Lion King' or 'Tarzan'. James Cameron has again provided he is the world's most skilled 'techno-director.' James Horner's music is not up to his usual memorable standards, and the musical theme is totally forgettable.I give 'Avatar' an '8'.",8,1,2,8 August 2010
Where Eagles Dare," Lots of Action  So Why is it so Tedious?
","In 1969, Richard Burton was, if not at the height of his career, at least near it.  Clint Eastwood had become America's number one action star. Alistair MacLean was second only to Ian Fleming in writing action-adventure/spy dramas.  His THE GUNS OF NAVARONE had virtually created the film genre and his ICE STATION ZEBRA confounded both the critics and the studio by actually making money after being written off. So, it is understandable that WHERE EAGLES DARE was MGM's most highly anticipated `entertainment' of 1969.  That is, until a ill-conceived ad campaign purporting it as a `spy spoof' resulte in half empty theatres during its first few weeks.  Fortunately for MGM, most first run theatre owners had committed to a certain number of weeks in advance, enabling MGM to revise the ad campaign, and WHERE EAGLES DARE became one of the years big moneymakers.  Not that it deserved it.  MacLean novels are a great read, but they generally translate badly to the screen.  Characterization is not one of MacLean's strong suits, to put it politely.  In order to examine why EAGLES is not the great film GUNS is, one must remember that MacLean did NOT write the screenplay to GUNS.  Veteran writer / producer Carl Foreman did, and Foreman imbued  the characters in GUNS with complexity and tremendous personal conflicts.  One has to care about characters in order to care what happens in a movie.   This is virtually impossible in EAGLES, because the `heroes' as so one-dimensional as to be interchangeable with the `villians.' This is especially a problem with everyone wearing the same uniforms and speaking the same language with the same accents.  Only Darren Nesbitt (who?) makes much of an impression as the efficiently creepy Gestapo Major Von Hapen.Despite the `thrills' and `chills,'  I found WHERE EAGLES DARE to be about as exciting as watching paint dry.  However, in fairness to the movie, I would like to correct a misconception regarding the `anachronism' of using a helicopter to reach `Eagles Nest.'  The film helicopter like the ones we know of today flew in 1939 in Germany (naturally).  The only quibble I would have is that neither Burton nor Eastwood seemed surprised by it.",6,3,14,16 February 2001
Con Air," Con Job
","Lessee, let me get this straight.  Nicholas Cage plays a decorated veteran of the Persian Gulf War.  A Ranger, Cage knows dozens of ways to kill. His first day home, Cage goes to pick up his wife (a luscious Monica Potter), defends himself against three low-lifes, and kills one. Cage is then railroaded into an 8-10 year sentence for involuntary manslaughter (which usually carries about 2-4, most places).  Right, I can see a Southern judge maximum sentencing a decorated veteran with no previous criminal history (or, as the film spells out, a minor one).  But, hey, it gets better.  Cage, a 'model prisoner' is paroled after 8 years (what, no time off for good behaviour?).  Then, catching a Marshall's flight on his way home (why not have the wife come pick you up?) finds himself aboard a aircraft hijacked by 'Cyrus the Virus' (John Malcovitch) and the baddest bunch of baddies this side of the WWF (By the way, is this where the casting director GOT these guys?  The casting is the best thing about the movie; these guys really look like mean 'muthas.'  So far, so good; even though the security seems a bit too lax (compared to, say, U.S. MARSHALLS), there's enough clever action (as well as the known incomptence of federal authorities) to let this quibble pass.  It is, however, at this point the movie gets sappy. CAUTION:  SPOILERS AHEAD Cage gives up the perfect opportunity to get off the plane in order to save a 'friend,' a black con whom is diabetic and will die without his insulin.  This subplot is so condescendingly handled, it plays like a skit borrowed from IN LIVING COLOR. Second, Cage is simply too good at dispatching some really dangerous guys.  Unlike DIE HARD, where the viewer's confidence gradually builds in Bruce Willis, one never doubts Cage can get the job done, no matter how implausible. It gets worse.  When the prison guards find Malcovitch's plans, which he has conveniently left behind, they are blown up by a bomb AFTER they know what he plans to do.  Wouldn't Malcovitch have boobytrapped the OPENING of his little hideaway or destroyed his plans.  Okay, maybe 'Cyrus the Virus' IS that much of an egotist. Then they throw in Steve Buscemi as this movies' Hannibal Lector, build us up with horror stories, then give Buscemi absolutely nothing to do except wisecrack.  What a shame.  Wouldn't it have been wonderful if Buscemi had been allowed to dispatch one of the major baddies? Further, they expect us to believe the DEA 'hardass' (Colm Meaney) whom has believed in 'shoot first ...' during the ENTIRE movie would not shoot down the airplane, when it will likely crash into highly populated Las Vegas with a tremendous loss of life and property.  Ain't gonna happen, folks.Finally, the movies' dispatching of Malcovitch is so 'Rube Goldbergian,' I thought someone had slipped in a couple scenes from BOTH TERMINATOR movies.Good action, performances and a great song (HOW WILL I LIVE WITHOUT YOU?) is not enough.  CON AIR is too manipulative to be believed. CON JOB is more like it.",6,0,0,14 March 2001
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Missed It By That Much
","Although I have always had misgivings about the 'Star Wars' prequels, and felt vindicated by the wretched 'Phantom Menace' and insipid 'Attack of the Clones,' I'd hoped all the hype about 'Revenge of the Sith' was true. Alas, while Lucas succeeded in breaking his slump, 'Sith' is still not in a league with the first three films. The irony is that 'Sith' fails primarily due to John Williams' obtrusive score. There's WAY too much music. It drowns out dialog essential to following the convoluted plot. This is ironical because Williams' original music was a big part of the driving force behind the original 'Star Wars' trilogy.I wished Lucas had saved his effort and made the epilogue films instead of the prequels, since Annakin's character never dominates the proceedings in the way Obiwan's does. Since we know Obiwan doesn't die until 'Star Wars,' this robs the movie of any of its suspense. However, with a toned down score, the movie would merit an '8'. As presently presented, however, it barely musters a '6'.",6,0,2,8 April 2006
Scream," SCREAM? BARF!
","WARNING:  The following is slippery with dripping sarcasm and MAY contain spoilers:Thriller Movies 101:Rule 1. If a major movie actor is listed following `and ' you can be         pretty confident she WON'T be in the sequels. Rule 2. If someone in the top three billings is the second person to be attacked, you can be pretty certain that person will get away and WILL be in the sequels. Rule 3. If the person getting top billing plays a peripheral character, you can be pretty confident he will figure prominently in the climax. Rule 4. If you are going to kill someone in an especially gruesome way, make sure it looks real.   The disembowelment of Drew Barrymore's boyfriend looks especially phony (guts are blue and don't appear attached to the OUTSIDE skin); and, although Drew's corpse looks real, she does NOT appear to have been eviscerated, though the dialogue tells us she was. Drew's sweater would have been shredded and soaked with blood and body fluid..   NOTE TO WES CRAVEN:  Play your movie side by side with any of          the especially `juicy' `X Files' episodes, preferably one involving autopsies or chest popping aliens.  THAT'S how to do it RIGHT, Mr. Craven.A few points to ponder:1. People who live in isolated areas generally have guns and know how to use them, unlike spoiled, snotty, Hollywood actors who can afford bodyguards and abusive boyfriends.2. Would ANYONE, even one with the IQ of a Hollywood actor, race out on a front porch to challenge a threatening stranger without some kind of weapon, ESPECIALLY after two acquaintances have been killed horribly?
3. These days people generally have screened-in windows, even on the second floor, ESPECIALLY fathers with nubile teenage daughters.4. A smart person who manages to get an armed assailant to the ground will kick him in the HEAD (preferably the BACK of the head) as well as in the groin.  Just about anybody kicked ANYWHERE in the head more than once is not likely to get up.  Of course, had our intrepid actors done that, we wouldn't have a movie; and in SCREAM, everyone behaves just as stupidly as he or she would in any other dumb 'splatter' movie.
NOTE TO DREW BARRYMORE:  In 'Scream,' for once, your hair looks great; you should return to that color, style AND hairdresser.  Just as important, you were BORN to wear tight sweaters.  Please do it more often.",4,1,6,7 June 2001
Shrek," Frequently Hilarious But Overrated Nonetheless
","Although frequently hilarious, with some brilliant sendups of Disney and Fairy Tales, the basic storyline of 'Shrek' is routine and predictable.

Tombstone," Exciting AND Historically Accurate ? See the Director's Cut
","In either the theatrical version or the director's cut (VISTA series), 'Tombstone' is an exciting and historically accurate account of the Earp brothers vs. 'the Clanton's'.  Unlike 'My Darling Clementine,' 'Gunfight at the OK Corral' and 'Hour of the Gun,' we get a true pictures of the relationships and fates of the Earp brothers, Doc Holliday, Josephine Marcus, Katie Elder, Curly Bill Brocius, Johnny Ringo (probably) and Ike Clanton.  Moreover, unlike the atrocious 'Wyatt Earp,' we get a suspenseful, actionpacked and COHERENT storyline. We discover 'the Clanton gang' of earlier films was actually a huge gang (over 100) of outlaws known as 'the cowboys.'  We learn that Virgil, not Wyatt is the real instigator behind the 'gunfight at the OK Corral and Wyatt a reluctant participant.'  That gunfight is given its proper perspective rather than being the dominant event in 'Tombstone.'  The male cast is mostly extremely good, particularly Val Kilmer (Holliday), Sam Elliot (Virgil Earp), Powers Boothe (Brocius) and Michael Biehn (Johnny Ringo). Unfortunately, with the notable exception of Joanna Pacula (Kate Elder), the female cast is pretty colorless. Especially disappointing is Dana Delaney as Josephine Marcus. There's nothing flat about Delaney, except her acting here.  One wishes, Joanna Going ('Wyatt Earp') had performed the role in this movie. Nevertheless, it's a mild disappointment in a mostly terrific movie.George P. Cosmatos' director's  cut is a BIG improvement over the original theatrical release.  Although only four minutes longer, his version provides much better context and continuity, particularly during the 'reckoning ' portion. of the movie.  I would give the theatrical version a 'high 7', while the director's cut is clearly a '9'.The VISTA series DVDs comes with a bonus disk with lots of great features and a reproduction map of the OK corral drawn by Wyatt Earp in 1919.  The VISTA series disk is only a couple of dollars more thanthe theatrical version.  It's a must for any collector of great and near great westerns.",9,0,0,3 April 2002
Casino Royale," Technically Polished, Dramatically Bland Prequel
","'Casino Royale,' the only prequel in the long running James Bond series, introduces the sixth actor to play James Bond on screen (discounting the silly 1967 spy spoof of the same name), is technically polished; all it lacks is suspense, mystery and entertainment value. As a rule, I hate prequels, the exceptions being 'The Good, The Bad and The Ugly' and 'Batman Begins;' unfortunately, 'Casino Royale' is no exception. Sure, it's realistic, in the 'Bourne Identity' mold. However, after watching James Bond as 'Superman' all these years, how excited can one get watching two hours of him as 'Clark Kent'? I keep hearing what an 'exceptional' Bond Daniel Craig is, as though my previous misgivings were SO wrong. Well, anyone who had seen Craig in 'Layer Cake' or 'Lara Croft Tomb Raider' knew Craig has the acting chops and action chops to play James Bond. Unfortunately, Craig lacks the spark that has tied all previous James Bond's together (even the morbid Timothy Dalton), and that's empathy. I don't care what happens to Craig's Bond; and, given the very little action in 'Casino Royale,' that's murderous to enjoying the movie. Worse, Craig looks older than his predecessor, Pierce Brosnan. Eva Green's cleavage is the best element of her performance as Vesper; she's not bad, just forgettable, and has little chemistry with Craig.Barbara Brocolli would have better served herself if she'd 'kissed and made up' with Pierce Brosnan, and had 'Casino Royale' rewritten as his swan song. Maybe have a terrorist attack be blamed on Bond's incompetence, and 'M' being forced to retire him after one final 'small potatoes' case. 'Casino Royale' would then have been a story of redemption. Maybe add one final twist as Brosnan's 'Bond' goes off to marry Green's 'Vesper'. Have 'M' reveal that, like 'Bourne,' both the name 'James Bond' and number '007' are assigned (as suggested in the 1967 'Casino Royale'), and that another agent will eventually be assigned the name and number. Now, that might have made an entertaining movie.'Casino Royale' is certainly one of the better made Bond films; however, without a doubt, it's the least entertaining in the series. I feel I have been vindicated in my previous misgivings about Craig; and despite the explosive notices and box office for 'Casino Royale,' I predict Craig's next outing as Bond will be a box office failure. I give 'Casino Royale' a '6'.",6,8,13,29 May 2007
The Sixth Sense," MINIMALIST MASTERPIECE
","Depending upon when you get IT, THE SIXTH SENSE is either: o Somber, episodic and only infrequently scary, or o Gripping, suspenseful, frightening, and surprisingly touching.I think it is the latter. It's also beautifully written, directed and acted.
Because it is so unconventional (More Hitchcock than Spielberg), and uses cinematic elements (lighting, sound, editing) rather than special effects to provide its horror, it is not surprising THE SIXTH SENSE crept into theaters.  What IS surprising is its excellent box office so early in its release cycle.  This once again demonstrates a literate, entertaining film CAN find an audience in these days of megabuck special effects extravaganzas.THE SIX SENSE is the best suspense film since SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.",10,0,0,17 August 1999
Heat," Well-acted, but slow and stupid
","Michael Mann makes great movies (THIEF, THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS) and not-so-great movies (MANHUNTER).  HEAT falls into the latter.  Boasting one extraordinary performance (Robert DeNiro), three terrific ones (Al Pacino, Diane Verona, Amy Brenneman) and one very good one (Ashley Judd), HEAT is, unfortunately, Mann's most poorly paced film.  Much of the problem lay with the stupid script.  The writers would have us believe the 'best' armed robbery team in America would meet in a public restraunt after a multimillion dollar robbery at which guards were murdered, and the leader would exact his frustrations on a team member whom 'screwed up'.  We are to believe that DeNiro would 'cap' a 'screw up' on a public street, when he could have 'done' him in an isolated location. We would believe that an experienced fence would order the 'hit' on DeNiro without researching his team, when DeNiro knows where the fence 'lives?'  We would believe that DeNiro would keep the team together after the 'screw up' escapes, rather than having them disban, track the guy down and 'tie up loose ends?'  This is the dumbest bunch of professional crooks I'VE ever seen.Even the music, usually Mann's trademark, is tired and forgettable.

Cloud Atlas," Ponderous, missed opportunity by the Wachowski's
","Nearly Thirty years ago, Sergio Leone virtually wrote the book on flashback/forward movies with 'Once Upon a Time in America'. Only some unfortunate casting (Elizabeth Perkins) and under-exposition in the second half prevented it from becoming a bonafide masterpiece. Over ten years ago, David Lynch demonstrated its full potential in the near perfect 'Mulholland Drive'. Only an overly extended 'magician's act' and graphic 'love scenes' in the final act diminished its impact. Nearly fifteen years ago, Paul Thomas Anderson demonstrated how such a monumental task could be accomplished with a huge ensemble cast with 'Magnolia'. Only a silly (though historically plausible) deus ex machina marred this fine effort. On the other hand, Cameron Crowe and Steven Soderbergh cautioned us by example of the horrid results of the consequences of how difficult and unsatisfying a flashback/forward movie can be in the wrong hands. Yet, none of these films are nearly as ambitious as 'Cloud Atlas' and the only film that comes close is Josef Rusnak's largely ignored and nearly forgotten 'The Thirteenth Floor'.'Cloud Atlas' spans at least five hundred years between distant past and possible near future, with multiple story lines,styles alternating between farce, melodrama and turgid drama. Worse, 'Cloud Atlas' buries competent, if sometimes uninspiring stars under tons of makeup. Worse, the narrative is so choppy, one hardly has time to know WHERE and WHEN he is, before jumping off to the next time and locale. This makes empathy for the characters nearly impossible. Fortunately, Halle Berry, Ben Whishaw, Jim Sturges,Hugo Weaving and Doona Bae manage to pull it off. Unfortunately, Tom Hanks did not, and herein lies the crux of the problem. Hanks can be a fine actor, but his range is limited; Robert Downey Jr., Russell Crowe or Guy Pearce probably could, though even they would have struggled with that horrible 'pigeon' dialect in the 'after the fall' segment. Hanks alternates between either hammy or unintelligible, effective only when relying on his expressions to tell the story. On the other hand,Halle Berry makes it look easy; of course, Berry is so darned gorgeous that even watching her on screen is a feast for the senses. Bae, on the other hand, is an acquired taste, with her 'porcelain doll' features, though her picture-perfect body is quite a treat. Bae hits all the right notes as Somni-351; unfortunately, this means automatonic mannerisms which undercut hers,and, by extension, the film's message. Fortunately, her chemistry in scenes with both Jim Sturges and Ben Whishaw is tantalizing and this young lady has quite a future in Western cinema if she chooses it.As for the narrative, I could have completely done without the silly 'Timothy Cavendish' segment. A great deal of time is spent on his misadventures, only to be wasted by its overly abrupt insertion into the 'Somni-351' segment. Likewise, I was so distracted by Hank's, Weaving's and Berry's 'pigeon,' in the 'after the fall' segment, I barely understood, let alone cared, about the key points being made.Since reincarnation and spiritual development are so foreign to Western audiences, I am somewhat surprised 'Cloud Atlas' was even made. I can only imagine what brilliant Chinese director Yimou Zhang ('Hero,' 'House of Flying Daggers,' 'Curse of the Golden Flower,')could have done with it.Unfortunately,as it stands, 'Cloud Atlas' is little more than a curiosity and a missed opportunity.I give 'Cloud Atlas' a '6'.",6,1,4,2 July 2013
Gangs of New York," Evil is in the Eye of the Beholder
","Bless Harvey Weinstein's twisted little heart. Once again he has presented us with utterly selfish, dislikable people and produced with them a pretty good story.  I felt pretty unmoved by it all, even if I was never bored. This is largely due to Daniel-Day Lewis' phenomenal performance.I find it mildly amusing that an Italian (Leonard Dicaprio) and a Cuban-Swede (Cameron Diaz) play Irish characters, while Daniel-Day Lewis (an Irishman) plays an Irish-hating American of English descent.A short synopsis. Daniel-Day Lewis plays the heard of the most powerful gang in the 'Five Points' section of New York. He kills Dicaprio father (Liam Neeson) during a gang war between the immigrant Irish and the anti-Irish 'nativists.' It was a 'fair fight,' insofar as Lewis and Neeson had met a formal challenge and Lewis honors Neeson. Nonetheless, 16 years later, Dicaprio plots revenge, becoming Lewis's Lieutenant with a secret plan to kill him during the annual celebration Lewis throws to celebrate and honor Neeson, 'The last interesting man I killed.'There are really no 'good guys' in this movie, but I found myself more in sympathy with Lewis than Dicaprio.  Then, as today, American citizens are victimized by greedy politicians and businessmen capitalizing on immigration. This time, of course, it is illegal immigrants. However, who is to say that the 'legal' immigration of the period wasn't excessive? Certainly, the movie portrays the Irish immigrants as almost entirely composed of thieves, whores and drunkards.While Lewis can be generous and, even, somewhat forgiving, Dicaprio possesses neither of these qualities. With the assistance of 'Boss Tweed' (Jim Broadbent, in another great performance), Dicaprio and his Irish supporters steal a sheriff's election, precipitating much of the climatic violence. Diaz plays a whore and a thief, though she is certainly more unselfish than Dicaprio.Let me compare this, for a moment, with a much better movie, 'Unforgiven'. The moral ambiguity in 'Unforgiven' is clear, in that there are no 'good guys;' but, Eastwood's character is avenging two miscarriages of justice, the whore's mutilation and the murder of his friend under the guise of 'justice'. 'Gangs of New York,' one wonders how New York survived such such predatory and self-destructive people.The movie boasts a good score, excellent period production values and Scorsese's usual masterful camera movements. Nonetheless, only the historical context and Day-Lewis' remarkable performance kept me involved enough to finish 'Gangs of New York.'",7,1,1,5 December 2003
Gladiator," I Come to Bury ...
","I wanted to like GLADIATOR, I really did.  My sister said it was a great movie, and I really wanted to please my sister.  But I can't, you see, because GLADIATOR is not a great movie.  In fact, GLADIATOR is not even a particularly good movie.GLADIATOR is ineptly directed by  Ridley Scott; no two ways about it.  What else can explain keeping scenes in which the otherwise competent Russell Crowe lets his Australian accent slip through?  What else Can explain allowing leading lady Connie Nielson sleepwalk through her performance for two thirds of the Movie?  What else can explain carefully crafting a subplot involving a German Shepherd dog, then abruptly dropping it?  The ineptitude goes on and on.  The lack of chemistry between Crowe and Nielson is bad enough without further undercutting it with obtrusive, inappropriate music in early key scenes.  High- and low-key cinematography is intermixed without any concern for dramatic appropriateness.  It is almost as though Scott said, `Cloudy day? No problem, the audience won't notice.'  And lets talk about this cinematography.  Many of the low-key interiors with Joaqin Phoenix and Connie Nielson are so poorly lit, you cannot see Phoenix's eyes!  Poor Phoenix, probably the least experienced of the leads, has the toughest role.  Despite what you may hear, Phoenix does pretty well, despite Scott's undercutting.  ACTION FANS BE WARNED. Scott shoots ALL the action scenes without benefit of long shot (for perspective) and with computer generated and slow-motion action.  Think widescreen movie being shown in television (3:4) format.  Expect to be more confused than entertained.There IS plenty to like in GLADIATOR.  The late Oliver Reed as the gladiator owner is magnificent.  Richard Harris is very good as Marcus Aurelius. Djimon Hounsu, Derek Jacobi, David Schofield, Sven Ole-Thorsen and, especially,  Spencer Treat Clark (Lucius) are all fine in supporting roles. Savor them if you must see GLADIATOR.",5,0,1,26 June 2000
Contact," Close, But No 'Contact'
","CONTACT is a beautifly crafted, but ultimately comprimised movie. Are we to believe a 'rational agnostic' scientist and a 'holy man' jump into bed together the first night they meet, then don't see each other for years?  OK, guess it does happen in real life, but the whole thing is quite jarring, and it certainly undercuts the 'holy man's' role as a spokesman for the religious later. The theme of this movie is, pardon the pun, alienation.  Foster's character has let no one get really close to her since the sudden death of her father.  Losing both her mother and father in childhood makes her fear caring too much, or really believing in anything. Yet Foster WANTS to believe.  She risks losing her reputation in order to seek contact with an alien civilization.  Does she succeed?SPOILERS AHEADOf course; but this disappointing movie tries to have it BOTH ways. Foster claims to have been gone 13 hours, when the external evidence indicates she did not leave at all.  'Scuse me, Jody, where did you come up with that number?  Did Robert Zemeckis leave something on the cutting room floor that makes sense of it?  Of course, when the National Science Advisor finds that the Foster's digital video camera has operated for 13 HOURS, that's supposed to satisfy us.  CHEAT!There is plenty of evidence out there which 'proves' BOTH science and religion.  If you doubt that, read something like GOD AND THE NEW PHYSICS. To quote Einstein 'Religion without science is blind; science without religion is lame...'  CONTACT is both.",7,0,2,3 January 2001
Hustle & Flow," The roots of 'Empire'.
","My wife and I are HUGE of 'Empire'. So, imagine when I discovered two of my favorite actors, Terrence Howard ('Lucius') and Taraji P. Henson ('Cookie') had appeared together 10 years earlier in a similarly-themed movie about hip-hop. Unfortunately, while 'Empire' is consistently entertaining, 'Hustle & Flow' builds slowly and unpleasantly. While Terrence Howard's 'Djay' is an earlier incarnation of 'Lucius,' Taraji P. Henson's 'Shug' appears mentally-challenged. Worse, the two characters responsible most for the outcome are white. Also, the scene where 'Shug' gives 'Djay' comes out of nowhere. Just WHERE did the very-pregnant 'Shug' get the money to give 'Djay' this VERY expensive gift? Not to mention, the Oscar-winning song, 'Its hard out there for a pimp' is not as good as the original song created for 'Empire'; and it pretty much the only song in the movie.I fear many of those who see the reviews and awards for 'Hustle & Flow' are going to be as disappointed as my wife. I liked 'Hustle & Flow' for its raw honesty. However I resent the 'tools' given to white racists who will watch 'Hustle & Flow' and say, 'See?' I give 'Hustle & Flow' a '6'.",Null,0,0,7 March 2015
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," 'The Odyssey' by Homer...and Jethro
","After a year of frustrating disappointments ('Gladiator,' 'Traffic,' 'Erin Brockovitch,' 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon') I FINALLY get to see a movie a movie WORTHY to be best picture. It figures the Academy wouldn't even nominate it.This is a TERRIFIC recreation of an era, every bit as impressive as 'Titanic' and 'LA Confidential'.  Even better, this is laugh out loud funny'.  Very loosely based on 'The Odyssey' by Homer, this story of three dim bulb convicts escaping a chain gang to recover a 'treasure' in Depression-era Mississippi boasts terrific performances, great production values and much good humor.  Most outstanding is George Clooney (!!!???) as Ulysses.  Ulysses talks 'smart,' but he is every bit as thick as his partners.  He is the perfect example of 'starting with an incorrect premise and using perfect logic and reason to come to an incorrect conclusion.'  Clooney well deserves his Golden Globe award and should have received an Oscar.The Coen Brothers have a terrific talent for taking unfilmable material and making great movies.  This movie seems closest in spirit to their near masterpiece, 'Raising Arizona,' another live action feature length cartoon which was never tiring.  Part of the Coens's brilliance is that they can brutally satirize their characters and communities without being condescending.  They have retold 'The Odyssey' if it were told by the classically great country comedy team Homer and Jethro. This is a movie to be enjoyed through repeat viewings, far and away the best film of 2001.",10,0,0,2 July 2001
