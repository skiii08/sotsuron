The Avengers," The best Marvel Movie in ages !!!!!!
","In a nutshell: The Avengers is a high standard movie which took a prodction time of 2 and half years. The Viewer will follow the earth mightest heroes on their Quest vs the antagonist Loki and his army of aliens who want to capture the earth. However they underestimate the power of the super heroes and have to battle first. The Characters are really good and show their own individual purposes why they are fighting against the injustice. Of course the are many problems when you are put in a group of other guy who are as epic as you. So the viewer will see how the character will go trough their confrontations with the others. But they can only win if they work in a team which happens in the climax.... To Sum it up : SFX 10/10Character design : 10/10Story: 7/10Screenplay and acting style : 10/10Extra Points : (Very nice placed humor) 9/10TOTAL : 9,2",10,2,5,28 April 2012

BAH i really was disappointed cause i expected some BAD GUYS and some more special effects CAUSE THEY WERE IN A ******* DREAM in other words the move is awful its waste of time and the money in to worth it",1,53,101,8 February 2011
