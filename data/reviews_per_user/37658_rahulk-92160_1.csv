Vertigo," More psychological than thriller
","The movie is great, In terms of story line and screenplay it's captivating. You just like lead character are hooked in a way that doesn't allow to get off.It's a slow suspenseful thriller where of course the thriller though solid and pulls the right punches still doesn't altogether surprises you mainly because we have seen hell amount of suspense thriller and kind of know that things aren't what they look.But here thriller to me was less for how or what happened and more was for what will happen. Movie has good meat left even after the surprise or twist is revealed. This makes it altogether and pleasantly different than other psychological thrillers.You would have to appreciate the legendary director for this masterpiece, the background score, the use of colors, the sombre evening scenes and overall direction is unmissable.I was really intrigued by the lead actress Kim Novak, She is beautiful, mysterious, innocent and confused at times and you would want to see more of her. She looks like someone for whom someone would lose his mind. Her persona is just so strong.In all honesty I didn't expect the ending as it turns out but then have no qualms since it succeeded in surprising me.I think it's a must watch movie but imo it must be watched alone to absorb it totally.",10,1,2,28 August 2019
