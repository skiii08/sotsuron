The Blair Witch Project," Quite A Chilling Experience
","I believe a scary movie, can only be effective once. You never know what's going to happen next, your at the edge of your seat, staring off into the darkness to see whats lurking there, this movie mastered that. Once your drawn in, it doesn't let you go. I personally, was drawn in entirely, I felt like I was actually there with them the entire time, thus is why the movie was incredibly effective to me. The actual story in the movie surrounding the legend is creepy as hell. Children are vanishing, one by one until they are eventually found butchered inside a secluded house deep in the woods. Killed by a deranged man telling everyone an old woman ghost told him to kill them all. The little girl disappearing for days, then returning babbling about an old woman who's feet never touched the ground. The whole making one kid face into the corner while he killed the other, then killing the one in the corner. That definitely stuck in my mind until the end. When Mike says, 'Its a house.' nearing the end, I began to tense up. Imagining myself in that situation is absolutely terrifying. Out in the middle of nowhere, in a forest in pitch black, your friend is yelling for help and you stubble upon a house...Jesus. When the girl descends down into the dark, scary as hell, cellar, that moment she turns and you see Mike in the corner, that moment was extremely terrifying and effective. The fact thats what that murderer would do, and he was caught and executed years ago, so he's out of the question...just gave me a flood of chills. Its just scary, there's no other words I can think of. I can only picture what else was in that room. That other kid butchered on the floor? The 'Blair Witch'? Yeesh, it just scares me.The fact you don't see anything is the exact reason why this movie scared the crap out of me. Im going to say what a lot of other people have already said, it did was Jaws did for going into the water and what Psycho did for taking a shower. Not only dark forests, but just staring into darkness scares me because of this movie. No other movie has scared me the way this one has. Like I said once you've seen it, thats it. Its only effective once, but hell, its powerful. This movie was a frightening experience, and I loved it. I can safely say, this movie is definitely one of my favourites. I just really really hope I don't fall asleep one night, and I end up dreaming up being in any situation resembling The Blair Witch Project.",9,2,4,4 November 2007
