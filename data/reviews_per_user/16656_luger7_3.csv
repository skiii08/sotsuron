Iron Man 3," Well, i don't care what nerds say...
","I don't know what is all this rage about. It's just a fricking superhero movie. Maybe because I am neither a hardcore Iron Man follower nor I have tons of comics, I just enjoyed this movie like someone who likes sci-fi and fantasy movies. Well, what can i say? I loved the first movie, but for some reason the second one bored me the hell out of me and I really wanted to like it; now this third movie has accomplished its mission: it has entertained me. Of course I know some background info about Iron Man thanks to some comics and cartoons of my childhood, so when I watched this crazy twist about Mandarin, I said: whaaaaaaat???? This is.... just.....ridiculous, but also BRILLIANT! Why not? really, why not? I know this was a delusion for hardcore fans and angry nerds, but for this movie , it worked perfectly. Another apparently hated point is that this movie focus a lot more on Tony Stark and not only on Iron Man... well, I hate to say it but this is for me another strong point. Are there loopholes? of course there are! But hey what movie doesn't have any? This is not an artsy fancy movie or Oscar movie, it's just an action flick that just happens to have a superhero. If you just want action, fun, good fx and entertainment, don't hesitate and watch it.PD. I dunno but sometimes I wonder why suddenly there's a wave of bad or good reviews in IMDb in some 'nerdy' films, it seems only 10 persons are writing tons of them...just saying..",8,3,7,29 August 2013
Alexander," Good..but...
","It's not a bad movie, that would be unfair, but it's not the excellent movie either, at least not what i was expecting of.... first of all COLLIN FERREL??? my god! tinted hair??? well, aren't there any good blond actors? and Angelina Jolie as his mother??? she looks as young as Alexander and She's an awful actress....besides, well, yes in ancient world bisexuality was not a bad thing, but why focus so much on that?? why? Alexander had a big interesting life, more than that...there were so many life passages that Stone doesn't even touch so i think gay community was very pleased.............. Battle scenes, Kilmer and Hopkins (as usual) are the remarkable thing...",7,0,5,26 January 2006
Caddyshack," Not bad but not good
","Well, well, well, finally the time has come and I've watched this so acclaimed comedy. First of all I consider myself a Bill Murray fan, I've enjoyed somewhat Chavy Chase and Roger Dangerfield's work, so the fact I had never watched Caddyshack until now was becoming a sense of guilt. Damn, I had read reviews saying this is one of the best comedies of the eighties. So, after watching Caddyshack I only could shake my head and tried to understand how this can be one of the funniest movies ever. I can't make heads or tails of this film, I mean, it feels like it was made of different sketches with no solid or unified script,and full of wasted actors (Bill Murray is like useless) or plain bad acting (Chavy Chase), gratuitous nudity (ok, eighties comedy I know) and a terrible pacing. Nonetheless I can't say this is the worst movie I've ever seen, it's enjoyable till certain point, but in no way this is one of the best comedies around.",6,5,9,29 November 2015
