","James Stewart is 'Scottie' a serious detective who's scared of heights but not afraid to follow a client's blond wife Madeleine(Kim Novak) around San Francisco.Scottie and the audience only focused on poor Madeleine,we notice that he only speaks to her after he saves her from drowning.The film will surprise us with a more twisted subject: Madeleine is out of the picture,Scottie is devastated but he sees a woman,Judy(a brunet Novak again) Who resembles the dead female.Our poor detective is so obsess by her that he even makes her over as  Madeleine.There's a plot a little unrealistic(a murder plan)and some questionÂ… in the open scene of Vertigo we see Scottie left hanging by the  fingers in a roof.How he get down from that?.In the next scene we only see him using a cane?.Vertigo works  because Scottie is  profound and complex it deals with obsession;manipulation; fear and most of all 'guilty'.This fellow Scottie is a tortured man.Maybe Madeleine represents 'an ideal woman' as all Hitchcock blonde actresses: Madeleine Carrol;Joan Fontaine;Marlene Dietrich;Doris Day; Tippi Heddren and Hitch's Favorite 'Grace Kelly'.Donald Spoto amazing book'the Dark side of Genius' suggests that Scottie resembles the director's obsession for actresses and turn them into blond goddesses.Hitch work out his sexual fantasies on films.This one is particular fascinating and disturbing as all men's mind. 8/10",8,2,3,25 April 2002

E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," An E.T. with golden eggs
","Steven Spielberg recent film 'A.I' was a total failure,so, he decides to re-release E.T. again only to earn/gain more money(and increase his big ego).You guys will buy everything that say a film 'directed by Spielberg'.AH! new scenes? give me a break!

Chinatown," one of my favorite
","What happened to your nose Gittes? Somebody slam a bedroom window on it?Gittes: Nope,your wife got excited.She crossed her legs a little to quick. You understand what a mean pal?-
Jake Gittes(Jack Nicholson in a memorable role) is a private detective in the late 30s This hero is a loner,righteous and witty,nothing seem to surprise him anymore but he is also a moralist who suffers in a perverse world. In one scene Gittes must defend his profession to another man saying that his job is honest and he's helping desperate people(Gittes specializes in investigations involving divorces and extra-marital affairs).The plot in Chinatown is complex,with sub-plots(the water scandal;a mysterious murder;a powerful old man and his daughter). Evelyn Mulwray(Faye Dunaway) appears and the mystery begins,Gittes is so intrigue and obsess by her that he needs to find out the true, is she a manipulator or a victim? She acts with ambiguity ;why is she so scared Of her father?.One of the must powerful scene is when Evelyn tell the truth to Gittes she confessed the identity of  the young girl:'she is my sister and my daughter! my father and I,'. The real plot in Chinatown is corruption in every aspects; is about the burden of a woman and her horrible secret.The true villain,Noah Cross(a superb John Huston)is a deceiver,perverse, powerful and even charismatic(hey!,Hitler was too)he is the epitome of evil.Chinatown has one of the must uncomfortable and unfair ending in cinema history,but in this case this ending was necessary and realistic(bad things happen to good people). Sometimes `the good' lost and evil cannot be eradicated; -'forget it Jake it's Chinatown'! - and it could has been anywhere anyplaceSad Sad Sad.",10,2,4,28 February 2002
Fight Club," misunderstood?
","You can force it but it will not come.you can taste it but it will not form.you can crush it but it's always here.you can crush it but it's always near chasing you home saying everything is broken everyone is broken.you can force it but it will stay stung. you can crush it as dry as a bone.you can walk it home straight from school.you can kiss it.you can break all the rules but still everything is broken,everyone is broken.why can't you forget it?I considered the being whom I had cast among mankind, and endowed with the will and power to effect purposes of horror, such as the deed which he had now done, nearly in the light of my own vampire, my own spirit let loose from the grave, and forced to destroy all that was dear to me.

The Others," oh it gets dark,it gets lonely on the other side from you...
","I saw this movie last night here in Asunción,and the audience really got scared!,some of them jump from their seat and scream!, Iloved the eerie claustrophobic atmosphere in the film...this is a very stylish,very classy picture...Nicole Kidman restraint performance is just wonderful, she goes from opposite poles: some times rigid and histerical,other times delicate and emotional,she  breaks like a porcelain doll,oh well, maybe because she is impossible beautiful like Catherine Deneuve in 'Repulsion'(maybe Amenábar saw this film),but Nicole looks like Grace KELLY, IT WAS NOT A COINCIDENCE that her name in the film is 'Grace'.If actresses like Julia Roberts and Gwyneth Paltrow won Oscars maybe such a'corny award' is not made for a REAl talented actress, then Nicole has little chance next March...if she is understimated from the academy WE SHOULD LOVE HER MORE! right?,and that girl who play her daughter 'anne'(Alakina Mann)in the film,she is magnificent!,when she appears we forget that boy who saw 'dead people'. Definitly 'the Others'is a great 'ghost movie',like in literature Wuthering Heights represents a great gothic/tragical story...it echoes Kate BUSH when she sings ' Heathcliff,it's me, Cathy come home I`m so cold,let in-a-your window'...that break our hearts.",Null,0,0,7 January 2002
Sleepy Hollow," Burton did it again
",I just wanna to say I thought 'The tree of the dead'is the most coolest of the movie.I loved all the Gothic aspects of the film it has the best of Tim Burton it is like 'Nightmare before Christmas'.The story works as an ancient ghost tale like the one we heard from childhood.It's so great and creepy the moment the headless horseman appears in that eerie forest.I also find shocking the scene where he kills that young family.The best sequence of the movie is of course when the horseman disappears mysteriously by getting inside that creepy tree.I'm so in love of Johnny Depp(I enjoyed all his films except the awful 'the astronauts wife')He shows in Sleepy Hollow that he can be a great comedian and once again he proves he looks handsome in period costumes!.Notice Chris Walken ugly teeth...he is the most beautiful 'dead man' I'd ever seen(I'm joking!!!!),Null,0,1,28 March 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," One ring to rule!
","I want to tell something to the people who think that Jackson's movie is a little different from the book, OF COURSE IT WILL BE!,he said that he made this film to please himself,not the Tolkien fans!,P.J. is an interesting filmaker,FOTR is his own vision,his personal/artistic hallmark(like Kubrick,Hitchcock,Polanski),if you want a movie that is a'copy' from the book, go and see Harry Potter.",Null,0,0,9 January 2002
American Beauty," The Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder
","This film American Beauty has this quality it leaves you with bittersweet in your mouth like when someone tell you a truth you dont want to hear.Kevin Spacey is Lester Burnham,in the beginning of the film He speaks to us(in off)and present us his world,'An alien place' to him, though he has the option to save himself,Lester warn us that he would die at the end,and for that we dont need a 'SPOILER' because when he says this we already forgot it.Lester wish to become Human again,He hates the 'Vanity' of his wife and hates  the American society status of sex and money,so, He decided to be young again,Lester wants to be a teenager again to free himself of the burden of a Responsible life,to feel things again,He has a crush on a cheerleader(got it?) a young blond of sixteen who is his daughter's best friend,Red Roses  appears almost as a fetish,if Lester is young again he starts to figure it out things.Lester teenage daughter'Jane'(Thora Birch) 'is always angry' He said, and Lester wish he could tell her that this is only a phase but He doesn't want to lie.Ricky Fitts(West Bentley in a interesting role)seems to be the adult of the film even if he's only 18,His father is a pathetic strict man full of prejudices,Ricky is intense and he films with a camera what he thinks  is beautiful (He really has an unique view of what beauty is),Ricky maybe symbolizes the role of a Film Director and his capacity to touch people(audience) through images and as an Artist Ricky  is complex, and sees the world different,almost spiritual.Now I got to comment the final scene so, SPOILER AHEAD,When we see Kevin Spacey dead and we notice his eyes full open(he seems to be smiling),Ricky Looks at him closely and then smiles at him,he realizesthat Lester did not die with a heartache,He re-define what Marguerite Yourcenar once said:'To face the death with eyes open'and that's poetry!",Null,0,0,5 April 2002
Saving Private Ryan," I love to hate Spielberg
","In 'Saving Private ryan' the characters are so stereotyped('the brave'; 'the cute';'the rebel';the timid')that the critics and audience should be ashamed of.Why we should forgive the director's mistakes just because he is 'Steven Spielberg'?even some of the gruesome scenes of the film seem stolen from a real war documentary,SPR is a lot more inferior than the deep'The thin red line' and to give every award of the planet to Spielberg is just ridiculous and childish,you just make him more spoiled and rich!.",5,3,5,30 January 2002
Saving Private Ryan," John Miller has no personality?
","The American people think that SPR is an excellent film but the real European who are more educated than you guys, are right in saying that this `war film' is mediocre.The best war films are from renegade 'real artists', Filmmakers(not like Spiel- who?) like  FF Coppola(Apocalypse Now) or Terence Malick. If you feel `superior' because you live in The United States  you should see`We Were Soldiers' it portraits `how brave' the American soldiers were.I bet you will cry!!!. 5/10",5,0,1,15 April 2002
The Pianist," Pure Sensibility

Schindler's List," Why can't we see good German people?
","I dont know but I just can't call `Schindler's list' a Masterpiece.To me is more like a   Documentary for Jews. I can't wait to see the film `The Pianist' based on the wonderful and - more close to reality Â– book by the Polish Pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman(an Holocaust surviver) , Szpilman also recounted the deplorable actions Jews and Poles were driven to in order to survive.

2001: A Space Odyssey," 2001 The best year in Cinema History
","I've read some of your comments here and I realized that there's two kind of opinions:The honest one and reviews from disdainful angry people( comments of RSura or Da Reel Nick Carter- see below-).If you don't like this movie I can accept that.BUT I can't accept comments like' this movie is bad or boring' GIVE ME something more clever than that!!!.Don't attack(on)the Filmmaker and his work!.I say it again '2001' is worth watching it,like BLADE RUNNER,it makes you'wonder' and that is a great quality (and legacy) for a film. Those who think this film is Boring,maybe you are this Arrogant unbearable Star Wars freak fans or 'Paulettes'(fans of the old witch critic Pauline Kael).Long Live 2001!!!.'When you think of the greatest moments of film,I think you are almost always involved with images rather than scenes,and certainly never dialogue.The thing a film does best is to use pictures with music and I think these are the moments you remember.Another thing is the way an actor did something: the way Emil Jannings took out his handkerchief and blew his nose in The Blue Angel,or those marvelous slow turns that,Nikolai Cherkassov did in Ivan The Terrible'. --Stanley Kubrick--Note: IMDB reviewers are like the Mafia ,they only kill each others.",Null,0,3,28 April 2002
2001: A Space Odyssey," A Star is born
","A Space for the ImaginationWhen I first saw 2001 I thought the baby(o star child)at the end of the film REPRESENTED a new world or planet but sadly I've read so many essays and articles about this film that in a way influenced my personal opinion.Maybe the person who called 2001'a film without message' was right,maybe it means nothing:The Black Monolith,so solemn almost mystical is like a crucifix hanging on walls in christian homes as a mighty object but really,don't mean a thing.I dismissed the religious theories because Kubrick was an 'Atheistic' and I dont see him doing 'A God's tale';or philosophical interpretations either.I take 2001 Space Odyssey for what it is 'an astonishing visual film(the beauty of it).The astronaut David Bowman finished an unconcluded mission'alone',his partner dies(he seems to be his twin brother or something)Bowman disconnects HAL 9000(the computer)after that he submerges himself in'Jupiter and Beyond' with flood of colors,forms and surreal landscapes,our eyes are wide open as Bowman,his distorted face is shocking,we see more lights and masses this become A Personal Odyssey maybe 'mental',into subconscious?.The Big Question:is the baby/fetus an E.T? OR MAYBE A New Man,DISCONNECTED from technology(the weapons),the truth is more close to NIETZSCHE,we dont know but... who cares?.2001 it's great and controversial I liked the ambiguity,maybe that was Kubrick intention to  incentive the audience to think for themselves.My Opinion maybe is wrong but that's not the point,if I THOUGHT the star child was a planet maybe it is not far from the truth,somebody said:'A Head/mind is a world'.AH!

Three Colors: Blue," Bleu A Symphony of Grief
","The subject(mourn,lost)is so interesting and profound that this film is a real treasure. It is very difficult to write about 'Bleu' because this film has so many intense scenes,with many details.Juliette  Binoche's vulnerability is in every scene, every gesture, every moment. She plays an enigmatic woman,'Julie,' we're witness to her terrible loss(her husband who was a famous composer and her daughter died in a car crash)She is the survivor,not only of the accident,but of herself too.The film doesn't show us how her life was before the tragedy,but' Bleu' focuses on her personal journey to healing. Julie seems stoic,she did not criy hysterically or stay in bed totally depressed,her grief is intimate and touching.In one scene when Julie is near the blue crystal mobile(which belonged to her daughter) just notice her reaction.Another poignant scene is when Julie is in that swimming pool,suddenly,she stops and she can hear her husband's symphony(all in her head). Bleu also approaches a philosophical question-when you lose everything  can you start all over again?,life is a series of events and choices,Julie moves to another place from the country to a city.She did not want to see her friends,she wants to be alone but is this possible?,her past will haunt her. Another interesting aspect of this film is the use of music instead of dialogue,her silence is a reference of her terrible loss and pain,she is not depressed but sad. Also the meaning of the unfinished symphony of her husband is very profound (is connected with her grief and healing) The photography of the film and the beautiful and delicate face of Binoche contribute to the impact of  BLEU. Kieslowski was one of the most talented directors, I really admired his 'Trois couleurs' trilogy but I think,'Bleu' was his most powerful film.10/10",10,84,114,13 March 2002
Psycho," `What are you running away from?'
","Imagine you are running for a bad reason.While you're driving the car,your mind figure it out situations.You know you did wrong and that remorse haunts you.Outside: it's rainy night.Take a detour.Off the main road Our Protagonist sees `Bates Motel Vacancy'.She will spent the night there and the caretaker Norman Bates will become your own Executioner!.You won't live to tell the story!!!.Marion begins to reconsiders.She plans to repent,redeem herself and return the money.Her repentance is her punishment(later we see the famous `shower/murder' scene).This film has so many great scenes.My favorite one is Their long conversation over Marion's dinner in the 'parlor' under the watchful eyes of Norman's birds Norman at first wins our confidence by making embarrassing revelations about himself - 'A hobby should pass the time, not fill it'; and, much more surprisingly, 'A son is a poor substitute for a lover.' But his anger over Marion's suggestion that he have Mother committed, an anger that seems to grow with its expression, almost without limit, is frightening.Marion's 'good night' to Norman are the last words she will ever speak, and the last words we will hear for the next 16 minutes (other than Norman's 'Oh, God, Mother! Blood! Blood!). Another great one is the last scene(little spoiler) We then get our final glimpse of Norman, staring helplessly, while Mother gives us her side of the story through the voice over. She finishes by saying that she's just going to sit here like the harmless old lady she is. Suddenly, the focus returns to Norman's eyes. He looks right at us and grins menacingly If you enjoyed this Masterpiece I recommend you another Hitchcock film'The Lodger'.In appearance, Norman is surprisingly reminiscent of the (very) young Gregory Peck of Spellbound (1945), Norman is play by Anthony Perkins.The Gothic Style victorian house behind the motel on a hill is exactly like the Edward Hopper's painting 'The House by the Railroad'. 9/10",Null,0,0,30 April 2002
Rosemary's Baby," A perfect film to watch on good Friday or Christmas
","ALL OF THEM WITCHES!!!!(minor Spoilers baby!)A friend of mine told me that `Rosemary' is  like a `catholic heroine'? I totally disagree with him,Rose represents more like a `Sacrifice' To me She agrees to be with her baby no matter what;as a mother of a Murderer would say that she still loves her son.The highlight/climax in the movie is when she is nearer the black cradle (with an inverted cross hanging above) and sees her baby and says loudly: `What have you done to its eyes?,they tells her -`he has his father's eyes- Rose says: What are you talking about? Guy's eyes are normal! What have you done to him YOU MANIACS!!!.Even if the child is ugly or deformed a real mother would love him anyway, right? But I have just one complaint about this sceneI want to see the baby!!!.Why can't we See the little b*****d?Other aspects of the film that I enjoyed :1- The Dakota Apartment where this movie was shot(on Upper West side in Manhattan)is the most gorgeous building I'd ever seen besides Notre Dame of Paris.2-Anton LaVey as Satan?  this maybe was his dream come true(ha ha !)3-The `Anagram' scene was  cool(she retrieves a scrabble board game and uses the game letters to spell out the name of the book ALL OF THEM WITCHES)4-Christopher Komeda music score,what a marvelous composer he was.Rosemary's Baby was his last collaboration in `a Polanski film',before his tragic death.` No Pope ever visits a city where the newspapers are on strike.'And I STILL PRAYING FOR ROSEMARY'S BABY!!!.

A Hard Day's Night," Pick up your favorite Beatle and run!
","I saw HDN on the big screen last year and it was a great experience,I'm 26 years old ,so, i was not aware of the furor they caused,HDN not only makes you witness the crazy joy the Beatles provoked,but also makes you part of it;when the film begins with that wonderful'Hard day's 'song I almost jump from my seat,what a energy!.HDN is more a documentary;they don't act,they are playing themselves(four mischievous guys),they look fresh and natural,this is also about personality,not arrogance,(remember 'the sex pistols'and how they treat reporters,bragging and bragging!) The Beatles handle the press with humor,they know how to play their game,when a female tv reporter asked Ringo if he is a 'mod or a rocker' he answered'I'm a Mocker',that's clever and funny!,but when it is time to play music they are very professional,we hear great songs like'Can't buy me love';I should have known better'; 'And I love her'.Stanley Kauffmann said that 'the four of them seem rarely to walk;they often hardly seem to touch the ground';maybe because they don't had other choice than to escape from the crowd!.",Null,0,0,19 January 2002

Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," Haunting
","A Vampire who wanders in eternity.Louis(Mr Pitt) seems more a doomed immortal man.He hates his condition.This kind of vampire reminds me of the angels in the German film 'Wings of Desire',we should call it 'fangs undesire'.Louis is in constant company with a young ambiguous girl,played by Kirsten Dunst and she was brilliant,all that professionalism in that short age(she was only 11)and then she appears in 'The Virgin Suicides',one of the greatest film of 1999.Dunst became a cult actress with honors,this year she impressed me again in The Cat's Meow,I think this is her first role as a woman,maybe she could transcends(as Jodi or Kinski did) to a more grown up actress without losing her charm.Ah! Kirsten is a lucky girl too Did you know that her first kiss on screen was with Brad Pitt? yes,in interview with the Vampire.Kirsten was blessed from the start!.",Null,1,2,13 May 2002
