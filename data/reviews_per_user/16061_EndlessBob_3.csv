Antz," Double pun in the title?
","I don't really have an analysis of the film to add, except to say that I really enjoyed it. Instead, I'd like to comment on the double pun (or perhaps just a triple meaning) within the title itself.'Antz' can be looked at in three ways: a cute misspelling of the plural of 'Ant'; a statement of the name of the protagonist, 'Ant Z'; and a description of how he felt about his place in society, 'Ant-z' (antsy).I don't know that the writers meant this, but it seems too improbable to be just a coincidence. Fodder for a film class debate, I suppose.",Null,0,1,3 November 2004
Van Helsing," Have you all forgotten the classic Hammer Films movies?
","This movie is what Hammer Films would be doing today if they were still making their stylish horror movies of the '70s. Hammer never saw a Dracula script they didn't like; and while Jackman and Roxburgh aren't Cushing and Lee, they did a good job of revisiting the stylish romps that were Hammer's forte.Actually, I think that Roxburgh did a better job of revisiting Dracula as the stylish sexpot vampire than Jackman did with Van Helsing's usually staid, intellectual vampire hunter -- but given the modern taste for physical action over cerebral matchups, it's understandable that there's more room to 'give' in the Van Helsing character.If you'd like to see a new twist on the Dracula legend, with some pretty good CG to fill in the special effects in a way that Hammer could only dream of, then give this movie a watch.Personally, I'd like to see another pairing of Jackman and Roxburgh -- after all, as many times as Peter Cushing did in Christopher Lee, Dracula always found a way to return again.",Null,2,4,21 November 2004
Moon," Bad science ruins this movie
","Bad science ruins this film.First off, the clones. Unless clones and the supporting technology are ridiculously cheap, why would it be more cost-effective to keep an army of clones in reserve rather than put more people on the moon to take care of the base and each other? Previous hard SF treatments of industrial work in outer space always depended on the eccentricities of people to find those who were willing to work in extreme environments for long periods of time. Robert Heinlen was famous for his 'space hardhat' individuals like 'The Green Hills of Earth''s Rhysling and the construction workers in 'Delilah and the Space Riggers.' J. T. McIntosh's 'Hallucination Orbit' even goes so far as to put men in orbit around Pluto for up to seven years, figuring they'd do it for the money even knowing the dangers of such isolation.This screenplay treats humans as so vulnerable that a three-year stint only light-seconds from Earth is beyond their capacity, and so expendable that the corporation is willing to kill someone every three years rather than spend the money to replace them via ship or just have a few more people around. If the technology exists to fuse He-3 and create clones with implanted memories, why wouldn't it be a simple matter to just replace a crew every few months? What about the original Sam Bell? Why would he be willing to let copies of himself be killed every three years? Rather than a study of what makes a human being, this is more a representation of what happens when human life becomes cheap. Do the clones have no rights? Does Earth even know about this process? Apparently not, given the voice-overs at the end of the movie, which makes one wonder why the corporation is wasting this technology to produce throwaway superintendents rather than getting rich in the medical line.At only one point did the movie engage my emotions, and that was when clone-Sam-1 had the conversation with 'his' teenage daughter and realized that his whole life had just been stolen from him. Maybe if the script had dealt with a few of these side issues, and then focused on how people would truly behave to discover that their lives were a fraud and of no worth, then perhaps we would have had a great film.Instead, we are left with a superficial treatment that might have made a good 30 minute 'Twilight Zone' episode.",4,36,77,19 October 2010
