Hereditary," Perfect mix of mystery and tension
","It feels so refreshing to watch a modern horror film and actually feel scared! Hereditary has a slow build up of tension with very few jump scares, loud noises, or typical modern horror tropes, and the final act is so much more satisfying because of it.
Also, the underlying mystery in this film is brilliant, I was guessing all the way through, and the final reveal made the ending, for me at least, a satisfying one. However, I can see some disliking the ending as it is a bit ambiguous, I still have unanswered questions.
Overall though I couldn't recommend this film more to horror fans, it's awesome.",10,1,3,17 January 2019
