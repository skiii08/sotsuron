Catch Me If You Can," a great movie
","I have just seen this movie and it was a very entertaining experience.The best thing about this movie (which is easy to overlook) is that although Frank is a cheat and a criminal in every sense of the word, we sympathise with him and want him to be more deceitful. We want to consciously overlook the moral bankruptcy. That is honestly how good the script and direction are.The presentaion of the 60's is realistic and engaging. There are a few occasions where you think that Frank's 'heroics' are somewhat exaggerated but perhaps it is understandable because he was a master con man. Di Caprio does not look 16 when he is portrayed as 16, but I guess you can't make someone aged 30+ appear that young no matter how hard you try! I did not like Di Caprio before I saw this movie but my perception of his talent has completely changed. He gives a spell bounding performance. In fact I don't think any other actor would have bettered his performance. He completely looks the character and portrays many different expressions with flawless expertise. Hanks is subdued but is reliable nonethless. The rest of the cast are also very able, be that Frank Sr or Frank Jr's would-be father in law.In summary the direction, acting, scipt, photography, everything is top-notch. The only reason I don't give it a 9/10 is because it is a bit too long and I feel it could have been trimmed about 10-15 minutes. Well done Spielberg. Well done Di Caprio.",8,1,3,21 June 2007
Rang De Basanti," a landmark accomplishment
","i am writing this review, some months and RDB's release. I have seen it 2 times and the reason i am writing this review so late is because it is an incredible film.this landmark film features a story which is completely original. RDB is patriotic without being anti-Pakistan or jingoistic. from that you can discern the originality of the story.although the execution of the plot is melodramatic, it is justifiable since the theme is one of melodrama. the transition of typical/good for nothing guys into responsible martyrs is incredible. nothing is silly or predictable. there are many scenes which have been executed perfectly, so i cant name one or two.the performances are exemplary. AMIR KHAN gives a powerful performance but clearly does not overshadow the others. ATUL KULKARNI,KUNAL KAPOOR, SIDDARTH, SHARMAN etc are all very believable and impressive. i reckon one of the newcomers will definitely get the 'best newcomer award'.in summary RDB is a film that should remain in the minds of Indian youth forever. it is a film that will change the way we know India. the only reason i haven't given it 10/10 is because you feel it is too long in the first half. i think the film could have been trimmed about 15 minutes. but kudos to the director and scriptwriter.RDB will awaken a moral revolution in India. kudos to the scriptwriter and director. clearly, my favourite Indian movie. it will beat the forthcoming biggies like fanaa, don, kabhi alvida na kehna and get the best film award.when was the last time you saw a film that touched your soul and made you think differently about something?when was the last time you saw a film which actually motivated you to do something? dB has definitely done that.thank you all who were part in the making of this film.",9,1,4,30 April 2006
The Illusionist," a compelling movie
",i would rate this movie very highly. i am surprised some people did not see its merits and say that they saw the final twist coming.i was really taken aback by the final twist and it is one of the best movie endings i have ever seen.norton looks the character he plays and does a fine job. same goes for the other actors too. the setting and presentation is realistic. the best part of the movie is that it never bores you. i was saw the matador and apollo 13 1 day before i saw the illusionist and i must say there were some parts in those movies where i was really bored.a great movie and i hope we see more engaging movies like this.,8,0,0,5 June 2007
