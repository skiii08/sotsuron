Miracle," Great emotional movie with few complaints, 7 out of 10.
","I thought this movie was very emotional, great historical recap of the entire period from Day 1 to the Medal ceremony focusing on the struggles of Herb Brooks and bringing together one team to be a family and play a new form of hockey never attempted to defeat the Soviet Union, unbeaten in 20 years by the USA and constantly defeating the NHL All Stars.  They use actual footage of 70's Cold War events and weave together the Al Michaels 1980 call of the Soviet Union game into the on ice action.  The only complaint is the lack of emphasis on the Finland championship game, which was equally important to Herb Brooks who was cut shortly before the 1960 Olympics and never won the Gold before.-Ari",Null,0,0,30 January 2004
