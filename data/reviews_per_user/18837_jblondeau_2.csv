Marie Antoinette," Dismal
","Were it not for the superb scenes of Versailles this movie would be even more dismal. As it is, both Kirsten Dunst and Jason Schwartzman (and others) come off as flat as pancakes in delivery and characterization; it is not a deliberate characterization, perhaps meant to reflect the characters' alienation in the marriage bed, no, this kind of soulless, read-y delivery is just plain bad acting. Because so many elements in it are so disparate the film never seems to converge, but seems to be constantly trying to fly apart. It is not held together by any one thematic or cinematic element. The soundtrack is grating; it's not only what one wouldn't expect, it's an incongruous and anachronous assault, an attempt, it appears, to create a film hip enough to appeal to younger viewers with really short attention spans; it's not classic sturm und drang, rather it's clashing and uncomfortable. Visually, there are cutsie flip-cuts, stop-cuts, and short-shots. All combined, they're the ingredients that turn the film into nothing short of an expensive costume drama bereft of coherency. Dare I admit that I've seen better acting in L.A. garage porn? Forgive me, but skip this film. Cinematography, acting, soundtrack, characterizations, dialog, nothing can rescue this mishmash.",3,0,1,2 March 2007
Happy Feet," The Gospel According to Hollywood
","I especially detest the cutesy marketing for this film that would lead one to believe it's a happy musical tale, a children's cartoon with good dance music and a happy, feel good story. It is not. It may have feel good graphics, overall animation and a few good tunes. I give it a 2 for its technical achievements. But this film is a mix of tiresome, thread worn Hollywood themes, the same old hack ideas they've used for years. For example, 'religious' people, er penguins are stupid, backward fools who oppose reason and worship some unknown, hateful god. And they look like undertakers, too. Historically, Hollywood has portrayed Christians as ax-murderers, so perhaps it's a step up to have a religious character be merely a detestable Ichabod.The environmental preaching is insufferable: Man is bad, while nature, and the all wise penguins who represent it, are good. Man imprisons them in zoos and pollutes the polar ice caps. Penguins, representing all the wisdom of nature, represent The Way. The premise is not Man versus Nature, rather it's Nature versus Man. The film is neither cute, nor funny, it's preachy, the worst kind - Hollywood. It tangles around the viewer's neck in politically correct theology, and obscures and diverts what's left of a very thin, convoluted and unclear plot line. This film is not for kids. Don't let the cover fool you. Skip it.",2,0,0,3 June 2007
