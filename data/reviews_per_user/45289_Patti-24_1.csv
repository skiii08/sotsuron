The Blair Witch Project," awful
","The Blair Witch Project was the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life.  Do not waste your time or money.  The movie was not scary or interesting.  The worst part was I had a bad case of motion sickness from the ridiculous camera work.  (Yes, I know it was suppose to seem like a documentary in the woods)I am in search of a truly scary movie.",1,4,10,24 August 1999
