Catch Me If You Can," A very good picture
","Spielberg is a very eclectic director and film-maker.  I get the impression, he loves to dabble, as it were.  In any case, he is definitely a risk-taker. This film is a jewel in several ways.  Strong performances by DiCaprio, Hanks and Walken.  I'm glad to little Lennie getting out of his cutsy-tootsy, post-Titanic over-self-adorational stage.  He might eventually become an actor.  There are several moments in this film when he gives an excellent performance without resorting to his whinny, spoiled teenager persona he's shown us in previous films.  Hanks and Walken, as usual, are top pros and right on line. Walken's role is a poignant one as the unconscious enabling father, Frank Sr. and old Chris comes through in fine style.  Hanks (and, no, you reviewers willing to slam him for his 'accent;' he's right on with the New England dialect)is superb as the low-keyed, workaholic, driven FBI agent, Hanratty.  The circumstances of Abagnale's life and adventures are incredible and I remember reading about him back in the late 60s when he was apprehended.  This story-- his story-- is more of a statement on our American culture and how our commitment to excessive materialism can make fools of us all.  All in all, this film, while like most of Steve's brain children, is a bit too long but very engaging.  It is a delightful biopic with both hilarious and sad moments.  I recommend it highly.",7,0,1,2 January 2003
Finding Neverland," Sensitive, brilliant movie
","Johnny Depp is one of those actors about whom there appears to be no middle ground. Folks either dislike him intensely or can't wait to get in to see his films. I must confess that since I fall into that latter category. I've not seen a film with him that I've not liked since Edward Scissorhands.This one is no exception. It's just damn, fine theater. Peter Pan, the metaphor of the refusal of the adult to leave childhood behind,is in us all.In this simple child's play, with its mixture of stereotyped characters, Indians, pirates, middle-class Englishmen, children and fairy creatures, you bounce from one archetype to another like a steel ball in a pinball game. So profound is this mythic journey, the man behind it all is completely forgotten. Enter Depp. Supported by a superb cast, exquisite scenery and a delightful script, we get a glimpse of that lonely Scott in his turn of the century sojourn. The story is great: a creative man, introspective and solitary, in a marriage with someone with quite different values, motives and ambitions, he wanders into a relationship with a family of grieving boys and their ailing mother, Blanchett, and becomes not only part of their world but conspires with them to help build his universe of fanciful imaginative invention. The story is a love story, albeit very restrained in a post-Victorian world and constrained by his own moral code. The romance is wrought with sentiment but never descends to the sentimental; his relationship with the boys bespeaks Barrie's own lost youth and touches on his loneliness and isolation. Christie as Blancett's powerhouse mother is always beautiful and wonderfully controlling. The four boys are delightful with serious little Peter capturing our hearts. The wonderful Dustin Hoffman is great as the man who had the faith in Barrie to give him the freedom to let the Peter Pan in all of us, fly away, out the window into the freedom of the Neverland of our imaginations.",9,0,0,20 November 2004
12 Angry Men," EXCELLENT...no other word for it
","I rarely give a film a '10.'  But, this film with absolutely no weak spots deserved it.  Everything works.  All of the actors are great.  The film has a darkness to it, a quiet gray sense of hopelessness, as boring as a New York summer day, hot, humid and dark.  The weariness fades as the various members of the jury reveal bits and pieces of themselves as the plot unfolds and the wave of change sparked by new awareness begins to sweep the dreary juryroom.  The jurymen begin to lose their apathy, antipathy and conflicted, convoluted attitudes.  As the action goes on, each man must confront himself, his own values and his own fears, prejudices and weaknesses.  The ending is a triumph for all of us.  Reginald Rose not only put together a flawless thriller but look at that cast.  Not a cull in the bunch.  Several went on to establish themselves as character actors, e.g., John Fiedler, Robert Webber, Edward Binns, George Voscovec and Joseph Sweeney.  Some others were already stars in their own right, Ed Begly Jr., Lee J. Cobb, Henry Fonda and others, Jack Klugman, Jack Warden, E.G. Marshall and Martin Balsam went on to achieve stardom in films and TV.  All were veteran character actors who add a ring of credulity to their roles.  Rarely, indeed, only in a great once in a while, does it all come together as is does in this film.",10,0,1,14 October 2001
Spider-Man 2," Disappointment
","I guess I expected more.  This is a film for kids, I guess.  Given all the destruction and violence they encounter on TV and in video games, CGIs are just part of kid culture.  They expect it and tolerate it.  The bringing of comics to screen is hardly new and began back in the 30s and 40s.  Back then, the limits were imagination of the goofy directors who were able to patchwork props together to suggest the special effects.  Then, there were the old superman films with George Reeves which combined both...and they were pretty cheesey.  But, underlying all of this was the comic book heroes themselves.  Comic books were the epitome of the mythic journey where clear lines stood between the bad guys and the good guys.  You always knew who the villains were, just like in the cowboy movies.  They were invariably decked out in some symbolic feature like a tight-fitting costume, with the genitalia tastefully tucked away, which displayed the sleek, muscle-rippled bodies, all of which spelled out H-E-R-O.So, why does this film fall so flat?  It's got all the gimmicks, costumes, tension, unfairness, bad-guys who are basically good but taken over by some force they could not anticipate.  The brilliant scientist turned evil by his lack of foresight...the underlying message being, there are some secrets of nature, thou shalt not mess with.  Alas, the message is an anti-intellectual one and one that detracts from the power of the mythic struggle between good and evil.  It seemed to work well in the first film but the message in this is worn thin in this rehash.  There is a lack of continuity and the struggle of Peter Parker, which should be the struggle of every one, becomes a parody.  He gets knocked down, he gets stepped on, he gets slapped, he begins to lose his powers and descends into hell and is reborn. 
Those are powerful metaphors but they come across like a tune played on an old coffee can.  All we're left with is Peter Parker's confusion, growing self-doubts and final commitment, undermined by the girl he loves.  The sacrifice is made by the villain, Al Molina who refuses to 'die a monster.' We're left with the feeling there's still some good in the worst of us misguided souls.So, what's the lesson here?  Is Peter Parker willing to make that supreme sacrifice of love, career and normalcy, only to have it undermined by a now-understanding, woman who comes to him in the wedding dress she was wearing for another man, whom she ungenerously left at the altar?Stay tuned, as the James Dean-lookalike is waiting in the wings to don his father's garb for the next big money maker...while the suits like up to sell lots and oodles of Spidey goodies, games and treats.Could be, but maybe I'll pass the next one...I get the feeling I've seen it all before.",5,1,2,2 July 2004
Finding Nemo," No wonder everyone likes this one. It's great!
","Hey, I was skeptical.  All the flap...over a fish cartoon?  But, as the rave reviews came surfing in, my suspicions grew.  What could be good about a fish searching for another fish...?  My grandkids came to town and drug me along.  AND, I loved it!  This has got to be the best Disney in a long, long time.  This has great personal emotional moments without being maudlin and sentiment without being overly sweet. The bad guys are not evil...they're just on the other side of the firing line.  The AA-like 'Fish are friends, not food' sharks with their meetings, saluting and confrontations ('Denial!') are hilarious, as is the dentist and his kid-from-Hell niece, with the braces and music from Psycho.There's just lots in this film to enjoy-- for everybody.  Hey, I'd go again, if the kids would only ask me.",9,0,1,1 August 2003
Troy," Not bad but it ain't Homer
","Brad Pitt is an amazing actor.  He brings an intensity to the character of Achilles that lends itself well to the Hero's hero.  Eric Bana's Hector is likewise heroic, albeit much more stoic in his heroism.  Brian Cox is wonderfully sleazy as Aggamemnon and Brandon Gleeson is a likewise villainous Menelaus.  Sean Bean is wonderful as Odysseus as is Peter O'Toole as Priam...but the story... Hmmm.Depends what you want.  If you like Hollywood costume drama in a love cum tragedy setting with flashing swords, whizzing arrows, spears through the heads,with flashing moments of well-formed naked bodies writhing in the sack like snakes, then, hey.  This is your film.  If, on the other hand, you're a classicist who knows the myths backwards and forwards, you might want to check out some of the classics.  But, they all fudge the myth.  We know Aggamemnon was killed by his wife Clymnestra, who was Helen's older sister, BTW, Menelaus wasn't killed by Hector and... well, you know. 
So, movie fans.  It's worth the price of admission and does have some good moments.  It ain't true to Homer but, so what?  None of the great epics are true to the originals and when they are, they're usually a bust.",8,1,2,14 May 2004
Once," Unconventional
","Most stories have a plot woven around some issue of conflict. This little film wanders the streets of Dublin like the busker who has no more name name than the 'guy' and the 'girl' who crosses his path to encourage his musical pursuits. If you like the genre of music these young people create, you'll be pleased with this film Indeed, many have purchased the sound track after seeing it. Being from an older generation who doesn't really relate to this kind of music, I watched it with considerably less enthusiasm than those who do enjoy what these musicians are making. The story is quite undramatic with no twists of tension only a bittersweet nostalgic backflash suggesting the source of emotional turmoil the 'guy' is feeling. The 'girl' senses this and adds her own creative energy and eventually comes to feel more deeply for the 'guy' than she's willing to accept. Her own emotional turmoil comes out in the unfolding of the sequence and the whole things ends on a bittersweet nostalgic note. As a film, I appreciated the glimpse into a world of talented people who are creating their music,as it does show us some of the more sentimental aspects of those in that genre with becoming maudlin. The absence of violence was greatly appreciated and this film is certainly worth recommending, especially to those who listen to this kind of music-- because that's what this film is all about.",6,0,3,3 January 2008
Snatch," I LOVE THIS FILM!
","Guy Ritchie is one crazy Scot.  Lock, Stock..., his earlier film tickled me to hysterics but this film, full of artsy-glitsy fun, viz, Brad Pitt airborne, floating to the canvas, and great performances by Vinnie Jones, Jason Stratham, Benicio del Toro, et al.[Hey, everybody's good]really amused me. There're no soft spots.  It's hilarious. Now, reading through the 230+ reviews, I can see that black comedy, violence and mayhem is not everybody's cup of tea.  My wife, whose taste tends more toward chick-flicks, was horrified but watched it through to the end, wondering at times why I was howling with laughter at the grit and gore. Well, I guess you had to have been there... but I LOVE THIS FILM!  More, Ritchie, MORE, MORE!  WE'RE STILL NOT SATISFIED!",9,1,1,8 July 2001
Malcolm X," Spike Lee and Malcolm X: Some disagreements
","I heard Malcolm X speak at Berkeley in 1963, the year of Kennedy's assassination, albeit before that terrible event.  I remember that tall, intense, lean man striding to the microphone and beginning with, 'Brothers, friends...enemies.'  This film is a fine but flawed work which creates a confusing and often confused picture of a very complex man.  The Black Moslem movement is a significant political event in our nation's history. Lee's portrayal of Malcolm X, however, is much more Lee than Malcolm X. This film is long, repetitious and often tedious.  The coda is distracting, unnecessary and borders on the maudlin. However, Lee presents but misunderstands the turning point in the life of the late Malcolm X, i.e., the change from a political icon, mouthing the half-baked, jingoistic half-truths of Elijah Mohammud into a man who underwent a profound religious experience.  Many Black Moslems are an anathema to mainstream Moslems; this distinctive African-American movement is willing to lay all the ills of the African-American's treatment at the door of the 'whites.'  This is not religion; it is politics and has little to do with the religious tenets of Islam.  The accusation of Elijah Mohammud that Christianity is a 'white man's religion' and Judaism is practiced by Jews who 'exploit Black people,' is pure nonsense.  The origins of Christianity, Islam and Judaism have common roots among the Semitic peoples, Arabs and Jews, and it should be remembered that it was Islamic Arabs who ran the Slave trade that sold many of the West African ancestors of African-Americans into bondage in the Americas.  In fact, the international slave trade feeding slaves into the productive leg of the old Trade Triangle was created by the Portuguese colonization of Africa.  But, facts rarely enter into consideration where idealogy is concerned. Islam is a religion where the 'law (sunni)' is part and parcel of everyday living, as it is in Judaism, (i.e., no division of 'church' and 'state') bespeaks of its desert origins based on a system of tribal ownership of wells.  My point is, the Black Moslem movement was a political movement (and largely, still is) where the religious component has been greatly misrepresented.  The misconception and misrepresentation of Islam as a Jihadic or militant religion persists today in the anti-Arab attitude reflected daily in our public news media.  Unfortunately, Malcom X's diatribes during that his political period did precious little to remedy the situation.  Sadly, only after Malcolm X had made his hajj, did he come to realize that people are people and the real monster is the hatred people create for other people. Spike Lee is a fine film maker.  In spite of its flaws, this is a fine presentation of the life of one of the most interesting men of our past century.",7,7,18,18 February 2001
Empire of the Sun," Extraordinary film
","Reading through the reviews, there were a lot of people who didn't understand this film.  This is Spielberg's venture into the realm of art in cinematography.  This film is a visual masterpiece and you are swept along from beginning to end.  Yes, the tale gets a bit loose in spots and you never know what's going to happen next.  But, if you're willing to give up warm and fuzzy for lush visual images and startling leaps of character, you'll see what Spielberg's trying to accomplish.  This film makes use of the talents of Miranda Richardson and gives some early exposure to the likes of John Malkovich and Ben Stiller, but young Christian Bale steals the show. The reviewer that commented on the 'gothic' effect of the Tai-Pan's going to the costume ball being driven through Shanghai was right on.  This film is rife with such scenes and does not disappoint.  It's wholly misleading to look for some kind of action story underlying this film.  The tale, taken from the book, is straightforward enough:  a young boy's boost into manhood through the second world war.  The film is full of memorable moments and visually very, very pleasing.  As art, it is excellent.  That's likely why it wasn't a blockbuster, as say, e.g., Poltergeist, Close Encounters and the Jurassic Park films, were.  But, hey.  That's the cost of creating art as opposed to crap. And, crap does draw a lot of flies...",8,188,238,19 August 2001
Empire of the Sun," Spielberg on a limb
","This is an incredible film:  gaunt in storyline, visually beautiful and unusual in scope.  There is much to recommend it. The scene of the Tai Pan's on their way to a costume party through the teeming streets of war time Shanghai is Gothic and eerie while being richly pleasing to the eye. Unbelievable work, Steve.  But why wasn't it a box-office success?  Easy. No warm, fuzzy storyline, no squinting bad guys-- even the Japanese are given glimpses of being human. I think Spielberg should be thanked for indulging in art and not just another money-maker.  This is a visual experience with fine performances of just arriving Malkovich, Stiller and young Christian Bale.  See it.  It's worth the price of rental or admission.",8,0,2,27 October 2000
The Bourne Identity," Disappointing
","Aside from a good chase scene and some interesting photography, the rest of this Ludlum tale either falls on its face (viz: the superhuman feats of the amnesiac Bourne become rather trite after a while) or flattens out to a rather dull thud (the absence of a strong underlying story).  Too bad, as the gimmick in Ludlum's book, i.e., the loose cannon, the injured, traumatized Bourne, who is tied somehow to Carlos the Jackal, is now out of date with the aging Carlos presently behind bars in France.  The script lacks an over-arching conspiracy; in spite of an overworked attempt to implicate a conspiracy group within the CIA (who after the recent revelation of debacles show the CIA minions are a parody of themselves), the plot falters.  The film really never goes anywhere.  It becomes one beat 'em up scene after another, sparked by nearly impossible situations.  The scene-shifting, plot inside plot, spy vs. spy model of the Ludlum work is definitely missing.  Too bad.  Brian Cox, who created the role of Hannibal Lector and Matt Damon are nearly always worth the price of admission.  Too, wasted are the talents of character actors Clive Owen and Chris Cooper. Finally, the female interest, German Franka Potente looks lost most of the time. While this is not a bad film, Ludlum fans will be very let down as old Robert really caught our interest with this novel.  We would have liked a better script based on a decent novel.",4,1,2,22 June 2002
Cold Mountain," Fine film
","Many, many comments here.  Some good, many bad.  Zellweger steals the show. All the drama and intensity of this civil war odyssey aside wherein returning Odysseus too falls in the wasteland, Renee is simply wonderful. Her perkiness reminds me of an early Shirley Maclaine with the refreshing honesty and simplicity without dumbing it up.  Some fine contrasts between the social classes wherein Belles were raised to be Belles and farm girls were raised to be tough. The mindlessness and dehumanizing aspects of war are also clearly made, especially relevant in today's context [one hopes that this film will be shown at the White House...and understood there!]. Fine performances from Kidman and Jude, Hoffman and Sutherland...indeed, all give their best.  The corruption of the local Homeguard is often overlooked and it was a fine point to make.  The outstanding message seems to be that there was not a hell of a lot of romance in killing each other during the Civil War.  Hopefully, this message will be understood as being just as relevant today as it was then.",8,1,1,3 January 2004
Wanted," Huh?
","Alas, this movie reminds me of Marlon Brando's line in ON THE WATERfRONT, 'I coulda been a contender... I coulda had class...' Like the faceplate reviewer, I couldn't wait to get in the theater after seeing the trailers and teasers. I mean, Hey! Jimmy McAvoy, Morgan Freeman and Terence Stamp in a class action shoot 'em up! And, Angelina Jolie in the bargain. I went, waited with bated breath and, yes. Action. Shoot 'em ups, More action ... but one of the loosest story lines in years. I did not leave satisfied. Maybe some of you will and the little twists and turns will certainly not be revealed by me. Go see, think about it and decide for yourselves. I think you know how I saw it.",7,1,7,27 June 2008
No Country for Old Men," Superb! Excellent! Fantastic!
","OK. Cormac McCarthy is one of my favorite writers and the Coen brothers are my favorite filmmakers. No Country for Old Men is one of my favorite books and the deck was stacked before I saw it tonight. Rather than gush on with lavish kudos, let me just sum it up. Everything works. The action is fast-paced; the dialog is sparse, ala Cormac McCarthy; the layouts are fantastic in their meager presentation; the costuming is minimal; the music is not missed; the tension comes through the exquisite timing; there are no wasted moments, no wasted film footage and the transitions between scenes move like a well oiled clock. The acting is excellent, from the extras to the main characters. The scenery is believable and while there are some bloody moments there's no resorting to hitting the viewer with a lot of gore. Javier Bardem's ritualistic understated killer is chilling; Woody Harrelson's Wells is cocky, overconfident and tragic; Josh Brolin's character is pragmatic but outclassed; Tommy Lee Jones's Sheriff is a salt of the earth prototype-- everything works. Leaving the theater, I heard the grumblings about the 'non-ending.' To those comments and also to those included in these reviews here, all I can say is, it is an ending. It's just not the one you would expect. Cormac McCarthy and the Coen brothers aren't John Wayne.",9,0,5,26 November 2007
Seabiscuit," Great entertainment
","Reading through the reviews here, I note several that are thoughtful and insightful.  Of course, there are those 'This movie did nothing for me...,' comments too and one can expect such in a public forum such as this one. However, as an older reviewer whose mother was a racehorse maven who could give the genealogy (the 'blood lines') of any major race horse, who could name every jockey and his record, and who could recite statistics better than the Racing Form, I was raised with Seabiscuit and my views are somewhat different.  To begin with, one must start with Lauren Hillenbrand's book on the horse.  She recreates the era that made this horse the legend that he was with all the moles and wrinkles but she also makes the point that it was the combination of horse-- a questionable nag with good bloodlines but a poor showing from the beginning, trainer-- an out-of-the way ex-cowboy who had the 'feel' for horses, the riders-- Red Pollard and Georgie Wolff-- two great jockeys who understood how to get the best out of this amazing animal, and Charles Howard-- entrepreneur, adman and promoter par excellence.The movie gives us all of this.  Bill Macey's comedy-relief newscaster becomes the clarion for the awakening of the awareness of a new hero born in a time of utter desperation.   The cast is great and the story never gets maudlin.There may have been a few liberties with the facts but nothing is sacrificed for drama.  The story ends where it ought to end, leaving the viewer with a sense of departing nostalgia.  This movie has all the elements of a potential classic.  Whether it has legs or not, time will tell.  However, it is definitely worth the price of a ticket to see it on the big screen.",8,0,0,12 August 2003
Lawrence of Arabia," EXQUISITE!!!
","It hardly can get better than this.  O'Toole made his big splash in this one and rightly so.  The film is breathtaking.  As an anthropologist who worked with camel and cattle Bedouins for many years in Africa and the Middle East, I can only say the films captures much of the intrigue and paradox that makes up these fascinating people.  Er Lawrence (as he preferred to be called) was likewise paradoxical, mercurial and contradictory.  The film is just a masterpiece of cinematography and storyline.  The myth of this amazing man comes to life in more ways than one.  There are dozens of historical treatments on the Arabian campaign (called the 'Revolt in the Desert' by Lawrence) and even more biographies of TE Lawrence, later AKA Shaw.  None of them answer the questions that persist to intrigue us and perhaps, as the years slid by, we'll never know the true face behind the mask of a man, who on the outside surface was shy, retiring and self-effacing and at the same time who through his correspondence with such great lights as GB Shaw became a political gadfly.  The film bring all of these points to bear leaving us with the same questions asked in the opening scenes of Lawrence/Shaw's funeral, 'Who was he?'",10,0,2,12 February 2002
Hero," Good film
","Zhang Imou always gives us a visual feast and this legendary fantasy with Jet Li is no exception.  From the standpoint of the expression of the mythic journey in Chinese culture, the conflicts of human passion and morality often take complex turns and varied appearances.  The flashbacks work well, with the mendacity of the plot well integrated into the storyline.  The movement of the tale develops slowly, deliberately, like the metaphoric calligraphy wrought by the warrior artists.  The whole tale becomes a huge canvas upon which these intersecting plots mingle, change and emerge at the end.  It's not perfect and there a few strands that do not get tucked away, but the film works and works well-- as long as you don't look at with the criteria of a Western drama, which several reviewers herein have done.  To be sure, you can say anything damn thing you want in this commentaries but to stretch this fine piece of art on a board built for a Euro-American epic misses the point and renders a disservice in my view.The film is visually satisfying with many wonderful moments of fine acting. Jet Li who often is cast in the protagonist role of a Rice Western, is superb in his controlled performance.  I plan to see this film again on the big screen and get the DVD when it's available.  I suggest the same for you.",9,0,0,27 August 2004
Men in Black II," Not bad but not that good-- coulda been a lot better
","I read the reviews before buying my ticket.  I was not expecting much and was not disappointed but in spite of the enthusiastic endorsement given by the lead-in review herein, the film does not live up to the original.  There are some good moments.  The dog gets some witty lines and the new female interest is lovely to look at.  Tony Shalhoub is great, of course, and there is still great chemistry between Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith.  However, the story never really gets off the ground and quickly gets convoluted.  The villain, Lara Flynn Boyle seems almost disinterested at times and bored at others.  The lines are funny in spots but many of the gags and gimmicks of the first film are repeated and rapidly wear thin.  Still, all in all, MIB2 is not a bad film and the idea of a sequel was a good one.  My feeling is it coulda been a lot better with a little thought and imagination.",6,0,0,5 July 2002
Kelly's Heroes," Great Fun!
","Interesting enough, reading through the comments on this film, I noted only one detractor, some sorehead from Canada who completely missed the point of the film.  No, Sr. Canadiense.  This is not a serious film about WW2.  Read some of the excellent commentaries here about the social and temporal context of this film, i.e., the height of the Vietnamese war.  Yes, Sutherland, your fellow countryman, was an active anti-war protester and fully embraced the anachronistic hippie role.  The mad-cap story which tweaks the nose of the 'establishment,' in this case, the military establishment, is plausible when you let go of the blood, guts and glory of the war film genre. And, it is a damn funny film.  Eastwood is at his clenched jaw, cynical best; Savalas is great as the Sergeant big-guy; Carrol O'Conner is riotious as the general; Rickles is, well, Rickles.  But, Sutherland steals the show.  The scenes where they tanks come out blasting the Germans to the tune of twangy Country-Western music is hilarious. Sutherland's out-of-time-sync '...no negative vibes... hey, man...yeah, baby...' is side-splitting.  The final confrontation scene between the three striding up to the German tank commander, with Sutherland loosening his side arm, ala Clint Eastwood in Fist full of Dollars is a riot.   This film is full of funny stuff.  And, you can see it again and again and find new business to laugh about.  Buffs will delight at seeing Harry Dean Stanton in a pre-Repo Man role and Richard Davalos who played James Dean's doomed brother Aron in East of Eden.  This is a great piece of satire that was overlooked, cast aside and has still survived to the delight of those of us who enjoy it again and again.  But, hey, don't just take my word for it.  Of the 30 or so commentaries here-- and do read them, as there are some excellent ones-- only one was a detractor.",9,126,160,22 June 2001
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Superb!
","OK. I love Clooney, Downey, Daniels, Langella and Strathairn and knew this would be good but I didn't know HOW good! I remember the events and remember seeing the programs in depiction as an eager kid in high school back in the 50s. I recall vividly the 'Communist threat,' the censure, the black lists, the name calling and the impact of political accusatory innuendo on people's lives. Careers could be smashed and lives devastated by finger pointing with little or no evidence. Murrow was one of the few who had the courage and will to meet it head on. Clooney has done such a superb job of bringing the tenor of that times to the present and it takes little insight to see the relevance of the lessons of those times to the events and circumstances of today. Already, I can hear the cries of the NeoCons, screaming that this is a pure 'political' statement of a film and for once, I would have to agree with them. But, I would also recall the description of those time by Dashiell Hammett's girl friend, Lillian Hellman, as a '...time of scoundrels.'",9,0,1,2 April 2006
Shrek 2," Great. Just great!
","I can't wait for my grandkids to see this funny, witty film.  The message is clear:  be who you are because who you are is beautiful.  We have the old shrek crew reunited and add the talents of John Cleese, Julie Andrews, Rupert Everett and Jennifer Saunders.  Tony Banderas brings in some extra comedy relief and the Poos in boots, a hired hit-cat, brought in to do in our hero.  The action is lively, the exchanges snappy, the dialogue is humorous and Eddie Murphy doesn't lose control, for a change.  The landscape is filled with visual and thematic puns, the CGIs are seamless and the story works.  This is a very different film than the original, much less 'down and dirty,' albeit they do have lots of fart and body function jokes, but the film has a maturity in tackling issues like sacrificing for someone you love, accepting who we are, and refusing to be beaten down by prejudice. My wife and I enjoyed it thoroughly and we're sure we'll be seeing it again with the grandkids.  In fact, we're looking forward to it.",9,0,0,22 May 2004
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Amazing. Simply amazing.
","Roald Dahl was an off-beat writer of children's books. His stories are often dark, a bit wacky and always full of surprises. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is certainly one of these. I loved Gene Wilder's earlier version but appreciated more for Wilder's performance than for the somewhat 'softer' texture that they had given the story. Gone was the darkness and the gloom of Charlie's life into the bright sparkling world of Willy Wonka.Here, Burton, the master of the dark, brings all of the obscure and gray shades of Dahl's work to the screen with an amazing, simply amazing panorama of visual images, colors and thumpy tunes. The cloning of the images of Deep Roy is delightful and adds greatly to the fun of the story. But, the cast really makes it work. Who could play Charlie with that serious waif-look but young Master Freddie Highmore who was so splendid in Neverland, and who else could be Grandpa but veteran character actor David Kelley who delighted us all with his motorcycle ride in the buff in Waking Ned Devine? Then, there's the back-up crew with more character actors like Noah Taylor, James Fox and the wonderful Helen Bonham Carter.Then, there's Depp. Yes, I would agree with some of the critics, Depp does 'reach' at times but, hey: read the book. Depp IS Willy Wonka. He adds all the darkness and shadow to the mysterious chocolates. He keeps his goofiness restrained (something Wilder struggled with) and delivers his lines with a stainless steel glitter. Personally, I think Depp is becoming one of our finest actors and this role certainly adds to it.I loved it. My wife loved it. The kids in the theater loved it.

Black Hawk Down," Very emotional movie
","This is an excellent film in many ways.  As an avid viewer of war films, stemming from my very early years during WW2, it ranks high on the list of good ones in my view.  However, having said that, I must add that it was very personal and very intense for me because I was in Somalia immediately prior to the time these events took place.  The opening commentary by our Austrailian friend, I found to be quite touching.  As luck would have it, I was billeted in Baidoa, Somalia with the Australian CARE organization during the UNITAF occupation.  I had worked in Somalia as a developmental anthropologist during the period 1985 and 1986 and had Somali students while teaching at the U of Wyoming.  I had read Mark Bowden's excellent book and knew several of the individuals involved in the operation.  Moreover, Mohammud Faarah Adid had been my landlord when I'd stayed in Somalia before the civil war.I'm submitting this review in hopes someone will read it because this film should be seen as an indictment of war and the cruelty we humans often heap on each other.  Some reviewer extols us to 'leave the politics some where else.'  Crap.  You can't escape it.  Viewing this film as our President and his lackeys prepare this nation for more war so the rich can enjoy more wealth and the nation can enjoy cheap and pollute the environment with gas-sucking SUVs is pure politics.  No rational human being likes it.  But like it or lump it, that's what this film is all about.The youth of our nation and the Somalis paid a terrible price for the follies of our leaders. Let's hope we can learn something from it.",8,0,0,24 January 2003
Invictus," Just one great film
","People forget that Nelson Mandela came to power at a time when his country was bitterly divided. There was the bitter experience that white South Africans saw in their neighboring countries,i.e., Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe and other nations where the White colonialist had been replaced by Black African politicians and a stable government had been replaced by corrupt, self-serving regimes where those in power feathered their nests after seizing the assets of their former White citizens and placed all their friends in positions of authority with the result of the country going to the dogs. The scene where the Afrikaaner newspaper remarks, 'Mendela can get elected but can he run a country,' and the superb Morgan Freeman remarks to his bodyguard that the headline raises a good point.In a sense, this film is about Mandela. The rugby team becomes a metaphor of what he faced when ascending to the presidency, a nation divided. Noting that the Black South Africans were cheering for the opposition in the face of the old Apartheid guard whose love of rugby unified them. It's easy to forget that there was a great division among White South Africans, i.e., the descendants of the Boers, Afrikaaners, and the rest. There was even a middle ground with the 'Coloreds,' Asian South Africans, being caught between these two worlds and there were bitter rivalries among the competing African political interest groups as well.Mandela's focus on reviving the national rugby team and making it a symbol of a new united nation homes in on the role of Matt Damon, an Afrikaaner who's the captain of the team. Francois is the catalyst that makes this story work and Damon, the rugged Mick from Boston, does a fantastic job showing the transition from hopelessness to hope as many White South Africans felt at that time. The wonderful thing about this film is its touching on all the levels. It goes beyond being merely the story of a single man or group of men. Sure, we love a 'feel good' movie and of course we love an 'underdog can win' flick, but this film works works because its about people working together to rebuild something new for everybody.The film reeks with great moments: Pienaar visiting the cell where Mandela spent more than 20 years of his life, thinking and planning; The New Zealand Rugby team doing their Maori threat dance before the match; the jet buzzing the field before the game-- and so on. See it. Enjoy it. And, don't forget, it's a bit of history. Romanticized? Somewhat. Mandela wasn't able to solve all of South Africa's big problems, but he did one bang-up job for the Springboks.",10,97,123,11 December 2009
Invincible," Go Vince!
","For those of us who remember the Cinderella story of Vince Papale, the wild Italian from South Philly who was a walk-on with the hapless Eagles and played three seasons with them, this movie is a sheer delight. Although Wahlberg doesn't look anything like Papale, his grit and go attitudes along with his agility make the story come alive. At a time during the Reaganomic years when jobs were disappearing like water on a hot stone, Papale a part-time teacher and bartender was selected by new coach, Vince Vermeil, as a walk-on to play on special teams. Playing largely on pure guts and natural talent, Papale went on to capture the imagination of Philadelphia fans and won a place in the hearts and imagination of all of us. The probability of such events are low but there is always that mythic hope that 'it could happen to one of us-- maybe even me.' This film which does not lavish a lot of time on maudlin themes has just enough sentiment not to be sentimental and enough sentiment to show the impact of a local boy making good when all the chips seems stacked against him. This is one of our most popular American myths and when we see it in films like The Rookie,Glory Road, Miracle and now, Invincible, which are built people slipping into fame and celebrity, we love it because it always sparks that hope that dwells deep in our American ethos.",8,2,6,26 August 2006
National Treasure," Fun and games
","The Masons have long held sway as a mystical bunch of secret plotters who conspired to guard deep dark and arcane esoteric information. At least a dozen books have been inspired by this fraternity and the recent success of the Da Vinci Code has played on this long standing tradition. Tales of treasure and untold fortune, wealth and secrets of the universe thrill our imaginations and appeal to our sense of the fantastic. The fact too that our own western history lends itself to grail quests, ancient truths and hidden clues adds to the boiling pot. So, why not have a big Masonic plot to hide a vast treasure right under the noses of the population and have the clues hidden on the back of our most famous document. The fact that Washington, Franklin, Jefferson and several members of the 2nd continental congress were Freemasons ups the ante even more. So, what follows is good fantasy, good fun and nothing too serious to get ourselves wrapped up in. Cage is cool and Bean is sinister. The chase is on. It's always fun when a good yarn can be spun on a few facts and with a little imagination.",7,0,0,19 November 2004
The Great Raid," Stimulating bit of History
","For those of us who read Hampton Sides short history of the rescue, Ghost Soldiers, this film had a double meaning. The events depicted in the film are based on the heroic rescue of these men who had been held in captivator for the duration of WW2. While there may well have been some padding to heighten the romance, the fact of the matter remains that a small number of Rangers did indeed penetrate the jungle and rescue these men. While some of the reviewers may have wanted a more blood and guts, shoot 'em up kind of war film ala Rambo, the fact remains this is a testament to the sheer guts and determination of Col. Mucci and his rangers. Actors Bratt, Fiennes, Csonka and Franco turn in great performances as the principals in this event. As avid history buff of the Pacific theater of WW2, I found the film to be well done. Sure, there are some details that don't jibe with Sides's book, but so what? In the final analysis, Col. Mucci and his gutsy Rangers get their long overdue kudos and the spotlight of attention that they certainly earned.",7,4,6,25 February 2006
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," FUNNY, FUNNY FILM!!!
","Guy Ritchie has a way of making black comedy move beyond the Pale.  When you consider that the Pale was the region around Dublin where an Englishman could travel in safety, the notion takes on even more meaning.  Why does this film, a portrait of Marginal people who are all screwed up some way, work?  Well, there is a certain innocence to the characters which when coupled with their more malicious side creates chaos.  But, hey, isn't this the usual state of affairs in the human condition?  Aren't we all screwed up just a bit in some bizarre way?  This is a constant theme in the films of Joel and Ethan Coen and here, we find their counterpart in the backstreets of London.  But, it takes more than simply recognizing that we're all a bit goofy somewhere underneath to make a funny film and the likes of Vinny Smith, Jason Statham and the rest of the gang, combine to leave us howling for more. I know I was.  Why would an old geezer like me read all 270+ reviews here before writing these words that will likely never be seen? Well, it has to do with wanting to see if others saw what I did.  Most did. A few didn't.  We expect that. But, the vast majority found this film to be a riot.  I did.  I'm looking forward to seeing more from this crazy young Scot.",9,0,0,8 July 2001
The Da Vinci Code," So, what's all the flap about?
","Look. Dan Brown wrote a mystery thriller. He researched it using some revisionist themes and built it on an earlier novel and it became a best seller. Good fiction always spins yarns on bits of facts and figures and then weaves them into patterns to excite our fancies and footsies. The more fantastic, very often, the greater appeal. In the case of his novel, it worked. But, is this novel based on hard evidence? C'mon. It's a novel. If one takes it seriously as an exposition of esoteric beliefs, arcane knowledge and sinister conspiracies, that is one's problem. Ron Howard made this film because he likes meaty, twisty plots and got a great crew together to do it. Tom Hanks is great, as always, so is the very lovely Audrey Tautou, Paul Bettany is creepy, Jean Reno is intense, Alfred Molina is sneaky and Ian McKellen is slimy. The film is lively, fast-paced, follows the story line of the book and if anyone's offended, that's their fault for making this tale more out than the novel it is. The end product is an entertaining movie and thanks again, Ron Howard, for giving me my money's worth.",7,1,4,20 May 2006
Enemy at the Gates," Totally awesome, man
","At the risk of sounding jaded in my old age, I'm continuously amazed at the quality of reviews that can be summed in 'Wow, man.  Totally awesome!' or, 'Man, this movie sucked.'  C'mon.  We pay these guys salaries buying tickets and renting videos or DVDs.  As such, we can do better by looking at the content and form of the film.  And, this film is excellent in both form and content.  I'm constantly intrigued by how the English can kick our butts in the acting game.  I mean, Jude Law is Vassily Zaitsev (the name means 'rabbit' in Russian, BTW) and Ed Harris, getting to be one of our best, is Koenig (I prefer the German spelling for 'king').  Fiennes and Weisz are likewise superb as is Hoskins, a long way away from his initial exposure in Roger Rabbit.  The theme of this film is chaos.  And, if you read the defense of Stalingrad, that's what it was.  Seeing the scenes in this wonderfully dark film reminded me of reading Simeonov's Dni I Nochi, 'Days and Nights,' one of the most accurately portrayed histories of the Red Army's defense of Stalingrad.  It is a superb film and, gang, let's get beyond mere grunts of approval and disapproval of a fine film as this one is.  Save it for the endless sequels of Teen-age Slice 'n Dice 25.'  Sorry to be such a curmudgeon, but I really loved this film and think it deserves much better attention.",9,1,3,28 August 2001
The Terminal," Funny and punny
","Spielberg and Hanks.  Toss in Tucci and the lovely Welsh lass, Zita Jones and you're on your way.  There's lots of little bits of funny business and lots of puns, both oral and visual.  The story is amusing as Tucci plays the compleat bureaucrat whose stick-to-the-book attitude holds Hanks prisoner for month after month.  The entire movie takes place in a terminal and goes from there. This movie touches on a favorite Spielberg theme, i.e., lack of communication.  Hank's Divorsky teaches himself English during the enforced tenure and everyone comes to appreciate the simple honesty of this simple man. Check it out.  We liked it.",8,0,1,18 June 2004
Signs," **SPOILERS** This is Good Garbage
","There are two issues with this film.  One, is a thriller, in the same dark eerie mode of Unbreakable and Sixth Sense.  There is wonderful tension, wonderful cinematography, fascinating camera shots and decent performances.Then, there's the story.  It's crap.  Very disappointing, over-sentimental and maudlin to the max, the plot (?) is fraught with improbable, silly notions of prophecy, predation and predestination.  Aliens are coming to earth to 'harvest' us humans.  They're running around naked, they've the technology to come through the galaxy but are unable to get out of a locked closet (forgive me, pantry), they squirt poison gas and leave crop circles as landing sites.This is the same Mel Gibson who gave us Braveheart, Mad Max and Gallipoli. This is the same Joaquin Phoenix who was the slime in Gladiator.
A very disappointing and unbelievable film.  Unless you are in need of a strong emetic, stay home.  It won't even be worth renting on DVD or video.",4,1,1,12 August 2002
Beowulf," Interesting Twist
","OK. I wasn't expecting that the epic would be true point by point to the original and certainly wasn't expecting all the CGI treatments. However, I liked the twist on the original saga with the themes of greed, lust and power, all of which drive the political mechanism in culture and society. The perspective then becomes one of power corrupting, as both the old and young kings fall prey to the inner weakness of power, fame and glory. Beowulf's redemption is gained through self-sacrifice; his predecessor and successors' are left ambiguous and the mother as archetype of lust, greed and power remains eternal. Nice touch. Lots of fun things with Malkovich, Gleeson and the ever wonderful Tony Hopkins. Crispin Glover, although hard to recognize under all that CGI, is his usual competent self and the lasses, Robin Wright Penn and Alison Lohman are beautiful and sexual-- and then, there's Angelina Jolie who steals the scene each time with her dark, seductive beauty. Winstone with his Cockney toughness comes across well as the vulnerable hero and the battle scenes are wonderful albeit, a bit intense. So, if you want to read the original, for gosh sakes read Seamus Heaney's masterful translation rather some of the older stodgy versions. But, if you just want some great entertainment, see this movie.",8,5,14,17 November 2007
Hart's War," Willis at his Scowling Best-- sort of...
","This film has its moments.  But, to buy into it, you have to suspend any knowledge about WW2, Nazi POW stockades or likely situations.  The action focuses on Willis as the brooding leading officer in a POW camp, Colin Farrell is the law student pressed into becoming a defender for a Black Pilot wrongly accused of murder.  What transpires is a Machiavellian game with the Commandant, well played by Rumanian Actor, Marcel Iures, with plots and subplots, motifs and counterplots.  But, it really does not go anywhere. There are some nice twists at the end but the ending before the final credits I found to be cheesy and unsatisfying (I've always found it irritating to switch to an ending narrative when there was none to introduce the story).  Viewers who like Willis will not be disappointed and Colin Farrell is sure to delight the ladies with his Irish good looks, dark 'little boy' eyes and expressions.  Cole Hauser, back from getting eaten by an alien in Pitch Black, makes a wonderful sleazy villain but the rest of the cast seems to walk through their parts.  Also, Look for Joe Spano from NYPD in a bit part in the opening, but don't expect a lot from the rest of the show.",6,21,34,10 July 2002
Windtalkers," Violent but Thoughtful in Places
","A number of films dealing with WW2 have hit the screens recently, e.g., Pearl Harbor, Thin Red Line, Captain Corelli's Mandolin, etc., but this is the most violent.  In fact, the violence just doesn't let up.  The main focus of the story, i.e., Sgt. Enders (Cage) being charged 'to protect the code' at all costs gets somehow chewed up in the on-going onslaught.  This is not a film for someone looking for a good love story (ala Pearl Harbor). As I'm somewhat of a serious history buff, I'll resist being tempted to pick the tale apart from its many, many glaring inaccuracies.  We did indeed use Navajo phone talkers on the front lines during the Pacific Theater campaign of WW2 but the premise of the tale is pure Hollywood.  Also, I failed to count the number of Japanese soldiers Cage killed but it likely accounted for half the Japanese casualties of the Saipan invasion.  If we can't realize these aspects, we've no business going to the movies and should stay home reading our history books.  I was less put off by the historical slips than by the unrelenting blowing people up. On the positive side, I enjoyed seeing villains Jason Isaacs and Peter Stormare as good guys, Mark Ruffalo was a convincing Pappas and Christian Slater was enjoyable playing the harmonica with Roger Willie's flute.  I hope to be seeing more of them. As for the film, I got a bit tired of watching Gage wring himself out only to be soaked again in more violence.  The interplay of cultural elements and the racist confrontation between Adam Beach and Noah Emmerich added texture to a somewhat bemuddled story with more inter- and intra-conflicts than is found in a Pleistocene rain forest.",7,0,0,15 June 2002
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Ethan & Joel: More! More! MORE!!
","Let me say from the beginning, that I gotta be nuts to add to over 150 reviews but maybe some buff will read this and the others like I did.  I've read Homer's Odyssey, seen Preston Sturges's Sullivan's travels and all of Joel and Ethan's major films.  I love this one.  Why?  Interestingly enough, reading the comments by those who didn't like this film revealed more about the tastes of the reviewers than any real substance about the film.  Some didn't like 'abusing animals,' Clooney's dialect, or Klansmen marching in a Busby Berkeley parody.  All well and good.  Let's be perfectly politically correct and inoffensive...something Joel and Ethan don't do so well.  Page, Turturro and Clooney are great.  So are Durning and Goodman.  In fact, everyone was great.  There were no soft spots in the acting.  I especially loved the  folks down at home.  No cute little yuppie extras.  Those folks looked like Depression era Mississippians.  But seriously, folks.  This is an excellent film with lots of fun moments and one which I will see again and again.  And, BTW, how could anyone not like The Big Lebowski? 'No man, it's the Dude...'",9,0,0,31 January 2001
