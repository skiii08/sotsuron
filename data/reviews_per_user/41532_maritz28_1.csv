Sucker Punch," A Must-see Movie
","Sucker Punch, one of the most interesting movies that ever hit the silver screen. The movie really captured the crowd's attention with its it uniqueness of story, unbelievable effects and great directing. Though might not be called an 'Oscar' movie, its twist and turns definitely leaves you talking about it. Aside from its noteworthy plot, the movie also shows values of courage, independence, friendship, self-sacrifice and many more. It's imaginative director, Zack Snyder,and all the other people who worked behind the scenes really took their audience to another world. Of course, a movie is not a movie without the actors and actresses and, for me at least, they were very good. Sucker Punch is the kind of movie you want to watch with your friends or siblings because it really exemplified being there for each other and working as a team. To those people who said they did not understand the movie, I suggest watching it again and this time only focus on the movie and I assure you will see its magnificence. I recommend this movie to everyone.",8,6,11,20 May 2011
