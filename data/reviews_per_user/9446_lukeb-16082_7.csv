The Monuments Men," Yikes
","Incredibly boring, possibly one of the most boring films I've ever sat through, I'm actually annoyed at how Boring this was haha,I was expecting something much better, I do love me some war movies, but this was poor.-terrible boring script.
-characters..don't even know their name or anything about them?
-drags on way too long
-some cast members just phoned it in at times, especially Bill Murray.
-old fashioned film making...didn't really work sadly.
-kept switching from humour to being serious, was a little over the place at times.+ Good cast, couldn't save the film though
+ Original ideaReal shame, looked really good but as they say a good cast can't save a terrible film, 3 is generous.",3,1,1,3 February 2020
Argo," Tense and interesting, though loosely based on truth.
","Went in complety blind, all in all a decent gripping film. Although there are some bad points.<ul><li>loosely based on facts, appearentely Canada had way more involvement than what was shown. The UK took in refugees and so did france.</li></ul><ul><li>Ben affleck's acting...I'm not sure if hes depressed, hates his job or is just trying to portray a bleak character, but he does not express any emotion to his character, barely cracking a smile.</li></ul><ul><li>the story is not too complex and the characters are pretty standard, you'll most likely forget who they are after watching.</li></ul>Good points<ul><li>extremely gripping, especially the airport scene.</li><li>if you can suspend the historical context, it's a great story.</li><li>good actors and some funny lines</li></ul>",7,0,0,5 January 2020
American Hustle," Very very average
","Not one to hate films normally, but this was just..bad.<ul><li>the characters were not believable at all, just looked like dress up, especially at the start can see the makeup used on bales head.</li></ul>-story was a mess, just slow and boring to follow.-great actors and tried their best-went on for way too long, actually speed through the last 20 minutes or so.",4,1,3,6 January 2020
Elysium," Meh.
","Looks and sounds great. That's about it really, a cliche movie overall.",6,0,0,3 May 2020
The Da Vinci Code," Maybe it was just me
","Honestly felt quite bored by this effort of a film, failed to grab my attention for about 2 hours of the film. Felt a real slog to finish it and could have ended alot sooner.What made it so bad you ask? Well the script for one, the pacing, dialogue, the story.. everything! It just felt so boring to me.Now I've never read the book and I'm.quite neutral on religion and Christianity so maybe that plays into it. Might have to fetch the book instead!Even though you have tom hanks, he couldn't save this film.I much prefer the sequel!",3,0,0,18 June 2020
Unbroken," Pretty decent to be honest
","I'm actually quite shocked how much I liked this!I actually thought this was going to be quite mediocre (especially as jolie is directing!) but it doesn't Surprisingly disappoint, I know you have probably looked upon here for reviews and seen quite a few people slate it..(some reasons make sense) but it's not one to miss.Incredible story and pretty well acted, the brutal aspect was not missed and didn't shy away from the reality. Some films you can end up quite bored or looking at your watch half way through but no need for this oneNow it could be improved on little areas like the post war years, the ptsd, the Japanese commander not wanting to see him again, his forgiveness but apart from those aspects it's decent.",8,0,0,20 May 2020
Annihilation," Well that was something
","I'm not quite sure how I feel about this! I'm left quite confused but quite enjoyed the experience. I see a lot of people slating this film (which I can understand) but if you are on the fence give it a chance. It's a hell of a trip and leaves you questioning for days.Decentish acting all round by the cast.Now what stood out for me is the soundtrack and Dolby Vision /4K. Listening in Dolby Atmos and on a oled in pitch black, man hell of an experience! Colours shine and pop, haunting soundtrack adds tension.Definitely pick up the disc if you can.",7,0,1,8 June 2020
