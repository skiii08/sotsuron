The Avengers," Inadvertently Hilarious, Entertaining Movie
","It is quite unfortunate that after Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk, the Marvel films switched from being serious films to complete jokes. I was expecting 'The Avengers' to be a really bad film. However, instead of being painful to watch like Iron Man 2, Captain America, and Thor, 'The Avengers' is really entertaining as a whole.It is certainly an interesting film. It is sort of like the movie Machete, except much better. It has a B-movie feel to it, but is extremely entertaining. The villain is so clich√©, it is hysterical. Part of what really makes this movie shine is the horrible acting and dialogue by several of the actors and actresses. The three worst actors in the movie are Loki (the villain played by Tom Hiddleston), Nick Fury (played by Samuel Jackson), and Agent Maria Hill (played by Colbie Smulders).While the idea of watching a movie with horrible dialogue may not be appealing to some, there is another side to the movie that works well in an admirable fashion. And that is the super heroes, particularly Iron Man, The Hulk, and Captain America. These actors really add some emotion and movie star pizazz to the movie in the same way that Liam Neeson did for The Phantom Menace (which is probably the worst movie of all time). The effects and action scenes are all top notch. Though some of the action scenes with the Black Cat and Hawkeye are a little unconvincing considering they are just normal humans with no super powers or technology.Nonetheless, it is fun to also see Robert Downey Jr. make fun of the campiness and unbelievable other Avengers.",7,3,8,21 August 2012
Iron Man 3," Could Have Been Great!
","However, I don't know what they were thinking with villains here. Judging by the trailers, I thought they were going to make this one realistic like the first Iron Man. That wasn't the case. The Avengers took everything to a whole new level of silliness. Iron Man 3 continues that path.If you were expecting a real sequel to Iron Man (not the semi-sequel that was Iron Man 2), don't get your hopes up. Overall, this is obviously not anywhere close to being as good as Iron Man, but this is a step above Iron Man 2. I will say every time the villains are not on screen, the movie is great. You have to just bare through when they are on screen.",5,1,3,4 May 2013
The Maze Runner," Horrible Dialogue, Bad Acting, and Sequel-Baiting Ruin a Solid Premise
","I was intrigued by the trailer. It pretty much just showed the premise of the film and scenes from only the first 30 minutes. That made me think there was going to more to the movie than just exiting the maze.There was a little of that, but the movie ends about 10 minutes after they exit the maze to start 'Phase 2' as it is stated in the movie. There is no hint of what the sequel could even be about which is disappointing.Due to its bad dialogue and hammy acting, I wouldn't particularly want to see the sequel either unless the film gets outstanding reviews from the critics.My advice is stick to 'The Hunger Games.' This film is definitely not in the same league as that 'young adult' film series.",5,3,7,28 November 2014
Brokeback Mountain," Underwhelming
","The overall plot of the film is a great idea. However, it is just not well done.For the first 30 minutes of the film, the two main characters show no interest in each other sexually or emotionally, and the first love scene between them comes as a WTF? moment. If one were to not know the plot of the film, this would probably be a point where one would stop watching based on how laughably bad it is. However, the rest of the movie is pretty decent.The main problem with the film is that there is just too much to cover. We barely get to see the two characters' wives and how the two men's love affair takes a toll on them. The film just whizzes by through 19 years. It's like we barely get enough time to see the two main characters together during this time and barely enough time to see their lives away from one another. The film needed more focus.I do commend the acting of Heath Ledger here. After seeing his other roles, this one is a knock out just like his portrayal of The Joker.If you are looking for a better look at a homosexual man in the 1960's, I would suggest watching the first season of Masters of Sex instead of this.",6,1,10,27 August 2014
The Hateful Eight," Good Film, but Tarantino's Weakest
","The Hateful Eight is basically Reservoir Dogs in a Western setting, but it takes twice as long to tell the story. The reason for this is that it shows the back story of the situation in great detail unlike Reservoir Dogs. The first hour takes places outside the box and the rest of it in it.This first hour could have been taken out of the movie though or edited significantly. The dialogue in this first hour supplies a lot of back story for the main characters, but then they talk about this AGAIN and AGAIN as each main character introduces himself to the another new character. Hence, the movie could have just started with the characters in the box.I adore all of Quentin Tarantino's films, but I have to say The Hateful Eight is his weakest. Even though he is a master of building up suspense, the journey to the suspense takes way too long. (The payoff is great though.) The biggest detractor to The Hateful Eight is that it's not very fun. All of his previous pictures had moments of fun, whether through humor, the alluring dialogue, the style, or the action scenes. Here the tone is bleak throughout and the dialogue is very dry.",7,3,19,3 January 2016
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Big Improvement on the Original!
","I hated first Captain America (2/10). I thought Iron Man 2-3 were only average (6/10). I've never seen the Thor films as they definitely do not look appealing to me. The Avengers was an above-average popcorn flick (7/10) similar to the original Transformers film.So, my expectations were not high going into Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Yet, not since the original Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk has a Marvel film impressed me so much. I thought after Disney bought Marvel, that we would never get another actual good film. That's what this film is though.For 3/4 of the movie, I was very engaged in the plot and the action, because in between all those moments were genuine heart-to-heart moments between the main characters. Another plus for this movie is that for once in a superhero film, there is no romance subplot. Instead, you just get friendships.Anyways, the last 1/4 of the film dropped down the score for me as it was cheesy. It also undoes some of the emotional weight of the previous events of the film, which at the time these events happened, I thought it would be comical if what eventually does happen in the film actually happened. The whole idea of what the villains are about is kind of ridiculous too. It makes no sense that anyone would want what they want. Yet given the stakes of the last battle, which was very hit-and- miss, you'd think Iron Man or The Hulk would at least show up. Instead, you get a new hero character that just does not work in this particular battle situation. I was just cringing a lot during this whole scene which was probably about 25 minutes long.After this big battle is over, you still get an epilogue that has one part that is quite corny too. However, the last scene of the movie sets up at least part of Captain America 3 and I would like to see where that story goes, depending on the reviews of that film of course.",7,0,2,8 April 2014
Captain America: The First Avenger," Very Mediocre, Very Few Redeeming Qualities
","The movie is completely harmless to watch. There's lots of cheesy, feel good humor. The villains seem non-threatening and extremely hokey, as well as the origin of Captain America. How can this technology exist if we don't even have it today? (Laser Guns, Robots, Vaporizers) At one point, they mention Captain America's genetic code is different than his serum. They didn't even know anything about genetic codes and DNA back in the 1940s. Question: Why does the villain, Red Skull, have an actual Red Skull? The action scenes: at no point is Captain America in any danger nor do you really care about his character. He has basically no character flaws at all. Question: How does Captain America's shield come back to him every time?The visual effects: except for the impressive digitalizing of Steve Rogers before he becomes Captain America, the CGI looks basically like the same quality as the Matrix Redloaded at some points.The acting: Okay. No real stand out performances. Love relationship: Why is that woman in the military to begin with? I'm pretty sure that there were no women in that high of a position? At the end of the movie, she even goes into battle. Maybe a nurse would've been more believable. I don't recommend this if you hate the movie Avatar: it's very similar, but a little better than that one as well as being similar to the 2nd half of The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.Rating: Avatar(Rating names are based off of films of the same name that happen to be as bad or as good as the film being reviewed.)",2,75,157,28 July 2011
Nightcrawler," Very Original Premise For a Film and One of the Year's Best
","'Nightcrawler' is one of those films where we follow the actions of a sociopath. He goes down a darker and darker path. If that is a film that you would enjoy watching, then I would see this film.The acting is topnotch. The subject matter is pretty creepy (filming crime scenes/accidents). Jake Gyllenhaal's character is the big draw here.The only faults I can find with the film are:1. The dynamic between Jake Gyllenhaal and Rene Russo's characters. It is not very believable. 2. This is just a film about a man who goes down a darker and darker path. It's been done before. There's nothing magnificent about the plot and it gets pretty predictable.It's in theaters now. So, I would go see it, because there really isn't much else to see except for Birdman, Whiplash, and Foxcatcher if you can find them.",8,1,3,6 December 2014
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Mission Impossible Continues Series' Trend to Choose Action Over Plot
","Mission Impossible 1, in my opinion, had the plot and the action to go with it. Mission Impossible 2 may have had an okay plot, but the action was over-the-top stylized and was just a bad film. Mission Impossible 3 didn't have much of a plot, but its action and villain made up for it and was the best in the series.Mission Impossible 4 started the series on the path that puts action over plot as if there was no effort to actually make a plot. It had the series' best set piece, but the action was REALLY unrealistic. The worst was when Tom Cruise jumps off of a skyscraper into a lower part of it only to hit his face on the window above. This would kill him.In Mission Impossible 5, we find more incidents of Tom Cruise being immortal. He hits his head on metal as he gets flown into a plane by wind. He survives a ridiculous car crash where the car flips over while falling down 3 stories too at full speed. He survives crashing a motorcycle into the ground.Rogue Nation to include a villain who was as intimidating as Phillip Seymour Hoffman. However, the actor and the events in the film make him feel more tacky than anything.Mission Impossible 4 and 5's action style is the same Live Free or Die Hard while Mission Impossible 1 and 3's style were more in line with Die Hard 1 and 2. Pretty much everyone agrees Die Hard 1, 2, and 3 are far superior to 4 and 5. I would think people would think the same about the Mission Impossible series. Right now, Tom Cruise's new Mission Impossible films are not actual movies. They are just excuses to have well-thought action scenes that border on disbelief. They are typical summer blockbuster fluff.",8,0,3,6 September 2015
Bad Teacher," Look at who the writers are of this movie. It will tell you the quality.
","Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg are the credited writers of one of the worst comedies ever made: Year One, the movie where Jack Black and Michael Cera played themselves as cave men. Here the same type of mean, non-creative, only mildly entertaining humor is at play because they wrote Bad Teacher.Some may even say that this is a wasted opportunity with this cast. I beg to differ. You mainly have one ACTUALLY funny person in the cast and that's Jason Segel, which happens to provide the movie's only funny moments. All these other actors would never be capable of writing funny jokes in stand-up or in a movie. They are all just actors there to just read what is given in front of them, entrusting that the jokes in the movie are going to be funny. Unfortunately, not even that happens in this film.The humor in 'Bad Teacher' mainly is about shock value only. The shock value here only comes off as repulsive and definitely not funny. Where is the wit in any of the lines? What are they expecting an adult reaction to be with some of the jokes in this. Someone farted really loudly on the toilet. Reaction that didn't happen: 'HAHAHA.' Or it shows a kid with an erection as Cameron Diaz washes a car. Reaction that didn't happen: 'OMG, did they really just show that? Hilarious.'Overall, I give this a rating of: 'Bad Teacher'. (Some movies just start a whole new rating.)",1,14,26,11 August 2011
X-Men: Days of Future Past," 9/10 Amazing, 1/10 Not That Great
","When I originally saw this film, I saw it as a 10/10 film. It was the best X-Men film. Upon watching it again, what sticks out for me are the future sequences. I tried to approach the film, not as an avid lover of X-Men, but as someone who did not care for X-Men. The beginning is okay as it starts in the future and has to get the film going. But as the film climaxes, the events in the future and the past are both coming to a climax. The future side is all action and it is unnecessary, because we know that somehow the plot will come to a resolution. And we know exactly how the future plot is going to end. The past sequences are so tense that they did not need any tension at all in the future sequences. The future 2.0 should have just been left up to the main characters to form in the past sections as it proves difficult throughout the whole movie to do.Everything about the past sequences is terrific. The acting, the drama, the tense action scenes, the story line, etc. Fassbender and McCavoy are once again the stand-outs in this film as they were in First Class.I hope with the next X-Men film, the film will take place in the 80's and only the 80's.",8,1,3,25 August 2014
Captain America: Civil War," Silly, But Entertaining (Even For a MCU-hater Like Myself)
","Captain America: Civil War a combination of the seriousness of Winter Soldier mixed with the ridiculousness found in The Avengers. It shouldn't work but it does, and is the best film in the MCU.There's an action scene in the latter half of the film at an airport that has been really hyped up that fits that profile. On paper, this is a scene idea that could break your movie. I can imagine that if I was the director of this movie and Marvel told me I needed to have this scene in the movie, I probably would have walked off the project. 'That's just too much ridiculousness for me in one scene,' I'd argue. Somehow the Russo's made it work and I commend them for that. It's not the best scene ever. In fact, I'd say it's just okay. Still, it didn't break the movie and I call that a success.Overall, the movie is solid throughout (though the beginning action sequence is sort of blah). People have said that the villain isn't strong as usual for a Marvel film. I'd argue the opposite actually. He seems sort of generic at first, but once he reveals his cards, he's actually pretty great. He's a sympathetic villain in my opinion and is probably the best superhero villain I have seen on film since The Joker. He's nowhere near that level of greatness. I'd say he's more along the lines of Doctor Octopus from Spider-Man 2. The only problem is that he's barely in the film.Instead, this movie is more dedicated to having The Avengers show off their powers and battling it out. That's the main conflict here and in the end it is sort of a weak point of the movie as nothing's really resolved morally.The movie puts forth that The Avengers should be held accountable for their actions and be controlled by the UN because of the collateral damage they cause. Iron Man and some Avengers agree with this. Captain America and his friends disagree. Eventually though Iron Man comes around. But why did he actually? There's really no justifiable answer. Besides Iron Man, you wonder did the other Avengers that sided with him change their minds too? That's not even answered. So basically the premise of the movie has no real conclusion. In fact, the movie just ends out of nowhere.In my opinion, this conflict is hard to resolve as I do see both sides of the issue. As a viewer though, I would have liked the movie pick a side and then justify why it was the correct choice.But in the end, it doesn't really matter because as soon as more aliens or whatever supervillains arrive, The Avengers are going to put all this bureaucracy aside and fight the bad guys in future installments.Side Note: The way the script is put together is actually similar to Bruce Lee's Return of the Dragon in that throughout that film, Bruce Lee put a lot of care and thought into it. It was quite brilliant in action and comedy. But for whatever reason, the movie's ending is dumbfounding. It's like Bruce Lee just got sick of writing his script and thought, 'Eh, screw it. I'm tired. I'll just write some monologue that doesn't make sense and say 'The End'.' That's what it feels the screenwriters of Captain America: Civil War did too.",8,5,10,11 May 2016
It Follows," Very Overrated and Has Nothing to Offer That Isn't in the Trailer
","After getting an 83/100 Metascore, I had high hopes for It Follows. The premise seemed really creepy. But you'll find that this movie is just like Scream or I Know What You Did Last Summer only slower and not as entertaining (since those films are at least bad and entertaining). There's no real character moments to elevate this film to a score of 8/10. The Babadook was pretty overrated too, but was better than It Follows. I had high expectations for both films. Perhaps critics have such low expectations for horror films that they just give any film that is slightly better than the norm a great score. Or perhaps I am not a fan of horror movies in general.",4,8,55,14 June 2015
Ex Machina," Just What the Trailer Showed
","A movie should not give all of its cards away in the trailer. Ex- Machina does. If you take a Christopher Nolan film like Inception or Interstellar, there are tons of plot lines and acts in the film that were never presented in the trailers. You have no idea where those films are going to end up. This is what makes those films, in my opinion, so great. Ex Machina's trailer was great, as I really looked forward to seeing the film (very rarely does a film's trailer entice me enough to want to see it). Ex Machina just feels incomplete. It needs a third act (another 45 minutes or an hour's worth). If a sequel is made, I will consider seeing it and perhaps rate this film higher. If Ex Machina is just a standalone film, it will always just be pretty good science fiction film.",7,0,2,15 May 2015
Guardians of the Galaxy," Lifeless and Dull Film
","SummaryI have a bad relationship so far with Marvel-Disney. The best film they've made so far has been Captain America 2: The Winter Soldier (7/10). The other enjoyable film they've made is The Avengers (7/10). All their other films were not good films though. Same with Guardians of the Galaxy. If you like Marvel-Disney films, you'll probably like this movie. If you don't like them, you probably will not like this movie.ReviewGuardians of the Galaxy was pretty mediocre for me. Nothing was horrible or great. It had a few lines of funny dialogue. Most of jokes failed to hit. In fact, there seemed to be at least one joke every 30 seconds. This became annoying. The character, Rocket, was a knock-off of Timon from The Lion King. Imagine having Timon in every scene of a movie and mouthing off at any chance given. It really gets irritating. Though, I think the main problem with movie was its overuse of (mediocre) special effects. The recent Star Wars movies suffered from this same problem. The action scenes were lifeless and lacking any suspense. Plus, whenever the main characters are put in danger, some sort of magic bails them out.Overall, the movie tries too hard to be fun. It fails in my opinion. I know most of the people who saw the film disagree with this assessment. Side Note: there were like four or so lines of blatant objectification of women which I didn't appreciate. One main character calls the main female lead, 'A stupid whore,' when she has not acted sexually or promiscuous throughout the whole film. Even if she had, it is still wrong to call her that. This angers me as this film is meant for the whole family, and more specifically kids. This kind of behavior should not be shown as acceptable to young men or boys.",5,7,17,13 August 2014
X-Men: First Class," 1/2 Great Film, 1/2 Average Film
","This film could've been amazing. The characters of Magneto and Xavier bring a new energy to the series. As a fan of the animated cartoon, I never got to see either of these characters fully fleshed out with their backgrounds (there was one episode of a flashback, I believe).While the first half is excellent, the last thirty minutes or so are just okay. This is mainly because the focus is mainly on Magneto, Xavier, and MacTaggert. The last thirty minutes deals with training the students of Xavier and an epic battle. The problem is that none of his students (except for Beast or Mystique) are layered-characters and that they are all b-side characters. There is no reason to care about them.Regarding the final battle, the only entertaining parts involve Magneto and Xavier. The other parts involve the b-side x-men battling the b-side villains. The worst of the latter is the battle between Angel and Banshee. It's just plain cheesy and unnecessarily dull (almost cringe-worthy). In fact, the whole character of Angel, along with her super powers, is lame (along with Havok too, who is just a sub-par version of Cyclops).The film could've worked without the inclusion of any of the b-side x-men. Xavier, in theory, could take out any of the villains, but Singer and Vaughn must have felt that it was necessary to have some more x-men we hadn't seen before. It's just really too bad that there aren't any good ones to really choose from that we haven't seen before.",7,1,5,16 June 2011
The Wolverine," Second Best Superhero Movie Ever Made!
","This is by far the best X-Men movie ever made. And it's better than any of the Marvel-verse movies (let's be honest: the only good ones were Iron Man 1 and The Incredible Hulk) and all of the Spider-Man movies. I was let down by The Dark Knight Rises (mainly its inexcusable unrealistic second half).So, let me tell you why it's the second best X-Men movie ever made.1. First Class and The Last Stand suffered from too many mutants. Here we only have 3 mutants in the whole movie. Because of this, I don't have to suffer through cheesy scenes where mutants show off their powers to each other or see B-mutants that I don't care about develop their powers.2. Seeing Wolverine emotionally and physically vulnerable. He gets dreams of Jean Grey constantly, whom he killed in The Last Stand. He does not want to live because he killed her. He secretly loved her, and never wanted to kill again. This last mission gives him purpose. The last battle scene seems to be getting a lot of flack for being your typical comic book last battle scene. I don't see that at all as Wolverine is clearly outmatched by The Silver Samurai.3. There are only a few action scenes. But they are brutal. Wolverine is interesting because he cares so little for the life of bad guys. And he has never been more reckless here in killing them. Having a few action scenes is better. The movie can focus more on his character this way.4. X-Men 2: X-Men United was a great comic book movie. But having a superhero more grounded in reality makes for a much more interesting film always. This is way Iron Man 1 was good and why The Dark Knight trilogy was mostly great. By not showing other mutants and by not having a mutant-related conflict, The Wolverine is more grounded in reality. Instead, you have just a mutant involved in a human conflict.(Spoiler) I saw a reviewer criticize that the female character and Wolverine had no chemistry. They didn't need chemistry to be physically attracted to each other and have sex. It makes sense for the female character to want to have sex with Wolverine (way more than Talia Al Ghul and Bruce Wayne in The Dark Knight Rises). They are not in it for a relationship. They just had sex.Now why is it the second best superhero movie ever?1. Spider-Man 2 has unbearable scenes between Aunt May and Peter. 2. Iron Man has a lame last battle scene. 3. Batman Begins has some cheesy dialogue and moments. Plus, it has Katie Holmes. 4. The Avengers is nothing more than popcorn entertainment with no thought at all. Plus, it has some horrible acting and dialogue in it by Colbie Smoulders. 5. Man of Steel is great, but they got the whole fighting concept all wrong. Superman or Zod never seems to get hurt or knocked out in their fight with one another. They don't bleed or get bruises. 6. Superman: The Movie and Superman 2 both have the horrible, 'let's undo everything' ending.The Wolverine doesn't have any of these cringe-worthy moments.",8,0,3,12 March 2014
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," No Originality (Sans one plot point)
","This will be a spoiler-free review regarding anything not in the trailers or posters!!!The Force Awakens is just so-so and is only slightly better than Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Its main problem is that it felt 'forced', no pun intended. I think the film lacked the time necessary to develop a great story, which in interviews with J.J. Abrams you'll read about. They first started a script with Lucas's ideas. They scrapped those and then they were in a time cramp of just a few months to develop a plot/script. George Lucas spent at least 7 years dreaming up the original trilogy and had another 15 dreaming up the prequels.There is a lot of potential here, but given the time lapse of 30 years that takes place between The Return of the Jedi and The Force Awakens, there are too many aspects of the plot that don't make sense.1) If you were like me, you were probably thrown when it was revealed in the trailer that there is an Empire still (called The First Order here). How this is possible is not explained. We are just supposed to accept that they exist and are a powerful threat. For me, this just doesn't make sense. The Empire was defeated and the galaxy cheered. How could the new Republic allow such a rebellion to happen and for that rebellion to build another death star? The rebels (heroes) of the original trilogy didn't build a death star, because usually rebels are outmatched. Here it is almost treated that The New Order is more powerful than the government. Plus, how could Luke Skywalker (the most powerful person in the universe) let this happen? 2) 'Nothing will stand in our way... I will finish what you started.' The new villain Kylo Ren says this in the trailer to Darth Vader's helmet. What did Vader start? Why does Kylo Ren even admire Darth Vader? These are questions that are not answered and make problematic the character of Kylo Ren's motivations.There are more I could go over, but then I would be spoiling the movie. The villains are just a mess in general.The heroes, on the other hand, are pretty great. Han Solo, Chewbacca, and Leia are amazing to see again. Rey and Finn are extremely strong characters. There is a lot of humor that works here and no cringe-worthy lines. The quips and reactions seem genuine and realistic, unlike say those in Marvel-Disney films. The big plot point is quite original and very unexpected. There were a lot of plot points I saw coming and was proved correct, but this one blew me away.But like Marvel-Disney films, this movie doesn't take any risks. It knows what audiences want and gives it to them for the most part. There is a scene with some major Deus Ex-Machina at the end that just had me roll my eyes. Then there is of course the plot point of the new Death Star, which baffled me. To use this threat for a THIRD time was just ridiculous and if you thought the use of it a second time was lazy, here the mission to destroy it feels tacked on just to give the give characters some things to do outside the plot we actually care about. You would think that Disney would have listened to all of the fan's complaints about everything post The Empire Strikes Back, but here they didn't.Lucas's prequel trilogy gave us something new, a lot of which didn't work. But at least it was new! Those films (outside of The Phantom Menace) felt more compelling than this one. I personally loved Revenge of the Sith and The Attack of the Phantom (the highly effective edit of Episode II). There wasn't a moment in The Force Awakens that matched the highs of those films (and even horrible The Phantom Menace, which couldn't be saved by an edit unfortunately).Still, The Force Awakens is enjoyable. It just doesn't deserve to exist unless the sequels really blow us away. Hopefully, that happens! Score: 6.5/10",5,6,15,19 December 2015
Deadpool," The Character Works, but the Rest Doesn't
","I have to admit, I did chuckle a number of times during the movie's onslaught of nonstop jokes. However, that's really all the movie has going for it. The fight scenes are not involving (mainly because Deadpool is invincible and has a lackluster villain). The love story doesn't really work either for such a violent character nor does the back story. Fox probably shoehorned all these elements that really drag the movie down--the superhero movie clich√©s--because even though they were taking a risk in making this R-rated movie, they didn't want to go all out with it. All those clich√©s really stand out against all the parts that do work because they are so lackluster. It felt like no effort was put into any of those areas mentioned above compared to the effort put into making the character as good as he was.The potential is there to make a good movie in the future with Deadpool though and given the massive box-office success the film was, I'm sure the sequel will be better able to focus on giving us a plot worth caring about and more innovative action sequences.Add-on: Some of the jokes are very rape-y and off-putting.",5,1,5,13 June 2016

Spectre," A Disappointing, Throwback Unoriginal Mess
","Part Die Another Day, part Roger Moore Bond, and part You Only Live Twice is a recipe for disaster. After three successful Craig films, the Bond/MGM machine puts no effort into the script yet spent $250 million making the film somehow. It really all started with the end of Skyfall. There were lots of throwbacks to that the old Bond was coming. Here, almost every scene is a throwback. There's the helicopter action scene from A View to Kill. There is a train fight scene from From Russia With Love with a Jaws type character who has no dialogue throughout the movie. There's a torture scene similar to Casino Royale. There's a snow chase through the mountains that reminds me of the tank scene in GoldenEye. There's a bad guy headquarters similar to Dr. No or You Only Live Twice.The dialogue is tacky and predictable. The villains are uninteresting and really just wasted potential. There tries to be a love story angle that is supposed to be as interesting as Casino Royale's, but there is no time spent on developing it. The main characters maybe spend at most a week together before the female lead professes her love for Bond with no discernible reason. The only aspect of their relationship that made any sense is the first time they have sex.The worst offense this movie makes is trying to connect all of the Craig movies together, with the bad guy proclaiming that all those previous villains were under his command which is just ludicrous and really undermines the events of Skyfall the most. The second worst offense is that the bad guy is Bond's brother-in- law which could have been interesting, but the film puts no depth to their relationship. (This revelation is revealed within the first 30-40 minutes.)If I were Craig, I wouldn't want to come back to this role either. Spectre does what Diamonds Are Forever, Octopussy, and Die Another Day did. It has dealt the franchise a major, possibly fatal blow. I don't think there is a point to making another Bond film. The Craig Bond was supposed to subvert tropes of the franchise. Instead, Spectre embraces them while trying still trying to be modern which fails miserably.",4,10,21,9 November 2015
Her," Really Great Film. Odd Resolution.
","This film was so wonderful and happy. It was wonderfully romantic. It's about human growth and recovery from heart break. That might describe every movie, but this one does it really well and has such an original premise. The only fault the movie has is in its resolution which makes you think rather than giving you a straight answer of why it happened.A lot of people were saying they hated this film after the movie ended as I was walking out of the theater. So, it is definitely not for everyone. If you hated Where the Wild Things Are, don't see this movie. If you loved Where the Wild Things Are, see this movie. They are very similar movies. Both are kind of out there.(Note: I liked Where the Wild Things Are Better.)",9,1,3,12 January 2014
