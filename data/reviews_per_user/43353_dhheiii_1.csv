Your Name.," Watch this movie. You probably won't regret it.
","After years of browsing this site, I finally broke down and registered so I can share my opinions with strangers who probably won't care about or even read what I write. But then again, in the past I've used these reviews to help make a decision whether to watch or pass on certain movies. As the best movie I've seen in years, Your Name seemed like the right one to start with. I'm not going to attempt a technical, elitist analysis, as I'd probably just end up sounding like a pretentious moron. I'll just try to hit some key points.As a disclaimer, there's only about 3 directors that I consider myself a fan of, and Makoto Shinkai is one of them. I've seen all his films and enjoyed them to various extents. Your Name is different from all his other movies and, I would say, is his most complete film. The most notable difference is the tone. Whereas most of his works are much more somber, this one has a lighter, comical side that offsets the deeply emotional moments making it more accessible to a wider audience.To be fair, this movie has some flaws. There's a few logical gaps that you just have to ignore for the movie to work. The main characters aren't overly interesting in their own right, and few, if any, of the side characters are developed throughout the film.However, what this movie does well, it does exceptionally well. It is definitely a story-driven piece and the story is deep, interesting, and well-told. I'm not going to mention anything approaching a spoiler. I went in with almost no knowledge of the plot and had a more rewarding experience because of it. I will say, though, that if the first 30 minutes or so seem a bit silly for your taste, stick with it. It gets better.For those wary about getting into anime, this is a good one to test the waters with. It's absolutely nothing like the bits of Pokemon or Dragon Ball Z you may have accidentally glimpsed over the years. I've seen both the Japanese version with subtitles and the English dubbed version. If possible, it's always better to watch a movie in it's original language, but I know not everyone can handle subtitles. The voice acting for the English dubbing is passable. It's not perfect, but it probably won't ruin the experience for you.I tried to be as objective as I could in rating this movie, but there's really no such thing as true objectivity with something so emotionally driven as the film industry. This movie is a personal 10, but I feel that 8.5 stars (rounded up to 9) is an accurate rating. So, anyone reading this who is on the fence about watching this movie, here's one more random person urging you to give it a try.",9,6,9,4 June 2017
