3:10 to Yuma," Not sure what the excitement was all about.
","I saw the advert on TV one night and it said something like 'critics are calling 3.10 to Yuma the best western for years' or something like that, but anyway i thought i'd go see it, and i did, and to be honest I'm not sure what the fuss was about. There was nothing in this movie that stood out to make it something special only basic stuff which we've all seen, all the gunfights at least one person died on the goodies team which was a failed attempt to make them look realistic, Bale had a long range sawn-off shotgun which could kill someone from about 30 metres, Crows character Ben wade had a personality change, one minute he's a ruthless killer the next he's a nice guy who helps Bale do his job, the ending was not what you expected in a bad way and cause's Crows character to have a even bigger personality change.Over all 3:10 to Yuma was a disappointment which did a good job of getting me excited over nothing, in fact the characters were so stupid at times it almost makes you think 'why the hell is he doing that its such a simple thing to get out of a building thats surrounded by men, why don't you just kill them with the long range sawn-off shotgun like a classic western would do'.i give 3:10 to Yuma 4 out of 10 its better to watch a 50's,60's western.",4,1,6,26 September 2007
Kickboxer," My favourite Van Damme movie
","Kurt Sloan (Van Damme) is corner man for his brother Eric who is the Kickboxing world champion, after beating every one there is Eric decides to go to Thailand where kick boxing was created too fight the people who know it best. unfortunately for Eric Thailand decides that he should fight Tong Po the best in the country, Kurt tries to persuade Eric not to fight after he see's Tong Po warming up by kicking a brick pillar, Eric thinking hes the best decides to fight and ends up getting paralysed. of course Kurt gets annoyed by this and decides that the only way he can feel better is if he starts training in Muay Tai so he can put Tong Po through the same pain his brother went though or something like that.When Van Damme did this movie he was on the top of his game, he had great speed and strength and excellent martial arts capability, apparently he could bench press 165 kgs.The fight scenes in this movie are fantastic i especially liked the fight in the bar and the final fight between Kurt and Tong Po, this movie really shows Van Damme's talent as a martial artist mainly with Muay Tai and Kickboxing but with hints of Karate. (Van Damme was European middle weight Karate champion back in the 80's) I think if you like too watch action movies for gun fights and explosions then you probably won't like this movie, but if you like Martial arts movies with Jackie Chan,Jet Li and people like that and you fancy something different watch kick boxer This is a Damme (lol) good movie and i would recommend it.I give it 8 out of 10",8,0,0,16 August 2007
Blade," Silver hollow point filled with garlic. You aim for the head or the heart, anything else and it is yo ass!
","Blade is a great movie, definitely one of the best vampire action flick's.The vampire legend in blade has changed a lot, where as the original way to kill a vampire was to hammer a fence post size stake into it's heart, now you have silver stakes which fit in your pocket or machine pistols loaded with silver bullets, cross's don't work in this movie nether does holy water and when a vampire is killed it turns into ash.The action in Blade is brilliant Wesley Snipes is a great martial artist and he performs well, I really liked how you first meet Blade in the vampire night club not only was there a great fight scene but my first thought when i saw blade was not only how cool he looked but that he was another character worthy of being called a superhero.All clothes and weapon design for blade went together perfectly i especially liked his sword, i wasn't quite sure on his sidearm i think he should have had a Glock 18c or MP5 kurz although that would be a little awkward to draw quickly.Stephan Dorff was a disappointing bad guy no where near a match for Blade and worse than that he was pretty boring, the rest of the cast gave good performances.with all the action, good performance from Snipes and great script makes blade one of my favourite movies and best vampire slayer movie.i give it 8 out of 10.",8,0,2,27 September 2007
Resident Evil: Extinction," Great zombie movie! better than the other two.
","I was actually quite surprised at how good R E Extinction was, the other two were entertaining but didn't quite match this one i not sure why this was better though so you'll have to watch it yourself.There were a few confusions that i suffered during the movie the main one being that i wasn't aware there was a Statue of Liberty or the Effle Tower in Las Vagas, now i haven't ever been to Las Vagas before in fact i haven't been to America period so i can't comment that much apart from that i'm 99 percent sure the Effle Tower is in France. (i'm not sure where the Statue of Liberty is but i think it's on an island), For some reason they no longer have to shoot zombies in the head to kill them they only have to shoot them in the stomach of slit its throat in Millas case, Millas character of Alice was really strong in R E Apocalipse she could get thrown through a wall and get back up again where as in R E Extinction she gets a knock on the head from a ordinary guy and shes unconscious. Something i found funny was that Milla Jovovich has a new hair style which in a zombie infested world i think it would be hard to find a decent hair dresser.(Milla does look great i might add.) The fights and general action in extinction was good and the violence has stepped up a notch on the gore but not much else has changed.Resident Evil movies do take a lot out of other zombie movies but extinction does stay true to the original story of the other movies, i just wish they had brought Jill Valantine into this movie it didn't say whether she had died or separated from them or something.The characters in this movie all had very decent firearms they must have raided a gun shop or something, Milla had dual colt 45s which was cool and a lot of the other characters had glock 17s police issue in England, It was interesting that the truck driver had a SA80 assault rifle which is also English Armys chosen weapon. Resident Evil Extinction was a very good action/horror movie and i would recommend it as it does actually class as a horror since it was tense and made a lot of people in the cinema flinch. There are a lot of R E haters out there and i'm not sure why but thats just their opinion so who cares.I give Resident Evil Extinction 8 out of 10",8,2,3,12 October 2007
Gran Torino," Interesting.
","Gran Torino.I've always been a fan of Clint Eastwood with his Dirty Harry films however this is not like them at all, some of the press reviews said it was 'like Dirty Harry is back' but they are way off.Walt Kowalski (Eastwood) is an old Korean war veteran who spends his days sitting on his porch with his dog, drinking beer and swearing at his Chinese elderly neighbour who he can tell doesn't like him. Thao (Bee Vang) a young Chinese boy of The Hmong family that live next door, is very shy and quiet and is being pressured into joining a local Chinese gang, Walt doesn't want anything to do with them but as Thao's initiation is to steal his classic 1972 Ford Gran Torino and is failed by Walt and his M1 Garand, fate transpires and he ends up becoming friends with his neighbours.Eastwood owns the movie with the best lines and by far best performance, co stars were not so talented with Bee Vang as Thao and Ahney Her as Su they were mediocre at best but this is mainly i think due to having to speak another language. I recommend this for Eastwood fans but don't expect an action movie, it's all down to the script.7 out of 10",7,0,3,3 March 2009
Die Hard," The best action movie ever!
","Without a doubt this is the best action movie ever.There were a few great action movies before die hard. Dirty Harry, Mad Max and lethal weapon. (lethal weapon was made a year earlier) Dirty Harry started the real action movie genre, before that there were only westerns and second world war movies which were good but not the modern action we see today that have gun fights whilst driving cars and people running across roof tops then putting about 12 bullets in one person. Then in 1988 die hard was made and it exceeded past pretty much any action movie, and in my opinion still does. The action in die hard was brought to a new level, more bullets were fired more explosions a lot more 'drop it you mother f#####' and 'listen to me you little s###' were said which added that extra realism to Willis's characters situation,I forgot to tell you the storyline sorry! heres a brief explanation if you don't want to know the story because you want to watch it, skip the next paragraph.Lieutenant John McClane(Bruce Willis) is a New York cop who has travelled to California to see his wife at her boss's opening of the nakatomie plaza.(huge sky scraper) when he gets there he goes to have wash and unknown to every one 12 terrorists have entered the building lead by Hans Grubar(Alan Rickman) who obviously has a hidden agenda. Suddenly the terrorists burst into the party and McClane who is half way through getting dressed hears gun fire, he quickly draws his gun (9mm beretta 92F) and escapes up the stairs unnoticed, From that moment on McClane is on a race against time to save the 30 or so hostages and his wife.Not only do i like this movie for the action and suspense but the script is brilliant and the acting from all the cast is great. Bruce Willis's performance as John McClane is amazing and one of his best, he plays a very good tough guy and whenever something bad happens you care about the character, Bruce has some great one liners in this movie one of my favourites is when McClane is trying to signal a police car so he throws a dead body out the window which lands on the police car, then the camera looks up at him from just below the window and he shouts 'Welcome to the party pal' which i know dosn't sound that impressive but when you see the movie hes standing there covered in blood and dirt and holding a sub machine gun (MP5 A5) its looks quite cool. Alan Rickman is a great bad guy, he places a very smart, polite well brought up person but at the same time completely evil which is hard to to pull off but Rickman does it with style. Alexander Godunov plays Carl a henchman type character who's great, and a good match for McClane. Bonnie Bedelia plays McClane's wife she gives a good performance.With the great acting, great action and a great script makes die hard a instant classic and a must see.I give this movie 10 out of 10Heres something that will make you laugh, apparently Arnie was offered the part of John McClane and he declined, thats a very good thing.",10,1,1,17 August 2007
30 Days of Night," I was impressed.
","I have to admit i didn't have that high hopes for 30 days of night being any good, i saw the trailer and thought it looked pretty good but trailers are deceiving some times so i wasn't quite sure, so on the first showing in my local cinema on the night of Halloween i went and watched it and iv'e got to say it's definitely one of the best vampire movies i've seen. The whole movie was pretty tense and i could tell some people watching wanted it to end as soon as possible because they were scared s###less due to the gore and bits that made you jump and i have to say at times i was on the edge of my seat. Special effects weren't used that much apart from the vampires and the blood but it was all really well done and there were some very realistic decapitations and killings, the vampires were very messy eaters they kind of shook their head as they did which looked a bit weird and it made some people in the cinema laugh which i don't really think was the intension but it was all done effectively none the less.Josh Harnett who i'm not a great fan of for his acting ability performs the part of sheriff Eban well although i found it hard to believe at his age he could be a sheriff, the rest of the cast were good too and they all acted to the situation believably there were no semi auto weapons fired while diving over a table or exploding barrels or anything stupid like that it was all realistic.I really liked the birds eye view of the town when the vampires were trashing the place and killing everyone it was done brilliantly.30 days of night overall was a great horror and not a action comedy horror like so many nowadays,it was a serious horror movie with no jokes but it was entertaining and i think anyone who likes the genre and has a brain when it comes to knowing whats good will like it.7 out of 10.",7,3,5,31 October 2007
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Brilliant movie, but not for everyone.
","Now i will say without a doubt Return of the King is the best in the trilogy.The Lord of the rings trilogy has everything, action, romance, story, amazing CGI and good performances from all the cast. Unfortunately it is very slow at some parts of the movie and having read the books myself i can tell you there are huge plot holes in the story and much of it was actually changed to fit into the movie.This movie was pretty boring at some parts and a couple of my friends did fall asleep all the way up to the final 20 minutes of fight scene, one of them actually left , and i have to admit at some points i did start to nodd off.I didn't really like the character of legolas in all three movies due to fact that he was to invincible and he didn't even get dirty while fighting orcs and other demon type creatures, however the other cast and characters were done well.I think with the whole trilogy overall you ether love them or fall asleep through half of it, but they are good movies.personally though when it comes to fiction i'd rather watch Blade or Total Recall.7 out of 10.",7,2,5,29 September 2007
