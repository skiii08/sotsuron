Moneyball," Decent - But Not for the NON-Baseball Fan
","First, I disagree with those that say this is a great movie whether you are a baseball fan or not... They are wrong! I took a NON-baseball fan and if they weren't trying to stay awake they were tolerating the film 'for me'!An okay movie, but I felt it moved slow and sporadic through the story. The film had little or no excitement, which was there in the real life, that translated to the screen... by example, when I watched the film Secretariat over half the audience was on the edge of their seat during the final race and we all knew the outcome!(oh and I am not a horse race fan)The film is somewhat enjoyable, but in a Redbox or Netflix kind of way - Not one I would recommend paying premium or planning a 'date night' to see.",Null,9,19,25 September 2011
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Expectation to High?
","The movie was good, the story great, and the cinematography excellent - I suppose this was a great film; however, I didn't leave feeling it was a great film!I didn't hit me like the *Lord of The Rings* trilogy had was I anticipating it to much, expecting to much? and it just didn't live up to my expectation?I don't know, it felt slow at times giving us gaps that did nothing. We would see the beautiful world (middle earth) but there was no 'building of the story' or filling in the blanks in these 'down' periods.Maybe we are just all to familiar with 'Middle Earth' and the characters and that familiarity lends itself to boredom.Still I would recommend seeing this movie - Just don't expect to much, the anticipation might kill it.",8,2,12,17 December 2012
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Pretty Good, and I am sure there are More to come
","The movie was good, good to someone that is an apes fan - This film outpaced Tim Burtons 'Planet of the Apes' (remake - http://www.flixster.com/movie/planet-of-the-apes#!lsrc:GSR-MOV-Title) by a long shot! This remake brought the story into the modern age and opened to door for several more to be made... of course, since it is a prequel to another 'Planet of the Apes' remake. However, the continued making of these 'remakes' says a lot about the creative talent of 'Hollywood'... like there is none. If you aren't paying attention you might miss both the launch of the 'mission to mars' and the newspaper headlines 'mars mission missing'...",7,3,5,28 August 2011
Lincoln," All Should See
","Lincoln was an excellent movie about a very important figure in national history - George Washington may be the father of our nation but Lincoln held it together and kept it from collapsing while still in infancy The movie captured this pretty well, probably the best a 2.5 hour movie could!The acting was exceptional and direction superb! This should have a great Oscar night and one of the few, Oscar winning movies, I would say I actually enjoyed!My only let down was the the lack of young people seeing the movie - My wife and I were one of the youngest couples in the movie and I fear education and immigration are destroying our national identity by allowing 'the people' to forget our history!I recommend all Americans see this movie and take your children.There are some 'hollywood moments' but you will not find a better movie to start a discussion about a time in our history that was both sad and exceptional!Enjoy!",10,5,14,18 November 2012
