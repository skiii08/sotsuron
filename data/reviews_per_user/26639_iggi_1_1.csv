Blade Runner 2049," Overlong & Tiresome
","Found this to be a very pointless film that takes an age to get nowhere, the original Blade Runner movie had pace and was enjoyable to watch this edition is just terribly dull alleviated by a few neat visual tricks. To rub salt in the wound nothing much happens for hours then the climax seems rushed and incomplete, it's pants, watch something else.",3,4,6,3 May 2018
