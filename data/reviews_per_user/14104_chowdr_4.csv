Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Truly a masterpiece!
","When I went to the movie theatres to see this movie, I wouldn't think it would be this good.  I thought it was just going to tell us more about Anakin when he was young.  But when I saw this movie, I was amazed!  I saw this twice in the theatres and I'm not sick of it.  The special effects were wonderful, and the casts were great, (especially Ray Park as Darth Maul). The storyline was fairly good.  I have to say that it wasn't superb, it was average.  The other episodes of Star Wars were much better, its just that The Phantom Menace tells you more about the force, the jedi, the dark side, etc.  It also tells you more about Anakin and Queen Amidala's relationship between each other.  It tells you how they meet and how they get along. This will be good for the other prequels, episode II and III.  So overall, I rate this movie 8/10.  Not only because of the special effects, but because of the masterpiece.",7,0,0,15 October 2000
Fight Club," AMAZING!
","This movie is simply just wonderful.  My favorite movie!  As I watched this movie, I was in to it.  Edward Norton's character reminds me of me, (only the weird things that he does).  David Fincher made a good progress filming this film.  There was humour, action and suspense with all....... Well......  Go see this movie and you'll see what I mean.  I give this movie 10/10!  P.S. Rule number one about Fight Club is........  We do not talk about Fight Club.........  So less info equals better.  Just kiddding.",10,0,1,18 June 2000
X-Men," A genetically cool movie!
","This movie delivers all!  It has humour, action and a really good story line to the X-Men characters.  The first time I saw the preview, I thought it wouldn't be that good because it looks very weird because of the costumes and because of the special effects, but when I saw this movie I was stunned! This movie is simply amazing that I quickly saw it again the next day!  So if your looking for a good sci-fi movie, X-Men is the movie that you should see.",8,0,0,15 July 2000
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," My favorite Star Wars episode
","This is my favorite Star Wars episode.  This is like the most important episode in the trilogy because this is when Luke Skywalker begins to train in becoming a jedi.  Also because it first introduces Yoda and he tells you about the force.  What it is, and how to use it.  Without this episode, a lot of people will be lost.  They would be like, 'What's going to happen if Luke get's mad?'  Obi-Wan tells him to never use/get hatred because that leads to the dark side.  Also, this movie tells us a lot about Han Solo and Princess Leia, where they actually express their love towards each other.  Other than that, it tells you about Han's deal with Jaba, how he has to pay him or else.....  In Star Wars: A New Hope, it tells you this, but not as much in this movie.  So my review of this movie is that I think its the best Star Wars episode.  I give it 4.5/5.",10,0,0,17 October 2000
