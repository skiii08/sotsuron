Requiem for a Dream," Must see.
","I am happy to say this is the best film I have ever seen, The direction by Aronofsky is INCREDIBLE, realistic, touching and brilliantly implemented. Acting is superb and the plot will blow you away. Not a bad word against it. If you haven't seen it, see it. It's a tragedy that so many people see high concept films yet such brilliance gets over looked. However, I think this film is a hard watch, this is the best film I have ever seen and you see more each time you see it, the editing makes the film, but the end scenes are SO rapid. If you want a happy story this isn't it, keep scrolling, the title says it all.",10,2,4,9 November 2006
Titanic," Complete and utter trash
","Now firstly, I was impressed at the effort put into this film... HOWEVER, after seeing it, I have come to this conclusion: This would be a great movie were it not for the lack of originality, what you see here is an ancient plot line marketed on the blood of people who died in this tragedy, if you want to see a similar film, get out Romeo and Juliet (another DiCaprio film) which contains exactly the same appalling rigid acting from young Leonardo and practically the same plot line! Boy meets girl, girl already engaged or to be engaged with a fatal divide, in R+J it's the family divide (Montigues and Capulets), in titanic it is the barrier between the rich and the poor, the only reason this desecration of Shakespeares work (Romeo and Juliet + Boat) sold is because it had special effects involving the sinking of the liner 'The Titanic', THAT was it's USP, what else is there? The story? Already covered that. The acting? Hell no. A girl in one of my classes at college was praising the writer on such an imaginative story: ' How did he come up with the idea of creating this story of a large ship sinking AND adding love.' Now don't get me wrong, I wouldn't base this review on one silly girls remark, but if you reverse that, there was no creativity in it, the only creativity involved was part of the tarnishing of the past of REAL people who were on the boat, the man who shot himself for killing a passenger, IT DIDN'T HAPPEN! He gave his life to save others... Where is the conscience of the Hollywood pigs who tainted this guys past? The best part of this film was the end, and I love this film solely for the sweet consolation of the absolute poorness of this film that is the drawn out death of the character that is Jack Dawson.",1,7,14,24 September 2005
