The Blair Witch Project," True Terror
","Of all the horror films made, The Blair Witch Project touches the deepest along that most primal of human roots.  For a spartian film that shows nearly no violence the degree of terror created at the end of work is amazing.  You may leave pondering the possibility of truth in this film (as portraited by the film makers) but by the time you get home and unlock the front door you'll want all the lights on in the house.",9,1,1,27 July 1999
Underworld," Trouble suspending disbelief
","I love vampire movies and unfortunately for this flaw I will always rate said genre higher than Mr. Joe Public would care to.  In the case of this particular movie I found that I couldn't accept the ineptness of the immortals.  The werewolves at least had the cool ability to change shape, but the vampires seemed almost helpless, almost lethargic at times.  They seemed to level the playing field not with mystic power but with fully automatic weapons. Mayhap that was intentional, to show that the two species were almost identical.  I don't want to spoil the movie so I'll tread a delicate line when I say this:  the fight scene at the end was terrible...I would have greatly sacrificed the well light chamber for a dimly lit, blurry, high speed scene, more reminiscent of John Woo.That said, Kate B. does a good job of delivering her lines and even though you can't see her very well, looks stunning in that matrix style pleather jumpsuit.  The overall plot is some what predictable, but at least not worn out.As I said, I love vampire movies and I rated this 7.  If you like the genre, and can get over some of the more deeply fouled 'immortal' considerations then you'll like this movie.",7,3,5,10 May 2004
The Fast and the Furious," Ten minutes of perfection, swallowed by an hour of pain.
","What kind of movie is this?  Race Movie?  Good guy / Bad Guy movie?  Buddy Film?  The outline says it all.  It's two hundred other movies, all done better, even by Keenu Reeves in such 'classics' as Point Break. It's to be assumed that this flix was not attempting intellectual or spiritual growth from the audience only the hard 'fast' world of cars and pretty girls in a simple fuel injected plot.Trouble is, that it was a bit on the shallow side as far as hard racing and high end 'furious' motions. Though, the one and only street race scene with Brian O'Conner (LEAD: Paul Walker) does an excellent job of conveying speed and the slightly warped view of the world street racers bring to the race scene.  Rent it ONLY for this scene.I would say more about the car chases later in the film, but I don't want to spoil any plot info.  Let's just say that if this was the best hijacking game they could come up with...then they were doomed from the beginning...just like my attention.",6,0,1,19 April 2002
