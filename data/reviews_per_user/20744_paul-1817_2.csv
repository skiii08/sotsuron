Casablanca," One of the ten greatest movies ever made. ((SPOILERS))
","Round up the usual suspects! This account of the profound ambiguity at the heart of the universe grabs us dramatically, and then keeps on turning the kaleidoscope through which we see Rick and the other characters, as well as the socio-political, geopolitical, and historical context. Rick is among those blessed ones who finally make the right choice against all the odds. (But just why did he act rightly? What makes his choice the right one?) Do consequences make an action correct? Do motivations? Do both? What other aspects of person, situation, choice, decision, action, and context make an action good? Incidentally, this film brought me to my feet for the Marseillase with tears in my eyes. Usually, remembering how the French Revolution so quickly became a tyranny, and how France welcomed the invaders in the War Against the Jews, my attitude toward France, no matter how much I honor her thinkers, is lukewarm at best. During the relevant scene of the film, however, my heart is French through and through.This is a must see --- MUST SEE --- film.",10,0,2,5 February 2006
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Absolutely faithful to C. S. Lewis's vision.
","This film perfectly realized the book 'The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe' (The Chronicles of Narnia: the first chronicle). Even though I know the book by heart and know the mythology, history, and philosophy on which it is based, the film grasped me from the first moment and never let me go. After some time, perhaps the first half-hour, the tears were streaming down my face continually. The book is, of course, an allegory of the Christian myth. All the details were allegorized perfectly. Passages from the sacred scriptures of the Christians, and moments from the entire history of the Christian faith and culture, came continually into my mind as I watched the film. Here is an instance. When Peter is given his shield, the armorial bearing blazoned thereon is an emblem of Aslan. The emblem is red. Immediately into my mind leapt 'In hoc signo vinces.' The accompaniment of Aslan by Lucy and Susan, until he must go on alone, resonates beautifully with the versions of the story of the Garden of Gethsemane. Aslan's progression to the altar of sacrifice, his progressive stripping and humiliation, and the Witch's triumphant shout, 'Behold the great cat,' echoes perfectly 'Ecce homo.'",10,0,0,17 December 2005
