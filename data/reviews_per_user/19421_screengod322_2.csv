E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," E.T. proves he is indeed an alien
","this is the first in a trilogy (three movies that are part of one story, usually with the second and third films sucking) where e.t. plays an alien which is not hard for him since he is an alien. his second role in aliens is somewhat different than e.t. because he had to train for many months at a killer monster camp on a moon of jupiter to get ready for the part. the third in the sequence is close encounters of the third kind with is partially a play on words since it is the third part of the trilogy and a close encounter of the third kind is when you see an alien and make direct contact with it. seeing a ufo is of the first kind and seeing an alien from a distance is the second kind. if you happen to make out with an alien you shouldn't tell anyone as no one has of yet so there really isn't a tier for you. e.t. is stranded on earth and he is an alien botanist. the plot is basically that his species had never heard of a pine tree and they came to see one. they had not a clue that the pine cones were sharp and could cut and they ran onto the ship. e.t. had inadvertently found a pear tree and was eating the delicious 'pine cones' when his friends left him. i don't want to ruin anything so i won't let go of the rest of the story.",10,0,1,12 September 2007
The Bourne Ultimatum," Never clarified what the ultimatum was
","this movie was easily enjoyable. it stayed true with the quick cut fight scenes. the fast paced chases are also paramount in the bourne trilogy. somehow they don't really get old even though this is the third installment of the same idea.i'm also simpleminded, so i took no mental strides to make an abstract possibility out of what this ultimatum might have been. it wasn't really stated at all in the film.somehow julia stiles is cuter and cuter in each movie. early in her career i didn't think she was that cute and now i think she is that cute and maybe more. there was not much more to say about this film.",9,1,2,13 December 2007
