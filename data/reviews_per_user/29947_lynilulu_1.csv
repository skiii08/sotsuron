Blade Runner 2049," The best movie I've seen in a long time.
","Seriously, this might have topped my favorite movies. The transition from the original is seamless and unprecedented; despite the time that's passed both in and out of the movie it feels as if you're stepping in to their reality, something that feels both magical and close enough to our own to feel tangible. Really such a beautiful movie in every way. The soundtrack, cinematography, dialogue, direction, I literally couldn't criticize a single thing. I can't say enough, especially without eluding to the plot, but I wholeheartedly recommend this film; not just as an adequate sequel, but in my honest opinion, a movie that has surpassed the original. If you can, please go see it in the theater; it really amplifies the beautifully done atmosphere of this astounding movie.That said, fair warning to those with seizure disorders, you may want to consider waiting to view this at home. There is a scene in the movie that lasts... maybe five to ten minutes(?) that caused me to have two seizures. It's a great scene, but there are strobing lights that could be potentially triggering, so please be careful.",10,8,17,12 October 2017
