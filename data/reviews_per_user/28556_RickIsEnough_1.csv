Alien 3," Must be experienced with an open mind.
","Alien 3 might have passed through some horrendous production, with all the odds against it coming forth and maybe just because the people wanted to capitalize on the past success. This should not influence in one's opinion about its quality. The making of this movie could be analogous to an invalid man winning a running race against some very good and healthful racers. Still we should appreciate the quality of the final product independently, and it's a winner by itself. Don't go in expecting to see the same kind of argument there is on the first two movies, this is as much a change on the franchise as it was 'aliens' to 'alien'. It presents conceivable ideas in a very skillful way. If you can watch it beyond your preconceptions, you will doubtlessly enjoy it, as you would enjoy a fantastic dream (or nightmare if you are like me, who sees them as exciting and dangerous fiction that doesn't hurt you at any given moment)",8,2,7,10 May 2009
