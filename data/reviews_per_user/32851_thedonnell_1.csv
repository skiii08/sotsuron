Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Way too scripted!
","This was pretty poor! Having been a Borat fan for quite a while now I was really looking forward to this movie. However, I think trying to add a story was a mistake! Seeing Borat interacting with scripted characters is wrong. For me it works best when he interviews unsuspecting victims. The whole thing felt too scripted for me and trying to hold together some scripted interviews with a paper thin story wasn't the direction to take him in. Surely a collection of 'real' interviews would have been more effective. But then I suppose its Sacha Baron Cohen's character and he can do what he likes.If you like everything to be obvious go see it!",3,1,3,17 March 2007
