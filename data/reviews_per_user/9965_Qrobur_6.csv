The Lobster," Leaden, juvenile and dreary nonsense
","Is it a satire? Is it a drama? Is it a comedy? No, it's an earthbound turkey.Yorgos Lanthimos appears to be a director in the mould of Roy Andersson, that is, somebody who has mistaken miserabilist absurdism for profundity and who literally projects it at us on the narcissistic assumption that we all think the same. Fortunately, most of us do not.'The Lobster' is a failure for a number of reasons. First, a satire is supposed to point out the absurdity of a state of affairs by depicting it absurdly but recognisably. However, nowhere in this film, except towards the very end, is there a relationship that is at all recognisable, absurdly contorted or otherwise. If 'The Lobster' is a satire, it misses its mark because it's not clear at what mark it aims. Secondly, is it a comedy? If you conceive of a comedy as something that makes you laugh, chuckle, smile or even is a little amusing, 'The Lobster' is not a comedy. There is a complete dearth of humour in this film; black, dark, twisted, absurd or any other kind. Thirdly, is it a drama? Well maybe, in a thin, unsatisfying manner. Of course, this film has no substantial dénouement so I'd argue it's not a drama. 'The Lobster' has another debilitating flaw. It appears to be two films and it's hard to avoid the impression the second half has been tacked onto the first because the director and writers had little idea what to do with the original material.So, what is 'The Lobster'? In passing, there is some decent cinematography and Ireland is made to look sternly beautiful on these occasions. However, above all what 'The Lobster' is, is absurd. Regrettably, this isn't the kind of absurdity that has something to say about the human condition. It's the kind of absurdity that is preposterous and uninteresting.I think it's absurd this film was made. It appears to be the product of an immature mind with an inchoate understanding of human relationships. The result is dismally boring.",4,8,13,23 March 2016
American Sniper," This is a disgrace of a film
","First, let me say that Eastwood's direction, Cooper's acting and the screenplay are all competent. Were this film a wholly fictional account of a warrior with special skills put in the service of his comrades it would be quite serviceable, though no more than that.However, here was an opportunity to show the complexities of a man hailed as an American hero; and by complexities, I mean the thoroughly odious aspects of Chris Kyle's character. The man enjoyed killing people, regarding his targets as savages, and he bragged about killing looters in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina - even if he didn't, because we don't know for certain, what kind of man declares proudly his murderous inclinations? In short, he was far from a good man. Dismally, you would never know this from the simple-minded depiction of him as an all American Hero in Eastwood's film.Likewise, there is not a shred of awareness in the film that the US involvement in Iraq might have been illegal and was certainly catastrophic for the Iraqis. The film's approach is to display every Iraqi man, woman and even child as intent on murdering 'good' American troops and therefore deserving of their fate, both at the end of Kyle's rifle and under the boot of American troops generally.I don't know what Eastwood was thinking when he made this film. Perhaps he saw an easy way to make money by appealing to the misplaced patriotism of some Americans. What I do know is that this is a disgusting film.",1,2145,3660,13 January 2015
The Theory of Everything," This is a work of fiction, not a biography
","Let me state the good things about 'The Theory Of Everything'. First, Eddie Redmayne does an excellent job of conveying the progressive degeneration of Stephen Hawking's condition. Felicity Jones is good, if a touch too saintly, as Jane Hawking. Secondly, the storyline of the film is formulaic but competent. This makes 'The Theory Of Everything' pleasant, occasionally funny and occasionally emotionally involving.It is neither Redmayne's nor Jones' fault that that their parts bear only a passing similarity to the people they are depicting. However, it is wholly the writers' fault that the story departs grossly from Jane Hawking's book, upon which the film is said to be based, in several places. Characters are invented, scenes that never took place are interpolated into the story and some real events are shifted in time for purely dramatic effect in a way for which not even Stephen Hawking could provide a proof! In short, 'The Theory Of Everything' has to be taken as mostly a fictional representation of the lives of the Hawkings.If you go to see this film simply to be entertained and don't mind whether or not what you see is accurate, then you will be entertained. However, if like me you dislike wondering whether or not one scene is reasonably true to the facts but the next one is an invention - or vice versa, or that both are true, or that both are fictional - you may be irritated.I find it troubling that so many films purporting to depict the lives of real people or historical events distort the truth with a total disregard for the consequences of spreading what, in effect, are lies. 'The Theory Of Everything' falls squarely into this unedifying category.",6,2,3,3 January 2015
Frozen," Far from a Disney classic
","I've rated this film 5 out of 10 for the following reasons: 1) The narrative is disjointed.2) The music is forgettable. Some of the lyrics are distractingly inept.3) The classic 'good versus evil' theme of Disney films is badly handled. Prince Hans' transition from good to evil is thoroughly unconvincing. Queen Elsa's hovering between love of power and love of others is similarly so.4) The sidekicks — specifically the snowman and the reindeer — who, as usual, are intended to provide moments of humour and to point up what is good are one-dimensional, with the snowman in particular being irritating.5) The animation is no more than so-so in quality. It's time animators stopped relying on the kind of facial distortions found in Japanese comics, e.g. oversize eyes, unfeasibly round cheeks and turned up noses. These have become clichés.I understand some backwards Americans have criticised the film for promoting homosexuality. This is arrant nonsense. It is merely a pale shadow of the glorious Disney films of yesteryear.",5,50,99,26 April 2014
Children of Men," The baby is a miracle, but 'Children Of Men' is stillborn
","There's no explanation as to why the planet's women have been afflicted with infertility. There's no explanation of how just one woman has become pregnant after 18 years without a child being born. There's no explanation of why the miraculously pregnant woman must reach something called the 'Human Project'. There's no explanation of why, at this time, the activists are trying to stage an uprising. There's no explanation of why they need, or think they need, the pregnant woman's baby in order for their uprising to succeed. There's no explanation of why the UK, albeit transformed into a fascist society, alone of the Western nations seems to have avoided falling into a state of anarchy.So, we're left with a simple jeopardy film set against a sea of unexplained circumstances. The hero fights to transport the pregnant woman to a boat whilst being hunted by both government forces and the would-be revolutionaries; he succeeds but at the cost of his own life and those of his friends. The first half of the film plods along whilst it puts a few plot devices in place. The second is faster paced and generates a modicum of tension. However, at the end you are left thinking 'what was all that for and what happened next?'.It's almost as if somebody scripted a great story about a dystopian future and somebody else was briefed to strip all the interesting stuff away and leave a fairly brainless 'damsel in distress' film in its place. What results is a poor, poor effort.",5,8,12,1 August 2014
The Imitation Game," Fine acting but an highly inaccurate story
","The story of the breaking of the German ciphers during WWII is a significant one, deserving of an accurate telling. The story of Alan Turing, a key member of the team that developed the methods and machines that broke those ciphers is an important one, also deserving of an accurate telling.'The Imitation Game' is neither of these films. The story told by this film is watchable, Cumberbatch renders Turing sympathetically and, somewhat to my surprise, Knightley takes the thinly written role of Joan Clarke and turns it into something with a fair bit of heft. However, this film's story takes such liberties with the facts that it really cannot be recommended. This is *not* how the German ciphers were broken and it is not even a reasonable depiction of Turing's life, particularly so when it comes to the atrocious way he was treated after the war.You will not find Harold Keen or Gordon Welchman in this film, the writers preferring to insinuate that Turing was wholly responsible for the design and building of the bombe machines (except that Hugh Alexander is credited with the idea for improving their working that was actually Welchman's). However, you will find a Soviet spy in Turing's hut when in fact he did not work there. I could go on and list other inaccuracies.If you are unaware of the stories of Enigma and Turing, you may find this a quite interesting film to watch. If you are aware of these stories I think you may find it difficult to swallow the gross misrepresentations of both.I consider that filmmakers, when depicting real people or events, have a responsibility to tell the truth and not distort things simply for dramatic effect. When this responsibility is ignored the filmmakers have decided to, in effect, spread lies in the name of entertainment. 'The Imitation Game' may be entertaining but it makes this dismal mistake and cannot be recommended.",6,101,137,1 January 2015
