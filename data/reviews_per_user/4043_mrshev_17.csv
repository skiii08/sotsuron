Skyfall," Very good Bond film.
","(As everyone knows, it's a Bond film, so you do have to suspend a certain amount of disbelief - that should be an automatic tick-box on entry to the cinema.)Skyfall starts like a typical Bond, right in the heart of the action: chase scene, pretty girl and a glamorous location. It's beautifully choreographed and shot and gets proceedings off to a great start. This scenes sets up the rest of the film and leads us towards the thrilling climax.So, the bad:The middle section of this film is far too plodding. The story is not strong enough to justify the time spent telling it and I would have liked to have seen some sharper editing here. At 143mins this is a long film.There are some pretty large plot holes that left me scratching my head a bit and I find that a little strange that they were not thought through in a $200m production. There were also some large continuity and production errors that made me wince a bit.But, the good:The final section is, in my opinion, one of the best endings to any Bond. He shows resourcefulness, tenacity and expertise. The setting is wonderful and it fills in a tiny bit of Bond back history which is a new thing and actually handled rather well. The cinematography is universally great in this film. Wonderful lighting and locations and almost painterly in places.Judi Dench is wonderful. A proper villain. He's bonkers and brilliant and just steals the scenes.Rather good titles and title song by Adele. Brings back memories of Shirley Bassey.Overall: I enjoyed it. It was a bit long and could have lost some pounds in the middle section (couldn't we all?) but I thought it was up there with Casino Royale as one of my favourite Bond movies. Daniel Craig is an excellent Bond and Mendes obviously relished making this movie because of the care gone into it...which begs the question: why production errors and plot holes!?",7,3,11,15 November 2012
Deja Vu," Daft but fun
","There is a lot going for this movie. It is well made, well shot, well acted and well directed. As thrillers go I think that Mr Scott pretty much does a masterclass in thriller directing. Obviously, once you take a leap into the void that is temporal displacement / time travel mechanics then you are opening yourself up to a whole bunch of nightmare scripting sessions in which the writers must have leaned one way to make it work in a logical way but the producers must have been sighing all the time; 'boring! Too much exposition - we want action, dammit!' and leaned the other way. What we have ended up with is a film started by the writers and finished by the producers.It is entertaining but when the film ends you end up thinking: 'I dunno, that doesn't make any sense...' and unfortunately what started out as quite a clever idea gets crazier and crazier as the film progresses and by the end I was pretty sure that no one had any idea where - or indeed when - Denzel Washington was, least of all the writers. Overall, it's fun and for the first half an hour or so you are wondering where they are going with it and it becomes immediately apparent that it is going to be quite a bit of fun...but then goes a bit bonkers. Worth a watch though.",5,1,3,19 April 2016
The Hunger Games," Excellent Adaptation
","Adapted from the book of the same name I found myself constantly comparing the book to the film - that is inevitable - and because of that I struggled to separate the book from the film. The film is very faithful to the book (even though it obviously has to cut a few corners in terms of narrative) and this is both to it's credit and to it's detriment. On one hand the book is great and veering away from that would be a mistake...on the other hand if you had read the book then it felt a little bit like a dramatisation of the novel scene-for-scene and as I imagine most of the audience would have already read the book it becomes somewhat predictable. There is also the problem that the romantic stage play that Catniss is part of is very much a battle of conscience for her in the novel but is portrayed as a simple love story in the movie.That being said I liked the way the film was shot and the sombre colour palette used - that was a bit of a surprise. I thought the acting was very good and the realisation of The Capital and the actual arena were skilfully crafted and well thought out - they were almost as I imagined them. It's just that I can recall a few novel adaptations that enhanced their origins; Harry Potter, Misery, Blade Runner, The Shining, One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest - all were adaptations that resulted in films that were very watchable whether you had read the book or not...because they were great films. I still remember being shocked, surprised and delighted watching these films even though I knew the story. So although this is a very, very good film it is not the best book adaptation I have ever seen.",7,0,3,25 October 2012
Spotlight," Super film
","It won best film, deservedly so. This is a film that resonated with me long after I watched it. The complicated tale of the investigation of paedophile priests in Boston and the publication of it is told in riveting fashion by Tom Macarthy who does not waste a frame or a scene to anything less than the plot or character development. I never felt the running time or in any way disbelieved any of the actors in their portrayals.Keaton seems to be on a total roll at the moment and he is excellent as the head of Spotlight but the whole ensemble seemed to put in a real shift. This felt like a documentary at times and I could feel the audience around me leaning forward as each new revelation is uttered. Just brilliant.",10,63,79,29 March 2016
The Revenant," Rocky II in the Woods
","There is a lot to like in The Revenant. The cinematography is jaw dropping and the landscape is a character in it's own right - the camera work is excellent throughout, with some real bravura camera moments. The camera work makes one feel intimate with the action and one goes through the horrific series of events that Glass endures. A special mention for the sound design, which I thought was sublime. I felt that that the filmmakers were trying to capture the time in all of it's brutality and I think that they managed that with a combination of expert editing, grading and production design.DiCaprio is great, in a grunty kind of way - I don't think it's his best performance by far but I think he was due an Oscar. I thought Tom Hardy was much better and it took me a while to actually register it was him at all. I had no problem with understanding the dialogue - a common complaint, it seems - and thought that the mumbled and incoherent utterances of the trappers was in-keeping with the period.There is a fair amount of digital work here that is sometimes excellent (the bear scene) and sometimes not (the herd of Buffalo). But I imagine there was way more as some of the shots must have been impossible without - which means they were outstanding in that I couldn't spot them.The main issue is that this is not a very complicated movie. For all the needless shots of running water and leaves shot through with shafts of light, this was - essentially - Rocky II. He gets beat up, left for dead and comes back for revenge in a classic re-birth storyline (I lost count at 3 at the amount of times he emerged out of some kind of chrysalis...). I don't have a problem with that but in order to give weight to this the film- makers added 45 minutes of 'meanwhile back at the ranch...' shots that broke the flow. If you accept that this is a simple, brutal story and nothing more then you will enjoy it. But maybe only the once. But that bear scene is awesome.",7,0,2,6 May 2016
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," The Series Back to it's best
","Mission: Impossible seemed to have lost it's way somewhat. The first one was great, number 2 was a bit of a train wreck. The third was much better and I wasn't sure about Ghost Protocol - but many liked it.Rogue Nation is definitely MI back to it's best. The whole film is a total roller-coaster ride from start to finish with no real slumps and all I kept thinking was: why isn't Bond this good? The action jumps from one great location to another and each one is used to good effect and I never felt that they traveled to a locale for improbable reasons. There is a definite lack of tech in this movie and I felt that was for the good. Tom Cruise is back to form and if he - as per usual - doing a lot of his own stunts then I hope his insurance company wasn't watching.There are quite a few stand out scenes from the movie but for me the car chase in the middle is one of the best shot chase scenes in ages with only minimal CGI. There are few gripes with the film - the cast is good and it was good to see Simon Pegg shedding his comic sidekick role and becoming more an integral part of the team. Overall: a huge amount of fun and a proper action film like we haven't had in a while.",8,1,3,20 March 2016
Coco," Pixar goes Disney
","Maybe it's just me, but Pixar seemed to do no wrong for a long time a produced a string of movies that were simply wonderful. That run seemed to come to an end when they made Cars 2 and they have been pumping out some pretty average movies ever since.What made Pixar great was the marriage of stellar animation, peerless storytelling and emotional manipulation. Up still gets me every time. What was missing was originality and emotion because, let's face it, everyone else has caught up animation wise. Coco sees Pixar back in form if not on top form.The animation is gorgeous (as you would expect) but it is the emotional connection of the family that makes it work (Pixar is back!) and the songs are truly super (Disney showing their input). It bears an uncanny resemblance to The Book of Life (2014) - which is also a great movie - but Coco does the whole voyage and return with real verve and the journey carries you along without any pause to draw breath and my daughter was in tears many time and even I got a little grit in my eye now and again.Great to see Pixar back in the zone and I hope that they can push on and get back to their best.",8,0,1,13 January 2018
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Original take and perspective of the holocaust
","The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas tries to re-imagine the tale of the holocaust though told from the viewpoint of an 8 year old son of a Nazi commandant. His growing friendship with a boy (in striped pyjamas) is a lens through which we see the horrible stereotypes and attitudes held at the time. This perspective gives us a fresh look at a subject covered many times before.I have read the book and the friendship felt a little more natural in print, but nevertheless the film sucks you in mainly because of the great work of Asa Butterfield as Bruno and a strong supporting cast. The period is captured beautifully* and the disparity between the lives the the commandant's family and that of the camp inmates is stark and something that resonates (I have visited a concentration camp and this was the case there as well...). * My main gripe are that I would have preferred the film to be played by German actors in German. It doesn't matter how much effort you put into period details and uniforms and re-creating Berlin with all the posters and Nazi insignia - if everyone is speaking like they just dropped out of a Downton Abbey set then it kind of destroys the illusion. Yes they acted well, but it felt so awkward to me that I really felt the film suffered as a result. I don't imagine this would have been released as a AAA blockbuster so releasing it as a German language film seems sensible. Tarantino managed to make a film with German, French and English spoken - why couldn't this be the same? Frustrating.",7,0,0,29 March 2016
Brave," A Celtic Departure for Pixar
","I kind of missed all the marketing hullabaloo when this was in the cinema and so watched this hype free, with my kids, curled up on the sofa eating popcorn. As ever the animation is sumptuous and Pixar really are peerless when it comes to this kind of stuff but I don't think it has escaped their - or our - notice that all the other animation studios have caught up in that department; is it any better that How to Train Your Dragon? Or Tangled? I do wonder...the hair is great, the Highland setting is detailed in a way that that shows utter dedication to one's craft. I still think Pixar are at the top of the league, though.The thing, however, that defines a Pixar movie for me is that the animation is almost secondary to the dialogue, characters and plot. I liked it. I thought the characters were clearly defined and funny, beautifully designed with superb voice acting. My kids sometimes got a touch lost with the plot (I found myself scratching my head a couple of times to be honest) but overall they adored the story and got swept up in the final third of the film.This is not one of Pixar's best movies - it's a bit of a Ratatouille (which I love BTW) in that it seems to struggle to play to both audiences, to adults and children alike. My kids loved it and I really liked it as well. Would I see it again? Yeah, I probably would, but there is a certain something missing from this movie and I think that it is a bit of emotion. I didn't fall in love with any of the characters like Woody...or Wall-E...or grouchy Mr Fredricksen. There is a tiny spark of Pixar magic missing from this film...but it's still a great film",8,1,2,17 November 2012
The Dark Knight," Very, very good batman
","Only just watched this and I like where the Batman franchise has been going. Been a bit grittier and a bit more respectful of it's comic book heritage.This outing sees the Joker (back again) trying to wrest control of the criminal underworld (which has been severely curtailed by Batman and an ambitious and brave DA) of Gotham by vowing to destroy their nemesis - namely, Batman. The plot meanders at times but I liked the central theme of the film: what separates the good guys from the bad guys. The Joker is like the house dealer giving characters hard choices and trying to see what makes people better by the choices they make. It's an interesting dynamic and I think it transforms the film from your average superhero film into something more. It is where the Marvel franchises suffer in comparison, IMHO.What really elevates this film to another level (to a level where the action is actually the dull bit) are the performances of Heath Ledger (The Joker) and Aaron Eckhart (Harvey Dent). Heath Ledger is by far and away the best portrayal of The Joker so far. An interesting, charismatic and scary individual - Ledger seems to walk the line of parody and insanity with ease and I found The Joker to be utterly enthralling and horrific at the same time - he is mesmerising every time he is on screen.Eckhart takes a while to grow into the role but towards the end of the film I found him to be excellent as well.I still find that Bale having a regular voice when he is Wayne to then having a I-Smoke-40-Malboros-a-day voice as Batman is a bit weird.",8,0,3,27 April 2013
Up," Probably one of Pixar's best.
","If you were to pitch this story to a major film studio you'd have asphalt burns on your butt from when you hit the pavement: a boy meets a girl who shares her spirit of adventure, but adventure takes a back seat as life takes over and then unfulfilled he ends up lonely and old living in a house. Facing eviction he ties millions of balloons to his house so that he can fly to Peru. Russell, an earnest boy scout, accidentally follows him on his quest to find his dead wife's dream but then, together, they make new ones...First things first. This is Pixar. The animation is wonderful. The art direction is sublime. The attention to detail is simply jaw dropping. It is a film that Blueray was designed for. I saw it in the cinema the first time and that really is the way to see this film.The plot (as I have ineptly tried to summarize above) is fiendishly clever and you know where it is going but it doesn't matter. Some elements of the storyline are never fully explained and it is for you to work them out and I liked that. They're not rocket science, but it's nice not to be spoon fed.The voice acting is wonderful and special mention should go to Edward Asner (who plays the lead) and Bob Peterson (who plays Doug). They bring the characters alive in a way that animation cannot.The thing that sets this film apart is the subtext. Dream fulfillment. Regret. Grief. Anthropomorphisation. Adventure. Progress. I could go on. There is so much in this film it is amazing. This, however, makes it sound like a film for adults only but that is not true. My kids (4 & 6) adored it and laughed throughout, cowered at the exciting bits and shed a tear or two here and there.Talking of tears the first 15mins of this film are brutal. Heart strings pulled, plucked and finally snapped. Makes Bambi look like a romcom...",10,0,1,27 April 2013
Mudbound," Grim tale of racism and agricultural life
","My favourite thing about this movie is tone. At every stage this movie just manages to get the tone right. Whether that is the dialogue, the framing or the audio. Because of this the film pulls you right in and the running time flies by because I felt completely immersed in wartime Mississippi and the struggles of the two families. Their faults and mistakes are laid bare with no real exposition from the actors to lead you to think or make a judgement, that is left to you. I found that the entire ensemble were excellent, showing real restraint and giving their characters real heft.Overall, a great movie and one that should not be missing. Well done, Netflix, more of the this!",9,1,4,13 January 2018
Whiplash," Mesmerising journey of a young drummer.
","Drumming! Really! Who knew it could be so exciting. This is a superb film with standout performances at every stage and the script fizzes off the screen continually self referencing and catching the arcs as you spot them and they come to fruition - this is a masterclass in how to pen a screenplay.The whole film is shot lo-fi and there is an intimate and almost voyeuristic nature to the filmmaking which I really liked. You practically want to punch the air at many times during the film and sometimes punch J.K Simmons (who is AMAZING). I found myself tapping along to the music and at one point (along with the rest of the cinema) nearly jumped out of my seat and the whole experience felt like a roller-coaster ride from start to finish.Great film, cannot recommend it enough.",10,0,1,11 January 2015
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," A lot to like in this Movie
","Let's get this out of the way: this is a good movie. You will enjoy it and it is beautifully made, acted and written. Keaton is excellent and holds the movie together but notable mentions must go to Edward Norton (nearly stealing the show entirely) and Emma Stone (who is better than I have ever seen her). The whole single shot (with some hidden cuts) thing is great and I loved the setting and Keaton's honest performance.Are there issues? Yeah. The script starts off subtle and suggestive, the concept of mental illness is handled well and I felt as if I was in Keaton's head a bit but later on I was a bit: 'I get it!' but the film telegraphs the plot and the metaphors too much and I felt like I was being lectured to a bit...in the end this spoils what was a great film.Did it deserve the Oscar? For me, no. I think Boyhood should have got the nod.",8,0,3,10 March 2015
The Big Short," Great movie about the sub-prime economic collapse
","The Big Short tells the story of a bunch of investment brokers as they un-earth the house of cards like financial products that the big banks sold, re-packed, sold and re-packed again. The story is told in a documentary style that frequently breaks the fourth wall and takes time out of the narrative to explain some of the more technical stuff in easy to digest minuets that keep the narrative going. Everyone - essentially - acts their socks off with Steve Carrel knocking it out of the park on many occasions. Gosling gets top billing (and I don't think I have heard him speak so much dialogue before...) and he is great but more of a support and Christian Bale puts in another solid performance as a socially challenged fund manager. My only gripe about the film is that the investors are made out to be quasi hero's, highlighting the fraudulent and despicable actions of the investment banks - but they really are just as bad as the banks; profiting off the eventual plight of millions of people just trying to get by. They showed no inclination to maybe visit the FDA or the government and give them a heads up on the catastrophe just waiting to happen in the hope that they could either avert it or at least throw a few people into jail...That aside, this is a very good film and worth the 2 hours running time.",9,0,0,20 March 2016
Prometheus," Nice visuals, bad everything else.
","I have a lot of time for Ridley Scott. He has made a long list of wonderful films. He has the skill to create movies that dazzle, frighten you and make you think.Prometheus, though, is not one for the resumé.It's a prequel of sorts - but this seems unclear when watching the film and I gained no further insight into the 'Alien' universe than I did without watching the film. There are a number of similarities to Alien but whereas the Alien crew were bored, travel hardened, cynical space truckers the crew of Prometheus...well, they are a strange mix of people. Certainly, I wouldn't have picked them as a crew to investigate something so unimaginably important.This is one area that the film fails. The crew are a type of action piñata - merely there to be whacked and disposed of as the plot sees fit. It's as if no time went into their development as it was not deemed worth it, when they were needed as nothing other that set dressing. They also do not make meaningful sense as a crew on a research ship - people on research ships tend to be passionate, methodical and pragmatic. This crew have none of that.The second area where the film fails is the plot. It is a veritable Swiss cheese of plot holes, cul-de-sacs and blind alleys. Not only do minor details fail to add up but the entire plot - the hook upon which this carcass is hung - is just a shambles. A kind of moronic, smörgåsbord of ideas that make no actual sense when you start thinking about it after you have left the cinema. I understand that one of the writers from Lost was involved - and that explains a lot.The visuals, however, are fantastic. From the Prometheus itself to the gorgeous rolling alien landscapes - all of it is a feast for the eyes. Finally, special mention needs to go to Noomi Rapace, Idris Elba and Michael Fassbender who almost single handedly keep the show on the road. Whilst the plot holes, miscasting and dubious scientific research turn this movie into a Carry On film they gamely lean on their significant acting ability and soldier on.So, 5 out of 10 - why Scott didn't put this through a writers workshop is beyond me though!",3,3,6,19 November 2012
50_50," A very good film indeed
","The problem with this film is that it starts quite badly. The comedy is a little mis-firing and I felt the tone was a bit off. I liked the run up to the main story but it sometimes felt a little forced and just..off.BUT, once the film gets into it's stride it is marvelous. Joseph Gordon-Levitt gets better and better as the film progresses and what starts off as a somewhat awkward performance grows into a rather fine portrayal of a young man dealing with life threatening illness. Anna Kendrick puts in an excellent turn as a bumbling trainee counselor and helps to push the film to a satisfying conclusion. Seth Rogan is...Seth Rogan, as ever and he provides light - if somewhat crude - relief from the subject matter. But he seriously needs to expand his acting repertoire.This is a well made and quite emotional film. I lost both my parents to cancer and could relate to a lot of the scenes and sentiments portrayed. The only thing I still don't get is when portraying cancer patients undergoing chemo why they don't get rid of the eyebrows? Chemo tends to not be selective!Overall a great film that is worth watching.",9,0,0,10 November 2012
