Captain Phillips," A Story So Compelling, it is More Than Worth Telling
","A story so compelling and worth telling, Captain Phillips is the biographical account of one Captain Richard Phillips' actions in response to a hijacking by Somali pirates on his cargo ship in 2009. Despite accusations of the film's depiction of real events as misleading, as a standalone piece, Paul Greengrass' thrilling direction and Tom Hanks' phenomenal performance combine for one of 2013's most surprising, intense and breathtaking cinematic offerings.The less you know about the factual events going into Captain Phillips, the more enhanced the experience of seeing a recreation of others' experiences will be, due to the surprising turns and uncertainty of the film's climactic moments.The severe intensity and feeling of insecurity shroud your senses throughout the 134 minute duration of Captain Phillips. Like watching Breaking Bad, the sensations that the film evokes in you are indescribable, plentiful and so miscellaneous, causing you to become a servant to Greengrass' masterful filmmaking. This is how a biographical drama should feel: real, regardless of the fact that most watching will never experience the actions represented on screen.An area in which the film arguably lacks is in its treatment of the sensitivity of piracy as less of a one-dimensional issue as it can often be perceived. While the themes around the social issues of Somali piracy are present, they are not entrenched into the narrative as the most memorable aspect of the film. More so, the film emphasises and brings attention to piracy more broadly as a global issue to be taken seriously. Prior to the intense hijacking sequences, Hanks, as Phillips, is consistently undermined in his concerns about the threat of piracy upon the MV Maersk Alabama, until of course the ship is successfully boarded by the four pirates. Captain Phillips favours thriller over drama, intensity over the propensity of piracy for many, but this by no means is a downfall for the film, just an observation I've spent too long writing about so let's move on.Hanks' portrayal as the seemingly heroic Captain is not only one of his most memorable, but one of the most unforgettable performances in recent history. It is literal insanity how tremendously the actor clutches us all in to his character's palm, in order to give us an almost POV seat into the tribulations of his character. In addition to the film's perfect pacing, Tom Hanks' portrayal completely makes you lose track of time as your awareness is at one with the film's pace; you go wherever the Captain or Captor Abduwali Muse (brilliantly played by Barkhad Abdi) go. The film's concluding scene alone is a triumph in cinema, in acting and in emotional expression as Hanks delivers a heart-wrenching, throat- lumping and tear-inducing performance, so powerful it almost makes his acting throughout the rest of the film seem like a school play, but not quite...or at all. Though not executed perfectly, Captain Phillips brings to light the darkness and seriousness of piracy. With a heavier concentration on Richard Phillips and its thriller genre, the biography based on the book by the Captain is a heart-pounding survival film that leaves you sweating, in awe and only able to reclaim your breath once the credits begin to scroll. In spite of the numerous bodily functions the film's wonderful score, masterful direction, talented actors and overall experience have you performing, they are functions worth having. Exhaustingly intense, Captain Phillips is an undoubted contender for the year's most outstanding feature.",9,1,2,22 December 2013
Skyfall," JaMes Bond
","Despite at times being convinced I was consuming a prolonged commercial for Sony electronics, the 23rd Bond instalment exceeds the expectations in almost every way possible. Rather than tick off everything the film did well and express Minor negative criticism, I will instead proceed to articulate the most intriguing aspects of this thoroughly enjoyable addition to the James Bond collection.At this point, the almost tired description of Skyfall as an unconventional exploration of the character is certainly still worth noting. Take the usual narrative formula of an international threat, which requires prevention from MI6. Does this film consist of this remedy? To a certain degree, one could argue yes, but for the Most part, Skyfall perpetuates unknown personality to both 007 and M, Meaning we discover the history of these characters, resulting in our narrative as having a relatable persona, as opposed to the conservative Manner of previous films in the franchise. We see an alternative representation of the heroes, as broken in their strive for righteousness, and this film does not deal with opposing principles of good vs. evil in the generic sense. Neither our protagonist nor villain, convey the standard characteristics of their roles. The antagonist most notably, sensationally portrayed by Javier Barden, is not one of complete Malevolence in that we as the audience express a particular empathy towards his character, due to the corruption at the hands of the supposed good in the British Secret Service. This makes for a compelling yet simple plot for revenge.It could possibly prove more complementary to derive comparisons between Skyfall and Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy. This is due to the overwhelming similarities between Bond 23 and Nolan's take on the comic- book hero. Both suffer severe Mental and physical trauma and are in both respects broken to the extent of becoming incapable of reaching the valiant level they once attained. We also see a darker tone in usually upbeat franchises, making the audience revise exactly what these characters stand for. There are many other resemblances between the two, such as Musical score, narrative structure and villainous authority; though to entrench those into this review may dilute my appreciation for Skyfall as an individual film. While previous contemporary Bond instalments May have been lacking in the vintage substance from the perspective of older audiences, Skyfall imbeds Many new and classical conventions of a Bond picture to accommodate to almost any audience. For instance, we see the introduction of various, previously absent characters that play a fundamental role to the achievements of James Bond's objective, with a Modern twist that accomplishes both a humorous and relevant contribution to the film's success. Furthermore, the notorious accompaniment of a 'Bond Girl' has received its criticism in light of more accepting feminist ideologies throughout the fifty-year history of 007. Considering this, Skyfall and arguably all three of Daniel Craig's Bond films, have assimilated for of a significant female association with the projects, without of course forgetting the unnecessary sexual scenes with highly attractive exotic women.Having not been fortunate to view all 23 films based on the internationally recognised character, I May only regard this as a great Bond picture, relative to the few others I have seen. It does not quite elevate above Casino Royale (2006) in terms of overall enjoyment, but Makes a sensational attempt at becoming a refreshing embodiment for a new style of narrative and tone that will likely not only be remembered for being one of 2012s Most Memorable cinematic triumph, but perhaps even the decade. This latest feature of the franchise embarks on a great deal of wondrous engagement and consistency, as it never leaks a dull taste even throughout the fairly long 143 Minute time period.Favourite sequence: The most outstanding segment is oddly the opening title sequence, whereby we acquire brief narrative explanation, excellent fluidity in CG (computer graphics) as well as the accompaniment of the title song by Adele, which if you are not classically conditioned to after taking in the establishing credits, then perhaps I am not 'Someone Like You'.",8,0,6,22 November 2012
Iron Man 3," Stark Embarks on Top Marks and Malarkey
","Only can I truly express my feelings towards Iron Man 3 by spoiling the plot, which 'iron'ically spoiled the film for me. To not do so would simply be an insult to my own opinion.Iron Man 3 initiates what many have categorised as the second phase in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, leading up to Avengers 2. It picks up from where the Avengers left off in 2012, though Tony Stark himself is having difficulty picking himself up following the events of the hugely successful collaborative superhero film. One of the great features of Iron Man 3 is seeing Robert Downey Jr. portray a broken character, whose psyche has been damaged seemingly beyond repair, despite his ingenious ability to create and repair machines of inconceivable abilities. While albeit a convenience in the film's concluding chapter, the manner in which Tony Stark occupies his mind still makes for an intriguing character, played by an actor who has developed in each of his cinematic appearances so superbly that it is unimaginable that any other performer regardless of talent, would dare step into the Iron Man suit following Downey Jr.Undeniably entertaining, you don't have time to contemplate on whether it may be vaguely indulgent and forced due to how compelling the action sequences really are. The IMAX experience just emphasises the captivatingly choreographed superhero set pieces so exhilaratingly that you feel so far on the edge of your seat, you'll probably end up a few rows ahead of where you were originally sitting. However, our attention is only preoccupied by pure entertainment in part. The other element of our conscious captivity regards the film's primary villain, The Mandarin. Ben Kingsley's fear inducing antagonist provides a contemporary and terrorising villainous milestone, yet to be achieved by any Iron Man, and perhaps even Marvel cinematic adversary. Unlike its predecessors, Iron Man 3 appeared to have succeeded in creating a phenomenal opponent that matched the intellect of Tony Stark and the power of Iron Man.Oh, but then an instance of exposition at the core of the film explodes disastrously as it turns out, The Mandarin is a fictional creation of the film's secondary villain, Aldrich Killian, played by Guy Pearce. What is devastating about this unforeseen, illogical and excitement crushing plot twist, is its unnecessary contribution to further complicating narrative matters. Not to discredit Pearce's performance, which is terrific, but Kingsley's interpretation of The Mandarin (before the revelation that he is just an actor, portraying The Mandarin for Killian: the 'real' Mandarin) is nothing short of exquisite; if that term can be used to apply to a perpetrator of terrorism. The marketers sold the film to us in a manner that presented The Mandarin as an antagonist to fear, but once Kingsley is quite abruptly replaced by Pearce in the foreground, the essence and prowess that the character had for the initial hour of the film, is lost amidst an superfluous twist that feels like a dreadful parody of The Incredibles (2004) and Batman Begins (2005).While the above mentioned revelation is something one wishes they could forget throughout the remaining portion of the film, unfortunately it stays with you like Kingsley's performance had the potential to stay with us had it been given the opportunity to flourish in its entirety. As if this is some sort of Iron Man tradition, the filmmakers somehow manage to strike out by producing three consecutive Iron Man films, which all share a similar demise of disappointing second halves, primarily due to the adaptation of the villains.Despite my disdain for an infuriatingly dissatisfying story, Iron Man 3 does indisputably offer an array of action-packed mayhem that is almost, but not quite, enough for you to forget your dislikes of the film. Shane Black additionally incorporates a wonderfully appropriate comedic element to the franchise that only further enhances our enjoyment from start to finish (exempting the middle). As a jolt for the much anticipated summer film period, Iron Man 3 certainly kick-starts the season with a feature with great replay value, primarily due to some, definitely not all, characters, action and comedy elements.Even with its abysmal twist, which I am unable to fully articulate my displeasure for, as well as an overall quite crowded narrative that becomes nauseating as it attempts to pack too much iron into our diets, Iron Man 3 is irrefutably entertaining. Unlikely to please the hardcore Iron Man fanatics, Shane Black's first endeavour into the character is more 'suit'ing for those that just want to be thrilled for 135 minutes. Not as a comic book reader, but as a cinemagoer I was disappointed in part by Iron Man 3's inexplicable indulgence into unnecessary narrative territory, though I would only be lying to myself to argue that I was not consistently enjoying myself throughout the (almost) entire Marvellous experience.Oh, and do stay for the post-credits scene.",7,1,2,21 May 2013
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Man prefers history to legends
","Many have conceived the combination of biographical drama with the very contemporary and perhaps oxymoronic fantasy genre as the pitfall in this picture. Ironically, this review will probably be an oxymoron to one above or below it terms of its disagreement with this opinion. This unique blend has great substance to feel as if the hybrid film is almost necessary to engage a modern audience to appreciate the life of the 16th US president, as if he could be more valued.Timur Bekmambetov's piece successfully delivers exactly what the title suggests. We recollect many details in the life of the one of the greatest US presidents, paralleling with the use of literal and allegorical vicious vampire figures to represent the 19th century confederacy. Lincoln's battle against this commences as a quest for retribution, only to evolve into something much bigger than himself; the retaining of core American values.I find this film to be a masterpiece in some respects. Most notably the editing by William Hoy, whose transitions provide us with quite sensational storytelling, further assisted with an adequate script and admirable performances from a highly respectable cast. Unfortunately however, the telling of the president's two pursuits, overlap as his fight for the abolishment of slavery begins. It appears less emphasised that feels necessary and is more so casually added to the narrative as salt is added to pasta, we know it should be there but head chef Bekmambetov has thrown it in without realising its significance. Nonetheless, the motion picture remains a great spectacle throughout, only until plot holes and moments of..well silliness begin to unfold towards the climax of the feature. Feeling the need to make a face of brief disappointment where I roll my head and say to myself 'really?' over the ridiculous and inconceivable mistakes made in production, I remain engaged to see how, what is foremost an enjoyable film, will conclude itself.As we conclude (both review and film), we return to the narration witnessed during the establishing shot, a technique that contains structure. 'History prefers legends to men'. While film history will not note this collaboration of genres as legendary, it does metaphorically tell a fictional interpretation of the life a legendary man.",7,2,4,10 July 2012
Argo," ArGo Look Yourself
","Being consumed by film marketing in the 21st century western world is almost an unavoidable right of passage for any owner of modern technology or in fact anyone who has ever been outdoors. As I do, and have, I was given great expectations for Argo that were not quite fulfilled to the capacity I had hoped.Despite my slight sense of disappointment, Argo is a splendid piece of work by director/producer/actor Ben Affleck. It is essentially a film about film, the latter not really being a film. Confused? Well you shouldn't be, the premise is rather straightforward and enlightens its younger audience (including myself) on the historical conflict between Iran and the United States of America in 1979. The non-fictional reality of the declassified event that occurred 32 years ago, while presumably slightly sensationalised for cinematic purposes, is rather inconceivable. While thoroughly engaged in the atmosphere the film creates, you continuously ask yourself if this genuinely happened. Knowing that it did is perplexing at a severe magnitude.In all honesty, Argo fails to really grasp the undivided attention of the audience until the final 30 minutes of the picture, though you appreciate the reservation of the best until last. It is as if you have been presented with a plate of food; knowing you must eat it all, you start on the vegetables to get them out of the way, then consume the adequate yet necessary side dish, before being enriched by the most prominent presence on the plate; it has the ability to satisfy the taste buds in every way possible, or cause a look of disgust and sickness dependant on its quality. Argo consists of the former of the two, as everything nearing the climactic resolution leaves you involuntarily paralysed in your seat as you await the next revelation or obstacle for the characters to endure. The tension that the feature generates results in gasps being heard around the theatre as the unpredictable nature of the characters' actions are unveiled.Whenever we relocate to scenes of lesser tension, we are more often than not gifted with tremendously suitable comic relief. Its situation in the narrative is not just present for entertainment purposes, it also facilitates in allowing us to feel as though we are experiencing the characters' endeavours. This is because the humour makes the best out of a bad situation for those that have been affected by the events at the start of the film. Everyone must keep their composure in order to get the job done, and the comedy is used to simply give the characters something to smile about and as a coping strategy, as when they feel this, it synchronises audience's emotions.The first 90 minutes of Argo is albeit very slow, though quite necessary to give us enough fuel to make it to the phenomenal conclusion. This also provides the biographic thriller with a pleasant structure, as no sequences are prolonged or too short and it builds itself up to behave like an amalgamation of necessary processes in order to achieve the goal the CIA have set out to do. The Oscar 'buzz' surrounding Argo are not feelings that I personally reciprocate due to the fact I did not feel absolutely immersed in the cinema screen throughout the showing, yet more so at specific moments, and also because it really does take some time for the picture to gain momentum, which is really the precautionary point the film conveys, but it just is not that engaging. This is one of those films whereby you are very glad you watched it; though do not feel that it requires you to sit through it another time.",7,0,0,30 November 2012
Star Trek Into Darkness," Benedict CumberBOSS
","Star Trek Into Darkness is a superior sequel in every way compared to its 2009 predecessor. J. J. Abrams' second effort in the franchise travels galaxies further in action, characters and overall storytelling which makes the sequel overall, indisputably an enjoyable experience.Cats would be all over my tongue if I attempted to approach Star Trek Into Darkness from the perspective of a Trek fan due to my unfamiliarity with the Star Trek universe that fans hold dear. Rather, this 2013 instalment is a much more approachable story than Star Trek (2009), and this mass appeal may discourage some loyal fans to the series, though I am unable to confirm such a claim. What I can say is that the film simply entertains and certainly makes Paramount's profuse marketing worth the effort. Even more so than the lavish yet appropriate CG effects, the character interactions emerge victorious in the quest for cinematic supremacy. The experience is only heightened by the trekmendous cast, particularly Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto andBenedict Cumberbatch (Yes, he is that good he deserves his own paragraph). The Sherlock actor absolutely dominates each and every second of screen time through voice, actions, persona and the intentions of his character John Harrison. He is so spectacularly, ostentatiously gracious is where he takes the character, and that destination will almost undoubtedly flourish over time, into one of the most memorable motion picture villains of the early 21st century. Each time his scenes conclude or the camera cuts away from him, inside you feel a little disappointed 'ohhh, ahhh' hoping for his return soon due to Cumberbatch's franchise-defining performance. If you fail to take much away from Star Trek Into Darkness, I can almost assure you that the iconic, villainous portrayal by Cumberbatch will be imprinted into your mind for a long time to come.While Cumberbatch's performance remains isolated from the film's other elements in its magnificence, the interdependent relationship between James. T Kirk (Chris Pine) and Spock (Zachary Quinto) prospers so greatly as their relationship develops, and feels more genuine than their previous collaboration four years ago. They share such a magical dialogue between one another, filled with wit, rhythm and even emotional chemistry, which is most explicitly examined during the unexpectedly heartfelt climax of the film. The writers (Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman and Damon Lindelof) warrant an enormous amount of credit for displaying how films that are primarily action based, can in fact posses scenes of characters verbally interacting with one another and still remain as strong blockbuster fun.Of course, Star Trek Into Darkness wouldn't achieve its blockbuster status by having its array of adored characters talking for two hours. No, the film requires an enormous amount of visual effects in order to achieve its title, and fortunately, the action is actually quite remarkably enjoyable. Dazzling images of majestic terror, colourful settings and of course explosions captivate your gaze for 132 minutes as they make you feel you are drifting through space for the first time, surrounded by unknown sights to behold. All the while, Star Trek Into Darkness manages to stay on course and not allow itself to divert into overlong and frustrating routes of action.The film is certainly not without its conveniences to presumably satisfy its audience; though ironically by doing this it dissatisfies the viewer as the level of predictability increases throughout and the story's resolution irritatingly pounces on an opportunity to conclude itself 'happily' and keep the narrative self-contained. This is primarily frustrating due to the manner in which the film could have ended: as an emotionally investing, sacrificial and unpredictable satisfying film. Instead, the plot's direction puts the clutch into reverse and ends up going back on itself due to its level of predictability as equilibrium is restored.If you are able to forgive the film's weaker elements and preserve judgement for the highly enjoyable experience that surrounds the characters and action, then Star Trek Into Darkness is likely to fulfil everything that it has promised. Even if in six months the four words Star, Trek, Into and Darkness fail to mean anything to you, be warned that the wrath of Cumberbatch's prevailing performance will likely remain prevalent amongst the mind's of us cinema-goers when considering who the greatest cinematic villains of recent history are.",7,4,7,15 June 2013
Ted," I didn't think my low expectations could have been disappointed. They were
","It almost feels necessary to reciprocate the vulgarity of this so called 'comedy' in order to express my distaste for its unoriginality, offensiveness, and ability to absorb incessant laughter from a mass audience, excluding myself. I will however restrain and refrain from reducing myself down to that level, in comedic terms, that level being beneath the basement of laughter.The fact Seth MacFarlane's directorial debut is categorised as a comedy is quite tragic. If 0ff-colour humour and flatulence are primary appeals for modern audiences, then we can unfortunately (or not if you enjoy it) prepare for a future comedy genre flooded with idiotic and stale humour. Every laugh in the theatre possessed a sense of shock, prior to genuine laughter because of the crude nature of the every ever predictable and tired joke, which were exhausted even before the opening credits.Take the attempted humour away from Ted and what are you left with? Other than a slightly more bearable two hours, the remains would be shorter than the amount of time it took me to want to leave the screening, which was not long at all. With all three of our main character's motives established early, their actions only become increasingly obvious, so obvious that one could probably predict the events if they were to have held a glass to the door of the screen with one ear at the other end and just listened rather than watched. They would have most likely had more fun than I too!While having a strong dislike for MacFarlane's three hugely popular animated series, I find my reasoning behind this similar to that of my loathing for Ted. These, in my opinion, pathetic excuses for the moving image, embark on what I can only describe, feels to me like being trapped on a one way train filled with loud, obnoxious passengers who are engaging in ignorant disputes, throwing useless insults at one another. The little steam it had prior to boarding is quickly diminished because of the engineer, MacFarlane's lack of skill to sustain a working locomotive.Despite the above, perhaps harsh criticisms, there were few positive elements to the worst film I have seen this year, maybe any year. The combination of live action and animation looks superb, to a point where you do not even question the reality of the character Ted's existence. It would have complemented the film more had we seen more emotion displayed by the character in terms of facial expression and body language, as it is solely dialogue which makes him feel like any more than a child's teddy bear. Overall though, the Tippet Studio visual effects team did a terrific job. Back to reality, or well, a real person in Mila Kunis playing a fictional character. The most convincing of all characters due to the genuine emotion she appears to convey.The only way in which the eyes that are looking over the hands typing this review would once again witness the film that is Ted, would be if Universal Studios decided to pay me. Those who are fans of MacFarlane's work on Family Guy and subsequent almost identical series will be prone to enjoying another very similar tale of pointless storytelling. I personally would not recommend this immaturity to anyone who does not appreciate the director's other works.",1,5,10,8 August 2012
Life of Pi," Life of Pi, mi oh mi
","Ang Lee's aesthetic masterpiece has one extraordinary ability: Life of Pi is a film of beautifully sustained momentum throughout. We are so gracefully paced through the narrative and immersed into the theatrical experience, despite the fact the events endured are not necessarily progressive. This is one of the few releases whereby the 3D is actually engaging, not distracting and aids in the artistic integrity of the picture.This is storytelling! The majority of Life of Pi is presented in flashback form, often returning to the present to have our protagonist show his emotional reaction to the story of his own life. This works. The structural operation in effect in the film is fascinating. We ask questions; why does this one man's story matter? Did these events really happen to the character? What is the meaning of the story? To be brief, the climactic revelation that comfortably explains and answers our queries is so phenomenally crafted and logical that it renovates what was throughout, a seemingly good film, into one of 2012s most fantastic features.Life of Pi is such a fragile picture that it almost is entitled to avoid negative criticism. Lee's piece is so wonderfully constructed that to say changes should be made is unquestionably difficult as, as the films stands, it is near flawless. Nonetheless, I believe that few additional scenes would benefit the narrative in various ways. I had no emotional investment with the film, which I was constantly hoping for. This is not negative sentiment, more so a hopeful one. Regardless of its existing greatness, Life of Pi could have been greater. Had more character interaction taken place on the ship, we, or just I, would have felt a vast amount of relation to our protagonist Pi, and his story would have felt like my story, yet there was a particular distance between audience and character. This resulted in connecting with the character known as The Writer, whom the story is being told to by Pi, rather than Pi himself. This is something I wanted from the film, rather than disliked.Life of Pi is a spiritual, visual and telling tale, that absorbs us into a magical journey that feels as if the screen resolution is wrapping around the theatre, giving us the feel of no escape, not that we would want to interrupt this 127 minute majesty. This is the only way I relate to Pi, for he has only himself and Bengal tiger Richard Parker for company, while I felt as if it was just me and the screen in the room. Even the ignorantly talkative cinema-goers behind me failed to disrupt this truly beautiful cinematic experience for me. Ang Lee leaps beyond the satisfactory, beyond the splendid, reaching the extraordinary, that did have the potential to be even more so, though still remains a great stature as this year's film count concludes.",8,2,5,27 December 2012
Pacific Rim," Terrific Rim...at Times.
","'We always thought alien life would come from the stars, but it came from deep beneath the sea'. In fact, director Guillermo del Toro brought new life to the monster movie genre with the epic and undeniably entertaining Pacific Rim right here on land.Pacific Rim delivers just about what one might expect from seeing its trailers or even just hearing about it. Guillermo del Toro's vision is complex in its ambition and scale, but simple enough in its high-concept premise. When the Pacific Ocean receives an unwelcome portal between dimensions, alien life invites itself into our world and certainly doesn't wish to remain unnoticed as mass destruction of Earth's infrastructure ensues. In response, the Jaeger Project is born, creating monsters of our own to combat the deadly, in a sense, subterranean species. Del Toro immediately invites us into his multidimensional universe, with the cinema screen acting as the portal where for 131 minutes you are transported on a journey of majestic imagery.The initial 30 minutes in this new universe, (a universe which is only further enhanced by the third dimension and IMAX experience) is unfortunately spent telling us what we probably already know. There are certain films where you wish you had known less going in as surprises are spoiled by your anticipation and natural assumptions. Pacific Rim differs in no way and in fact could have benefited from more constructive and ambiguous pre-released material as its opening half- hour is more or less an extended version of the trailers. As with most stories however, judgment should really be reserved until its middle and end have executed their purpose.Pacific Rim is effortlessly enjoyable, tie-in toyable, with monsters and robots readily deployable into battle sequences so convincing and grand, that you look up to the screen as you would these monsters in real life and this makes Del Toro rightly employable.While the action has you synchronised unbreakably with Del Toro's vision due to the prowess of the CGI, which just feels like I alone, you cannot help but wish for the camera to take a giant step backwards. Although obviously done intentionally, Del Toro leaves the camera awkwardly in between the action at times, and the result is perplexing. With films such as Jaws (1975) and Cloverfield (2008), the devastating creatures are purposefully obscure visually and shown infrequently to heighten the sense of danger and fear of the unknown. Meanwhile, with Jurassic Park (1993) and other similar creature features, we are monstrously engaged and aesthetically informed by being able to see the action and nonhuman characters clearly afar when necessary. Pacific Rim is uncomfortably framed in between this spectrum at times and this unfortunately lessens the visual value and experience of the film overall.While the battle sequences are the most anticipated, decorated and appropriately stated highlights of Pacific Rim, they are only setpieces to the much bigger war. The primary point of interest away and even importantly within the action is the film's central theme of unification. Seeing the abandonment of international conflicts, petty feuds and meaningless separation between Earth's people holds a great deal of truth to it when faced with a common enemy. Del Toro maintains this theme consistently throughout the feature, with the giant Jaeger robots even requiring a coalition between two pilots emotionally and cerebrally to function capably.While puny individual Earthlings are thrown in for purposes of making the film grounded and recognisable, it's really the robots and aliens you came to see. Nonetheless, Idris Elba and the brief yet excellent performance of child actress Mana Ashida stand out chiefly even when facing the immeasurable monsters at their doors.Pacific Rim is quite literally a groundbreaking feat in cinematic excellence because Guillermo del Toro immerses his audience into his world, his galaxy, his universe with relative ease, and the goal to please, which he achieves. While it has its flaws and calculates its fair share of question marks for itself, Pacific Rim is difficult to deny as anything but entertainment. It's simple, it's smashing, its scale is felt with incredible zealous. It's Pacific Rim.",7,0,4,5 August 2013
Rush," Catch It While You Can
","Biographical sports drama Rush tracks the strictly competitive rivalry between Formula One racers James Hunt and Niki Lauda during the 1970s.Even before you've arrived at the starting line, there may be understandable scepticism on whether Rush is really a race you wish to run with. However, like Moneyball (2011) before it, I was pleasantly surprised at how investing a story about a sport I know nothing about and care nothing for could be. Cars are useless without people to drive them. Rush is a vehicle painted with a core theme of the professional and personal consequences of fierce rivalry, between it two primary passengers. Formula One racing is just the fuel to push the vehicle to its eventual destination.It is a story worth telling, both for those who were spectating during the 1970s, and for those like myself who are still taking driving lessons and didn't know the names Niki Lauda or James Hunt until this film existed. Behind Ron Howard's careful direction and sensitivity to the story, Rush invites its audience to witness the depth of competitiveness that Lauda and Hunt travelled through. Its expertly crafted pace, detail and tone complement the (f)actual events also, with Niki Lauda even expressing his positive reaction to the film's look and accuracy.Despite a 123 minute run, your legs feel motionless. Rush is a timeless tale in two senses: 1. Its great display of the triumphs and pitfalls that competitiveness can have are accessible and applicable throughout history, throughout the modern world, and probably will be throughout the future 2. The film is so engrossing that not once did I question how much time had passed nor how close we were to the end. Rush has enough continuous momentum to take us to the end of the journey without exhausting emissions, as we cruise through seamlessly to the finish lineWith its fantastic editing and storytelling techniques to push the story along without making it feel, dare I say...Rushed, Rush masterfully places its two protagonists in lanes so far apart that only their egos are able to fill the empty space. Like Batman and The Joker, Hunt and Lauda are represented as polar opposites whom were almost destined to become competitors, as it is only their mutual rivalry that fuels their motivation to win. Without one competing with such passion, the other wouldn't have the passion to compete at all.The story is only complemented further by the enthralling performances of Daniel Brühl (Lauda) and Chris Hemsworth (Hunt), in addition to Olivia Wilde's brief yet brilliant supporting role. Rush's arrival at the finish line is as smooth as the ride that Ron Howard takes us along throughout. Thrilling, investing, interesting and well-made flawlessness, is about all one could request of a biopic that centres around such sensitive source-material. Rush is exciting, frightening but most of all the right thing to catch up to in theatres as its release seems to be on its final laps around UK tracks, so rush to see it. Oh dear I wrote it again.",8,2,3,2 November 2013
Oblivion," Oblivion Indeed
","oblivion (uh-bliv-ee-uh n) noun. 1. the condition or quality of being completely forgotten 2. the state of forgetting or of being obliviousThe only accolade that Oblivion may collect during its short tenure in the memory of cinema-going civilisation (other than a Razzie award) will be the honour for ironically living up to its title with sincere loyalty, even though I doubt that was the producers' intention. This truly is a forgettable film that is completely oblivious of where is wanted to go or what it wanted to be.Oblivion begins with a straightforward and vaguely interesting premise that does not necessarily offer anything new to the sci-fi genre but remains aesthetically magnificent enough for your engagement to remain trustworthy and hopeful that you will be entertained for the next two hours. However, the novelty of the excellent visual effects begins to subside as you come to the realisation that you hold no investment or inkling of care for the characters or narrative. All of one's dislikes of the film suddenly overtake any adoration that you could have had. It is a race between which feature of the film is most generic and reminiscent of other films. It really is difficult to determine a winner of this contest of conventions as there are so many racers clambering over one another, leaving the disappointed spectators unimpressed with the messy display.Oblivion manages not only to make its own theatrical experience less interesting with a weak plot, unconvincing acting and predictable twists, but it in fact reminds us of other cinematic indulgences that we have experienced in the past. Oblivion completely removes its audience from its futuristic setting and contradictorily displaces us back into 2012, 2009, 1999 and probably many other years that I am unaware of. It replicates elements of The Dark Knight Rises (through its score) as well as Total Recall, Moon and The Matrix via the plot. When you spend a large quantity of a film thinking about past films that are superior because the film you are watching tries to overtly be an amalgamated duplicate of these films, it certainly expresses the failure of that film as its presumed intentions to keep you engrossed have failed. If you thought the sentence before this one was quite a mouthful of literary mess, then just imagine that very sentence being adapted for a film and Oblivion is what you will conceive. Essentially, the objective for most feature films in my opinion will be to engage its audience to a state of complete escapism, but when watching Oblivion, one's mind manages to escape this escapism as you spend more time concerned with other films that Oblivion is trying to be, rather than Oblivion itself.The only unpredictable aspect of Oblivion is that the film concludes without a purpose. You are anticipating a dull and conventional climax that will leave you dissatisfied, but in fact something worse lurks at the finale of this unspectacular picture. Once the credits begin to scroll in and out of our vision, the usual cinematic reflection commences and your opinion of the film as a whole begins to emerge, and the only question I have for Oblivion is: What was the point? None of the events mattered, unexplained events are left scattered, and what for the first 20 minutes appeared to be a decent film, shattered into an abyss of dreadful storytelling.I do not wish be completely negative about Oblivion. To give the film credit, there were perhaps a few elements that made the film okay. Most notably the special effects truly are outstanding to the point that they completely convince you of their reality. The futuristic technology, while at times inconsistent, generally is the only feature that keeps you engaged, as to be fair to the film, there is not a moment of boredom to be had during Oblivion, though the levels of excitement negatively correlate with the 126 minute length of the film. Another component of the film that is good would be Tom Cruise's character Jack's attempts at preserving all that he holds dear about humanity as it once was. He desires to restore culture, customs and ideals that he knows existed before the fictional war that occurs before we enter the chronology of the film. Unfortunately though, they fail to enforce this philosophy enough for us to care about his character. Had this been made clear as the focal point in the film, our devotion and concern for the character may have been higher.Indeed Oblivion is a watchable film, though is just not all that enjoyable and there are honestly too many things to dislike about the film that weighing your likes and dislikes of the film is identically imbalanced with a lot of the film's scenes. Some scenes that are fairly unimportant are given a higher degree of emphasis than those that are actually concerned with the narrative, and often feel rushed just so they can get to the action sequences that follow. I am sure some will enjoy Oblivion, but I do not recommend anyone to waste their time with this film as you do not gain anything from being a spectator other than gaining insight that this is how not to tell a story.",3,41,84,11 April 2013
Man of Steel," Men of Steel
","Where to begin? Well this origin story begins as a Superbly Magnificent retelling of one of the most recognisable fictional figures on the planet today. Man of Steel remains consistently loyal to its title, showcasing Clark Kent's perceived misplacement into a world unknown to his abilities, introducing Kal-El as the lost part of this misunderstood Man, who finally Steels the show once a threat to Earth results in his acceptance of his freedom to do right, and become the shining beacon of hope for mankind: Superman.With Henry Cavill as our nearest, powerful star, and a near unfathomably remarkably talented and irreplaceable cast to play the supporting characters orbiting him constantly, Man of Steel is nothing but awesome to watch from just an acting and characterisation aspect alone. Director Zach Snyder, Writer David S. Goyer and Producer Christopher Nolan, along with the perfect casting of Cavill, all manage to converge the three parts of the protagonist's identity (Clark Kent, Kal-El and Superman) with such delicacy and flawless excellence that makes the titular character, the Man of Steel himself, the highlight in this comic book film. Narrative, visual effects, music and everything else aside, Man of Steel is carried through galaxies because of its tremendously executed character study that cements itself firmly into the realms of other great superhero films including Spider-Man (2002) and Batman Begins (2005). Of course, the existence of a star is meaningless if the satellites orbiting it are not naturally flourishing with life, but oh Man do the supporting characters make gazing upon on screen stars a privilege to be a cinemagoer. Russell Crowe, Kevin Costner, Diane Lane, Antje Traue and Michael Shannon among others, certainly collaborate as their own glowing constellation, and you cannot help but gape in enjoyment, and in doing so you might attain heat vision with how intensely enchanting the actors are.Structurally, Man of Steel adopts a fairly unique craft in presenting Clark Kent's craving for a legitimate identity, with flashbacks to expose the routes of his anguish set upon him by his paternal father Jonathon Kent (Costner). These scenes are surprisingly amongst the greatest that the film offers, with Superb character development and emotional depth that has yet to be reached by any other comic book adaptation other than Sam Raimi's Spider-Man. As someone not at all fond of the Superman character before seeing Man of Steel, I was captivated by Snyder's and the cast's ability to provoke such emotion from what I thought would only be an action film, though I could not have been more incorrect, as it is so much more.The main narrative is by no means unique. Primary villain General Zod of the Kryptonian race, attempts to carry out plans we have seen a number of times before, but his motivation behind this is extremely convincingly elaborated and explored through Shannon's portrayal. Though at times slightly overshadowed by his sidekick Faora (Antje Traue), Shannon is worthy of the title General as it is in his DNA to be so. This is what sets him apart from Cavill's iconic character. Superman's DNA enables the freedom to decide what is right and wrong, but is primarily nurtured by the presence of biological father Jor-El (Crowe) and both Kent parents.There are honestly too many features to applaud throughout Man of Steel. The film is undoubtedly a masterful work of filmmaking in its aesthetically astounding set-pieces, which while very much overloaded into Man of Steel, are still appropriately contained by the visual prowess of Zach Snyder and the special effects team. Additionally, Hans Zimmer yet again delivers his trademark composition; that trademark being majestic excellence that is simply a pleasure to listen to, with or without the Super images to accompany it on screen. There is almost no escaping the beautiful visuals and sounds that make up this 144 minute feature, not that you would want to miss a second. Watching Man of Steel, you feel like Superman taking his first flight, taking in the incredible sights with an enormous grin of delight in spite of the fright that the experience might not have reached the height of your expectations. Well right from lift off, Man of Steel is a truly thrilling and enjoyable cinematic experience, frame by frame, scene by scene, act to act, Man of Steel is immensely wonderful until you feet get back on the ground and the last credit scrolls out of you vision.Even though towards the film's conclusion, the title Men of Steel feels more appropriate as seemingly unwanted characters begin to overshadow General Zod and the Man of the hour (well two hours, twenty-four minutes), indeed, Superman Returns (pun intended) and the on screen revival of the character comes to a most satisfactory end. This is a thankful return, as without the core character to standout amongst the features that orbit him, Man of Steel would not have been the phenomenal film that it is. You could pause Man of Steel at almost any moment and witness sensational cinematography. You could close your eyes and just listen to genius Hans Zimmer composition. You could even just walk into the theatre midway through the screening and avoid the character development, and appreciate the jaw-dropping action sequences. Doing any of these would result in substantial enjoyment I can almost assure, but you would also most likely miss out on the Man, who is actually quite Super even without the cape.",9,1,7,6 July 2013
Silver Linings Playbook," Leave the cinema with a smile for a change?
","Hectic rather than dramatic; charming rather than funny; and as for romance, that would be somewhat of an insult on behalf of one of this year's finer films. Silver Linings Playbook leads rather than follows an off-beat style for its genre. Scratch that, you gather the sense that it advocates its own genre due to its uniquely complex characters and relationships, yet with a simplistic and easy to follow narrative.The most perplexing scenario when engaged in the theatrical experience is how much we, the audience, are energised by these rather peculiar characters. Each conveys some form of dysfunctional behaviour, whether it is some mental incapacity, an obsession or lying to one's self. Nevertheless, they are extraneously relatable which formulates a wonderful character-audience relationship simultaneously. One can imagine the ease in which the independent studio could have sensationalised the relationships, or added the dreaded cheese factor to this delightful November release. As it turns out, we were instead gifted with this grounded, rounded earth of a film, by which I mean complete as a whole in its entirety. Once the final shot transits to the rolling credits, we feel we require no more from the two hours of pleasurable endurance, whilst also being unable to identify a single flaw, which proves evident in the countless smiling faces (including your own) around the theatre and uplifted mood around the room. The primary cause for this 'Silver Lining Theory' (Bharat Samra trademark) is undoubtedly the combination of an evidently well-written script and truly tremendous acting. The amalgamation of seemingly authentic and convincing dialogue blended with the two phenomenal lead actors and numerous noteworthy supporting actors is what fuels the picture into a smooth journey up a straight path, with some bumps along the way to enable our protagonist to maintain and test his fortitude.One of the aspects of the film which as a viewer you hugely appreciate is lack of condescension. You learn so much about each individual character that there is no need to be continuously reminded of what is occurring in the narrative, as you become so immersed into their lives and behaviours, you almost instantly adopt their personalities, meaning we can assume their actions, and the motion picture's integrity does not yield, yet increases with confluent storytelling. Each actor involved with this production warrants copious acclaim as their influential authority over their roles are not for a second doubted, as they own their part so reliably well. Most conspicuously, the leads in Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper are foremost worth valuing due to their, excuse the following cliché, on screen chemistry. Robert De Niro and Chris Tucker are also sensationally suited for this film, for their opposing roles. Tucker not surprisingly assists in the comedic department comfortably, while De Niro vents an irrational, confused and a times angry father to Cooper's character Pat due to his OCD.I believe this to be one of the rare contemporary cinematic releases that compels throughout. It has heart, humour, hedonism and happiness, though you may as times witness the interfamily conflict, the restoration of happiness is, inevitable. The fact that not a lot actually happens in this independent film can be disregarded because it is the characters and their dialogue which carries the picture perhaps into further future award winning territory, to add to the already achieved accolades. Silver Linings Playbook is suitable for almost any demographic, assuming you are indeed above the age of consent for this particular picture, I can almost guarantee enjoyment and pleasure for at least the two hour duration, and even long after the screening, especially the climactic, quite simply fun dance sequence, along with even learning the implication of the terrific title.",8,5,15,22 November 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," Enjoyable nostalgia
","It proves problematic analysing this film without comparing it and Sam Raimi's 2002 approach to the same character. These similarities and differences are both detrimental and admirable to Marc Webb's picture.As one of 2012's most anticipated films, 'The Amazing Spider-Man' suffers greatly from it consciousness. Excuse the pun, but the tone during the 136 minutes a certain 'Spidey-sense' about itself; knowledgeable of its existence as a reboot, and not a new trilogy. The unfortunate consequences of this are within the nostalgic narrative, which we all remember from a decade ago. Not only does this film follow the original story, but it's aware of it, causing the evolution of Spider-Man to be rushed as if the director is saying, 'you've seen it before, let's just swing through this part of the story'. There is more to see from this series, reportedly, at least a trilogy, though the first of three could have been condensed into the opening title sequence, as the formulaic story has already been tested once before in cinema by Raimi. Nevertheless, the love story between Peter Parker and Gwen Stacey presents itself as more convincing than what we saw from Raimi's films with Mary-Jane Watson. Our female love interest (portrayed by Emma Stone) actually provides the plot with some importance, and does not need to be saved by our hero in the climax as her predecessor (Kirsten Dunst) repeatedly did in all three of Raimi's pictures. In its entirety, the film feels as if it is an introduction to a story, the blurb of your favourite novel, forgotten, because you enjoyed what followed so much more.The angle taken by Webb and the cast can be applauded. The choreography, characterisation and dialogue have successfully adapted to the approach of having Peter Parker becoming Spider-Man whilst still in high school. Andrew Garfield portrays the character as arrogant, rebellious and at time reckless, in both personality and acrobatic style (give credit to his stunt doubles also), hugely contrasting from what we saw from Tobey Maguire. Both actors provide various memorable qualities to the comic book hero, contrastingly so, meaning preference between the two is no clear choice, simply down to opinion. There are a number of factors to consider when selecting a winner. On one hand, 'The Amazing Spider-Man' explores the origin story of the character which is yet to be completely revealed, leaving the anticipation for fans for future sequels. Furthermore, we encounter a far superior romance story between Gwen Stacey and Peter Parker so in terms to Spider-Man's humanity, Garfield's interpretation wins out. However, Maguire simply fits the costume better, and makes for a better Spider-Man. We can contribute much this to his voice and the CGI of the character used by studio. Furthermore, the actually story of Spider-Man just does not feel very heroic this time around. The suit itself though with a warm home- made approach to it, bluntly worded does not look as good as in Raimi's series. Though we shouldn't necessarily judge a hero by his mask right? Well depending on what the mask represents. Any suit, whether it is Captain America's, Batman's or Spider-Man's should be a symbol for what these characters believe in, yet this film explores the use of the suit in a continuous quest for vengeance by the character, consequently signifying less of an American hero as we saw from Raimi. Webbing together what exactly this means; Garfield wins the Peter Parker award, while Maguire wins the Spider-Man trophy, resulting in my personal favouritism leaning towards Maguire.'Who am I?' The primary theme of identity is highly emphasised by Webb, as the character attempts to deal with a variety of relatable human and superhero problems. He never really does find himself within the film, yet indicates a certain growth in character because of the adversity he faces, often from his own hubris, making him a tragic hero who is required to fathom that ''with great power, comes great responsibility'.There are certainly aspects of this film that are an evident improvement from what Raimi did. Conversely, many components that I adored in the previous series are severely missed, making it intricate to establish a definite preference between the two. The music in this reboot is a satisfactory bungalow when up against the Empire State that was the score by Danny Elfman in the first two Spider-Man films, and Christopher Young in the third. No disrespect to James Horner whose contribution to 'The Amazing Spider-Man's' score is excellent, but with the will to compare, it's like a butter knife to a gun fight. I do not wish to bore those reading, as endless comparisons between the two and analysis of the stand alone film could provoke me to write a dissertation of needless proportions. Therefore, I will conclude by stating my comprehension of this review's bias, due to my obsession with the comic book hero, I almost refrained from observing its many imperfections. However, after watching it three times already I felt I have identified 'The Amazing Spider-Man' as a motion picture that had great potential to reboot an already successful film franchise. Was it necessary for Webb to reboot? Yes! I feel that he has introduced a new story for Peter Parker/Spider-Man that was not considered by Raimi. The execution may not have been perfect, yet this instalment does provide a great sense of well performed humour, action and emotion that perhaps is only existent due to the 50 year anniversary of Stan Lee's and Marvel's most successful character. This highly enjoyable reboot will hopefully instigate a more original story is subsequent sequels. 6/10 is perhaps too critical of Webb's work, yet the almost identical narrative to 2002 is this film's biggest downfall, as our villain in Dr. Curtis Connors/The Lizard acquires indistinguishable motives to that of Norman Osborn as the Green Goblin. It is Marvelous nonetheless, to see that the adored character Spider-Man has yet to spin his last Webb in cinema.",7,2,7,9 July 2012
Now You See Me," Come In Close. Because the More You Think You See, the Easier It'll Be To Disappoint You...
","'Come in close. Because the more you think you see, the easier it'll be to fool you...' Not only do the distributors of Now You See Me use this piece of gripping dialogue as the tagline for the film, but exhibitors will also utilise it to trick international audiences into delving into their pockets and wasting their time with this enormously disappointing and unexciting caper film. Now You See Me follows the story of four magicians, known as The Four Horsemen, as they captivate the world with 'magical', near inexplicable bank heists before rewarding their audiences and supporters with the money they take. The only trickery happening here is being hypnotised by the highly intriguing trailer, only to find you yourself have been robbed as you sit in disbelief that you paid to see a film that is about as unique and intricate as a card game of snap!Despite the sensational ensemble of Jesse Eisenberg, Mark Ruffalo, Woody Harrelson, Mélanie Laurent, Isla Fisher, Dave Franco, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman, they fail to assemble accordingly. They all deliver satisfactory performances but are not given the opportunity to flourish as we may have seen them do so in past roles. This is primarily due to the fact that director Louis Leterrier, along with the writers, attempt to pull too many rabbits out of the hat at one time and so rather than enjoy one bunny at a time, we instead see a ton of terrific actors be undervalued and restricted in showcasing their talents. Most oddly, The Four Horsemen (Eisenberg, Fischer, Harrelson and Franco) are even given surprisingly little screen time after their thirty minute introduction as the film begins.In all fairness, Now You See Me does remain consistent. Consistently unintriguing that is. The film's aforementioned tagline, along with unsubtle hints scattered dubiously throughout regarding the illusionary concept of misdirection, completely ruin any surprise and twist that the 'suspense' film has to offer. By doing this the film leaves little to be unveiled during the climax, one would think, though time is actually wasted explaining all of the plot points you already guessed, while conjuring up new components to the story that remain unresolved and/or illogically explained to the extent that even in a film about magic/illusions, you fail to believe any of the tricks being performed. The illusion of cinema fails as much as the illusion of magic fails to prevail in Now You See Me.Now You See Me is comparable to the student who believes they are the cool fresher on campus, the funniest, with a unique personality, and a mistaken sense of self-intelligence that causes them to continue to contribute to seminars despite the fact they never answer anything correctly. No, in fact, Now You See Me needs to be told by its peers (let's say that's us) that it is not nearly as intellectually gifted, cool, witty or exceptional as it pretends to be. You most certainly will not miss out on anything if you chose not to befriend this dull, generic and embarrassingly misleading film, that is posing as an intricate and sophisticated figure on the surface.When the first thought on my mind after exiting my cinema seat after Now You See Me was 'I actually wish the film had been sold out so I could have returned home to watch The Prestige (2006) or see Man of Steel (2013) again', it pretty much encapsulates my attitude towards the disappointing Leterrier film. While there is nothing necessarily evident to hate in Now You See Me, there is not a single component to commend as great either. Now You See Me is truly a forgettable 115 minute time thief, and though I have Seen it Now, I would have preferred instead to have missed it and been kept under the illusion that it was in fact an intricate tale, rather than a misdirected fail.",3,179,349,5 July 2013
Wreck-It Ralph," Pushes all the right buttons...mostly
","The term 'Disney magic' has become somewhat of a cliché in the realms of 21st century animation. Nonetheless, it cannot be more so appropriately applied than in the consumption of these two delightful Disney animations on your trip to the nearest cinema. If you are confused by my pluralisation of animation, then I will elaborate by saying that the acclaimed studio treats their audience, old and young, with a heart- warming animated short titled Paperman prior to the 92 minute pleasure that you purchased the tickets for. The 7 minute short serves as the appetiser to the enchanting experience that we so commonly associate with the studio's family films, and there is plenty of room left for us to enjoy the great taste of magic at the conclusion of Wreck-It Ralph.While Wreck-It Ralph pushes many of the formulaic storytelling buttons, you simply do not care. The level of enjoyment is too high to be concerned with attempting to criticise the film for its venture into familiar territory. It still contains a great deal of individuality and originality, primarily through its homage to retro and contemporary video games that many of us know and love. It is recycled material that is so clean and unique that it works as well, if not better than, any original. Put simply, you have fun watching Wreck-It Ralph and I believe no matter the age of the viewer, something will appeal to you in this film. The humour is seemingly directed towards the youngest of demographics for this feature, and I will admit my own slight disappointment at the fact I laughed very few times, a lot less than I was hoping for. However, what the animation may lack in humour, it certainly makes up for in other regions. Many, including myself, will appreciate the nostalgic throwback to video games of the recent and not so recent past. Furthermore, the story of Wreck-It Ralph is exceptionally, and even slightly surprisingly sensational! Each and every element of the plot fits together so incredibly well, that screenwriters Phil Johnston and Jennifer Lee have clearly demonstrated their phenomenal talent to make everything in their story relevant, balanced and unanimously appealing. Similarly with previous Disney animations, they manage to take something from many of our everyday lives, and adapt it by creating and exploring a new world of unequivocal genius. One of the most admirable aspects to Wreck-It Ralph is the way in which different gaming worlds interact with one another, whilst staying loyal to their own arcade home. For instance, those in the title character's game possess robotic manoeuvres, while other games appear as actual modern video game gameplay, and as a gamer, I can vouch that these individual attributes are most definitely appreciated and entertaining to experience. Even the product placement (which I am not generally fond of in film, though understand its use) is so appropriately implemented that even a sceptic can appreciate its presence. If Disney were to instigate a consumer guarantee that stated any audience member may have their money back if they failed to in some way, shape or form, be entertained by Wreck-It Ralph, I can almost assure that the volume of tickets returned to theatre desks would fewer than the amount of times my eyes diverted their attention away from the screen the film was presented on (do note that I did not look away once). Despite quite useless use of 3D (as in 99% of films), the colourful and developing animated aesthetic absorbs your mind throughout, and you leave with the desire to play a video game, or watch the film again; either is likely to entertain. There are only brief nitpicks to mention in relation to Wreck-It Ralph, as for the overwhelming majority of the film, you have a great amount of fun. The protagonist's relationship with the main supporting character is one that is inevitable and frankly cute to see occur. Yet the transition from their annoyance to adoration for one another could have been developed further, to make it more convincing. In addition, the humour is an unfortunate element due to its elementary reservation, though I am just being too critical and will stop typing because overall Wreck-It Ralph is a fantastically pleasurable animated film.",8,1,1,24 February 2013
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Truly an unexpected journey!
","It is not very often that a film's title encapsulates all it stands for. We truly are taken on an unexpected journey of wonder, and the most sensational fantasy ride the world of cinema has to offer. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is one of the few films this year, that just continues to get better as we embark on this phenomenal adventure.After the first hour, we begin to suspect that the thrills we have just been witness to will come to an inevitable end, and the integrity of the film will exacerbate and become exhausted with time. Well that is what I anticipated anyway, and I could not have been more incorrect. Peter Jackson finds a exceptional balance between accommodating to The Lord of the Rings fans (which I admit I am not) and creating a new, fresh film franchise that will be just as memorable as the trilogy of the 2000s. There is a predictable nature of comparing The Hobbit to The Lord of the Rings, and I won't try to do any differently as there are natural parallels and differences to be observed. First and foremost, the story is vaguely similar to The Fellowship of the Ring, in that a peaceful and I guess, underdog of a hobbit, is given the task of a greatly important quest that requires determination, loyalty and cooperation. Differently to the trilogy however, The Hobbit does not emphasise its key themes until we are close to the end of the ride and the brakes are seemingly being put down. Nonetheless, when the motifs of loyalty, pride and patriotism are revealed, there is no surprise or disappointment as they have been present all along, just not prevalently expressed as camaraderie is in The Fellowship of the Ring.In all honesty, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is simply fun. You have fun when you are watching. Scratch that. When you are living it. You don't feel like a human sitting in a theatre watching a film, you feel so completely engaged in the story, the characters, and the world of Middle-Earth. I almost felt that after leaving the cinema, I just been brainwashed for 170 minutes because I was just taken into a land of utter amusement and inconceivable enjoyment, not just surpassing my expectations for the film, but making those very expectations feel ashamed they ever doubted the opening of the trilogy for a moment.I feel no need to proclaim everything the film did right and fantastically because the list would be endless. It probably would be more appropriate to discuss my dislikes of which there are only two, but to discredit The Hobbit in written form in any way possible would be to seemingly decline my enthusiasm for the next two years of the franchise, so 'I shall not pass' negative judgement. I was quite happily ready to regard The Dark Knight Rises as 2012s finest offeringof film (that I have seen), even in July. Now I am afraid that Christopher Nolan's incredible conclusion to a trilogy, has been replaced by this almost perfect opening to another, what I hope will end up as, magical in every sense of the word, trilogy, of its own. That may be the unexpectedness of my enjoyment of The Hobbit, and slight disappointment at the conclusion to Nolan's Batman talking, but nevertheless, I stand in saying that Peter Jackson has delivered the standout film of the year... so far of course, there are seven days left.",9,7,16,24 December 2012
Behind The Candelabra," Not a Negative Claim to Make
","Being forcefully persuaded into seeing a film when you have no interest or knowledge of it is one thing; but to then be pleasantly surprised at your own delight and enjoyment of that very same film is certainly another. Behind the Candelabra follows the contextually tragic moments in the life of the musical entertainer Liberace, and unfortunately is likely to remain somewhat of a hidden treasure due to its limited release. The cinephiles that are fortunate enough to discover it beneath the grains of less humorous, less glamorous and less genuine cinematic offerings (which all still garner abundantly more popularity) will hopefully have discovered a truly refreshing gem of a drama film.Behind the Candelabra is a HBO Films production that has been reserved to a US television release as well as a limited European exhibition, due to its thematic content being 'too gay' as director Steven Soderbergh articulated. This devastating justification from the Hollywood studios for not picking up the film is as tragic as Liberace's own fear for the economic impact and public reputation that he believed he would see diminish if his personal life were to be known. Sadly, as the majority of fans probably never knew of Liberace's true personality, today's majority will not have the pleasure of witnessing this pure and remarkably emotional biographical film.Despite the film itself being projected on screen, Soderbergh's true intentions are for the emotion of the film to be directed and projected onto us: the audience. Behind the Candelabra is truly enjoyed and experienced as a collective group with every other cinemagoer in the room, though you yourself will forget there is another soul in the theatre due to the emotionally investing 118 minute feature in front of your eyes that takes you away from your own reality and places you in an interpretation of Liberace's. Michael Douglas' magical performance as the once internationally renowned entertainer captivates your consciousness with his electric charm, fabulously worn costumes and overall tremendous acting ability. Douglas' performance however only constitutes 50% of the relationship that the film revolves around, and is irrelevant without Matt Damon's pivotal and magnificent portrayal of Liberace's other half, Scott Thornson. The relationship they share, IS the film. Without the two talents to confidently and charismatically carry Thornson and Liberace into the 21st century, the film would certainly fall apart and lack the sense of purity that the two actors manage to organically create as they collaborate. It is a great sadness to see the relationship stumble over avoidable hurdles, and conversely a thing of beauty to see the non- fictional characters high jump over obstacles to sustain their romance. Other features of the film greatly supplement the focal relationship and characters to a quite notable degree. While Douglas and Damon certainly carry the film, Soderbergh piles other cinematic elements atop of the actors' hands which make for a visually and audibly delightful experience. The costumes, sets, locations and most emphatically the soundtrack are powerfully incorporated to give Soderbergh's film an enjoyable charm, and while only supplementary to the core relationship, they are distinctly memorable due to their grandeur through both sight and sound.The only thing lacking in Behind the Candelabra is that there is nothing negative to criticise about the film. This is a rare feature of any motion picture, and it is the result of great filmmaking. Behind the Candelabra is consistently purposeful from one scene to the next. It is subtly humorous when appropriate, tragically emotional on cue and ultimately continuously engaging throughout. While it may not receive the attention it deserves, Behind the Candelabra remains amongst the best of the opening half of this year's film releases that I have seen, and particularly is the most genuine and purposeful.",8,1,3,17 June 2013
Django Unchained," The trailer had my curiosity, but the film now has my attention
","For some time now Django Unchained has had my curiosity...now that I've witnessed its spectacle, it has my undivided attention. Quentin Tarantino's latest endeavour takes us into his fictional historical tale of the deep south of the United States in the antebellum era. There are endless, near indescribable qualities that the modern spaghetti western remarkably presents. Everything Tarantino wants to accomplish, he achieves. If the director/writer means for you to laugh, you will laugh. If it's fun he's after, prepare to be entertained. In regards to emotion, for some, a spare Kleenex may be required to endure the brutality of slavery that has not been explored in such a graphic, yet ludicrously stylish manner in cinematic history.Never before have I wanted a hero to achieve so much in any fictional narrative. Our protagonist Django, so marvellously portrayed by Jamie Foxx, coincidently is released from the oppressive and immoral shackles of slavery by Dr. King Shultz (Christoph Waltz) in the opening scene of the film, and following the incredible introductions of these characters, they set out on an interdependent journey of bounty hunting, self-discovery and most importantly, the reuniting of Django and his wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington). I haven't really divulged anything that can't be ascertained from the trailer or synopsis of the western drama. Nonetheless, one cathartic response to Django Unchained that can only be obtained by actually going to experience the film in theatres is how much we relate and adore our heroic free man. When he cries, we cry. His desire for vengeance is our desire. Tarantino is not trying to create the most realist representation of antebellum slavery, but in fact provide a horrific account of the suffering that occurred in the unjust south. Though as I said, when the visionary filmmaker wants to entertain, he will entertain. For the most part, slavery and oppression are the consistent and ever-present motifs throughout the almost three hour film, and yet the outstanding performances, inconceivably sophisticated dialogue, beautiful cinematography, fantastic soundtrack, unpredictable plot and visual masterpiece enthral, excite and provide comedic relief at perfectly allocated times. Django Unchained almost has everything; spectacularly choreographed action, a great narrative, an intriguing setting, emotion, memorable quotes and character development are all present and appreciated thoroughly.The performances are almost beyond belief. The assimilation of this sensational cast, along with one of the greatest filmmakers and a talented crew, make for a theatrical experience that revives any doubts you may have on the power of motion picture performances. I cannot think of another film whereby deciding who my favourite character is makes me feel guilty for not choosing the others who are just as brilliant. Jamie Foxx, Christoph Waltz, Leonardo DiCaprio, Samuel L. Jackson and Kerry Washington not only play convincing characters, they convinced me I was with them in antebellum Mississippi due to the life, emotion and realism they bring to their respective and truly memorably distinctive roles. While we are supposed to root for our victims of the oppressive society and we certainly do, the antagonists Calvin Candie (DiCaprio) and his slave Stephen (Jackson) are nothing short of exceptional and intriguing to watch. The costume design is wonderful, the sets and locations the characters occupy are wondrous and as soon as you depart from your cinema seat, which you won't forget sitting in, you will find yourself being unable to replace the characters with other actors. Not only the primary characters, but the supporting cast are also irreplaceable and unforgettable to a perpetual degree.To those that regard Django Unchained as a Hollywood product of solely racial profanity and excessive violence, I say I respect your opinion, but do not be afraid of reality. The film embarks on the pinnacle time of white supremacy in the United States and while it sensationalises much of its content, the topic of slavery is not one that can ever be fully comprehended or physically depicted by those that have not lived through it. Therefore, Tarantino's work should be admired for its confidence to approach such a sensitive, serious and often overshadowed element of American and world history.At the risk of exhausting an abundance of synonyms for optimistic adjectives to express my adoration for Quentin Tarantino's phenomenal work of genius, I will bring my literary opinion of Django Unchained to a conclusion. I could persist and continue writing endlessly, which I would indeed find very enjoyable, though I have highlighted the fundamental aspects of the film that create my love for it. This isn't just the finest Tarantino has to offer, it is one of the most epic productions that the world of cinema has to offer. Though many were gifted with Django Unchained on Christmas Day, for me, the film has sparked a potentially inconceivable swarm of hopefully terrific films for the 2013 cinematic year, though I doubt any release will match the originality and style that Tarantino has gifted upon the world.",10,2,6,19 January 2013
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Two Hours of Fantasy That Has Something to Say About Reality
","Loosely based on the 1939 short story by James Thurber, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty explores the idyllic fantasies of its titular protagonist, as he attempts to escape the mundane motions of his daily routine employment at Life Magazine. When Mitty (Ben Stiller) discovers that photojournalist Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn) has misplaced negative 25, intended for the cover of the final print of the publication, he sets out on a larger-than-Life journey to locate the missing photograph, while reducing his need for daydreams as he discovers that not even his wildest fantasies are a match for an adventurous reality.In addition to starring, Stiller also takes on directing duty, and does a mostly wonderful job of collaborating with writer Steven Conrad in adapting Thurber's classic tale of a man's yearning for more out of life.A fantasy adventure with glimpses of comedy, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is, in one word, pleasant. Envision a pyramid of qualities; the film's dreamlike sequences comfortably and rightfully sit atop its magnitude of highlights. With the lines between fantasy and reality often being blurred in Mitty's zoned out state of paralysis, he invites us into his crazy, hazy, even mazy lapses into daydreams of romanticism, adventure and pleasure.Why are The Secret Life of Walter Mitty's fantasy sequences so successful? Because of their relation to our own imaginations: the things we wish we could say but don't; the places we wish we could go but won't. The film's fantasy references are inspired by popular movies such as The Matrix, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Harry Potter and pretty much every superhero film ever. This hilarious and creative approach to Mitty's fantasies offers an insightful look into how uninsightful our own imaginations can be, as they crave originality but settle for what has been imagined before.Perhaps a slight disappointment to Mitty's on screen daydreams is their quantity. While Thurber's short story is dominated by the character's constant drift into his fantasy worlds, Stiller's adaptation favours reality and narrative over fantasy and themes. The film's aforementioned highlights are too few and far between throughout the 114 minute feature. Thus, it may have been Beneficial for Stiller to lengthen the film slightly in order to incorporate more of Mitty's fantasies, which would have better established his dissatisfaction with life.Despite this, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty does have a story investing and intriguing enough for it not to be the film's demise. The secrecy behind negative 25 drives the film along, with love interest Cheryl (Kristen Wiig) also spurring Mitty on in the passenger's seat, inspiring the anxious and rigid dreamer to take his unpredictable ride and become the person he desires to be.The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is refreshing in its lack of reliance on dialogue. Instead, the film's beautiful soundtrack and score, cinematography in exceptional landscapes and even the quietness of Mitty, tells us pretty much everything we need to know. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty consists of visual wonderment, with superbly selected and composed music to harmonise the scenery, complementing each other as they stroll hand in hand through Mitty's perfectly paced journey.'Life is about courage and going into the unknown.' If you fail to relate to Mitty's early illusory state, cautiousness and absence of courage, then you probably live a somewhat audacious lifestyle, in which case good for you! For the rest of us, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a relatable, pleasant and semi-inspirational modernisation of Thurber's story.Just as the film's concluding third appears to have little payoff considering its memorable opening two, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty wraps up with a revitalising, picture-perfect moment, fulfilling enough to make cinema-goers reconsider 2013's most impressive movies. In spite of its imperfections in almost keeping Mitty's secret life somewhat of a secret from the audience at times, and preferencing the film's plot over his fantasies, this adaptation is nonetheless a satisfying, fun, visually and audibly pleasing present for the holiday season. Not even Walter Mitty would fantasise about battling you through the streets of Manhattan if you waited for The Secret Life of his on DVD or Netflix, but this delightful film is definitely worth the time and box office cost if you find yourself looking for inspiration for your own imagination.",9,89,135,27 December 2013
Lincoln," A greatly told story, of the story told the most frequently in American History
","Steven Spielberg's Lincoln consists of a unique quality, in that you know the outcome of the film before you even pull the handle of the door to the cinema screen the film is playing in, and yet the filmmakers still manage to keep the audience engaged, enthused and frequently amused. Just as scholars have praised Abraham Lincoln's political leadership as the key factor in accomplishing abolition, this 21st century film adaptation of the same man's life is primarily accomplished by the strong performance by Daniel-Day Lewis, in addition to an absolutely impeccable supporting cast. The first half is certainly not without its dull moments, though it is difficult to argue that the 150 minute feature-length needed to be shortened, due to the fact that every second of Lincoln is relevant, important and well-paced. Furthermore, the historical epic has been so incredibly produced and cared for that the film has a particular power of you; it grips the audience and transports each cinemagoer back to the 19th century, and you feel inferior and helpless to the situation that these historical figures must deal with. The climactic scene is the greatest example of this. Everything the film has led up to, everything these people have worked for (or against) and the defining moment in the political career and life of Abraham Lincoln is presented, edited and felt as nothing else but masterful. The only sound that can be heard in the theatre is the clasping together of hands in hope that history will translate to the outcome of the film. Of course, you know it will and yet the intensity that the writer, director, editor, actors and more create is of astounding cinematic quality.To attempt to articulate the sublimely outstanding acting performances throughout Lincoln would result in failure to accommodate those words with justice. Though now I feel the irony as I have very briefly attempted to do so. Though some cast members protrude more than others, not one role or performance can even be considered faintly weak or unconvincing. Subjectively speaking (as all reviews do), Tommy Lee Jones' phenomenal portrayal of Thaddeus Stevens is the greatest and most intriguing to have the privilege of witnessing, not just in this Spielberg epic, but in recent cinematic history. From his inception on the screen, you just continue to wish for him to reappear again in the next scene, and in the scenes he does, his superior feat as an actor, almost makes the others around him languish, though they most certainly do not. Lincoln is most definitely not the most entertaining of films, but it has no intention to be. On storytelling techniques alone, it reaches for the highest of quality while grabbing the audience and making us vulnerable to the powerful nature of the drama.",8,0,1,23 February 2013
Prometheus," Did it Ridley end like that?
","*I would first just like to apologise for the horrendous punny title. Unaware of its existence as a prequel to Ridley Scott's original 1979 Alien, I approached the 'first screen on your right (enjoy the film)' unknowledgeable, with exceedingly high expectations due to the unconventional word of mouth, natural technique of marketing.Aesthetically fulfilling does not do this picture justice. Its estimated $130 million budget enhances the attractiveness, but as we all know, money cannot buy personality. To commence, this film has a personality, a purpose, with an intriguing concept of space exploration in the hope of discovering mankind's greatest question of our existence, abolishing Darwinism in the process. Absurd right? Wrong, well wrong in terms of Ridley Scott's ability to explore some logic and reason behind the idea. Furthermore, we feel a great sense of humanity from our homo sapien (or not) protagonists, which brings it right back down to earth (pun intentional). Ironically however, our greatest sense of humanity establishes itself from our least human character, an android, David, portrayed by Michael Fassbender. His performance within the cast is that of a Usain Bolt on the race track, while the other racers are talented and adequate for their role, their names are forgotten amidst being outshined by the one, one step ahead of them in their respective profession.Prometheus emerges as another I can add to my collection. Abstract noun. The collection is a thought, consisting of many recent pictures I have seen, embarking on a pattern of decline; decline of quality, of substance, originality and self interest. A scatter graph presenting a negative correlation, we started so well, so high, yet we fell, fell to where we began, at the bottom. Null hypothesis? Down to chance? Absolutely not, Scott and the writers are well aware of their decision to leave aspects of the plot unresolved, and motives of the characters unexplained in order to accommodate for a sequel which will reportedly fill the gap between Prometheus and Alien. Necessary? No. After a strong first 50 minutes or so, this picture's tragic flaw is its acknowledgement that there is more to come from the Alien story, though this should not excuse the fact that the narrative is left as open as the Universe we live in, the one they are exploring. This film has, excuse me, HAD, as much potential as the ambition of Elizabeth Shaw (played by Noomi Rapace) and Chris Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) in their determination to meet our 'engineers', our creators. It could be an advantage of not knowing Prometheus to be a prequel because it enables one to objectively review the film for what it is. What it is is a motion picture that was begging to conclude itself and the ongoing series. Had Scott and the producers done this, Prometheus would have been a stand alone prequel that exceeded audience expectations, as well as my own.Sunshine + Alien vs. Predator = Prometheus is the best equation that can be used to describe the atmosphere outputted by the 30ft X 70ft screen (approximately). Forgive me for not having seen the 1979 original, so I can only assess this 2012 release against the more contemporary releases in the series, along with its similarities with the 2007 Danny Boyle sci-fi drama Sunshine. What does Prometheus equal? Unfortunately, too much of the prequel is left unanswered for that equation to be completed.",8,1,1,16 July 2012
The Wolverine," Clawed In From Beginning Until, Almost End
","Many had presumed that Marvel's mutated franchise and even their indestructible adamantium machine could not heal after the disappointing releases of X-Men: The Last Stand (2006) and then X-Men Origins: Wolverine in 2009. Nonetheless, the 2011 prequel X-Men: First Class and this 126 minute journey half way across the world to Japan have managed to mend these wounds. The Wolverine unleashes a fresh, X-citing and much anticipated focus on the character that is not impenetrable from criticism but is pretty much what any Wolverine fan and cinemagoer could have hoped for.The Wolverine opens with the titular character inexplicably placed in Nagasaki, where he rescues a military officer from the tragic atomic blast during The Second World War. In the present day, following the events of X-Men: The Last Stand, Logan, no longer considering himself the Wolverine, wanders the wilderness in anguish over the deaths of those close to him, which he must deal with eternally due to his curse of immortality. What sets this film apart from other comic-book adventures corresponds to what makes Wolverine a unique character. The Wolverine sees its anti- hero on a quest for death more so than anything else. He does not seek heroics, recognition, justice or anything good, only the privilege of an end to his everlasting misery by death, which is brought to life tremendously by the film's screenplay and of course the Wolverine himself: Hugh Jackman.The Wolverine calmly claws you in almost throughout its run in a beastly variety of ways. The Japanese landscapes provides a fresh setting, and makes the film visually interesting even when we are away from the action. Cinematographer Ross Emery captures the really X-traodinarily beautiful Japanese backdrops that are a refreshing change from New York skyscrapers.While The Wolverine is great to look at when the beast's claws are retracted, the film is equally appealing when a regrettable soul gives Wolverine a reason to unleash the beast within. Notably, a scene involving a moving train is Class 5, stands out most memorably as the strongest amongst the film's action sequences. The final battle, while albeit a little uninteresting due to its loudness and surrender to clichés, can be forgiven due to its eventual satisfactory outcome. One unfortunate element to the film that is less forgiving however, probably primarily from my own and comic-book fans' perspective, is the disappointing, unintimidating and lacklustre villain in Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova). The actress is just a little difficult to understand at times, through both voice, and the fact her and the character seem to hold no real motivation or clear threat.Unlike X-Men Origins: Wolverine, this significantly improved 2013 attempt is considerably well, more considerate to the character, with attention to plot, pacing and overall a more focused and consistent tone. The Wolverine dives claws first into the darkness of its protagonist, exploring how Logan's emotional scars cannot heal and are ever present, becoming increasingly burdening over time as he attempts to fix these unfixable wounds that torture him eternally.It is almost redundant at this stage, 13 years after the first X-Men film was released, to praise Hugh Jackman for his consistently tremendous and irreplaceable portrayal of Logan/Wolverine. Almost, but not quite. Redundancy can be sliced and forgotten because Jackman simply owns the role of the X-Men's most beloved mutant. I have my suspicions that he actually might be the Wolverine, because the actor does not appear to age and is getting increasingly powerful with each performance. Hugh Jackman simply dominates his character, and hopefully will continue to do so for as long as mutantly possible, which in Wolverine's case, should mean forever.The Wolverine is one best of the X-Men film franchise, with its cool story, fresh setting, great and appropriately slow pace for a broken character, X-citing action scenes and a mostly perfect cast. The Wolverine may be picked last in class when many retrospectively consider 2013's best comic book adaptations. However, the James Mangold film is so far the surprise pick of the pack as it has exceeded expectations and filled any dubious doubts with cinematic satisfaction. While not quite a match for Superman's Steel, Wolverine's adamantium has far surpassed Iron (Man 3) and now has cinema-goers, comic book fans and I, anticipating next year's addition to the mutated series, X-Men: Days of Future Past.",8,2,5,20 August 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," Perhaps a little disappointing, though not detrimental
","Narrative; the most significant aspect of any format of storytelling (opinion). 'The Dark Knight Rises' embarks on an almost generic and chaotic plot that is maintained well within the 165 minutes, though feels too majestic and grand, causing it ironically to lose its dignity from four years ago. Nolan's trilogy has however, established a great deal of morality within justice and democracy that is fore grounded for the audience and is the catalyst for the actions of our heroes and villains in each of the 21st century Batman films. The problem with 'The Dark Knight Rises' is the villains appear to carry two motives, while our heroes lack any motive other than prevention, unlike the strive for justice we witnessed in 2005 and 2008. The first intention from Batman's adversary Bane, as an almost fascist leader, is to encompass economic equilibrium within Gotham City due to his, as well as many other characters's disgust of financial imbalance throughout western civilisation. As a contemporary issue, this works as a sensational purpose of the film, and Bane's actions to complete his goal are phenomenally written and represented. Meanwhile however, the character possesses a secondary goal, and all that can be said of this intent is it so disappointingly generic and cliché to the action genre.The performances and casting are nothing short of spectacular, in fact, they are so far beyond spectacular that to describe Nolan's management of them all would result in one pondering for an inconceivable time. Tom Hardy expresses this dominant villain in Bane, whose voice engulfs the entire theatre each time his remarkable dialogue is heard. You feel his presence causing entrapment to your soul, and while menacing, is a beautiful sound that you may find trying to replicate yourself once at home. Though he does not quite exceed Heath Ledger's Joker as a motion picture comic book villain, in no way does the soon to be 35 year-old actor disappoint in what can only be described as an extraordinarily memorable role. Anne Hathaway also delivers a fantastic interpretation of Selina Kyle/Catwoman, with great qualities of an ambiguous anti-hero as she roams not in a pride, but as a lone creature within unique individual ideologies. At no point during the film does one find themselves questioning the importance or amount of screen time of any of the characters, they are managed with extreme care, and each provide the plot with a great distinctive personality and relevance. Furthermore, Nolan has once again ludicrously enabled his audience to adore the antagonists, primarily Bane 'of course', to the extent of wanting to see more of them than our heroes. This is an unbelievable ability the Nolan brothers and David S. Goyer possess, as despite their pure malevolence, or in their view, 'necessary evil', we continue to remember Nolan's Batman trilogy for the villains. 'Theatricality and deception' are quite modestly portrayed by Nolan in this picture. The modesty originates from almost taking for granted just how magnificent the overall cinematography is. You can almost create a mental list of aspects of the film which the entire production unit have impressively succeeded in delivering; tick off 99% of them while you are at it. One could probably close their eyes and simply listen for 165 minutes instead and still be astounded by the flawless dialogue and incredible score by Hans Zimmer. Simultaneously, the visual composition of each and every scene is impeccable; while particular scenes and camera shots leave you so engaged to the cinema screen that it is difficult to breakup your attention.There are few negative components of the conclusion to a sensational trilogy. In my personal opinion, we are not likely to see another Batman trilogy, wait, superhero trilogy, no, just trilogy that embarks on such a phenomenal balance in all its characteristics. 'The Dark Knight Rises' is a satisfactory ending to a great character, but by no means perfect. The incorporation of both styles from its two predecessors is excellently conceived and executed with minor issues that can for the most part be ignored because of the film's, and trilogy's overall tremendousness.",7,3,6,21 July 2012
The Croods," Beautiful Animation!
","Experiencing DreamWorks' The Croods leaps beyond giving you the feeling of a cinematic spectator, but instead the film actually accepts you as a member of the Crood family. This delightful animation follows a family of cave people as they are forced to depart from their comfort zone and embark on an adventure that will not only determine their physical and evolutionary survival, but also allow them to recognise that life can be worth living even when risks are taken.Out of respect for The Croods (the film and the family), it would only be fair to divulge the negative aspects of the animated film first before pouring out the praise. This is because the 98 minute feature itself thankfully reserves its lesser qualities for the first half of the film, before unveiling a sensationally satisfactory conclusion, as well as everything leading up to it. The Croods does suffer at times from some annoyingly loud and unfunny slapstick comedy that becomes borderline awkward in the confines of a theatre when not even the young children (the target demographic) are laughing. The humour most definitely is not intended to accommodate to all ages, though there are still plenty of laughs to be had, but you feel you are searching for them, rather than they are finding you. Furthermore, the 3D contributes nothing; as opposed to enhancing the experience, it actually (albeit only slightly) diminishes it. It should perhaps be known I am not a fan of 3D cinema anyway, but the visual novelty in The Croods really is questionable as not only is there no aesthetic augmentation, but the 3D in fact causes blurred vision when wanting you to focus on unimportant objects. The answer surely lies in the studio's economic, rather than artistic, justification. The animation itself is absolutely consistently energetic. It is both figuratively and literally full of life throughout, and the animators intentionally paint a bleakly coloured landscape for the initial setting of a repeated and oppressive lifestyle, before they allow a pallet of luminosity to blossom as the adventure commences and we and the characters are exposed to a greater sense of diversity. This parallels with the narrative of The Croods. The film essentially is a tug of war that sees the character Eep (voiced by Emma Stone) as the rope being pulled towards a life of safety and overprotectiveness by her father Grug (Nicholas Cage) while also allowing herself to be drawn to the exciting stranger guy named err... Guy (Ryan Reynolds). It is a battle between fear and hope and while Grug and Guy stand at the opposing ends of spectrum, the remaining characters are left to contemplate on which side they wish to be tempted towards.The comedy that is greatly genius in The Croods is that type of humour that humanises and personifies elements of primitive civilisation in a way that is updated so that modern beings can appreciate its cultural value. There are a number of really terrific comedic instances in the film that are aided by the perfect voice casting of the ensemble, but unfortunately these are often overshadowed by the abundance in dull physical humour. The characters that the actors voice are all likable in their own unique way, and cohesively lovable as a family. Like a family, you may find traits that you dislike, but in the end, you know that you love them.The Croods is certainly one of the superior animations that DreamWorks has to offer, though I would not necessarily guarantee that everyone will enjoy it as it becomes evident from the first second of the film that it has been made for a very young audience and is missing that adult appeal. The Croods is just a lot of fun with a predictable plot, but why regard that as negative criticism when in reality you desire for your predictions to come to fruition as you become so attached to this fictional family, especially at the surprisingly emotionally investing conclusion. No other two polysemic words could probably encapsulate the film more appropriately than: beautiful animation.",8,1,2,14 April 2013
Monsters University," Pixar Continue to Roar the Loudest
","The Incredible, Brave and universally Monstrous animation studio Pixar have undeniably been heard roaring the loudest with their 14 feature films amounting to their reputation at the forefront of motion picture animation, and film in general. The studio's small in number yet great in quality features make it unsurprising that there is a particular expectation for the animators to deliver more masterful art in the present and future. However, most recently Pixar have delved into the past with their first and very highly anticipated prequel, Monsters University.Monsters, Inc. (2001) brought Pixar into the 21st century by opening doors into an entirely unique universe for audiences of all ages to enter. 12 years later, and the children who grew up with Sully, Mike and the rest of Monstropolis have been invited back to experience a stage in these great characters' lives that many of us also find ourselves in: university. Monsters University sees Mike Wazowski and James P. Sullivan meet for the first time as they both desire to attain their major from the Scare Program but both have different views on how to pass the class. While Mike operates as the educated, hardworking, fearless yet physically unintimidating scarer, Sully excels fearsomely well at the scaring, but lacks the motivation, courage and book smarts Mike possesses, causing the pair to become rivals. The writers constructively use the beloved on screen relationship between Mike and Sully to explore their differences in Monsters University, which are ironically everything they need to complete each other as a pair, as classmates, as colleagues and as who knows what if Pixar decide to expand the Monsters franchise further. This prequel justifies itself solely in the exploration of Mike and Sully's match as the perfect scare team; yin and yang embodied on screen.As if Pixar were not punctual enough with the timely release of Monsters University (MU) for those who grew up with the original, but its setting also plays host to the film's central storyline which follows the MU Scare Games. With the release of this monster movie coinciding with the one year anniversary of the hugely successful London Olympics, Pixar manages to capture a marginal fictionalised element of magic that the 2012 Games accumulated, but a fraction alone is enough to captivate audiences, which Monsters University does indeed. The parallels between the challenges that the MU fraternities must face and those accomplished last summer are certainly not forced in this prequel, and so make for delightfully relevant entertainment as we see Mike and Sully reluctantly join the same fraternity to fight for their survival in the university's Scare Program, overcoming numerous, humorous obstacles along the way.Monsters University has a mix of fun features, all contained within a single, fun feature film. Whether you're a toy, bug, monster, fish, superhero, car, rat, robot or most likely just an everyday human, Monsters University will almost definitely delight and satisfy with enough laughs to energise the whole of Monstropolis. Pixar really unhooked the leash in 2013, having changed the tone from Monsters, Inc. whilst still managing to keep the collar on this prequel to ensure it belongs to the 2001 animation. While it lacks the heart and depth of the original, Monsters University surpasses its predecessor with a blend of humour, visual vibrancy and enough universityisms to keep any student mentally reaching out to the screen in relation, as the film reaches out to us in so many ways.Monsters University has many welcome throwbacks (or throw forwards chronologically speaking if you prefer) to Monsters, Inc. that are only supplementary magical moments to the energetic, Monstrously good, nonstop party of animated fun. Monsters University proves that Pixar can graduate to prequels and still remain successful. The studio has just about every metaphorical studious qualification imaginable, and yet their fantastic writers, directors, animators and actors continue to imagine and conceive new, unique artwork. This provides us with excellent family fun, heart-warming stories and allegories, with Monsters University as the latest, and certainly one of the greatest. In all fairness however, most of Pixar's features sit atop their greatest offerings as it is difficult to favour one over the other.",9,4,5,10 August 2013
Thor: The Dark World," Not Thorful, But Not Thorsome Either
","Thor: The Dark World expands on the beloved Marvel Cinematic Universe, quite literally, this time with one of the least exciting Avengers taking the spotlight for Hammertime.Despite the devoted fan-base of this incredible world of Marvel superheroes, you can't help but feel that Thor: The Dark World is the first instalment in the franchise to feel most contrived and out of place. Yet, this sequel is still a mild improvement on its predecessor, though together they combine for the weakest in the series of superhero films, even though Thor is probably the strongest out of the bunch. The film finds Thor doing his thing in Asgard, before his lady love Jane Foster conveniently stumbles upon a weapon known as the Aether, which the Dark Elf Malekith intends to use to destroy the universe. Asleep yet?Negativity aside, Thor: The Dark World is a mostly enjoyable comic-book flick with some superb action, actors and, I can't think of another word that begins with 'a' so, humour.For an incredibly cheesy character, Chris Hemsworth still has the oh my demigod factor to bring a great balance of confidence, charisma and physicality to the role of Thor. This can be said of all of the Asgardians, including Anthony Hopkins as Odin and Tom Hiddleston's fan- favourite portrayal of Loki. While narratively Thor: The Dark World is predominantly yawn-inspiring, the presence of Hiddleston's Loki compensates as fans are genuinely interested to see his current personality and relationship with Thor following the events of The Avengers in 2012. It is the human characters that are the dull, annoyingly cheesy and unnecessary obstacles that often get in the way of the overall pleasant 112 minute sequel. Notably, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) is used as a pathetic damsel in distress signal masquerading as a character with any significance, while Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings) is pretty much the idiotic joke machine waiting for her cue. These characters, along with the contrived villain Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) are really the Aether to what could have been a very promising second outing for Thor. With no disrespect to these actors whom deliver fine performances, it is their characters that suppress absolute enjoyment of Thor: The Dark World.Apologies for this tennis match I am having with myself in complementing and then hammering Thor: The Dark World's qualities; still I'll continue to play. More positively, the film is possibly the greatest comedic achievement for the superhero squadron on screen to date. One moment had the audience in an uproar of laughter; those that have seen it will know the moment, and those that are yet to see the film will know when they bear witness to its hilarity. Even during other scenes where the humour feels slightly inappropriate given the circumstances, you'll easily yield with laughter, or at the minimum, a low-key grin.It's almost superfluous today to commend a modern blockbuster for its CGI quality. However due to its stark visual improvement over its 2011 predecessor, Thor: The Dark World is certainly worth mentioning as an aesthetically potent force which makes the movie a Thorful lot of fun!Whilst the Thorsome Asgardian actors, humour and visual effects are enough to keep Marvel fans entertained for two short hands around the clock, it doesn't take too long to realise that Thor: The Dark World is probably the most forgettable and forced in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, though by no means the first for Marvel (I'm looking at you 'Amazing' Spider-Man). Thor's lack of character development since the end of Thor, along with the villain out of nowhere and no care Malekith make this sequel feel pretty purposeless in the grander scheme of things. And that's not even mentioning Jane Foster: Marvel's version of Daphne from Scooby-Doo, except more pointless, boring, unconvincing and no fun for anyone.After a Thortless and needlessly dull opening 45 minutes, Thor: The Dark World has plenty of surprises along the way to amuse the fandom inside of devotees, that'll shadow its flaws until you really start to think about the film, but it's some fun while it lasts.",6,0,1,22 December 2013
Flight," I'm on your schedule Captain
","Enter destination. Purchase tickets. 'No outside food or drink'. Second door on your right. Take seat. Await the journey that lies ahead. Once the ambiance is set and the morale of the cinema-goers is lifted at the conclusion of thirty minutes of abundant previews, Flight commences in a dramatic, surprising and frankly rather entertaining fashion. For the most part, the first half hour of the Robert Zemeckis film is everything you wanted and expected following your presumed consumption of the trailer beforehand. Unfortunately however, it becomes evident throughout the 138 minute feature that we are victims to a cinematic bait-and- switch, by which I mean our expectations become decreasingly fulfilled and the film's title only supplements the key theme of substance addiction, that is ever-present in the character Whip Whitaker's life.The first 30 minutes of Flight are cared for with a great deal of delicacy. We encounter THE scene of the film; the title scene, the scene that most likely sparked 90% of the viewers' interest to actually go to see the film in the first place. How does this sequence levitate against our expectations? Above and beyond without question. The entire scene engulfs the theatre seat occupiers as much as it does those in the plane seats. You feel you are them. Almost all camera shots are interior, enforcing the claustrophobia, panic, and gasps in the environment, all of which are difficult to differentiate between the characters in the film and the cinema-goers surrounding you. Other incredible gripping scenes later in the film focus entirely on drama and realism. Protagonist Whip's battle with alcoholism is treated as the primary focus of the feature, and if not for the strong performances, the film would have fallen apart from the opening credits, like the runner who forgot to stretch or the student who was too lazy to take notes. Something that may be taken for granted is in fact the key component which helps bring Flight home safely and satisfactorily. Denzel Washington's role as an intoxicated and irresponsible pilot makes the film alone worth seeing. Every time he makes a morally questionable decision, we the audience react in a manner that parallels the game show enthusiast's desire for gratification. You almost want to scream and the screen each time Whip makes a decision you are not fond of, though still wish to see where it takes the film. You never want him to succeed in the sense that he desires, but more achieve success through facing his responsibilities. He is a broken character, a tragic hero, perhaps relatable to some, but certainly intriguing to all.Regrettably, from takeoff Flight suffers from instances of turbulence and an unwanted delay. Kelly Reilly injects a fine performance as Nicole, who eventually meets Whip and their mutual difficulties with substance abuse elicit a romance that should have never boarded the Flight. Her existence in the film is irrelevant and increases running time also, though there is never a dull moment in the 138 minute picture, therefore the integration of this romance will probably please some, though I most definitely declare my slight annoyance at its unnecessary presence. Zemeckis rectifies the troubling turbulence by securely landing into a graceful and exceedingly fulfilling conclusion. He essentially does what Denzel Washington's character does, by taking control over his line of work and doing a great job of it, until some slight mishaps that needed correcting, otherwise they both would have headed for disaster. The director saves his film with a remarkably powerful conclusion that really could not have given you anymore that it provided. Hopefully Zemeckis was not under the influence of any illegal or physically altering substance during principal photography, though if he was, he sure did a fantastic job of completing a very fine project.",7,2,3,14 February 2013
The Purge," A Unique Premise, Spoiled By Descent Into Idiocy
","Even with an extremely strong and enticing premise at the forefront to paint over the array of farcical stupidity and predictability, The Purge's core foundation that caused audiences to stop and stare is unable to completely gloss over the film's plethora of flaws as they seep through the cracks. The finishing coat that is the idea behind the film does just about enough to prevail and not fade away to the questionable layers beneath it. The Purge follows a family's struggle on one very 'special' night of the year; a night in the near future, where all crime is legal (including murder) and emergency services are disbanded for a period of twelve hours, which has radically reduced crime and allows for economic prosperity throughout the rest of the year. That premise alone intrigues via only a simple synopsis, and in the film, this fascinating night just about maintains what could have been a disastrous and laughable trip to the cinema, as a moderately enjoyable one.The Purge successfully creates its world in the opening title sequence. You instantly believe and accept the film's set-up and despite some annoying characters, the film undeniably has your attention, if only for a little while longer. The greatest feature of The Purge is its ability to remain relevant, before, during and after seeing it. While many may remember it for the wrong reasons, it can certainly impress by encouraging the audience to consider during to themselves, and ask aloud to those around them after, 'What would you do in that situation?' The trailer reveals the family's son as a young and somewhat idealistic figure whom opens the family's security system to allow an unknown victim of the purge to find solace in their home. Would you risk your own safety for the potential rescue of a wounded stranger? These are the kinds of questions that The Purge elicits very triumphantly, and it is nothing but a shame that these social, moral issues were not delved into more critically. The Purge is a film that should be remade into a drama/thriller piece, taken more seriously and produced more coherently to restore its purpose that got lost along the way of this 2013 supposedly 'horror' effort. It doesn't really warrant the categorisation of horror, due its lack of fear inducing power other than a couple of jump scares.The Purge manages to defy logic and reason on multiple levels, and not the levels that one would expect it to. The film in fact has a very convincing, albeit radical, premise that you adopt as reality, and with its rising action to maintain a sense of intensity rather than fear, The Purge disappoints by behaving foolishly elsewhere. First and foremost, the decisions of certain characters make little to no sense, leaving the audience to ponder over their judgement, rather than remain engaged with the film itself. Additionally, The Purge treats, or more so mistreats its audience very condescendingly, to the extent that you actually question whether the filmmakers just gave up trying to convince anyone of anything half way through production. There are countless instances of characters being save 'just in the nick of time', and it becomes frustratingly disappointing as after the first successful try, they just continue to demean all viewers by creating a idiotically predictable plot that a toddler could decipher in seconds.On the arrival of that moment in The Purge when you come to the realisation that it failed to live up to expectation and is disregarding so much logic and reason that you think at any time gravity might be dismissed, then you can finally just have fun with the film. Despite its refreshing premise, The Purge breaks its promise of being an inviting social commentary and becomes a simply disappointing yet watchable slasher-like flick.Oddly, I would have to concede that in spite of all of my hate for The Purge's silliness, woeful acting by some, and the frustrating delusional mentality of many of its characters, the film is overall still reasonably enjoyable and not completely worthless. In fact, it is certainly worthwhile, which is exclusively attributable to the conception of the foundational idea that is required to juggle the remaining frightful (not in the intended manner) features of the film, whilst balancing itself. Unfortunately, many of these features are such abysmal that The Purge's premise can only handle so much responsibility, and many of these disastrous elements of the film fall to the ground, in the mud, where they belong. Nonetheless, The Purge is memorable for its highly unique criminological approach that maintains intrigue throughout most of the film, and shall perhaps linger importantly for its impressive aptitude for giving the audience something to debate amongst themselves after walking out of the 85 minute feature.",6,1,1,18 June 2013
Looper," Looper, or Blooper?
","What did I want from Looper? Rian Johnson's science fiction film throws you right into the loop, so why not do the same?Picture a tennis match between Roger Federer and a P.E. teacher. That could be the finest method of description for this cycle of exchange in quality. We were served with a highly original premise that set us up for a thrilling two hours, only for the return to be anything but. The binary opposition in this picture that is foremost conspicuous, regards no thematic presence, yet is the conflict of quality and enjoyment you attain from it. Some moments in Looper are highly respectable; we are witnesses to great acting, a unique premise and sensationally explained narrative complexities. When dealing with time travel in film, the likelihood of having your audience disperse from the theatre with more questions to ask than they had before they arrived is not uncommon. Looper phenomenally clarifies the enquiries you may have gathered throughout the feature, though it fails in many other respects. If maintaining its form as a time travel film was not intricate enough, the writer decides to evolve the concept of telekinesis within the already crowded plot. Though we are lead to believe this incorporation exists as no more than a device to show us of the 2044 time period, we eventually discover its fundamental contribution to the climax. This is disappointing. You begin to suspect the projectionist of switching reels with a different film, as you feel two separate stories are being told, and all you paid to see was Joseph Gordon-Levitt's interaction with Bruce Willis (his older self), which you get briefly, and is the prominence of pleasure one gains from the film. Another disappointing element to Looper would be its unnecessary inclusion of comedy and romance. I have no issue with these genres, though I must when their involvement in a narrative has about as much place as Looper will in my DVD collection. It will not be there! If one is to integrate these aspects into an abundant plot, at least do so with some class or dignity. The humour was so forced, you almost felt as if you had to laugh to prevent the screening from feeling awkward; the editor seemingly permits moments of silence for us to commence in robotic laughter, though I am confident in saying it failed to work. Meanwhile, Sara (Emily Blunt) engages in an inevitable yet needless instance of intimacy with Joe (Gordon-Levitt), which is not again revisited and you feel no desire for their peculiar relationship to progress, if initiate at all. While minor components of the two hours, these, along with the evolution of telekinetic powers cause a dynamic post-summer blockbuster, where dynamic is not a positive, and renovates Looper into our final product and perhaps more appropriate title: Blooper.So, what did I want from Looper? The theatrical trailers and copious varied marketing insinuated a simple narrative, as simple as time travel can be. By this, I mean the underlying premise of our protagonist Joe and the complications that arise with his future self. While this occurred at times during the 118 minutes, the enjoyment levels were indeed elevated amongst the otherwise unsatisfactory sequences, that the studios' marketing departments did a capital job of concealing. Taken as a whole, Looper certainly does not fulfil the expectations, principally due its attempt to show and tell too much, like the kid whose plentiful discussion on their generic item overshadows the next child on the list with their time machine, whom gets cut short because of their disappointing predecessor.",6,3,7,21 October 2012
Cloud Atlas," A Mesmerizing Premise, That Lives Up to Its Promise!
","Forget all that cinema has taught you. If you can manage to not use fabricated expectations that you have gathered throughout your cinematic life when experiencing Cloud Atlas, then the altitude of enjoyment you are left with following the film, will be elevated amongst some of the other most original concepts film has to offer. Yes, Cloud Atlas does contain familiar storytelling elements, but no, they are not enhanced and adapted into conventional territory; in fact, quite the opposite. The trailer prepares you well, without giving much of the plot away, in that the tone is set and you are prepared to be mesmerised by the power of being told a similar story several times over, though they are adapted to different spatial and cultural contexts. Cloud Atlas is one of those rare visual experiences whereby you take an outsider's perspective of reality, as the film's originality in embarking on a mythology of ancestry and its message alone are enough for you to continue discussion on its brilliance for generations to come; though I am sure our descendents will have another approach to this work of art.My apologies if that perplexing piece of prose above did not make the slightest bit of sense. There are just too many points of celebration to enforce onto my appreciation for this magnificent film, and trying to encompass each of them within a single piece of writing is rather difficult when even the premise is a potential topic of ongoing discussion. The acting, editing, costume design, stunning visual effects, dialogue/language use and many other superb elements in Cloud Atlas are almost taken for granted; they are left in the backdrop in order to supplement the sensationally superior foregrounded concept that makes this feature unique. We are taken on a magnificently original journey, that is aided by the seamless editing as we leap from era to era: one moment we are dealing with the issue of 19th century slavery, and the next shot will see us transported to a future post apocalyptic condition with similar oppression. The beauty lies within seeing the similarities of each generation that they pass on to the next, which saddens and intrigues at the same time. It certainly does take perhaps a few seconds to realise that the film has shifted in time, and for you to draw the necessary parallels between characters that make up the story, though once you fit these puzzle pieces into place, you see the utter genius and appreciate the film for all of its gloriousness. This could quite possibly be the worst film for attempting to leave your seat for a restroom break or to purchase refreshments. I would recommend holding it in/refraining from wasting your money. Missing a second of Cloud Atlas (not that you would want to) results in becoming more lost than skipping an episode of, well...LOST. Every single second of the 172 minute feature is imperative to comprehending the narrative as a whole. The film certainly requires your absolute attention, though that is no issue as there is no other way to feel about Cloud Atlas in its entirety, than intrigued. In fact, you are so intrigued that watching the film for a second time would probably be as useful to grasping all of the aspects to the plot, as much as it would be for your reinforced enjoyment. After an incredible first hour of primarily exposition, there is a brief inkling that the film will suffer from an inevitable decadence because of the inconceivable strength it has exhibited so far. Surely, it cannot endure additional weight to the narrative and take the pressure of our developed expectations? Well it does, and in spectacular fashion! Cloud Atlas actually gets better as we progress through the modified three-act structure. It climbs to a beautiful climax (plural?) and its two main overarching stories draw themselves to such a satisfactory conclusion that you want to stand and applaud before running to tell every human being that if they have the opportunity, to go and experience Cloud Atlas. Those that believe Cloud Atlas is just another drop in an ocean of insignificant and forgettable modern cinema, I say 'What is an ocean but a multitude of drops?' and this is in an instance when this particular film has the stature of a rogue wave when up against the majority of other theatrical releases that drop into our cinemas.",9,3,5,27 February 2013
The Great Gatsby," Nice Try Old Sport
","Baz Luhrmann commits infidelity in a treacherous betrayal to F. Scott Fitzgerald as he is lured towards a modern, more attractive mistress named Style. This affliction with unnecessary aesthetic causes The Great Gatsby to appear disloyal to the novelist's source material. While Luhrmann often returns to Fitzgerald at instances of faithfulness, too frequently he is enticed by Style, all the while leaving substance to be 'borne back ceaselessly into the past.'Literary adaptations are always difficult to execute perfectly, partially due to the variety of interpretations that page readers have on a particular text, partly because not all screen viewers have even read the literature in question, and primarily since cinematic perfection cannot exist as not all would agree on it. It is even more difficult, as a reader turned viewer, to leave your novelistic perspective at home. All this considered seems an unavoidable detriment to The Great Gatsby as a motion picture. Baz Luhrmann's interpretation of the 1925 Jazz Age novel simply feels far to contrived, for a story that deals with themes of such realism. The film contradicts itself in its collision between incessant noises, artsy visuals and disloyalty, and then eventual credibility through dramatic action and characterisation. The Great Gatsby is far from being a narrative regarding the binary opposites of good and bad, though these themes manage to organically surface by themselves through the conflict that Luhrmann implements between aesthetic artificiality and genuine storytelling.Thankfully, The Great Gatsby offers its least genuine, borderline unbearable act for the opening 45 minutes, though this sense of near cinematic torture continues to emerge, though less frequently, throughout the picture. It is unfortunately this opening act that leaves a bad taste in your mouth, a ringing in your ears and a stain on your retinas. It cannot be described more appropriately than deafeningly loud and unnecessarily stylised, causing absolutely nothing to feel important as your brain is just trying to process the narration, dialogue, diegetic and non-diegetic sounds that are each battling for supremacy. The desire to cover your ears is only prevented by the knowledge that you will then have to withstand the visuals alone. The film throws such a variety of information at us that we cannot appreciate or take notice of anything in particular. Gatsby's introduction feels as important as a speck of dust on Nick Carraway's tie. Furthermore, the snappy editing techniques incorporated just assist in giving The Great Gatsby a sense of delusion and vertigo, which really needs to settle down before it causes irreversible cognitive harm to its audience.Like a babysitter's hopes for the misbehaving child to calm down, our wishes are answered as following an abundance of hyperactivity, The Great Gatsby becomes a more endurable, peaceful and in fact quite magnificent drama film. As our two paramours eventually acknowledge one another, the volume lessens, and the film becomes a story not an acid trip. It is only from this moment in the film when one can finally begin to enjoy and care about any character, relationship or any aspect at all for that matter. The Great Gatsby becomes and exceeds our expectations. It fulfils the literary imagery (if you have read it) placed into your mind by Fitzgerald's novel during that first reading. For those that haven't, you finally, albeit behind schedule, are introduced to these wonderfully broken souls. These lost, tragic, misunderstood souls are portrayed quite phenomenally by an exceptionally talented cast. Leonardo DiCaprio is Jay Gatsby; Carey Mulligan is Daisy Buchanan; Tobey Maguire is Nick Carraway; Joel Edgerton is Tom Buchanan; and that's not just because the credits tell us so, it is due to their ownership over their respective roles and fulfilment of our expectations of their literary description.Now back to my dislikes for the film, which I only think is fair as The Great Gatsby itself negotiates between giving the audience what they came to see, and disappointing them beyond belief and so I shall negotiate between what the feature does greatly, and what it does not. This convergence of polarised characteristics within one film is most evidently seen, and heard, through the party scenes, in addition to the hugely dubious soundtrack choices. While actually outwardly suitable and creative for the promotional trailers for the film, when translated into the feature itself, the musical choices of Kanye West, Jay-Z amongst other contemporary artists are so unfitting that you feel it is repeatedly necessary to ask the musical supervisor to check if they have the right pair somewhere else. Meanwhile, the oddly choreographed party scenes are constructed for no purpose other than to appeal to a modern, young and presumably intoxicated audience. In coalition, these two elements feel more like we are in an updated version of the 1920s (the era of Fitzgerald's novel), rather than the era itself. You feel you are being thrown through Luhrmann's time machine as you enter different periods and this is not as enjoyable as you think time travel could be.Like Gatsby himself, the film is introduced as a perplexing mystery, and much like the film itself, you contemplate on how much you think you know and are understanding, though I am sure this parallel was not the intention of Luhrmann. Overall, a forgivably improved second half and a more than satisfying emotional conclusion leaves Baz Luhrmann's piece, not quite at master status, but as an enjoyable yet disappointing journey to see The ( ) Gatsby, that was missing its Great.",6,0,2,22 May 2013
