The Expendables 2," Below Average- these stars must have been hurting for some extra spending cash
","I was expecting a pretty decent movie, what with all the action stars in this movie. I enjoyed the first one, so I admit, maybe I held my hopes a little too high. This movie was definitely not what I was hoping for in an action movie. It consisted of expert marksmen bad guys missing every shot, a fatal flaw in many hopeful movies that turn out to be busts. It was just too unrealistic. I get it, you don't want your stars to get shot, but come on! Really?! Only one of them got shot throughout the whole movie and wasn't even badly injured. And if course, what would a failed action movie be without all,of toe good guys shouting out unnecessary, melodramatic, run of the mill battle cries. Okay, your trying to be funny, but after the twentieth time, it gets kind of old, don't you think? I mean, one of the goo guys dies in the first thirty minutes?! Come on! And hen you have a gun, and the bad guy doesn't, and he tries to taunt you into hand to hand combat, just don't. Shoot him on the spot. Actually, the only good thing in this movie was the hand to hand combat. That and Chuck Norris and Arnold Schwarzenegger's banter. At least that was not overdone. This is one of those movies where you already know the story because it has been done so many times. It's tired and worn out, Sylvester is trying to hard to be that young action star he once was with all that eager wit, but sadly, he doesn't measure up. It was almost as of this movie couldn't figure out if it was going to be a gory comedy or a serious action flick. Also the romantic side of Sylvester just did jot do. it was not working out.I can see how some might like it, and I suggest you watch it to generate your own opinion. This is just my opinion and mine alone. It had some great potential and room to work with, but it just wasn't enough. The story line lagged. Also, the ending when the girlfriend gets the letter. She was not nearly emotional enough. Your boyfriend died. Cry a little!!!",5,0,0,20 November 2012
The Hunger Games," Best book adaptation since the first Harry Potter!
","I read the series and have fallen in love and obsessed over them, so when I went to the movies to see this, I had high expectations. And it did not fail. Sure there are some differences, but you can't exactly fit a everything in a 400 something page book into a 1 and a half hour movie. The casting was phenomenal and the set was stupendous. I can not wait for Catching Fire! I think that the production team did a great job. Jennifer Lawrence was the best choice for Katniss and Josh Hutcherson as Peeta was an amazing choice, and he did a fantastic job. I believe Rue was also magnificently cast, as was Alexander Ludwig as Cato. I am glad they chose some lesser known actors for the parts and not major Hollywood stars, because this movie was not meant to be a star studded Expendables type action film, but it was made for the book lovers and true Mockingjay fans. They left out some important parts, but they made it as close as they could to the series and did great. If you are looking for a If you h action film with great acting, then this is the movie for you. The relationships between the characters were well established, especially between Katniss and Cinna and Katniss and Peeta. Jennifer does a great job portraying Katniss's emotions to the audience and letting us get to know her as a detailed, emotional character. If you have not yet seen this movie or read the books, I highly recommend them. They will not let you down. If you are a fan of Harry Potter than this is definitely a must see for you. Not only does it have great acting, but we can actually see the characters grow throughout the movie and gain respect and feelings towards one another. The book and movie are extremely close and of curse the books are always better than the movies. There is no way to completely transform The Hunger Games novel into a movie due to the immense details in the book, but this movie is definitely the closest anyone can get to capturing the wonderful book into the time allotted for the movie. Hopefully people enjoy it as much as I do and fall in love with it enough to go out and buy the series that everyone is calling the greatest series ever written, and rightly so. This movie and the cast and crew deserve more credit and praise for their amazing work.... a job well done! My only problem is I wish that they had established more into detail the districts and which one does which. Also, I was disappointed that they l left out Madge but I guess they didn't have time for such a small character and felt that they could cut her character out to save time and avoid having to establish the importance of yet another character.",7,1,7,8 April 2012
Inception," Twist ending that most people don't pick up on
","When I saw this movie, I was not expecting much. I was told that it was long and hard to keep up with. This was by far NOT the case. This movie was sensational, jaw dropping, edge of your seat, arm rest gripping, and had one of the bets endings I've ever seen.A lot of people don't realize the fact that the top is not his, but Mal, his wife's, totem. Therefore, the ending scene, when he spins the top isn't important, because it is not his totem. If you notice, when Cobb is in a dream, he is wearing his wedding ring. And when he is in reality, he is not wearing the ring. At the end of the movie, he is not wearing the ring, leading you to believe that it is in fact reality.On the other hand, many people believe his children's face to be the totem, which is also a completely plausible idea. It would explain why he looks away when Mal tried to make him look in the dream. Also, at the end when he finally looked to see his children's faces, it shows you that it is in fact reality.This leads you to believe that the only explanation is that he does, in fact, end up in reality. It doesn't matter whether or not the ring or the child's faces are the totem, all that matters is that he ends up back home to finally see his kids.All in all, this movie was a fantastic display of acting, action, and drama. The concept was unique and definitely interesting as it attracted and kept your attention the whole way through.DiCaprio's outstanding and immensely astonishing acting was by far one of the best parts of this movie. Leading up the casts, he was sensational and worthy of praise.And we can't forget Joseph Gordon Levitt who really made his character believable and certainly entertaining for the audience.And last but not least, Ellen Paige, who could do no wrong in this movie, as she portrayed someone who really listened to what Cobb's had to say and was truly relatable.",8,2,6,15 March 2013
