The Expendables 2," old men past their sell by date embarrass themselves
","This movie, like the first Expendables, is utter garbage. It has practically nothing going for it. The script is nonexistent, the attempts at humour are excruciatingly embarrassing and the final fight scene is amateurish. The cinemaphotography is strangely cheap and grainy looking. The main cast are far too old for this kind of thing, which is a shame since some of them were successful back in the day.There is some entertainment to be had, primarily at the awful dialogue, Norris and Stallone's bad hairpieces. My wife was in hysterics at the entrance of Chuck Norris as some kind of iconic actor. Chuck Norris was a strictly b-movie actor even in his heyday and his heyday was a long long time ago.This is not worth paying to see. If you're desperate wait for it on DVD.",1,86,153,5 September 2012
The Adventures of Tintin," wait for the DVD
","I have to start by saying that I'm totally unfamiliar with Tintin. I'd heard that there was a cartoon series years back but had never watched it.I vaguely remember various controversies about the comic strip being anti-American, pro-nazi or racist. I assumed that these elements would be sanitized from the film.So going in as a person with an open mind and no expectations? The Adventures Of Tintin is pretty meh. Its not awful but its not good.Given the high profile names and talent involved it should have been much better.That's not to say it's all bad. There are a couple of nice moments.The nice moments probably came from Wright who unfortunately left the picture. I'm deliberately keeping the review spoiler-free plot wise but would add that I don't get this style of animation.I saw this at a screening but there's been no marketing for this that I've seen.I think this left me with a similar feeling to Cowboys and Aliens. Not bad but underwhelming and left me with a vague sense of disappointment .",4,12,143,18 October 2011
The Expendables," these guys are too old
","I do not wish to sound ageist because with a good actor and script there is no reason that an action hero can't be an older guy. Take a look at Harrison Ford, Liam Neeson and others. They bring experience and authority to their performances.Unfortunately Stallone is not anywhere close to Ford or Neeson in terms of talent or presence. He's just a bodybuilder who can't accept that he's old. Sly maybe his nickname but its the quality that is sadly missing from his performance.He still thinks audiences want comic strip movies about remorseless killing machines. He still (unbelievably) thinks audiences seem him as a tough, virile man. He is wrong.The script and direction are rubbish. I didn't pay to see this and I can't suggest that anyone else does either.",1,17,47,13 August 2010
Trouble with the Curve," eastwood has lost it
","You know a movie is in trouble when they cast Justin Timberlake in a lead role. Justin 'big chin' Timberlake!.This is a bittersweet baseball movie with a good performance by Amy Adams and Matthew Lillard plus a workmanlike performance by Eastwood.Obviously hoping to ape the success of Million Dollar Baby. Unfortunately the script is so utterly predictable and clich√©d. You know how each one of the one-dimensional characters will turn out, what the complications will be and how they'll end up resolved. There are no surprises. Its a movie to have on in the background or to doze off to, so wait for it on TV.the movie deserves more than a 1 but I'm rating it lower to counter all the fake glowing reviews. The cinema was nearly empty when I saw it but maybe all those empty chairs were audience members that only Eastwood could see",1,16,34,24 September 2012
The Bourne Legacy," best movie of 2012
","I love this movie. It is incredibly suspenseful. The opening minutes are confusing but they serve as a great introduction to Jeremy Renner's new character Aaron Cross. We are reminded of the ending to the previous film in the series. Things are aided by the introduction of Rachel Weisz. Her character is menaced early on, only to be assisted by Cross. Renner and Cross give exceptional performances and support from Ed Norton, Stacy Keach and the rest of the cast.The writer and director Tony Gilroy does a fantastically assured job, ratcheting up the tension to almost unbearable levels in places. The climax of the movie is a stunning chase sequence which took my breath away.",10,12,22,5 September 2012
