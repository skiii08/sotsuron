The Monuments Men," Heroes come in all shapes and sizes
","The best thing about The Monuments Men is the idea of it, that it is based on fact, that all the characters exist on a human scale. As one who is utterly and completely exhausted with superheroes and end-of-the-world scenarios, it gives me great joy to see a portrayal of ordinary people who gathered their courage to oppose evil.As to the film itself, it is workmanlike and professional. Clooney, Damon, Murray, Goodman, et al, seem to be enjoying the old-fashioned storytelling. I thought Cate Blanchette somewhat miscast until that scene in the railroad yard.I'm fairly knowledgeable about art, so I didn't need the history lesson, but the general public will. If a lecture is required to learn, then give the lecture, and have the viewer learn the lesson.Movies need not be empty-minded. Take the children, teach them that art and humanity should be cherished, even in time of war. Stay to the very end and take a good look at the old man in the museum.",Null,0,0,26 February 2014
