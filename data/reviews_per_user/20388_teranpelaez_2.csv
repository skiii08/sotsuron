Blade Runner 2049," Watch it at home
","Here's the shortest review:It's a visual masterpiece for sure, the shots are amazing, the city feels real, everything looks greatÂ… but the film was a snooze fest. Too slow-paced at times, too many scenes that don't connect properly to the next scene. I looked at my watch twice to calculate how much longer this would take.The back story is fantastic though, the dystopia presented and everything that comes with it. Just watch it at home at your own pace.",5,6,13,22 October 2017
Bird Box," It's OK.
",It's a better executed version of 'The Happening' but it's still not a great movie. The ending is not great and we are left with all questions unanswered.,6,0,3,1 January 2019
