Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Good Intro - Good FX - Plot?????
","I sent a friend to get my ticket on only the second day of this film's release in eager anticipation of actually seeing Star Wars on the big screen for the first time. I'm no SW addict as you might assume. I have just four points: 1). It's a great intro piece for the rest of the prequels. 2). The new FX (especially the pod race) are some of the best I've seen. 3). All the acting was flat, apart from the mother who was probably the best of the lot, but to be fair they didn't have much to go on with... 4). No independent plot on which you would expect to form the movie. Overall: not too bad - eagerly awaiting the next ones!!",Null,0,0,16 June 1999
