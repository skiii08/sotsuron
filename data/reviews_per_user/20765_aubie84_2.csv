First Man," Man Of Man... Firstly
","I am a military dad and space buff- and I don't usually write reviews- but just finishing this movie, I had to reach for the tablet. Going into this movie, ya need to know, that yep, the show is about the space program...But, it's more about a brooding, melancholic, biopic of life trials on Neil Armstrong. 40% about Space- 60% of melo-drama about a talented pilot, about to 'snap' at his family, his teammates, and the military. And it's well done- It's just tough events in a tone of depressed, stressed chronicles leaving you with No joy or elation or even pride of American, patriotic accomplishment. 180 from flick The Right Stuff- Toward end , I wanted to get the guy some Prozac or Zoloft... Don't regret watching - but wasn't prepared for the down slope moody perspective and heavy drama slant. Worth it for the basics of events and shots of rockets, aircraft, & lunar scenes. Thanks for reading- hope this helps- Mike-Atl.",7,1,1,28 February 2020
1917," Why Write a Movie, when you can Just take a Plot from Saving Private Ryan & Adapt it to Different War...
","I could do well making a (Top 5 movie) copy, say Kindler's List, or 1915- and use the same premise... but how inventive and creative would that be? Already proven to be exceptional, the SPR formula is a War masterpiece- but to call this movie an achievement, well, not really, as it's been done before. I like the movie, a lot. It just seems that folks making the big bucks in cinema today, should be paid to 'Innovate'... not Imitate.",8,2,10,1 January 2020
