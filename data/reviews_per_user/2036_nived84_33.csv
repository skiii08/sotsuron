Mission: Impossible III," The third times the charm
","For about the first hour and a half Mission: Impossible 3 is the most intense and exciting and quite possibly the sharpest executed Mission yet, but once it gets to the last twenty minutes things start to fall a little out of place, but your heart will be pounding until the last frame. The film tries to combine elements of the first two films; the intelligence and surprising plot twist of the first film, and the intense, loud action of the second, but part three does try to do one thing different that has yet to be done; giving our main hero and lead spy, Ethan Hunt a personal life, and you don't have to have seen True Lies or the first few episodes of Alias (which was created by J.J. Abrams) to know that spies can't have a personal life, it just flat out doesn't work. Just ask Jason Bourne. I originally thought, 'Well this is going to be interesting, it's going to get really personal, and I bet that'll make it much more intense. Cool.' But what this really does is shift the focus of the film from 'the mission' to Hunt's wife, whose life is now in jeopardy. Hmmm... that doesn't sound much different from the last thirty minutes of M:I-2 does it?M:I:III isn't really that much different from the other films in the series, and some people might come out saying that this installment is the best of the series. The film does show us for the first time just how a real IMF team carries out missions, which is kind of strange to think that only by the time we get to the third film in the series that it feels like we're seeing it all for the first time. And do you remember how in the first two movies Hunt used a number of face masks to disguise himself? Well we finally get to see where those masks come from and how they are made, and we also get to see how they get their voice to pull the whole trick off, which was actually pretty neat to watch. What's also pretty cool is the variety of missions and different locations that M:I:III travels to; from Berlin to Washington, D.C. to Vatican City and finally ending up in Shanghai, which all makes for some very interesting scenery.The plot is somewhat hard to explain, mostly because it's so vague it's really hard to conclude just what in the hell was actually going on. It's not quite complicated in a fun and interesting way like the first film, and it's not as easy to follow as the second. The film is over stuff with big action stunts and loud shootouts. This film is easily packed with more action than the first two films combined, but there's no real flow to it all like M:I-2, but some of these scenes early on are quite exciting and highly energetic and thrilling, like one particular scene where Hunt has to jump off the roof a skyscraper in Shanghai (which looks like an amazing city at night I must say) only to swing over and crash on top of the building next to it, but overall this movie does feel like a really intense two hour episode of Alias, and I'd expect a little more from Cruise, but this is pretty much exactly what I would have expected from director Abrams.The romance that the film is built upon isn't that convincing, probably just as convincing as the one in the last movie, but here we are just forced to 'accept it' and move on. The film also tries to inject a little humor that wasn't really present in the first two films. Shaun of the Dead's Simon Pegg plays Hunt's techno. guru that did manage to make me laugh, but casting Pegg in a small role wasn't the only good choice in casting, no; the film is pretty well cast throughout; from Keri Russell as Hunt's protégé to Billy Crudup as an IMF team manager, Laurence Fishburne as the IMF operations director and Philip Seymour Hoffman as the icy villain, but they are all underused, which is a damn shame, and even though these are all great choices and it certainly keeps the film entertaining and exciting.Part of M:I:III is brilliant and some of the best moments in the series. The cinematography is absolutely great, the lighting was brilliant and the action is very intense, but some of it should have been saved for the ending. The first hour is amazing, but the second hour doesn't really surpass what we've seen in the first, and it shouldn't be that way. The first two Mission films peaked with excitement with their finales; with the train sequence in the first and that awesome motorcycle chase and fist fight in the second, and the film tries a little too hard to play it safe in the end, it would have been better if they had just allowed it to take a few more risks, but it chickens out. I would recommend checking out M:I:III if you liked parts one and two, and finishing up at just a little over two hours long, is very well paced and NEVER has a dull moment, and make sure to expect the impossible. This is one of the best action films of the year, and it's sure to push your adrenaline levels to the max. So pop some popcorn, turn off the lights, crank up the surround sound and have some fun!",6,7,12,5 November 2006
United 93," The last 15 minutes will leave you speechless
","There are two reasons why people go to the movies. They either go to be amused, entertained or distracted from the pressures of the real world; it's called escapism. The other is to learn, experience, educate, inform and face what our world is all about. Films like Schindler's List, Black Hawk Down, Saving Private Ryan, All the President's Men, and this week another film joins that list; Paul Greengrass' visceral and heartbreaking United 93. Some say it's too soon for a film about 9/11 to come out, but I disagree. I think this film is a bold and important reminder of why we're still fighting to this very day, and it puts us up close and personal with our very enemy; face to face. I don't think I've had such a profound and sober movie going experience like this since I saw The Passion of the Christ, and when the film was over how did the audience react? Applause.United 93 is shot entirely with hand-held cameras to perfectly capture the realism of the events that happened that day. The film was written and directed by British filmmaker Paul Greengrass, who's previous films include 2004's blockbuster hit The Bourne Supremacy and the critically acclaimed 2002 docu-drama Bloody Sunday, and every frame of his vision is unflinching, intense and heart pounding from it's quiet beginning to it's nerve-wracking and stomach turning finale. The film is never exploitive of the events of 9/11 and always remains respectful to the memories of those on board that fateful plane.Everybody knows the story, and everybody knows how it's going to end, but that never stops the film from being suspenseful. The film is pretty much void of any character development, and the film never, not even for a second feels like a movie, it looks like a documentary. And I'm sure the way Greengrass has captured the shock, confusion, chaos and panic of that morning is how it must have gone down. The cameras cover the action from all perspectives; from the National Air Traffic Control Center, airport towers, regional air traffic stations, and a military command room where soldiers try to figure out if and when they have the authority to shoot down a necessary target in order to protect Washington. One of the amazing things about United 93 is its casting. The casting of the film includes a number of real life United pilots, stewardesses, air traffic controllers and military personnel, many of them actually playing themselves. The cast of passengers are a group of largely unknowns, which lends great respectability and reality. We are seeing these people for the first time, with no previous knowledge of them as actors and it only works in their favor.The film opens quietly with several hijackers going through their morning rituals, reading aloud from the Koran; praying to God and kneeling on the floor of their hotel room and then packing their things to head to the Newark airport. And from there we are introduced to several different air traffic controller technicians and we watch as they discover that two planes have been hi-jacked and eventually discover that they've hit the World Trade Center. These scenes are heartbreaking and feel somewhat surreal. But it's not until United flight 93 takes off that the towers are hit and the plane is up in the air when the terrorist's plans are set into motion.The final fifteen minutes of United 93 will leave you speechless and paralyzed, as a group of passengers plan to attack and over throw the terrorists and try to take back the cockpit. It's intense, violent and overwhelmingly inspiring. The film is a well done memorial, dedicated to those who were killed on September 11th, and I truly believe that the film was done with the utmost respect to those involved and with amazing passion and sensitivity to 'get it right'. Director Paul Greengrass does get it right, and I honestly believe that it would have been impossible for it to have been done any better than it is here. United 93 is absolutely amazing, and to see a better or more important film this year seems very unlikely, and I think this film should be required viewing for all Americans, but when they feel that they are ready for it, because this is as real as it gets. This film is responsible film-making of the highest level and the experience is both sobering and cathartic.",10,297,414,28 April 2006
Bloody Sunday," Sunday, Bloody Sunday
","Bloody Sunday is a gritty and emotionally intense documentary style drama about an Irish civil rights protest march in that ended in a violent massacre when British troops opened fire on the crowd of protesters on January 30, 1972 in Darry, Northern Ireland. The film was written and directed by British filmmaker Paul Greengrass with a steady hand and an unflinching eye for human emotion much like this year's United 93. Greengrass is quickly becoming one of my favorite filmmakers with his passionate and intimate look at dramatic history.The film starts off the night before the protest with Civil Rights leader Ivan Cooper (played well by James Nesbitt) announcing to the press that they will march peacefully the next day and that they will continue to march for Civil Rights until they get what they want. From then on the film shows Cooper rallying the town's people together, passing out pamphlets for their peaceful march, and we see British troops setting up roadblocks and barricades. The march gets going and as it makes it way through the town all seems to be going according to plan, but things start to unravel when some of the town's more rebellious youth start to fear the troop's presence and start to throw bricks. The British try hitting them with a water cannon, but the situation escalates into a shooting frenzy as the troops think someone in the crowd starts to fire at them. The troops move in quickly and suddenly laying down fire shooting retreating protesters left and right without pause or mercy. These scenes of mass hysteria and panic are both saddening and tragic.At the end of Bloody Sunday thirteen protesters are dead and many of the young male surviving protesters joined the IRA in retaliation of the British government's actions, only causing the effectiveness of the Civil Rights movement's cause to become tragically lost. The film does a very effective job of recreating history in a convincing and gripping way. You don't have to really know anything about the Historical aspect of the film to really understand the film, but it certainly doesn't hurt. This is a powerfully effective film with a fiery tension and sad conclusion. If you liked United 93, Munich or Black Hawk Down I think you might enjoy Bloody Sunday. And as it should, the film ends with a live performance of U2's 'Sunday, Bloody Sunday'.",10,3,8,29 April 2006
X-Men," X-Men is X-cellent!
","When I look back at the summer of 2000 there's really only two films that come to mind; Ridley Scott's Gladiator (which I loved), and Bryan Singer's X-Men. Which in my opinion, was the best comic book movie adaptation (at least at that time), even beating out Batman for the top spot. X-Men seemed to deliver just the right amount of big-scale action, humor and sci-fi imaginings that made the film accessible to anyone, whether they were die-hard comic book fans, or not. And at that particular time, I was not, but now I am a huge comic book fan.When I was really young (around four or five) I used to be into Superman and Batman, so I was more of the D.C. Comics type of kid. I watched those old 40's Max & Dave Fleischer Superman cartoons, the George Reeves 50's black and white Superman TV show, and of course the Christopher Reeves films, and both the Batman and Superman animated TV series of the early-mid 90's (which I still love), heck I even watched the 60's Batman TV show with Adam West (remember back before he was the Mayor of Quahog?). I didn't really get into Batman until Tim Burton came out with his film in '89. But despite all of these things I still wasn't a 'comic book kid'. I never went out and bought, or read comic books, but it wasn't until I saw Bryan Singer's X-Men, and to a greater extent Sam Raimi's Spider-Man that I became a real comic book fan. So for me X-Men is kind of a turning point in my interest with comic books and superheroes.X-Men has a number of things working for it. First off, the film is under a hundred minutes, and is very quick paced; never slow, or dull. Second, the casting is, well excellent. Hugh Jackman is spot-on perfect for the character of Wolverine, who was always my favorite X-Men even before I saw the film. He's a tough character whose rough around the edges, but with a tender heart, but don't mess with him, because he'll tear you a new one, literally! Then there's Professor X (for Xavier), played by none other than Patrick Stewart. Honestly though, could you even image for a second for anyone else in this role? Because I certainly know I couldn't. Then there's 'the bad guy'; Magneto, played by the great Sir Ian McKellan, needless to say he's great as well; a villain evoking both cold-blooded menace and intelligence. Then there's the rest of the cast which includes James Marsden, Famke Janssen, Halle Barry, Anna Paquin, Rebecca Romijn (insert drooling sound here), Tyler Mane and Ray Park. All of them were great, well all except Halle Barry's wig and fake accent, but other than that it's hard to see anything wrong with this cast. And I for one am glad they decided to change the costumes a bit, because Wolverine just wouldn't have looked as kick-ass as he did if he was wearing yellow spandex, like in the comic books, but I thought the X-Men looked great in the black leather costumes.The plot of X-Men, in case you've been living under a rock, or just haven't seen the movie before is about two mutants (Wolverine and Rouge) who are rescued by two X-Men (Storm and Cyclops) and brought to a 'school for the gifted' run by Professor X. It seems as if they are on the edge of a war between humans and mutants. Magneto has an evil, secret plan towell, I ain't gonna spoil it for ya, you'll just have to see the movie. But X-Men isn't just a big summer action flick, filled with computer effects, no, X-Men is also well-acted and well-written. Any 'popcorn' flick can have special effects, but not all of them deliver the solid performances and smart dialogue like X-Men does, and on top of that the film is also dark, stylish, exciting, and at times surprisingly funny. I couldn't have asked for a better comic book movie, and it still holds up after many viewings, many years later. This is excellent summer fun that's not dumbed down, and people of all ages, young and old, and both male and female alike and both fans and non-fans can enjoy.",8,0,0,18 April 2006
Zodiac," 'This is the Zodiac speaking.'
","For those who are expecting David Fincher's latest film to be another Seven, don't. Zodiac bares more in resemblance to Oliver Stone's JFK than it does to The Silence of the Lambs. Seen through the perspective of the journalists and police investigators involved in the legendary unsolved case, the film provides no solid culprit and involves very little on-screen violence. But remember this is a Fincher film, and his real talent is juicing the maximum out of what little he puts on display. The murder sequences (there are three shown here) are brutal, unflinching and cold. For the first time it feels nervously uncomfortable to be watching a film about a serial killer, especially since what we're seeing is fact, not fiction. Particularly chilling is the opening murder and the lakeside attack, while both warming up with a sly amount of playful comedy, quickly and utterly shoots to painful and realistic grim reality. There's no slow motion, no quick cut-aways, no musical score  just violence, in it's most simplest and basic form, and it sent chills down my spine.This is a crime-drama that's about as by the book as one could make, and that's both the film's strength and weakness. The film is less and less about actual character's, instead it's more focused on showing us the compulsive obsession that the case had on those who where desperately trying to stop the Zodiac. The film begins in July of '68 and ends in 1991, and if you're not prepared for it, it just might feel like it too. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Robert Graysmith (the author of the book for which the film is based on), a cartoonist for the San Francisco Chronicle and puzzle geek, who becomes obsessed with solving the case. Robert Downey Jr stars in yet another great performance (who is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors) as Roger Avery, a crime reporter for the Chronicle, who is assigned to cover the Zodiac killings, and in doing so becomes a target himself and it ultimately costs him his career (and probably his health too). Mark Ruffalo and Anthony Edwards star as two San Francisco detectives, Toschi and Armstrong, working the case of a cabbie that was executed by the Zodiac. When their investigation goes from hot leads that end up going cold, the two lose their hope of ever catching the killer, and in steps Graysmith, the puzzle geek that just can't seem to keep the Zodiac off his mind. His obsession with the case ends up costing him his marriage, but like a hunting dog, he's on the case, and comes closer to nabbing the killer than any other person.If the film hadn't been based on an actual unsolved case this would have been boring as hell and extremely anti-climatic, but fortunately that's not the case. I found myself utterly transfixed and fascinated by the case and that was enough for me to get sucked into, so much so I barely ate any of my popcorn. The way Zodiac is shot reminded me a lot of films from the 70's, like the nervous paranoia of Francis Ford Coppola's The Conversation and the 'just the facts' mentality of a serious-minded investigation similar to Alan Pakula's All the President's Men. Both solid and great films of that era, before fax machines and cell phones, an era that director David Fincher brings back to vivid life (as if it were almost yesterday) with the gloomy cinematography, which is shot in High-Definition, looks absolutely stellar, and the costumes which don't distract our attention away from the story. I loved all the references to Bullit, Dirty Harry and even the display of a little Pong action.Much like the case itself, Zodiac isn't a sprint  it's a marathon. Expect a very detailed investigative drama with suspense and intrigue sprawled out over a 160 minute running time, and considering the end result of the case, the ending feels maddening, but justifiably so. I know I'll definitely be watching this one again and again on DVD. Hell, I might even go see it again this week, just to be able to process it all. This is quite easily the most complex and mature of all of the films in Fincher's expanding career. And it's no less of challenge than his previous films, it's not quite the eerie disturbing nature of Seven or the raw brutality of Fight Club, this is mental and exhaustive brutality; which captures the frustration and anxiety of the rare and memorable unsolved case down to every clue and false lead.",10,1,5,4 March 2007
The Prestige," Nolan delivers more than just smoke and mirrors
","It's now official in my book; Christopher Nolan is the Hitchcock of the twenty-first century. His films are often dark, psychological and mysterious and always intelligent and carefully planned out; he's a real pro of both direction and misdirection. From his early film, Following, to last summer's blockbuster hit, Batman Begins, his films also usually require some intelligence and maybe even a second viewing to put all the jig-saw piece together. His latest thriller, entitled The Prestige, is a combination of the gloomy cinematography of Batman Begins and the swift and often disorienting editing of Following. Yes, it's a thinker, and yes I'm sure some will easily confuse this film with The Illusionist, but these two films couldn't be anymore different. Where as The Illusionist was a romantic-mystery set in Vienna, The Prestige is a dark mystery-thriller set in Victorian era London. This is a darker, meaner and a much more emotionally colder film about two men's obsession with fame and greatness, and to what lengths they will desperately go to get it.The Prestige is about two magicians, Rupert Angier and Alfred Bowden, played marvelously by the charismatic Hugh Jackman and the slick and crafty Christian Bale. Angier is a magician with a real talent for wooing the audience with his razzle-dazzle tricks, and Bowden is the more talented of the two, but doesn't quite know how to engage the audience with his show stopping talents. They were once partners working with a magic stage producer named Cutter (played by the great Michael Caine), but when Angier's wife is accidentally killed in a magic trick gone wrong a strong rival and bitter hatred is born. Angier holds Alfred personally responsible for the accident, and then sets out to get his revenge by up-staging his competition with more dazzling tricks or simply just steal the ones he's already using, but just adding a little more pizazz to win over the crowds and ultimately get all the glory.The rival gets more and more heated when Alfred pulls off an incredible trick that Angier just can't seem to figure out how to duplicate. To the best of his knowledge he tries to replicate the trick, but as he struggles to unravel the mystery behind it meets an obsessed scientist named Nikola Telsa (played very well by David Bowie, that's right David Bowie, how awesome was that!), who's experimenting with electricity. Remember this is the late nineteenth century, and to some that probably was a form of magic back then. As this rivalry gets more and more intense lives are shattered (along with limbs) and friendships are betrayed. The film bounces back and forth from the present time and the past (with the use of 0f flashbacks), which helps to keep the mystery masked until it's ready to be unveiled at the end. But unlike The Illusionist, this isn't a film that's solely a one-trick pony. The Prestige is twisting and turning from beginning to end, and never stops. Some things you might see coming, others you might not, but regardless, Nolan delivers the drama and the suspense to pull you into the film and carry you through it. I won't talk anymore about the film or its secrets; it's far too much fun to discover them for yourself and then talk to others who have seen it afterwards. I noticed a number of people in the theater stayed in their seats until the end credits discussing the film's ending and it's many surprises.The reason I'm not giving this film a perfect ten is because sometimes it can get a bit too confusing, but I'm sure it'll make it even more fun to go back and watch it over and over again just like Memento. Also, emotionally it was a little tough to get into fully. The characters aren't quite fully black nor white; they're a shade of gray that's constantly drifting from the light to the dark. Jackman is especially impressive because of his charismatic charm (remember how likable Wolverine was? Yeah, me too.) and to see him slip into evil is actually kind of spooky. And what can I say about Christian Bale other than the fact that he's an amazing actor. If anyone is to be the 'hero' of this tale I'd probably put my money on him. With The Prestige Christopher Nolan has given me one more reason why he's one of my favorite film directors working today, and so far his track record is flawless and his films are consistently intriguing and refreshingly original. This film is one of the smartest brain teasers of the year and I am certain The Prestige will make my top ten favorite movies of the year list. Now I can't wait for Nolan and his team to get to work on the sequel to Batman Begins; The Dark Knight. I'm sure that once again I'll be left stunned and thrilled.",10,3,6,21 October 2006
Silent Hill," 'This town is the grain, and I am the reaper.'
","Well it took many tries, and sub sequentially, many failures, but it has finally been done; a good movie-going experience based off of a video game. French filmmaker Christophe Gans and Pulp Fiction screenwriter Roger Avery have brought to the big screen a completely faithful film experience that lives up to the game's bizarre imagery and twisted reality, and surprisingly it doesn't rely heavily on fast editing and loads of CGI effects. The film is an experience; much like the Silent Hill games, you journey into the darkness and spiral down into a hellish nightmare that has you coming face to face with your worst fears, and no one can hear your screams in the town of Silent Hill.The film isn't perfect it does have a few issues that have to be overlooked in order to enjoy this movie. One of the problems is the films running time, two hours may not sound like a very long movie, but Silent Hill is a dreary, very slow-moving journey into the unknown, and much like the games, when you're not being chased or attacked by a bunch of creatures the experience is rather dull. Thankfully Gans, working along side creature make-up effects creator Patrick Tatopolos, whose previous films include Independence Day and Underworld, have really created some truly ferocious monsters that inhabit the ghostly town, adding just the right amount of freakishly scary and psychologically 'that's screwed up!' edginess to the film. Gans' never pulls any of his punches with the blood or gore either, which only made some of the scenes seem to stick in your mind a little longer after having left the theater.However when these amazing looking creatures aren't on screen is when the film seems to falter. The Silent Hill games were really about getting a spine-tingling delight out of creeping through dark, rotten and rusty corridors in near total darkness, just waiting for something evil to reach out and grab you. The movie does seem to have a problem of moving really, really slowly, but then again this is very similar to the games. Like last year's big screen adaptation of Sin City, Silent Hill also stays very close to the look, feel, style, pace and sound of the games, heck, they even went ahead and decided to use the entire soundtrack from the game throughout the film, which worked wonderfully, and the film also puts Johnny Cash's 'Ring of Fire' to amusing use. Silent Hill isn't another Tomb Raider or Resident Evil clone, it's a monster all its own. What is also strangely unique is that the majority of the cast is female (there's really only two male leads in the entire film), and the main character doesn't run around fully armed to the teeth with semi-automatics blasting away baddies and using stylish kung fu and is heavily experienced and trained in combat; she's just an average mother and for the most of the time is completely defenseless; this is a totally different ballgame all together.The plot of the film revolves around a sick little girl named Sharon DaSilva, who sleepwalks at night and constantly talks about a place called Silent Hill, which she's never been to before. Her mother, Rose is played by Radha Mitchell (you might remember her from Pitch Black or Man on Fire), and she decides to take Sharon to the town of Silent Hill, hopefully looking for answers for what's wrong with her daughter. As it turns out Silent Hill is a ghost town that has been restricted and locked away from the public, supposedly because the fires which destroyed the town and pretty much everyone in it a long time ago are still a hazard and still burn deep underneath the town. This doesn't stop Rose from trying to get Sharon to Silent Hill, but once they arrive in town strange and unexplainable things start to happen. The town is covered in a constant thick fog that showers down ashes like falling snow. Rose looses her daughter in the mysterious town and sets out on foot to find her, and along the way she meets several strange people and shes constantly attacked by various demonic creatures that are waiting around every corner. What happened to this town? Why does her daughter keep mentioning it? And what evil lurks deep within this Hell-on-Earth?This is a very different kind of video game movie; it's slow paced, confusing and visually fascinating. This horror-thriller doesn't use fast edits and quick 'jump scares' to shock audiences, instead it uses brutally dark and haunting imagery and bizarre and insane looking monsters to scary the living hell out of you. The story is just as foggy as the town itself, but much like when I was only ten-years-old and used to watch episodes of ER, even though I didn't fully understand exactly what was going on at any given moment, I did however, get the jest of it, and to one degree or another did understand it, just not completely. The film's ending might leave some people scratching their heads but if you've played the games you'll know that this is really just a set up for a possible sequel. Silent Hill is an interesting, but certainly flawed film, and it's a uniquely disturbing trip into a maddening darkness that I can't quite remember the last time I experienced something quite like it in the theaters, and that's why I'm recommending you check out the film, especially if you're not only a fan of the games, but also a fan of real horror movies that aren't filled with stupid teenagers and slapped with a weak PG-13 rating that seem to be a dime a dozen these days; Silent Hill is a rarity.",6,1,3,24 April 2006
Pan's Labyrinth," Del Toro's Masterpiece
","For me, the great thing about the winter  besides Christmas  is that this is the time of year when we finally get to see some of the very best films. In October we got The Departed and The Prestige. In November we got Babel, Stranger than Fiction and The Fountain. And this December we got Apocalypto, Children of Men and this film; Guillermo Del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth, which is yet again, another great film, and in my opinion one of my favorite films of the year. I know I've been saying that a lot this time of year, but it's so true. This is the last great film to what I have considered to be a relatively good year for movies. This year's Oscars are going to a very close race, and as I see it Pan's Labyrinth has already won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film of the Year. I shall accept nothing less; my mind is already made up.In this dark, unique picture; part war-time drama and part horror/fantasy, set in 1944, during a Civil War in Northern Spain, it tells a story about a 12-year-old girl, Ofelia (played wonderfully by the young Ivana Baquero), who moves with her pregnant mother and new stepfather into a new home in the countryside. Her stepfather is Captain Vidal, played with a truly evil presence by Sergi Lopez, has been sent to this remote area to rid it of a small Republican militia. Disliked by the sadistic Vidal (who might as well be Hitler himself), Ofelia buries herself in fairy tales, and discovers an immense and ancient labyrinth guarded by a faun named Pan. He tells her that she is the long-lost daughter of the king of a magical underworld, and to regain entry to her kingdom she must carry out three tasks. So Ofelia enters a strange and no less dangerous world of fairies and extraordinary creatures to complete her tasks.Director Guillermo Del Toro, whose largely known for such popcorn movies as Mimic, Blade II and 2004's underrated comic book smash-up Hellboy, is at the top of his game and taking a step forward; growing as a filmmaker. The film is both visually imaginative and brutally violent, and sometimes it's not always easy to watch, but Del Toro mezmerizes you so much you can't look away, even when you'd like to. This is a fantasy film where you don't just go to admire the visuals and fantastical elements that are on display, it's also a deeply emotional and sad film with real flesh and blood characters. At the heart of the film is a great performance from Spanish born actress Ivana Baquero, who I think delivers one of the best performances from anyone her age. This Labyrinth most certainly isn't a film for children. Pan's Labyrinth is rated a strong R for graphic violence, and is in Spanish with English subtitles (don't be a pussy, you can do it!). And for it's entire two hour running time I was instantly swept away with Del Toro's uncompromised vision seen through the eyes of an innocent child and I was left heart broken by it's tragic finale, and it moved me to tears. This is one of the best films of the year, and for filmmaker Guillermo Del Toro it is without doubt the finest film of his career. A true masterpiece. I was left stunned and utterly speechless.",10,2,4,12 January 2007
Full Metal Jacket," A Masterpiece? No, but it has it's moments
","Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket is, to many people, regarded as being a 'masterpiece' or a 'classic'. What I believe is that it's overrated. It's an okay film overall, but it shows us nothing new about the Vietnam war that we haven't already seen in Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now or Oliver Stone's Platoon. The only thing new or memorable about Full Metal Jacket is R. Lee Ermey's unforgettable performance as a foul-mouthed, tough-as-nails drill sergeant. That's the one thing people will always remember about Full Metal Jacket. The opening scenes in boot camp are pretty interesting, but once the film actually gets to the war it isn't as memorable, or as great as other films have certainly captured the Vietnam war. It has a few moments where it touches greatness, but as a whole the film suffers quite a bit.Another problem with Full Metal Jacket is the lack of interesting or decent characters. I didn't particularly like any of the soldiers in this film, which is a first. None of them are really worth cheering for. And when we get towards the end and they're getting killed off it's hard to have any real sympathy for them. The desired emotion Kubrick wants is for us to care, and to feel sad for them dying and getting shot up, but I sit there, emotionless, not caring. This is to war films, what a comedy is that doesn't make you laugh pretty much pointless. The good war films, the memorable war films allow you to sympathize with the soldiers getting killed, Apocalypse Now, Platoon, Saving Private Ryan, Black Hawk Down and even the recent Jarhead can accomplish this, but sadly Kubrick's film does not. Then again maybe that's what Kubrick intended for all along, but if so why?I think Full Metal Jacket, as a war film is okay, but I don't see what many people hail as being brilliant about it. It follows a pretty familiar path that many Vietnam films have followed before, and doesn't show us much that we haven't already seen. The stuff in the beginning with Leonard(played by Vincent D'Onofrio), a private whose tormented and driven psychotic is still quite haunting and memorable, but again, the beginning are the only truly captivating moments of this film. Full Metal Jacket adds to the war genre, but doesn't improve upon it, at least that's what I think.",10,0,1,25 January 2006
The Hills Have Eyes," The most intense horror film in years
","Yes sire, we have a winner here folks! The Hills Have Eyes is the best horror remake since 2004's Dawn of the Dead, and I doubt you'll see a better horror flick all year long. It's brutal, gory and insanely intense; a really well done, fleshed out nightmare, that pulls no punches and takes no prisoners. The movie is a remake of a Wes Craven film from the 70's about a family driving through the New Mexico desert on a cross country road trip when their truck is wrecked and they are left stranded in the middle of nowhere. Their cell phones are out of range to pick up any signals, and their truck is smashed up beyond any kind of repair. Their options are limited, and none of them are good. As it turns out the part of the desert they happen to be in was once a nuclear testing ground used by the government. A group of miners were ordered to leave their homes and seek refugee from the nuclear fallout, but they didn't leave, and in turn were left deformed, mutated and extremely deranged.I've always found that the best horror films are the ones that really allow you to care and sympathize with the characters, because being able to put your heart into the characters really is what keeps you on the edge of your seat, and most horror movies do a poor or terrible job at doing that. It's only once you're emotionally invested in the people that you can really root for them and hope that they all make it out alive in the end. If not, then your just watching people who you don't care for getting endlessly slaughtered, and it's not engaging or interesting as a movie going experience. The Hills Have Eyes does manage to do this, and does it quite well. We spend the first twenty or thirty minutes learning about this seemingly average American family on what would seem like a completely normal road trip. I was actually quite surprised at how much time the film burns just allowing us to grow closer to this family before plunging them head first into a hellishly intense nightmare in the middle of nowhere. Once we've become attached to these characters it hurts us to see them in such jeopardy or even killed off, but that's the reality of the film; it's survival of the fittest in the grittiest of ways.The first scene in which the family is terrorized by the mutants from the hills is quite a tremendously disturbing scene. So much so that I did notice several people get up and walkout, so this movie clearly isn't for everyone. The scene in which two of the mutants torment the women of the family in the trailer is pretty sick, and is made only more horrifying because there's also a little baby, whose life is also in jeopardy. It's a risky scene, very real, but also very risky. Once the sequence is over you're left shocked, repulsed and immediately you hate these mutants, and you can't wait until these guys get it in the end. The mutants in the film are monstrously primitive and relentless, and it helps that they're also cannibals, which puts them over the top on the creepy scale.You watch this normal average everyday American family being victimized and tormented and then there's the aftermath; what are they gonna do about it? The mutants have killed members of their family (including one of their dogs) and have kidnapped their baby. From this point on the entire film is in straight up smackdown, in-your-face horror splatter mode, with plenty of nasty gore, slow, but gradual building suspense and a wickedly vicious score filled with raging guitars. The remaining members of this poor family aren't just gonna sit back and let themselves be terrorized again; they take action, holding down the fort (which in this case is the family trailer), and go after these freaks, kicking ass and taking names. Heck, even the family's dog kicks a little mutant ass! At that point you'll be screaming 'Hell yeah!' The Hills Have Eyes is an intense horror film; shocking, horrifying, gory, and unpredictable. It just might be too much for some people, but for hardcore horror fans, THIS is the film you've been waiting for, and it certainly delivers the goods! It's an unapologetic exercise in visceral horror, so raw it just might fry your nerves.",7,0,0,16 May 2006
Little Miss Sunshine," The best comedy of the year!
","When I first saw the trailer for Little Miss Sunshine in front of Thank You for Smoking I thought to myself 'Awww that looks like cornball hell'. But to my surprise an enormous amount of absolutely glowing reviews came pouring in praising the film. This time you can trust the critics. Little Miss Sunshine is not only the most hysterically funny and original comedy of the year, it's also one of the very best and most delightful films I've seen all year long. That's right, it truly is. This innocence and carefree little flick serves up a great dish of bittersweet drama and plenty of quirky laughs. If the Academy Awards have any real value left to them this film would at the very least get a Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay; its proof that movies can still be funny and original without having to rely entirely on potty humor and tasteless sex jokes. This is one of those underrated films that should get more attention, and hopefully more people will go and check it out.This dramedy about a super dysfunctional family revolves around one little girl named Olive; an innocence oddball child with aspirations to win a beauty pageant named 'Little Miss Sunshine'. One look at her and you think to yourself, 'Well that ain't happenin' anytime soon.' Abigail Breslin (the little girl from Signs) is outstanding as Olive, and her performance is a real winner for such a young actress (Look out Dakota!), but this film isn't necessarily all about one great performance, instead we get six! Toni Collette and Greg Kinnear play Sheryl and Richard, the mother and father of this gang of misfits, which includes not only Olive, but her older brother Dwayne, who aspires to be a pilot and has taken a vow of silence until he achieves his goal. And then there's Frank, Olive's gay and suicidal uncle, played by funnyman Steve Carell. Carell, whose ability to whip up laughs in last year's The 40-Year-Old Virgin, keeps himself in a constant downtrodden mood and never seems to try too hard to get laughs, but he gets 'em anyway. He could have stolen the spotlight easily, but he doesn't. And rounding out the family is Alan Arkin as the grumpy and horny grandpa named, well honestly, it's just 'Grandpa'. Whose complains about getting old and snorts heroine to deal with his life. All the performances are equally great, no one really seems to outshine anybody else; much like a real family they work together and together they make one of the most entertainingly fun and enjoyable dysfunctional families I've seen on the big screen in quite a long time.The majority of the film is the family packing into their busted up and literally falling apart VW minivan and traveling hundreds of miles to get Olive to the pageant on time. Sounds like a simple premise, but to anyone whose seen a road trip comedy you can bet that the journey will take plenty of hilarious detours, and the best part of Little Miss Sunshine is that most of the detours you won't see comin'; when you think you know exactly where the joke is headed it immediately takes a sharp turn and goes somewhere else entirely. The amazing script by first time writer, Michael Arndt, is full of tender and soft moments, but the film never gets sappy or corny, and instead sometimes stings with quirky humor and very deep insights into the joy of life, family, and the misery of the pressure to win and the bitter taste of losing. The great thing about the film is how it's handled and how perfectly balanced it is; it never becomes predictably trite or overly sentimental.Little Miss Sunshine is a delightful little surprise that rides a roller coaster of emotions from sad, to heat-warming to hysterically funny and enjoyable. This isn't exactly a 'family movie'. It's rated a mild R, for some language and sexual humor and brief drug use. But this is such a charming and entertaining film you hardly seem to notice the R rating. So if you're looking for something refreshingly original and equally funny and enjoyable and you're sick of shallow entertainment like Snakes on a Plane or Beerfest and looking for something that'll put a nice big 'ol smile on your face I'd highly recommend rushing out to the theater and seeing Little Miss Sunshine, even if you have to give your car a push start to make it to the theater, it's worth it.",9,1,4,4 September 2006
Apocalypse Now," 'I love the smell of napalm in the morning.'
","Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now is an absolute masterpiece. It doesn't really matter which version of the film you watch; the original '79 version, or the restored and extended 'Redux' cut. Francis Ford Coppola has said that he personally prefers the longer cut of the film which was finally restored in 2001 and added an additional fifty minutes of footage cut from the original release because of it's already long running time of two and a half hours. When I first saw Apocalypse Now I watched the original version and I was instantly taken by it. It was dark, twisted, and surreal and unlike any other war film I had seen before. A few years later I watched the 2001 'Redux' version and was a bit disappointed with it initially. The extra fifty minutes didn't really seem to add much more substance to the overall picture and in return just ended up slowing down the film so much that it just dragged on. Since that time I have only watched the original cut of the film on DVD and still love it. It's one of my all-time favorite war films and probably the best Vietnam war film I've ever seen, and if it's not the best, because certainly Oliver Stone's Platoon is another Vietnam war film that I hold in very high regard, but if Apocalypse Now isn't the best film on Vietnam it's certainly the most original, darkest and fascinating.The film uses Joseph Conrad's novel 'Heart of Darkness' as the basis for the plot, but setting it in the middle of the Vietnam War. Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen) leads a top secret classified mission to travel by boat up a long and dangerous river into Cambodia to assassinate a rouge Green Beret officer named Colonel Kurtz, played with a powerfully absorbing intensity by Marlon Brando. Kurtz seems to have gone completely and totally insane, and a local jungle tribe seems to have adopted him and worship him as some kind of God. Along the perilous journey the team encounters many strange and unusual people and places, including a gung-ho Lieutenant Colonel of the Air Calvary named Bill Kilgore, played great by a wild and fun Robert Duvall (in an Oscar nominated performance), that leads an all-out assault on a small village of Vietnamese, which is undoubtedly the most infamous sequence in the film. But that's just the beginning of this bizarre odyssey; as the small group of soldiers makes their way up the river they also meet some Playboy Playmates, and come across a nighttime battle over a destroyed bridge that is nothing but absolute anarchy and chaos, with no one seemingly in control of the combat. And just wait until Captain Willard finally gets to meet Colonel Kurtz, face to face; it's well worth the wait. Oh, and the scene where the cow gets sacrificed, that wasn't faked; that was all done for real.Apocalypse Now is a wild and nightmarish vision of hell on Earth. Francis Ford Coppola's vision of the Vietnam War is so strange and surreal it might as well take place on an entirely different planet all together. The performances are all superb, not a single weak link among them. Among my favorites though has to be Dennis Hopper as an American photojournalist with a motor-mouth and always seems to be on the brink of madness. The Oscar-winning cinematography by Vittorio Storaro is phenomenal, and crisp with bolder darks and beautifully bright colors that look even better on the new DVD transfer. It looks so good it's actually hard to believe that the film is nearly thirty years old. And the action sequences are just another aspect of the film that seems to hold up amazingly well over the years. The helicopter attack sequence is breathtaking and still impressive, even by today's standards. The music of Apocalypse Now is another pretty interesting topic. It's mostly an orchestral score done with synthesizers and a few rock tunes from The Rolling Stones ('I can't get no satisfaction') and The Doors ('The End') and Robert Wagner's classical march 'The Ride of the Valkyries', which is a piece of music that has become infamous with the film.I recently re-watched the 'Redux' cut of Apocalypse Now and must say that I did enjoy it more a second time around. Some scenes, while still feeling long and maybe a bit excessive, don't really feel as uninteresting or unimportant anymore. The additional sequence with the Playmates does still seem to be pretty pointless to me, but the scene with the French plantation now seems to have more of a purpose; of reminding Willard of man's potential for both good and evil. This scene used to seem slow and pointless, now it seems to make a little more sense when you think more about the ending and how important choices of good and evil play out. The extra fifty minutes of restored footage in the 'Redux' cut seems to add a lot more character development and a little more comradeship to the soldiers, but also it makes the journey up the river longer and more 'tiring', but in a good way. Personally I like both versions of the film, but choosing which one to watch really depends on what kind of film you're in the mood for. The original cut is more straightforward and to the point. Apocalypse Now Redux is a little more taxing to sit through (running at three hours and twenty two minutes), but has more substance, nudity and truly carries the weight of a dangerous and surreal journey into the heart of darkness. But which ever version you chose to watch, either way it's a masterpiece.",10,2,2,16 August 2006
Spider-Man," Spider-Man learns to crawl, but only later does he learn to fly!
","Sam Raimi's Spider-Man is full of energy, zipping and zooming across the screen with gleefully wild delight. The former Evil Dead creator's visual style for quick zooms and he's zany sense of humor is present throughout the film, but Raimi has also brought along his heart and passion for the comic book to his film. The film was written by David Keopp, fresh after writing David Fincher's Panic Room, and his script gets a few things right and a few things not so right, but in the end this is a pretty amusing and exciting sci-fi/adventure that's sure to keep you entertained.The cast of Spider-Man does a quite a good job, but I'll be honest when I first heard that Toby Maguire was going to be playing the role of Spider-Man I thought to myself, 'Who? That nerdy kid from Pleasantville?', so obviously I had my doubts as to if he was up to the task of pulling off the part of Peter Parker and Spider-Man. Why Maguire is perfectly suited for the role of Spider-Man is because he can easily pull of the nerdy/boy-next-door look that is required for Peter Parker. Another good job in casting was getting Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn aka 'The Green Goblin'. Dafoe goes all Nicholson on us, and doesn't hold anything back; he's in full-on snarl and growl mode, and his voice and mannerisms fit well with the character he's playing. I particularly enjoyed the scene where he talks to himself in the mirror, showing his multiple personalities, a scene that's gone somewhat similar in Peter Jackson's The Two Towers.The special effects on the other hand aren't quite as flawless as the casting, but for the majority of the film they do work to one degree or another. In the scene where Parker discovers his powers and jumps along the roof tops it's pretty obvious that's a computer effect, but watching Spider-Man battle the Green Goblin on the Queensboro Bridge in the film's finale is quite something. The shots that seemed to take my breath away the most were the dramatic shots of Spider-Man swinging his way all around Manhattan and the cinematography by Don Burgess really helps add to the vibrant look of the film, which is very cool.However, there are a few little things and one big thing I didn't like about Spider-Man. First off, the little things. Personally I think Mary Jane looked a little 'skanky' in the beginning of the movie. Was I the only one that thought that? Secondly, I wasn't surprised that Peter Parker lived with his Aunt and Uncle, but it certainly would have been nice to know exactly why that was. Then there's the overindulgent Macy Gray cameo that was completely pointless. And lastly, and most importantly I really didn't like how they decided to do the Green Goblin. If you've read the comic book series Ultimate Spider-Man by Brian Michael Bendis the Green Goblin was created by Norman Osborn injecting himself with a green plasma in a syringe, and then psychically and literally turning into a green monster, which looked much more menacing than the space suite and helmet they ended up using the film. I thought that was a really, really bad choice, because of two reasons. One, it seemed a little strange that the Military would actual end up wearing a goofy looking helmet like that, and two, it just wasn't dark enough for me. But put aside those few complaints I think the film is still pretty good, but it could have been a little better. As for right now I'm giving this film a score of a seven, it's a pretty good film, with a good cast and some fun action sequences that's also able to get us involved with the characters and enjoy them on a small emotional level, so for those reasons it is a success, but it certainly could have used a little tweaking here and there.",9,1,2,18 April 2006
Jarhead," 'This is Vietnam music. Can't we even get our own f***ing music?'
","Jarhead isn't your typical combat action-war film. In fact it's probably the most unconventional war drama out there. There are no scenes of action, combat, or firefights, and you'd think that that would make Jarhead a boring and uninteresting war film. Well the answer is strangely No. Jarhead does have a moment or two where boredom settles in briefly, but the film is never really uninteresting. The film is based on the book, of the same title, written by former Marine Anthony Swofford (played here by Jake Gyllenhaal). Anthony enlists in the Marines hoping to make something out of himself. He goes through basic training; where he practices and becomes a top ranking sniper. He develops a 'taste' for what they call the 'pink mist', that's a head shot, or kill shot for those of you who were wondering.Once he and his platoon are finished with Basic they're shipped off to Saudi Arabia where they wait for action and then they wait some more, and then some more. The lack of action and the soldier's lust to 'get some' is eating them up inside. They're bored, and they've been highly and thoroughly trained for combat, but the waiting game is killing them. The war is being mostly fought and won by the 'zoomies' (that's what the Marines call fighter jets). The soldier's are not only suffering from boredom, but also from sexual frustration. They all wonder if their girlfriends are cheating on them, or will dump them. They seem to have very little belief that they'll remain faithful to them while they're away at war, and a couple of them aren't, as can clearly be seen in one particularly shocking scene. There's also another pretty shocking nightmare scene that puts the Nirvana song Something in the Way to great use.Jarhead is less about fighting a war, and more about a soldier's mental state while at war, especially when dealing with the itching nerve to want to be in the middle of combat putting your skills to the test. It can drive some men mad. Jarhead isn't about politics, it's about men, not exactly soldiers (they're men first, soldiers second). The first half of Jarhead is almost a comedy, with a number of goofy moments and dark humor. Then the film slides into the surreal as men are riding on the edge of battle. The scenes with the burning oil fields is darkly haunting and at the same time beautiful. Jarhead isn't Black Hawk Down, it isn't a film about diving into chaos and rescuing your buddy, it's about the way men are in the places and situations of war. The film delivers a number of strong performances from good actors surrounding Gyllenhaal, like Jamie Foxx as Staff Sgt. Sykes (he plays his role very realistically and funny) and Peter Sarsgaard as Troy, Swofford's closest friend.Director Sam Mendes (American Beauty and Road to Perdition) has created the first real war film that fully immerses the viewer in what it's really like to be a soldier, but surprisingly without any combat, and somehow it still succeeds. I should also mention the film's score by Thomas Newman, like all of his scores, is absolutely sensational, and really helps set the tone and rhythm. The film's unrestrained, unflinching look at male soldiers is strangely unique and fascinating. Most war films have a particular message to tell you, in Saving Private Ryan it was the shocking brutality of war, and in Black Hawk Down it was what drives men to go into dangerous, chaotic situations, but in Jarhead I'm not so sure there's a message to learn. Jarhead is more like real life, it's pointless, and it's more of an experience and a state of mind than a lesson. It's a story about men in uniform, and the uniform doesn't change anything, they're still a man underneath. If Mendes has said anything in Jarhead it's 'once a solider, always a solider'. You take those experiences with you, and no matter what you do with the rest of your life you'll always be a soldier. The main thing I said to myself after watching Jarhead was, 'Well, that was surprisingly different... and good.' And sometimes different is all a film really needs to be in order to work, and Jarhead works. This is one of my favorite films of the year, and one of my favorite war films, right along side Saving Private Ryan and Black Hawk Down.",9,0,1,25 January 2006
The Usual Suspects," The greatest trick Bryan Singer ever pulled off was this film
","In 1995 the Oscar for Best Picture went to Mel Gibson's Braveheart. I thought it should have gone to Ron Howard's Apollo 13, but the REAL film that should have won wasn't even nominated; Bryan Singer's The Usual Suspects, which was nominated for only two Academy Awards (best supporting actor and best original screenplay), which it both won. Here we have a fast paced, confusing 'hall-of-mirrors' crime-noir/thriller that's loaded with great performances from an ensemble cast, a great score and a whooping of a twist ending that's quite literally jaw-dropping. This is a film that's truly memorable and deserves to be a classic.The film starts off with what looks like five random criminals being brought in because of a bogus truck robbery. The five men then plan to get back at the cops by uncovering a corrupt service the police were providing to certain high-paying criminals. These five 'usual suspects' grow closer to one another, coming together to pull off another job in L.A. which is where things start to get sticky. They end up getting involved with a sinister crime lord that no one seems to have ever seen or met, named Keyser Soze. Is Keyser real or is he just a figment of someone's imagination? The more the jig-saw puzzle pieces seem to be coming together, the more the whole puzzle starts to change and fall apart.You'll think you're on top of it all, but eventually the rug will be pulled out from beneath your feet. The film does an excellent job of playing with your mind, and at the same time convincing you that you think you know what's going on, but it's not until the final ten minutes that you'll start to be able to pull back and look at the big picture and realize that you've been had. My hats off to director Bryan Singer (who later went on to bigger fame with 2000's X-Men) and writer Christopher McQuarrie for keeping all of this not only surprising, but fun, and exciting, without ever becoming too complicated or too confusing. But a lot of praise should also go to the fine cast as well, including Stephen Baldwin, Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Pollak, Chazz Palminteri, Benicio Del Toro, Pete Postlethwaite and a really knockout performance from Kevin Spacey, which earned him an Oscar for the role of Verbal.If you haven't already seen The Usual Suspects by now I highly recommend you go out and buy the special edition DVD right now, don't think about renting it, you'll just end up buying it later any way. It's a complicated, well crafted and nearly flawlessly written thriller that's exciting and puzzling to watch the first time, and fun to watch again and again. This is one of my top ten favorite films of the nineties, and one of my all-time personal favorites as well.",7,0,1,17 April 2006
Ghost Rider," Tired Hollywood formula causes Rider to wipeout
","It's official! Mark Steven Johnson is the new Joel Schumacher. It took Schumacher two movies to bring the Batman franchise to its knees, and with only two movies, Johnson has already buried two comic book franchises with 2003's Daredevil and this month's Ghost Rider, which arrives in theaters dead-on-arrival; flat-lined, from it's hokey beginning to it's clichéd video game ending.Nicolas Cage stars as Johnny Blaze, a famous Evil Knievel-esquire stunt performer that sold his soul to Mephistopheles (or Mephisto for short), played by Peter Fonda, in order to save his dying father, stricken with cancer. In a moment of young, naïve, foolishness he signed, with his own blood no less, a life contract to become the devil's bounty hunter; damned to hunt down fallen angels cast out of heaven.During the day Johnny is normal, but at night, in the presence of evil Johnny's skin burns off and his skull lights aflame with hellfire. His motorcycle transforms into a speed demon able to travel fast enough to melt parking meters and vertically climb up sky scrapers, and in its wake, leaves behind a fiery trail of destruction.The idea sounds kind of, well cool, actually. Unfortunately the studio  in an attempt to cash in on the Marvel product  limited the film to a PG-13 rating in order to reel in a wider audience:10 and 12-year-old boys, which was a terrible, terrible move.Instead of a fun and wildly entertaining ride, what we got is one of the worst comic book adaptations to crash land in theaters since Batman & Robin and Catwoman. Yes, it really is THAT bad.Instead of cranking out another soft and wimpy flick about demons, hell and tortured souls straight from the formulaic, cardboard factory of clichés, what we should have gotten was a fun, dark, R-rated blast more along the lines of Blade or The Crow, heck, even Spawn had more bite and attitude! It seems like Johnson isn't even passionate or interested in telling his own story, and it shows.The heavily forced and completely uninteresting romance between Johnny Blaze and his long-time love, Roxanne Simpson (played by Eva Mendes) has but not a spark of chemistry. Mendes is given little to do, and does little more than stand around and look pretty as the 'damsel in distress', whose only real talent is an impressive bust-line.Nicolas Cage  who is an expressed fan of the Ghost Rider comics  is one of the film's biggest flaws; completely miscast as the macho avenger. Cage is a talented actor when working with the right material (see his performances in the underrated Bringing out the Dead and Matchstick Men), but at the age of 43 (pretending to be 28), and his James Stewart persona of acting just isn't what this particular film calls for.What it needed was an actor with a hard edge and some grit, someone with the kind of tough-guy presence, like a young Clint Eastwood. Thomas Jane might have made a nice Ghost Rider, and I'm sure if someone like Robert Rodriguez had been working behind the camera we would have gotten that fun, R-rated ride that we should have had to begin with.The film tries to do many things, and succeeds at nothing. It tries to be humorous, but nothing is funny. The scene in which Johnny tries to explain his night-time dark side to his girlfriend aims to be funny, but all I could think about was the scene in Batman, where Michael Keaton compares his superhero gig as being just another job to Kim Basinger.Ghost Rider also tries to be scary, but nothing comes close to being frightening, and in the end, after all its constant failures, amounts to little more than boredom. Normally I don't do it, but I was tempted to walk out.Throughout the film Johnny Blaze talks about deserving a second chance, in order to turn things around, for the better. Cage is an actor who deserves a second chance, especially coming off last year's 'it's so bad, it's good' remake of The Wicker Man. As for writer/director Mark Steven Johnson, he's had his second chance. This whole comic book movie thing just isn't your game, kid.",2,34,71,17 February 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," Oh, c'mon! You know there's gonna be another one!
","After three years since Bryan Singer wowed audiences with X2: X-Men United the X-Men are finally back again on the big screen, but sadly without Singer. Nope, he's gone on to resurrect 'The Man of Steel' in Superman Returns, which will be unleashed on theaters this June. Filling in for Singer on The Last Stand is Brett Ratner, whose previous films include both Rush Hour movies, The Family Man and Red Dragon. I was skeptical about Ratner being able to live up to the intensity of Singer's films, but I found myself pleasantly surprised when all was said and done. X-Men: The Last Stand looks a lot like the first two films, but with a rock'em and sock'em energy of the 90's X-Men cartoon, and that's not really such a bad thing.The Last Stand is by and large the biggest, loudest and best piece of action to hit theaters this year, just beating out M:I:III, largely due to the film's exciting climatic finale. This episode in the series claims to be the last, but believe me, when a second sequel rakes in over a hundred and twenty million dollars at the box office in it's opening weekend, you can bet there will be at least another entry in the series. This time the X-Men face possible extermination when a possible 'cure' for the mutant 'problem' is discovered in a young mutant boy, who is now locked up in a laboratory on Alcatraz Island. Meanwhile Magneto, joined by his new ally, Pyro, try to rally a bunch of mutants to fight back and wipeout the discovered cure. Professor X feels a disturbance in the force and tells Storm and Wolverine to venture up to Alkaline Lake (where the last film ended), where they discover an unconscious Jean Grey. Apparently Jean was able to survive the collapse of the dam and as it turns out there's a dark and powerful force inside Jean's mind that is more destructive than any other mutant on the planet, and it's only a matter of time before her fury, known as 'The Phoenix', is unleashed upon the world. Dunt, dunt, duh! All the mutants that weve come to love (and hate) are back, including Professor X, Wolverine, Magneto, Cyclops, Storm, Rouge, Pryo, Mystique and Iceman, but they aren't alone, there's a ton of new mutants that fill the screen during The Last Stand, and the X-Men have a few new recruits including Colossus, Kitty Pryde and Henry McCoy aka 'Beast' or as Wolverine calls him, 'Fuzzball', played well by a blue and hairy Kelsey Grammar. With all the additional mutants I must say I'm still disappointed that Gambit didn't make it into the picture, but by piling a ton of new mutants into the film is allows for some pretty fun and wildly inventive action sequences, which the film is littered with and in top form from beginning to end. And they finally show us the 'Danger Room'. It's about time, isn't it? Where does X3 stand in terms of the trilogy? Well, it isn't quite as well structured as the first two films, but The Last Stand is by far the most ambitious of the three, so some of it's short comings can be forgiven for trying, and for the most part succeeding, at doing something wider and crazier than the first two films. Just watch the Golden Gate Bridge sequence or the intense final battle at Alcatraz and try and tell me that that wasn't as intense or was less exciting than the climax of X2. The film certainly lives up the first two films, and in some ways even manages to surpass them. X-Men: The Last Stand is the best piece of summer entertainment so far this year and with a Superman and some more Pirates on the way, things are lookin' pretty good! And if this is in fact the last film in the series, although I seriously doubt it, at least it went out with a bang. Stay through the end credits to see an extra scene that'll leave you scratching your head and going 'What the...?'",6,0,0,30 May 2006
The Illusionist," Mysteriously lacking movie magic
","The Illusionist isn't the worst film I've seen all year, but it certainly is the frontrunner for being the most boring and emotionally disconnected. Edward Norton plays Eisenheim an illusionist who has returned to Vienna to win back the love of his life, Sophie (Jessica Biel) from Crown Price Peopold, played by Rufus Sewell, in serious douchebag mode. But when the Prince learns of Eisenheim and Sophie's relationship he tries to have him locked up, with the help of Chief Inspector Uhl, played by well by the always amazing Paul Giamatti, but the powerful illusionist uses his mysterious ways to bring down the Prince and reclaim the woman of his dreams. That's pretty much the gist of what The Illusionist is all about. On paper it's an interesting and well constructed romantic mystery, but on film it sorely lacks one important component that is needed to bring all the pieces together - chemistry.The chemistry between Norton and Biel isn't present enough to build up a relationship worth investing in. Individually the performances are all fine, but the passion that connects them just isn't there. It's the kind of thing that can make or break a film like The Illusionist, and in this case the film comes off so disconnected and flat that I just wasn't hypnotized by the film's plot. I saw the film's magic, but alas I did not feel it. However the film does have some good performances (kudos to Norton for playing mysterious very well) and the sets and costumes. The film also manages to put together a pretty decent surprise ending, but looking back on it now it's seems so obvious, I actually feel rather stupid for actually falling for it.Music can have a massive impact on how a film is interpreted and experienced. Sometimes if a musical score is too prominent or overly submissive it crushes a particular scene, killing any or all drama from the performances. A lot of the times it's the horror genre that goes overboard with the musical score. The Illusionist may in fact be the first serious drama that I've seen where an abnormal lack of a dramatic score actually hurts the film as a whole; giving the film a sense of emptiness and ultimately one of boredom. I'm actually quite surprised in a lot of the highly positive reviews for this one. I think at best, The Illusionist is okay, but nothing more. Perhaps in the hands of a more experienced director like Martin Scorsese or Ridley Scott I would have been more emotionally swept away with the film's magical mischief. I say skip this and wait until Christopher Nolan unleashes The Prestige later this month. Now that's one magic trick I can't wait to take part in!",5,1,4,30 September 2006
Children of Men," An instant classic
","In Alfonso Cuarón's Children of Men we see a startling vision of a future society (2027 London) not on the brink of chaos, but already buried knee deep in it. As massive pollution, super-controlled immigration, violent protests, and constant wars have engulfed the world, as a side effect it has rendered women infertile; unable to breed future children. It's as if God's saying, 'If you can't play nicely together, you don't deserve the right to live anymore.' The world is slowly coming to an end, and anarchy rules the day. At the start of the picture a man named Theo, played with great skill and charm by Clive Owen, is going through his usual routine of picking up his morning coffee. The televisions report the news that the reported 'youngest person in the world' has officially died after taking his own life. The world gathers around the TV and mourns his loss. It's only seconds later; after Theo gets his coffee that a large bomb violently obliterates the café. This is the world of Children of Men; one of the most brutally realized visions of a future all too real to be simply dismissed purely as being mere 'science fiction'.When Theo is contacted by his ex-wife, Julian (played by Julianne Moore), who has been working with a militant group of vigilantes, she asks for his help in obtaining official government papers that will allow a friend of hers to travel to a safe zone. But when she is suddenly killed by a wild group of rebels, Theo discovers that 'her friend' is a young pregnant woman; just days away from giving birth to the first known baby in over eighteen years, and the possible savior of the human race. Theo takes it upon himself to personally transport the girl through the dangerous countryside and war torn cities of a destroyed England. As Theo tries to escort the woman amongst all the chaos we see a frightening vision of a furious world, painted so vividly, and so painfully real, its images will be burned deep into your subconscious; it's unforgettable. And Cuarón, whose last film was 2004's Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (my favorite in the series), is just the right film maker to bring this uncompromised vision to the big screen. The future has never seemed so real before in any motion picture I've ever seen, and the effect is absolutely chilling.Everything about Children of Men is stunning. From Emmanuel Lubezki's gritty cinematography to an Oscar worthy performance from Clive Owen and a wonderful supporting performance from Michael Caine as an aging, pot-smoking hippie. The film oozes with heat-pounding suspense and gut-wrenching drama at every unexpected turn. And for along time I would have put Paul Greengrass's United 93 or Martin Scorsese's Departed at the top of the list for this year's Best Picture, but by and far this stunning achievement now sits atop the throne of great films this year. It works not only as a human drama, but as a science fiction fable and as an action-thriller; whatever it is that you're looking for in a great movie-going experience, look no further than Alfonso Cuarón's Children of Men. This is an unforgettable film, and in my opinion an instant classic.",10,2,6,6 January 2007
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," 'If we're gonna go down, we might as well go down swinging.'
","Good Night, and Good Luck is an honest and upright look at broadcast politics during the 40's and 50's, when Senator Joseph McCarthy was on a witch hunt to uncover Communist sympathizers living in the U.S. The film, which was directed, co-written and starring George Clooney, is a nice look back at old school film-making, from decades long since past, and is shot in gorgeous black and white looks great. I think more films these days should be made in black and white, because they force you to concentrate on the story and characters, and allow you to not get distracted from anything else.What I meant by 'old school film-making' was that Good Night, and Good Luck isn't buried beneath a lot of modern day film-making techniques; including overindulgent and quick paced editing, or fast, sudden camera movements, or a heavy handed booming musical score. Every thing in Good Night, and Good Luck is underplayed, and aimed at accomplishing a sense of realism, without having to 'amp' anything up, or going dramatically over-the-top. That's what I what I meant by old school film-making, and this is a nice change of pace from the norm, because it's rare to find a film with a relaxed pace, and requires you to think for yourself, and at the same time the film isn't overly long, finishing up in about 90 minutes.At the heart of the picture is Edward R. Murrow, a CBS news journalist, played to perfection by David Strathairn. Murrow standed up to Sen. McCarthy (which is shown using entirely old film stock footage) and his tactics when no body else would, for fear that they too would be seen as a Communist. Murrow is represented as a noble hero, seeking out the truth, and not gossip or rumors; a reporter who believes in integrity and honesty; a real American.This is George Clooney's second film to direct, but he easily convinced me that he'd been directing movies for far longer. He's a man that can not only act, but write, produce and direct as well, now that takes talent. Good Night, and Good Luck was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Director, Actor, Screenplay, Cinematography and Art Direction. Which is pretty much saying that Good Night, and Good Luck is well made, well directed, acted, written and also looks mighty fine as well, and that pretty much sums it up for me.However, the film certainly isn't perfect, and in fact does suffer from a few things. First, the subplot of the married couple, played by Robert Downey, Jr. and Patricia Clarkson felt pointless and tagged on, just some extra 'padding' to increase the already too short running time. The film also lacks strong character development, or arch; the characters never go through any change from the very beginning to the very end. And the film may have also been too fact driven, as if Clooney didn't want to 'Hollywoodize' any part of the film, even if it means creating a more interesting, or riveting plot, or characters. I found these few things to weak the overall feel of the film, but not enough to really discourage me from recommending it, but I must say that out of all the films I saw last year I could name at least five other films I saw that could have and probably should have been nominated for Best Picture over this one. Good Night and Good Luck succeeds in the really important areas; it has a really good message that's backed up by some solid performances and is presented with strict attention to the facts.",8,2,4,18 March 2006
World Trade Center," Not exactly a great film, but important none-the-less
","I think any film that is made about 9/11 is going to be met with high scrutiny and often with a lot of people who'll just turn their noses up at it; claiming that it's just a shameful attempt to cash in on a tragedy to make a profit. To those arrogant, self-indulgent and brainless people who like to judge films before having actually seen them I only have one thing to say; shut up. This film and Paul Greengrass' amazing United 93 serve a bigger, more important purpose than money or profit. These films are meant to inspire, encourage and act as an important reminder of the power and bond that all Americans have to one another in great times of grief and tragedy. Where United 93 was about a group of strangers banding together to fight a common enemy, World Trade Center is about the courage and strength of men who put their lives on the line to help save others. This isn't a film about death and evil and destruction, it's about life, hope, strength, love and the courage to act, and rise up in a time when you are most needed. Any tears that you cry during this film are more likely to be tears of joy.World Trade Center is an Oliver Stone film, that's oddly enough not an Oliver Stone film; there's no political commentary or message, and no conspiracy theories. I don't think America is quite ready for those films, but I don't doubt that at some point they will get made, eventually, but as for now filmmakers seem to be sticking to the reality of what happened on that day and not making up wild stuff and passing it off as the truth. Oliver Stone's usual style of intense editing, use of black & white film and historical stock footage isn't present in World Trade Center. It doesn't look, sound or move like your typical Oliver Stone film; this is probably the most straightforward film in his career, and it works well because of it.This film is based on the incredible true story of two Port Authority Police Officers, John McLoughlin (Nicolas Cage) and Will Jimeno (Michael Pena), who were buried in between the twin towers, below twenty feet of rubble. This is just one story of many on the events of that unforgettable day, but this is their story. John and Will were only two of twenty people that were rescued out of the wreckage of the twin towers. Their story won't just grab your throat, but also touch your heart; it's not in the slightest way depressing, it's downright inspiring. I think this is a film that you don't WANT to see, but you HAVE to see. It's a reminder to live life to the fullest, and to not take it for granted, because you never know what tomorrow may bring.The film balances back and forth from being stuck in the rubble; fighting to stay alive, and showing us what the families of the trapped men go through during the day. The wives want to remain hopefully, but the tension of not knowing what's going on and what's happening are shaking them to their core. And if you think these guys survived the collapse and are safe, and just waited to be rescued, you'd be dead wrong. The danger is very much present the whole time and at any minute they could have been killed. The performances are pretty good, especially Michael Pena as Will Jimeno. Mark my words; this guy's got an Oscar coming to him in his future. Heck, even Jay Hernandez and Stephen Dorff offer solid and respectable performances. Oliver Stone must have done something extraordinary, right? Maggie Gyllenhaal and Maria Bello also deliver durable performances. Although I must say that those bright blue contacts that Maria wore really distracted from her performance. They looked great in Underworld, but here they just look really bad. World Trade Center isn't a great film, and not quite at the same kind of masterful level as United 93 was, but this film is a respectable and important reminder of that tragic day, and it's done with class, emotion and most of all respect.Some people have said that it's too soon for films to be made about the events of 9/11. I think that's bullshit. There have been plenty of books, documentaries (mostly with political agendas) and TV movies made on 9/11, but most of those things have focused on the darkness and death of that day. What's wrong with taking two hours out of your busy day to be reminded of what good that can come out of it? I think we owe at least that much to them. You have to take the good with the bad, and to remember that day as nothing but bad would be a real tragedy.",7,2,8,14 August 2006
2001: A Space Odyssey," Curiously puzzling
","I am not a 'fan' of Stanley Kubrick's work. I don't consider him to be a 'genius' filmmaker, but I do think his work is curiously intriguing and at times daring. So for that I give him respect, but that doesn't mean I'll praise his work. The only film of his that I truly enjoyed was The Shining. Full Metal Jacket I thought was curiously lacking something humanizing, and left me unengaged, unlike Francis Ford Coppola's surrealistic Apocalypse Now. However this film, 2001, I feel very strange about.2001: A Space Odyssey is a thought-provoking sci-fi epic. I say 'thought-provoking' because I had to think my way through this film, and was trying to figure out just what in hell I was watching, or what was going on. I've seen this film once (several years ago), and I plan on seeing it again sometime. Maybe after a few more viewings I'll be able to better understand the film, at least I hope so.The film moves almost unbelievably slowly, border lining on tedium. I mean there's slow, and then there's SLOW. This film is SLOW. But somehow, and believe me I don't know exactly how, it did hold my attention. Like I said above, I was really just trying to figure out what was happening. I liked the character of HAL 9000. Actually I'm a sucker of anything about how technology, a creation of man, comes back to bite them in the ass (i.e. Terminator 2: Judgment Day and The Matrix).I don't understand exactly what 2001 was saying, but it kept me watching with anticipation, one could almost say excitement, but mostly just puzzlement. And for that I respect the film for confusing the hell out of me, because that's doesn't happen often, if ever when I watch a movie. Maybe if Donnie Darko had truly confused me, maybe I would have had more respect for it. And while 2001 may not be my favorite film of Kubrick's, it's certainly one of his more captivating films. I respect this film, but I didn't quite love it, because it left me puzzled. So I'm giving the film a score of an eight out of ten, perhaps upon a second, third or maybe even a fourth viewing I'll reconsider, and give it a higher score.",10,0,4,25 January 2006
The Descent," The Descent is on par with Carpenter's Thing and Scott's Alien
","Neil Marshall. Remember the name; he just might be the next John Carpenter. Personally I've never heard of the man. Four years ago he directed a low budget horror flick called Dog Soldiers. Apparently it must have been a pretty good show, because the sick minds over at Lionsgate gave the dude some quick cash and went on to create one of the years most intense and startling horror-thrillers that manages to easily dodge most of the silly and lame clichés that often plague most modern day horror films. The Decent echoes touches of Ridley Scott's Alien, Brian De Palma's Carrie and John Carpenter's The Thing, and does so in brilliant fashion. I say if you're gonna steal, you might as well steal from the best. The Descent is essentially the polar opposite of Alexander Aja's remake of The Hills Have Eyes; it takes place in a wet and confined climate, deep underground and in total darkness. It's a terrific setting and used amazingly well. This is what I image last year's The Cave was trying to do with a PG-13 rating. Well The Decent most certainly earns it's R-rating and doesn't hold back on any of the blood n' guts. And with a running time of just under a hundred minutes it certainly packs a good, solid punch. This is the stuff classics are made of.The Descent is about a group of six young women who love exploring and adventuring. One of them is still recovering from a horrible accident that occurred over a year ago. Her friend's think she needs to get out, and go on a cave diving exploration trip, hoping that it'll help her take her mind off things and help ease her tension. Yeah, right! As you can tell from the previews there's something not quite so normal about these caves; there's something very evil and terrifying living deep beneath the surface, and worst yet... it's hungry. That's all I'm going to spill on The Descent; it's a film that is a much more effective journey if you don't know what'll happen next. The direction is masterful, the music is gripping and yes, the scares will have you popping' outta your seat! If you like your horror movies with plenty of blood and gore, tons of suspense and extreme tension and a bunch of girls kickin' some serious ass than I'm sure you'll get a real scream out of The Descent. I would easily rank this as one of the scariest and most intense horror films in years. I seriously didn't expect a horror film to match (or even exceed) this year's The Hills Have Eyes, but I was dead wrong. Definitely see this one on the big screen, because it certainly won't feel the same seeing it for the first time on DVD.",10,3,7,4 August 2006
Inside Man," Spike Lee's INSIDE MAN doesn't disappoint
","Spike Lee's Inside Man is a smart, well-crafted heist thriller led by two very good performances from Denzel Washington and Clive Owen. This is a very entertaining and clever thriller that just might require a second viewing, just to make sure that I caught everything. The film runs just a little over two hours long, yet it does seem to run about fifteen or twenty minutes longer than it probably should, but it seemed to keep me in the dark and on the edge of my seat for so much of the film just wondering what in the hell was REALLY going on that I can't deny the fact that I was pretty entertained.I've only seen one other movie directed by Spike Lee; 25th Hour, and looking at this film there certainly are some similarities. I love how Lee shoots his films all over various parts of New York; uptown, downtown, Brooklyn; he really seems to showcase the city quite well, along with the city's diversified ethnicities and races along with it. In Inside Man Lee knows that the audience is paying close attention; trying to figure out how this is all going to end, but he keeps the audience in the dark so well, yet still holding your attention to keep you fascinated and then when you think you've got a handle on what's going on he reveals the truth, and it's usually not quite what you were expecting. This is easily the most entertaining film I've seen so far this year, just passing both V for Vendetta and Thank You for Smoking by a hair.For the sake of surprise I'm going to try my best to avoid giving away too much of the film's plot or its twists. It's a much more enjoyable film to watch going in not knowing very much about it. The film begins with four people dressed as painters walking into the lobby of the Manhattan Trust Bank disabling the bank's security cameras, drawing guns and threatening to blow anyone's head clean off if they don't get their faces on the floor. The scene is riveting and exciting, the first thirty minutes or so of Inside Man is the initial takeover of the bank, and Clive Owen does a marvelous job at playing a menacing bank robbery that clearly means business; so don't mess with him, just do exactly what he tells you to and you won't get hurt. The ringleader is Dalton Russell (Owen), who hides behind a mask and a pair of black sunglasses for so much of the film I starting thinking to myself, 'Man, maybe he could have played V in V for Vendetta?' his character is calm, cool, collective, but at the same time completely menacing and calculative. Once the bank is secured by the robbers we're introduced to NYPD hostage negotiators Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington) and Bill Mitchell (Chiwetel Ejiofor) who get handed the case and arrive at the bank quickly to work along side E.S.U. (Emergency Services Unit) Captain John Darius (played well by Willem Dafoe). They all hope to get the situation revolved peacefully and quickly.The police do what they can to keep the robbers happy, and the hostages safe; they send in bottles of water and plenty of pizzas, they think they've got'em doing exactly what they want, but these aren't your ordinary bank robbers. This robbery has been meticulously and thoroughly planned out, down to the tinniest of details, and the robbers have got the police doing exactly what they want them to do; it's a fun, but equally complex game of cat-and-mouse, and we're not quite sure whose the cat and whose the mouse. The game rambles on and on, throughout the night and into the next day, and it looks like one thing is for certain; these criminals are in absolutely no hurry to escape, but why?Inside Man is a complex, entertaining and very well-acted heist flick, easily the best I've seen since Ocean's Eleven, and it's certainly been one of the most enjoyable rides of 2006 so far. It's refreshing to see something so well done, with so many good actors, and leaves you feeling satisfied. I recommend you check out Inside Man if you're looking for a thriller with as much brains and it does twists and some good performances from Denzel Washington and Clive Owen, and also need further proof that Jodie Foster can play more than just a desperate mother. Inside Man is actually worth the full seven bucks, which is amazing! Now I wonder to myself; could I pull something like that off?",8,2,3,22 April 2006
The Fountain," 'Death is the road to awe.'
","Darren Aronofsky's The Fountain is a film I've been waiting quite awhile to see and now that I've seen it I'm not really sure what to make of it. Yes, I am very much scratching my head over it, because the film could be interpreted in a few different ways. For those expecting to see a love story that spans a thousand years you'll probably be surprised to find that that isn't really the case with The Fountain. The film is set in the present where Tom Creo (Hugh Jackman) a neurologist, is obsessively and desperately searching for a cure to his wife's (Izzi) brain tumor. As her health is withering away she begins to write a novel calledyou guessed it -- 'The Fountain'; about a sixteenth century Spanish conquistador's dangerous quest to find the biblical 'Tree of Life' (go read Genesis folks, Chapter 3, verse 24) found in the Garden of Eden.The majority of the film is set in the present day as we watch Tom try to find a cure for brain tumors and comfort Izzi; who's pretty much accepted her fate and is no longer afraid of dying, while Tom tries to save her he struggles to accept defeat. The film cuts back and forth between three parallel stories; the sixteenth century Spanish conquistadors, the present day search for a cure and the future, where Tom is encased in a large bubble moving through space heading towards a dying nebula. It is my own personal interpretation that this 'future' storyline is really just a visual representation of what Tom is thinking inside his head during the present day events as they unfold. But I could be wrong, that's just my take on it. Aronofsky attempts to turn modern cinema into an artistic expression of poetry, only on a visual medium. It may be too much for some to handle, but it's nice to see somebody try hard to make something bold and different for a change.Visually it's a grand film, which as surprising as it may seem consisted of little to no CGI or computer effects. Those scenes taking place in space are actually chemical reactions filmed up-close in Petri dishes (cool, huh?). The film strives to be nothing short of a masterpiece, but I don't think Aronofsky's latest quite reaches the same heights of emotional power and sheer thrill as his last film; 2000's soul crushing opus, Requiem for a Dream (one of my favorite movies of all-time). Yes, The Fountain isn't bulletproof, it does have some flaws. Sometimes it can be a challenge to overlook some of those flaws, but they're worth overlooking in order to take in the film's vastly more important and awe-inspiring ideas. It's artsy, maybe just a little too much, and at times perhaps pretentious, but the themes and emotions running throughout The Fountain are so raw and fully exposed they cut deep to the core of every person, especially if you've ever known the pain of losing someone you held deal.When I first came out of the theater I felt disappointed, then confused, then fascinated, then confused again. There's no doubt in my mind that you'll either love this film or hate it; it's just one of those kinds of movies. But at least one thing's for sure  The Fountain is unlike any other movie you've seen this year or last or the year before that. It's more of an experience, a state of mind, and an exploration of the soul. Director Darren Aronofsky's film doesn't provide any answers, but it does raise a few questions and will most certainly get you thinking. This is an excellent conversation starter and I could see this as being in someway the ultimate date-movie for those looking for a unique challenge. I didn't quite love this movie (even though I desperately wanted to), and I didn't quite hate it either. I was fascinated by it, hypnotized by it, and even puzzled by it. And with a sensational musical score by Clint Mansell layered on top it's probably the closest you'll ever get to having a semi-religious or spiritual experience at the movies. Don't go into The Fountain trying to understand it using your head, instead try following through its multiple story lines by following your heart.",7,2,4,22 November 2006
The Departed," Scorsese goes back, once again to gangsterland.
","The Departed tells the story of two men working for the Boston state police; one is mole working inside the mob, and the other is a mole working for the Irish mob boss. Leonard DiCaprio plays Billy Costigan, the cadet police officer sent undercover to infiltrate the Irish mob, which is headed by Frank Costello, played by the wickedly wonderful and outrageous Jack Nicholson. Matt Damon plays Colin Sullivan, the mole inside the police force that tips off Costello on the police's activity while trying to put him away. Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg also star as police officers that are heading the investigation into putting Costello and his whole crew behind bars (or in a casket). Costigan works his way into the mob and Sullivan works his way up into the internal affairs unit of the state police, who is actually sent in to investigate who's been tipping off the mob.You can see a bunch of Scorsese's touches throughout the film; from his music selections (great use of Dropkick Murphys, but The Rolling Stones song is getting a bit old now), to long tracking shots and plenty of disturbing outbursts of violence; which hit you like a sledgehammer to face in the film's final moments. Where The Departed really shines are the performances. DiCaprio is great, and this is probably his best performance to date. Damon comes through, but he won't exactly blow you away, he usually delivers good work and he doesn't disappoint here. Nicholson is a scene stealing weasel that will probably be compared to, and loved much like Pesci's wild and crazy work in Goodfellas and Casino. Nicholson is perfectly cast and has a lot of fun playing a character so wildly evil and nefarious you just love to hate the son of a bitch. And what's up with Alec Baldwin? Seriously, when was the last time he was in a film this good, and seemed to be having so much fun. And Martin Sheen was also good, but he really wasn't given enough to do in my opinion.Whether or not Martin Scorsese will actually admit that his latest film, The Departed, is a remake of the Hong Kong thriller, Infernal Affairs, remains to be seen. I probably would have gotten a little bit more enjoyment out of The Departed had it actually been an original Scorsese film like Goodfellas or Casino, but this film pretty much follows the same exact plot as Infernal Affairs; beat for beat, up until the film's last minute twist ending which, no that I think about it actually does kind of make sense. Should you see The Departed in theaters? Yes, absolutely! Especially when you look at all the other amazingly craptastic movies playing in theaters right now you should definitely go out and see it, hell, see it just for the great performances; they alone are worth the price of admission. Actually the more and more I think about it, the more I love this movie. I'll definitely need to see it again, and if necessary again and again. I actually could see myself rating this one as a ten after multiple viewings.",10,2,5,6 October 2006
War of the Worlds," This is a close encounter of the best kind
","H.G. Wells' famous novel, War of the Worlds, has been done many times before; a radio broadcast, a movie in the 50's, an 80's TV series, an online comic and even a 70's musical, yes, that's right, a musical! Now it's Steven Spielberg's turn. Spielberg previously worked with aliens from outer space in Close Encounters of the Third Kind and E.T., but now Spielbergio has shed that whole 'aliens are cute' theory and thrown it right into the shredder. In War of the Worlds the aliens are relentless killing machines.The film follows Ray (Cruise), a full-time blue-collar dock worker and part-time dead-beat dad, whose kids are more of a weekend hassle for him than real family members. As it turns out it's his turn to watch the kids (Rachel and Robbie) this weekend while their mother and step-father head up to Boston to visit family. Everything seemed to be going just about normal for this family that is until all hell breaks loose when an alien invasion suddenly sprouts up out of the ground, literally! The aliens' tripods rise out of the ground and start blasting people left and right with lasers causing them to burst into ashes. From this moment on the rest of the film is one big spectacle of amazing special effects, booming surround sound and total anarchy; which echoes imagery of 9/11 and the Holocaust.The film was written by David Koepp who previously worked with Spielberg on Jurassic Park. The performances are real, and pretty believable, not a single one stuck out, or bothered me at all. I can understand why Rachel would scream so much she's only ten and people are getting killed all around her! I can understand why Robbie hates his father, and wants to fight back, he's young and rebellious. And I can understand Harlan, the nut-case trapped in the basement with a shotgun yearning to lead a surprise attack on the aliens. The cinematography is a little weak, at one moment it looks cold and steely and next it's gritty and a little fuzzy, but it's pretty much the same old Spielberg style that he's used since Saving Private Ryan. And some of the tricks played in the basement seemed like they were ripped straight from the Jurassic Park screenplay (Raptors in the kitchen anyone?).For many people they'll just sit down and watch War of the Worlds and look at it as just another alien invasion flick, and on the surface it might look like just another 'survive the alien attack!' movie, but I think it's really deeper than that. Just like Spielberg's Artificial Intelligence, War of the Worlds might just have flown a little too high, over many peoples radars. As much as the film may look like a film about how we will survive an alien invasion, it's also about how will we, as humans, be able to survive ourselves, and how we'll either come together to help our survival (like the scene where Robbie tries to help people climb onto the ferry), or how we'll end up fighting ourselves (like the crazy mob that takes over the van). It's just as much about how they survived the aliens as how they were able to survive each other, and by setting the main characters up as a broken or 'warring' family only helps the plot even more.In Wells' novel it was about one man returning home to find his wife (who he thought was killed in the invasion) alive and well, even though he had already assumed and pretty much already accepted that she was already dead. This is pretty true to the book, they only changed it do Ray's son instead of his wife. Many people complain about this plot twist, saying it was unnecessary, but if you know Wells' novel it is essential. We never see Robbie killed; we simply accept it or assume it. Notice a group of retreating humvees leaving the hill (some are on fire); now think about it carefully. You assume Robbie is dead or has been killed by the explosion, but you can't sure about that, because like Ray you didn't see all of what happened, so it is possible that he could have escaped the alien attack just in time it is possible. Sure it's an assumption, but it's not any more right or wrong than assuming that he is already dead.The original '52 War of the Worlds film was an analogy for nuclear war, because nuclear war was considered 'the huge threat' at that time, and in Spielberg's film the alien invasion is an analogy for terrorism in a post-9/11 world. There are tons of references to this through out the film; the posting of pictures of family member that are missing as a way of searching to find one another, 'Is it the terrorists?' Robbie asks Ray when their neighborhood is being obliterated; a smoldering plane wreck reminded me of United Flight 93. And if you watch the scene where Robbie supposedly dies on the hill from 'the explosion', look carefully at the left side of the screen during this scene and you can see the image of one of the Twin Towers smoking, I'm not joking, it's really there, look carefully. And then of course there's the reference that Harlan makes about how 'occupations never last', which is clearly a reference to the Iraq War. I've seen the film many times and I still don't think I've caught all the references, but every time I sit down and watch this film the more I notice things in it, whether done intentionally or not I don't know, but one thing I know for sure is that Spielberg isn't an idiot just trying to blow stuff up, but to also allow us to think a little bit. Simply put; different people see different things, and it's up to the individual to determine what it is that they really see.",10,0,2,16 April 2006
Stranger Than Fiction," Stranger than fiction, but much better than average
","Marc Forster's latest film maybe stranger than fiction, but thankfully it's also much better than the average movie playing at your local theater, well almost. It's seems that ever since Scorsese's Departed just about every week there's been a new movie that's actually really good and finally there seems to be a reason to keep returning to the movies. Hey, they're finally making some good stuff for a change! In Stranger than Fiction Will Ferrell plays a calm and orderly IRS auditor named Harold Crick; a man who lives for his job, day in and day out. Harold seemingly has one friend at work, Dave (played by Tony Hale, formerly of TV's Arrested Development), no private relationships and no personal life what-so-ever, and his entire existence is about getting up and going to and from work. Harold is stuck in a never-ending routine that is disturbed one morning while brushing his teeth. While counting the number of brush strokes Harold begins to hear a strange woman's voice narrating the things he's doing as he's doing them. The voice is that of Kay Eiffel, a depressed, chain smoking and very talented author whose come down with a serious case of writer's block. When Harold discovers that Kay's novels are quite famous for their tragic endings, where the hero always dies, he seeks the help of literary professor Jules Hibert, played by the always entertaining Dustin Hoffman, to help get to the bottom of Harold's problem.Two-time Oscar winner Emma Thompson gives a wonderfully distressed performance as the author that shakes up Harold's life, and Queen Latifah plays an assistant brought in to help Kay break through her writer's block and get back to finishing her new novel. Harold is driven crazy by the voice of the narrator in his head, and is heart is aching for a feisty young woman named Ana, played with a free and wild spirit by Maggie Gyllenhaal, who he's assigned to audit for failing to pay all her taxes as a way of sticking' it to the government. As Harold comes closer and closer to his demise he falls in love with Ana and discovers how sweet life can be with just a few cookies and a glass of milk. Life can be so sweet; we just have to go after it, each and every day. But time is running out for Harold and he is desperately trying to track down this mysterious author while there's still time to stop her from finishing her novel.Director Marc Forster, whose last films included last year's Stay and the imaginative Finding Neverland has crafted a wonderfully entertaining and equally smart film with some great performances from one of the best ensemble casts this year, right next to Little Miss Sunshine. Will Ferrell gives what is easily his best performance of his career, and his most sincerely enjoyable since Elf. Stranger than Fiction does for Will Ferrell what Eternal Sunshine did for Jim Carrey; it's just the right material for the right actor, and I'd love to see Farrell do more roles like this one and lay off the Anchorman kind of stuff for awhile and give him some room to grow as an actor. I don't know what its Oscar chances are, but given the films that have already come out this fall in my book all bets are off; expect a very close and interesting Oscar race.Stranger than Fiction is part comedy, part drama and part romance; there's a little bit of something for everyone. I found myself getting so wrapped up in the film's premise and constantly thinking to myself; 'How is this all going to come together in the end?' so much so I was never bored for a single moment and not only was I fascinated with it's ideas, but I was also quite touched emotionally with it's engaging performances. I really enjoyed this movie, and more importantly its message. Yes, on the surface Stranger than Fiction may look like a Charlie Kaufman-esquire psycho-babble 'weird $hit happens' movie in the vein of Being John Malkovich or Adaptation, but beneath it all there's something that those films didn't quite have  a beating heart, without all the cynicism.",9,0,3,10 November 2006
Casino Royale," 'I'm sorry, that last hand... nearly killed me.'
","Bond is back, and edgier than ever before. Casino Royale, much like last summer's Batman Begins, reboots the tired and formulaic James Bond franchise by taking everything up a notch and giving us a darker, more complex Bond, and a script that's smart and sophisticated and creates heroes from the ground up that we care about and sinister villains we love to hate. Better yet  it gives us a reason to give a damn this time, by making things personal. Bond has been played many times before and by many different faces, many will say that Sean Connery was and forever will be the one true Bond and I would have to agree with that. For the last seven years Pierce Brosnan brought 007 to the big screen and he was a great choice as well. Following in his footsteps comes Daniel Craig, a new Bond for a generation; a Bond will killer instincts and sharp wits to match his lethal skills. Living up to the reputations of Brosnan and Connery is just about one of the hardest gigs in Hollywood, but thankfully GoldenEye director Martin Campbell returns to 007 with a great cast and a number of electrifying action sequences to pull you on the edge of your seat. I think Campbell should just direct Bond movies for the rest of his career.The film starts off with James Bond acquiring his 00 status after a double assassination in Prague, and then after a visually blazing opening credits sequences races us to Madagascar, where Bond is trying to hunt down a bomb maker which ends up in one long breathtaking marathon of an action sequence. When the operation turns into a massive catastrophe M, played with an anger and scorn by Judi Dench, questions if Bond is really the right man to be part of the 00 echelon of MI6. But before she can do anything about it he's off to the Bahamas to independently track down track down a terrorist cell run by a man named Dimitrios. In the process romances his girlfriend, Solange, and thwarts a terrorist bombing.Bond sure knows how to get around, but when MI6 learns that Dimitrios was funded by an evil banker known as Le Chiffre, played excellently by Mads Mikkelsen, who launders money through a casino in Montenegro to finance terrorists operations around the world Bond is set by MI6 to play against his in a high-stakes poker game. He's accompanied by a beautiful accountant (and cleavage extraordinaire), Vesper Lynd, played by the stunning Eva Green. Bond's interest in her deepens as they face life and death situations together and even some brutal torture (Ouch! Now that's gotta hurt!) at the hands of Le Chiffre. In Montenegro, Bond allies himself with Mathis MI6's local field agent, Mathis. The marathon game proceeds with dirty tricks and violence, raising the stakes beyond blood money and reaching a terrifying climax.I haven't seen all of Bond movies, but I'm certainly not a stranger to them. A lot of people are saying Casino Royale is the best of the bunch, and as of now it has the highest rating in the 007 series on the Internet Movie Database, at 8.1, with Goldfinger trailing closely behind with 7.8. I'm not sure if Royale is in fact the best Bond film, but it's certainly one of the best and without a doubt the strongest since the 60's, when Connery reined supreme, and that's saying quite a lot really. I liked Craig as Bond, and could easily see him doing more 007 movies. I especially liked his British accent which seems like it's been missing from the series for a really long time. I loved the cars, the locations, the performances, the villains, the babes (oh the babes!) and the action. Casino Royale is an excellent film, with its only flaw being that it doesn't quite know when to cash its chips in; running about twenty minutes too long, but even that didn't seem to impact my feels about it. This is a solid and exciting thriller and perhaps the best action film of the year (sorry M:I:III). Bond is most certainly back and more alive than ever before.",10,0,2,18 November 2006
X2: X-Men United," 'Sometimes the mind needs to discover things for itself.'
","2000's smash hit X-Men certainly deserved a sequel (or two, or three), especially with all the cash it made and how the first one ended. Now the X-Men are back together once again, and this time they've got some new friends, including Nightcrawler and Pyro, and as well as some new enemies like William Stryker and Lady Deathstrike (his personal mutant 'assistant'/slave). This time the X-Men find themselves locked in an unlikely alliance with Magneto and Mystique (their nemeses from the first film) against an evil military scientist named William Stryker, whose main goal is to eradicate the world of mutants once and for all.X2: X-Men United is in many ways an improvement over the first film. It's more psychological, it's longer, there's more action, more mutants, more of Wolverine slicing it up and like the first film it's never boring or drags, right from the get-go X2 is fierce and exciting. In fact, X2 is almost the perfect comic book film almost. The one little, weak link in X2, for me at least, was Nightcrawler. Now, I like the character of Nightcrawler, but I honestly didn't care that much for Alan Cumming, he came off as a bit weak, and kind of 'dorky'. The character of Nightcrawler really just seems like a huge convenience to the plot; like the scene where he rescues Rogue in the X-Jet, which was oh so very convenient. But the one thing I liked about Nightcrawler, besides that awesome opening sequence in the White House, was his religious side, which I thought was interesting and made me sympathize with the character a little more.Pretty much everything in X2 works perfectly fine, which I attribute all that success to the amazing cast (Jackman, McKellen, Stewart, Marsden, Janssen, Berry, Paquin, Cox, Romijn), and the fact that the film was written and directed by the same people who clearly knew what they were doing back in 2000, and here they show us once again they still know what they're doing, and they aren't afraid to up the ante and take it up a notch. If you liked the first X-Men there's really no reason at all why wouldn't enjoy or like X2 as much, or maybe even more than the first film. It still has those surprising moments of humor, and plenty of action, maybe even more so than the original. And like the original, X2 sets itself up for a third film; let's just hope it turns out (at the very least) as good as the first two films, if not better.",7,47,62,18 April 2006
Munich," Spielberg goes for the jugular
","Right from the get-go Steven Spielberg goes for the jugular without pause or hesitation in the opening moments of Munich, his latest film about the events that happened after the 1972 Olympic terrorist massacre. Of course I wasn't alive to have experienced this myself, but what's up on the big screen is nothing short of breathtaking, and shocking. I almost feel as if I did experience it in the same way as many people did back in '72, sitting on their sofa's watching it on television. The opening scenes are brutal, vicious and gut-wrenching, and the same can be said for the rest of what follows afterwards. For those who may have thought that Spielberg might have been 'losing it' or 'getting soft', clearly they don't know crap, and obviously haven't seen this film. This is Spielberg's darkest and most razor-sharp film in years, right along side Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List. There's just something about the way Spielberg does historically based non-fiction, you get sucked in, you're there...and he's always firing on all cylinders.Munich is 164 minutes long, and from the start of it Mr. Spielberg demands that you pay attention. The film follows five agents working unofficially for the Israeli secret service to hunt down and assassinate the 11 terrorists that were believed to have been behind the planning the murders of the 11 Israeli athletes during the Olympics in Munich. Leading the team is Avner, who's brilliantly played by Eric Bana, a man who at first feels perfectly fine about taking up this new assignment, but as their assassinations go down, one by one, he starts to feel as if it's all been for nothing. Members of his own team are being hunted down by Arab terrorists, who are getting back at Avner and his team for their assassinations. It goes back and forth, we kill them, they kill us, and it never ends. And in the end Avner fears for his life, his wife and his new born baby, that possibly around every corner, or in any car someone might be trying to kill him. Avner's paranoia is both very real and very haunting, and the things he has done in the name of his country have left scars that will haunt him for the rest of his days.Munich is one of only a few films to come out of Hollywood that seems to support the idea that killing for revenge is not only a terrible thing, but ultimately pointless. The only other film I've seen in years that suggests the same thing was Clint Eastwood's Mystic River, another great film. Unlike films like Kill Bill or Man on Fire, Munich shows us that revenge is a cycle that never ends; violence begets more violence. And the story and situation that's presented in Munich relates strongly to what's going on in our world, right now as I write this very review. These are the kinds of films that people NEED to see, because they have powerful messages, and they NEED to be heard. This is without a doubt one of my favorite films of 2005. And if the Academy Awards weren't so political, this film should, at the very least get a few Oscar nominations. Why can't there be more films like this?",10,2,5,9 January 2006
V for Vendetta," One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter
","I bought a copy of the graphic novel V for Vendetta last August and quickly read through it in about five days. I was left stunned and amazed. And now, almost eight months later after having seen the film adaptation of the book I am still left somewhat stunned and amazed, but also somewhat disappointed. Don't get me wrong V for Vendetta is a pretty good movie; it's smart, thought-provoking, exciting and makes for a great conversation starter. But to me the Wachowski Brothers did tinker quite a bit with the graphic novel, in some ways good, and in some ways very bad. But even with those changes I still rather enjoyed my time at the movies. I just hope those who do go out and see it will leave the theater with the urgent feeling of going out and reading the graphic novel.First off, before we get into it let me just express my appreciation for the two lead performances from Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving. Both of them turn in great performances that do the source material real justice. Where was this Natalie Portman during the Star Wars movies? And Hugo Weaving had an amazing challenge having to act through a mask the entire film with a fixed facial expression and in the end was able to still create a character that you can at one moment hate, and at another love. The beginning of the film differs from the book, and it was pretty pointless to have changed it, but the film's ending I must say is a real knockout, so much so that I thought for a moment I might actually be blown out of the back wall of the theater and into the parking lot. The screenplay which was written by Andy and Larry Wachowski does drop the ball every now and again. A lot of the graphic novel has been changed, altered, or tossed out. Like I said before some of the changes are good, and others are bad. But the overall essence of the V for Vendetta graphic novel is somehow quite intact, but for those of you reading this who haven't yet seen the film, or read the graphic novel, don't worry I won't spoil anything for you.The plot sounds very similar to George Orwell's 1984, which even author Alan Moore admits was one of many major influences on V for Vendetta when he wrote it back in the early 80's. In fact that's what helps make V for Vendetta a really great story and ultimately a really good movie; the issues and topics it takes on, and to this day we are still talking about them. V for Vendetta wasn't written two or three years ago, but over twenty years ago, and it still holds up. The story imagines a place where, what if Germany had won WWII, and England became a fascist state; where freedom is a long forgotten thing of the past. And one man, who was horrifically scarred both mentally and psychically by this government, decides to strike back using terrorist tactics trying to start a revolution or uprising, and inspire and lead his fellow countrymen to freedom. He calls himself V, and he wears a Guy Fawkes mask. V saves a young woman named Evey from some nasty Policemen late one night, eventually Evey grows to respect and admire him, and soon becomes his protégé.V for Vendetta is a dark, intense comic book film more along the lines of Batman Begins. It's a serious film with some serious ideas. Some parts are quite uncomfortable to sit through because it is so contemporary, while others are a fiery blast of adrenaline to the eyes (and the ears). The film does take a few liberties, and takes a few extra jabs at conservatives, who oddly enough weren't actually mentioned by name in the book to begin with. Some people will look at this film as an anti-Bush film; some will just merely say it's an anti-fascism film. Some will say that the character of V is a terrorist, and others will say he's a freedom fighter. Just remember one thing; the guy who's calling V a terrorist is basically a caricature of Adolf Hitler. A terrorist against Hitler, is that really such a bad thing? So I think depending on how you go into this film, and how you look at things will ultimately help determine how much you like, or dislike it. Personally I never saw the character of V as a terrorist, but as a revolutionary. V doesn't quite fit the bill of a terrorist. I mean he never goes out and intends to harm innocent people, in fact the only people that are on his 'list' if you want to call it that, are precisely government officials and the ones responsible for turning him into the monster that he is.The film also touches on a number of hot button issues such as, well terrorism for starters, and the tactics used by terrorists, like suicide bombings. It also makes a statement on the persecution of homosexuals, a Bishop with a pedophile problem and it even manages to show us how the media can, or does manipulate the news; which ultimately affects what we chose to believe or not believe. This is a very risky picture to be sure, and not everyone's gonna like it, that's just the way it is. But when all is said and done, it will leave you with something to think about afterwards. And even though the film may have messed around with the graphic novel a little too much, it's still the same journey, and it still raises a lot of the same questions, and for those reasons alone makes V for Vendetta the first must-see film of 2006.",6,1,4,17 March 2006
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," 'Momma, I'm going' fast!'
","Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby is without a doubt the funniest film of 2006. If you liked Anchorman and The 40-Year-Old Virgin and seeing Will Ferrell play a silly Nascar driver sounds funny to you then you better rush out to the theater and check this one out. I haven't laughed this hard, or consistently since Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang; Talladega Nights is the one of the best rides of the summer. Will Ferrell plays Ricky Bobby, a superstar Nascar racer that fires up the race track winning race after race will the help of his trusty sidekick and long time best friend Cal Naughton, Jr., played well by John C. Reilly. The two are a dynamic duo in the race world and things seemed to going great, that is until a gay French Formula One racer named Jean Girard, played by a slimy Sacha Baron Cohen, with a ridiculously hilarious accent. Jean hits the Nascar circuit like a hurricane and just like that, Ricky Bobby finds himself out of the league and forced to deliver pizzas to make money. But with some good old fashioned ass kickin' help from Ricky's long lost father, Reese, played to absolute perfection by the great Gary Cole (you might remember him as the boss from Office Space); he'll be back on the race track in no time to duel with the slimy Jean Girard.Talladega Nights brings on the laughs and loads of silliness right from the start and never really let's up. And I would go as far as saying that this movie does top Anchorman in not only laughs, but overall entertainment as well, but on the downside, the film does seem to miss a few good opportunities here and there. David Koechner is underused and not really given enough to do, which is a real shame considering how funny he was in Anchorman and Thank You for Smoking, and the story is a bit predictable, but always hilarious. But if you can forgive the thin plot and some of the one-note characters I think you'll have one hell of a fun time. Anchorman director Adam McKay has assembled a great cast with plenty of comedic talent, and as we watch them have fun they don't forget to bring us along for the ride. Talladega Nights is a pure laugh riot of silliness for both racing fans and non-fans alike, and it works so well for the majority of the time it's hard to walk away feeling the slightest bit of disappointment.",8,0,3,12 August 2006
