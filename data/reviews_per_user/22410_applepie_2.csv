Minority Report," Scary and fascinating but not a milestone of movie-making.
","Here's what I liked: Scary visions of what the future might bring us. Spielberg (or Philip K. Dick respectively) manages to present credible images of what might be an even closer future, closer than 50 years from now. I started thinking...and biting my fingernails...forgetting the story. Speaking of which, this is the part I didn't like, at least not that much. Confusing plot with too many glitches. Actually, I just bought the DVD and found the 2nd DVD (bonus material) at least as entertaining as the movie itself. Now I leave it up to you to decide whether that means the DVD edition is really good or the movie just failed to 'push me out of my socks' as we Germans say.",Null,0,0,29 March 2003
Back to the Future," Try and taste this one!
","What really amazed (and still amazes) me about this film is its incredible balance. It's like cooking a good meal: The mixture is as important as the ingredients. And in this case, long before 'Forrest Gump' made it to the big screen, Robert Zemeckis had already proven to be an excellent chef. Take superb acting by Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd, mix it with a well-written script, add some nice little special effects, stir it real nice while seasoning it with some fine music, et voil√†: You'll end up with a wonderful time-travel science fiction comedy that is still far more enjoyable than almost everything else Hollywood came up with in the last 15 years. It's tough to summarize the plot in just one sentence, but I guess it would sound something this: High-School guy Marty (Fox) accidently jumps 30 years back in time and tries to figure out how to get back to the future without changing it, except for one thing, which is the death of his buddy and time-travel inventor Doc Emmit Brown (Lloyd).This is another one of my all time favorites. It's a great family picture and a must see for all movie buffs anyway. Watch for details...it's worth it! I lost count, but I think I've seen more than 25 times. But just talking about this movie makes me feel like...where was that tape again....???",Null,0,1,20 August 2000
