The Blair Witch Project," The Blair Witch Project
","'We are going to die out here.' Hard to believe it's been practically a decade since 'The Blair Witch Project' was all the buzz, revolting some with how it would not give in allowing us to see what is terrorizing these three unfortunate would-be documentarian filmmakers, causing some audience-goers to almost up-chuck at the dizzying, skakey camera work(..but, if you think about it, this only gives this piece merit, these are amateur filmmakers who have yet to truly master the right form of precise camera-movement), and leaving many furiously duped at how producers claimed it was real, that footage of vanished film students had been found and pieced together for our benefit. Watching it for the first time since, hell, 2000 I guess, I was surprised at how this gave me the creeps. It was as if I were with them, deep into the woods lost, the sinister trappings of wilderness imprisoning me. I envisioned just what it would be like, there in that tent hearing noises out in the distance, even those giggly sounds of children brought chills up and down my spine..particularly when you see and hear the slight pounding on the exterior of the tent. I mean, snapping twigs and sticks out in the darkness actually gave me the willies. At first, I could understand how three film students, Heather, Josh, & Michael would find their little adventure such a thrill..it was like a vacation with the goal of capturing a documentary for an extra grade in school lifting their average of say B- to possibly a B+. This documentary, as seen early on, seems to be little more than to photograph and convey the legend of some Witch who supposedly haunts the woods. It's treated with rolled eyes as locals share what they know second-hand about it, providing our students with fuel for later laughter. I enjoyed how, as this continues, the camaraderie deteriorates eventually leading to shouting matches and ridicule. I found this actually rather believable and realistic, it worked for me. I could see a couple of people I either barely know, or know just from reputation, getting lost with yours truly as the guide with these sort of reactionary emotions and situations happening. These are just people with everyday jobs hoping for brighter futures facing unforeseen horrors which spiral out of their control despite the fact that getting lost in the woods in our modern age shouldn't happen. Is it some mythical witch behind the spooky noises and unusually shaped rocks and stick-men? The film sure paints a picture of this in the final moments as Heather and Michael enter an eerie dilapidated house with children's hand-prints and ritualistic symbols inscribed on the walls as Josh cries for their help. The basement with a person standing with their face to the wall as a camera falls helpless to the ground after a hard thud sure opens up the scary idea that something truly disturbing was happening away from the camera. I like not knowing because I could just imagine the horrors taking place as if it were me being treated to a rude awakening that far from the civilization I know lies in the heart of the wilderness evil has freedom over those unlucky enough to enter it's domain. I know that a lot of f-king people hate this with an absolute passion, but this sure worked for me..I mean just think about it for a minute:lost in the woods, sounds and voices in the distance, you have heard about a supposed witch haunting the woods, one amongst your party is kidnapped with his agony just out of reach echoing the wilderness, and rocks(..not to mention something bloody wrapped in a napkin, neatly intertwined within sticks, cloth & string)formed in a specific manner warning you that you are not alone. It sure would have me peeing in my pants.",10,4,8,12 August 2008
The Incredible Hulk," The Incredible Hulk
","Odd casting makes THE INCREDIBLE HULK, in my mind, an interesting feature film, a second attempt to right the wrongs of Ang Lee's HULK. Ultimately, as others in the past have mentioned, by the end, it turns into a video game duel between two monster titans with New York City(..a setting which seems to work quite well as a place where destruction occurs to such a devastating degree)the battleground as civilians, buildings, and transport vehicles are leveled in the process.A scrawny Ed Norton is cast as Bruce Banner, an innocent University student who thought he was testing a serum in regards to 'radiation resistance', but his girlfriend Betty's(Live Tyler) military father, General Ross(William Hurt, wearing a hair piece and facial war scars) had actually tricked him..it's in fact a genetic experiment Bruce was injecting, therefore he suffers the horrifying side-effects. If Bruce's heart rate reaches a certain high point, upon excitement, he mutates into a gargantuan, muscular monster rampaging through those who dare to combat it. Tim Roth, in an unusual role, is a Russian(..raised in Britain)soldier Emil Blonsky, called in by Ross to find Bruce, soon injecting him with formulas which enhance his recuperative powers and combative skills. Blonsky embraces a difficult opponent, enjoys a challenge, and yearns for the same ability(..to become an unstoppable force like the green hulk)Bruce has. Tim Blake Nelson(..who I think steals the entire film from everyone who shares the screen with him)is a, energetic, unflappable NYC scientist, Samuel Sterns, who Bruce has contacted over the internet regarding his specific condition, looking for a cure that can kill the beast within(..he looks at it as a disease).Actually, my favorite part of the film was the thrilling chase through Rio de Janeiro, as Bruce attempts to escape his pursuers, military men led by Blonsky and Ross, leaping across roof tops and into crowded streets..it's quite exciting like a Bourne actioner. The action sequence within a juice bottle factory as unfriendly Brazilian co-workers bring the dormant hulk out from hiding, as Blonsky's men close in, is a stunner. Norton and Tyler really have good chemistry and their characters' romance isn't overwrought. Hurt isn't as intense or angered as Sam Elliot's version in Lang's film..he's more methodical and cold-blooded. Roth is pure machismo and menace. You can see that he lives for combat against an enemy. The Abomination character is quite hideous with it's deformities(..obviously thanks to those ill-advised injections which basically fed more fuel to an adrenaline junkie who covets competition). Great cameos featuring Lou Ferrigno(..still has bulging muscles)and Stan Lee(..the unfortunate who drinks a 'tainted' juice containing Bruce's blood!)..nice tribute to Bill Bixby as well. Quite a lengthly battle sequence within a college campus between Hulk and Ross' soldiers, using all the weaponry and tanks at their disposal. As expected, the film is effects-heavy at times with Bruce staying active on the run, a fugitive who gains an ally in Betty(..who sternly disagrees with her father's operation)along the way. Norton is among an interesting crop of fine multi-talented A-listers assuming the role of hero in Summer Blockbusters.",7,2,3,11 May 2009
The Monuments Men," The Monuments Men
","Well, I have to be honest in that this has a fascinating story about how a certain group of art historians/restorers were put together by Frank Stokes (George Clooney who also directed) and assigned to find stolen works of art (by the Nazis and Hitler) in Europe as the Germans are on the verge of losing the war. The Russians are also securing what works Stokes and company is unable to. Cate Blanchett is Claire Simone, a French Resistance spy working as an art specialist with the Nazis and her assistance is desired by Matt Damon's James Granger. She just might know where the Nazis are taking specific works of art, and Granger will have to earn her trust. What Frank and his group want to do is find and return the art works to where they belong or in a safe place not to be exploited or kept buried in caves or mines. German soldiers are still out and about, so the Monuments Men (their title) will need to be careful (two of the men will die due to enemy fire). What one of the men dies for (the Madonna) is significantly desired by Frank, motivated by the death because he doesn't want him to have given his life in vain. With a absolutely terrific supporting cast (Bill Murray, with his share of deadpan comedy scenes (including the easing of a young German soldier and speaking about the likelihood of a mine Damon stands on being a dud), John Goodman, The Artist's Jean Dujardin (who steals the picture from his American counterparts), Bob Balaban (who has some really fun scenes opposite Murray), and Dimitri Leonidas (as a helpful soldier who speaks German)), The Monuments Men should be a homerun, but it settles on being a double in the outfield. The leisure pace, a surprising lack of suspense, and distinct approach that focuses less on the horrors of war and avoids the ugly aspects (and atrocities) of what the Nazis had committed in favor of the attaining of the art works, The Monuments Men will have a small audience, I'm afraid, that will appreciate and like it. With the kind of cast this movie has, it should be a certified hit, but the film just doesn't really leap from the screen and grab you. Every scene fails to really generate that thrill and excitement of 'the treasures hunt' although I did feel Clooney and his filmmaking team care deeply about what the film represents. All that said, I didn't dislike it, and it has some nice moments here and there, with the performances respectable and commendable (if not extraordinary, I must sadly admit). Dujardin's charm and Murray and Balaban's rapport are some pleasant ingredients in the film. I think the mission is never in doubt, removing a key bit of tension, however. The acting in the film remains as reserved and relaxed as the pacing of the film. The period is well created by Clooney and his filmmaking team. Again, not a bad movie, just not the knockout it perhaps should have been.",6,0,0,8 January 2015
Mission: Impossible III," Run, Tom, Run
","Ethan(Tom Cruise, who puts in a demandingly physical performance)is retired from field work, engaged, and happy until he's called upon to rescue an operative he trained(Keri Russell)from an evil black market 'deliverer', Owen Davian(Philip Seymour Hoffman, who makes a great villain within the screen time he's given). When that mission ends tragically, Ethan and his MI task force(consisting of one-two-three punch of Ving Rhames, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, & Maggie Q)will join to try and stop Davian's selling of weaponry and other dangerous war toys to varying countries. Davian is a national threat to everyone and must be stopped. What Ethan doesn't know, however, is that someone within his own organization is partnering with Davian. What's even worse is that Ethan's beloved wife Julia(the delightful Michelle Monaghan)is in grave danger(as evident, it seems, in the opening harrowing sequence).With seemingly insurmountable odds(the deck is indeed stacked), how will Ethan ever be able to not only Davian, but uncover a high-ranking suit in his own organization? And, is there any hope for Julia? The mysterious weapon Davian has stolen from him by Ethan and the gang is a suitcase housing some sort of nuclear weapon nicknamed the 'Rabbit's Foot.' This could've easily been titled, 'Run Tom Run' because Cruise is constantly moving and film briskly follows him. JJ Abrams creates an energy in MI:III very akin to his 'Alias' series where you never know who to trust and the camera never stops moving. The film feels a lot like 'Bourne Supremacy' and is almost as fun. It has one of those endings, though, that doesn't quite match other inspiring action set-pieces such as the remarkable 'attack on the bridge' sequence where Ethan and his crew are being shot at by a jet plane's missiles not to mention helicopter soldiers' machine guns. Also, the Shanghai sequence where Ethan uses a fulcrum to swing himself from one building to another and then parachuting from that building almost being hit by several vehicles is also a masterful highlight. The ending just seems rather uninspired next to those sequences.This film, I'd have to say, is the most entertaining and energetic of the series. The cast is much more lively and the pacing which darts after the characters is almost exhausting.",7,0,0,1 November 2006
Lucky Number Slevin," Slevin
","Two aging gangsters, once partners, have become rivals when Morgan Freeman's son is assassinated. It's thought that Ben Kingsley had it done so Freeman has who he thinks is a bookie named Nick Carter, Josh Hartnett, to murder his son in retaliation to cover an owed debt. Bruce Willis is Mr. Goodkat, a world class assassin who seems to be working for both Freeman and Kingsley..what his chief motivation could be is a mystery at the offset.The key to the whole movie comes in a story Willis tells to an unfortunate who listens intently about a kid's father who borrowed from gangsters 22 grand for a horse bet he heard from his uncle(the specific horse, with an ironic name synonymous with the film, has been shot up with tranquilizers). That father and his wife are assassinated because of the bet, but we're not exactly sure about the boy child.Stanley Tucci portrays a cop keeping a stake-out on both families, quite curious about why Hartnett seems to be in the hip pocket of both Freeman and Kingsley. How Hartnett is able to evade certain death is an unraveling of secrets that'll point out a lot of the mysteries concerning not only Willis' unusual behavior, but the reasoning behind his own.Is Hartnett who he says he is or merely someone completely different than we could possibly perceive? Lucy Liu has an entertaining, but key role as a snooping coroner who falls in love with Hartnett as she tries to 'help' him find out where his old buddy Nick Carter is.You see Hartnett tells Liu that Carter offered him a place to stay after some catastrophic happenings in his life prior to the invite. Liu takes it that Carter has set Hartnett up for disastrous occurrences stemming from unpaid debts. The film plays on that for quite a spell.This film has dialogue too smart for it's own good, but is entertaining to listen to. Everyone talks in riddles and seem to enjoy themselves, though the tone gets quite serious at the end as retribution regarding a past horror story is acted upon. Twists abound and there's violence aplenty. The whole last fifteen minutes consists of back story explaining every aching minute detail regarding the whole film's odd mysteries..almost everyone comes out corrupt, even those you don't think would be behind such murderous deeds. The film's set-up and execution is pretty preposterous, but I couldn't help enjoying it anyway.",6,3,6,2 November 2006
Skyfall," Skyfall
","For me, Skyfall is a marked improvement over the previous (badly titled) Quantum of Solace if just because of how involved M (Judi Dench) is in the overall plot. That and Javier Bardem is just superb as the villain (with more than a strong reason to harbor some real resentment and to be a bit on the loony side) who was once a MI6 agent and knows plenty of secrets that he can use (besides the genius mixed with the madness) to expose the British Secret Service (not only that he actually is responsible for blowing the agency building in London up!) as maybe not as soundly protected or impenetrable as their reputation suggests. Because M is willing to sacrifice her agents if needed to protect her country and government from terrorism and attack, Bardem's former agent, Silva, was tortured and had actually bit into a cyanide pill that didn't kill him but poisoned and 'melted' inside him his mouth (ouch); when he removed his teeth it adds weight to his seething bitterness and hate for M (and the agency he worked for several years). James Bond (Daniel Craig, fit but for a while looking a bit sickly once returned from near death when shot accidentally by a field agent ordered by M to 'take the shot') is on the pursuit, at the beginning, after an assassin who confiscated a list of MI6 agents undercover, traveling through crowded traffic in Turkey. The fight on top of the moving train (and how Craig uses a Cat to get from one motorcar to another) kicks off the movie nicely, but there's a lot of plot that stretches out the action scenes. M's character is on trial (literally) when she must appear before a tribunal of sorts to address the miscues and infiltration of her agency, with Silva actually freeing himself from a cell heavily guarded in an underground bunker of London, crashing a court, and firing away (a slight hesitation allows M to be rescued by her new boss, Mallory (played by Ralph Fiennes) in a fine moment for him, grabbing a gun and helping 007 fend off Silva and a couple of his men). Silva seems to have cyber skills and advantages that even trick MI6's Q (Ben Whishaw) and cause plenty of headaches for the agency; when 007 is taken to an island with a city abandoned by hysterical citizens who believed they would perish, Silva has a building plentiful with computer technology that has raised such havoc around the world, such power at his fingertips (how Bardem describes this and a bit of homoerotic groping on 007 while Bond is bound in a chair are examples of the showy theatrics for which Silva embellishes his villainy) provided much opportunity for him to smack around the morale of a highly renowned British Intelligence Agency. This film sheds light on a new threat that cannot be so easily exposed and recognized when M addresses her judiciary committee and their questions on her agency's mistakes. Regarding the action, there's a nifty fight in a Shanghai high rise (the eye candy night scenes of Shanghai's city lit is quite stunning as is Macau) between Bond and the assassin he battled on the train (how Bond grabs hold to the bottom rail of the elevator, following him up, is cool), Bond's pursuit of Silva after he escapes his cell (the explosion of a wall and how a subway train falls through the collapsed hole nearly smashing Bond is epic) is a real hair-raiser, and the final sequence at Bond's Scottish manor (Silva's men sure lay waste to the place!) has plenty of gunfire and things go kaboom! The Bond girls are perhaps not as memorable as in times past (but still hot)--Naomi Harris is Bond's field partner, responsible for shooting him when M demands she attempt to shoot the assassin (and her shave of Bond's face, not to mention, her last name will make Bond fans smile), while Bérénice Marlohe as Severine, a lady Bond meets while trying to gain introduction to Silva through her, has a steamy shower scene with 007 before her head is used to balance a shotglass of liquor (Silva is punishing her for her little tryst with Bond, purposely missing the glass he could probably have hit with ease)--but have their moments opposite Bond.This is ultimately all about Bond and M contending with Silva who is hellbent on his revenge. There are plenty of inspired homages to the Bond brand such as his gun and car (good joke about an exploding pen when Q and Bond share a conversation about the young and old in the agency), and this movie comments on the vulnerability and age of Bond. This is certainly my favorite of the Craig Bond films. Dench is expertly used and her moments with Craig are a perfect swan song to her M character. Albert Finney, as an old family friend of Bond's, has a marvelous supporting part and helps combat Silva's barrage of bulletfire.",7,2,6,3 May 2013
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter
","I think sometimes what works well in a comic book doesn't necessarily translate effectively on screen. Mostly shot in sepia-toned dreary, saturated tones, Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter becomes beholden to a CGI dependency; like crack to an addict, Hollywood these days can't do without that visual effects fix. Abraham sees his mother fall to vampirism thanks to a rotten slave owner bloodsucker named Jack Barts (Marton Csokas). Barts is associated with New Orleans slave owner (and chief vampire), Adam (Rufus Sewell; he's reached that point where he reeks villainy from every pore, but he's typecast). Adam was responsible for the murder of the wife of vampire hunter, Henry (Dominic Cooper), and so Henry enlists the aid of twentys-year old Abraham (Benjamin Walker; a surprising lack of charisma, but it seems his look was more important in the casting of the role) to help him go after bloodsuckers. While some are good with 'weapons of iron', Honest Abe is better at spinning and wielding a chopping ax. The chopping ax is a character of the film like Abe, and he can sure whip it aroundof course, this ax will be needed drastically if Abe is to survive the bloodsuckers and those extended mouths with all their sharp teeth. Part historical drama, part dark comic horror action, Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter tries to incorporate back story and Civil War elements with those nasty bloodsuckers imitating regular folks. This had me laughing: vampires support the Confederacy because Abe is the enemy of both. You have battle scenes where Confederates have vampires alongside them engaging the enemy. Henry has a secret Abe later learns, but Lincoln follows his orders towards vampires masquerading as commoners, using the ax as his weapon to behead them. Other friends of Lincoln (and eventually help him against his foes) include his first employer (a shop owner), Joshua Speed (Jimmi Simpson) and a slave he saved from the whip, Will Johnson (Anthony Mackie). There's a pivotal scene when Abe goes to rescue Will from Adam in his New Orleans mansion, certain to be the major 'Abe fights the vampires' of the film, as well as, the finale on the train (where Adam is after the silver and we are led to believe Speed has betrayed Lincoln) where wooden tracks are set aflame. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is Mary Todd and her betrothal (and courting with) Abe is given importance; not to mention, their son's attack by Adam's evil henchwoman, Vadoma (Erin Wasson), which will later lead to Mary Todd getting her due justice. The obvious liberties are taken with Lincoln's life prior to his monumental presidency, and how (while President during one of America's most turbulent times in history) he still continues to kill vampires even after he's become President of the United States, but the sheer audacity of such an idea I give applause. Does it work? It is far-fetched and unrealistic but why wouldn't it be? The heavy use of CGI is what left me rather wanting, and the lead actor just never quite leaves a significant impression as Abraham Lincoln, one of the nation's most critical figures of history. Seeing the Union use silver to even the odds at Gettysburg, with vampires in Confederate uniforms meeting their ends, is equal parts amusing and rather thrilling.",6,0,1,8 September 2013
John Wick," John Wick
","I'll say this about John Wick, this sure wasn't boring! The plot set up is ridiculous and laughable. A dog's death--and animal lovers may just get behind this (me realizing this as I write it)--fuels the rage of a former hit-man named John Wick (Keanu Reeves in a role tailor made for him), known to as the man you call to 'kill the boogeyman'. Wick had left behind a trail of dead bodies, a life where he perfected the art of the execution. A man he worked for, a Russian crimelord named Viggo Tarasov (Michael Nyqvist, of the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo series), unfortunately has an entitled punk kid named Josef (Alfie Allen; Game of Thrones) who seems to look for trouble and has been coddled by his pops to the point that he is burdened to clean up his messes. When Josef sees John parked by a gas tank pumping for a 69 Mustang, he wants it and, along with a couple of his crook cronies, home invade Wick, taking the keys of the car and killing his cute pet dog (purchased for John by his dying wife as a parting gift so he wouldn't be all alone). So Wick, furious and seething with rage, will wage a one-man war against any of Viggo's hired thugs and hit men (or hitwoman as one case arises) that gets in his way of executing Josef. Because Josef is such a creep, seeing him narrowly escaping Wick who must destroy an army of Russian henchmen, it is hard to imagine even Viggo would be so inclined as to relinquish so much in favor of saving the piece of human excrement. Yet family means somethinguntil Wick has a grenade gun pointed at him! Viggo hires Willem Dafoe's Marcus to take out Wick, but he instead winds up rescuing him twice from narrow demise. Dafoe, just to tell you, is rather wasted in his role, but with Ian McShane (as the owner of an exclusive hotel for a particularly criminal clientèle), Bridget Moynahan (as the wife who dies from cancer, supposedly 'taken by God because of Wick's life of murder for money'), and John Leguizamo (as the owner of a car shop that seems to operate illegal chop shopping) all make brief appearances as folks Wick encounters or knows. McShane's character has eyes and ears that could very well assist Wick on his journey because rules within his 'Continental' were not met (Adrianne Palicki of the Friday Night Lights television show is a hitwoman who accepts a contract that would urge her to break the code held for anyone within the confines of the hotel to not practice within this 'safe zone') and it was because of Viggo this was usurped. So Wick has friends that will help him on his mission.With plentiful gun violence and lots of John Woo-stylized gunplay within martial arts and hand-to-hand combat, 'John Wick' rarely takes a breath once it gets going. It starts dramatically and once Josef does what he does, the film takes off and remains a body count actioner the rest of the way. With a determined face that has a lot of ticked off aggression barely contained, Reeves recovers some of that old action star mojo that was missing in the big budget flop, '47 Ronin'. The film does absolutely nothing newsimply put, Reeves, with guns, fighting skills, knives, and speed, cuts a swath through a lot of men, leaving a mess of bodies in his wake. I think the first major sequence—in Wick's home when Viggo sends some men to kill him—shows Wick kill about 20 men in like three or four minutes. Oh, just wait until you see him in the Red Circle clubViggo has a lot of bought 'protecting bodyguards' that service the film as gun fodder. Not to let cars go to misuse, we see lots of vehicular carnage where men don't fare well as open targets on foot (or inside the car). It doesn't matter if men are up close or at a distance, Wick can put down targets with relative ease and barely flinch. It is like watching a shoot-em up video game. Wick is a bad ass who drops human targets of all shapes and sizes from all directions. You enter his orbit or within his line of sight (and are an enemy threatening his mission), your ass is grass. If this is of interest to you, check the film out. Don't expect to receive a cerebral dramatic work of artthis ain't it. But Wick will not only shoot you in the eyeball or forehead, he'll make sure to punch you in the larynx or break your arm before doing so.",7,4,16,1 November 2014
Kickboxer," Kickboxer
","This time Jean Claude Van Damme's formidable adversary is a bad dude with a pony tail named Tong Po. He's Taiwan's heavyweight champion and is feared/praised by fight fans as the best. Tong Po makes mincemeat out of American Kickboxing Champion, Eric Sloane(Dennis Alexio), leaving him a paralyzed cripple in a wheelchair, and his brother, Kurt(JCVD)wants revenge. Kurt seeks the assistance of expert master of the martial arts, Xian Chow(the charming Dennis Chan), hoping he will train him to be a great fighter, with the appropriate skills to combat Tong Po. Xian, utilizing Kurt's determination and dedication, molds and develops him into a superior martial artist, but can he withstand the attack of Tong Po? Tong Po's agent, Freddy Li(Ka Ting Lee), uses treacherous antics(..like kidnapping Eric, having Xian's trusty canine stabbed by a dagger, and the rape of Kurt's girlfriend, Mylee(Rochelle Ashana)at the hands of Tong Po)in an attempt to thwart Kurt's chances of defeating his foe due to a lack of focus and concentration, factors needed to properly fight. Freddy Li has made a big bet on Tong Po and informs Kurt that if he is to see his brother alive again he'll throw the bout, but do so while being pummeled by Tong Po. Through the collective efforts of his friends, including Xian and a retired Vietnam vet, Winston(Haskell V Anderson III), perhaps Kurt will be able to fulfill his desire for revenge, while successfully proving that he can be a fighter of superior skill.I feel like many fans of movies regarding kick-boxing will find this a tad disappointing for 'Kickboxer' features precious few fight sequences of real worth. We see Kong Po annihilate Eric in a bout(..before this, Eric himself defeats an American opponent with relative ease, and being a renowned fighter in the USA has grown his ego to epic proportions)establishing the meat of the film's revenge story, but the bulk of 'Kickboxer' has Kurt training with Xian in preparation for Tong Po. We see Kurt and Mylee's blossoming love, along with Freddy Li's shenanigans. The training regimen(..including their work in the fantastic Stone City, an ancient Buddhist temple ruins and around Xian's modest home where he uses natural objects as tools to train Kurt)envelopes a good 50 minutes of the movie. We do see a humorous scene where Xian wishes to challenge Kurt by taking him to a bar, getting him liquored up, and having Freddy Li's young fighters engage him in combat..to the chagrin of Li, Kurt obliterates them in short order, afterward showing that he can barely walk upright! As is often the case with these movies featuring Van Damme(or part of this burgeoning genre of this time when martial arts was starting to take off with western audiences), Tong Po is a muscled and mean force to be reckoned with, an intimidating enemy the hero must overcome through the use of his evolved techniques and physical development. Oftenin these flicks, we see how Xian, the trainer, is able to fashion Kurt mind, body, and soul into a superior fighter. The finale, I think, is sufficiently thrilling as Kurt, at first, must allow Tong Po an advantage, while also remaining distracted due to his brother's whereabouts and discovering Mylee was raped by his opponent. And, just as usual(..we wouldn't expect anything otherwise, would we?)Van Damme gains the upper hand when those encumbrances are lifted and he can take control. 'Kickboxer' is a chance to see Van Damme in full form, landing every type of kick and punch in his arsenal..in slow motion or repeated two or three times to relive the blows as they deplete Tong Po until he's a broken, beaten, and bloody mass, without fight left in him. The martial arts Kurt is learning from Xian is Muay-Thai. I don't think Van Damme has ever looked better than he does here. As normal, JCVD performs the splits numerous times(..this time, there's a scene where his legs are pulled apart by Xian by ropes with sound effects featuring bone cracking).",6,1,1,16 December 2009
Passengers," Passengers
","Ship, carrying 5000 colonists and over 200 crewmembers, encounters meteorite swarm while traveling to a new homeworld causing malfunctions to various operations, awakening engineer Chris Pratt from his hibernation chamber. He realizes that he was awoken way too early: there is still 90 years to go and he is all alone except for an android bartender (played by scene stealing Michael Shannon, who is lit and resembled Joe Turkell (Lloyd) from The Shining (1980) to me)! Walking past the hibernation pod of a writer (Jennifer Lawrence) during a year-long slumber where the absence of human contact is deteriorating his mental state (he nearly shoots himself into space after space-suit visits outside the ship), Pratt contemplates releasing her so he can have companionship with a fellow earthling. While the android bartender is pleasant and gentle-manly enough, it isn't quite the same as having chats and worthwhile contact with someone who feels and thinks as he does. So he rigs Lawrence's pod to make it seems that her awakening was a malfunction, and the two spend the next year getting to know each other, eventually falling in love. But will Lawrence learn of Pratt's releasing her from her hibernation which was meant to take her all the way to homeworld, condemning her to die on the ship? Meanwhile, there are system failures starting to pile up as a significant fire and damage from meteorites at the beginning of the film threaten to destroy the ship. With Laurence Fishburne as a ship officer awakened also from pod failure with a certain type of clearance 'band' (each person on the ship has wrist bands that grant them certain privileges and accesses to areas of the ship and its luxuries) that will help Pratt and Lawrence significantly towards the end of the film.While the plot is as familiar, predictable, and uninventive, the star power is undeniable and the special effects are razzle-dazzle and extraordinary. Lawrence has a fantastic piece of acting in the middle of the film when she realizes Pratt woke her up from hibernation, sentencing her to die on the ship, wrought with rage and heartbreak. Pratt shows his sensitive side with this part, and his initial loneliness is palpably presented where we totally understand why he'd do that to Lawrence even if it is wrong. Fishburne makes the most of a very small part (which wastes him because I wanted so much more time with him), where his worth is basically tied to the band around his wrist and to underlie how the pod's malfunction could seal the fate for someone prematurely released. The gravity malfunction sequences (one where Lawrence is swimming and caught in a large 'water bubble' that nearly drowns her, also lifting Pratt and dropping him hard to the floor, is a knockout) are impressive as is the layout of the ship and the visual tours outside it. I think 'Passengers' is a fun two hours if you want something that fills the screen of a theater and tickles your eyes with its eyepopping special effect/set design candy, but the plot is just not all that extravagant. It is funny (those 'clean-up' robots are a hoot, and Shannon nearly brings a smile to the face every time he appears), sexy (Lawrence and Pratt have some steamy encounters testing the PG-13 rating), thrilling (although the ending is never in doubt, the near-fatal space catastrophe for Pratt when he must go outside the ship to manually open a hatch so that fire can escape, and Lawrence needing to pull a handle when the time is right as the threat of critical failure was imminent prove exciting and suspenseful), romantic (the film gives plenty of time to Lawrence and Pratt to convince us they like each other then gradually fall in love as the ship has its luxuries they take advantage of), and blockbuster big (the effects and sets are the best Hollywood money can buy). Eventually this will probably take up your Blu-ray shelf with other aesthetic sci-fi pleasures, but it doesn't really have enough meat to the bones of its plot to achieve heights beyond popcorn movie status. Pratt and Lawrence are always watchable, and their chemistry helps a great deal...they carry this film along with the sci-fi goodies that Hollywood money provides. Pratt's engineering and creative genius with parts and equipment comes in handy (plot device to make him quite the hero) when the ship goes to hell.

","'This is the best bad idea, sir, we have by far.'Slick Hollywood entertainment from director Ben Affleck (with 'Gone Baby Gone' and now this, Affleck has now cemented his status as a filmmaker to take serious; the guy knows what he's doing) takes a past event (of course, being a Hollywood joint, there's creative license taken for optimum effect) and provides edge-of-your-seat, gulp-in-the-throat suspense. The event was Iranians rising up against the US Embassy after a ruthless Shah received political asylum in the US. Some are kidnapped while six others in the Embassy escaped to the home of the Canadian Ambassador Taylor (Victor Garber), pretending to be guests but not going outside as to give Iranians in the area a sight of them. CIA 'exfiltrationist', Tony Mendez (Affleck) concocts an unusual escape strategy where he hooks up with a Hollywood make-up artist and producer (John Goodman and Alan Arkin) to fool the city of Tehran with this bogus movie project (a science-fiction B-movie called Argo) supposedly to be shot in Iran at popular spots of certain significance. This will be a ruse to provide fake disguises for the six hiding out at Taylor's: members of the movie project, complete with backgrounds and false identities. It seemed highly unlikely that this would work, but it could be the six Americans only hope. I realize this might offend Canadians and Iranians, but 'Argo' felt like a suspensor using events from the Iranian Revolution to craft a nail-biting experience. The CIA gets a ton of support for how this all plays out, but Taylor deserves a great deal of credit because of his help to those six who got out. I think what I believe works so well is how the film takes us into Iran of that time ('79 & '80), with all that unrest and activism, the people taking to the streets with signs and aggression (they were sick and tired and showed it), cars on fire, certain ones being shot in the street, a body hanging from a crane for all to see, and marching crowds protesting about the shah that got away and America's role in that; this is where I think Affleck excels. That and his evocation of the period in Hollywood (love the effort put forth to spotlight the science fiction so popular of the time and the humor towards Hollywood politics) and the dramatics of the inner workings of the CIA are also a treat to see unfold on screen. Cranston (of Breaking Bad fame) has a nice, sizable role as Mendez' superior; he becomes at odds with Tony over 'calling off' the operation, by order of their superiors. Affleck superbly alternates between his activities, the six Embassy Americans in Taylor's home, and the Iranian situation.The final twenty minutes rings every amount of nerve-racking anxiety such a 'get the hell out of this place' situation can providewhat makes this movie such a success is that even though we know the results, the direction still keeps us glued to the events as they transpire (this is a masterful piece of damned good direction by Affleck; kudos to his work here). The trip through a crowd of protesters in a van to get to the bazaar, the walk through the bazaar, the juxtaposition of Cranston trying to get the tickets confirmed while the seven are inside in the airport hoping the reservations are set, the permission to board the plane and the detainment, one of the six speaking to one of the detainee militants in the airport in the native tongue about the movie project, the call to the Production Office in Hollywood, and the boarding of the plane as the military rush to stop it; this is all expertly choreographed by Affleck. One of the best films of 2012 easily. Perhaps its major misfortune is the treatment of Canada as not having as significant a part as the CIA; it has the CIA opting to give Canada a token credit while they remain anonymous for its efforts.",9,1,3,8 September 2013
Point Break," Point Break.
","Look the 5/10 is for the deservedly recognized action adventure stunt sequences which are often quite white knuckle and intensely effective. But what is left: glum Macy's cologne models often either find kinship or oppose each other. No energy or spirit in the performances. And why I love the film this is 'inspired by' is that the action sequences are just part of why it appeals to me. Swayze as Bodhi simply can't be duplicated. Lori Petty as his sis and Keanu Reeves' romantic interest is a cool chick. Gary Busey as Reeves' FBI colleague has hilarious lines, achieves plenty of good will with us, and is supportive / loyal to a fault. Keanu has the look of an action hero even if sometimes his performances are rather lacking in real gusto. Not one cast member besides a welcome Delroy Lindo gives us much at all to enjoy on screen. Ray Winstone just doesn't have a part that plays off his strengths as a customary badass who can blow others off the screen. Edgar Martinez has as much charisma as a sharp rock he climbs up during the 'Eiger Sanction' mountain climbing sequence. Luke Bracey is a pretty boy GQ advertisement model who can stare and emote 'serious and somber thinking man' but it doesn't make us give a rat's ass about him as much as wet panties. The others who follow Martinez serve as body count fodder who fail to complete the 'Ozaki 8' behind their leader. What is damn good are the locations and numerous impactful stunt and action sequences which include cliff-diving, mountain climbing, surfing, an avalanche purposely caused by explosives to damn up a gold mining operation, gunfights, and chases in curvy streets or along dangerous curves around mountains. Waterfalls, large waves, trips out of windows on high rises, snowboarding down snowy, treacherous, mountainous, rocky peaks, and wingsuit flight by the film's anti-heroes all create exhilarating and gulp-in-the-throat sequences of awe; but when the characters must talk and there's a bothersome FBI plot of this extreme sports agent infiltrating (and becoming allured by) a 'wolf pack' gang of criminals needing funding to support their cause the film is rendered dull and cumbersome. With Teresa Palmer (who has went from 'cheerleader pretty' roles to 'edgy pretty' roles) as love interest to Bracey, handcuffed with an underwritten and rather cliché part. The locations are resplendent as are the action sequences which occur on them. Great cinematography and editing boost the film a lot, too. The money spent on the goods deliver. The cast and plot, don't.",5,1,1,19 December 2016
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," X-Men Origins:Wolverine
","When I first read about the one cast as the great Marvel X Men character Wolverine, I asked myself, 'Hugh Jackman? Who's Hugh Jackman?' Once I watched Bryan Singer's X Men for the first time, I needn't bother asking it anymore because not only had Jackson impressed me as the mighty Wolverine, but I can no longer see anyone else in that role but him. That said, his character's self-titled 2009 X Man Origins movie dispenses with worrying about a rich, textured plot, there's merely a series of situations tacked on big budget action sequences. I mean you see the green bleeding all over the place, I was curious as to how much the opening war sequences, merely seconds-only vignettes showing Logan and his brother, Victor Creed(Liev Schreiber)fighting side-by-side against the enemy, actually cost.This film moves an incredibly rapid pace, shooting from scenario to another, barely catching a breath. Logan and Creed decide to join a military leader, William Stryker(Danny Huston)on secret missions for their government..their options are limited considering Creed's homicidal tendencies led to his killing on of their own, Logan with little to do but support his brother. Logan realizes that Stryker is a corrupt sociopath willing to resort to any measures necessary in order to retrieve a type of material, found from a type of meteor which fell to the earth, Adamantian steel which can do wonders for the anatomy of the proper human host who could withstand such abnormal biological change. Logan has moved on with his life, working as a logger within a breathtaking Canadian wilderness, finding a comforting relationship with Kayla Silverfox(Lynn Collins). Meanwhile, Victor is hunting down members of Stryker's former squad, those with specific powers who decided to leave the evil regime. Soon Victor finds Logan's locations, and Kayla appears to have been collateral damage. Stryker appeals to Logan for returning to him, offering a certain surgical procedure which could give him unlimited power, using the Adamantian material to completely change him into an anatomical anomaly. This would give him the power to engage his brother and get revenge..but, what ultimately happens is Logan discovers that Stryker was behind the whole ordeal regarding Kayla, understanding later, when he meets up with old comrades, John Wraith(Will i Am)and Fred Dukes(Kevin Durand)that he is hunting down mutants, deriving their various powers in the goal of creating one type of all powerful soldier, conducting his experiments on an island. Logan will not stop until he finds Stryker, needing the help of a mutant who got away, Gambit, a gambler with remarkable powers like twirling cards which have such force they can send bodies through brick walls..as Logan will find out all too well.While there seems to be plenty of plot, stringing together various other sub-plots including the introduction of Gambit(Taylor Kitsch)and Scott Summers(Tim Pocock), aka Cyclops, the whole movie is essentially 'show us the characters for a moment or two then get to the good stuff'. You get plenty of duals between Creed and Logan, bodies stabbed into and thrown into various large objects. Buildings crumble and / or are blown apart by mutant powers(..awesome scenes include Gambit's incredible use of a cane and Scott's laser eyes sending penetrating beams which tear apart a school building). Danny Huston, as Stryker, shows here how good he can be as a villain, given only just snippets of screen time to work his magic. Dominic Monaghan(..as a mutant whose powers manipulate electrical power, controlling an elevator or sparking light bulbs)and Will i Am(..as a mutant who can move from one distance to another in a flash, actually reminding of The Flash)have nice, if minor, cameos, but Ryan Reynolds is wasted as a swordsman with wicked mad skills at stopping bullets through swift(..to say the least)technical maneuvers..he's quite arrogant and unflappable, but he only appears at the front, replaced at the end by a stuntman. Daniel Henney is Agent Zero, his skills at using guns properly efficient at removing the line of defense when his boss' teams are being shot at..Zero also unflinchingly answers his master's commands without a degree of remorse or guilt regarding who he kills, including an elderly couple who give shelter to Logan. A surprising amount of profanity, I thought, for a Marvels feature rated PG-13, but when Wolverine stabs those who combat him, you rarely, if ever, see blood which was kind of a drag. A major disappointment to me was seeing Stryker's original regime receive such little time together as only one major action sequence, where they seize upon the lair of a militant, features this group. I'm pretty sure Reynolds desired more action than he receives. But, this is Wolverine's show all the way, no doubt, despite the fact that Schrieber's Creed had plenty of 'time to kill.'",6,1,4,28 September 2009
Home Alone," Home Alone
","Home Alone will stand the test of time, methinks. Watching it tonight, I just find it too much fun. Culkin is certainly a bona fide star here, the groundwork laid in his wonderful work opposite John Candy in the John Hughes-directed, Uncle Buck. The plot—as if you didn't know it, right?—has 8-year old Culkin (quite wise beyond his years, if a bit precocious and, at times, mischievous) left accidentally alone while his parents and family go to Paris by plane to visit the father's brother for the Christmas Holidays. He must fend off two cartoonish, oafish burglars (calling themselves the 'wet bandits'!!!) robbing rich suburban houses on his block, their eyes mainly focused on thieving from his family's home. Pesci and Stern are positively hilarious as the not-so-bright thieves, winding up punished by Culkin's vast array of traps laid at the house they so desperately want to rob. There's a lot more to the film than just seeing the bandits fall prey to violent traps set by an intelligent kid; touched on is Culkin's loneliness without his family, dealing with a scary neighbor (Roberts Blossom, who is simply delightful) that has more to him than meets the eye, and a mother's devoted trip back home to her son. Of course, generations of fans will remember Culkin applying aftershave and shrieking and the 'Filthy Animal' footage scaring both Stern and a pizza delivery boy.The visual silhouette trick where Culkin fools Pesci and Stern into believing there was a party taking place is brilliant. Terrific casting, with the likes of Catherine O'Hara and John Heard as the parents, and even the smaller parts (the aforementioned Blossom and John Candy as the leader of a Polka band who offers a rented van ride to O'Hara he and his traveling buddies use to get to a gig in Milwaukee, passing through Chicago on the way), only enhance the whole experience.While the Raison d'être might seem to be Culkin outsmarting dim-witted, numskull burglars—using violence from a Loony Tunes cartoon to do so—there's plenty more to enjoy here. Personally, I think Culkin as the anchor is one of the chief reasons this film remains so timeless and specialit's the perfect example of just-right casting.'This is my house. I have to defend it.' After building up some good will throughout, credibility does go out the window, but this final stand between Culkin and the bandits is so highly memorable, I think it's excusable. Plus, despite what we know would *really* happen if these two actually were shot by bb's from a bb gun, slip on purposely icy steps, get hit in the head with a crowbar, touch a doorknob heated extremely, stepped on a long nail, received an iron to the forehead, tripped (and landed on) hotwheels, get a blow torch flame to the top of the head (!!!), step barefoot first onto ornaments (Yikes!), and take a shot to the face by loaded paint cans(!), part of the fun is to suspend disbelief and take it all in stride. Stern's reaction to the spider (and the iron stamp on his face) is priceless. As is Pesci covered in feathers. Stern trying to hit the spider and instead crushing Pesci's chest only adds to the outrageousness of the final minutes.While I loved and anticipated the finale as a child, with all its Three Stooges violence, I think as an adult, the film prior to this leaves a great deal more of an impression. There's a lot of heart here, accompanying the pain of picking the wrong house to rob and the wrong kid to antagonize. After Blossom bops the bandits in the heads with an ice shovel, the film pretty much tells you it's only a movie. Culkin re-uniting with his parents is the heart-warming ending you could only expect; include especially Blossom re-uniting with his estranged son's family, and there's much to find beyond just two nitwits enduring bodily injury most normal folks would never recover from.",8,0,0,10 December 2013
Cloverfield," Cloverfield
","A party given by Jason(Mike Vogel)to his brother, Rob(Michael Stahl-David)whose moving to Japan for a spell is interrupted when a rampaging monster wreaks havoc on New York City leaving absolute devastation in it's wake, while also 'leaving behind' little creatures to terrorize citizens on foot. Through the use of a camcorder, operated by Rob's best friend Hudson(TJ Miller), we are witness to the monster's attack and how the city appears once it leaves for other areas to destroy. Following the monster's attack on the bridge they're walking, Rob decides to return to find his beloved Beth(Odette Yustman), who sends him a call claiming to have been hurt, with Marlena(Lizzy Caplan), an unfortunate victim attending the party, Lily(Jessica Lucas)a dear friend set up the party, and Hud, taping everything he can.I think the most effective moments are when we witness the aftermath of the monster's rampage with a city crumbling with buildings and cars destroyed. The monster itself didn't really impress me, to tell you the truth, and perhaps should've been left to the imagination. The little creatures which seemed like off-spring from the monster were pretty creepy, especially when they attack our heroes in a subway tunnel. The bridge attack was a bit effective and the the smoke and terror on the faces of those who just witnessed their city attacked rather works. But, to tell you the truth, Spielberg's 'War of the Worlds' was basically made in the same fashion, except for the 'Blair Witch Project' type of 'real footage found' governmental set-up. The city is attacked, we witness the carnage and horrified people, and follow certain protagonists as they try to move to a desired location. I agree with others that the camcorder used is top of the line and takes a licking and keeps on ticking. I do digress..I don't think Hud would follow behind Rob, or Marlena, for that matter. Being best friends is one thing, but returning to find someone that's very possibly dead, Hud wouldn't be criticized if he joined those being evacuated...although, I realize we wouldn't have the 'Cloverfield experience' if that was the case. You can read on this site the numerous factual errors that are looked over in impacting the viewer like Beth's damaged building leaning against another skyscraper or the Statue of Liberty's head. As far as the constant dizzying movement, it didn't bother as much as others, but there were times where I wanted him to hold the damn thing still..I guess we must understand the situation Hud was facing and take it from there.",5,3,6,3 May 2008
Silent Hill," Silent Hill
","Sharon(Jodelle Ferland)is the adopted child of Christopher and Rose Da Silva(Sean Bean & Radha Mitchell). Sharon sleepwalks, and during her 'away period' speaks of a town called Silent Hill. Rose, against her husband's wishes, decides to find Silent Hill and possibly awaken memories Sharon might have of the place. As Rose is driving to the town she spots a girl in the middle of the rode and crashes. When she awakens, Sharon is gone. She sets out to find her but instead finds a sleepy ghost town with no one in sight. Where is Sharon and what is this place? As she searches, Rose uncovers some disturbing creatures at the heart of the town..and this strange woman, Dahlia(Deborah Kara Unger)who tells her about the darkness..perhaps this is a description of what Rose saw before meeting this woman. Christopher, very worried about his wife and daughter, goes to find them and instead drives to a cavalcade of police cars. Officer Thomas Gucci(Kim Coats)takes him into Silent Hill and it looks nothing like the town Rose is inhabiting. Why is this? There's this cop, Cybil Bennett(Laurie Holden), who had seen Rose and Sharon at a gas stop and decides to pull them over to further check them out when Rose decides to make a run for the town instead of the cop ruining her plans for entering Silent Hill. Cybil, after Rose had visited Silent Hill, hand-cuffs her for supposedly harming her missing child. Cybil had a wreck on her motor cycle and as she goes to take Rose back to the town of Brahams nearby, the bridge leading there is gone and there's this massive gap of nothingness. Cybil and Rose are trapped in this place..Silent Hill is a paradox opposite reality. Obviously the key to the paradox is how it was created and who was the creator. Perhaps the answer comes in this young girl deemed a witch by the name of Alessa(who looks identical to Sharon..coincidence?)who was badly harmed by fanatical types..wolves in sheep's' skin. Who can Rose trust? This might determine how she will find Sharon. Rose and Cybil both are nearly killed by the darkness which seems to have all sorts of malformed demons who carry insects at their feet. Anyone who goes near them are viciously killed.Through Thomas, Christopher learns subtle truths about what happened at Silent Hill..the fires that torched a town taking many 'innocents' with quite a few vanishing. Thomas informs Chris that his father owned a barber shop in Silent Hill and was killed. He also lets Chris know fanatics hurt a little girl. He won't divulge everything and Chris tries hard to gain knowledge about what caused the fire and who caused it. And, his search is also for how all of this relates to his little girl. While his search may yield limited results, it's Rose who is facing it head-on in the 'other' Silent Hill. She'll uncover a treasure trove of demented truths about a certain sect who hold up in a sanctuary which is a safe haven from the darkness. Strangely the darkness doesn't harm Dahlia. The sect seems to have a leader, Claudia(Alice Krige..who is creepy), who might or might not be a source of help to Rose. Cybil realizes Rose is legit and releases her from the hand-cuffs. Will Cybil and Rose find Sharon? Is Claudia and her group trustworthy? The sect seems to evoke strong religious beliefs..is this a revelation of fanaticism? Those who are not familiar with the video game may have a hard time sitting through this film..the developing clues and characters that come into the picture might just be trying for the 'unadorned.' This film, at it's core, is about one mother's quest to find her daughter in the heart of a dark world. She will understand the hate that created this world and meet it's creator. The why and how of Silent Hill and it's omnipresent evil are opened to Rose on her quest to find Sharon. As the actress who portrayed the eerie Dahlia, Deborah Kara Unger, describes this film..'It's Alice in Wonderland meets Dante's Inferno.' That's about as accurate description as one could ask for.I think the casting is great particularly Mitchell as the weary mother desperately searching for her child and always in danger against a foe she does not understand. Holden is good, as well, as the officer trying to help her in that quest. Krige is very good as a woman who may or may not be the reason behind the creation of the paradoxical Silent Hill, and Unger is quite interesting as Dahlia, a woman that looks like a haggard street hobo with secrets buried deep claiming Sharon is her daughter. The camera-work has a stunning flow reaching around every corner and following the characters as they uncover disturbing things. The visual effects, especially in the gruesome climax, are state-of-the-art and effective.",8,2,4,22 August 2006
Ocean's Twelve," Ocean's Twelve
","The thefts to build a certain paycheck (with interest) to pay back what Danny Ocean and his crew stole from Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) are not as important in the second film of Soderbergh's 'Ocean Three' as the interactions of the cast (packed with star power in both big and small roles) and the elaborate chicanery the screenplay pulls on the audience (and Vincent Cassel's egotistical, self-assured, bored-in-his-affluence French aristocratic thief, François Toulour, AKA The Night Fox). The Fabergé egg is what Toulour challenges Danny over to determine who is the best among them regarding thievery. Set in Europe, with Danny and company seemingly up against insurmountable odds (there is an eventual imprisonment where the whole team is sitting in a cell together, and The Night Fox actually beats them to a heist after they extend exhaustive efforts to get to the safe), while an intelligent detective (played by Catherine Zeta-Jones) is nipping at their heels on every turn (she is a former flame of Pitt's). This sequel just feels like the band got back together to have a good time, while this popcorn plot of ever-present implausibility ultimately features a twist that pulls the rug on all that we watched the previous 120 minutes. I do think it is questionable to basically jerk us around and stage such complex development just to say it was all for naught because the whole time the eleven had the upper hand on Toulour due to 'an ace in their sleeve' involving someone close to Zeta-Jones (Pitt always seems to offer this aura of confidence, and a Cheshire Cat smile that indicates he has a firm grasp on how his boys will survive their ordeal unscathed). I think the next film fixes what this film lacks: an initiative behind 'the big heist', giving the team a common goal to seek retribution against a foe (Al Pacino, whereas, Garcia was their target in the first film). Still, I'd lie if I didn't admit that the trick involving how Matt Damon succeeds in getting his team out of a jam thanks to a swerve regarding 'the FBI' left me amused, as does Bruce Willis' appearance as it related to a 'Julia Roberts scam'. While Damon and Carl Reiner have spirited moments in the film, the rest of the cast, besides stars Clooney and Pitt (and, especially, Zeta-Jones, who gets the same star treatment), never quite get the same chances to shine as they did in the first, or would in the final film, of the series. The scene between Damon (who so desperately wants to be one of the 'top guys' of the team) and Coltrane, as Clooney and Pitt look on in somewhat closeted embarrassment, in regards to 'absurd poetic jargon', I thought was hilarious. I think, considering all the locations utilized and the names in the production involved, you can see all the money spent...maybe just not as well as it could have been.",6,0,2,12 January 2014
Fast & Furious 6," Fast & Furious 6
","Well, another Fast and Furious, another guaranteed number of fast cars put to great use in the artform of elaborate crashing and explosions. The plot has a maniac named Sam Shaw (Luke Evans) with a group of terrorists who plan to gain access to a chip that, once applied to a specific device, would knock out a power grid of an area of length certain to create a cascading effect that would cripple this said area with unimaginable death and violence. Michelle Rodriguez returns to the franchise as Dom's (Vin Diesel) love interest, Letty. She has no memory of the Dom family and is a part of Sam's crew. The Rock returns again as 'Domestic Security Service' cop, with extreme fighter Gina Carano making her series debut as his partner. They are offering amnesty and freedom to Dom and his gang in order to help them catch Sam and stop him from attaining the chip he desires. What ensues is a tank on a freeway, speedy racecars flying down London streets, a giant attempt to halt the ascent of a massive cargo plane at night, and Dom engaging in a race with Letty for old-time's sake. Seeing Rodriguez and Carano duking it out twice was cool, and the humorous banter between Ludicrous and Tyrese Gibson led to some fine zingers. Of course, Paul Walker's Brian and Dom will have to rescue Jordana Brewster's Mia from captivity, and as often is the case in sequels, members of the crew representing Dom tragically leave the series. But I thought one of the nice additions to the series (in the previous film, Fast Five), Elsa Pataky's Elena is sadly wasted, and having so many characters in one film means the star power must take a somewhat back seat (The Rock gets to flex his pecs and fight this gargantuan behemoth henchman, but his badass cop isn't featured as extensively). Even Walker isn't quite as substantial to the film, although he does sacrifice possible jail time as a fugitive to extradite information 'on the inside' from a low-life drug kingpin associated with Shaw. But he's relegated to behind the wheel avoiding calamity as cars flip towards him. I think that's a good bit of what you see (or sadly, in the case, at night when you have to squint a lot and create a lot in your imagination as visibility is tiresome): cars flipping towards other cars in mid air. That and cars landing on roads, sustaining the usual loss that occurs when metal meets asphalt at high velocity. All the regs from the last installment (Sung Kang and Gal Gadot as the thieves who became a couple and joined Dom's family) show up here to help out Dom and Brian. The end chase with the plane in the dark couldn't match the quality of Fast Five (the tank does add bonus points to the mix but that damned vault was awesome!), and the climatic car crashes that result need to really impact with a big bang. Night chosen for this doesn't help add pizazz to the big bang.",6,2,4,6 September 2014
The Expendables," The Expendables
","Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham(who, truth be told, is the real star of the movie), Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren(the best role he's had in over a decade or so), Randy Couture, and Terry Crews are commandos/mercenaries paid to do the dirty work that goes unreported in the news or media. We see in the opening that they wipe out a bunch of Somalian pirates who were demanding ransom for kidnapped refugees. Eric Roberts slides comfortably into his drug-lord-in-a-fine-tailored-suit role(with a viper grin) with Stone Cold Steve Austin his heavy duty muscle(let's be honest he kicks Stallone's ass in their hand-to-hand combat sequence). David Zayas is the military leader of a 'country in the Gulf' named Vilena who has joined forces(it's a bumpy partnership, however)with Roberts in operating a drug trade using their army to terrorize the locals so that they submit to working in the cocaine fields. Mickey Rourke(who is part of the film just because he's cool)is a former member of Stallone's Expendables group. A subplot has Stallone having to excommunicate Lundgren because he's a junkie who has lost his edge, almost lynching one of the Somalian pirates. Stallone will be enlisted by CIA man Bruce Willis(Arnold Schwartzenegger turns down the job; himself a leader, it seems, of some sort of mercenary group..perhaps a homage to 'Predator', maybe?)to assassinate dictator Zayas(the true target is ex-CIA Roberts)and cripple his army rule. I have two words for this movie:Missed Opportunities. Because Stallone insists on shooting action scenes mostly darkly lit in a jerky camera method, we miss out on what could've been an epic battle between Lundgren and Li. And Austin's fight with Stallone is murky as well because it's shot in a darkened tunnel..what's frustrating here is that Stallone endured severe punishment with Austin while filming the scene. Even more aggravating is the fact that most of the violence with guns and knives are shot in the black of night and shadow or off screen completely--an absolute no-no for blood thirsty action fans who expected RAMBO with a collection of muscleheads. One thing Stallone delivers in spades are plenty of explosions and pyrotechnics at the end. There's also a bad ass sequence where Stallone is flying their fighter plane as Statham fires from the hole of the nose of said plane(later Stallone drops gasoline which Statham ignites a river ramp with plenty of Zayas and Roberts' army sent up in flames). There is a pretty decent car chase as Lundgren(who has betrayed his men in a moment of weakness, paid by Roberts to alleviate his serious threat)attempts to crash Stallone with Li in the back of the truck with a machine gun trying to thwart his efforts. The 'blow sh%t up' mantra is one I often embrace, but in this movie that's all Stallone is successful at. Machine guns fire as does Crews' big ass missile launcher which explodes giant huts with ease sending men hurling in the air. I guess that might be a reason to recommend the movie, what I just mentioned. But you don't get the best out of Li by a long shot, not to mention, Crews or Couture have very little to do until the end. A good portion of the film has Stallone hanging out with Rourke in his bar or Sly and Statham scouting out Vilena. Statham, though, does get to show his stuff on more than one occasion such as when he and Sly must eliminate several soldiers in order to save Zayas' daughter, Giselle Itié, or beating the crap out of the abusive boyfriend(and his basketball buddies)of his former girlfriend, Charisma Carpenter(underused). And Statham's work with Rourke is fun, particularly their knife-to-dart-board duels. Rourke even has one of those emotional scenes where he comments on losing his humanity when he didn't save a suicide victim who leaped from a bridge, mentioning how the 'blood and guts' mercenary business had taken something from him. Maybe a sequel will be in the works which could rectify the mistakes made in this movie..I don't see why not since this flick brought in a bucket load. A fight between Austin and Couture could've been a major highlight(especially since one of them goes up in flames)if you could see the damn thing. Sigh.",6,0,4,27 December 2010
The Polar Express," The Polar Express
","This is certain to be a yuletide classic (if it isn't already) and the magic of digital facial recognition technology along with its startling animation (the train ride, ticket journey carried about by wind, eagle, wolves, and snow, and visit to the North Pole) will undoubtedly lead to a special stature for Polar Express in years to come.The story isn't too bad, either. A child disenchanted with the holiday, losing his belief in Santa needs reassurance and might just get that when a train headed to the North Pole stops by at his house on Christmas Eve. Each kid on this Polar Express have a golden ticket a certain conductor (voiced and is facially recognized by Tom Hanks) will check before when they board the train. An African American girl leaves behind her ticket to take a cup of hot cocoa to a melancholy kid who almost didn't board the train (without the lead kid's pulling the train brake in order to stop the train which was well on its way), and our lead kid loses it...the journey of the ticket is just one of several dazzling highlights of this nicely realized Christmas film. The train's major stop due to caribou and a derailment on ice (not to mention the lead boy's difficult journey on top of the train as the speed brings snow and wind making it hard to see, a hobo helping him along the way, following the conductor and girl to the front of the train) are thrilling, and the whole visit to the North Pole (which includes the elves making sure all the presents are wrapped in a massive red bag and ballooned to a towering Christmas tree to meet up with Santa Claus) is quite a visual dynamo.This is all about dazzling you. It is an experience I imagine needs to be truly seen in a theater in the IMAX format to truly appreciate it. Still on the small screen, Polar Express is nonetheless impressive as a visual feast for the eyes. The sleigh bell is a nice touch in its importance to the lead kid and his newfound respect and belief in the holiday season. I think ultimately, the film is at its best when establishing the theme of embracing the holiday during your youth because eventually you lose it to adulthood.",8,1,2,7 December 2015

Selene awakens after a bomb knocks her and Michael unconscious, inside a cryogenic chamber, someone has freed her, and she soon discovers that it is her daughter, Eve (India Eisely). Dr. Jacob Lane (Stephen Rea) is lead scientist in a corporation called Antigen, the leaders in trying to find a cure (or this is what they tell the public at large) and help to 'cleanse the Earth' of infection. Ultimately, of course, Lane has sinister plans involving a lycans uprising and the downfall of the entire vampire race In little over 78 minutes, Underworld:Awakening is an uninspired action film loaded from start to finish with CGI violence and gore. No heart or soul to speak of and the Selene character, despite the storyline establishing her as a mother trying to protect her daughter, hasn't evolved all that much since the last two movies featuring her. Michael is only in the first minutes (I don't know why this character was practically written out of the series unless the actor had previous commitments), and mentioned here and there in the dialogue, but Awakening is essentially Selene in a war with Rea (who has a son played by Holden-Ried) who has kidnapped 'subject two', daughter Eve for testing which could help discover a cure that stops silver from killing lycans. This is terribly important to Rea for reasons I will not reveal. Basically you get the same kind of attack scenes seen in previous films between werewolves and vampires, Selene right in the middle. The whole movie just goes through the motions, no depth or care given to breathe life into a tired series. I hope Beckinsale decides to hang up the tight leather suit as her character is as tired as the franchise by this point. I think the first two films were fun and had their moments, but there's nothing here I think that cries out as particularly memorable. Even the usual chase scene where lycans pursue Eve, in the back of a van driven by Selene lacks conviction. Selene finds allies in a young vampire male (basically a GQ model) and a human cop (whose wife was turned by a vampire and later killed during the purge), so there's help for her, but this, for the most part, is all about her taking out every foe that crosses her. The CGI werewolves look exactly like cartoons and the vampires (including Charles Dance) lack any real personality. You can easily skip this fourth film and not miss anything.",3,4,5,10 May 2012
Suicide Squad," Suicide Squad
","With nearly 1400 user comments as of this writing, I will just keep it short and sweet: villains like a sniper working for the highest bidder (Will Smith; he loves his little girl, though!), a former psychologist who fell for psychopath Joker (Jared Leto, more cartoonish mad, not immersed in darkness like Heath Ledger was as the character) and was electro-shocked by him which pretty much warped her mental state turning her into a hot, tattooed maniac (Margot Robbie, who stole the film), among others imprisoned and kept under lock and key until a government Pentagon sociopath (Viola Davis, about as cold-blooded as the villains of the movie assembled) urges the military to allow her to use them for missions, covert and to combat the possible Superman that might not hold onto the same values as the *dead* Caped Crusader did.Jon Kinnaman (The Killing) is a badass soldier Davis puts in charge of the Suicide Squad (coined by Smith when acknowledging that the current mission in this movie might lead to their demise), with a device that holds the lives of the villains in his hands (an explosive device is implanted in the bodies). An 'enchantress' was discovered in a religious artifact hidden in a cave by archaeologist (Cara Delevingne), taking over her body. Davis has the witch's heart in a case and wants her to do her bidding, but the enchantress resurrects her brother, placing his soul (from a similar artifact) in common, getting power from him to combat the heart's absence. This plot is just so absurdly silly, that even writing it gives me chuckles. Jai Courtney, of the Divergent movies, is Boomerang, an Aussie safecracker, Jay Hernandez as a gangster with flame as a weapon, Diablo, who has reformed himself after his family was killed during an outburst, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as 'killer croc' (imagine a croc-man), Karen Fukuhara as the awesome swordswoman, Katana, whose blade when it kills folks traps their souls in it (!), and Adam Beach (wasted) as Slipknot round out the cast. Smith, of course, as Deadshot, brings his star power charisma while Margot Robbie blows away everyone on screen as Harley Quinn. Quinn gets the best lines while Smith is clearly a rung above the others, although Kinnaman is no slouch when the two are together (and they are a lot because the plot adversarially pits them against each other). Courtney is fun, but Hernandez (under Day of the Dead facial makeup) is amazing. Damn good cast in search of a better superhero movie. Leto is hyperactive, with tattoos (Damaged in cursive on his forehead) and gold teeth (?!?!), representing a type of manic Mafioso feared by all. Great scene has Margot Robbie proving to Joker she loved him, dropping off into a vat of goo. The smeared mascara, bikini shorts, 'Daddy's Lil Monster' tight shirt, baseball bat, and 'Love/Hate' bullet chamber gun; Harley Quinn is quite a showy part for Robbie. The 'machine' the enchantress whips up with her magic and the monster brother with extending 'arms' that level everything with this branch-like residue, laying waste to all it attacks are massive special effects sequences, a subway station particularly devastated. The enchantress merely grasps folks and transforms them into hideous monsters with faces that 'bubble'. The Diablo fire god opposing Monster T at the end is impressive. Smith proving to Davis and Kinnaman he's a good shot while still in prison is also a highlight. Major problem forced on director Ayer: having to deal with so many characters introduced, as backstories are rushed to get to the mission. Harley Quinn is destined for her own movie.",6,1,2,4 September 2016
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Captain America: The Winter Soldier
","Hydra, a terrorist cell within S.H.I.E.L.D thanks to German scientists (like the malicious Zola whose 'brain' exists within ancient databanks in an old warehouse), supposedly kills Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson) and plans to use a Project Insight (with special aircraft machines equipped with superior weaponry) to annihilate anyone on earth who might threaten to deter their mission of herding humanity into captivity to follow a security rule. This would be to abandon freedom so anyone that might be a detriment to Hydra's plans is targeted for extermination. It will be up to Captain America (Chris Evans, who has made this character his own; this character will define his career for the most part) and former KGB officer, current S.H.I.E.L.D member (that was until Fury was attacked), Natasha Romanoff, the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson, with red hair and toned, athletic body) to stop Hydra. Joining them is former soldier, Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackle), going by Falcon because he has a special device in his backpack that unfolds metallic wings that allow him to fly. Assisting Hydra besides an equipped strike force called S.T.R.I.K.E is a former buddy of Captain's named Bucky (Sebastian Stan), captured by the Germans and built into a supersoldier called The Winter Soldier. With an arsenal of hi-tech weapons (including a computerized metallic arm akin to Captain's shield, explosives, and guns), impressive strength (he is one that can go man to man with Captain America), and fighting prowess (when Captain and the Winter Soldier do battle, neither can get an edge over the other), The Winter Soldier is quite a threat; he's the perfect solution to the pesky Captain America. Within S.H.I.E.L.D, Fury thought he had an ally in Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford; this role a direct departure for the actor), who is a high ranking member within the organization, but is wrong.Pierce is Hydra and believes the solution is to coral the human race into rule. To him, The Winter Soldier is his weapon along with the Insight heliacarriers that will remove future threats to his and Hydra's dream rule.Convoluted plot or no, Captain America: Winter Soldier is an incredible action film and utilized the popular comic book super hero amazingly well. It brings him into this century and wisely incorporates the past and present to flesh out and evolve the character. It also takes a hard look at 'compromising' one's ideals in order to survive in this day and age, with Captain America a throwback to old fashioned heroism, values, integrity, and defense of freedoms long fought and died for. Redford is a kind of example or symbol of corrupt idealism where the use of murder is necessary in order to adopt and secure a control over people, forgoing the moral entanglements that come with eradicating millions in order to achieve a master race of sheep. To stop war, diplomacy isn't the answer, it's removing millions so that the billions under Hydra rule could be part of a brand new future.Anyway, if you just want a comic book action film, this is perfect. You get incredible car chases (Fury's evasive van drive through the city in an attempt to avoid Hydra forces, Captain America and Natasha's first meeting with The Winter Soldier and members of S.T.R.I.K.E), breathtaking fight sequences (Captain's overcoming the strike force in an elevator and battle with The Winter Soldier on board a heliacarrier, and Captain's early fight with Georges St Pierre on board a ship where hostages of S.H.I.E.L.D are held), and eyepopping special effects (Captain's disarming a heliacarrier with his shield, Nick Fury's van withstanding major damage thanks to a protective shield, Captain's feats of strength through the use of his shield by going through windows and moving through the use of running like a locomotive) really provide the audience bang for their buck. A rather complex plot aside, this had something to say along with all the bells and whistles. Marvelous entertainment. The story of the Winter Soldier in relation to Captain's past is also well done. Anthony Mackle gets a plum supporting part while Redford successfully plays against type.",9,1,4,27 March 2015
Rush," Rush
","Ron Howard delivers an adrenaline-high, well-paced, expertly photographed ode to 70s Grand Prix racing, following the thrilling rivalry between calculating, brilliant, but cold and not-quite-ingratiating Austrian, Niki Lauda (Daniel Brühl) and party-hearty, womanizing, handsome buck, James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth). The dueling egos, bravado, swapped barbs rippling with honesty, and incredible talent of both men makes for some high drama. Every cinematic trick (the ways Howard shoots the cars during races and reactions towards all the key dramatic moments, such as Lauda's tormented near-death experience thanks to burns from his car's fire consumption and agonizing hospital recovery and the rainy Japanese final formula race that Hunt narrowly survives to win the world championship) Howard uses to create a marvel of visual power. I think the racing is what many will come to this film for, and that will not disappoint. There's also a pretty damn good story here, too. It's a biopic about racing legends who drove each other to be as good as they could be. Howard knows how to recreate history on film and he carefully avoids the pratfalls that could belie a 70s biopic through cunning editing and avoiding taking Rush away from the track too much. Both leads match their real-life personas, not only looking like them but providing gravitas to these characters to give them dimension. I love fast cars and them racing in competition tugs at my testosterone. Rush would fit perfectly in a double feature with John Frankenheimer's Grand Prix (1966). The rehab and return to racing after the burning for Niki is absolutely harrowing. There's no doubt that Hemsworth is a stud and has the right charisma to portray such a larger-than-life person as James Hunt. Niki's courage and guts after such suffering is quite astonishing. I personally consider Howard's Rush superior filmmaking.",9,2,3,7 September 2014
Predator," Predator
","Along with James Cameron's ALIENS, John McTiernen's PREDATOR has been substantial in influence towards sci-action-horror over the last 20 years. Look at the Sci-fi channel as an example. MANY of their films over the years practically rip off PREDATOR in regards to a group of commandos/soldiers called in to defeat an alien/monster of some kind, falling prey to it one by one. Sure, the locale and creature may change, but PREDATOR's influence is undeniable. I think a major success in regards to PREDATOR is the way the film establishes the military unit under Arnold Schwarzenegger as very dependent and reliable on one another, each has a function within the group and they have been together for a long time. They've survived some pretty difficult situations, know their role quite well, have fundamental skills detriment to their team's success, operate with nerves of steel, and understand the objective. Harsh environments they are accustomed to, and under the command of Arnold, the group work well as a team.But, the enemy they will face is unlike any other and it has weapons and arsenal at it's disposal the group will discover the hard way. Duped into an operation by CIA agent Carl Weathers, Arnold and his men believe they are entering a jungle to rescue hostages, but soon discover that horrifying sight of dead green berets, skinned alive and hanging upside down from trees. After wiping out a camp of Russian and Central American soldiers, Arnold has a shouting match with Weathers over their being double-crossed into an operation that was a lie. But, they must put aside their differences when an alien hunter begins pursuing them, hidden by a cloaking mechanism, using the trees at great height to travel, equipped with a laser that can blow big holes into bodies. It seems that as long as the creature is able evade gunfire, it is almost unstoppable. But, as Arnold soon realizes, the thing can bleed which means it can also die. The rub is being able to slow it down or trap it so that they can shoot it when the creature is in a compromised state.PREDATOR is a film I can watch over and over mainly because the jungle setting is ideal for a sci-fi horror variation on THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME. The idea of an alien hunting humans, collecting skulls as trophies, moving through the jungle undetected until it's prey figure out who they are up against, is so thrilling because of the design(..gear and weaponry)of the Predator. How Arnold accidentally outsmarts the creature(..whose eyesight goes by the heat projected from human bodies)through the use of mud and ingenuity(..how to make traps from the surroundings)is certainly fun to watch. I think that's another credit to the movie..the humans have to depend on their brains to combat this adversary because the creature has superior weaponry. Entertaining, colorful cast of big, hulking macho men such as Jesse Ventura(..he got to fire the mini-gun called 'Old Painless'), Bill Duke(..as the steely-eyed pal of Ventura's who tells Weathers that if he kept on making noise rustling leaves, he'd cut him and leave him to bleed slowly!), and Sonny Landham(..who has a plum role as a quiet expert tracker who fancies himself a proud warrior who decides towards the end to square off with the Predator in an unseen duel which doesn't last too long). The scene where the soldiers fire off rounds of ammo at the Predator barely affecting it at all is quite amusing. There are some dumb decisions made by several members of the group, perhaps out of heated emotion, but overall PREDATOR attains a well-balanced diet of action and horror, with a memorable foe. One question mark I've always had is the casting of Elpidia Carrillo as a female local within the jungle who is taken along as a hostage. It seems she's in the film just so that the cast could feature a female who speaks Spanish.",8,2,5,13 May 2009
Burn After Reading," Burn After Reading
","The Cohens take their movie to Washington, D.C. Their movie concerns a recently unemployed CIA analyst (John Malkovich) with serious anger issues who has developed memoirs of his life/career. He loses the disc which contains this information, and it is discovered by a dopey employee (Brad Pitt) of a gym called HARDBODIES. Pitt notices a lot of CIA jargon, believing this disc contains codes or other private information worth some money, and soon fellow employee Francis McDormand, who has major self-esteem problems, desperately yearning for cosmetic surgeries to repair a body she is ashamed of, is involved. It is really McDormand who urges Pitt (but he needs little more than a nudge) to pursue the moolah, although Malkovich really isn't exactly loaded. Malkovich has a dentist wife (Tilda Swinton), a control freak, who is having an affair with a former member of the Treasury Department (George Clooney). Clooney is married to an author of children's books, always on trips to publicize her works. So this disc, which really isn't anything that special, causes a lot of ruckus. Murder eventually enters the picture along with the blackmail and rampant adulteries. I did find one scene particularly shocking: McDormand is so desperate for a payday she takes the disc to a Russian embassy hoping they will give her money in exchange for supposed American secrets! This is a woman who really wants to change her body image! Pitt might earn some laughs as a ditz, and Clooney soon succumbs to paranoia when he accidentally shoots someone who startles him and notices that there is a mysterious figure following him around—he does soon learn of who this person is, and, as most of the situations in this movie, it's really a misunderstanding that gets far more out of control than need be. I think the best role in the movie goes to Richard Jenkins, the owner of HARDBODIES, who has it bad for McDormand although feelings aren't mutual because she is looking for a bohunk. The film features an assortment of adulteries such as Clooney sleeping with both Swinton and McDormand. Clooney's wife actually has a younger hunk on tour with her. Malkovich gets locked out his home and banking/savings accounts drained by Swinton who really asserts her seriousness about a new relationship with a commitment-phobic Clooney too afraid to confront anyone that would propose a threat to their love affair. J.K. Simmons has a small part as a head honcho in the CIA, bewildered at the events transpiring around Malkovich's disc, often receiving reports from his equally baffled agent. Simmons just wants all of this nonsense to subside, accepting whatever it takes to stop the bleeding. Malkovich, with little real screen time, is a ticking time bomb just on the cusp of erupting, and a character makes the unfortunate mistake of attempting to help McDormand retrieve extra information on the ex-CIA analyst at the wrong time. A lot of characters end up at the wrong place at the wrong time, or make poor decisions which backfire. Although, the ending does show that McDormand might just get her wish..The film is built on reactions from the cast. A variety of f-bombs surface in the dialogue regularly, and how all the characters tie to each other is clever in its execution. It is amazing how avarice so drives everything in the movie...McDormand wanting her surgeries, Cooney needing to feed his lust, Malkovich unable to recover from a humble downgrade from a job he took so much pride in, Swinton only interested in controlling those in her life, Pitt a comic foil in McDormand's obsessive quest for enough cash but himself wanting a little payday for the disc's discovery. Jenkins, bless his heart, tries to appeal to McDormand's good graces and pays a heavy price in doing so, while JK Simmons receives numerous reports at his desk in the CIA about the whole mess, just exasperated by how Osbourne Cox's analyst's *dismissal* has accumulated into such a situation.",7,1,3,24 April 2011
Man of Steel," Man of Steel
","Epic superhero film with Hollywood pulling out all the stops to make this Superman vehicle feel like a overwhelming experience. A city is reduced to rubble as a 'warrior of Krypton', General Zod (Michael Shannon, superb as a steely-eyed and intense force of will), responsible for killing the father of Superman, Jor-El (Russell Crowe, a pillar of integrity) in order to secure the 'codex' (the very essence of a Kryptonian rebirth) so he can obliterate human life on Earth in favor of rebuilding Krypton on the planet through the devastating use of a 'world engine'. The approach in this film is to show snippets of difficult adaptation during Kal-El's childhood with his current life as an adult while the planet is faced with certain extinction by Zod. Zod is never bothered by the moral dilemma of human holocaust because Krypton is all that matters to him. He felt that his leaders on Krypton were responsible for the implosion of his planet and that to begin anew on a brand new world, nothing would keep him from successthat is except Superman. Lots of structural damage and buildings leveled. The city destruction parallels the recent Avengers movie, with a crater-sized spot showing where skyscrapers once stood, as Laurence Fishburn's Daily Planet boss gathers survivors together looking on as Superman tries to rescue them from total annihilation. Smallville doesn't exactly get off easy, either, as the town suffers the impact of Superman doing battle with Zod's number one and a large soldier. Before the film is over both Superman and Zod get their licks in. As you'd expect, a ton of special effects and a lot of money was spent to improve upon Brian Singer's Superman Returns. Krypton gets a face lift, with even creatures included on the planet this go around, as well as, space craft (like Jor-El's spaceship containing his 'consciousness', individual ships that allow Zod's warriors to travel from his main ship to Earth, and the aforementioned world engine that magnetically lifts cars and objects from the ground, driving them back to the ground as a high-powered beam penetrates through the planet) with elaborate designs. The casting is rock solid, from Diane Lane and Kevin Costner as Clark Kent's parents to the smaller roles like Fishburne, Christopher Meloni as a FBI agent who heroically takes a plane into the world engine, to Ayelet Turer as Zod's cold-blooded lead soldier, and Harry Lennix (of the Blacklist) as a top-brass military mind behind attempting to save America from Zod (or Superman, for that matter).I have read some are troubled by Superman having to end Zod and Costner's Jonathan Kent scolding Clark for rescuing his fellow students from drowning in a submerged schoolbus); the former, I don't blame him because Zod would not stop from killing humans in a rage while I can agree with the latter as exposure to who he is doesn't excuse letting kids die by drowning. The twister sequence is positively riveting and heartwrenching. Henry Cavill is a revelation as Supermanheart and soul are dedicated to the character. While Reeve will always be Superman to me, I think Cavill has certainly taken the mantle and ran with it. His face aches when it needs to, with the conflict, anguish, and torment his character endures (along with the integral heroism instilled into his very being by Jor-El also ever-present) all there and accounted for. This is quite an exhilarating ride, but the product placement (Sears & Ihop) is a bit much. There's an obvious message regarding mankind's need to plunder the planet's resources as it pertains to the implosion of Krypton. I'm a little unsure of Amy Adams as Lois; her approach lacks the zip and panache I associate with the character. She's a bit more introspective and reserved, where the character often gnashes teeth with the boss and defies authority a great deal more. Also, the decision in this *reboot* is to have Lois know about Clark right from the beginning, forgoing the implausibility of her not knowing he's Superman like in the past. Anything there are updates on a character (and characters surrounding him) and origin story, backlash/disappointment always results. That's par for the course. Maybe Adams will rub off on me and have me forget prior incarnations of the Lois Lane character. We'll see.",7,8,12,16 November 2013

The Orphanage," The Orphanage
","Laura's(Belén Rueda) beloved HIV positive adopted son, Simón(Roger Príncep) disappears and if she wishes to find him, will have to play a game with the ghosts of children she once knew as a little orphan girl, the victims of a secret tragedy. While those around her consider Laura's quest for the location of her son, through some idea that ghost children know where he's located, a lost cause, she will do whatever it takes to find him. Carlos(Fernando Cayo), a doctor, tries, to no avail, convincing his wife Laura to abandon a foolhardy search that so often yields few answers. Yet, as she pursues Simón's whereabouts, horrifying truths about those children she once knew surface. This film follows Laura through the clues the children leave behind. The setting is at an orphanage, the very one Laura once lived as a child, for which she hoped to raise mentally handicapped kids.I guess the R-rating is for a minor few displays of disturbing images(..such as a key character's facial damage after being hit by a truck, a fingernail removal, & a broken bone protruding from the skin of Laura's leg)which is a shame because this is actually a rather harmless ghost story regarding a woman's endless search for the son she adores. Dogged and determined, despite how others try to convince her that the mission was fleeting, Laura's pursuit brings such an emotional depth to this, and kudos goes to the performance of Rueda as the mother. I think Rueda brings that key mixture of motherly paternal love and warmth definitely needed and it's important that we care about this search..the film hinges on our desire for her being rewarded. Although, the reward she receives may not be the way we would intend it to be, in the traditional sense, but it certainly packs an emotional wallop thanks in part to Rueda. Cayo, as the suffering husband who wishes to find their son, yet soon loses faith of ever finding him, while trying to heal, I think does a good job at pointing out how most of us, looking at the situation from a more grounded realistic view, would probably react to Laura's demand to continue. The film shows the influence of Guillermo del Toro as director Bayona obviously received a few pointers in the style because he has a visual command that beautifully swept me off my feet in how he photographs the film. This will try more impatient viewers because Bayona's film is a slow-burner, building the mystery, as layers are unpeeled. There's a creepy sequence with a medium, trying to find what is plaguing the orphanage, that I thought works really well, summoning the spirit of 'The Changeling'. Other than the orphanage itself, the director makes good use of a lighthouse and beach-front as well.",8,1,2,26 May 2008
Wanted," Wanted
","Weavers were founded to keep the world in order without chaos enlisting assassins to eliminate those whose fates are decided when their names turn up in a code through woven fabric. This started in a monastery, and has since blossomed into a secret society called The Fraternity with the ones assigned to kill their targets equipped with amazing gifts(..such as acute motory functions where they can shoot from amazing distances, with a sense of sight and balance that is abnormal when those with these abilities are given complete training, honing their skills). A mistreated office accountant, Wesley Gibson(James McAvoy)whose numb existence has yielded him nothing to embrace regarding waking up every morning, finds that his father supposedly was a murdered member of The Fraternity. Gibson, who is thrown into a world he's never known, thanks to an uncanny female assassin with stunning abilities to shoot and drive, Fox(Angelina Jolie) informs the poor guy that the man who murdered his father, Cross(Thomas Kretschmann)is hunting him as well. After a shootout in a grocery store floods into the streets between Cross and Fox(..with Gibson finding his way into Fox's car in the most unusual way)ending in a car chase with subsequent damage, Gibson is introduced to Sloan(Morgan Freeman)who fills the lass in on his potential and possible role as a future trained assassin fated to kill the man who ended his supposed father's life. Saying goodbye to the normal life which gave him nothing but distress and misery, Gibson goes through rigorous and exhausting training which tests his willpower, strength & reserve. Ready for his role as an assassin, Gibson will be taken under Fox's wing being tested on the street by killing his first target, always desiring in his heart to kill Cross. But, Gibson has no idea who he's really after as a twist throws his new life into absolute turmoil making discoveries which will certainly have him questioning his choice for accepting his path into The Fraternity.Folks, if you are going into this film expecting something deep and cerebral, you are in for a rude awakening. Logic is completely left on the back-burner and you will have to suspend disbelief..'Wanted' is a ridiculous thrill-ride which wishes to exhilarate you with non-stop action and bloody violence through astonishingly good special effects. The film has characters with superhuman abilities doing impossible things with guns(..and, more importantly, bullets)and cars, their bodies sustaining incredible blows, scrapes, cuts, and bullets. Jolie's Fox drives with one leg while laying on her hood shooting at Cross over her car! Fox actually crashes a car into a moving train in the jaw-dropping derailing sequence where Gibson pursues Cross. Bullets curve when Fox shoots at an incredibly difficult angle with her gun going around a hanging pig hitting the bullseye of a target behind it. In another incredible scene Gibson masters this art where his fired bullet goes around Fox's face with the wind actually moving strands of her hair! Cars completely flip over as assassins shoot their marks in mid-flight. The opening assassin is killed by Cross from an incredible distance. Cross has a specially made bullet with pieces that split apart as it travels before the sharp point goes through the mark's head. Gibson, in the powerhouse finale, goes through a warehouse of weapon-equipped men, even taking their guns from them as he shoots them in the heads. In this sequence, Gibson's gun actually blows through a victims face, after multiple rounds, shooting others through the hole in his head! Rats are used in a most effective way. A twist in the middle of the film completely shifts the entire plot as Gibson makes an astonishing discovery(..concerning Cross and his actual reason for being chosen by The Fraternity) that has him facing unparalleled odds. Jolie, who is a great actress with range who wishes to play multi-faceted characters, is still a born action heroine. Her Fox is quite a character. She's got that sexy and cool that a lot of actresses would love to have but only dream of achieving..she looks great driving a car, shooting folks, and getting out of a hot tub naked. Her opening scene, in the grocery store as Gibson turns around, that defines why she's such a coveted commodity. Fox says little and lets her skills at death-defying feats do the talking. This film wouldn't be near as good without her. I think many will enjoy the development of McAvoy's character who is run through an emotional grind from start to finish, and seeing him toughen as the film continues is rather fun. Freeman's effortless presence and command is here once again. His fate is rather nifty. The film is a smörgåsbord of John Woo, James Bond, & The Matrix..the balletic gun-play, with outrageous and mind-bogglingly performed stunts and action set-pieces, and bloody carnage with bullets penetrating foreheads and torsos. The assassins in this film, mainly Fox, Cross, Gibson & his 'father'(David O'Hara)achieve miraculous deeds while trying to kill their targets. Throw your hands up and just watch the movie without giving the plot much effort. It's popcorn fodder which might just dazzle you, even if you are constantly rolling your eyes at what you are witnessing. The daily activities of poor Gibson are quite amusing, as we see just what kind of misery this guy so wishes to escape. Terence Stamp has an important supporting role as it pertains to Gibson and the father he never knew.",8,2,6,18 July 2008
Salt," Salt
","From the director of PATRIOT GAMES comes this actioner with political intrigue starring Angelina Jolie as CIA agent Evelyn Salt, who may just be a Russian mole well trained to instigate the downfall of the United States through the murder of the Russian President. On the run, and seeking to find her husband, a spider specialist(whose ties to North Korea come in handy in both rescuing Salt, but helping her invade the enemy's country for intelligence), Mike Krause(August Diehl), we see that Salt might just be the mole agent Peabody(Chiwetel Ejiofor)fears she is when Evelyn orchestrates the supposed murder of Russian President Mayveyev(Olek Krupa)attending the funeral of America's Vice President. Salt is a Princeton graduate with training in all forms of intelligence and combat. Is Salt a Russian spy? If so, has she seen the error of her ways? The finale could have Salt involved in the assassination of the US President!Set aside the unbelievable plot, you really can not take it with a grain of salt(pun intended)as Salt leaps from bridges to the top of a moving truck, then from another moving truck to yet a third! In this jaw dropping action sequence has CIA and police attempting to chase her down(of course, failing to do so)in order to see if she is in fact the mole. Liev Schreiber is CIA agent Ted Winter, Salt's boss, who has a hard time accepting that Salt could be a mole. You have the incredible escape to New York City as mentioned above(see how Salt hops on a motorcycle to evade her pursuers inside a lot of traffic, not to mention how she escapes from her apartment on the outside of the building walking across small ledges)topped by the amazing razzle dazzle after being captured, handcuffed, placed inside a cop truck to be escorted to prison, again able to get away thanks to a taser(you just have to see how she uses this weapon to force a subdued cop driver into pressing the accelerator to move the vehicle, finishing with a death defying plunge from a bridge into parked cars below), soon meeting up with her old teacher, Vassily Orlov(Daniel Olbrychski), who was actually responsible for blowing her cover(this odd occurrence which sets everything in motion is later explained in more detail). Why would Orlov expose his pupil to her superiors? I will not give away a twist identifying a second mole, but it does give meaning to Orlov's opening scene in the CIA interrogation room. There's also the conclusion taking place in the White House as we truly see where Salt's loyalties reside. The fate of the Russian President and the attempt to kill the US President both play a hand into the horrifying possibility of nuclear war, which builds the suspense at the end as we see Salt move past numerous Secret agents heading towards the 'war room'. I can see why many compared SALT to a Bourne movie, just as directed by someone like Philip Noyce whose past films(such as PATRIOT GAMES & CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER)revolved around DC and the political spectrum. Jolie is equipped with phenomenal fighting abilities, she can take down anyone in her path. Her identity is mysterious, we are held in the dark in regards to her motivations, but we certainly see the damage Salt is capable of. Everything hinges on Salt's feelings for her husband, and his fate is what will push her towards her ultimate destination.",7,4,9,4 August 2010
We're the Millers," We're the Millers
","Ridiculous comedy has this assemblage of characters, from differing walks of life ('cute, homeless gutterpunk' Emma Roberts, 'super-hot cheap stripper' Jennifer Anniston, 'late-thirties dope dealing low-life with a keen sense of raunchy wit' Jason Sudeikis, and 'clueless next-door neighbor who is harmless and innocuous' Will Poulter) together by a drug dealer needing to drive through Mexican border to attain a 'smidge' of weed for a loathsome affluent scumbag businessman (played with that pearly-white smile that offers a degree of ease but hides a sinister intent and double-crossing white collar creep just waiting to break free, played by Ed Helms), stolen from a real dealer soon to pursue them for the taken cargo. The film has this absurd 'if it could go bad, it does with some degree provide good as a result' constant to it, as there are a number of 'events' that plague the 'Millers' like a very bad spider bite, a very classic striptease needed to stave off an execution, the 'weed baby' named Lebron, the family kiss caught by a girl Poulter's Kenny adores that is seen as highly improper, how drugs are stolen by a gang that was about to abuse Roberts with Poulter encouraging Sudeikis to intervene, a potential 'couples exchange' in a tent that must be diverted, an intense ordeal where it appears that the border patrol might be on the verge of searching the RV of the Millers with thankful assistance on their behalf by illegals trying to cross, and a needful male blowjob to a Mexican cop in order to escape possible prison time. This is a comedy loaded with foul language and raunchy humor but this cast is a marveltheir chemistry is swell and it helps when their banter causes back-and-forth swapped insults and growing affection. I loved Roberts in this and Poulter stole every moment he's in. Sudeikis and Anniston share a peachy connection that makes even their harshest comments to each other bubble energetically. Anniston's striptease is an obvious highlight and her body has never looked more delectable. The kiss between Anniston, Poulter, and Roberts is cute and makes for the most unusual of family bonding time. Roberts 'scolding' by Anniston and Sudeikis over a carnival worker with 'No Ragrets' tattooed on his chest is another key scene in family bonding. The plot is far-fetched, to say the least, but the cast just make this damn thing purr.",7,1,1,6 September 2014
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters
","Well, good ole Hollywood takes another Grimm dark fairy tale and loads with bloated CGI effects and action set pieces. Want to see Hansel and Gretel (Jeremy Renner and Gemmer Arterton) using heavy artillery to massacre witches? Here is the perfect entertainment for you. Their parents taken from them violently as a children thanks to those evil witches (headed by a particularly loathsome but still quite attractive Famke Janssen, having too much fun when her pretty face is featured; but most of the time it's a CGI hideous visage), Hansel and Gretel have grown into hunters packing a lot of heat (the kind of machine guns, crossbows, and unfolding shotguns modified to look medieval even if they clash with the period this film is set). Hansel has a 'condition' thanks to a witch's curse through a 'candy poison' that requires him to inject a serum to keep him well (if he doesn't, he dies) when a timer on his arm goes off. Meanwhile, a white witch falls head over heels for Hansel, a giant troll defends and protects Gretel when she needs it the most, and Hansel and Gretel's 'biggest fan' (he has followed their work, and his hero worship is enthusiastic, to say the least) ends up helping them take down their main nemesis as she is riding her broom furiously away from them through the woods (she's quite a driver, missing the branches and trees throughout). There's even a Gatling gun that makes an appearance, with the white witch just firing away at Hansel's urging, ruining a major blood moon Sabbath ritual with Gretel meant to lose her heart to the evil witches, with little chained kids also expected to be sacrificed as well. You even get Matrix stylized 'freeze action' and lots of CGI bloodshed (the troll wipes out a very nasty group of villagers pummeling Gretel, using its massive fists as bludgeoning tools and a large tree as a weapon also). When witches aren't being blown away, trees endure Predator like destruction. The woods are not safe as long as the hunters and their prey are loose. Thanks to CGI, the witches are all kinds of ugly, their faces and eyes grotesque, as foul as their behavior. I'm surprised the talent involved in this rather disposable medieval action flick that really does take a giant crap on the childhood story written particularly to give us the chills. All the gunplay and martial arts (yes, the witches seem to possess the fighting skills of Jason Bourne) really are absurd. All the money wasted on this; sheesh.",3,1,2,6 August 2015
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation
","The franchise starring Tom Cruise and a solid cast of characters doesn't let off the accelerator, this time featuring his IMF team 'gone rogue', with Alec Baldwin as a CIA head using his clout to get the government to 'dissolve' (dismantle) the team because of their supposed recklessness. That 'their luck has run out' with Jeremy Renner unable to convince his superiors to reconsider. While out in London, Ethan Hunt (Cruise) meets a new nemesis in the form of an 'anti-IMF' using terrorism to 'prepare a revolution', with different points across the globe to ignite chaos through violence. Lane (Sean Harris, pompously insidious) is in charge of this 'The Syndicate', using a 'former British MI8' (Rebecca Ferguson, who is sensational) as a means to get close to Hunt, hoping to secure a flash drive containing unlimited monetary funds to support his global terrorist agenda. During the film, it seems Lane is always one step ahead of Hunt, but can our hero turn the tables on this new brilliant enemy?Stunts and action are as spirited and lively as any of the franchise, including an incredible car-motorcycle chase through the streets of Casablanca/Morroco, including Hunt (who had just been resuscitated back from the dead after nearly drowning!) having to back his vehicle out of an alley enduring its flipping multiple times as Simon Pegg's computer whiz Benji freaks out (rightfully so!) in the passenger seat. There's the incredible underwater safe sequence (made famous in the advertisements with Cruise leaping into the pressurized vortex that leads to it), opening plane sequence where Cruise hangs from a door while it takes off (to free a cargo of nuclear missiles in possession of terrorists), interrogation cell escape fight (where Ferguson shows her stuff), and Vienna Opera backstage (and above stage!) assassination attempt on the Chancelor of Austria where Hunt must try and thwart multiple Syndicate members from shooting him. The plot is twisty and slippery, with the hero and villain having to play the usual cat and mouse games, with lives on the line. Benji is eventually kidnapped and used as a pawn by Lane. Ferguson is the wild card, abandoned by her country as the MI8 head leaves her out to dry when she secures the flash drive from the water vault. Cruise and Ferguson are really good together, show nice chemistry, and have plenty of cool united fight scenes and shootouts together. Not only are the two physically impressive but their flow when battling the bad guys is smoothly performed. Also the complications of what they are both going through, with their respected governments disavowing them, gives them a chance to show their acting chops as well. Also fascinating is seeing how Ferguson teeters between helping Hunt and maintaining an 'alliance' with Lane. It is a razor's edge poor Ferguson must endure, while Hunt continues to believe in her. Ferguson's knife fight with Lane's chief heavy in a tunnel of London is badass.It is hard not to look at MI franchise as an alternative to James Bond, but I love knowing I exist in a time when both can thrive. Cruise is as big a movie star as ever. Renner, Rhames, and Pegg meeting up with Cruise as the CIA are breathing down their necks is a cool 'come together' moment where the IMF decide to tackle a difficult adversary with all they have at their disposal. Full throttle pace and plot that doesn't let up. Superior summer entertainment.",9,0,4,30 August 2015
Cross of Iron," Cross of Iron
","Hauptmann Stransky(Maximilian Scell) badly wants that iron cross. Steiner(Coburn, battling that German accent, but I still liked him in the part and felt he fit the role well), a veritable war hero respected by many, has one and stands in the way of Stransky getting just that. Stransky claims he lead his accompaniment bravely into battle(of course, he's lying through his teeth), but many men around him, especially Steiner know different. As Steiner and his men are at their posts as the Germans retreat, Stransky doesn't inform them leaving the soldiers for dead. Though, as we have already established in several war scenes, Steiner is able to escape certain death from Russian tanks and foot-soldier gun-fire. He still stands in the way of Steiner getting that cross as he courageously(and intelligently)leads his men through rough terrain and possible death to get back to a German outpost in a nearby village.Sluggish pacing, at times, makes this film a chore to sit through..it really felt a lot longer to me than it was. Still, the film has thrilling war sequences sprinkled throughout, Steiner men's voyage across war-ravaged Russia is indeed quite interesting and harrowing, the camaraderie between Steiner and his men is refreshing and realistic, and seeing Steiner and his men outsmarting the Russian forces through cunning ways of quick escape is suspenseful and quite entertaining.Ultimately, seeing what Steiner and his men go through on their difficult journey makes the impending tragedy even more jolting. I felt the film is a bit sloppy and uneven, but has enough compelling elements(such as Steiner's seeing visions of his beloved soldiers' faces during good times once they are dead;the Russian kid that gets it by his own people;war-ravaged country-side and the dead lying all throughout)to keep the interest of Peckinpah faithful.",7,2,3,12 December 2006
Goon," Goon
","Seann William Scott is actually--I can't believe I'm writing this--endearing (!) as a simple-minded bouncer who finds his happy place as a 'goon' (the member of the team who beats the hell out of people and protects the star) on a struggling (this is being kind) hockey team trying to just win a game. The star of the team is the disgraced Xavier LaFlamme(Marc-André Grondin), so low that he spits on his team's logo out of disgust. Xavier shares a room with Scott's Doug Glatt, and he makes no bones that he doesn't like him. But because Doug harbors no ill will, has a big lug of a heart, and ingratiates himself to his team and Xavier, this dislike might just subside. The film's key story arc--besides Doug's budding romance with Eve (Alison Pill)--is the comparisons between Doug and soon-to-be-retiring thuggish warrior, Rhea (Liev Schrieber), both on teams fighting to get into the playoffs. Rhea has been celebrated as the tough, intimidating fighter with limited hockey skills but featuring a ruthless aggression that most hockey players care to avoid, with Doug considered his 'replacement'. Rhea knows that he must put Doug in his place, but he realizes that Platt isn't some self-absorbed, conceited showoff, but a true, dye-in-the-wool team player who puts his men above himself. Also Doug isn't the monster off the hockey rink he is on; in fact, Doug is a sweet-natured, mental-intellect-of-a-child, gentle soul who uses his fists and body to protect and win for his team, no matter how limited a capacity his skills might be. He becomes the heart and soul of his team while Xavier is clearly the gifted, talented hockey player needing that motivational shot-in-the-arm Doug provides just because of his team spirit. This is a brutal, fight-heavy, battered faces, bloodthirsty, exciting, fast-moving, no-guts-no-glory, profane, spirited hockey movie. It's kickass. If you like lots of scenes where Seann's face takes a licking, swells, with bruises and larges cuts, while he sends his opponents off the rink in stretchers (after bashing their faces in), then this is for you. Schrieber is an absolute badass as the taunting heckler who backs up his remarks to opposing teams by shutting faces by sending players into unconsciousness. His closing battle with Seann is visceral and thrilling. My favorite scene--Seann stops a puck from entering the goal with his face while a rival player comes down on his ankle with a skate blade (ouch!). Jay Baruchel has a sizable supporting part as Seann's potty-mouthed buddy, often recording the hockey games and making rather obscene comments that cause the parents of Glatt (including Eugene Levy, toning down his comedy for a rather serious part as a father who is concerned for his son's safety and career) to groan/frown.",7,1,1,21 June 2013
Now You See Me," Now You See Me
","Slick Hollywood entertainment doesn't do a hell of a lot with its cast members that portray the magicians (Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher, and Dave Franco), but it allows for some wowser, jawdroppingly meticulous, pull-the-wool-over-the-eyes stunts that make asses out of the FBI, an insurance company's filthy rich CEO (Matthew Caine), and even a 'magic debunk media specialist' (Morgan Freeman), all with massive egos that get deflated. Mark Ruffalo does disheveled, downtrodden, down-on-his-luck characters especially well, here portraying a FBI agent in need of a break as it seems the magicians are always pulling a fast one over him. His French Interpol agent partner, played by Mélanie Laurent (fabulous actress from QT's Inglorious Basterds), seems to know a lot about magic and could be another part of the 'grand design'. This is one of those films with a twist that is most certain to leave a 'you gotta be kidding me' feeling. It is a hard pill to swallow. The film, as explained throughout by Freeman, allows us to see how our magicians orchestrate the theft of large sums of money and how they are used to help those in need or to just as punishment for a specific reason determined later. Freeman's gloating at the expense of the agents trying to catch the magicians and later looking at a face behind a jail cell is rather fitting for such a condescending geniusseeing himself duped has a poetic justice to it. Eisenberg, Harrelson, Fisher, and Franco are often devices instead of characters fully fleshed, besides a few moments of repartee and traded pokes at each other, which is a shame because they are all strong talents in need of a better film. This instead is all about a screenplay that wants to amaze through its elaborate plot using 'misdirection' than truly developing characters we care about. Caine's CEO losing money on stage with the very magicians he is managing has quite a bit of amusing irony. Could all of this really happen? It's beautifully designed rubbish for our enjoyment. Turn the brain off, folks.",5,0,1,10 January 2015
Saw III," Live or die. Make your choice
","Jigsaw John(Tobin Bell)and his protégé Amanda(Shawnee Smith)are up to their old tricks, but in this third film(and my favorite of the series)there are some surprises I didn't see coming. On 'trial' is Jeff(Angus Macfadyen, who is blessed with a face and talent that can express all sorts of emotion), an emotionally unstable man, full of booze, wrath & pain, consumingly overwhelmed by the loss of his son in a car crash. The driver responsible was released shortly after thanks to a hasty trial with pretty much a slap on the wrist that might change a many of us who might have this same type of bitterness and rage if it happened to us(or, at least I put myself in his shoes). The other important character in Jigsaw and Amanda's new game is a female doctor named Lynn(Bahar Soomekh, another really great choice for the film..this film is a success in my eyes because the casting excels)who might be able to prolong his life among other things.Jeff must complete a series of games in less than two hours or face being shut inside the building. Each game consists of those certain people who played intricate roles in or around his son's demise(the woman who, instead of assisting Jeff as he held his dying son, drove off;the judge who gave the murderer a slap on the wrist;the killer himself). Jeff has their lives in his hands. He can forgive or let them perish in Jigsaw and Amanda's crafted killing apparatuses. Meanwhile, Lynn has a metal collar, with chambered bullets, that is linked to Jigsaw's heart-rate. Her duty is to not let him die or else the bullets will fire right into her face. Also important is Amanda's role(what she does know and doesn't know..Jigsaw has prepared this whole game for a major purpose to be determined)in the grand scheme of things. She will determine the outcome just as much as Jeff..and not even know it! The film does lots of things this go-around, delving into how Amanda formed her partnership with Jigsaw, the loose ends untied from the second film regarding Eric(Donnie Wahlberg)will be finalized, and we actually see how Jigsaw prepared the test of the two male characters in the first film. These 'flashbacks' regarding Amanda are crucial to the development of the film and it's climax. Like the previous two films, this one works off of some coincidences provided by a screenplay that needs certain characters to die(or suffer)at the right moment before they can be saved, or a certain character saved who just happens to be in a specific place to be shot by a shotgun. I'm not convinced anyone could put together such elaborately designed games without something going awry, but this like the other two is orchestrated by a screenplay writer with devious intentions for his created characters. We see that Amanda has created games that give those tested no way to survive which is not Jigsaw's method. This film is also the most grisly and gruesome of the three showing one unfortunate victim(caught in Jigsaw's favorite contraption, 'The Twister') having his arms, legs, and head completely twisted around as bones snap out of the skin like broken wood. The ultimate goal of Jigsaw is choices and forgiveness. Can Jeff make the right choice and forgive those who have caused him so much agony? There are many who might be able to pick this apart with a fined tooth comb, but I just enjoyed it despite acknowledging that no one is that skillful enough to get away with what the film's death-geniuses do.",8,0,3,24 January 2007
Alien vs. Predator," Alien vs. Predator
","Humans find themselves in an underground pyramid in Antarctica(designed by the 'first civilization' at the specifications of an alien warrior race), caught between two warring alien races duking it out for supremacy with walls constantly opening and closing, the labyrinthine chambers making things quite difficult for those unfortunates trying to find a way out. There was a power source picked up by the satellite of a robotics megalomaniac emanating from the pyramid underneath the ice of Antarctica which inspires gazillionaire Weyland(Lance Henriksen) to assemble a team to find a way to make it inside, claiming it as a major discovery certain to achieve renown and fame. What they do not bargain for is to be stuck in the pyramid as the Predator warriors and alien xenomorphs attack each other to the death. Most of the humans are assaulted by face huggers and injected by mouth with xenomorph fetuses(a flaw in the story has the birthing cycle way too fast). Essentially the film is about a human group servicing the threadbare comic book plot as fodder for the Predator and xenomorph aliens. The film had to have human characters to discuss the plot, like an archaeologist and his aid who can interpret hieroglyphics to explain how the pyramid was built and for what reason. Director/writer Paul WS Anderson builds a mythology for the Predator alien warriors and how far they go back. 20th Century Fox sure threw a lot of money at the movie, providing Anderson with a budget for some pretty impressive, elaborate special effects and he does give the audience some legitimate combat scenes between the Predators and the xenomorphs. Where the movie fails is in how the humans are used in the film, and their demises are mostly off screen. Sanaa Lathan does what she can in the heroine role as an expert climber hired by Henriksen(whose millionaire is dying and sucking oxygen from a device)who finds herself choosing sides with a Predator warrior, hoping he will not kill(and possibly even protect)her. Raoul Bova is an archaeologist, Sebastian, with Ewen Bremner as chemist, Miller. Colin Salmon(RESIDENT EVIL)shows up in a minor role as Henriksen's body guard, and the one responsible for getting the crew into their predicament by removing the last gun from a crypt made especially for the Predator warrior. Everyone else in the plot comes and goes when the aliens enter the picture and the pyramid shuts them in. The acid blood of the xenomorphs are used in interesting ways, even as a mark of success when they are killed by their adversaries. You get an alien queen, trapped in a spider-like locking device, getting free thanks to her 'children' using her acid blood to break the locks. Seeing Lathan running alongside a Predator warrior seems unusual to say the least. Henriksen, while good in his limited time on screen, is cast in a glorified cameo thanks in part to his Bishop role in the ALIEN series. Made for a younger audience, there's minimal graphic violence or course language which might be a no-no for fans of the PREDATOR & ALIEN series. The Predator body armor and weaponry are really cool and seeing them in battle with xenomorphs provide some exciting moments. But, AVP isn't exactly a work of art, but as he always does, Anderson sure makes a good-looking sci-fi movie--this is basically a B-movie, not really all that innovative story-wise, concerned more with special effects and creature fights. It will all come down to what the viewer is looking for. Characters and story, nope. Space ships, aliens, and a imaginative Indiana Jones-style setting, yep.",6,1,5,10 January 2011
Batman Begins," Batman Begins
","While I wasn't totally blown away by Nolan and Bale's interpretation of how 'it all began', I think it has its moments. Despite a busy plot where the League of Shadows adopt a broken Bruce Wayne, needing guidance and a path to a better him, train him in martial arts and how to engage, out- think, and outwit the enemy, and attempt to invest their philosophy on annihilating injustice (through whatever means necessary) among other things (dealing with Rutger Hauer's managing of his company, working in weapons which might not have been Pops Wayne's desired property in the business; trying to recover his shaky relationship with Holmes' assistant DA; building his crime-fighting lair, costume, weapons behind the symbol of the bat, what he fears the most due to being trapped in a well as a child; contending with a mind altering drug being used by Cilian Murphy's crazed attorney (he's the scarecrow villain); trying to recuperate from the loss of his parents and the nature of having to live up to his father's honored reputation; learning how to be the kind of crimefighter his father would be proud of...), I think there are distinctive personalities that work. Michael Caine as Alfred (never giving up on Bruce), the butler who has kept his affairs in order, Hauer as the company's chief operating executive in the company (with an obvious interest in attaining power in the company), Morgan Freeman as an old company employee in charge of a section of the company that dealt in 'abandoned weapons designs' (Bruce's go-to guy for kevlar, the elaborately designed batmobile, among other things), and Murphy (the devious, cold- bloodedness is brought out well; that and he plays a prick, douchebag authentically) all bring it even if Katie Holmes (a target of undeserved vitriol) doesn't quite achieve what the part really needed, and Bale, while brooding and providing enough angst and inner anguish, speaks in that dark tone that has been quite the victim of mockery. Liam Neeson, as Bruce's mentor and adversary, is a bit stone-faced and delivers his lines as a man rooted in his philosophy to the point that when he talks about genocide to an entire city it feels like little more than crushing out ants. The action scenes are sparse, but not altogether satisfying to me. They don't have the pizazz I was accustomed to with Burton. The police chasing Batman in the batmobile, and the effects of the toxin on people, to me, are the film's best moments. Gary Oldman plays it straight in a part that he's seldom seen in...a straight-arrow cop totally in favor of justice. He plays the character with valor all the way. This isn't Romeo is Bleeding Oldman, for sure. Tom Wilkinson even shows up as a gangster running the criminal underground, victim of Murphy's toxin when he threatens to expose the plan to poison the city's water supply. A ton of faces, a lot of subplots eventually converging, and Bruce's developing into Batman: there's no way around a lengthy movie. Holmes, if anything, suffers from not having the right chemistry with Bale, but it works both ways. She just lacks this passion and energy the part kind of needs.",7,2,4,22 July 2015
Before Sunset," Before Sunset
","I think those of us in our thirties will really respond to BEFORE SUNSET as we did to BEFORE SUNRISE when we were twenty. I think those in my age group will have a special place for these two movies because they fell within our time, as if a voice speaking for us. But, ultimately, the idea of unrequited love is universal—how many of us truly loved this certain someone, that first true love, only to find ourselves married or linked to another, although we will forever remember that girl/boy who got away? My heart both melted and warmed as I revisited BEFORE SUNSET since I first watched it back when I was a little younger in 2005, still in my twenties, but approaching my thirties. However, in 1995, when BEFORE SUNRISE was made, I was so young, a teenager with the future ahead of me(in essence, two years later I'd be married, and the next 12 work in a factory, before losing that job gave way to a possible brighter future)and so the plot of two people, an American young man touring Europe, running into, by chance(or dare I say it—gulp—fate )a lovely Parisian woman, the two sparking conversation, before remaining together throughout the day and night, falling in love in the process. I secretly am a romantic at heart—although that side of me is often hidden away—and so BEFORE SUNRISE & BEFORE SUNSET have a way of really reaching me, holding me in their grip, and I hate when those movies end. It's nearly improbable, the idea that two people who would never meet in Vienna, find each other in Paris as Ethan Hawke has written his experiences with Julie Delpy in a novella which is a success. They pick up right where they left off, with relationship problems(he is unhappy in his marriage, probably because his wife is not Delpy, and she can not find a substitute for Hawke), discussing intimately details which have accumulated over the last nine years since the last time they saw each other. It starts with small talk and eventually both admit and confront the disappointments of being apart and never recovering from that moment in their lives which forever remains with them. And, Paris is the backdrop, the two walking and chatting, as if one 80 minute long take, quite an impressive feat for director Linklater who allows us to partake in their reunion.I have equal feelings frustration, joy, and sadness, when I watch these two movies because I want them together and feel like life so often is like this..those who truly should be together aren't, while so many marriages are so unfulfilled because the love that is obvious between Hawke and Delpy so often doesn't exist in a formalized union, a format which is conducted and composed. I'm frustrated because I never communicated my love for the girl I deeply cared for and admired, never even having that moment that Hawke and Delpy have in spades. At least they had this one night, the pain of nothing more than that thrives during the entire running time for BEFORE SUNSET. I think the most telling and wonderful moment was Delpy's song, 'The Waltz', succumbed to Hawke's pleas for her to sing to him with her guitar—it is about him and her feelings of that night and how it continues on, I could only smile, with tears, because it just reiterates to me how life is unfair and how love isn't always meant to be. Am I the only one who sympathizes with Hawke who stares at her forlornly, not wanting to leave her apartment even though his flight is upcoming? I think it's safe to say that he wants this time together, this day to never end. I'm glad Linklater doesn't allow us to see them separate. Delpy, I just adore her in this movie. When she hugs Hawke, I'm overcome with a sense of depression, mixed with comfort that at least she gets to embrace the man she will always love, her one true love that no other man will be able to replace, yet grieve in my very soul that for nine years they haven't been able to do so due to mistakes and missed opportunities. Both actors really give us rich characterizations, ad-libbing some of their dialogue, I figure, yet creating two very elaborate, distinct people. I remember thinking a few years ago that BEFORE SUNRISE as a whole is the equivalent of those scenes in average Hollywood rom-coms where music overlaps what two people are saying to each other as they hang out and spend time together, because of lazy writing and idea that the movie-going public might not actually enjoy a film that is 'talky'. I don't necessarily consider BEFORE SUNRISE/SUNSET as arty, although the two characters talk about everything that pops into their heads and what I think really works is that they fully enjoy each other's company. I think that's important. Often in rom-coms, it starts with two people who can't stand to be around each other—You've Got Mail—eventually, though, the couple fall in love. Not in the case of these two films where two people from polar opposite worlds find that they really have a chemistry viable, can agree—and in some cases disagree—about issues and beliefs, yet accept their differences and talk intently about them, share and take in the luxurious environs around them while they do so. You know, if anything, I can simply sit and watch Delpy for the running time, her smile just overwhelms me to my very core and I can reason why Hawke has never forgotten her, moved on past their night together, and has a degree of difficulty leaving her now that he has found her once again. To me, there's nothing like that smile, the kind of smile that softens you, grabs your heart in a clinched fist and squeezes you into submission. God, I heart that woman.",10,2,3,4 February 2011
Non-Stop," Non-Stop
","An alcoholic, disgraced NYC cop divorcée, Bill Marks (Liam Neeson), who lost his daughter to cancer has been an US Marshall on board planes serving as a protector, but his job will get a bit complicated: a terrorist is on board and using text messages (there's this savvy use of on screen text, a visual that ably communicates to us what he reads on his phone and responds in kind) to indicate a death-every-twenty-minutes threat which further makes matters worse when he's implicated as the one responsible for holding a plane full of passengers hostage in the sky! He will need to find out who is sending him messages and poisoning people (the head pilot dies as does a passenger first believed to be the terrorist), as well as, find and dispose of a bomb found in his fellow Marshall's case (Anson Mount; trafficking cocaine, engaging Neeson in hand-to-hand combat within a restroom in a memorable sequence), with protecting everyone on board a top priority becoming increasingly difficult. With tensions among the passenger manifest growing, impatient with his efforts to search out a terrorist, using physical methods when necessary (his 'roughing around certain passengers' routine does not ingratiate himself to those on the plane at all), and his own law enforcement on the ground believing he has become a loose cannon needing money wired to a trust account (this whole elaborate set up thanks to quite a brilliant mastermind), with a media now condemning him as guilty, Marks has mounting obstacles uprising against him. Can he weed out the real culprit? Preposterous plot (really, the eventual unmasking of the ones responsible for this whole affair and the reasoning behind why is just a doozy) and implausible conclusion involving altitude, a bomb going off, and a heroic landing, ask a lot of us, that's for sure. If Neeson wasn't in charge of this, as if a sheriff in charge of Tombstone, then Non Stop would be a hard pill to swallow. But, dammit, if he doesn't hold this together through star power alone! Julianne Moore gets the equivalent of a paycheck part as a passenger sitting next to him, becoming one of a few that totally trusts him. She is just fine, given a bit of a back-story involving a heart condition and secretive about her past, because Moore's a pro, but this kind of film is really beneath her caliber of talent at this point in her career. Neeson, however, has become an amazing model for a geriatric hero, once occupied by the likes of John Wayne and Clint Eastwood, so good at this action hero gig he defies age and is believable in the parts assigned him. How Neeson is able to continue to do this and not become a joke is a testament to his charisma and on screen prowess. He is the whole show, here, doggedly in charge of rooting out the bad guy(s) and rescuing the innocent, doing whatever it takes to save the day. At the end of the day, no matter the plot developments and complexities that are simply too unbelievable to accept rationally, it comes down to the hero before you and whether or not he is compelling enough to dedicate your time to. Neeson is such an actor.Going back to Moore, I do think she has good chemistry with Neeson who starts to rely on her and a stewardess he has grown to trust during his time as a US Marshall while on the plane. The discovery of how the pilot died, as an example, due to a hole in a restroom he goes to smoke a cig on occasion shows you how the film goes through its grab bag to help the hero solve his case. The film's pace, busy plot, and active hero keeps things rolling, hoping we don't try and stop to think about it. Corey Stoll of Ant-Man is a NYC cop, Scoot McNairy a school teacher, and Michelle McDockery a trustworthy stewardess with important parts in the film among an extensive supporting cast.",7,1,2,26 November 2015
The Transporter," The Transporter
","Incredible fight choreography and Statham athleticism (along with his usual cool and charisma), along with cars and buildings that go Kaboom!, offer plenty for action fans to embrace in this custom made star vehicle that follows a highly paid ex-military mercenary who performs tasks for customers with particular 'packages' they want delivered to specific locations under certain conditions. He has rules to abide by so that the transport goes without a hitch. Well, he 'opens a package' and what stares from within his trunk is a very pretty Asian woman (Qui Shu). She tells him of slaves being transported by those who hired him to bring her to them. If he doesn't help her they will die or be sold. What ultimately triggers his war with these dirtbags who initially hired him to bring them Shu is their attempt to blow him up in his car, a bomb disguised as another package for him to deliver. When they fire missiles at his château, it is game-on! With Matt Schulz as a lead heavy in cahoots with Shu's rotten pops (Ric Young), making Statham's life most difficult. The use of oil and the shirt off his back and the ability to fight himself out of cramped confines against a litany of men (inside a greyhound or sandwiched between carrier crates in a transport yard are such examples) are just some of the amazing stunts and fight scenes that make up this hotly paced actioner. The finale has Statham trying to avoid gunfire and Schulz' interference as he attempts to commandeer a truck hauling the human slaves in an exhilarating chase sequence. The fighting in the cab of the truck gets intense. Statham's use of his quick legs and how he orchestrates speedy kicks and sharp reflexes produce breathtaking results. The film opens with a humdinger of a car chase highlighting Statham's talents also behind the wheel. The whole point is to signify that Statham has arrived and no matter the firepower or manpower, he seems more than capable to avoid harm while others aren't so lucky.",9,0,1,25 April 2016
Tucker and Dale vs Evil," Tucker and Dale vs. Evil
","Brilliant, wonderfully absurd, backwoods slasher black comedy (graphic violence included) defines quite significantly that 'looks can be deceiving'. Two lovable hillbillies, Tucker and Dale (Alan Tudyk and Tyler Labine), are misjudged by misguided college students, on a vacation in the woods, who consider them menacing creeps just because of their attire and not-so-clean-shaven appearance. Neither is violent at all, just up at Tucker's newly bought ramshackle cabin to start renovation repairs. Dale has eyes on blond honey, Allison (the yummy Katrina Bowden), but when she sees him and Tucker in their fishing boat while about to swim, the psychology major slips after freaking out and falls in the water, nearly drowning. Tucker and Dale load her in the boat, saving her because she had a concussion, but her friends believe they are kidnapping her! When they say, 'We got your friend!' they think Tucker and Dale are warning them! Early on, when Tucker and Dale first see them and vice versa, the latter approaches Allie in the hopes of talking to her (encouraged by Tucker when Dale thinks he's not good enough), but having a scythe in his hand and a nervous giggle scares them all! Chad (Jesse Moss; Ginger Snaps)--the ringleader of the gang--vows to rescue Allie from the 'murderous psycho hillbillies'. What instead happens is the feckless kids start trying to upend what they believe are threats to them and their friend's life but only walk right into their own deaths! Hilarity ensues like one of the kids believing Tucker, who cut into a log which had a hornet's nest, is running after him with a chainsaw (all he is actually doing is fleeing from the hornets!), which causes him to flee through the woods recklessly, impaling himself on a sharp tree sticking out! One of the kids charges towards Tucker, who is operating a woodchipper, falling headfirst into the machineÂ…the legs sticking out, with all the spewing blood, as Tucker tries to save him is another grisly highlight (the sheriff driving up on Tucker and Dale dragging the legs and waist of the dead victim has to be seen to be believed). There's a sequence of startling events where a weedeater blade carves a face, a fire starts (ignited further by moonshine!), and gas canisters (on the inside of the cabin!) send Tucker's 'dream home' to go up in flames! Perhaps one of the kids lighting up a cig didn't help matters. A loose plank in the cabin is leaned on by the sheriff who actually listens to Tucker and Dale when appearances seem to say they've just killed a few kids, receiving a wood block with nails right into his forehead! Retrieving the dead sheriff's gun, one of the kids points the weapon at his face while unlocking the safety, shooting himself! Another kid dives at Dale while he and Allie are digging a hole (the kids think he is forcing Allie to dig her own grave!) for an outhouse, causing the kid to impale himself on the handle of the shovel! Chad, who tells his posse about a campfire tale about a camping massacre on Memorial Day, actually admits (during a 'counseling session' where Allie wants him and Dale to talk things over peacefully) that his mom and dad were involved in that! A revelation involving Chad's history will only further send him off the deep end (the movie does well at recognizing that Chad is a bit too excited about engaging in violence with the hillbillies).The film opens with Tucker giving Chad what seemed like an ominous look (he was in the middle of a request for supplies), reading off a list of items which would ideally indicate him and Tucker are backwoods serial killers. Then you see them talk once their outside, harmless and affable; from their perspective, there would be no reason to fear them. But then the film looks at Tucker and Dale from the side of the college kids, presenting them as sinisterÂ…the direction is fantastic at these dueling perceptions. Allie realizing that Tucker is a sweetheart who wouldn't harm anybody, and Dale is oblivious to why her friends are running around hysterically (both Tucker and Dale question if they are 'off their meds'!) is a fun development, too. The kids just can't help but invite disaster upon themselves. A real gem. Sadly, despite being a festival circuit darling, the movie never got a deserved theatrical run. It is better than most wide releases these days.",10,0,0,31 August 2016
Insidious," Insidious
","A family's idyll is undermined by a perplexing incident involving child Dalton (Ty Simpkins) falls into what they perceive to be a coma, but father and mother, Josh and Renai Lambert (Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne), so realize that he has the uncanny ability to 'astral project' himself during sleep (the ability of his soul leaving his body). After leaving a house they moved into because of eerie noises, disturbing sights of disrupting apparitions, unsettling voices, and Dalton's condition doesn't improve their situation at allit only worsens as those from a limbo-type after-death known as 'the further' want to use Dalton's body to enter the world of the living. If they don't want to forever lose their son, the Lamberts will need to enlist the aid of psychic Elise (the great Lin Shaye, inheriting the best role of her career) and her two paranormal investigating cohorts, Specs (Leigh Whannell, writer of the film) and Tucker (Angus Sampson). Barbara Hershey also shows up as Wilson's mom, Lorraine.James Wan's ode to 'Poltergeist' and its ilk even offers a hideous red-faced, black bodied demon which kidnaps Dalton and awaits Josh. Josh, a school teacher growing weary as his wife is in regards to the condition of a dormant Dalton, will need to head into the further to find his son, much in the same way Carol Anne will need her mom to do the same in Poltergeist. You have pale-skinned ghouls seemingly frozen in non-motion, only to creep up on Josh when he turns around while journeying into the further might remind you of the 'look out behind you' Weeping Angel Stone Figures on Doctor Who. The home-made gadgets Specs and Tucker pull out to investigate are a real side-splitter (they are fashioned by toys, household items, and everyday devices), particularly the gas-mask head piece Elise wears while communicating to Specs what Dalton says inside the further. The bickering and attempted one-upmanship between Specs and Tucker is part of their Abbot and Costello shtick and charm. Their partnership with Elise itself is rather amusinghow they seem like such an unlikely trio out to help others stuck in a situation few would accept as factual.Wan followed his 'Saw' formula in the bleak ending (you also see this in 'Dead Silence') as perhaps someone who came back from the further might not be who they appear. The sound effects and music cues are a Wan necessity it seems. The 'Insidious' titles in big red letters and the violins striking up aloud are a trademark of the franchisequite a recognizable aesthetic. The lantern light Josh uses as he moves through the further really is a nice touch, such as when he encounters those in this after-death but there is a lot of darkness, and the decision to show as little of the demon as possible gets a bit disappointing. It is shown just enough to prove how unpleasant it looksSpecs drawing of it based on Elise's description is a good little scene, though. The pictures by Dalton also offer an affective visual evidence Josh needs to motivate him to disavow his skepticism. Elise's fate is horrifying and somewhat unexpected. The further offered Wan and Whannell plenty of room to create this completely unique worldfor the most part it can be quite equal parts spooky and frustrating considering the darkness. The ghost photography is an obvious homage to the Japanese horror boon of the late 90s/early 2000s as Josh is linked to Dalton in regards to his own ability to astral project. The way the ghouls emerge and pop up at unanticipated times are essential tricks Wan relies on throughout. This film seems to be a like it or disapprove of it affair. I guess I'm somewhere in the middle.6.5/10",6,0,0,13 January 2016
The Theory of Everything," The Theory of Everything
","Basic biopic in storytelling, about physicist and professor Stephen Hawking (Eddie Redmayne) not so much focusing extensively on the science which defines the man as much as his travails with motor neurone disease and his relationship with wife, Jane (Felicity Jones), a young woman he met at Cambridge U. At once walking and talking like any other student, he is gradually struck with a disease that debilitates him. Confined to a wheelchair, a bout of near-fatal pneumonia requiring a tracheotomy, unable to speak, and needing a computer system to voice the words in his brilliant mind, Stephen Hawking would be a great influence on the scientific community, particularly in his work on the black hole and the vast boundaries of the universe. The film occasionally touches on his dealings with religion and God due to his wife and helpful assistant (a choir director Jane eventually falls in love with) being of the Christian faith. And while also occasionally highlighted considering the focal character's profession and genius so intertwined with science, the struggles with disease and how Stephen overcomes what limits him is the most important aspect of the biopic. Stephen and Jane are equally important to those behind this biopic. Stephen is so well thought of in this film, he's basically a patron saintthe film seems to go out of its way to make him as endearing and worthy of affection as possible. Jane is shown primarily as a wife and mother in constant struggle to help him, but her efforts eventually demand someone more inclined to patiently offer devotion to him, which a hired nurse is able to (which Stephen eventually falls in love with). The ending reflects a reunion between former married partners when the queen offers a special accommodation, and Stephen has Jane look at their children, realizing what they have accomplished. Sugary and sweet when it needs to be, rarely showing any strife despite a disease that one would think might exist, the film just doesn't want to look at Stephen as anything but commendable. The score is fitting for the kind of biopic being presented: it is effectively sentimental, elegant, tragic, and encouraging. The score, like the dreamy photographic look, aims to manipulate our emotions and take us on a journey that allows us to embrace this man wholeheartedly. As far as depicting the complications of a horrible disease, this film knocks it out of the ballpark. But I think what is ultimately fascinating about the man—the genius and the science that came from it--is less important to those that made this film. This film cares deeply about Stephen, but it glosses over a great deal of what people in his field consider important.Redmayne offers a painstakingly detailed physical performance mimicking Stephen's plight; it screams Oscar bait, but he's damned impressive just the same. Felicity Jones is equally good as the burdened but mostly loyal wife. Their chemistry is first rate. I do think the film takes creative license and paints in strokes that allows us to come away with a great deal of respect and admiration for Stephen, without seeing him *warts and all*.",6,3,4,26 November 2015
I Am Legend," I Am Legend
","A plague sweeps across the world and renders civilization a mass of dead and infected savages(..named Darkseekers who only hunt at night with an inability to withstand sunlight it seems), a survivor, Doctor Robert Neville(Will Smith)seeks a cure, working effortlessly in his lab, slowly losing hope of ever achieving such a feat. He also often hunts the Darkseekers at night, setting traps to capture live specimens so that he can attempt to cure them. During the struggle to find a cure, Neville's resolve and courage begin to dwindle, and his need for human interaction are proving to become his undoing.Rather simply and predictably told, with CGI creatures which look like characters from a video game, it's Smith's riveting performance that keeps this rather weak interpretation afloat. Some action/thriller elements are delivered somewhat well as Neville finds himself in life-threatening situations with the Darkseekers. Alice Braga and Charlie Tahan are Anna and Ethan, mother and son survivors who enter Neville's life towards the middle of the film as he, in desperation and despair, almost kills himself by driving straight into an army of Darkseekers. Smith is able to convey a sense of loss and a desperate need for companionship with the film expressing a quiet, devastated New York City. Smith's work opposite his pet companion, Samantha, are really effective and his scene with a department store mannequin echo The Twilight Zone episode, Is There Anybody Out There? But, you've seen this all before and the film really doesn't set itself apart from other films which focused on the same type of Matheson story. Still Smith does what is required of him and the film benefits from such a performance even if the special effects are not up to par.",5,1,1,17 January 2009
The Bourne Legacy," The Bourne Legacy
","I'm not sure what it was but this newest Bourne film felt a bit incomplete as the credits rolled. It felt every bit 'tune in next movie for the further adventures of' instead of a Bourne film that might stand on its own without the necessity of seeing the next one coming down the pike in the future. I guess that was the whole point, but I wasn't satisfied with the whole although the visit to and action in Manila delivered plenty of suspense and roller coaster action. While Treadstone is trying to find and eliminate Jason Bourne, Eric Byer (Ed Norton) is commissioned by Mark Turso (Stacy Keach) to 'clean up' anything dealing with super soldiers (humans genetically engineered with superior mental and physical abilities), including scientists and those men 'bio-engineered'. One such soldier is Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner), nearly blown to bits by a drone plane's missiles while 'training' in the mountains of Canada (?). He discovers a beacon inserted in his leg, removes it, places it in the mouth of a bloodthirsty wolf, and watches as the next missile temporarily allows him to go undetected (Byer and the military personnel behind the drone plane attack believe the wolf was Cross). A scientist (Zeljko Ivanek), important in the genetic breakthrough that made Treadstone and Outcome such successes in the formation of human killing machines of amazing skills and strength, speed and agility, goes on a killing spree, mass shooting every scientist in the laboratory, almost succeeding except for Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz) who is saved by the security finally rescuing her in the nick of time. Byer will send agents in to execute Marta, but this time Cross comes to her aid, helping to remove the threat to her life. On the lam, Cross needs 'blues' due to the worsening effects that happen to those like him experimented on; these pills help to retain the mental strength and hold off the psychotic effects that might come if left unabated. Marta believes she can help Cross 'viral out' and maintain his mental prowess if she can get access to materials found in a lab in Manila. So Cross will try to help her do just that; all of this while Byer and all the tools and manpower available to him through Turso try to find him and Marta. There's an intense chase scene at the end where Cross and Marta attempt to circumvent Byer's plans to put them down one way or another. There's even a Manila 'soldier' after them, with quite a race within the busy streets and highways of the Philippines as Cross and Marta, on motorcycle, try to evade their pursuers (the police and super soldier). Lots of close calls in tight spaces between vehicles and avoiding traffic all around them. Really cool 'climb' scenes where Cross scales buildings and walks across rooftops with relative ease as if simian. I thought Weisz was very good (no surprise), put through the ringer, and Renner has a kind face that is unable to contain emotion unlike Damon's Bourne who could often mask the inner emotional struggles within his psyche and keep in check the baggage that existed and haunted him. Still, saying that, this film never quite hit that sweet spot so typical of all three of the previous Bourne films. Cross' back story is hinted at in bits and pieces; we know that Byer was once in charge of him in the Middle East, and that through great agonies suffered, Cross wanted to be part of the super soldier program. But Cross' moral rationale of what his superiors stand and are responsible for is ultimately what pushes him to question even early on Treadstone and Outcome's ultimately agenda and endgame. While there was a strong sense of realism even though Bourne's fighting skills and superb intellect and ability to adjust to any situation quickly were superior, The Bourne Legacy is even more outlandish and far-fetched, using science as the means to create a superhero. This feels the most like a comic book character created in a lab; Aaron Cross might as well have been bitten by a spider or doused with peculiar radiation. This stretches credibility to the max. Like when, all of a sudden, Cross can take out men in a matter of seconds after Marta injects him with a viral cocktail that seems to immediately turn him into a fighting machine. It's awesome to watch, but this bit of sudden violence asks us to accept that science can provide much in quick order. I guess we need to look at this film as a beginning of something 'better' later, because I never felt The Bourne Legacy quite reached its full potential. This does leave open a Matt Damon return if he felt so inclined.",6,0,3,17 May 2013
Ghostbusters," Ghostbusters
","There are plenty great comedies of the 80s but within the Mount Rushmore, 'Ghostbusters' is perhaps George Washington or Lincoln. Well at least to this 80s kid who remembers the film (and, yes, its cartoon), it is one of the greats. The song is iconic, ghosts turned loose on NYC when damned Atherton and that punchable face insist the Ghostbuster team shut off their 'ghost concealment machine' at their headquarters (refurbished firestation that perhaps, as Egon says, should have been condemned) because he considered their whole operation a farce (despite evidence that proves otherwise), the entire classic pursuit of Slimer in the fancy hotel which leaves the building a mess due to their protopacks missing the green, floating ugly with mouth and teeth gobbling food from trays inside the building's floors), the library ghoul that sends Egon, Venkman, and Ray running for their lives, poor Alice Drummond in the library scared half to death, Moranis who steals every scene he's in as the well-meaning but feckless neighbor in Weaver's apartment complex pursued by one of the demon hounds (The KeyMaster) who can't get any help from a restaurant full of uninterested patrons, Weaver possessed by another of the demon hounds (The Gatekeeper) who becomes a client of the Ghostbusters when her eggs crack and cook on her counter and pursued romantically by Murray, Hudson's Winston telling Ray that when a Sumerian demon asks if he is a god he says YES (seriously, Hudson never gets his due but he's so funny as the straight man to his goofy scientists, reacting as we might to their pseudo-paranormal babble), Murray's Venkman 'testing' Steven Tash and the lovely Jennifer Runyon for 'psychic abilities' (using his 'jolt device' for kicks on Tash, while also looking to date Runyon), Aykroyd and Ramis' straight-faced 'paranormal speak' often poked fun at by Murray with Hudson humoring them even as he clearly wonders what the hell they are talking about, Murray's dedicated quest to woo Weaver and her clear inability to totally avoid his charms, Moranis constantly locked out of his apartment, the Mayor (David Margulies; I just love this guy) having to respond to the inexplicable ramifications of Atherton's ordered release of all the paranormal activity trapped by the Ghostbuster team on his city, Annie Potts (another perfect casting choice) as the nasally, quirky secretary at the GB headquarters who proclaims the immortal line, 'We got one!!!' while flirting with Egon ('I collect spores, molds, and fungus'), and all the neat special effects (one of my favorites is the rotted cabbie!) make up just some of the highlights. This cast is such an epic ensemble. 'Back off, man. I'm a scientist'.",10,3,3,10 August 2019
The Illusionist," The Illusionist
","I'm not sure I buy the end result(an illusionary twist which depends on an awful lot of coincidence), but it's a lot of fun getting there. Visually dazzling and well executed drama about an illusionist named Eisenheim(Edward Norton who is quite spellbinding in a very mysterious role)who ruffles the feathers of Crown Prince Leopold(Rufus Sewell at his nasty, slimy best;he's just so menacing in these juicy roles as hot-tempered aristocrats who will not be made fool of in crowds as long as he has power)with a trick(a humdinger of irony;it's an Excaliber trick which really pokes fun at Leopold). Torn away from his beloved Sophie(he a son of a peasant cabinet-maker, she a duchess), Eisenheim once again meets her on stage only to find out she's possibly to marry Leopold. But, that flame burns as bright as ever, and Leopold uses his patsy of a police inspector, Uhl(Paul Giamatti, who is very, very good)to find dirt on Eisenheim to shut his illusion act down. Imagine the fury inside Leopold when he finds out from Uhl that Sophie and Eisenheim may be plotting a getaway. Leopold is not a man to be trifled with, and Sophie is a major factor for him to gain favor with the Hungarians. When Sophie informs Leopold that it is Eisenheim she wants, it appears that he may've stabbed her with his withdrawn sword. Her body is found with a gaping wound which seems to show signs of being stabbed through the neck..gems from a certain sword may prove Leopold's guilt.This throws Eisenheim's life in a whole new direction as he finds an old theater and begins performing what appear to be resurrections of ghosts which shock and awe audience-goers. Uhl begins to notice a following and Leopold himself even attends a show under guise when Eisenheim shocks everyone in attendance by 'resurrecting Sophie's ghost'! Leopold is certainly enraged now and wants Eisenheim stopped at all costs because there are now vocal Vienna folk claiming the Prince as being a murderer(his past murder of another girl he pushed off a balcony doesn't help his case any).The ending is a doozy(the final illusion on stage and a little twist that occurs once we see Leopold's fate)and really had my jaw dropped to the floor in amazement. The film offers many cool illusions performed on stage by Eisenheim, but it's also Norton's mysterious performer who holds you at a distance wondering just how truly gifted he really is. That mystery he has is vital to the strength of the film I believe. We don't need to see how he does the tricks he accomplishes because just wondering what kind of powers he really has a hold on not just the audience watching him perform..but us as well.",8,0,1,15 January 2007
Event Horizon," Event Horizon
","The crew of the Lewis and Clark, a search and rescue vessel, are told to seek out the science space ship, Event Horizon, which has been missing for seven years. Event Horizon was spotted near Neptune and this is where they find the ship. Led by Captain Miller(Laurence Fishburne)the crew are to find out what happened to the crew on board and bring any information which might explain why such a ship could remain missing for so long. Once on board, however, the crew realizes that this ship has been to an uncharted dimension..a kind of evil that has taken over the ship and, in time, the crew. The former scientists on the previous mission, thanks to the creative genius of Dr. William Weir(Sam Neill), were on a mission to guide the Event Horizon on a special experiment in the 'folding of space'..in other words, the ship would travel from one destination to another through a created black hole/gateway. What the crew did travel to, and died from, is for the Lewis and Clark to find out. But, what occurred to that crew(a horror that is recorded on a disc)seven years ago is starting to effect the crew of Lois and Clark. It seems that the heart of Event Horizon, the core that operates the ship, opens on it's own releasing 'the dark' some evil force that opens up the inner iniquity of those on board who harbor guilt regarding past mistakes. The evil attacks it's prey by tapping into their fear and exposing it through manipulation. Med Tech, Peters(Kathleen Quinlan)sees the diseased son for whom the job keeps her away from. Miller is plagued by the burning victim he had to leave behind on a mission to save his crew. Weir sees the wife who committed suicide. The ship seems to want Weir as it's tool for disrupting the crew's escape. The Lewis and Clark was badly damaged when the core opens pulling crewman Justin(Jack Noseworthy)inside and then spitting him out. A ripple effect/surge from within the core causes major damage. With limited air supply on the Event Horizon, they must repair hull damage or die. But, the evil on board Event Horizon doesn't want them to leave anyway.In theory, most believe the Event Horizon 'visited' Hell during the folding of space. Fooling with such things as creating a black hole is risky even if you wish to travel faster from destination to another. We do know that Justin mentions after being thrown out of where ever it was he was taken, that 'the dark' is coming. The dark could mean anything. What appears on the disc shows the former crew having a violent sex orgy, killing each other. You know from this that the evil that permeates on Event Horizon can change individuals into something quite deviant. The film can be really scary and graphic which is right up my alley. One of the great examples of what you can do with the blending of science fiction and horror. This film has incredible set-design and visual effects..the best money can buy. But, without that fascinating and disturbing plot, this would be just another rehash. The cast is fun to watch and the terror is genuine. A winner for Paul WS Anderson, if you ask me.",8,0,3,11 March 2007
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo
","Swedish puzzler/thriller about a damaged young women, Lisbeth Salander(Noomi Rapace), whose skills as a hacker(including her technical know-how in regards to surveillance)are well utilized by a specific corporation, helps a soon-to-be-imprisoned news reporter, Mikael Biomkvist(Michael Nyqvist, in an excellent, understated performance)as they attempt to find out what happened to a wealthy man's niece, Harriet. Henrik Vanger(Sven-Bertil Taube)is a very old man who yearns to discover what happened to his beloved Harriet, who vanished some 40 years ago, still receiving pictures of flowers from who he believes to be her killer. As the two join forces after a unique set of circumstances unifies them(paid by a Vanger personally to dig up any information pertaining to Blmkvist, she finds nothing criminal, which motivates Henrik to hire him; her continual hacking into Mikael's hard drive, she provides info which assists in moving the case forward), the search for Harriet may actually uncover a serial killer who was using bible verses as a means to symbolize the horrific crimes. Could Harriet have been a victim of this killer as well? Also, Blomkvist finds that several of the Vangers were Nazi loyalists. This is one of those thrillers which carries two down a dark road which yields unpleasant truths about a powerful family, the ole 'skeletons in the closet' are revealed. The scene where Blomkvist is bound and seemingly at the mercy of the remorseless psychopath is chilling to the bones.A word of warning: there's a guardian assigned to Lisbeth who is a perverse deviant who wants sexual favors(which soon includes rough sex and anal abuse)in return for granting her money that she normally handled herself. He blackmails her by threatening to send her back to a psychological ward if she doesn't 'behave' and adhere to his desires. This includes a terrible rape which may be hard to watch, but there's payback for this sumbitch's evil deeds..Lisbeth gets his ass big time(emphasis on ass). Interesting development, the much older Blomkvist is startled when Lisbeth wakes him up in the middle of the night to have sex with him(could be a little creepy for some folks, but I found it rather surprisingly erotic). Important storyline involving a flashback to Lisbeth's past could explain part of why she's so distant, such a loner who has a hard time attaining emotional bonds..it also deals with why Lisbeth needs a guardian in the first place.What I found absorbing was the use of photographs as a way to unlock the great mystery, and I think the investigative side of the movie(following the leads one step at a time, dead ends are removed, Lisbeth a major contributor to the answers which come to fruition)can be gripping if you let yourself be taken in.A story thread that is almost forgotten once the central plot takes over involves Mikel's future prison time due to his being set up by faulty sources in regards to a corrupt businessman he was trying to expose(this businessman's fate is a humdinger).",8,3,6,12 August 2010
From Dusk Till Dawn," From Dusk Till Dawn
","I realize that Quentin Tarantino is a polarizing figure who has both admirers and critics because his films usually feature extreme acts of behavior that test a viewer's threshold and tolerance for cinematic violence and excess. His characters have dialogue that is often outrageous, explicitly vulgar, and even cartoonish. There's a quality in FROM DUSK TILL DAWN where it feels less like a naturalistic landscape and more of a trip into some ultra-violent, profane, frighteningly subversive place, directed with style and lack of restraint where QT and director Robert Rodriguez(..whose previous films, particularly DESPERADO, show just why he was born to form a partnership with Tarantino), throw caution to the wind, whipping up a gratuitous brew of machismo, visceral shocks, and over-the-top dialogue clashes. There's plenty of wicked, audacious humor, and you can just sense the perverted joy and child-like enthusiasm as you watch the film..this was definitely a labour of love for Rodriguez and QT.The cast is a phenomenon for a buff like me, particularly seeing Tom Savini battling it out with vampire Danny Trejo, Fred Williamson pulling a heart from the chest of a massive bloodsucker, and Harvey Kietel standing off a drove of ugly fiends using a baseball bat and shotgun in the image of crucifix. A deliriously nifty gag shows how 'equipped' Savini really is where it counts! Also, seeing The Hammer get his cigar lit by a table dancing mamacita is also quite a highlight. Tarantino's homicidal Richard Gecko is a truly repellent character(..he's a seriously warped sex offender whose 'deficiencies' drive him to kill those women he's drawn to)with a fixation for feet. The ultimate showstopper has the jaw-droppingly sexy Salma Hayek, as dancer Santanico Pandemonium, moving her audience into silence with quite a smoldering number. Clooney gets many chances to round off QT's constant supply of attitude-laden, very aggressive dialogue, his forceful presence ably fulfilling the role of an antagonistic criminal, who isn't afraid to use his gun, but would rather just succeed in his goal to reach a safe haven.The movie's a tale of two halves..before and after our cast of characters drive into the Mexican Titty Twister bar. Fugitive brothers, Seth and Richard Gecko(George Clooney and QT)are on the lam, heading for Mexico, blazing a violent trail through Texas, where their ticket to safety, as law enforcement and FBI are out to get them, lie in the RV of a former minister, Jacob(Keitel)and his children, Kate and Scott(Juliette Lewis and Ernest Liu). Getting across the border, preparing for a rendezvous with an associate, The Bros Gecko think their troubles are over. The meeting location is the Mexican strip club, for truck drivers and bikers, the Titty Twister. What they don't expect is that the club is actually a front for a coven of vampires who use the place as a method of luring their meals! So Seth, once his bro becomes a neck feast for a bloodsucker, must forge an alliance with Jacob and his kids in order to somehow survive their dead-serious crisis...getting some assistance from others, such as 'Sex Machine'(Savini)and Frost(Williamson)who are able to outlast the first assault against the vampires. The opening half displays Seth's difficult trials with his unpredictable brother who seems unable to control himself. The vampire battles are heaven for gore aficionados, as bodies are ripped limb-from-limb along with plenty of effective uses of stakes driven through vampires in gruesome, unusual ways. KNB supplies the magnificent make-up effects. Some of the computer generated work is a bit noticeable, but I was satisfied with their work. Cheech Marin is a hoot in three roles, Kelly Preston has a cameo as a reporter, and the great John Saxon gets to stop by as a cop threatening to catch the Geckos.",8,0,1,1 August 2009
Paranormal Activity," Paranormal Activity
","Paranormal Activity concerns a supernatural presence, perhaps demonic, terrorizing a couple, not married, with them recording the events on camera. We are privy to the footage and see how the presence consumes their life until it has what it so desires.While I do agree that Paranormal Activity is little more than a glorified you-tube video, I can't completely dismiss it because it has some genuine spooks here and there. I do admit to finding it a bit tiresome after a while, there were others in the theater where I went to see it who were quite gripped and frightened out of their wits as the 'ooga booga' moments transpire, pretty much late at night and early in the morning as the camera allows us to see the evil with effects like thuds, loud noises, shadows, wind brushing hair, sheets moving, lights going on and off, with other supernatural hi-jinx plaguing the couple, Michah(a day trader)and college student girlfriend Katie(Katie Featherston). Katie foretells how she has always been afflicted by this mysterious presence, no matter where she moves to, it follows. A psychic(Mark Fredrichs)attempts to provide advice, but it's his opinion that the thing living among them is demonic, and his expertise are more towards haunting. He provides them with the phone number of a demonologist, but Micah pooh-poohs such an idea as calling such a person. In not doing so, as we see what kind of influence Micah has over her, Katie may've put herself at greater risk regarding not seeking the assistance of the demonologist. Micah is sure he can keep Katie safe, not knowing truly what they're up against.While the predator is indeed the supernatural presence, Katie it's prey, Micah is surely the antagonist. Micah seems excited about the idea of recording such a fiend on tape, not knowing that the camcorder is assisting in motivating the evil presence to continue, and it does grow more and more confident and powerful. We start to see Katie changing, behavioral shifts, and strange instances where she moves from the bed, as if controlled by something else, just standing, looking down at Micah, even leaving the house not under her own accord, remembering nothing. Perhaps if they had contacted the demonologist sooner(..a later call is in vain for he had left the country and the psychic would not remain in their home due to it's strength in power for which he felt immediately), help could've been provided to Katie.The fact is, Micah is a prick. The camcorder is always on even when Katie's in a devastated condition, her emotional state in turmoil. He wants everything on tape and will go to extreme lengths in order to do so. Late into Paranormal Activity, Katie's visibly shaken and deeply traumatized, and it's only when the presence may've taken control of her that Micah opts to leave. Riding the coattails of The Blair Witch Project(..they resemble in fascinating ways), PA takes the 'shot on tape' approach, capturing strange goings-on, as those affected by the evil, psychologically and otherwise, lose control, after what seems like an amusing joke where the 'participants' aren't very serious about what they're up against. Katie, to her credit, does take the evil seriously, and she's the one who falls victim, thanks to the man she loves. Micah treats it as an amusement park ride, toying with an evil which will upend him in the end for his handling of this entire situation costs them dearly.",6,2,3,28 November 2009
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix
","Harry Potter's internal struggle with the evil Lord Voldemort is at the heart of this cerebral installment, taking a break from the overpowering action we are used to seeing(..tournament wizard contests and such)instead focusing on a potential threat towards Hogwarts school in the chuckling new professor, Dolores Umbridge(Imelda Staunton)with her wide-eyes and seemingly modest exterior harbours an aggressive desire to have full control of the school, operating by her strict standards, attempting to remove wizardry, enabling the students to practice their craft. Secretly a war is brewing between Dumbledore(Michael Gambon)and Voldemort with Harry playing a vital chess piece. It will be revealed that either Harry or Voldemort will live but both can not co-exist, a prophesy most certain to propel the next film. But, this film does follow Harry' further growth as a powerful wizard, and his nemesis particularly in this movie is Umbridge who wishes to silence the young man from even mentioning Voldemort's name. Pursuing the knowledge of casting spells which can protect them from harm, and thus enabling them to join Dumbledore's army, Hermoine(Emma Watson)and Ron(Rupert Grint)will convince Harry to train volunteers secretly behind Umbridge's back. Harry also converses with his godfather, wrongfully accused serial killer Sirius Black(Gary Oldman)who keeps him informed of the latest news regarding what Dumbledore wishes to remain hidden for his safety. We witness a very paranoid Minster of the Ministry of Magic believing that Dumbledore may be enlisting a force against him(..perhaps in part to whispers from those who might wish to see Dumbledore out as headmaster of Hogwarts)and it's visible as the newspapers increase the unease as Potter's claim of Voldemort's return has many split, some considering it bogus, others worried that he's correct.Film still features state-of-the-art special effects(..such as our introduction to Hagrid's giant half-brother and the frightening dementors working for Voldemort), but the emphasis is more towards Potter as a central figure as turmoil rages within the world of magic and wizardry. While growing into adulthood, the teenage students are forced into adult decisions as secret evils await them and the political order of things is a boiling pot where Voldemort is on the thoughts of everyone even if many would rather remain blinded/oblivious to such a horrifying truth. You get a nifty showdown between Dumbledore and Voldemort and the teen wizards even face off with Voldemort's brood who escape Azkaban. Potter's emergence as a powerful wizard whose humanity is his strength(..Voldemort considers him weak because of his emotions for those he loves)an unfolding character arc because he will be tested against the dark powers with Voldemort desiring to take control of his body. And, a very important plot-point emerges regarding Severus Snape(Alan Rickman)and why he holds such a grudge against Harry, concerning Potter's father. Once again we realize that Lucius Malfoy(Jason Isaacs)is a dangerous presence in that he's an agent for Voldemort working on the inside, an intruder who can disrupt things within the Ministry of Magic. Helena Bonham Carter returns in a small role as sorceress Bellatrix Lestrange, murdering a major supporting character who was such a guiding force in Harry's life. Above all, the importance of friendship is at the very core of this installment..Harry needs the support of his friends and allies more than ever before. There's a lot going on and it's clear that the screenplay tries to fit as much as possible from the source novel.",7,0,2,18 January 2009
Into the Wild," Into the Wild
","Haunting portrait of a young man trying to find peace and solace after leaving a home that had anything but it. Alaska, its wild frontier, is what Chris McCandless (Emile Hirsch) believes is the answer to his emptiness and desire for a life that has adventure for him. Sean Penn, as director, opts to go back and forth, showing us parts of the man's life prior to his death, at too young an age, due to a poisoned plant life plucked from the very nature he thought would be his salvation, while holing up in an abandoned bus (or the skeleton of what was once a bus; now just a shell that allows him to have a refuge of some sort).We see his parents argue volatilely (William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden), while he tries to shield his sister (Jena Malone) from its effects. Once he graduates college and his first real job goes bust, Chris decides to take to the open road, meeting the likes of hippies (Catherine Keener and Brian H Dieker) living within a commune, a teenage girl (a malnourished- looking Kristen Stewart), a company owner (Vince Vaughn) who gets in trouble with the law, and an elderly, genteel, Army veteran widower (who lost his wife and child to a traffic accident caused by a drunk driver) who works in leather as a trade for extra money (living off a decent pension). The lives of those he encounters are touched by his warm spirit and good heart, and the true tragedy of the film is the realization that he could have built a good life with strong relationships had he chosen to. Instead, he'll die alone, sickly, starving, and without a chance to say goodbye to the family that didn't know his whereabouts or plans. Malone gets some narration to dictate to the viewer the disappointment in not getting to communicate more with her brother when he was gone from home, pondering about what might have been. The storytelling structure Penn applies takes us to different points of McCandless alone and with people, as we see the mistake of not accepting what was right in front of him: a chance for a real family. Hal Holbrook got a much deserved Oscar nomination for his performance as a lonely old man awaken from his isolated life by this spirited young man who had a date with destiny. The expansive travelogue of the character gives Penn a chance to use locations across the map visually and aesthetically. Like any good road movie, the country of the United States offers much in the way of storytelling. Hirsch is a revelation in the lead; all that vulnerability and yearning for something of substance and sustenance in life drives him away from the potential of true happiness into a dying despair he cannot correct. Truly a poignant and depressing conclusion but what a story Penn has to tell. Good use of music by Vedder and company to factor into the various dramatic highs and lows of McCandless' life before his death.",8,0,2,21 August 2015
Taken," Taken
","When Albanians kidnap his daughter while she is with her friend in Paris, former agent, Bryan Mills(Liam Neeson) will hunt for them, find them, and kill them. Simple as that. The film follows his pursuit of every last scumbag involved with doping up his teenage daughter, preparing her for prostitution, even discovering that members of French police are involved(..including an agent he knew while in the field). Almost everyone involved in this network of trafficking female tourists, the Albanian lowlifes who kidnap and pimp the girls(..including those responsible for selling virgins, including Kim, to a wealthier clientèle), and anyone else connected with this despicable business, Bryan eliminates. He warned them and they wouldn't listen.For a PG-13 film, this is very violent, with Neeson in incredible form, and absolutely convincing, as a specialist in combative techniques, trained to quickly upend the enemy. He mentions to his daughter when she asks of his profession, and Bryan says that the title was a 'preventer', and his mission is to secure the package which is her. He doesn't prevent the carnage that is inflicted on those who made the unfortunate mistake of taking his daughter. TAKEN is a film obviously influenced, in regards to the cold-blooded and swift actions of the hero, as many films have been as of late, by the BOURNE series because director Pierre Morel shoots the fight scenes with quick cuts and the camera often moves at a frenzied pace..Bryan's moves are so fast, it almost takes your breath away because before his adversaries can engage in combat, their bodies are dropped to the floor, a sharp thrust to the throat or abdomen knocking them for a loop. The 'race against time' aspect reminded me of William Friedkin's THE HUNTED because Bryan is always on the move, every action devoted to rescuing his daughter(..like Tommy Lee Jones seeking after killer Benicio Del Toro hardly stopping to relax as time was of the utmost importance), no dawdling is allowed. While Morel makes an effort to show little actual flesh damage from weapons fired(..more blood spray on walls), most of the violence is of a physical nature, Bryan pulvarising foes at an alarming speed. The plot set-up might burden the more action-hungry fans, but I appreciated the decision to develop the dynamics of the father-daughter relationship and how his strained feelings with ex-wife Lenore(Famke Janssen)have undermined Bryan's intentions to make up for lost time thanks to his overwhelming job in the field protecting the country. How Bryan succeeds in his mission is really a pleasure to behold, and Neeson's effective performance really adds a great deal to TAKEN. Discovering what happens to kidnapped girls, drugged for prostitution is horrifying, and you can sympathize with why Bryan is so dedicated to wiping out this whole disgusting operation. A certified crowd-pleaser, critics re-evaluated this action thriller after it become a big hit.",9,1,4,30 May 2009
Drag Me to Hell," Drag Me To Hell
","Sam, you are so mean. Poor Christine(Alison Lohman, who is such a sweetheart, a poor girl with a run of bad luck) is run through the spiritual ringer for about 100 minutes attempting to fight off the gypsy curse summoning a goat demon, Lamia, to take her to hell. Lorna Raver is certain to be remembered by horror fans for many years to come for her creepy gypsy, Mrs. Ganush, sure is made up as ghoulish and ugly as possible, the perfect kind of grotesque creation only to be found in a Sam Raimi horror outing. Christine decides that if she is to get a vacant assistant manager position in her bank, she'll need to be tougher, and Ganush, of all people, is the one that turns up at her desk, pleading for a third extension, and to deny her could be the break she needs. It's unfortunate that the example to be made of would be a powerful gypsy with the ability to unleash an evil curse on you, but that is the kind of Sam Raimi foil Christine is. An accursed object, a button removed from Christine's coat, must be passed to another as a gift in order to relinquish the goat demon spell. She attempts, through help of a 'seer', Rham Jas(Dileep Rao), to get rid of the demon through a sacrifice(..her cat!)and séance with Shaun San Dena(Adriana Barraza), a reputed spiritualist who once faced the demon, as it possessed a boy who stole from a gypsy, and lost. The circumstances continue to pile up. Christine attempts to broker a deal with Ganush, but discovers she's dead. The coveted position she so desired is potentially going to her rival, Stu(Reggie Lee), who stole her account attempting to sell it to another bank. And, her first meeting with the wealthy parents of psych professor boyfriend Clay(Justin Long)doesn't go well thanks to the bothersome antics of the curse. A pesky fly, blood gushing from her nose and mouth, a powerful wind that continues to dishevel rooms in her house, and the goat demon smacking her across the chops and lifting her off the floor hurling her in the air like a rag doll, not to mention high frequency noise that pierces her ears(..and the constant presence of shadowy spooks which show up to wreak havoc), poor Christine is having quite a rough three days. And, the horrifying knowledge that the Lamia will come to take her to hell to spend eternity in torment isn't exactly a comforting thought either.Boy, does Sam Raimi make a vocal return to the genre that made him a star. Using CGI and some ghastly make-up effects, Raimi pulls out all the stops and puts his heroine through one nightmarish scenario after another. And, even when you believe the poor girl might finally be rid of the terrors that plague her, he gets all mean-spirited again, unleashing more on her. Plenty of gross-out gags, including the scene where Christine bleeds all over her boss, a fly goes up her nose, and the corpse of Ganush falls on top of her, spilling embalming fluid all over her! Lohman is very much the female equivalent of Bruce Campbell, except the evil isn't confined to one general area, like the cabin and it's surrounding wilderness, but instead follows the girl wherever she goes. Welcome back, Sam, we missed you..and don't stay gone for 16 years next time! The ending, I must admit, left me quite disturbed. PG-13 rating is pushed to the brink, that's for sure.",8,0,2,17 October 2009
The Descent," The Dark
","I got existential with this film. It reminded me greatly of 'The Blair Witch Project' where we see these characters unknowingly entering certain horror..we know what will happen, but they have no idea what certain doom they willingly will be entering. You can not fault anyone but one and that is the guide who takes them into an 'undiscovered' tavern; that would be Juno(Natalie Jackson Mendoza). The others believe they are taking a trip into a known cavern, and the fun of entering is very lively on their faces. These thrill-seekers have did all sorts of wild things such as rafting down rough currents over dangerous rocks..but those experiences won't even compare to what waits for them in the dark. We see these young women leaving their off-road vehicles just like those three documentarians about to enter in the woods of Burkettsville, but they will enter a whole other territory where you can not see the sky above.Sarah(Shauna Macdonald)is the main character of the film for we see what has occurred to her already. Sarah is indeed a tragic character we can latch onto for her husband and daughter were taken from her in an awful car crash. We see the dreams of watching Sarah's daughter blowing out the candles of a birthday cake..this would never happen, but it provides peace when there isn't much in reality. One might ask what the point of this is, but it matters more when one views director Marshall's bleak ending to this film. Sarah follows her supposed guide into what she believes to be a friendly cavern, but never realizes what she will become during that very trip inside a completely different cavern than she was led to believe.This film shows a sign mid-way as the girls encounter a major problem. They follow a small passageway further into the cavern. When that hole caves in, the girls must find another exit. Once they discover Juno's secret of being closed in a supposedly uncharted cavern, that's when the terror of being trapped starts to swim deep in their minds. That feeling of hopelessness increases when they discover something sinister awaits them as they continue. They will find that this cavern has lots of paths that stop at deep drop-offs where they will have to rope-climb to get from one place in the tavern to another..it's the only way if they seek to find an exit. Once they begin to rope across from one place to get to the other side, there's a grave discovery..someone had once been in the cave when they find a rope-locking device attached in the rock! They are not the first to have been in this cave and the device they find is over 100 years old! Soon, the true horror begins as they travel inside this portion of the tavern and encounter creatures that seem human, but act anything but. They have the appearance of a possible species of bat. They can only detect movement with sound. They don't seem to have the ability to smell or see. That may be any of the women's only way of combating the evil that longs for their flesh. Yes, these creatures are meat eaters! And, when they eat, they enjoy it with a feverish intensity.Marshall's film is as grim as grim can be. If one group of climbers couldn't make it out, why should the ones we watch escape? There's a glimmering hope when Juno, amongst any that survive the initial carnage that occurs as the creatures run amok on them out of nowhere, finds markings perhaps telling them a possible way out. But, they would have to make it past those creatures which may not have certain senses available, but do move fast and seem to know how to climb all around the tavern.I started thinking about these women who are not victims by choice because they trusted Juno for whom seemed somewhat trustworthy before this situation. I tried to understand their terror. That hopelessness ran deep within me because these unfortunates have been placed in a dire state with little chance of survival.",9,2,7,26 December 2006
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels
","'No money. No weed. It's all been replaced by a pile of corpses'Tom (Jason Flemyng), Soap (Dexter Fletcher), Eddie (Nick Moran) and Bacon (Jason Statham, not quite yet the action star he'd later become) are four of the luckiest men I know. They are always knee deep in trouble, always up s**t creek without a paddle, yet somehow, someway lady luck whores upon their behalf time and again. They decide to challenge 'Hatchet Harry' in a cards game, one with enormous stakes, because Eddie 'reads reactions well', but underestimates the power to cheat.Yep, Harry has his own 'Hatchet Man', Barry 'the Baptist' (nicknamed this because he has a way of dunking heads in water to 'fish for information' when his boss demands the 'goods') who keeps a monitor down stairs and secret cameras which are able to read the cards of those participating in the high-stakes cards game. So even if Eddie might've had the skills to upend Harry if the game was legit, he's s**t out of luck, because Harry is sneaky and underhanded. So Eddie winds up owing Harry 250, 000 pounds and must come up with it in a manner of days. Sting has a snazzy supporting role as Eddie's pops who owns a bar that Harry wants; Harry will take the bar in exchange for Eddie's life.The plot doesn't stop there, no sir, with multiple characters coming into picture, such as a 'Samoan Joe' pub owner (David Reid with a fro, whose character, funnily enough, is actually Samoan Jo!), crooked neighbors who live next to Eddie and the gang (planning to heist a group of pot smoking dealers), and a hapless bunch of marijuana growers whose idea of security is woefully inept. But how two antique guns play into the entire scheme of things is just hilarious. Those two guns lead to all sorts of mayhem—the way they exchange hands you'd think this film was 'Winchester '73'.About the guns, Barry The Baptist hires two bumbling blockheads (who normally steal cars and postal items) to take them from the home of an elderly couple fallen on hard times. The thing is, they were actually told to take weapons from a cabinet (but the guns Harry specifically wants aren't in the cabinet, so the two thieves sell them to 'Nick the Greek', more about him in a moment) and do so. Barry is furious with them and warns the duo to go and get those guns back. Nick the Greek buys and sells contraband, having made deals with Tom over 'merchandise'. Nick sells the guns to Tom. Eddie and the gang plan to rob their neighbors after they rob the dope dealers. Yes, the plot just goes on and on. Keeping up with this movie was quite a feat, I must say, but the characters are fun and in Ritchie's movies they are colorful enough and developed with little quirks and personalities. I can say this: 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' isn't boring! I haven't even mentioned Vinnie Jones, as 'Big Chris' who is Hatchet Harry's 'muscle' (and the icing on the cake is how his son accompanies him on 'missions'!), intimidating as ever, but not without principles (and doesn't tolerate profanity or blasphemy in front of, or from, his son, even though violence is common place in their lives!). At least, in this movie's case, he's not just a violent brute, but does seem to operate with a level of control. Those familiar with Ritchie's style can expect a vibrant and energetic camera style, not to mention, clever methods behind setting up the spiraling-out-of-control plot and the litany of characters who populate this criminal world. Harry seems to be the catalyst--or is it the pot--but, things get out of control with and without his help.",8,0,2,7 August 2011
Three Colors: Blue," Blue
","Julie loses both her famous composer husband and young daughter in a car accident and attempts to free herself from the agony and grief by separating herself from the whole ordeal completely, finding very difficult to do so. To me, besides the gorgeous cinematography and use of the color blue which is very distinctively applied visually throughout, it's all about Juliette Binoche's superb work as a woman trying to suppress feelings of loss and sadness, by cutting herself off from everything that reminds her of the life before the accident. But, every step she takes towards this goal seems futile as the past returns time and again. At first, she does seem liberated, moving to a new building, with the financial resources available to do nothing except live, such as visiting a café to drink her coffee and eat her ice cream, listen to a seemingly homeless talented flute player, swim in a nearby pool, and spend her days with a symphony of sound presenting itself in her mind. It is established that Julie actually helped write the orchestras her husband was held in high esteem for. She later learns that her husband had a lover and this lawyer is carrying his child. Julie was also herself having an affair with an associate of her husband's, himself a musician. This man is truly in love with Julie and so desperately wants to compose a work for the Unification of Europe, but needs her help in order to bring it to life. I think the movie is about accepting a tragedy in order to heal. I don't think one ever can completely free herself/himself from the grief of losing those you love and certainly understand the complex feelings of anger and pain about this unpleasant event that forever changes your life. Binoche is an actress I hold in high regard because I have an affinity for those who can communicate to us without the crutch of dialogue. Sure dialogue can help, but when you can tell us how you feel with very little in the way of words, I, for one(and I imagine I'm not alone), think this says much more of the ability of an actress. Binoche has always been that kind of actress, and that is why I watch a movie if her name is in the credits. I was moved by this movie because the content and central performance connected with me in that I could sympathize with how difficult such circumstances could be when you lose a family and are left alone. You don't want to face those feelings..they are there and I'm glad that eventually Julie does finish the symphony with Olivier(Benoît Régent) and decides to restart a relationship with him. The film also shows how Julie befriends a stripper whose not as base and evil a 'loose woman' as her detractors might paint her as. We also see how Julie's mother's memory is fading and the boy who was present where the crash took place finds her so he can return a necklace and pass on something her husband said before passing away. These people, her mother, the boy, her former lover, the stripper, alter her plans at a new and different life. It is, however, for her own benefit. I do think we want her to be emotionally healthier and embracing life again truly is the way, don't you believe? Two great instances of communicating her inner turmoil are the lollipop and 'hand scraping alongside a wall' scenes. Not to mention, the scenes in the pool when she often contemplates suicide, holding herself underwater, before coming to her senses and re-emerging.",9,0,2,12 June 2010
Zombieland," Zombieland
","It's been a stressful time in my life the last few years, and very few movies seem to entertain as they once did. And, in honesty, there really have been few horror movies of any kind that have left any indelible mark. Zombieland was just what the doctor ordered. While it was inevitable that Zombieland would be compared to Shaun of the Dead(unfairly, I believe), I think this film stands on it's own merits as a really entertaining zombie comedy with pitch-perfect casting.We spend most of our running time with four people as they evade zombies while traveling cross country looking for wherever home may be. Jesse Eisenberg has been really smart in choosing movies and he's just right as a protagonist to center the movie around, a narrative voice to the plague that has depleted his homeland, and how his life was forever changed when he met a rowdy cowboy with a Twinkie obsession, mourning the passing of his 'puppy', 'Tallahassee'(Woody Harrelson). Tallahassee just pulls up in a Caddy, as the two point shot guns at each other in a standoff, not knowing that they would join together on a trek which would unify them. Destroyed cities with decimated vehicles and devastated streets are stops along the way as Columbus(Eisenberg)and Tallahassee become inadvertently involved with two sisters, Wichita and Little Rock(Emma Stone & Abigail Breslin), quite the con artists, who are able to trick them into handing over guns and the Caddy. This chance meeting, in a grocery store as Tallahassee's quest to find the golden Twinkie knew no end, would, unbeknown to all parties, only be the beginning of their times spent warding off zombies and searching for room and board.Zombieland is as much about the bonding of four people whose relationships evolve as they attempt to stay alive, as it is about zombies. The root cause of the zombie outbreak is mad cow disease and the viral freaks are a grotesque bunch with black blood spewing from their mouths as they loot and scavenge for fresh meat. The zombies are often an afterthought, taking a back seat, at times, to the four characters journeys across the nation and their burgeoning friendship.Not overlong, and rather even-paced, with a fantastic cameo when our gang stop off at the Hollywood mansion of Tallahassee's favorite actor. The names of the characters stem from Tallahassee's desire not to become too involved emotionally with those he meets. Harrelson is a riot as the roustabout who may seem to want to remain a loner, when we can tell he has been needing the company of a pal for sometime. Eisenberg is wonderfully cast as a nervous virgin with a host of phobias, who takes a shine to the cute Emma Stone, and Abigail Breslin finally gets a chance to star in an adult movie..his list of ways to protect yourself against zombies is an amusing device throughout the film. Plenty of zombie heads are shot or caved in by large weapons. The theme park finale is a showstopper(..how rides are used to defend themselves against zombies have to be seen to be believed, quite imaginative and clever).The young hottie, Amber Heard, has a small role as a neighbor of Eisenberg's who wishes to crash at his joint after a zombie attacks her, startling him in the morning, withholding a secret that nearly costs him his life. It's no surprise to me this movie was a hit, it has all the ingredients to be successful. Harrelson as a gun-toting bad ass is about all I could really hope, wish, or ask for.",8,0,1,24 February 2010
Die Hard," Die Hard
","Die Hard is what it is: terrorists looking to secure $400 million, hidden in a vault in various ways (stocks, treasures from empires, paintings, etc), hold a partying white collar group of a corporation, celebrating in a long, tall, posh, under-construction, swank high rise in Los Angeles, hostage (including the wife of the heroic cop, John McClaine, from New York City) while a visiting cop, hidden in a bathroom (with no socks/shoes), escapes, becoming a real thorn up their ass, taking them out one by one as their leader (played by the coolly confident, reserved Alan Rickman, who never rattles even as it appears he's in deep trouble when law enforcement (including the FBI) surround the building). That's it. The plot is just enough to allow Bruce Willis to shoot a bunch of people while stacking the odds considerably against him.You get explosions gutting the high rise, windows shattering into debris from gunfire, legs and bodies torn apart by bullets, and machine guns causing plenty of casualties and damage to walls. Willis makes nifty use of C-4 and uses the strap of a machine gun and a fire hose to get out of sticky situations. There's even a brutal scene as a worried Willis pulls glass from the bottom of his feet while telling police officer Al (played by Reginald VelJohnson of Family Matters fame) a message to give to his wife just in case he doesn't make it. This movie has the clichés, including the ridiculous return of a heavy who miraculously recovers from being lynched by heavy chained coiled three times around his throat only to be taken down by a cop who says he will never draw his gun from his holster after an unfortunate shooting of a thirteen year old hood. If you enjoy movies where a heroic cop constantly evades certain death by eluding his adversaries through cunning and brilliant canny to think on his feet (although even he can be somewhat fooled as Rickman is able, for a moment, to trick Willis into thinking he's a hostage; not to mention, he walks into a gun pointing at his face (it's to Willis good fortune that he has made the thug so mad he wants to fight with fists instead of popping a couple rounds in his face), then Die Hard is the gold standard of such movies.Sure, the movie's implausibilities are many, but I embrace these things in an action movie from the 80shell, it is to be expected. A good villain helps and this one's (Rickman) is a doozy. Willis has some great quips and one-liners, putting him in great company along with Arnold and Sly because he able to slide comfortably into such a tough-guy archetype seemingly easily—I found him wholly convincing and exciting to watch. Bonnie Bedelia is expertly cast as an equally tough wife who has become so disenchanted with her husband that she has taken her maiden name back (I got a kick out of Willis' annoyance as he notices her maiden name throughout the building) because Willis wasn't so keen on moving away from The Big Apple to The City of Angels. She, like Willis, is able to buy herself some time, keep her calm when trouble looms, and faces danger without breaking a sweat. Some fun casting for actions fans includes Paul Gleason as a surly asshole (what else but this time of character should one expect from Gleason, he's so reliable as someone who gets under your skin with his attitude) Chief of Police, Hart Bochner as a coke-snorting creep business salesman, and William Atherton as (what else?) a troublesome, success-seeking, self-absorbed news reporter who goes out of his way to get information on Willis, placing him and Bedelia in danger of being discovered. Even though they don't meet until the end, the film hinges on the great chemistry between Willis and VelJohnson who communicate back and forth via walkie talkies during the whole movie. What is rather fascinating about this is the fact that Rickman can listen to their every word. How McClain gets Al's attention with the use of a terrorist's body is a cool action scene fans like me eat up with great joy.",9,1,2,25 December 2011
When Harry Met Sally...," When Harry Met Sally
","Wonderful romantic comedy (one of the best and most memorable from the 80s) focuses on two friends (Harry, a political consultant, Sally, a journalist) who find themselves struggling not to fall in love, attempting to date other people while secretly pining for each other, and soon no longer able to resist the urgings for more than just conversation over long walks and lunches discussing the love-making they could have together. Look, the conversations (with lots of clever and funny banter back and forth, mostly about sex and relationships, what men and women truly think and feel despite what they say and seem to convey) are a major asset between Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan, but the stars' chemistry (this really sets Ryan's career off) is impeccable. I love the quiet discomfort and inability to dismiss their first sexual encounter as a 'mistake', and their New Years Eve confrontation, addressing how they truly feel for each other, was a nice way to close the film, the conclusion fitting and satisfying.With Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher perfectly cast as Crystal and Ryan's best buds, a 'fake orgasm' in a deli (as Ryan (effectively) convinces Crystal that you can fool a man into believing he's successfully pleased his female partner, with the 'I'll have what she's having' line an absolute classic), several early encounters between Ryan and Crystal that has them arguing about 'what men and women really want' (Crystal often just aggravating Ryan, getting her emotionally all out of sorts because mostly what he says is true and she can't accept it), and those passing glances of aching and acknowledgment (I had forgotten just how good Crystal, in particular, was at that; Ryan has a character that tries hard to pass off as if nothing about break-ups and 'mistaken sex' bothers her, but it all eventually spills out when she simply wants a real relationship, meaningful and of depth), as well as, excerpts from real older marrieds commenting on how they wound up together, helped make 'When Harry Met Sally' such an enduring treasure. Include the New York setting as the obviously appropriate backdrop and the likability of the stars amidst it, and why wouldn't this film remain such a valued and cherished romantic comedy?",9,1,1,7 August 2013
Crazy Heart," Crazy Heart
","With a steady diet of booze and cigarettes, aging country music singer, Bad Blake(Jeff Bridges) is so far down the dumps, a career that has seen better days, he's playing bowling alleys. A relic of another era(with music that is far more authentic than what is considered country nowadays), Bad Blake is having a hard time accepting that his protégé, Tommy(Colin Farrell), is a major star, having supposedly 'left him behind'. Broke, four failed marriages, a bad persistent cough, and the rigorous travel accompanying his alcoholism and smoking, all have left Blake in need of some serious therapy. He might just find that in a reporter for a Santa Fe newspaper, Jean(Maggie Gyllenthal), who he meets while being interviewed by her. He bonds with her son, Buddy(Jack Nation)while perhaps falling in love for the first time. But, his alcoholism results in almost losing Buddy in a mall while Bad's getting drunk in a bar, which squanders what could've been a special, quality relationship, which forces him to process his situation in life and acknowledge his failures.What a gift to have Robert DuVall as a bar owner pal of Bad's who offers some moral support and friendship..I was thinking about TENDER MERCIES while watching CRAZY HEART, another simple, honest little movie about a country music singer's rise from the gallows thanks to a woman and her son. DuVall is the kind of actor that brings a smile to the face the moment he appears on screen. Bad helps his Duvall's Wayne out as his bar is suffering economically. Wayne and Bad have been life long buds so it helps that some sort of ear is there to talk to. How cool is it that Jeff Bridges sings the songs in the film himself? You know it'd be easy to label CRAZY HEART an 'Oscar bait' picture, but it's really not a loud, bloated 'look at me' kind of film. I think this is very similar to the aforementioned TENDER MERCIES in many ways..both Duvall's character and Bad have to hit rock bottom in order to dust off their boots and straighten out their lives for the better. What a nice little movie, heart felt performances by all involved, and the story which is a realistic look at life on the road, it's drawbacks and benefits(I mean, Bad Blake is admired by those who attend his performances). I liked how the character of Tommy Sweet always extends an olive branch to his mentor, even if the success has heaped rewards his direction, we see that he has continued to remain appreciative of the man who taught him everything he knows. Going through hangovers, vomit-fits, a car crash, love loss, and being denied the chance to meet a son who doesn't wish to speak with him(after so many years, the bitterness and repulsion of the son's voice is quite potent and understandable), plus other situations deriving from his excesses is humbling and oftentimes hard to watch, but through Bridges' performance we care about him and hope he can pull himself out of the gutter, in spite of his voluntary decisions to do so.",10,2,4,30 June 2010
30 Days of Night," 30 Days of Night
","The tiny community if Barrow, Alaska, are on the verge of 30 long days of night as various citizens head for the airport to get away before the town is overcome with darkness. What the remaining citizenry doesn't expect is an accompaniment of blood-thirsty vampires, ready to feast on the town with a vengeance. Somehow, sheriff Eben Oleson(Josh Hartnett)and estranged wife Stella(Melissa George)will have to band the remaining survivors together awaiting the sunlight to shine once again. But, that will not be an easy task as the vampires will always be on the hunt for fresh victims to supply their blood-lust..I loved the predatory look of the vampires, Danny Huston is terrifying as the leader(..loved that one scene where the big tractor guy tries to blow himself up and Huston's vampire ridicules him as taking an easy way out since his inferior abilities could not match their own), and I found some interesting similarities in tone to John Carpenter's THE THING. I found the opening scene, with the ship afar as their human slave is about to remove the abilities of the town's escape and cry for help, startlingly effective. Love the closing scene as a major character begins to ash as the sun rises. I really like Melissa George. Liked her in the blah AMITYVILLE HORROR remake and found her very good here as well. Hartnett is just too young for his role. He's too handsome, as well. I agree with Leroy..too many attractive folks in a town such as Barrow so removed from society. And, too many 'suggested' gore scenes. I want to see head chopping(..well, maybe not towards the one man, bitten by the girl)and this film delivers it perhaps once..I did like how the film shows that head chopping isn't as easy as you'd think. And, I was never quite convinced of the whole '30 days' concept. I think they would've been a little more worse for wear if they would've been stuck within the confines of such a ravaged town with limited means to sustain them, coupled with an intense fear and little obvious rest considering you have to always keep an eye out for the baddies. Liked that the vampires communicate in a foreign language. My favorite sequence is an aerial shot showing the vampiric rampage on the township as the slaughter commences with lots of screaming and bullet-fire. Love how the vampires are so carnivorous.",6,1,3,9 March 2008
Edge of Tomorrow," Edge of Tomorrow
","Underrated sci-fi opus from Doug Liman provides Cruise with a nifty part as this cowardly 'Military PR Propagandist' and Emily Blunt as this heroic soldier who represents a brave icon for the war against an alien threat that could very well wipe out the human race from existence of the world. When Cruise is placed on the front lines of a ground attack, against his wishes (he tries to flee from the office where Brendan Gleeson's general informed him of his trip on the front lines!), he somehow watches as the battle around him destroys ships and men without harm, his mechanical body weapon suit stuck on safety (!), and only after he gets his arm guns to fire does 'mimic blood' fuse with his own causing him to 'rest' every day after he is killed! Liman takes the story arc and cleverly uses it to the hilt. Think Groundhog Day Meets The Terminator with a little Matrix Revolutions mixed in. There's an Alpha alien that, if destroyed, could be the key for humankind winning the war. Repeating everyday is also familiar to Blunt's Rita as Cruise's Cage soon discovers. The two of them will reset each day, trying to determine how to defeat the alien scourge. Playing with the conventions of time within sci-fi is nothing new, but how Liman is able to use Cruise to recruit the J-troop into helping him is rather neat as is Blunt's developing relationship with him. Blunt, to her credit, has reached that pinnacle in her career where she can share the screen with a real bonafide movie star like Cruise and hold her own. The war scenes with the military and the alien mimics are a real visual feast as are the special effects involving the weaponized military body suits mechanized to kill the mimics from all directions. Cruise, no surprise, anchors the film as this man who develops from absolute spineless weasel to full-fledged soldier of valor and courage. If anything the novelty of Cruise dying over and over gives those non-fans who dislike him a reason to giggle. The only disappointment to me was the night sequences because little can really be seen and they happen at the crucial points of the film. How Bill Paxton's Kentucky drill sergeant is used in the film when Cruise continues to awaken over and over is a hoot. Thankfully Liman knows how to keep the film from feeling repetitive and dull, with an editing style that is specifically designed to accentuate Cruise's dilemma and make him credible when trying to convince others that he actually resets after death over and over without grounding the film to a halt.",9,3,6,2 November 2014
The Conjuring," The Conjuring
","James Wan's mega-hit, seemingly a great movie for October wisely capitalizing on a summer absent much in the way of theatrical horror, can't shake off its influences, such as Amityville Horror, The Exorcist, Poltergeist (there's a static-screen television), and Paranormal Activity. To me, this was basically Wan's contribution to the 'demonic possession/paranormal activity/haunted house' all the rage these days. It concerns a couple in the late 60s/early 70s who would, with the help of a priest and tech crew (well, the cameras and equipment, light bulbs, etc, of that time), research cases of demonic possession for people and cleanse them (or their property) of the horror ailing them. This film features a family of seven under siege by the vengeful spirit of a Connecticut witch lynched on the property (on this creepy tree fit for Sleepy Hollow); this witch possesses mothers and uses them as vessels to kill their children. So the five daughters of the family are in quite a bit of danger, not to mention, their mother will be a possession victim. The house is the real star, to tell you the truth; it looks the part of a 70s Amityville relic (upon '71, the house had aged, with wallpaper, furniture, floor, windows, beds, stairs, a hidden cellar and crawlspace seeming to indicate it had been through years of time's mistreatment, with cob-webbing in the mistakenly discovered cellar and crawlspace indicating more habitation from spiders than humans), and the space involved provides Wan with plenty of room to navigate his camera, following the action of the characters (and spirits) throughout. While using a loud score and sound effects, courtesy of the Hollywood Machine needing to manipulate and manufacture terror from the audience, and descending into The Exorcist Lite, diminishes some of the power of The Conjuring, but the old school, traditional approach is appreciated (especially the use of the dark, and 'what lies around that next corner or behind the next door?'). Atheists will probably find this unbearable as plenty of Catholicism (Christian iconography and dialogue) and spirituality find their way in the script and in how the evil is finally put in its place at the end. The reason you'll see The Exorcist bandied about is mainly because of the end where Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga (Mr. and Mrs. Warren, Demonologist Couple) work to alleviate Lili Taylor's Carolyn Perron of the witch possessing her. The usual crucifixes and holy water show up. Ron Livingston is the trucker husband of Carolyn, Roger, who is feeling helpless in regards to his family's safety. A leg pulled, a demon leaping onto a victim, a victim lifted off her feet by her hair and tossed into a glass-windowed door, the ghost of a maid with slit wrists appearing to scare a guy, a face with flesh ripped away by demon-possessed Taylor, eerie handclaps from a clothing cabinet and in the cellar (ruined by advertisements, leaving the scene without the surprise) during hide and seek games in the house, and Taylor awakened by the witch's spirit while sleeping: in the audience, every one of these moments worked, the theater had people shrieking and freaking out. I give credit where credit's due: Wan builds these scenes, the music helping him (of course), and there's the payoff. If the theater had remained bored and quiet, with phones lighting up and chatting remaining a deterrent, then I would have said The Conjuring was a failure, but the audience was held captivated and spellbound. Whether it was the situation involving a family terrorized by supernatural forces or the gradual escalation of the impending threat itself, The Conjuring worked on the crowd in the theater I saw the film. Too bad the film falls on the sword; Wan's film is reduced to the clichés now so shopworn when it comes to demon possession. The cast is good, though, even if Taylor must work on her best Linda Blair towards the end. Like in Dead Silence, Wan returns to the doll, and there's a marvelous scene where the witch's spirit is creaking in a rocking chair holding the doll, scaring the daughter of the Warrens (yes, another tiresome cliché of the threat towards the heroes' daughter is mined as well). Good opening use of the doll as an introduction to the Warrens, explaining how objects can be used as vessels for evil.",7,1,4,28 July 2013
The Iron Giant," The Iron Giant
","Before The Incredibles and MI: Ghost Protocol, Brad Bird directed this delightful animated feature for Warner Bros about a kid who bonds with a giant robot he finds in the woods outside of his home town. The giant robot seems to be from outer space, feeds on metal, and will not shoot unless provoked or defending itself. And the robot seems to have artificial intelligence that allows it to evolve, learn, and feel. Insidious government agent (voiced by Christopher MacDonald; who better, right?) sets his sights on the robot and wants the military to obliterate it, convincing military general (John Mahoney of Frasier fame) to assist in firing upon it, which puts the boy, Hogard (voiced by Eli Marienthal), in jeopardy. Hogard's harried, single mother is voiced by Jennifer Aniston and the Iron Giant is beautifully voiced by Vin Diesel. Harry Connick, Jr. voices junk metal artist, Dean, who also bonds with Hogard and provides refuge for the Iron Giant at his junkyard. The Iron Giant is a feast for the eyes of fans of comic book robots from the old school. Terrific animation in a very Ray Bradbury-esque small town, including some damn strong storytelling revolving around a boy and a robot that find a friendship full of wonder and awe, caught the attention of critics; this was just a sample of Bird's gifts. The disembodied robot hand following Hogard around in his house while MacDonald's Kent Mansley finds him suspicious and tries to snoop on his activities is a knockout! Best scene could be when Hogard first meets the giant as he rips into power lines and metal structures for nourishment. Also dazzling is a scene involving train tracks as Hogard pleads with the giant to repair it as a locomotive approaches. The way Bird lights the Iron Giant as distantly sinister only to convince us of how harmless he looks and acts when up close speaks about how we should wait before assuming something is dangerous until the evidence presents itself. The ending which has various body parts trying to find themselves in a return to a whole and the Iron Giant sacrificing itself for Hogard makes the heart sing. A special treat. Just wonderful. Cloris Leachman, James Gammon, and M. Emmet Walsh also contribute voices to members of the town.",10,0,1,2 December 2016
Taken 2," Taken 2
","'If the dog has a bone, the last thing you want to do is take it from him.'Well, a need for revenge exists in an Albanian mobster, Murad Krasniqi (Rade Serbedzija), vowing to get even with the man who killed his son. Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) is in Istanbul, protecting a sheik, about to return to the States after performing his duty, greeted surprisingly by his daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace) and ex-wife, Lenore (Famke Janssen), deciding to accept his invite to join him in Turkey for this temporary assignment. Murad and his men arrive in Istanbul with one goal, to kidnap Bryan and his family with plans to execute them all. Bryan is to be tortured and die miserably but not before seeing his wife hung upside down, a slight cut on her neck bleeding out as the rush to her head eventually leads to deaththat was Murad's plan anyway. Funny thing about fighting machines like Bryan Millsthey don't just go down according to plan.The Turkish setting (the rooftops, streets, and old buildings) allows for some excitingly fresh environs, but I have to say that the story goes through the motions, with little time for Liam Neeson the actor to pull us into his emotional crisis. Because there never seems to be a fear that his wife or daughter will perish at the hands of Murad and his Albanian thugs, and Bryan leaves their potential for harm freed from his mind so he can equip himself with the resolve and mental functioning needed to rescue them, Neeson barely has time to even scratch the surface of his acting capabilities and convey the turmoil that should exist in such a dire situation. I think the film's fundamental flaw, however, is the insistence to infuse Maggie Grace into the action; her driving the taxi cab through the populated (and narrow) streets of Istanbul like a trained stuntwoman (despite father's nagging about 'speed up', 'gogo..go', and 'turn rightnow!'), leaping across rooftops like an Olympic champion, and successfully coordinating a perimeter based on Bryan's instructions without a hitch all seem questionable and hard to swallow. And the need for Grace to portray a teenager when she's nearly as old as me (she was born in '83 for crying out loud!), attempting to get her driver's license and dating a boy much to papa's chagrin, is really ridiculous.While I loved watching Neeson go to work because it's 'what he does best', I do believe this should be his second and final film in the role; seeing him with so little to work with (while Damon in the Bourne movies was equipped with some finely realized emotional scenes) was rather frustrating to me. It is cool, sure, to see him walk into a room of thugs and out, them dead in less than 45 seconds, but the film poster offers so much more than Neeson ever gets a chance to provide (sitting in a grueling slumped position of agony and exhaustion, having time to contemplate what's happened, the film doesn't afford him such a luxury). Janssen has a tiny bit of time to openly express her second marriage's crumbling to a sympathetic Bryan, but she's primary held captive in a room with Murad and others threatening her (Murad says he will send her back home in pieces), while Grace insists on helping Daddy get her back. Eventually though, the film allows Bryan to shake off his daughter and take care of the bad guys with his superior fighting skills (hand to hand combat and an exchange of gun fire) and quick reflexes. The film hums when we see bullets almost hit Bryan (who has just enough presence of mind to move in the nick of time) and Bryan use his surroundings as weapons of destruction. Walls and floors are unforgiving when Bryan bounces your body and head off of them with his swift accuracy and sharp martial arts skills. For whatever reason, though, the story itself (or the characters really) never quite match the scenes where Bryan annihilates his foes. It isn't a fault I could blame on Neeson, Janssen, or Gracethe situation they are flung into gives little time (besides hitting the basic points of where the characters are in their lives with seconds-long dialogue scenes) for character development. It becomes a matter of survival and rescue. The taxi cab car chase, leaving behind a lot of vehicular and city structural damage, is a doozy, though. Murad's son may've died horribly at Bryan's hands (thanks to a seated electrocution), but there's very little sympathy for someone kidnapping girls and sending them off to be sex slaves, so the revenge angle is relatively weak...it does give Bryan a reason to wipe out some more lowlifes, so I guess that's all that was needed. This film follows closer to the action films of the 80s where logic and realism take a back seat to bodies smashing and cars crashing, so that alleviates some of the impact an actor of Neeson's caliber can bring to Taken 2. Like others, I view this as a missed opportunity, but its strengths are exciting.",7,0,0,10 August 2013
The Woman in Black," The Woman in Black
","Old school Gothic period chiller, adequately atmospheric, with a genuinely melancholy, tragic, and sufficiently morbid and spooky story, enhanced by the traditionally melodramatic score has a grief-stricken widow (Daniel Radcliffe) sent to the 'Eel Marsh House' to 'settle documents' for her estate,running into locals who want him to leave immediately. Something about the place, and how children continue to die, leaving plenty of sad parents and curiously cold townsfolk who treat Radcliffe as an unwelcome outsider. Radcliffe was told by his boss at the law firm (a rather cold- hearted sort who realizes his employee lost a wife yet warns him of being successful or else in his duties at the Marsh house) to go through all documents/paperwork before coming back, making sure everything's in order. What Radcliffe can't anticipate is a child-killing ghoul dubbed 'the woman in black'. Few are at all kind to him except a grieving man named Arthur (Ciaran Hinds) who lost his son to drowning and has a wife who believes the boy speaks through her. The townsfolk, a 'superstitious bunch' (as Arthur considers them), make Radcliffe's life a bit difficult, feeling he's responsible for any further harm that might befall their township. The Marsh house is a dynamo of art design, with the wallpaper, banisters, doors, furniture, portraits, candelabras, fireplace, windows, and architectural decadence providing the appropriate backdrop for eerie goings-on. The outer design of the house is given a decaying elegance while the inside has enough dispersed lanterns and candlelight to embellish the aging furnishings that give the house its bleak ambiance. There's plenty of the woman's presence in various shots like facial appearances in windows (even a real good one right next to Radcliffe as he looks out a window at the willowy courtyard below), off-distance throughout the house, and in faint glimpses, all done to convey that she's around, not quite dead. The score could be tiresome to those who aren't fond of aural cues meant to make you jump or jar you out of your complacency. Ending is both haunting and beautiful at the same time...the woman in black is driven and rarely fails in her mission to live up to her reputation. Toys, a rocking chair, haggard writing on a wall, the ghosts of dead children in the woods near the house, a cemetery deep in those woods, and even the sight of a hanging ever so briefly: lots of items and visual images to emulate how the woman in black has and continues to make her presence felt. A particularly shocking scene has a girl set herself on fire at the urging of the woman in black: it is one simple motivation for her, and that is to take the children from those that took her boy. The film's chief terrifying scenario has Radcliffe's son arriving to meet him with the nanny by film's end. The usual trappings--the 'marsh', fog, candles only for proper visibility, and the old, dark house--are all accounted for. If you look for these, you're in luck. If you don't...avoid. As most of these movies go: the ghoul could be satisfied if the protagonist can uncover what she so desires. In this film's case: finding the woman in black's son, bringing him to her, and perhaps giving him a 'proper burial.' As to be expected, this film has impeccable lighting and photographic work to add to the gothica.",7,0,1,9 July 2015
The Wolverine," The Wolverine
","In this exciting Wolverine tale, Hugh Jackman returns as the brooding mutant with adamantium claws, still haunted by the loss of his beloved Jean Grey (the goddess, Famke Janssen) whose 'spirit' visits him often in his dreams. He has been hermitting in some rural wilderness (where giant grizzlies and human hunters equally frequent), found while predisposed with barfly hunters (one of whom used a poison-tipped arrow to down a bear) by a highly trained fighter from Tokyo named Yukio (Rila Fukushima). Yukio has orders to bring Logan to Tokyo to 'say goodbye' to her mentor (and the man who raised her), Yashida (Hal Yamanouchi). Logan had saved Yashida's life when Nagasaki was bombed in WWII. Yashida (who had developed a technological empire in Tokyo) is dying and wants to be immortal, offering a chance for Logan to die a human death in exchange for his eternal power. Logan is stunned by this but Yashida supposedly dies not long after the proposition. When Yashida's 'nurse' (a chemist with a vast knowledge in toxins), Viper (the deliciously wicked, luscious Svetlana Khodchenkova, having a field day as the nasty, but delectable heavy) 'poisons' Logan while he sleeps, causing him to feel pain and lose the ability to heal immediately after harm; when wounded, he'll need medical attention. And does he ever bleed and suffer during this movie! Yashida leaves his empire to his granddaughter, Mariko (Tao Okamoto), much to the disgust of his insidious son, Shingen (Hiroyuki Sanada, a nasty piece of work) who himself longed for the lofty power of such a position. There's an attempt to kidnap Mariko by the Yakuza, and Logan will take it upon himself to protect her. It seems everyone is out to either capture or harm Mariko and while vulnerable after Viper's handiwork, the Wolverine will still put up quite a fight, using his claws to full effect. Also showing up in the film is Will Yun Lee as a former childhood boyfriend (and disciple of the house of Yashida), Harada, and the sleazy Brian Tee as the arranged fiancé for Mariko, Noburo. Harada is handy with a crossbow, Noburo has political ties (and a taste for American hookers), and Viper has an agenda that will surprise both Mariko and Logan. Viper likes to use her acidic breath to spread a 'death kiss' or leave marks on those that provoke her anger, even peeling away her skin at one point when suffering a bad fall towards the end. There's plenty of action in the refreshing Tokyo setting: a phenomenal chase through the streets and buildings heading into (and on top of) a bullet train, with Harada scaling atop the rooftops with graceful agility, and the conclusion (into a village that leads to a large fortress) includes ninjas (the roped arrows, some tipped with poison by Harada, sticking from Logan's back is an amazing visual) and a giant Adamantium Samurai Robot, is all kinds of radical. Jackman gets to flex his acting muscles thanks to a plot that allows this character to suffer a wide range of emotional dilemmas. Falling in love with Mariko, while still dealing with the punishing memories of Jean (who beckons him to 'come to her'), enduring his deteriorating physical state due to the multitude of wounds on his torso, addressing his mortality and acknowledging how vulnerable he now is, and having to face enormous obstacles. The scene where he must surgically remove his heart to return to his immortal state, while Yukio tries to fend off a determined Shingen, is a corker. Speaking of Yukio, she's a badass with that kendo stick and can go toe to toe with just about anybody. Yashida's role in the film is a fascinating development that has quite a twist by film's end. But, to quell any doubts of Wolverine's involvement in action, he gets plenty of henchmen to obliterate. Wolverine even gets to swear, which deters this Marvel Comic Book action flick from the possible viewing of little kiddies. Mariko and Logan's blossoming romance is actually not a detriment; in fact, it gives us a chance to see Wolverine humanizedhis aching and potential for a brand new love offers promise for a new lease on life. The credits leads to a scene that fuels anticipation for the next X-Men movie. This is far superior to the previous Wolverine film, and, despite the naysayers who claim this will be a disappointment, I am not alone in the endorsement of this movie...it has a vocal following of positive feedback.",9,18,33,29 July 2013
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Vicky Cristina Barcelona
","Every bit the Woody Allen movie, Vicky Cristina Barcelona is the romantic adventures of two American tourists(Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson) over the course of a summer in Barcelona, how passionate encounters with a Bohemian artist(Javier Bardem)effect their lives for the future forever. Cristina(Johansson), must adjust to a very emotionally fragile ex-wife(Penélope Cruz)who returns to Juan Antonio's(Bardem)home after nearly committing suicide. We also are treated to the situation involving Vicky(Hall)and her struggling to get over that one heated night with Juan Antonio while now married to a wealthy hot shot businessman(Chris Messina)she doesn't truly love. Patricia Clarkson is Vicky's stepmother(..who is in love with her husband's best friend) and tries to steer her towards Juan Antonio, knowing that she doesn't love her husband and has deep feelings for the other man just out of reach.As is a constant in Woody Allen's oeuvre, sex and emotional entanglements regarding love are of great consequence to the characters, except a great deal of this film is narrated, an overlapping voice informing us of the story as the principles' dialogue is drowned out by the one telling us of the difficulties, thoughts and feelings plaguing the stars of the film. Allen fans are accustomed to relationship comedies with characters who do not know what they really want and often swap partners throughout, and this 2008 movie is no different. It is refreshing to see an Allen film, however, in a different location, the beauties of Spain used splendidly as the stories for his characters are explored. I prefer the older movies where the characters have more dialogue and we aren't told almost everything by a narrator, but the cast equip the flavorful surrounding nicely and when they are allowed to speak/act, it is worthwhile, I think. Hall is a nice edition to Allen's family(Johansson has become Allen's new lead actress, this like her third film for the director), and seems to have a meatier role than Scarlett Johansson whose Cristina seems mellow and cool despite having to contend with a volatile Penélope Cruz. Cruz has the flashiest role, a loose cannon whose psyche is tempered as she becomes attached to Cristina, soon forming a loving connection which, for a while, enables the three of them, including Juan Antonio, to form a family of sorts. When you watch a Woody Allen film, you come to an understanding that oftentimes love and real feelings are brushed aside for comfort and complacency as is the case for Vicky who chooses the husband who can offer her a home and money instead of the unpredictable environment of Juan Antonio for whom she carries a serious torch for. Bardem is the handsome Lothario who sweeps everyone off their feet, charming and sensitive. I imagine many viewers will find the characters featured in this film as shallow, self-absorbed and superficial. I think the movie's greatest strength is of the unique relationship that develops between Bardem, Cruz, and Johansson.",6,0,0,8 May 2010
Live Free or Die Hard," Live Free or Die Hard
","NYPD senior detective John McClane(Bruce Willis) must deal with cyber terrorists who are shutting down major cities along the Eastern seashore and, with a hacker, Matthew Farrell(Justin Long) wanted by the FBI(..he's responsible for a certain code which has aided the terrorists), must stop them. Thomas Gabriel(Timothy Olyphant) is the scorned computer genius(..he attempted to warn the government of how vulnerable America is of an cyber attack, through unpopular means only using a lap top, leading to his dismissal) leading the team of terrorists whose operation is to withdraw all the financial data from government networks, with hired gunmen, equipped with the latest hi-tech weaponry at their disposal, out to kill McClane or anyone else in their way. McClane and Farrell will have to assist each other in order to combat a seriously dangerous enemy who have incredible abilities using technology as their weapon. McClane is the brawn(..using his instincts and determination to avoid constant attacks on his life)and Farrell is the brains(..a brilliant tech-savvy kid whose knowledge comes in handy when faced with undoing Gabriel's handiwork). Eventually, as these actioners often do, McClane's own daughter, Lucy(Mary Elizabeth Winstead)will be kidnapped by Gabriel as a bargaining chip, putting extra pressure on him as he attempts to stop these criminals.I didn't think it could be done, but the filmmakers were able to make Live Free or Die Hard even more outrageous and preposterous than Die Hard With a Vengeance..not an easy feat. You have bridges collapsing while McClane, driving a semi, dodges the firepower from a f35 jet(..oh, and how he is able to use the jet to escape certain peril must be seen to be believed!). There's the amazing sequence in the tunnel where McClane and Farrell narrowly avoid cars spiraling towards them. McClane is able to use a vehicle to cut a chopper right into. Even a smaller scale action sequence where McClane must escape constant gunfire in Farrell's apartment as gunmen surround them(..McClane was simply supposed to escort Farrell to headquarters where gunmen were sent to kill Farrell because of his involvement with Gabriel)will have most saying to themselves, 'Yeah, right.' I have to say the major sequence where Gabriel has all the traffic lights turned green with miles of vehicles halted(..as well as a fake destruction of the White House as citizens are shocked to silence)in DC is as impressive as I've seen in those Hollywood disaster pictures. McClane, the poor guy, is always one false step away from certain death, yet he's hard to kill. His resourcefulness is beyond amazing..one of our great action heroes. As any exciting action film should be, Live Free or Die Hard never lets you catch a breath as McClane and Farrell move from one difficult situation to another, having to interrupt Gabriel's mission to swindle the country by using our technology as a tool. Maggie Q has another nifty supporting role as a 'kung fu bitch' who causes McClane a lot of hurt, and their battle escalates into bravura fashion with a SUV driven down an elevator shaft! The use of technology wonderfully contrasts with McClane, an old school cop taken aback by the 'cyber-speak' often used by Farrell. I thought Winstead, though not used until the final thirty or so minutes, is quite effective as McClane's daughter, eliciting traits similar to her old man. Good chemistry(..Willis always seems at home when partnered with a sidekick)between Willis and Long, their differences actually enhance the relationship while trying to save the world.",7,0,0,21 June 2009
A Nightmare on Elm Street," A Nightmare on Elm Street
","'Whatever you do, don't fall asleep.' A Word of Warning:This user comment is for those who have seen the film.You know, I often take away the memorable frightening images when watching this film, but this particular viewing had me focusing on something else..the ending. If you think about it, the entire film until that baffling final scene is one long nightmare. I was trying to wrap my head around it, because it seems we often overlook this very story arc. I always just told myself, that these four teenagers were being stalked by a nightmare slayer, whose perhaps targeting the children of those who burned him alive. But, it's all(supposedly) a scary concoction in the realm of Nancy's(Heather Langenkamp)sleep. I'm not sure if I just woke up from being under a rock or what, but it was something that startled me. Then the ending comes(..from what I understand, this confusing conclusion was set up by Craven as a favor to producer Shaye who was hoping to benefit from a sequel, and boy was rewarded!)and I was once again, as I always am, left with my jaw swinging open. I'll never truly make sense of that final scene, but Craven leaves enough lasting nightmarish images to take away that I'm completely satisfied each time I watch it. The shocking murder of Tina, sliced across the stomach, blood all over the place, dragged up the wall and across the ceiling. Then later, Tina in a body bag(yikes!)calling Nancy's name, later seeing her body, in bag, being drug across the school hallway leaving a blood trail. The invisible hanging of Tina's thuggish beau Rod(Nick Corri)in his jail cell, locked up as the one responsible for what Fred Kreuger did to her. The monumental death scene of Johnny Depp's Glen, pulled into a void in his bed(..television in tow)with a gushing water fall of blood erupting like a geyser throughout the ceiling and room. The imaginative occurrences which terrorize Nancy(..the telephone-tongue gag, the quicksand steps, the bladed glove slowly creeping from between her legs as she lies in her bath tub nearly asleep). Maybe Craven's overall product has flaws which seep through, but he provides so much to make your skin crawl. What playful ground Craven has to operate his ghoulish tricks..the nightmare world provides such freedom to kill innocent teens anyway you wish, as they run for their very lives with nowhere, it seems, to escape. A 'filthy child murderer' who would brings kids to a boiler room to kill..certainly not the hero many would cheer down the road. Interesting, isn't it, that we often forget the evil fiend he really is. Craven gives this psycho free reign to torment and terrorize, the idea is certainly scary if you think about it. And, as far as Nancy, I was doting on the idea that this film is almost entirely(..if not entirely, depending on your opinion with that crazy finale)inside her nightmare, regarding her parents. Interesting that her mom is an oddball drunk and her dad is always gone. They rarely have anything nice to say to each other, and one can sense that this is in the nightmare for Nancy to deal with..a daughter bothered by the separation of her parents and how her mother deals with it through downing alcohol. And, it's always nice to see Freddy before he was the jokey psycho-clown. You rarely ever get a full glimpse of his face, he's the epitome of a prowler in the shadows who is always near yet hard to find..until it's too late, and you are caught in his grip. While I think the Shoulder's 'Freddy's Revenge' has the scariest incarnation of Freddy, he's certainly given moments in Craven's film..such as that one scene where his arms stretch wide as he comes towards Tina, or when he 'stretches' through a wall spying on Nancy. And, the smashing sequence where he elastically stretches from the center of a bed after 'carrying away' Nancy's mom into some sort of abyss, ripping open the sheet from behind his arch nemesis who has seemingly figured out his ultimate weakness..he preys, like many a predator, on the quarry's fears. If one doesn't fear him, then he's vulnerable. Anyway, the film is always a roller coaster ride I hate to get off of..maybe it doesn't scare the hell out of me as it did when I was a kid, but I appreciate and admire the creativity and imagination Craven's supernatural slasher has.",9,0,2,12 August 2008
Casino," Casino
","Gargantuan epic(some critics and Scorsese fans considered it his 'failed epic')about mob-run Las Vegas focusing on casino 'boss' De Niro, his flashy junkie wife Sharon Stone, and volatile 'muscle', Joe Pesci, how they had it all and squandered it due to their own faults and frailties. De Niro, without a legal license to run a casino, was able to run operations of a specific casino successfully with help from city commissioners, and, most importantly, major Midwest mobsters who skimmed from the 'counting room' in order to allow him his opportunity to earn lots of money and live a life of luxury. Pesci was the mob's go-to-guy when they needed people whacked or kept in line, anyone who threatened to take from the mobsters what they considered theirs. Pesci is feared, but unstable and ill-tempered, and soon his presence in Las Vegas wasn't wanted, his criminal activities catching the attention of the police and FBI out to put him behind bars. Sharon Stone is alluring and attractive to De Niro, but she's involved with a lowlife pimp(played by James Woods)and unable to let him go. Stone has the looks and personality that benefits De Niro, helping him bring in the right kind of people to profit from in his casino. But her drug habits and alcoholism(not to mention, her inability to relinquish her love for Woods who is manipulating her to give him money behind De Niro's back)slowly over time ruin the marriage and this deterioration places her in the arms of Pesci! Scorsese's film is, as you'd expect, very detailed and the screenplay quite elaborate in the inner-working of the criminal enterprise ran by the mob who used wiseguys as their eyes and ears in Las Vegas. We see how De Niro and Pesci's personalities bring about their downfall, and Stone's addictions lead to a tragic conclusion. With all the money, clothes, and jewelry, Stone couldn't find happiness, agonizing in a joyless marriage to a man she never loved to start with. De Niro, as much as he was skilled at making money for his mobsters, couldn't help himself when it came to Stone and running such an efficient casino that he couldn't appease the city commissioner to allow his dumb-as-dirt brother-in-law(Joe Bob Briggs, inspired casting)a small position. Pesci's explosive, corrosive temperament, and unwillingness to play by the rules when it come to behaving in casinos, meant that he was doomed to eventually be discarded by his superiors. As was the case in GOODFELLAS, CASINO has startling scenes of brutal violence as the FBI get the pinch on a stupid mobster goon who gave up the names and subject matter of his people with the old-time gangsters setting in motion the executions of anyone who might rat them out. Watching the glamorous Stone unravel by film's end is disheartening and rather pitiable, going from elegant and stunning to washed-out and browbeaten, the drugs and booze turning her into a hobbling, malevolent, blabbering misfit. We see Pesci stab a man with a pen for cursing De Niro, shoot a woman while eating her supper, and bash poor Don Rickles across the face and skull with a telephone..it's not surprising what his character's outcome is. De Niro, though, because he's such a money-making machine, might escape a grim fate, although Scorsese opens the film with him in a car that blows up. Scorsese leans heavily on voice over narration from both De Niro and Pesci who explain the ways things were run in Las Vegas before the corporations took over. Clocking in at 3 hours, CASINO is certainly long-winded, and I'm not sure these are the kind of characters one wants to spend this amount of time with, but I found the story Scorsese brings to light compelling enough to withstand the entire journey.",7,1,2,16 January 2011
50_50," 50/50
","I think what makes 50/50 such a success is the film doesn't ever feel like it needs to manipulate your emotions, as many a movie about cancer falls prey to, instead just looking at a life through a realistic lens from the perspective of a young man (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) having to deal with a tumor growing on his spine. He has an obscene (but totally loyal) buddy played by Seth Rogan, always drunk, hitting on girls, and swearing (when not smoking pot and trying to convince Gordon-Levitt to go to bars with him), a sham of a girlfriend (played by Bryce Dallas Howard, stuck with a character so self-absorbed, with a personality ill-equipped for giving care and affection to someone in need of both, that she has no chance of escaping the 'bitch we love to hate'; it does provide a moment of great humor when Gordon-Levitt tells her to get of his porch, soon joining Rogan in destroying her painting that once hung above the television), a psychiatrist working on her doctorate and a bit inexperienced (Anna Kendrick, becoming quite a character actress; if she could just avoid the 'Pitch Perfect' films, I think the sky's the limit) who is becoming a possible new love interest, an overprotective mother (Angelica Huston, just wonderful) who just wants her son to return her phone calls (and make him dinner if he'll let her) he's embarrassed by, a father now lost to senility, and a couple of fellow cancer patients (Matt Frewer and Philip Baker Hall) who understand his situation all too well. Learning of the cancer (I think there's a great bit of cinematography here were the focus of the cancer doc's face (still speaking of the rarity of such cancer in someone of his age) eventually fades with Gordon-Levitt having to let this news sink in), cutting of his hair (with Rogen's shaver which could have been used for his body hair), dealing with a cheating girlfriend that abandoned him when he needed her the most (caught at her art gallery with a hippie by Rogan who snaps a photo on his phone), trying to avoid as much of revealing his pent up emotions to his psychiatrist yet finding her presence in his life a gradual help, facing the fears of dying and the eventual delicate and dangerous surgery, and ultimately blessed with a new outlook on life (and perhaps love). This is indeed uplifting but not in the usual Lifetime/Hallmark channel way; the dialogue is frank and profane, emotional outbursts (or scenes where Gordon-Lewitt is sick and too tired to stand) aren't overdramatized with a heavy score, and there's plenty of adult comedy that can offset the grim diagnosis that heavily looms throughout. Rogan is playing another version of himself; using the cancer to pick up girls, boozing and oftentimes drunk, blunt and viewed as obnoxious (and not without plenty of dirty jokes and salty language), this character doesn't stray from Rogan's comfort zone. Yet he's there for his friend all the way. Gordon-Levitt proves here, significantly, that he's among the best actors of his generation. Scary is I think he still can get even better.",8,9,9,22 June 2013
What We Do in the Shadows," What We Do in the Shadows
","A documentary crew follows vampires (who are flatmates in a New Zealand city) during their nightly routines, capturing them as they awaken, hunt for human food, attempt to get in clubs, opening up about themselves in interview segments, how they react to werewolves, their messy situations during bloody feedings, prepare for an 'unholy masquerade', befriend an IT computer analyst (human) they bond with while the one that introduced him to them (recently turned) becomes a major nuisance, and contend with the dangers of their undead secret getting out where it shouldn't. Clever, witty, with a sense of humor; this fun little gem turns both the vampire genre and found footage genre on their head.Two of the most popular horror subgenres merging in a fine synchronicity with some amusing observations caught on camera: (a) how the vampires deal with two cops who answer a call about disturbances, (b) a human young man that was supposed to only be food for the vampires to feed from being kept alive by the oldest vampire of the flat really often wearing out his welcome due to his big mouth, telling practically anyone who would listen of his status as a bloodsucker, (c) how protecting a human becomes increasingly difficult, especially at a party room full of vampires just ready to go into a blood-drinking frenzy, (d) how flying around might be cool but it could lead to being seen by the wrong onlookers, (e) how a patient human slave has been waiting for her master to turn her, cleaning up the bloody messes, ironing their clothes, mowing their lawn, even dutifully selecting humans to be lunch for the vampires (!), (f) being introduced to the internet, a vampire's forlorn desire to being romantically tied to a woman he followed to New Zealand, eventually winning her 96 year old heart (!), (g) how being around werewolves when the full moon emerges in the sky is not a good situation for even vampires (or camera operators with the vampires!), and (h) the awful results of a vampire eating chips which has quite the back alley vomit.A documentary about vampires, their habits and behavior night to night, and conveying their unique, distinct personalities, particularly when talking to the camera (and, essentially, us, the viewing audience), offers some insight into where they came from, what they expect, and the positives and negatives for having eternal life but being restricted by the limits that come with the 'undead lifestyle'. The passive, inert Stu, the welcomed human among the vampires (who speak candidly and nonchalantly about their killing humans for the blood they need to satiate their appetite), is quite a sight among the more chatty, vocal vampires who never fail to embellish or distance themselves from the camera and what it entails. The special effects are good when depended upon (Nick's inability to conceal his newfound vampirism, and his taking flight; an actual 'batfight' between Nick and rival Deacon (who thinks Nick is 'stealing his style', and the luring of an actual vampire hunter to their domain results in the sunlight death of one of their own; the vampires being everywhere in their flat as Nick tries to escape them before being turned by Max Schreck-lookalike, Petyr; Viago's always hitting the main artery causing bloody messes), but it is the cast that makes this a real treat. Petyr, whose appearance is modeled after Schreck (from Nosferatur) or Reggie Nalder (of Salem's Lot), is genuinely scary, but how the film even gets humor out of him, in just the way he differs in personality to the others (he stays mostly in his basement, and when Viago attempts to talk with him, he gets a shriek), those who made this film deserve kudos. Vlad's diminished power due to a romantic split that left him damaged is certainly amusing when he tries to render others under a spell, failing miserably. But it is how the film is shot as a document of these unique characters that gives this a significant charm.",7,0,1,27 February 2016
Deadpool," Deadpool
","Vulgar, hip-centric, and purposely anti-hero comic book Marvel outing gives Ryan Reynolds exactly the kind of 'super hero' (using that term rather reluctantly) part his career has been pining for. While this could very well be an ideal villain if tweaked, Deadpool seems to be a perfect alternative to the kiddie-family friendly Marvel summer fare so popular every year. He's feisty, insulting, cocky, abrasive, relentlessly chatty, honest-to-no-fault, keen to jump into danger at any moment (particularly with 'mutant powers'), opportunistic (if he can get his revenge, no one will stand in his way), and unafraid of any consequences of any of his actions. He was 'in the war' (special forces) so his killing/fighting talents have reason. He's not an 'altogether bad guy' as he is willing to risk it all to save his 'potential baby's mama', but not before cracking wise and pulverizing heavies that follow behind this mutant that is impervious to pain (he can't feel 'anything') named Ajax (Ed Skrein). Ajax was head of an underground 'let's change hopeless human bums in need of help into mutant superheroes' project that had this suit with a faux sense of offering support to the downtrodden luring unfortunates into a warehouse that features a staff who seem content to pump them full of mutant goo and torture the change into effect! Ajax's suit convinces Cancer-stricken Wade (Reynolds) to give the mutant underground project a chance, and it leaves himwell, worse for wear. An oxygen deprivation tank encourages the mutant change on Wade which uglies his entire body. Going the Elephant Man route provides Wade with a modicum of sympathy, but I guess his mouth could hinder that somewhat. Let's just say that this film unleashes some pent-up frustration that comes with trying to offer a product to a wide audience, within a PG-13 rating. What many might perceive to be a niche Marvel character audience, Deadpool seems to be the answer to a certain demographic's prayers. There's a freeing feeling you can see in this film, with all the swearing, sex-obsessed dialogue, decapitated heads, direct-to-camera-fourth-wall-breaking, 80s music (Chicago and Wham! make appearances!), playful jabs at the X-Men (metallic muscle Colossus & firebrand Negasonic Teenage Warhead lend some help to Deadpool by film's end), Stan Lee's cameo in a strip club (!), and going for a completely off-the-wall back-and-forward origin story. Reynolds' energy and sheer exuberance (he is having so much fun and seems to be totally turned loose from the chains that bound him in 'Green Lantern') give the film a buzz it sustains all the way through. Thankfully, he's never a buzzkill. Ajax is your basic cold-blooded villain who looks like someone Jason Statham is trying to outrun/outlast in a Transporter movie, with Gina Carano as his intense and mighty lieutenant (she gives Colossus quite a run for his money!). This is all about Reynolds and his blunt-force-object honesty and sense of humor. The quips are exhaustive, there's no shortage of Marvel vehicular carnage and explosions, epic encounters between fighting heroes and villains are here and accounted for, and even the friends treat each other rather harshly (Wade and his bartender buddy, Weasel (TJ Miller) share an exchange which doesn't politely hold back how Deadpool's new looks are a detriment to him; and a blind, black lady living in the slums who provides him a place to stay shares the oddest of friendships with Wade). This film's big box office has proved that Marvel could make a R-rated superhero film and it be successful. Look for the next film to be even more graphic, explicit, and against type. Deadpool's resistance towards the X-Men philosophy and how he corresponds with Colossus and the teenage firestarter were my personal favorite parts. Reynolds found his winner. Almost pulls out all the stops including quite the inspired opening credits which gleefully ribs the stereotypes of the comic book movie.",8,6,17,20 February 2016
The Hangover Part III," The Hangover III
","The Hangover Part III receives critical derision for being a violent, dark sequel that has suctioned away all the charm, unpredictability, and hilarity significant to the first film's success. I think the problem with the third film is that at every turn, despite what the film seems to want from us, Chow is a cretin, a creep with no redeeming qualities yet he's set up as this lovable Bangkok nutcase with an ability to leech trust from his victims. I think Chow is a monster, but he's so prominently featured in this third film, I had no choice but to tolerate him. Look what he does to even those who are remotely humane to him: he locks them in the basement after stealing gold he claims was in his own villa basement but is actually kingpin Marshall's (John Goodman) second stash of bars, leaving them to be punished. Two caches of bars were stolen from a sheik by Marshall, and subsequently, Chow took one from him, and then this crazy maniac sets up a con over Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms), and his close pal, Alan (Zach Galifianakis) to get the second! Phil, Stu, and Alan are put under orders by Marshall to find Chow and the gold or else, Doug (Justin Bartha), the brother-in-law of Alan, would be executed! Chow is responsible for all of what befalls the 'wolf pack', and by film's end, despite what he deserves, Alan sees that he escapes from a harm he had more than earned. People get shot a bunch in this film, and the crimes that intrude upon the lives of Phil, Stu, and Alan aren't as much played for laughs as a necessary custom to how these guys fall prey to horrors of an absurd variety time and again. I think seeing Chow leap from the balcony of Caesar's Palace, as a parachute guides him in the sky, talking about how he loves cocaine, isn't as hilarious as it is telling regarding what kind of waste of space he really is. Is he fun-loving, embracing life and all its jollies, using whatever means are at his disposal, through treachery, chicanery, back-stabbing, and madness supposed to endear him to us? Anyway, Stu spends most of his time under attack from Alan, as the film is damn insistent on keeping its focus and intentions on Alan's crisis (the giraffe incident, going off the drugs he needs to keep him from such incidents, speaking out of turn to his relatives, causing his dad to croak from a coronary, etc.). Phil must be the anchor that keeps everything from totally spiraling out of control. Arizona ends up leading to Tijuana and then to Las Vegas, but the results are the samethe wolf pack are re-acquainted with Marshall regarding Chow. Chow. Chow. Chow. Alan. Alan. Alan. At least Melissa McCarthy shows up as a pawn store owner that Alan fancies. Oh, and seeing Alan near death on the Caesar's Palace light was only a disappointment in that he didn't stay there...that or fall to a very sidewalk-crushing demise. It appears that the third film was supposed to be it, yet the end credits tell us otherwise. I hope I never see Chow's dick again.",4,0,1,7 September 2014
Fantastic Four," The 4
","The supposed bread and butter of this film's premise as promised is the Fantastic Four doing battle with Doom. That occurs for like ten minutes at the tail end of the movie. What we get are a modicum of visual effects that are moderately successful. Lots of cars get thrown around in this movie, that's for sure.The synopsis, or what there is of it, consists of five people going into space(it's that easy when you are wealthy like Julian McMahon to just up and go to space when you feel like it)to find cures and stuff for disease. They encounter some sort of life force entity which gives each of them powers beyond what mortal man can possibly imagine.Ioan Gruffudd is Reed Richards, the nerdy shy scientist whose job at NASA sent him into bankruptcy with pal Michael Chiklis as Ben Grimm..always watching his friend's back through all the heartache. Jessica Alba is Sue Storm, Reed's ex who still carries a torch for him. She has been working under the millionaire Victor Von Doom(what a name, huh?), played by Julian in all his menacing glory. Julian is indeed the only real thing this film has going for it with the exception of the harrowing bridge sequence caused by a man who planned to jump off of said bridge. To close out the group is Chris Evans as Johnny Storm, a cocky, self-assured pretty boy who is to pilot the ship to space. I'm surprised he had enough brains to pilot his car on Earth much less some ship into space.Anyway, after the crew encounters the anomaly in space, Reed's limbs become tender and he can now stretch them for miles and miles, Sue can make her entire body invisible, Johhny can turn his body into a flying fireball, and poor Ben forms into this huge rock creature. Victor's body is slowly growing into steel while also carrying a unique ability to shift electrical current with his hands.Victor, who loses money from his company for his funding the space fiasco, lets lose on his boss who tells him he's finished, and once he sees that Sue, who he has a thing for, is still in love with Reed, DOOM will soon come upon The 4.The film opens sappy story lines like the whole love angle between Reed and Sue, Thing's unbearable hardship with how he looks, and sister trying to stop fire torch brother from enjoying his unique abilities. Reed is trying desperately to solve the riddle behind how to change everyone back to their original normal form, but brick walls seem to always stand in front of him. Meanwhile, Doom likes his increasing power and will tool his resources to try and unleash a flurry of rage against those who sent him into financial ruin.",5,0,1,3 November 2006
Pineapple Express," Pineapple Express
","Absurdly violent marijuana drug comedy about two dope-head losers (a process server and his goofy, easy-going dealer) who are on the run after Dale (Seth Rogan) sees cheeky drug-lord, Ted (Gary Cole) murder a rival drug dealer and heads to the abode of Saul (James Franco) wondering what to do considering what he seen. Ted has a cop girlfriend, Carol (Rose Perez), in with him, and they send out two gunmen (Craig Robinson and Kevin Corrigan) to take both Dale and Saul out. The film follows the duo's resistance to dying at the command of Ted and avoiding Carol (a dirty cop her peers are unaware of). Soon Dale and Saul meet up with fellow drug middle man, Red (Danny McBride, with a character that just won't die no manner how many times he's shot), and even Dale's own teenage girlfriend, Angie (hottie, Amber Heard, a joke the film plays to the hilt when she is compared to anti-hunk Rogen) and her family are endangered. You have two rival drug gangs (Cole and Koreans) getting involved in a blood feud, with Red finding himself unwittingly dragged into the misfortunes of Dale and Saul. Pot jokes abound and the violence is often so funny because it happens so clumsily and hap-hazardly. Rogen and Franco's chemistry has never been questioned and this film here seems to be their gold standard. A cast of great names turn up in small parts including Begley Jr. and Nora Dunn as Heard's bewildered and angered parents, puzzled at why their daughter would have anything to with Rogen. Cole, at this point, was having quite a career resurgence, adding this to his resume of comedy surprises like Office Space. This film is obscenely violent as drug wars have a tendency to be with the Rogen/Franco/McBride house-destroying slugfest and the climactic pot-underground decimation both prime examples using over-the-top displays of the damage that guns can do to the human body (what the characters don't do to themselves with whatever tools of violence can't be utilized such as a dirt devil, commode top, bong, fire extinguisher, and coffee pot). Startling still is the director of this film being David Gordon Green, known for his superior indie dramas like George Washington and All the Real Girls (and the underrated Undertow). The profanity, so consistent here, is very much a staple of Apatow comedies. The way the actors hurl themselves into their parts and letting it all go in the action is quite eyebrow-raising. Franco easily takes the film, though, I think, as I have always felt Rogen goes too overboard too often...Franco is the balance as McBride also is very much a Rogen comedy actor. How everyday characters find themselves in the crux of a bad situation produces the comedy results that makes this film work.",7,1,1,26 December 2014
Spectre," Spectre
","James Bond (Daniel Craig) has finally made his way to the terrorist organization called Spectre, a uniform group with its members from all over the world, led by Blofeld (Christoph Waltz) who has a personal connection to the 007 agent. After an unsanctioned trip to Mexico City to stop a member of Spectre from using a bomb that would have been set off in a stadium full of people, which is accidentally exploded in a building containing terrorists, James Bond must answer for doing so without authorization from M (Ralph Fiennes), suspended from duty. However, Bond isn't mindful of such a penalty as time off, and instead follows orders from his former boss (Judi Dench) who had sent him a recording prior to her death...this is what initiated Bond's mission to Mexico City, which was only a start to what lied ahead. MoneyPenny (Naomie Harris) and Q (Ben Whishaw) reluctantly align themselves with Bond although their division in the British MI6 is rumored (and eventually are notified) to be shut down by a dangerous idealist, 'C' (Max Denbigh, played by Andrew Scott), on the verge of forming an alliance with global powers in an effort to set up a spy network supposedly to 'protect us all across the world'. Max's agenda, however, could very well be sinister if implanted. Meanwhile, Blofeld has special plans for Bond who is trying to locate and eventually protect the daughter of a former member of Spectre, named Madeleine Snow (Léa Seydoux). Bond wants to find Blofeld and Blofeld has envisioned the opportunity to meet him, and 'Spectre' brings them together. As you might expect, eventually their meeting would be rather explosive.The Mexico City sequence opens 'Spectre' with an absolute bang, as a building crumbles and collapses which winds up being eerily reminiscent to 9-11, and seeing Bond nearly perishing as his own building is took out by the domino effect is directed so magnificently, I can just hear the oooos and aahhs. Director Mendes' camera follows Bond in what seemed like an extended uninterrupted shot during the Day of the Dead in Mexico City as the locals are all in costume, and 007 walks into a hotel with an attractive woman on his shoulder, in a room that had a window that leads to a ledge he walks directly to a spot which is a direct bead to a room containing the Spectre member he is targeting for termination. This whole opening set piece ends with Bond and his quarry moving through a crowd in the city during the celebration until both are fighting in a chopper over the crowd! The battle between Craig and former pro-wrestler Batista in a train (after the latter leads a car chase after Bond during a high speed affair in Rome which itself is a thrill ride) with Seydoux getting involved, and the headquarters of Blofeld going up in flames thanks to a watch that packs a punch (Q provided to Bond prior to fleeing to Rome despite orders from M to stay in London), as it appears Bond's gig is up (he's bolted to a chair as Blofeld plans to use small drills to torture Bond through commands into a computer), are highlights. Also featured is Bond chasing after Batista and some of Blofeld's henchmen who kidnap Seydoux from her clinic in Austria by way of a plane (they in SUVs) and Bond needing to rescue Snow from the set-to-be-demolished MI6 building in London before it detonates (thanks to Blofeld who suffers a nasty scar on the side of his face, ruining his eye). Waltz, no surprise, knocks it out of the park as Blofeld, the ultimate nemesis of Bond, sociopathic and stone cold when it comes to doing whatever is necessary against 007 and to gain global power. The way Blofeld reminds Bond of how he has killed all those he loves over and over truly emphasizes his cold blooded nature.Waltz is a good casting choice for the villain, confident and smooth, but his Blofeld's obsession with bond ultimately is his downfall. Batista has the right brutish body type perfect for a bruising heel used to give Bond a hard timenot needing to talk, he has this intimidating presence that is important to the role he is cast. Fiennes getting to play hero at the end when facing off with Scott is a treat, as well. Scott is one of those who manipulated his way into a prominent position, using that power as an intentional nuisance to M and his team.",8,0,2,13 December 2015
Moon," Moon
","Sam Rockwell, in a tour de force performance, stars as an astronaut, preparing to go home after spending three years on the dark side of the moon, working on the base, harvesting sun-bathed rock, shipping the material home to Earth as an energy-efficient resource. After an incident involving a rover crash, Sam Bell(Rockwell)discovers that he has a clone(..the clone found him unconscious in the rover)and the two of them uncover startling truths about what happens to them after their three-year mission is over. Starring in dual performances, able to successfully craft two completely different, distinctive characters despite their being clones from the same person, Sam Bell, Rockwell deserves all the credit in the world, somehow pulling off the incredibly difficult task of carrying a movie almost entirely by himself. Accompanying such a sterling accomplishment are the visual/special effects, sets, models, computer graphics, all shot in Shepperton Studios, stellar, fantastic work from all involved. The score perfectly relates the situation both Sam Bells face, their mood and environment presented to us in a sombre, depressing way. Kevin Spacey is the voice of Gerty, a robotic machine(..with a smiley face)who sees to Sam Bell's every need, both physically..and emotionally. Spacey's voice is soft and articulate, gentle and warm, and it's this tone that Sam Bell needs in order to remain suitably sane and controlled. The film's primary aspect of suspense is the eventual arrival of three astronauts from the Lunar Incorporated, sent to kill the Sam Bell clones for having discovered each other. Throughout the remainder of the film, it is often reminded to Sam Bell(s)..and us..that they are due to arrive at so-and-so hours. Moon has a very definitive message about human cloning and how those created are people, with souls, feelings, and a desire to live. Like Sam Bell(s), we ourselves go on a journey of discovery, and understand why they covet life and human contact, how isolation breeds desperation and longing for home. A key development is the older clone Sam's deteriorating health condition, coughing up blood among other things. If you love the NASA white art direction, then Moon is certain to make you salivate, it did me. The comparisons to 2001 are bound to surface.",8,3,6,24 January 2010
The Pursuit of Happyness," The Pursuit of Happiness
","The ultimate portrait of human suffering, the epitome of Murphy's Law, a human dartboard of life, and a human version of Balthtazar..that's what this character is in the film. This film is the type of crowd-pleasing Oscar-fodder that Hollywood has been churning out of the machine for ions. All Chris Gardner wants to do is find a job, have a decent place to live and raise his son. He's a nice, hard-working, nose-to-the-grindstone kind of moral hero who goes through every agonizing thing imaginable in a job-less world of the early 80's big city. Extremely well acted by Will Smith as Gardner, a salesman who desperately wants to make an internship happen for a brokerage firm. What he faces, possible poverty and the downs and more downs of making ends meet when there's no income lining Chris' pockets is shown in this film. Audiences have ate these kinds of films for years watching a man persevere against so many odds with a humongous stacked deck which seems to tower over Chris like a dark, looming thundercloud that doesn't like him.",Null,0,0,6 April 2007
Draft Day," Draft Day
","I really am amazed that Costner is still right out there as the star of films and not instead settled into the supporting actor parts that typically begin to collect in his career at this point considering his age. Star power is star power, charisma is charisma, I guess. You know, for a guy who never 'overreaches' as an actor, he just remains so watchable and compelling to me. Draft Day really held my attention. I was rather surprised it did. Think of it as a few days in the life of a manager of a football team, a struggling-for-ages football team with a fanbase dying for success. He has to endure intolerance from the owner, his new coach, current quarterback (who returned from injury and is not happy with his 'fall from grace'), and learning of a pregnancy from his current lover (and 'numbers cruncher'). His father recently passes (a legend in Cleveland), he has only been in Cleveland two years fresh off managing San Francisco to a Super Bowl, has a mother even questioning why he'd trade three #1 picks for a 'could be great' star collegiate, Heismen winning quarterback, and a radio station calling for his resignation. Yeah, a lot going on in this busy plot. Costner is like this anchor, doing so without overstepping dramatically. He is just Costner.Key casting includes Jennifer Garner as Ali, Tom Weaver, Junior's (Costner) love interest, Patrick Esprit (as GM of Seahawks) a fun rival of Weaver's, Chadwick Boseman as a potentially strong defensive player who is able to steer Weaver into looking harder at the presumed 'next sure thing' (Josh Pence), Ellen Burstyn as Weaver's mom, Sean Combs as Bo Callahan's agent, and a feisty, opinionated Dennis Leary as Weaver's head coach. Frank Langella, as owner Anthony Molina, really has this persistent need to run things without much approval from Weaver, which causes some serious friction between the two. The film hinges on the various dramatic dynamics on display between Costner and the cast of characters that make his life difficult.",6,0,0,21 June 2015
Law Abiding Citizen," Law Abiding Citizen
","To be honest, F Gary Gray's Law Abiding Citizen is ultimately, in my mind, a cat and mouse thriller putting the imperfect justice system on trial. We see stories all the time on NBC's Law and Order about how lawyers negotiate deals in order to get a somewhat respectable verdict based on the evidence presented and the strength of the cases involved.To me, the screenplay is purposely manipulative, specifically designed to prey on our emotions..how could we not sympathize with Gerard Butler after witnessing the opening minutes and the unfortunate result when the real killer is put on trial, getting off on a technicality? We see hot shot lawyer, career on the rise, Jamie Foxx orchestrate a deal with the repulsive rapist/killer of both Butler's wife and daughter. The wrong man is convicted(he was there in the house to rob and his partner, who couldn't help himself and control his deviant impulses, frames him for the crimes)and Butler even looks on as Foxx shakes the hand of the perpetrator who served a mere two years on a measly five year sentence. Smartly, Kurt Wimmer's script forwards the story ten years later showing us Foxx who has a ten year old daughter. This affords Butler plenty of time to have put together his masterplan. Butler, is far more than just some simple inventor, as Foxx and all included (who were participants, in one way or another, in the release of a despicable cretin after a lousy prison sentence) will soon come to realize.Bruce McGill is the DA and Leslie Bibb is a lawyer on Foxx's team, and they, among others, will have to somehow outsmart Butler who is, amazing enough, coordinating attacks on everyone who allowed injustice to be carried out..this as he is arrested and imprisoned. Butler wants to 'bring the whole temple down', proclaiming that the court system is corrupt and immoral as he plans to make a 'biblical' statement, to leave his mark on Foxx. The mystery is what Butler wants Foxx to figure out. It's all about how criminals are oftentimes treated too easily, while the just are dealt a terrible hand. The filmmakers are certainly puppeteers..they toy around with our emotions, having us choose sides. Foxx has a more difficult role than Butler..he must convince the audience that his lawyer is someone who doesn't deserve what is meted out to his friends, peers, and associates. You see, we can understand why Butler is in such a psychological state..motivated by the hell that has left him without a family and justice for their demise. Of course, it's up to Wimmer's screenplay to concoct a way for how Butler can achieve the various traps which kill many associated with Foxx..it's all rather preposterous, but making him some sort of cerebral gadget genius known for designing tools used to assassinate our government's 'bad guys', equipped with an ability to strategize plots that befuddle and confuse an entire city's law enforcement and legal authority, allows the movie to arrange ingenious scenarios to keep the viewer wondering what would happen next.I have to hand it to the filmmakers, they really weave together quite a tale, putting Foxx in a sticky situation, his lawyer questioned for letting his egotistical desire to keep his criminal record intact over the possibility of taking his client's advice and engaging the person on trial in a court battle. Butler not only is afforded a chance to win our hearts for what he has gone through, and given a character who is both wily and incredibly intelligent. It's the case of two pros on opposing sides, yielding eventually one victor..who can outwit the other? How Butler is able to coordinate his plan from a prison cell is just extraordinary. I imagine Butler's revenge on his family's killer will be met with applause.",9,1,4,13 May 2010
