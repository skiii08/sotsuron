Alien 3," Falls flat in every regard.
","A3 is an unprecedented accumulation of wrong decisions: Reverting back to a use-once concept, using anti-heroes in a context that requires emotional attachment (to make a trivial point that never needed to be made), underestimating the impact of the previous movie's characters (and wasting them carelessly).But maybe the biggest mistake of all was to press ahead with the production without having a clear-cut idea of where this story was heading. It is painful to see even seasoned actors like Sigourney Weaver struggling with the immaturity of the script - a battle beyond hope that ends with everyone capitulating to a hopelessly muddled plot-line, awfully witless dialog, terribly overblown pathos and totally uninspired gore scenes. Every dramatic moment is unintentionally funny, every attempt at sarcasm inappropriate, every attempt at suspense fails to hit the mark.A3 falls flat as a horror film, but even more so as a drama. It is easily debunked as the kind of pseudo-intellectual garbage that desperately tries to be more, and fails so horribly that it must be recommended to film students as a lesson in how *not* to make a film.",1,65,76,15 November 2008
