Source Code," The Source Code 10/10
","Simple breath taking i love the idea and the script what else to say excellent movie big surprise in 2011... Everyone should watch it and discuss about it cause its a great concept. And this movie went even beyond the sands of time...:) not referring to prince of persia but some time travel and actually living in another zone, when u are in the source code. I wonder if in future this thing can be possible!!! Great acting same cast in different situations replaying the moment again and again till Colter Stevens got it right at the end. He saves the train and his all the ppl and creates alternative future when from the past effecting on the future outcome how inspireing that was. Its not just science fictions it makes u wonder in normal life what path u used and where did u go wrong. Amazing movie worth of watching every second of it.",10,0,2,11 April 2011
