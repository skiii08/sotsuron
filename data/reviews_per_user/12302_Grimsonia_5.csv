Hereditary," Wanted to believe the hype
","It starts off well, but then turns into utter nonsensical, gore for stars garbage. How others have rated this highly I have no idea. This is crap.",1,1,4,29 October 2018
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," This was an awful ending to an amazing series
","Terminator, the original was a great movie. It was dark and atmospheric. The acting was excellent. I felt Michael Biehn(sp) and Linda Hamilton's characters had chemistry together, the story was good and the action was amazing.Terminator 2 however, blew me away! How the characters had grown! The future still dark... The action sequences were even better! I waited, and waited so hopefully for the sequel... then finally I saw it, and it had nothing in common with the first two serious films other than the vague following of the plot. The whole film was a joke, and if it had been marketed as a farce or comedy I may have liked it, but it was presented as a serious sequel somehow! The female terminator was hilarious, not menacing... the original terminator looked ready for a rest home, The guy who took over Furlongs part was also very amusing with the dumbo ears and white hair when they show him in the future and the girl was a waste of film altogether... she screamed well, I guess...I'd have to give her that...It was noted on Linda Hamilton's website that she refused a small part they offered her in the beginning because she said the film had no heart or soul or something like that, and she was right. The first two did and are classics, the third, well, it should never have been made, but the greed and the lack of talent are great in this world...",1,3,8,8 October 2007
The Cabin in the Woods," Great but not horror
","This movie was excellent, but it was not a horror movie. This was more black comedy horror and it owes it's success to the wit of the writers and also their familiarity with oh so many horror movies that have come before. The writers are certainly horror movie fans but this was more of a homage to those that have come before.It starts out with a bunch of beautiful young people that you assume will simply be killed one by one if you haven't read the reviews but the movie evolves into a much better film than that with a lot more creativity even though they nod to a huge number of old and newer classic straight horror films.The acting is excellent and the stoner guy basically steals the show. I want to comment on so much more but can't without giving the story away... Argh! I loved that they knew their classic films and that plus their cleverness makes this film one I want to own.",9,0,7,15 April 2012
Mad Max: Fury Road," Fury Road aka Thunderdome 2015
","I really wanted to like this movie. I read the glowing reviews and eagerly went to see the movie this afternoon. I sat in the theatre and kept waiting to be moved by the action or the plot and felt absolutely nothing but boredom and sadness.I am a fan of Mad Max and Road Warrior. Thunderdome was garbage and although this wasn't garbage it was far from good. I mean, did they really need a mutant midget?! Did they really need a blind mutant guitarist on the front of a truck?! In a post apocalyptic world are we really going to see that many women that look as if they've just stepped off a model's runway? Besides all the things that are just preposterous or don't make sense there is absolutely no character development and the characters do not make any sort of connections themselves. What we get is a lot of car chase with a lot of things blowing up around some very attractive visuals, but little plot or any real reason to care about the characters or the movie itself. I for one am really disappointed.",1,37,77,24 May 2015
Alien: Covenant," Awful and disappointing
","I was so looking forward to this after Prometheus and was appalled at how awful alien covenant turned out to be. The characters were soulless puppets that made the most illogical decisions. The star and only interesting character is David who we are told tortured and killed the hero of the last film, Shaw.All the questions about the mysterious race that may or may not have created humanity are shoved under the rug and superceeded by a bad film that tries to recapture the thrills of the first aliens but fails miserably.This film was also so boring that it put my boyfriend to sleep.",1,36,70,25 May 2017
