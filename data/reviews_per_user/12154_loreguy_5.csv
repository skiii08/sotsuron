The Blair Witch Project," Spooky, yes. But so is a future where these kids run things.
","Two things I learned having watched 'Blair Witch Project':1. You don't need a big budget to make a creepy, scary movie2. Unprepared, loser Gen X'rs are the new fodder for supernatural monsters
#1 is the only praise I have for the film, and #2 is why I wouldn't recommend it to anyone over 30.  Unless you can empathize with sullen, clueless 20-somethings, you won't find much to hang on to with 'Project' other than wanting it to be over.The idiots of the 50s and 60s horror films who 'looked behind the door' or were babes who stayed home alone, or went into the spooky, old house are now the unprepared, give-up-really-easily, loser Gen Xers who go into the spooky old house.I'm glad another indie film made a lot of money, but sorry I contributed to their success.",4,0,2,27 November 1999
The Bourne Identity," Great Movie
","After reading (and loving) this novel at least 4 times, I was SOOOO disappointed by the first movie version.  The newest version, while making some changes from the book, is a top-notch actualization of the book.  Matt Damon and Franka Potente are perfect, and so is Chris Cooper, one of the great supporting actors working.",8,0,1,6 July 2002
Rules of Engagement," Waste of Great Talent and a repeat of the Mistakes of GI Jane
","This movie starts off about one thing, and then is transformed (badly) into another.  Like GI Jane, the movie seems to be about choices and challenges for the hero, and how he/she deals with them.  But both movies then fabricate a scumwad-politician, Washington-is-evil plot out of nothing, and try to make the movie about that.  What a waste of fine talent and performances.  Could have been really good.",6,0,1,21 October 2000
The Dark Knight," Don't Believe the Hype
","I don't get the high ratings and glowing reviews this has received. Yes, Heath Ledger's performance is better-than-average. But this is a badly-flawed movie, largely because of its tedious conglomeration of plot points, all of which collide in mostly unsatisfactory ways. I was prepared to be blown away. Instead, I was squirming in my seat before the half-way point. And I have two questions: First, is Gary Oldman too big a star for someone to tell him to speak up and stop mumbling the ends of all of his lines? And second, how did Maggie Gyllenhaall get this job? She's a fine actress, but is woefully miscast here. OK, I lied, three: whose idea was it for Christian Bale to do the voice he uses when he's Batman? And how did the other actors keep from laughing whenever he spoke? I think that if Heath Ledger had not tragically and stupidly lost his life, this movie would have flopped like a live fish on the pavement. All that money and talent, and a script that should have been cut by about 30 minutes, after it had been rewritten for coherency. Thank goodness for Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman.",6,6,13,19 December 2008
A Beautiful Mind," Pretty Good
","A pretty good movie. Outstanding performances by everyone, but a kind of 'so what?' articulation of Nash's story. I think it would have had more impact if we had seen more of both his genius (not the BS with him doing nonsensical stuff, but actually doing math relating to his theory that won the Prize) and his illness. The movie at a minimum should have given more information about Nash's unique contribution to Mathematics. All told, it got about 2 minutes, as compared to the amount of time given his hallucinations.",6,0,1,14 July 2002
