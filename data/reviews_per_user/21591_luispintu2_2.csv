The Avengers," Best Super-Hero Movie EVER!!!
","I can only say this:If you simply know the characters... Or have a profound knowledge in comics... Or simply like the fantastic type... THIS IS THE MOVIE FOR YOU!!!I felt like a teenage watching this excellent movie. It has a lot of fun, action scenes, an excellent plot and all the characters have their minutes to shine. They are all as we know them from the comics and the movies.A must to all comics lovers!!!Going to see it for the second time today! Hope all enjoy it as i did, and believe me i'm on countdown for the second already :).",10,23,45,27 April 2012
Clash of the Titans," Could it be worst?
","Greetings, Has the title of my review i ask again:Could it be worst? The answer is; maybe! Very poor movie. The 3D is very low and the best of it where the subtitles because the movie it self isn't.The story is very thin, in 15 minutes of the movie was done, the way the characters are added to the group it seemed more like they where filling sausages.The best of it is Hades the effects are well balanced the character is very well represented by Ralph Fiennes with a very poor Perseus such as Zeus.Save the money for other 3D movie. This is a movie to see at home and rent the DVD.Regards,",2,2,4,21 April 2010
