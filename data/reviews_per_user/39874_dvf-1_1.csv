Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Kill Bill? Kill me!
","I know that almost all of the people who will read these reviews are in LOVE with Tarantino, and don't get me wrong I really love his movies; Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs, both films were written and directed very well. However, Kill Bill 2 sucks! So what if this is his fifth film, his tenth film, or his first film, I mean really do we really care? There are plenty of directors and writers out there that have made better films and more of them. As a film student I view films all the time and I could have made this film, bottom line, not that I would have wanted too. But if I had the money and I could have used the same actors etc; I could have easily made this boring, long, totally pointless film. Let's be honest both Kill 1 and Kill 2 look like a college students final project before he goes out into the film making world. Quentin needs to grow up and try making a film that is good and that will make some money. Bottom line here is watch it at a friends house because it's not even worth renting.",2,4,9,19 April 2004
