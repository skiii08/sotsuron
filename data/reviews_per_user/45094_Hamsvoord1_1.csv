Come and See," The best anti war(hate) movie
","This is the only war movie which make'd me cry, there more though war movie's but this one is the hardest! Should you have some romantic view of war, this movie will end it. This movie tells the story of a boy which joins the russian partizans, it is one of the few war movie's that doesnt have glamour, there no winners in this war. The movie shows the life of Aleksei (Florya Gaishun)during the rage of the nazi's in Russia. He joins the Russian partizans against the will of his mother, from here he loses grip on things and the war is taking over his entire look on things. It is quiet clear to me that his actions where motivated by romantic views on life(and war)but the steps he took into action had shown him another thing about war and hate. This movie is the best war movie i ever seen and i saw quite a lot of them, it will change your view on war(every war). I rate this movie with ***** out of *****, the best war movie i ever seen!",7,5,7,25 February 2003
