Kill Bill: Vol. 2," A streamlined follow-up to the first exotic volume
","*may have spoilers!!!*Kill Bill 2 is certainly only for Kill Bill Fans. Those interested in diagnosing realism in film should steer clear, and those interested in having a good time with unusual film situations, abnormal dialogue, and pretty camera shots will have a great time.This movie is not as gory as the first, and somehow seems sillier in it's own strange way. Anyone just out for gore should avoid this one. Sorry to you bored, bloodthirsty multitudes!  you have to listen to people speaking! Gasp! (don't get me wrong, i love gore, but i also love a good plot). Anyone who says this movie has no plot is dead wrong. It has one of the most complicated plots you'll ever see in an action film. Also what i love is there is less of a line in this movie between the good and the bad. It's always a nice twist to have a confused heroine; torn between revenge and love and family; right and wrong.This is an excellent, quick-paced, and fun movie. A MUST-SEE if you saw Kill Bill vol. 1",8,1,2,9 May 2004
2001: A Space Odyssey," Not for the average movie-goer
","quite simply, This is a strange and beautiful film; a classic work of art filled with beauty and unsettling questions. Many average moviegoers will be confused by the shift of characters and setting and be annoyed by the strange, slow pacing and lack of simple questions and answers. I suggest this film gem to those who want to enjoy a great soundtrack and unique visuals. that's all there is to it. It will make you think.",8,1,3,9 May 2004
