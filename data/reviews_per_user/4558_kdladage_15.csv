Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Where it all began?
","STAR WARS: THE PHANTOM MENACE is an interesting place to start the STAR WARS saga. Although it has taken me a while, I have grown to really like watching this film. It is, in my humble opinion, every bit as good as the original STAR WARS (A NEW HOPE).The dialog is comparable (meaning that it is god-awful); the acting is about the same (sub-par in most respects) but has some notable exceptions (such as Liam Neeson's performance, which I consider to be as good as Sir Alec Guinness' performance in STAR WARS).My one complaint in the film? Jake Lloyd.'What?' you ask... 'Not Jar Jar Binks?' No. I have no trouble with Jar Jar Binks what-so-ever. Although, admittedly, I had some trouble with the character after my initial viewing of the film, I have come to realize that Jar Jar is no more annoying than C3P0... in other words, this is a movie designed to be entertaining to kids at the ages of 10-14; and as an adult, I need to re-capture that 10-14 year old kid inside me in order to fully appreciate it. Jar Jar is fun when you look at him in that light.But Jake Lloyd... it is not his fault really, it is just that George decided to make Anakin too young in this film. Had Anakin been a 14-year old instead, much of the things that he does would have made a lot more sense. Watch the film -- imagine Anakin as a 14-year old and I think you will see what I mean.And back to my initial comment: once you start putting together the plot that extends from this film to Episode III, you see why this film begins when it does. But let's face it -- the sage of Star Wars actually begins much, much earlier. It would be very interesting to go back a thousand years and tell those tales...",6,0,1,22 June 2005
Meet the Parents," Who watches this crap?
","This is one of the most unfunny comedies I have ever seen. Each scene in the film appears tailor made to dig the main character (played by Ben Stiller) into a deeper and deeper hole that anyone with two functioning brain cells can see coming a mile away.Ben Stiller can act. I have seen it. I have seen him handle very funny roles, and even dramatic ones with skill and flair. He appears to be asleep through most of this film, just saying his lines when it is time to say them, without real emotion or concern for how bad this film really is.Robert DeNiro can act. Most people have seen that. He is one of the greatest actors ever. But his most recent roles have been... well... less than wonderful. He needs a new agent -- today -- before his legacy is destroyed.The film has a decent premise -- we have all had that awkward moment when we need to meet the parents of our significant other. And this film had some real potential to shine. But the writing is so formula-based and lack-luster that one has to wonder if any of the main cast members bothered to read the script before they accepted these roles.Just skip this.",2,2,4,7 June 2005
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," The conclusion?
","STAR WARS: RETURN OF THE JEDI is the final chapter in a six-movie series that, although filmed and produced out of order, serves as a cap-stone on the whole thing.But does it? Rumors from many years ago suggest that at least 3 more films, and perhaps even six more films were planned at the start -- and with George Lucas' current age, we can pretty much assure ourselves that we will not see them. At least not as he would have produced them. George is, after all, George -- and George does not like other people messing with his universe.If I have a complaint about RETURN OF THE JEDI it is with Ewoks. I will not get into the things that bug me about those darned little teddy-bears, because most people that watch the film will see the problems for themselves. One can complain, I suppose, but STAR WARS is George Lucas' playground, and that is what he wanted to use. His call.Does this film do an effective job of ending the saga? For the most part, yes. There is a bit of a feeling of 'well, now what?' that you get as the final scenes are putting themselves up on screen; and for those that have read the Extended Universe novels, there are some pretty darned good ideas for what could (should?) happen next. Would I like to see more Star Wars films? Most definitely. These are some of my favorite 'guilty-pleasure' films of all time. But I would not hold my breath waiting for them.",7,3,7,22 June 2005
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The Bridge begins...
","STAR WARS: ATTACK OF THE CLONES is a wonderful romp through the STAR WARS universe. Some of the best overall action scenes in the series take place right here. But the film feels like it was cut in half... because it was. This is not a movie in and of itself: it is the first half of a movie that is *not* completed in the next STAR WARS movie (REVENGE OF THE SITH) -- it is completed in the absolutely fantastic Cartoon Network Clone Wars shorts (both the First and Second series).If you watch the movie, then watch the two cartoon series and think of this as one, very long (approximately 5-hour) epic film, then this probably deserves a rating of 8 (maybe 8.5 overall). But as a stand-alone film, it is just slightly lower -- I gave it a 7.ATTACK OF THE CLONES continues the saga started in Episode I; and begins the real bridge that needs to form from the prequels (I, II, and III) to the original trilogy (IV, V, and VI). In that role, it serves admirably.All of the same problems that exist in the other Star Wars films exist here -- but this is the first time Ewan McGregor really shows that he can play the part of Obi-Wan Kenobi. His performance is outstanding; as is the sheer presence of Samuel L. Jackson.The story line is a bit more evident in this film than it was in THE PHANTOM MENACE. And by the time you see REVENGE OF THE SITH -- if you really examine it, the story line in Episode I becomes more clear. Overall, this is an excellent stepping stone for the STAR WARS saga.",7,1,2,22 June 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Tolkien would be proud...
","It has been tossed around in Hollywood for a long time. The very idea of making a big-budget feature film of the timeless novels is intoxicating. But how do you create a film that is true to the stories (and thus not going to upset the legions of rabid fans that can practically quote the books from start to finish) and still make a film that will attract the non-rabid fan who has vaguely heard of the existence of these books by some author from World War I? Well, I do not claim to be a rabid fan (I read the books, I liked the books, and have felt for a long time that they could make a good movie). I also do not claim to be some sort of insider that can give someone the secret tot he process that lead to this masterpiece. But i can say that not since _The Godfather_ have I been this impressed with the overall production values of a movie. The cast, crew, writers, producers, and very talented director managed to tell a very good version of the first book's tale......and as an adaptation, I give the movie a '9/10' (perhaps even as high as '9.5/10') -- but as a stand-alone film, it has to drop to '8/10' because the film leaves you hanging (much as the books did) at the end with no resolution to *anything* what-so-ever.Additionally, there is no telling at all the story of 'why' the various people met in the Elfin lands to discuss this powerful ring; and the tale of Boromir (an important one, indeed) is not explained so that his betrayal and fate can be understood. It is one of those points that, without it, cause one to not really understand the actions this poor man takes in the film.Still, despite these shortcomings, the film is a fantastic piece of work that I highly recommend to anyone and everyone. But: I recommend that you watch the extended cut DVD version, and that you plan to sit down for all three films -- because this is not (technically) a stand-alone film. It is just Act 1 of a 3 Act screenplay.",8,3,5,30 June 2005
The Matrix Revolutions," Nothing Revolutionary in Revolutions
","For those of us that went to see THE MATRIX in the theater, what we saw was a thinking-man's action-adventure film. The special effects were there to propel the plot and to emphasize the film's underlying questions on the nature of reality, the nature of humanity and the power of the mind over the body. The film was a self-contained story -- beginning, middle and end -- and it told its tale very well, with style grace and power.The potential in a trilogy based upon this stellar beginning was great. Sort of like those of us that watched STAR WARS about the 10th time and suddenly there was the words 'Episode IV' at the beginning subtly telling us that there was a lot more of this great film to come.For those of us that went to see THE MATRIX: RELOADED in the theater, we saw a film that displayed for us what it would have been like if the first half of THE MATRIX had been expanded to a full-length film. This was alright, however, because we got to have our interlude -- the search for the 'McGuffin' of the Key-Maker lead us to the Architect and gave us a list of questions dealing with the nature of the matrix that would keep us talking for months until the next film came out. it was not as good as number one, but it served its purpose. After all, the big payoff was coming in the third installment, right?For those of us that went to see THE MATRIX: REVOLUTIONS in the theater, we saw a film that reminded us that, in the end, what it all boils down to is this: THE MATRIX is just another series of action-adventure flicks, nothing more. In the end, it leaves us feeling as emotionally detached as a DIRTY HARRY movie.And this is sad, because the first one gave us so much hope that this trilogy could be so much more than it turned out to be. It asked dozens of deep, philosophical questions and in the third movie, ignored them, talked around them, and managed to answer none of them. The war is over. But is it? After all, the human population will grow in Zion and with the machines still up there, they are bound to but heads again... Neo is dead. But is he? After all, he dies in the first episode too, and he was still around for two sequels. Agent Smith was destroyed. But was he? After all, he, too, was destroyed in the first film, and he, too, returned for two sequels.All of this leads me to believe that we were given some smoke and mirrors in the first episode. It was great smoke and mirrors, to be sure. But in the end, it was every bit as phony as the world within the Matrix, and had about as much substance.",5,0,0,7 November 2003
Batman Begins," A nearly perfect start to a new BATMAN franchise
","After a series of severe letdowns in films like BATMAN AND ROBIN, I was somewhat jaded... I was not really looking forward to seeing this new installment of BATMAN. Then, three things happened: I caught wind of the fact that Christopher Nolan (of such films as MOMENTO and INSOMNIA) would be directing; I heard that Morgan Freeman (the most under-appreciated man in Hollywood, if you ask me) would be in the film; and then I read that this would, in no way what-so-ever be related to the disappointing films of the past.Add these three things together and what you get is: possibilities.So... Mr. Nolan decides to back up and start from the beginning. And rather than just waving a hand to the fact that BATMAN, a non-powered super-hero, is one of the toughest S.O.B.s to walk a beat in comicbookville, he gives a glimpse of not only the 'why' of the Bat's existence, but the 'how' as well. And for the first time, it all makes sense.BATMAN, you see, is not 'just' Bruce Wayne in this film. It is a symbol; a torch-bearer of possible redemption for Gotham City and it just so happens that Bruce Wayne is carrying the torch right now. Because, as you see in this film, BATMAN is really a combination of the efforts and good-will of Bruce Wayne, Alfred (his butler and closest friend), Luscious Fox (Director of Wayne Enterprises R&D department), and (to a somewhat lesser extent) Police Sergeant (and later Lieutenant) Gordon -- who we all know will eventually be Police Commissioner Gordon one day.These are the people that BATMAN trusts. These are the people that either know who he is, or have some idea of what he is about. And as we see the BATMAN persona develop in this film, there are very few times when your suspension of disbelief is being tested.BATMAN is a dark, dark film. But it should be. BATMAN is no boyscout. He is the Dark Knight who operates by striking fear into the hearts of those that would prey upon, and bring fear to, the innocents of his city. And make no mistake, Bruce Wayne/BATMAN thinks of Gotham as 'his' city. And he will protect it (to borrow a phrase) 'by any means necessary.' In the end, when you watch this movie, the only flaw it has is this: despite being nearly 2.5 hours long, it ends too quickly. You find yourself being catapulted through the mid-to-late parts of the film. In all honesty, I would have liked to have seen this movie told over 3 to 3.5 hours. To paraphrase James Cameron: 'If the film needs to be 3 hours long, then let it be 3 hours long. Do not compromise the story in order to meet an artificial time limit.' Overall, I am very happy with this movie. I eagerly await the next installment.",8,3,5,27 June 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," One of the Best Films ever Made

I also do not claim to be some sort of insider that can give someone the secret to the process that lead to this masterpiece.

Had the story of Boromir been actually told in the Fellowship, then this butchering of the Faramir tale would not have been needed. Still, it manages to recover in the end from this failing and tell what is an engaging (if not a bit confusing) story of the path that the ring takes...Despite this one small shortcoming, the film is a fantastic piece of work that I highly recommend to anyone and everyone. But: I recommend that you watch the extended cut DVD version, and that you plan to sit down for all three films -- because this is not (technically) a stand-alone film.

The Matrix Reloaded," An admirable follow-up to a blockbuster beginning...
","In my review of the third installment of this film trilogy, I wrote:-----=====-----For those of us that went to see THE MATRIX: RELOADED in the theater, we saw a film that displayed for us what it would have been like if the first half of THE MATRIX had been expanded to a full-length film.

This was a good film with so much potential that it was practically dripping off the screen like the green matrix code the characters are always watching. The ideas and concepts in the film are solid, and the build up is very cool. Some of the special effects are not as effective here (mainly because we have seen it all before). But the story reaches its peak in the last few minutes of the film -- as a good cliff-hanger should.The problems with this film are reflective of the fact that it is not a complete story -- it it a first half, and so has to be taken with consideration for how it propels us into the third installment. The first film does not suffer from this problem because it is a self-contained whole that can stand alone if need be (and in my opinion, that is exactly how you should look at that film).The context of this union is very important. And unfortunately, the third installment does not live up to the hype built up by this second installment. So, we are left with questions asked in this film that never get answered in the third film... and thus, it is unsatisfying.I would recommend skipping this one and its follow-up entirely, and just enjoying the first one as a stand-alone movie.",7,1,2,15 June 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," ...and the Bridge is complete...
","STAR WARS: REVENGE OF THE SITH is, perhaps, the best film in the STAR WARS saga (the only possible exception is Episode V). This film does what I thought was impossible -- it ties up every lose end that was introduced in Episodes I, and II (as well as a few that took place in the outstanding Cartoon Network CLONE WARS tales) and ties them in well with where everything was starting in Episode IV... and it does it in a very entertaining way! I mean, let's face it: WELCOME TO THE DARK SIDE! The acting in this film is the best of any STAR WARS film. The dialog is about on par with other STAR WARS films, but the delivery of that dialog is second to none. The Emperor feels terrifying and powerful, even as he sits in a chair in his office; the Jedi feel confident and unaware of the plots that are unfolding around them. The pain and betrayal in the characters comes through the film very well. The emotions are running high (something George Lucas is notoriously bad at) and it is very well handled.In other words: THIS IS THE STAR WARS FILM YOU HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR.But one thing, really, keeps this from being a 9. This film is freaking dark. As I have said in other STAR WARS reviews, STAR WARS is a series designed to be enjoyed by kids ages 10-14. When this film received a PG-13 rating, I know things were not going to be like your typical STAR WARS film. And I was right.This film includes such dark images as dead youngling Jedi (kids younger than those the film was designed to entertain); and Anakin Skywalker, legless and helpless, burning up in a pool of lava... very, very dark images. Be aware of this before you show this film to younger children.",8,2,4,22 June 2005

Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Arguably the most important film in Sci-Fi history...
","STAR WARS is, without a doubt, one of the most *influincial* films of its time (and perhaps even _ever_). When it was released, people began standing in line for hours in order to watch this movie for the fifteenth time -- something that had never happened before. STAR WARS changed the way we think about movies; it changed the way we market movies; it changed the way we think about sci-fi and fantasy in film; it killed the second STAR TREK series in pre-production at the time; it was important.Let me say that again: STAR WARS was important. That fact cannot be stressed enough. STAR WARS launched George Lucas into history, and created an industry legacy: ILM, THX, and so on. Suddenly, the idea that special effects needed to be of superior quality, and that the technology of movie making was something that needed to move forward became evident.STAR WARS was a 'great' film in the sense that it was so important. But as a film, taken away from its context historically, it is not such a 'great' film. The acting in many cases is sub-par; the dialog is painful to listen to at times; and Luke Skywalker has got to be the whiniest kid that ever lived (asside from, perhaps, his father, as it turns out).Still, STAR WARS stands alone as a fun, entertaining ride through the stars with an adventure that some fans, these days, can practically quote line-for-line.George Lucas has made some slight modifications to the film over the years -- the most note-worthy being the Han Solo-Greedo match-up. Although I am not really happy with that particular change, these are George's films and he can do what he wants with them. This makes George Lucas and his films unique in the industry: George really does not care if his films are popular, or if anyone likes them at all. Geroge makes movies for George to enjoy. We are all just along for the ride.",6,4,9,22 June 2005
300," Amazing action/adventure tale!
","Thre is a point early in the film when a Persian messenger comes to demand the Spartan King's surrender and Queen Gorgo offers her opinion on the situation. The messenger does his best to ignore her, and instead looks at the Spartan King and asks 'Why does this woman think she can speak amongst men?' Queen Gorgo, before her beloved husband can answer, says 'Because only Spartan women give birth to real men.' At this point, you realize that this film has some good dialog, and some very capable acting taking place. Granted, this is not the Battle of Thermopylae as it happened; this is not the Battle of Thermopylae as it was told by Dilios, the Spartan orator that told the tale after the fact to inspire his countrymen into action; this is not even the Battle of Thermopylae as Hollywood would derive it from Dilios' work.This is an adaptation of a Frank Miller graphic novel, which was an adaptation of the earlier Hollywood effort (The 300 Spartans), which was an adaptation of Dilios. This means, if you are familiar with Frank Miller (the Dark Knight series, for example), that you know that you are in for a hell of a ride. The visuals are done to be int eh same style as Frank Miller's artwork. The story is an ancient one, but with a distinct, unique, and very cutting-edge style. the writing is excellent (and by that, I mean that the dialog feels natural and smooth; the actions taken by the characters do not jar against the circumstances; nothing appears out of place). It really is about as good as action/adventure has ever been.Is the film perfect? No. It has its flaws, but they are small, easily ignorable (or even missed!) If you go to this and do not enjoy yourself -- then I am not sure what sort of action/adventure film could appeal to you.",9,1,5,31 March 2007
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," An epic continuation of the Star Wars saga
","The first time I watched STAR WARS, the immortal words 'Episode IV: A New Hope' were not there on the screen. I cannot recall when it was that I first saw those words and realized that STAR WARS was but one chapter of a much larger whole.When STAR WARS: THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK came out, my father and I went to the theater and watched in awe as that next chapter unfolded. The plot twists were shocking at times (although in today's world, rather cliché -- but they were not cliché _then_) and at other times, goofy.The dialog was just as I remembered STAR WARS -- stilted, canned, and corny (witness the dialog between Han Solo and the Princess if you want to know what I mean). But let's face it -- you do not watch STAR WARS because of the dialog. You watch it in the same vein as reading old epic tales of Greek Gods and Heros -- for the things they are doing, not the things they are saying.Overall, this is either the best, or second best of the six STAR WARS films. Well worth watching.",8,1,2,22 June 2005
