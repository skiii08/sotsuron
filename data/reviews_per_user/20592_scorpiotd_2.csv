It," Very Memorable Film. 'You'll float, too.'
","I was actually expecting this movie to be bad, but it exceeded my expectations and gave us a very terrifying story of a creature that appears every 27 years in the form of a clown to feed off the fears of children. It was well done, and Alexander Skarsgard gave an amazing performance as Pennywise, and in my opinion, he was better than Tim Curry. In the original miniseries, during Georgie's death scene, it is only implied that Pennywise ate him but showing a still frame of Tom Curry revealing his sharp teeth, but in this version, we're given a much more dark approach as Pennywise is shown biting off Georgie's arm, who then crawls out into the street, crying out to his brother, before being dragged into the sewer. Chilling. The film had its suspenseful moments, like when one of the bullies wanders into a cave with a blowtorch and is chased by zombies. Another moment comes up where a Losers Club member is locked in a room with a bunch of clowns. Which would could be Pennywise??? was the thought that ran through everyone's head in the theater. Even though moments like these existed, the film relied on mostly jump scares which isn't really true terror.Other than that, I thought 'It' had great acting and great Cinematography/camera movements. The story was enjoyable and definitely an improvement on the original, but the romance felt off. Billy and Ben both have the hots for Beverly, but Ben was the first to meet her and he wrote her a poem, eventually kissing her to break a spell. All Billy did was stare at her the whole movie and it ended with them making out. This romance between Beverly and Billy could been done so much better. Anyway, I really liked It. I thought it was good. I look forward to seeing its sequel in chapter two.",8,3,5,25 September 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," This was an awesome movie
","This movie is great. I love the action especially when Iron Man fought Hulk. But seriously, Black Widow and Hulk have nothing in common other than the fact that they work well together. Also, Thor is a jerk.Stan Lee's cameo was funny but it also didn't make sense. He said 'Excelsior' just for drinking too much alcohol. Vision seemed like a show-off when he picked up Thor's hammer for no reason. And for Captain America, in the movie, when the options are fight or flight, he picks flight. He was way cooler in The Winter Soldier.I like that we got to see more of Hawkeye's character in this film. And Black Widow. so yeah great movie",7,2,6,12 May 2015
