The Devil's Advocate," A Movie About Human, Satan, Sin, Free Will, and Desire
","As you can see on my short review title above, this movie might make us contemplate about bad things we have done to people or society which are actually agonizing our-own-self. Or, have you ever asking to yourself why does Satan always make us do wrong things ? have you ever blame Satan ? Well... The Satan will answer those questions in the movie.Regardless of the movie's premise, we all actually know that Al Pacino is a great actor and he didn't disappoint me. One of his best performances was his monologue about the idea about himself (as Satan) and The God, it was so iconic !Charlize Theron was great too. She transformed herself from a happy-stable-life wife who loved her husband to a clueless rich wife, losing her husband attention, getting crazier and crazier overtime as she saw demonic vision of the people around her, which was ironic because she was the first one who realize that satan's is actually around her.And Keanu Reeves, good. The first time I know him was from The Matrix and John Wick. The characters he played were quite similar IMO so there is nothing special. But I saw a different character from him in this movie, although the differences weren't (again) that special. But overall he acted well.Unfortunately, the movie has some flaws and a little bit confusing (if you are a hard-thinker and a plot-hunter) but if you focus on the premise and curious about what will happen as the movie goes by (of course you should because this is a mystery movie), this won't be a problem.",7,3,4,27 February 2019
Captain Marvel," Lower your expectations. Do not compare this to The Avengers. And Voila !! Enjoy !!
","Even before the trailer was released I always set my mind that any superhero movie will be just a superhero movie as it always be (except Nolan's Batman) :1. Typical, some of them are Cliche
2. Fun
3. A Few Sentimental NotionSo I lowered my expectation, and Voila !! I found it quite enjoyable ! I don't understand why some people feel the movie was bad or a disappointment. I even think this is better than Spider-man Homecoming and both Ant-Man movies. Hmm... Maybe that's because they compare this to The Avengers ? Or even The Infinity War ? I think that is a huge mistake ! If you want to enjoy this, just do not compare this to The Avengers, just don't !I will simplify what my judgement about the movie :(+) Goose The Cat was cute, steal the show at some scene
(+) Unusual (good) sentimental notion or background story(-) Minor plot holes to the MCU
(-) A few jokes were lame
(-) A few failed acting (weird) and I think this is the directors' fault (I wish Marvel picks a more experienced director for the next Capt Marvel movie)
(-) The story was good, but could have been better. It was just not well toldOverall it was quite worth it, I didn't feel like I wasted my time. So my suggestion is : Go on ! Watch it :)",7,8,28,7 March 2019
Us," Not A Moviegoers-Friendly, Plot Holes Everywhere, and Not Funny (Of Course ! This is not a Comedy Movie)
","This is a movie for those whose background knowledge is as same as the director. This is a movie about symbolism, metaphor, and allusion, that not everyone would understand. This movie is enjoyable for only some people, not a movie for everyone. This is not a moviegoers-friendly I think. For those who understand this movie, be thankful, be grateful, because maybe you have watched a great movie, which I believe is not. Because I believe that a good movie is a movie enjoyable by everyone, even if it is tricky, requires you to think, but still understandable, that's what I call a good movie. And this is not one.Moreover, even after I did a research and read a bunch of review explaining about this movie's greatness, I still think this movie is not that great tho. There are way too many plot holes !! Maybe the director was focused more on creating symbolism, metaphor, and allusion rather than the coherence of the story. Maybe if the story doesn't have too many plot holes, at least I could enjoy the story, at least, but the reality is : I can't.In addition, there are a lot of weird questions coming out of my mind while I was watching this movie. Is this supposed to be funny ? Should I laugh for that joke ? Isn't it a horror-mystery-thriller movie ? or a comedy horror movie ? Because it was not funny and not thrilling.The only thing that I can appreciate is the notion/idea of the symbolism, metaphor, and allusion. I understand that some directors want to send a message in their movie. Unfortunately, the messages in this movie, which I think quite ambitious, are not balanced with the delivery of the messages.
P.S. I think this movie has a similarity with 'Coherence (2013/2014)'. A movie about doppelgangers too. But Coherence is better and more enjoyable compared to Us. I recommend you to watch it.",2,19,25,1 April 2019
Avengers: Endgame," All-Round Roller-Coaster Emotion, EPIC, Not A Perfect Movie, but A Perfect Ending to Infinity Saga
","I am trying to be honest and being objective as much as I can : this movie is EPIC, I am sure ever single person in the world who has watched it will be pleased and satisfied. It was a complete emotion-packed movie.It has a few flaws, I am sure some Marvel fans feel it too, some may be annoyed by the flaws (the directors should have done this, done that, why not this, why not that, minor plot holes, etc) but all was paid off by its EPIC-ness.PS : I felt empty after I watched the Endgame, even until I write this review. It is not because I don't like the movie, it is just because I am not sure whether the next MCU saga will be as GREAT and EPIC as this. Good luck for the future MCU !!",8,3,5,25 April 2019
Get Out," Brilliant ! One of the best unforgettable movies I have ever seen. A must-watch !
","Thrilling, smart, tricky, unique, and brilliant ! One of the best unforgettable movies I have ever seen. A must-watch !The premise, the plot, the acting, the scoring, the pace, everything is damn near perfect. I am definitely going to recommend this to everyone since it is enjoyable and watchable for moviegoers.Another brilliant touch that I like is how the social issue is brought up and mixed well in this movie. It delivers sadness and yet agreement and satisfaction for me. Brilliant, just brilliant !I watched 'Us' earlier and I feel a little bit dissapointed. But 'Get Out' is pure class ! I hope the Jordan Peele's next movie will be as enjoyable and brilliant as this.",10,5,14,8 June 2019
The Great Escape," A Funny and Entertaining Way to Learn a Little Part of History
","This movie is based on true story and I learned a lot from it : the camp environment, the characters, the German Luftwaffe, the plan and the effort of escaping, I love and enjoyed them all.One thing that made the movie special is : even if it is a historic movie, I was entertained for 2 hours and had fun watching it, 'hahaha' a lot ! The comedy and thrilling ambiance are mixed smartly. The characters development are perfectly balanced considering there are a lot of key characters in it. I also enjoyed the scoring, it suits the comedic ambiance well.Overall, I got not only entertainment but also history at the same time. Definitely worth to watch !",9,2,2,5 August 2019
