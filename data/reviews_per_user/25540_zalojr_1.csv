Miracle," Good Movie, but why ruin the Miracle?
","This was a great movie to watch. There was a good mix between Hockey and story so that it carries itself across evenly and smoothly. The down side is that as a Hockey coach I believe Disney allowed the Director to Disgrace the 1980 US Olimpic Team by taking away there true hard work. This movie makes the Soviets seem 'cheap' on the ice, and that I can tell you they were not. Anyone who knows hockey, knows that the Soviets could score at will, and they did not need to Run goaltender Jim Craig (which is what was shown in the movie) to score their third goal. Anyone who saw the real game knows that the soviets scored thier third and final goal on a defensive breakdown allowing the soviets to go in alone on a breakawy. I write this in the defense of hockey, do not take away from a historic event just to boost a dislike to a country that no longer exists. The US beat the soviets because of hard work, commitment, and teamship. Above all the soviets lost because of those same reasons.",Null,0,0,7 February 2004
