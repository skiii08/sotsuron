Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Damn the critics!!!
","Well anyone that sees the movie will clearly understand that anyone having negative comments about this movie clearly just want to see Lucas stumble. Once you see it, even if you have never seen any other Star Wars movie, you see what true film making really is. It was really very good, fantastic I would say. Pay no attention to what these so called 'professional' critics may say. If you see the movie, it will speak for itself. And it speaks VOLUMES!",10,0,0,20 May 1999
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," A heart-warming film
","This movie has all the elements of a great motion picture. One of the best written stories ever. Of all the times I have seen this movie in a theater, I've never been able to watch the scene where E.T. and Elliot are saying good-bye without tearing up.",10,1,2,24 March 2002
