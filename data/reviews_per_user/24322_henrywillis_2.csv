First Man," Chazele does justice to the legend of Neil Armstrong
","Damien Chazele's follow up to his big film La La Land is a biography on one of the bona fide heroes of American culture-scape Neil Armstrong. Collaborating once again with Chazele is Ryan Gosling who plays the main lead. The film is good although expecting a straight forward larger than life biopic the kind Hollywood is known for is not what this film is. This is a personal take on the nature and character of a public figure who hated the attention and adulation. The scenes with Armstrong's family gives us an inside look at the legendary man's state of mind both before and after launching. Of course, the actual mission is given weight and some scenes are bound to bring goosebumps to space aficionados. I was impressed with this film even though there aren't many uplifting, resounding scenes and the pacing is more of a gentle flow than a typical three act script structure.",Null,1,1,13 August 2019
Million Dollar Baby," Hard hitting, emotionally wrenching
","I really like this Clint Eastwood film. Besides directing, producing, and performing in 'Million Dollar Baby,' Eastwood also did the music which was simply well-integrated and perfectly composed to match and quietly enhance the plot progression, the mood, and the reaction of the characters. This is a gutsy film, gritty in emotions. It can be a tear-jerker yet not at all sentimental. It tells it like it is - the down to earth hard living of boxing (the theme being a 'crutch'), while the crux of the story concentrates on three main characters (each with haunting past): Eastwood as Frank the weathered boxing trainer, Hilary Swank as Maggie the enthusiastic spark in this whirl of boxing energy, and Morgan Freeman as 'Scrap' - besides being the voice-over narrator, provided the bridging catalyst as the cool and caring mainstay to both Frank and Maggie. There are sprinkles of wit and humor here and there - that's how life is: making up of laughter and smiles occasionally in the midst of challenges and struggles, joys and disappointments, hesitation and reinforcement of faith, plucking up courage to take that risk, and mishaps nevertheless happen. There is 'whose life is it anyway' dilemma - the confrontation of death, to be or not to be.",Null,1,2,26 December 2018
