Blade Runner 2049," Another beautiful but empty movie
","This film is like a girl I once dated - a 10 visually, but a 1 for content and meaning. If only I could have understood the plot and the background. If only I could have understood what the actors were saying half the time. It's sad when so much effort (and money) has obviously been expended to create such a beautiful dystopian world. This film was far less comprehensible than the original Blade Runner, and that movie was problematic at best. The whole premise of androids indistinguishable from humans is a bad joke. Humans at their most brilliant will never, ever be able to create something as complex as a real human being. The premise goes downhill from there. One of the central questions in this movie was 'Who's a real human and who's an android?' You've got to be kidding me. No android will ever come close to humanity. The human creation will NEVER come close to the work of the Creator. Don't waste your time on this mess.",2,3,6,15 October 2017
The Equalizer," Grisly patchwork of tired themes
","This film is not for the faint of heart, due to an unbelievable amount of ultra-violence. For example, Kubrick's 'Clockwork Orange' seems like a Disney movie by comparison. Sometimes creativity can be a bad thing, when it documents, in graphic detail, all sorts of choking, pummeling, corkscrew-throat-impaling, shooting, nail-gun killing and the like. Underlying all this creative carnage and dismemberment are many of the tired old themes we have seen before, such as the 'peaceful' and contemplative man whipped up into an orgy of blood-letting (Denzel Washington's character), the hooker with a heart of gold (Chloe Grace Moretz's character) and the psychotic Russian mobster (Marton Csokas's character). This is not, I repeat NOT, a good date movie. Consider yourself warned.",3,6,11,8 November 2014
The Big Lebowski," Does not age well AT ALL!
","I saw this movie when it first came out and thought it was hip, funny, original, quirky and cool, as did so many of the gushing reviewers who have commented already. The problem for me is that this movie is NOT classic material, because it does not age well. In fact, I could not watch more than ten minutes of it on the second attempted viewing. Perhaps the problem was the fact that I lost count of the number of F-bombs in the first few minutes. When the opening dialog would be incomprehensible if all the obscenities were bleeped, you know you have a problem. When the slutty wife of the rich Lebowski (as opposed to Jeff Bridges' character) offers a 'bl*w job' for $1000, it's no longer funny to me - it just makes me squirm. Perhaps I am just becoming stuffy as I grow older, but I don't think so. I think I have a better appreciation of quality, and this movie ain't it.",1,20,51,11 October 2014
Interstellar," '2001: A Space Odyssey' meets 'The Waltons.' UGH!
","The hype was monumental, so I just had to go see it. Oh the humanity! Oh the Humanism! Oh the special effects! My boy and I left the theater blinking and scratching our heads over the loose ends and the heavy slathering of deep inner meaning which, unfortunately, proved largely incomprehensible for our plebeian minds. Oh well. The similarities to Stanley Kubrick's '2001' were embarrassing at some points, although I assume most current movie goers have not seen this 46-year-old film. Throughout Interstellar, there was a lot of weepy overacting in various attempts to dramatize the effects of relativity on time and the resulting differences in human aging. Then there was the subtle, underlying message that humans are the gods who will rescue humanity. I prefer the capital-g God as my rescuer, thank you. This film was a special-effects extravaganza, but, ultimately, pretty lame.",2,14,29,8 November 2014
How to Train Your Dragon 2," Must-see and must-buy. You will want to see it over and over!
","This is one of those rare movies which is so good on so many levels that the whole family can enjoy it over and over again. The villains are villainous, the heroes are believable and heroic and endearing, and the fun is non-stop. I would put this film in the same class as Matilda and It's a Wonderful Life, i.e. thrilling and uplifting entertainment for everyone, with a generous dose of humor to keep everything from getting too serious. The animation is truly remarkable and fast-paced, including the many flying sequences on the dragons. The creativity is also astounding - there is one sequence in which one animated character imitates the persona of another. Do not miss this movie!",10,3,7,4 July 2014
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Jonah Jameson was right! Spiderman is a turkey!
","They spent a fortune and ended up with this web-slinging turkey. This is not just your average bad movie. This expensive monstrosity joins that rare club of the really, really expensive ($200 million) and really, really bad, right up there with 'Cleopatra,' 'Pirates of the Caribbean,' and 'Waterworld.' You know it's bad when you have an 'action' movie in which the scrawny, goofy, lead actor (Andrew Garfield) spends more time sniveling and moaning and crying and blubbering than the leading lady (Emma Stone) and supporting actress (Sally Field) combined. You know it's bad when you squirm in your seat every time the lead actor contorts his face into another forced attempt to convey noble suffering. You know it's bad when the poor schmuck who's destined to become one of the lead villains climbs precariously over a tank of swarming electric eels, and you squirm in your seat again waiting for him to fall in and change into...wait for it...'Electro.' A hole in the head is what you need this movie like.",1,14,45,2 May 2014
In Time," Umpteenth recycling of the Marxist fable - don't waste time on 'In Time'
","Ugh. Here we go again. Huge amounts of mental and financial (dare I say it?) capital invested in pretentious retelling of the Marxist fable about the bourgeois, the proletariat, inequality of capital, and how redistribution will fix it all. Stop me if you've heard this one before, but...(I was screaming STOP mentally about 10 minutes into the movie).I gave this movie a 2 for all the neat explosions, gunfire, car chases, and lavish sets. The idea of using time as a metaphor for money also deserves a 2, for minimal creativity, since even Marx's antithesis, John Locke, who predated Marx by a century, taught that property (capital) was created by labor (time spent working).It has always astounded me that so many people could be fooled by a bitter, envious, perverse man (Marx) who wrote an immense tome on a subject (capital) of which he was clueless, like a eunuch writing a sex manual. After a century, Marxism maintains its perfect losing streak - death, poverty, refugees, falling life expectancy, starvation, about 100 million victims of executions and gulags in China, the USSR, Cuba, etc. Perhaps someday a REALLY brave Hollywood studio will make a movie about this abominable story. Don't hold your breath.And don't waste your time on 'In Time.'",2,13,29,29 October 2011
There Will Be Blood," There will be loathsome attempts to brainwash you...
","Lets' see. We have a film here with certain recurring themes which will set bells ringing furiously, at least for some of us. Here's a short list: 1. Oil industry - very bad 2. Religion - very bad 3. Capitalism - evil 4. America - a general hellhole 5. Entrepreneurs - demonic Are you starting to get my drift? Does this sound like the Obama administration version of American History 101? That's because this film is based on a book by that vile old socialist, Upton Sinclair. Chalk another one up for the Cultural Marxists! Funny, those Hollywood Cultural Marxists never seems to give us a film about how atheistic socialism racked up about 100 million victims in the 20th century. Oh well.",1,3,10,12 July 2011
"Hail, Caesar!"," In a class all its own - profound, magnificent and yet funny - one of my all time top ten films!
","This movie is a success on so many levels that it is hard to do it justice in a short review, but here goes. Superficially, the film is a light-hearted comedy about the foibles of people in the 1950s Hollywood film industry, which are just glamorized, larger-than-life sins and failings of humans in general - immorality, stupidity, intoxication and the like - magnified by dramatic nature of the movie trade and the secondary, parasitic gossip-publication industry. The real genius of 'Hail, Caesar,' however, is the way the surface narrative is intricately and artfully interwoven with one of the central struggles of 20th Century history, in a way that is subtle yet deeply moving. This struggle, which continues today, is the battle for the hearts and minds of mankind, a battle between the god of the Almighty Secular State (in this movie, Soviet Communism) and the God of the Bible. The protagonist, Baird Whitlock (played by George Clooney), is an actor kidnapped by a communist cell and held for ransom. He is almost swayed to the communist cause by the persuasive rants of the various cell members (including the detestable Professor Herbert Marcuse, who was a real-life American professor with an incredibly potent, destructive legacy). The 'fixer' who works for Whitlock's studio (Eddie Mannix, played brilliantly by Josh Brolin) recovers Whitlock and literally slaps the commie nonsense out of him, restoring him to productive sanity. The three minutes in the movie where a rabbi, a Catholic priest, an Eastern Orthodox priest, and a Protestant minister debate the acceptability of the movie studio's depiction of Christ is comedy gold. Do not miss this movie, especially if you were born after 1970!",10,6,10,21 February 2016
Prometheus," Incomprehensible rubbish
","Yet another movie that leaves you scratching your head and saying 'So?' at the end of the film. Incomprehensible from the get-go, where some alien drinks what appears to be poison and rots away rapidly. What does it mean? If it's that abstruse, what's the message? Is this hinting at the goofy theory of panspermia (life on Earth was seeded by aliens)? So who created the aliens who created life on Earth? Like I say, goofy. Then there's every radical feminist's dream, the scene with the self- administered abortion. Oy Gevalt! What a dog's breakfast.",1,2,8,30 July 2017
Wonder Woman," A letdown for two reasons
","This was an entertaining movie, but I don't think I would recommend it to anyone else, for two reasons. First, the issue of Wonder Woman's powers is very confusing and inconsistent. In this movie, she seemingly starts out as just another Amazonian chick, but ends up flying through the air like Superman. This seems to follow a pattern in her previous comic book and TV incarnations. In some cases, she had to have the glass (invisible) plane to fly, but at other times she could fly alone, like Superman. Secondly, I was disappointed to learn that Wonder Woman's creator, William Moulton Marston, was a seedy, loathsome character (see Wikipedia for the details on his menage a trois and fondness for eugenicist Margaret Sanger). Hopefully this excellent actress, Gal Gadot, will find a better vehicle for her talents in the future.",3,2,14,5 June 2017
Lucy," Please don't waste your time and money
","OK, I thought this movie might turn out to be really cool, since I loved Besson's The Fifth Element, and who doesn't like Scarlet Johansson and Morgan Freeman? BOY WAS I WRONG!!!! This movie is a dog's breakfast of CGI special effects, gruesome violence, brief but raunchy animal and human sex clips, explosions, car chases, gun fights, and rehashed indoctrination about Darwinian, dead-as-a-dodo macroevolution.I have flagged this review as a spoiler alert because I am assuming it is a spoiler to reveal this incomprehensible movie has no real message or plot, so you will be left blinking at the end of the film and saying 'That's it? So what is the message?' I am on a mission to spare others from this noxious turkey of a film!",1,27,56,10 August 2014
Looper," Gruesome dystopia
","I made the huge mistake of ignoring the R rating and taking my 12 year old to this movie. That's my own stupid fault. Don't repeat my mistake with your child. Or, for that matter, ANY adult, including yourself. This bleak morsel of cinematic gristle will have you rummaging for your Prozac in short order. Looper contains plenty of the usual, gratuitous sewage, including drug addiction, poverty, mindless sex, brutal torture and dismemberment, explosions and shootings. To this dog's breakfast is added a liberal seasoning of F-bombs, urban blight, and telekinetic special effects. If there's any redemptive message here, it's 'get on your knees and get right with Jesus, lest you end up in this living hell!'",1,8,19,20 October 2012
John Wick: Chapter 2," Gruesome, incomprehensible, time-wasting gore-fest
","This movie doesn't seem like a movie. It's more like an AVI file created from some stoner playing an assassin video game for two hours. The plot is incomprehensible and poorly explained by the script. Waves and waves of assailants get their brains splattered out the back of their heads by John Wick. There's an occasional knife-fight and stabbing to break the monotony of the brain-splattering bullets. The dog was the most sympathetic and understandable character in the film, and he, of course, has no speaking role. Please don't punish yourself and waste your precious moment of life with this movie. Read a good book instead - preferably with much less brain-splattering",1,2,8,21 April 2019
