Catch Me If You Can," Really smart movie
","To tell the truth, for a long time I rejected to watch the movie, as I didn't like 50-60's movies at all, no matter what actor staff plays. So, one day, I took the DVD of 'Catch me if you can' out of my bookshelf, (it was dusty, cos no one touched it for a long time). Began watching... and, bum! I fell in love with it! Especially I liked Leonardo so much! I just couldn't stand him before, you know! So, this movie completely changed my mind about both Leonardo DiCaprio and 50-60's movies. Movie's excellence is provided by: -at first, talents of actors, especially, DiCaprio, Tom Hanks; -at second, extremely interesting and intriguing screenplay.Well, watch it and enjoy!",10,2,3,27 April 2009
