Hereditary," Strange, not scary
",Well acted but a rather bizarre story which doesn't pull the audience in. There is no emotional attachment to any of the characters and the art-house style photography alienates rather than captivates. Excellent reviews are rather confusing as there are many better horror or suspense films out there.,2,1,3,27 October 2018
Us," Garbage
","Normally the IMDB scores give a good guide as to how good a film is going to be, but I'm afraid this time it was so wide of the mark. Convoluted plot, terrible ham suspense, poor character development and dreadful script. Very basic, low level film making and screenplay even with two leads who have done good work elsewhere. Little to recommend.",2,1,2,29 May 2020
