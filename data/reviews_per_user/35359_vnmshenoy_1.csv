Hereditary," Decent movie but not worth the hype
","Its a decent movie but not worth the hype around it though. According to me, Its not exactly to the level of conjuring,insidious etc let alone exorcist. Movie is good and has few horror scenes here and there. But i think the movie is creepy, and has slow screenplay. First I thought slow screenplay helped ,but i think it was overdid. I watched the movie with my friend, and after watching the whole movie, we still have many questions in our mind which i think are not clearly depicted in the movie. And may be that's what the idea is as well, expecting us to put the pieces together. I would say its a good one time watch if you have nothing else to do.",5,3,6,9 June 2018
