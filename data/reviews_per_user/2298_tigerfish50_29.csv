The Lobster," An Over-Cooked Crustacean
","'The Lobster' proposes a pointless, puerile premise - that a society exists where people who fail to maintain a relationship with their spouse are sent to re-education camps. This rehab for singles takes the form of a regimented bourgeois hotel where the guests must find a replacement partner within 45 days. If they succeed, they are permitted to return to a dreary urban existence with their new significant other. If they fail to hook up with another person, the hapless losers are exiled to the surrounding forest where they are hunted down with tranquilizer guns, prior to being surgically transformed into an animal. This fatuous fable is delivered with the vitality of a robot's daydream. The expressionless acting style and wooden script produces only tedium, punctuated by some random episodes of theatrical silliness and unpleasant cruelty. It's hard to see the point of this pretentious allegory - it could be a critique of society's regimentation or a caricature of transmigration, but then again, it might not. It's excessively generous to spend thirty seconds considering whether this dull farce possesses any meaning.",1,46,77,10 June 2016
Blade Runner 2049," A Pedestrian Labyrinth
","There's no disputing 'Blade Runner 2049' looks good - the vast decaying LA megalopolis, its futuristic interiors and surrounding desert wasteland are all portrayed with beautiful cinematography - but unfortunately the narrative arc doesn't match up to the scenery.This sequel starts off in familiar territory - just like detective Rick Deckard in the original movie, a replicant police officer called 'K' is tasked with terminating unreliable earlier models. In the film's opening sequence he's hunting down one of his targets, and during this operation K comes across evidence of the birth of a replicant child. He's soon reassigned to find this offspring, and K's new mission obliges him to do a lot of zigzagging around the dystopian landscape in his flying police cruiser. He asks awkward questions of important people, and delves into the archives of secretive institutions. This detective work seems unnecessarily opaque and long-winded, even though it's punctuated by some sporadic violence. Occasionally K stops by his cramped apartment where he carries on an unsatisfying love affair with his hologram girlfriend. The clues eventually lead to the standard overwrought cliffhanger climax, but the lasting impression - despite the film's visual impact, blockbuster budget and continuing references to the Theseus myth - is that it's all a bit underwhelming.",6,24,51,15 October 2017
Gravity," Spiralling into a vacuous void
","'Gravity' begins with an extravagant visual flourish - a shuttle crew is servicing the Hubble telescope while planet Earth revolves majestically several hundred miles beneath them. As they work, news of a satellite collision arrives from mission control. The distant incident quickly turns into a dire emergency when a cloud of lethal debris zeroes in upon the astronauts. Mayhem ensues - and within seconds the shuttle vehicle is transformed into a destroyed and useless hulk.When the dust has cleared, two space-suited astronauts find themselves alone and adrift in the immensity of space. In the real world there would be zero chance of survival - so the film is festooned with ludicrous science as it transforms itself into a juvenile comic book adventure. The cornball script confines the one-dimensional characters to lame banter and maudlin sentimentality as a series of implausible cliffhanger exploits play out against the backdrop of spectacular special effects. Despite its box-office success, 'Gravity' is just another featherweight tale from Hollywood, 'full of sound and fury, signifying nothing'.",1,144,278,16 October 2013
Passengers," Romantic Disaster in Space
","The trailer for 'Passengers' promises mystery and suspense, but the finished product is just a luke-warm romance spiced up with some tepid thrills at the conclusion. Its threadbare plot kicks off several hundred years in the future, with a spaceship encountering comet debris a quarter way through its 120 year journey to another solar system. The vessel sustains damage and starts to malfunction, awakening one of the 5000 hibernating colonists aboard. With no way to put himself back to sleep, this unlucky Jim faces the dismal prospect of spending the rest of his life alone on the vessel. Unaware of a growing crisis in the ship's vitals, Jim passes the next year discussing his dilemma with a supercilious android bartender, playing solo basketball and unsuccessfully trying to break into the sleeping crew's quarters to seek help. Eventually he decides to wake another colonist - an airhead journalist called Aurora - for some company and romance.After this so-so set-up, it's soon clear screenwriter Spaihts has nowhere to go, and his script's most appropriate destination would have been the Black Hole of a producer's waste-bin. The 'Prometheus' debacle should have purged Spaihts of his obsession with interstellar basketball and smug androids, but apparently not, because Jim and Aurora's embarrassing flirtations are portrayed through extra basketball practice and more chats with the Jeeves-bot bartender. After some disco-dancing classes, the ship's system failures become impossible to ignore, and this juvenile melodrama limps into its half-baked climax.",1,72,142,25 December 2016
The Irishman," Fantasies of a Wannabe Hit-man
","Based on the rest home recollections of a geriatric former gangster, 'The Irishman' adds another long-winded chapter to Scorcese's collection of mob potboilers. As far as authenticity is concerned, Frank Sheeran was renowned for being a liar and drunk - and neither his former associates nor FBI investigators believed his boasts of being a mob hit-man. Instead they remember him as a minor thug who would never have been entrusted with serious matters like the claimed killing of his pal Jimmy Hoffa. In the film's far-fetched version of this notorious crime, Hoffa's son observed Sheeran as the last person in his father's company, but somehow this goon never appeared on the FBI's radar as a suspect.An elderly De Niro is unconvincingly rendered into youthful middle age by CGI, as Scorcese trudges through Sheeran's catalogue of imaginary murders with the energy of an accountant filling out a tax return. The actor pastes a stone-faced 'tough guy' expression on his face as his crime boss (Joe Pesci) instructs him to eliminate rats and rivals in obscure code phrases such as 'painting houses'. This jargon was also invented by Sheeran in order to make him look like an insider, although the Gotti tapes revealed genuine mobsters use simpler terminology like: 'Whack the bum'.The film's final act depicts Sheeran in an elder care facility, revealing the retired hoodlum as an empty husk, devoid of empathy or insight. 'The Irishman' is just as formulaic as the superhero schlock Scorcese has recently criticized, but the Oscar babble is already deafening. The only question raised by this tired movie is why a veteran film-maker remains fascinated by the violence, cowardice and greed of these dismal lowlifes.",1,40,79,2 December 2019
Spotlight," Flushing Rats out of the Sewer
","'Spotlight' provides a riveting look at the Boston Globe investigation of the Roman Catholic pedophile priest scandal. As almost everybody knows, the church hierarchy concealed their knowledge of numerous priests who were molesting and raping under-age parishioners. The cover-up of these serious felonies was orchestrated through pay-offs and arm-twisting by Boston's archbishop, the despicable Cardinal Bernard Law. This corrupt cleric seemed to rule over the city, and his criminal negligence allowed the depraved activity to continue for many years.The victims were countless Bostonians who endured this abuse and had their lives ruined. The heroes were an embattled lawyer, a resolute editor and a small group of persistent journalists who dismantled the obfuscation and red tape of respected authority figures and entrenched institutions. The villains were Law, his venal church and the priests who pretended piety while they preyed upon the young. 'Spotlight' tells this twisted tale with excellent writing, direction and acting. It's worth noting Law fled to Rome after the scandal broke, was given an honorary position and still lives in comfort in a Vatican palace. In 2012 he was the prime lobbyist against giving women more responsibility in the church. Nothing much appears to have changed in the RC Boys' Club.",8,6,12,15 March 2016
Shutter Island," Psychological suspense mystery lacking mystery, suspense and psychology
","A pair of detectives arrive at a fog-bound island where a dangerous female patient has mysteriously disappeared from her cell in a mental asylum. 'Shutter Island' crudely announces its grandiose delusions as the soundtrack blares the two men are entering a world of mystery and danger. Unfortunately it's also signaling the introduction of a tired collection of generic characters, wasted talent, mundane screen writing and melodramatic directing. The plot's big twist is obvious within the first 15 minutes, after which it plods relentlessly on to the 'surprise' denouement. All suspense having drained away at an early stage - something of a drawback in a suspense film - there's little to hold an audience's interest, so the film stagnates like a bloated whale.Since artists frequently steal ideas from one another, it shouldn't be a serious problem that the basic concept has been taken from a much earlier German film - only that it has been re-imagined in such a prosaic manner. The core idea is a clever conceit, but it requires subtle handling which seems utterly beyond Scorcese. It's difficult to remember another mystery thriller with Shutter Island's rich production values resulting in such a desperate state of boredom.",1,12,25,28 July 2010
Interstellar," Sappy sentimentality and silly science
","'Memento' and 'Inception' had some problems, but their ideas stretched the imagination. 'Interstellar' only delivers the bombastic silliness one would expect if a puffed-up Batman director thought he could eclipse Kubrick's '2001' with a puerile adventure story. Christopher Nolan's new film begins badly and steadily declines as its long-winded prologue introduces the stereotypical elements of a Steven Spielberg/Norman Rockwell Sci-Fi co-production - a widowed ex-astronaut farmer, his chiseled jaw, a feisty daughter, a crusty grandpa, a dying Earth, dust storms, paranormal activity, baseball, cornfields - and lots of corn.After about an hour - which seems like two - a valiant crew lifts off in search of a planet to save humanity. Once they've journeyed through an intergalactic wormhole, the implausibility dimension expands to cosmic levels. Scientific hocus-pocus is stirred into the sentimental sludge as gigantic tsunamis, deranged astronauts, spaceship chases, time travel tomfoolery and black hole baloney eventually lead to a schmaltzy Hallmark-style climax. The visual effects are above average, but far short of awesome. When all is said and done, the film's self-importance and mawkishness leave one rooting for humanity's extinction.",1,39,83,5 December 2014
Lion," A Prodigal Lost in a Labyrinth
","'Lion' tells the story of one of the 80,000 children who go missing in India each year. One evening, a 6YO boy called Saroo accompanies his older brother who is searching for work in a nearby town. Left alone at a deserted railway station, he wanders into a stationary train to sleep, and awakens to find himself locked inside an empty moving carriage. One thousand miles later, he disembarks in Calcutta, and quickly becomes lost among its teeming masses. For a while Saroo exists on the streets of this vast megalopolis, ignorant of his own full name and that of his home town. He survives human predators of various kinds, before he's taken in by a sinister orphanage. Eventually he's sent for adoption to Australia, and many years later begins the search for his original family.Producers are well aware what kind of 'real' stories appeal to mass audiences, and like so many other based-on-true-story projects, 'Lion' is hemmed in by facts. The film is rescued to some extent by excellent acting, but nobody should expect any big surprises - the ending is obvious from the trailer. The script milks the material for maximum emotional impact, which encourages the viewer to forget about the fate of the other 79,999 lost souls.",5,3,7,20 January 2017
Salt," A Moth-eaten Heroine and a Truckload of Tripe
","Movie producers' contempt for their customers is legendary, and 'Salt' is a prime example of their pathological greed. In this case they couldn't even be bothered to concoct a fresh plot, as yet another megalomaniac clique plans to start World War 3 by assassinating the US and Russian presidents. The genre was mercilessly satirized by the Austin Powers franchise more than a decade ago, and this ludicrous example insults everybody above the mental age of twelve.The story makes little sense, as the attempt at world domination by group of power-crazed conspirators is foiled by one of their own mole triple agents. The film's conveyor belt of action sequences is clearly the point of the exercise, as the stunt doubles of an anorexic Jolie spend almost two hours jumping from roof to roof of various speeding vehicles, and vanquishing hundreds of heavily armed assailants. The public seems to possess an insatiable appetite for escapist fantasies, and garbage like 'Salt' allows a cynical industry to take their money and laugh at them behind their backs.",1,7,13,2 August 2011
Silver Linings Playbook," Nice set-up - lame conclusion
","After his release from a mental institution, a bi-polar ex-teacher called Pat wants to reconcile with his unfaithful wife. She's taken out a restraining order to prevent him from making contact, so he enlists the help of a female acquaintance. The troubled Tiffany has problems of her own - she's a young widow using sexual promiscuity to deal with the grief of losing her husband - but she agrees to act as Pat's go-between if he partners her in a dance competition. Since 'Silver Linings Playbook' is a romantic comedy, Pat and Tiffany's unusual arrangement soon develops an emotional element. Jennifer Lawrence breathes her quirky brand of combative femininity into Tiffany, but it's not enough to save the film, since everybody else is playing the fool. Whenever she's on-screen, the story has vitality, but instead of exploring this off-beat relationship between a couple of misfits, the narrative detours into a slapstick sub-plot about a small-time gambling operation run by Pat's father. Most of the film's potential degenerates into farce and sentimentality long before it concludes with a formulaic climax at the dance contest. Although it's been a huge box-office success, this play-book only has a cardboard lining.",1,4,10,19 April 2015
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Ho-hum Hollywood Hokum
","'Once Upon a Time . . .' continues Tarantino's decline as a writer and director, although the principal weakness of his latest film is a rambling screenplay which develops neither story nor characters. Set in LA at the time of the notorious Manson Family killings, the relationship between fading alcoholic TV star Rick, and his long-time stunt double Cliff takes center stage. Unfortunately neither man has much personality, the pair share a tired connection and their exchanges never hint at the electricity between Vincent and Jules in 'Pulp Fiction', or Louis and Ordell in 'Jackie Brown'.The movie looks decent enough, but oodles of time is wasted venerating the trashy films and TV shows of that era. There's an endless passage where Rick delivers some routine over-acting as a cowboy villain in a formulaic TV pilot, inter-cut with Sharon Tate visiting a cinema to watch a spoof spy movie in which she had a minor role. Voice-overs laboriously explain the narrative gaps as more than a hundred minutes are spent on a procession of scenes which do little more than provide background. Eventually, the ghostly apparition of an actual story emerges after Cliff gives one of Manson's hippie runaways a ride to the derelict movie ranch where the 'Family' were residing. The ensuing confrontation shows the potential of Tarantino's idea - but he loses the plot again in order to pay homage to spaghetti westerns.The 'action' finally arrives at an overblown climax which gives Tarantino yet another opportunity to show off his chops as a director of theatrical violence. He gives reality a fairy tale tweak in this last act, but it's hard to think of the film as anything more than self-indulgent fluff.",1,219,417,2 August 2019
Gone Girl," Girl Out to Lunch
","'Gone Girl' begins with a married man, Nick, returning to his suburban home to find an open door, broken furniture, blood spatters and his wife Amy missing. Within a couple of days, Nick's account of an idyllic marriage starts falling apart, and the local police begin to suspect he's a wife-killer. Ominous clues are discovered, while a tabloid talk-show host ramps up public hysteria with gossipy revelations supplied by one of Amy's neighborhood pals. Director Fincher encourages his audience to join this vilification of Nick as flashbacks portray the couple's troubled relationship from entries in Amy's diary.Although the film possesses a few innovative ideas, it ends up a trashy melodrama. The big revelation arrives far too early, and the last third of 'Gone Girl' becomes increasingly far-fetched as any residual tension evaporates. The characters remain resolutely shallow, so there's little reason to care what happens to them as the tale starts drowning in a morass of plot-holes - and by the time it reaches its conclusion, an intriguing mystery has been completely transformed into farce.",1,13,24,16 February 2016
Ex Machina," Chess games with androids
","Film-makers have been making 'big' films about artificial intelligence for decades, but few of them had much serious content. Writer/director Alex Garland has a history of coming up with implausible overblown ideas, but 'Ex Machina' avoids these pitfalls. It takes a scaled-down look at the topic in a savvy sober screenplay which is nicely complemented by the acting, design and direction.A young employee of a hugely successful IT company wins the opportunity to spend a week with its technocrat CEO at the man's remote estate. On arrival, he discovers his boss wants him to assess the personality of a female android, which has been equipped with advanced AI. The resulting narrative is a noir psychological Sci-Fi suspense film, which plays out in a claustrophobic modernist house perched above a rushing river in a pristine forest wilderness. Each of the three characters has a hidden agenda, and manipulates the situation to accomplish their goal. As the film approaches its intense conclusion, it becomes apparent one of them is several moves ahead of the others.",8,2,6,11 July 2015
Event Horizon," Derelict Spaceship Lands in a Haunted House
","There are numerous Sci-Fi films jostling at the front of the pack for the 'Worst Ever' accolade, and 'Event Horizon' should certainly be considered one of the top contenders. Although the film has upscale production values, penny-pinching in the screen-writing budget becomes obvious as soon as the characters open their mouths. The story's introduction reveals an experimental faster-than-light spaceship had gone missing on its maiden flight. Seven years later it has mysteriously reappeared orbiting Neptune, and another vessel is dispatched to investigate.On board this rescue ship, the astronauts are bickering like toddlers long before they arrive at their destination. When an exploratory team ventures into the derelict hulk's industrial-Gothic interior, their intelligence goes into terminal decline as the hack screenplay plunges them into a crude gore-and-horror fest. They start screaming at one another like hysterics, while the soundtrack ramps up the melodrama in a lame attempt to disguise the deficiencies of the material. None of the routine nastiness makes any sense, and the eventual explanation for the vessel's cursed condition is pitifully weak. After '2001' and 'Alien' had shown the possibilities for modern Sci-Fi, 'Event Horizon' is a severe disappointment which gives the entire genre a bad name.",1,11,23,27 July 2014
Midsommar," A Mild Case of Midsommar Madness
","Cinema audiences' admiring response to 'Midsommar' is the most mysterious aspect of this ho-hum 'horror' film which shamelessly copycats 'The Wicker Man'. The story begins with the murder-suicide of a female college student's parents and sister - and this tragedy supposedly motivates her to accept an invitation to visit the religious community where a fellow student from Sweden had been raised.Accompanied by her semi-estranged boyfriend and a couple of disposable pals, the visitors arrive at their destination and the narrative immediately goes downhill. Instead of growing tension and menace at the remote hamlet, the creepy cultists offer long-winded rituals, tedious chanting and absurd occult beliefs. The story never develops the witless students into sympathetic characters, nor the peasant-costumed pagans into truly sinister villains. As a result, when bad things start happening, it's impossible to care about any of the rustic weirdness or the ultimate fate of the fall-guys.",1,22,37,9 November 2019
Elysium," Dick Cheney's Ringworld
","Writer/director Blomkamp's breakthrough work was 'District 9' - a simple plot driven by fairly original concepts and techniques - and it was a big success. Predictably the new 'wunderkind' was given a bloated budget for his follow-up project - and it's resulted in a major letdown with a trite story undermined by implausible ideas. The film is set about 150 years in the future, with mankind living on a polluted, over-populated earth, and being exploited by a fascist elite who control the masses by means of a robot police force. The privileged minority reside on Elysium, a vast orbiting space station which resembles a luxurious Beverly Hills gated community. One of the earthbound serfs is the standard action-movie hero: a tough-but-sensitive ex-con called Max. After being exposed to a fatal dose of radiation at his robot-factory workplace, he needs to access the forbidden medical facilities on Elysium - and during his struggles to save himself, Max becomes entangled in a 'coup d'etat' planned by the station's megalomaniac female head of security.Although the film looks good, Blomkamp provides little reason to care about anybody, since the participants act like manic puppets with incomprehensible motivations. He attempts to conceal the yawning gaps in his story by getting the characters to shout at one another, and engage in endless shoot-outs with CGI robots - all of which produces little more than brain-addling tedium.",1,28,55,19 September 2013
La La Land," Lack-Luster Land
","It's hard to understand how this lifeless musical has done so well at the box office, and swept up so many awards and nominations. The film goes downhill fast after an impressive opening song-and-dance routine on a gridlocked Interstate overpass. As soon as the traffic starts rolling again, this love story between a jazz pianist and wannabe actress gets underway with a prescient gesture. Thanks to interruptions for some undistinguished musical numbers, it takes them almost an hour and several coincidental meetings before they're sufficiently motivated to kick-start their tepid romance. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be much glue holding them together, and they soon have an unconvincing argument about chasing their respective dreams. This leads to a brief break-up, followed by a half-hearted reconciliation. Later it's revealed they parted - presumably because they weren't all that into each other in the first place - but the script doesn't bother to show how this separation occurred. As the narrative approaches its conclusion, LA's infamous traffic congestion facilitates yet another meeting and a final chance to ignite some drama. The biggest mystery is why so many critics and viewers admire this drab love affair between two people who seem unable to communicate either affection or passion.",1,23,51,5 February 2017
The Fountain," Nonsensical ado about nothing
","'Requiem For a Dream' was a powerful, shocking and original piece of storytelling, but anyone expecting something similar from 'The Fountain' on the strength of Aronofsky's earlier project is likely to be astonished at his latest film's ineptitude. In an attempt at epic scale the director has conceived a trilogy spanning light years and millenniums, but none of the three narratives from three different eras possesses a shred of credibility or vitality - and the end result is meaningless blather about the deathless nature of love.A Conquistador quest set in Inquisition Spain and South America plays like a mash-up of Conan and Underworld. A frantic search for a death-cure in a near contemporary laboratory is a hackneyed Twilight Zone melodrama drowning in tragic sentimentality and bad acting. A metaphysical space odyssey segment resembles a tired Star Trek episode directed by the Brothers Grimm. If this film hadn't been dressed up in some moody cinematography and art direction, everybody would instantly recognize it for what it is - a triumph of intoxicated self-importance over substance.",1,4,9,6 April 2010
American Made," American Mess
","It's naive to expect truth from 'based-on-true-story' projects, but narrative content should be required ingredient. 'American Made' plays like a movie trailer throughout its two-hour length, stirring together the standard motifs of 1980s cocaine smuggling sagas like 'Blow'. The story boils down to a procession of mustachioed Colombian cartel bosses, DEA agents and drug-courier aviators hauling cocaine, firearms and bags of cash around jungle landing strips, hotel lobbies and small town banks in the ugly fashions of the day.Tom Cruise portrays pilot protagonist Barry Seal as an easygoing coke-smuggling, gun-running, Caddy-driving adventurer. His self-deprecating charm and aerial dare-devilry are supposed to hold the film together, but both charisma and exploits seem stale. After the CIA persuade Seal to aid their anti-communist follies in Central America, he fends off the various suspicions and demands of his dumb blonde wife, crooked associates and two-faced CIA handlers. The script never develops any of these stock characters as the story unfolds with the depth of a music video. At the conclusion, there's little reason to believe a word of it, or care what happens to any of the participants.",1,67,130,6 October 2017
12 Years a Slave," Abducted to a Southern hell
","Considering the social and economic importance of slavery in America's history, the scarcity of serious films depicting the daily life of slaves in the Confederate States is significant - especially since the after-effects from this shameful episode still echo through the culture. '12 Years a Slave' is based upon the memoirs of Solomon Northup, who endured a hellish period of enslavement in Louisiana, which is backed up by legal records.The story begins with him living with wife and children in upstate New York as a free man and respected member of his community. After being lured to Washington by a couple of con-artists who promised him work, he was subsequently drugged, locked in chains, viciously beaten, stripped of his identity and shipped to New Orleans to be sold into slavery. Over the next twelve years, he was owned by two men who treated him in contrasting ways. The first was a relatively civilized fellow, but the plantation's half-witted manager was threatened by Northup's superior intelligence. Their mutual dislike produced a dangerously volatile situation, and unwilling to lose his investment, Northup's owner re-sold him to a neighbor. This unbalanced individual regarded his slaves as property to be used for pleasure and profit, which caused them to live in perpetual fear that his capricious moods would flare into sadistic lust or rage at any moment.It's noteworthy that a British director has become one of the few filmmakers to delve deeply into this subject, and the combination of John Ridley's powerful script and McQueen's directorial skills has inspired exceptional performances from the entire cast. Their dramatization of Northup's experiences is both riveting and uncomfortable to watch, as the film depicts the perverse nature of a society that permitted such a barbaric system. Hopefully it will reach a large US audience, who will learn how a privileged Southern elite cruelly exploited their fellow humans in order to acquire greater wealth for themselves.",9,148,259,22 September 2013
"Hail, Caesar!"," Hail, Coenceit!
","Occasionally the Coen Brothers turn out films with a little substance, but these days it's mostly powder-puff satirical comedies. 'Hail Caesar' belongs firmly in the latter category, with its absurd tale of a lead actor kidnapped by a clique of Communist intellectuals from the set of a campy melodrama about Ancient Roman legionnaires. The studio's Mr Fix-It searches for his lost star while he pacifies the inflated egos of actors, directors and gossip columnists and negotiates with a potential new employer. After about twenty minutes, it becomes obvious the farcical story is just an excuse to serve up some pastiches of 1950s-era movie scenes being filmed on the lot.The theatrical frolics combined with the half-baked mystery might produce a couple of weak chuckles, but little more. The plot is both fragmented and threadbare, the characters are all stereotypes, and their exchanges no more meaningful than Saturday Night Live skits. There are plenty of insider jokes and caricatures of movie-land personalities, but that's insufficient reason to spend ten seconds analyzing this self-satisfied trifle for subtexts. It's an unambitious, insulting mess, and a waste of everybody's time.",1,41,75,20 February 2016
Arrival," First Contact! Close Encounters with Clichés
","'Arrival' begins well, but ends up a major disappointment after twelve huge egg-shaped spacecraft arrive on Earth and hover a few feet above the ground at various locations around the globe. Initially it takes a novel approach - instead of ray-gun battles, the world's finest linguists are corralled by national authorities to enable communication with the aliens, who resemble an octopus/elephant hybrid. Each host country competes to unravel the Octophant language, selfishly hoping to acquire advantages over rival nations. Unfortunately the meetings between extraterrestrials and linguists aboard the vessels quickly become repetitive, thereby squelching any sense of awe over humanity's first contact with intelligent life from beyond our solar system. This loss of dramatic tension becomes a serious problem as 'Arrival's' plucky heroine struggles to decipher the aliens' complex circular hieroglyphics. The actors' performances are more than adequate for the material, but the narrative arc becomes increasingly predictable. As the story unfolds, it leans stubbornly upon the old Sci-Fi cliché of mankind's paranoia and xenophobia. The Earthbound military powers foolishly adopt a threatening attitude toward the ETs, who obviously possess more advanced technologies. The screenwriters deploy some equally foolish plot devices as the film charges headlong into a formulaic Hollywood cliff-hanger climax, before it winds up wallowing in sentimental hokum.",1,11,21,26 November 2016
Mother!," From Eden to Armageddon in 2 Hours
","Darren Aronofsky invariably churns out flaccid potboilers when he attempts to impress audiences with his intellectual virility. From the opening scene of 'Mother', he cranks the Pretentiousness dial up to 11 as a young woman wakes alone in the bedroom of an isolated country house. Her husband is absent, so she wanders about in an agitated state searching for him. After she finds him, their wooden conversation reveals he's a poet with writer's block. Later that day, a stranger knocks at the door, and the poet invites him to stay after learning he's a fan of his work. The next morning, the man's wife arrives - soon followed by a pair of bickering sons.These six characters proceed to act out a fatuous re-telling of the Genesis myth depicting the antics of God, Nature, Adam, Eve, Cain and Abel. With acting, direction and screen-writing at the level of amateur dramatics, Aronofsky presents God as a vain, manipulative, impotent older man, Nature as his whiny trophy wife, the Creation as their residence and the rest of human history as an out-of-control house party. After Noah's flood is symbolized by some drunken vandalism, burst pipes and a soggy kitchen, mankind's sorry tale grinds on into the 20th century. Eventually it arrives at Aronofsky's puerile imagining of Armageddon, which comes not a moment too soon.",1,25,41,1 October 2017
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Can fluff sink like a stone?
","Each Woody Allen film seems to be worse than its predecessor, and this one continues the free-fall - although nothing could ever be quite so appalling as 'Scoop'. In this example, we find the city of Barcelona resembling a glossy 1960's travelogue with an annoying voice-over droning endlessly about the shallow dilemmas of a collection of characters plucked from some back-lot limbo of romance-fiction rejects.The plot (such as it is) tells the story of a suave, tormented artist, Juan, attired in his Playboy-approved red satin shirt, who sets about luring two American nymphets into his bed. Unfortunately for these vapid young women, Juan is still emotionally involved with his ex-wife, Maria, who is portrayed as a stereotypical Latina spitfire with suicidal impulses. Nothing much that approaches drama, comedy or interest occurs during the film, which allows an audience to focus on the characters - or lack of them. Women should be justifiably incensed by the portrayal of Allen's females as silly, self-absorbed, easily-manipulated neurotics - but 'Vicky Christina Barcelona' is an equal-opportunity disaster - the self-entitlement and pomposity of the male characters makes them even more unlikable.",1,9,19,22 July 2010
Lucy," A cinematic Neanderthal
","'Lucy' tries to be both an action-thriller and intellectually provocative, but succeeds in neither of these ambitions. The film's tired plot relates how some blood-thirsty Chinese drug traffickers attempt to corner the market with a new designer drug. After sewing packages of the substance into the stomachs of some reluctant mules, they blackmail them to fly to Europe with the contraband. Apparently these incompetent mobsters haven't properly tested their product, and are ignorant that an overdose can endow its consumer with extraordinary physical powers and intelligence. When one of the packages leaks, a ditsy blonde mule metamorphoses into Superwoman. The plot-holes are gigantic, so writer/director Luc Besson attempts to distract the audience with his standard menu of theatrical fights, car chases, shoot-outs and gratuitous violence. These stale leftovers are served up with some pretentious babbling about the drug's mutations projecting humanity up the evolutionary ladder. Unfortunately 'Lucy' only signifies another dead-end in film-making.",1,13,26,28 November 2015
Life," Alien Out to Lunch
","'Life' has state-of-the-art production values, but its sophomoric science and scientists would be sneered at by kindergartners. The story begins as a robot probe carrying a cargo of soil samples from Mars arrives at the International Space Station in unnecessarily melodramatic fashion. The follies continue inside the station's 'fail-safe' isolation lab, after a biologist revives a Martian organism which has been in suspended animation for the last 3 billion years. The tiny creature seems cute at first and is named Calvin, but he soon escapes from his cell in the orbiting Supermax prison - and like all toddlers, he starts to misbehave.What follows is an 'Alien' copycat plot, except with even more generic characters, duller dialog and a total absence of original ideas. In a matter of hours, Calvin bulks up into a starfish-squid hybrid with the strength of a gorilla, the intelligence of a chess grand-master and the empathetic capacity of a cobra. Calvin's cuteness wears off fast, and the crew decide to neutralize him, but he demonstrates some impressive natural defenses and the ability to scamper about the station's exterior in a vacuum. After that, the hapless astronauts know they need to think out of the box if they want to avoid becoming Calvin's luncheon buffet.",1,32,61,2 April 2017
Annihilation," Annihilation of a Decent Idea
","A meteorite strikes a lighthouse on the southeastern US coast and a mysterious 'Shimmer Zone' begins expanding from the impact point. The government keeps the event a secret and sends military units into the area, but none of these personnel ever return. After about a year, the special forces husband of an ex-Army biologist called Lena suddenly shows up at their home, remembering little of the previous twelve months and immediately falling seriously ill.After this 15 minute prologue, Lena joins the next all-female expedition. The five women enter the zone, witness disturbing events and discover their communications devices no longer work. Rather than return to base and report these discoveries, they push on, arguing among themselves and making more foolish decisions until they resemble dim-witted teenagers in a slasher pic. The military and scientific background becomes increasingly unbelievable as routine action sequences and some uninspired CGI overwhelm the film's grown-up possibilities.Many sci-fi fans will recall JG Ballard conceived the original idea of an expanding zone where the laws of nature are transformed. By comparison to Ballard's 1966 novel 'The Crystal World', Garland's movie version of Jeff VanderMeer's copycat concept is a conventional adventure yarn spiced up with some sci-fi mumbo-jumbo. 'Annihilation' ends up as inconsequential as Garland's 2007 'Sunshine' screenplay - and after 'Ex Machina', it's a major disappointment.",1,586,1131,5 March 2018
Alien: Covenant," Gore and Boredom in Space
","By now, most movie fans will be familiar with the obligatory arc of an 'Alien' screenplay - a group of bungling space travelers encounter a vicious bloodthirsty alien who will dispatch most of them to gruesome deaths. In the old days, a resourceful female would battle the beast, but now the heroines are reduced to sniveling and screaming at it. 'Covenant' might be an improvement after the debacle of 'Prometheus', but it demonstrates yet again the creative bankruptcy of the 'Alien' series.The new film won't disappoint those with basement-level expectations. Its characters are slightly less irritating and better developed than the collection of nincompoops floundering around in the underground labyrinth of 'Prometheus - but the latest batch of victims make equally foolish choices whenever they're presented with a decision. Besides repeating plot ideas, the franchise now shamelessly recycles scenes and characters. Among many other old tropes, 'Covenant' revisits the treacherous android routine, and summons up another violent storm to isolate the unfortunate astronauts. The crew's grisly deaths come thick and fast, leaving little time to create the tension which made the original film so exceptional. Director Scott has lost any feel for this element as he hurries from one messy demise to the next, creating a conveyor belt of violence, panic and bloody entrails. The tale's major twist, which is also its feeble attempt at a deep philosophical idea, is just a pompous interlude before the mayhem resumes. When it's all over, the chief impression is of carnage and tedium.",1,11,20,3 June 2017
