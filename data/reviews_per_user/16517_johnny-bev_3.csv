Child 44," similar to citizen X!!!!!!
","Well as I was looking forward to this I thought I would review this as feature, i'll keep it short though and as I found this film heavily influenced on CITIZEN X filmed in the early 90's I still thoroughly enjoyed it but would state that is the worse of the two by a country mile and that it was less compelling and even swayed from the path of interest, all that said it is still a very decent film and captures the effect of the U.S.S.R. of that time period and the mindset surrounding it, but it should as the way has already been set for it!.As I have said previously I found the movie citizen x a much superior, better acted and more believable film and especially since it is based upon reality but then I'am just filling lines in here just to make IMDb happy in its minimum requirements.",Null,0,5,25 July 2015
The Witch," The most shocking thing here is the lack of shock!
","Well i'll try and keep it short, i was looking forward to this especially for the period setting and different take that was promised,the acting was good but sadly that was it as i found ye olde English tongue uncomfortably nauseating throughout the whole film, kinda like someone rushing to tell another person a crucial bit of information only to find out the person doing the talking has an extreme case of stuttering.The characters are yet again quite unlikeable ( understatement ) and the plot or story doesn't really do anything to entertain neither did it add much horror to the film which is the true shock here, what we really are treated to is religious types driving each other into the ground for the majority of the film.. in reality this is yet another attempt at being an art-house atmosphere type ( one of those! ) films.",4,3,7,20 April 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," Really!!!..for a movie on the road this doesn't seem to go anywhere!
","As said by some others this is a disappointment, it had the same vibe of disappointment as the two previous instalments but I found them more entertaining at least, the first mad max was a good film and by far the best of the series and this fails to bring any form of 'mad max' to life as throughout the film as tom hardy's ( good casting call ) mad max remained nothing but tame max at very best, I also felt that for something based in or around a large chase scene it didn't seem to go anywhere throughout, the movie it started well but stayed at the same pace throughout the film.To say i'am unimpressed is an understatement especially in this day and age especially with all the money that was put into this and the cast with what they had did play a good part....nothing special at all!",Null,28,56,26 June 2015
