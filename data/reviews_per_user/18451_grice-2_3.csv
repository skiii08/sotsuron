Requiem for a Dream," A Powerful film from a talented filmmaker
","Darren Aronofsky's frantic, music-video style of directing isn't particularly original - Danny Boyle, David Fincher, and Tom Tykwer all have made names for themselves with it within the last few years - but Aronofsky is really the first to use it to make a truly emotionally wrenching film. His stamp is on nearly every scene (incidentally, the little criticism this film has received is because of this), but rarely feels out of context.  It all adds to the power of the story, it all compliments the emotions and feelings the characters are going through.  This is why this is a great film.  The camera tricks and weird angles aren't 'cool' in 'Requiem for a Dream' like they are in 'Trainspotting' or 'Run Lola Run' - they're just disturbing.  Which is exactly what they're supposed to be.If 'Requiem' falls short anywhere, its thematically.  This is a film about addiction, desperation, loneliness, and the loss of hope, with drug abuse as the vehicle.  So on the surface, you have this immensely bleak picture of 4 people abusing drugs with very little if any insight into why these people ever started in the first place, any insight into the pleasure of it. Consequently, the film almost comes off as unintentionally preachy.  I have no doubts that this was intended as a film about giving up hope and the drug abuse was merely incidental, but I can't help but wonder if the theme would've come across a little better if a different vehicle for the characters' demise had been chosen.",Null,0,0,30 October 2000
American Beauty," Even worse the second time around...
","For obvious reasons, I don't make it a habit to see twice a movie I loathe the first time.  With 'American Beauty', I made an exception - something so universally praised has to have some redeeming qualities, right?Well, not really.Kevin Spacey's performance is good.  Of all the statuettes scooped up by the film, his was probably the most well-deserved.  His character was the most fleshed-out (which, in this film, is saying VERY little), and he showed us Lester from every angle.  He made a man contemplating statutory rape seem sympathetic and even downright likable, and that is certainly worthy of praise.Unfortunately the rest of the cast does not fare so well.  I personally believe this is less to do with the skill of the actors than with the horrible, birdcage-liner of a script, although I'm open to arguments otherwise.  Annette Bening flails her way through the film until she's virtually unwatchable, Thora Birch plays a to-the-letter stereotype of the sullen teen, and Wes Bentley plays the eccentric artiste.  Mena Suvari is probably the strongest of the younger cast, playing on her sexuality while showing enough restraint (which is in short supply in this film) to avoid turning into the sexpot cheerleader cliche.The tagline is perhaps the most abhorrent thing about this film.  'Look Closer'.  In a film as shallow as this, where the idea of materialism and career being secondary to love of family is actually presented, in all seriousness, as a revelation, the idea of 'Looking Closer' is downright pretentious.  If 'The Jerry Springer Show' decided to use it as their new tagline, is it not still just a show about adulterous trailer-dwellers and midgets with odd sexual fetishes?  Methinks it is.This isn't an unappreciable film.  All things said, its actually wholly entertaining, but the problem is, its a film that thinks its something its not.  This is whats known as a Popcorn Movie.  Like 'Pearl Harbor', like 'Con Air', 'Armageddon', this is a film simply to entertain.  It's mindless entertainment.  There isn't necessarily anything wrong with that - we all need that sometimes.  But there IS something wrong when such a film commands the Oscars and tops critics' lists almost universally - this means the REAL cerebral, important films are being ignored, or aren't getting the credit they deserve.",Null,0,0,30 August 2001
American Beauty," One of the most overrated movies in recent years.
","Every few years a film comes along that both critics and the moviegoing public just fall for completely and rakes in a ton of money...a few years ago it was 'Forrest Gump', now it's 'American Beauty'.'American Beauty' is art-house light, a film that was unquestionably crafted from the moment the first words of the script were typed to be an 'important' film.  Nothing was left out - you've got your drug use, homosexuality, infidelity, voyeurism - 'American Beauty' has got it all. It goes without saying to really explore each of these things with their relation to the human condition in *one* film would result in the longest movie since 'The Ten Commandments'.  So the makers of 'American Beauty' didn't even bother; its all there on the surface in the name of being provocative.Now thats only one problem with the film.  And it could be forgiven, assuming the movie was otherwise effective.  Unfortunately, the director of 'American Beauty' found it prudent to juxtapose Kevin Spacey's earnest voiceovers and Thora Birch's adolescent angst with hallucinatory interludes - the rose petals, the name in the lawn on fire.  As the movie progresses these scenes slowly sap whatever feeling of reality the film had to the point where it loses its punch entirely - to put it bluntly, the final scene could have been replaced in whole and replaced with Kevin Spacey waking up a from a dream, and the film wouldn't have missed a beat.",Null,0,0,30 October 2000
