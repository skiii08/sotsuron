The Avengers," One of the most overrated movies i've ever seen
","The Avengers represents everything that's bad in a hero movie. In my opinion, this movie should be nominated for one of the most disappointing movie of the year. The movie is not funny, barely action and has a terrible plot. the villain in the movie, Loki, was the most bad villain character in the history of movies and not in the good way. I hope for me and for everybody else that there will not be a sequel, because it will ruin everything that batman has built about a comics movie. I was merciful and gave it 3/10 because Robert Downey Jr. succeed to do something good in this movie, but for the rest of the cast, you owe me 2.5 hours from my life.",3,6,14,28 September 2012
