Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Sometimes one can get too excited
","This movie is not the worst in the history of theater. It isn't even the worst of 99. It is a decent movie that had to live up to the impossible dream of that which is the Star Wars Trilogy. So many people have grown up with those movies as a staple that it was almost destined that Episode 1 would disappoint. Not that Lucas helped himself with a certain CGI character named Jar Jar (shudder). But annoying sidekicks and bad child acting aside, this movie had some great moments. The pod race was excellent, albeit long, and the final battle soundly put all the others in the previous movies to shame. Ewan McGregor is an excellent actor who really did embody my vision of a young Obi-Wan. If only there had been more of him and less Jar Jar. I can't wait to see him more in the second and third movie. Natalie Portman too was a good choice, but under used. You hardly knew her, so you hardly cared. And let's face it, this part of the saga really isn't all that exciting, things don't really start moving until Anakin grows up. All in all, Lucas did make some blunders, but they could have been much worse, and I for one eagerly await the rest of the first trilogy.",Null,1,2,19 November 2001
"Monsters, Inc."," Wonderful
","This movie was absolutely wonderful! I was sort of dragged to it not knowing what to expect, but what I got was great. This is the perfect movie for anyone, and the animation is brilliant. You can actually see the individual hairs on the monsters moving in the wind! Good job Pixar, Star Wars couldn't have picked a better movie to run their first trailer in front of.",Null,0,1,19 November 2001
The Princess Bride," One of my favorites
","This movie is one of the best I've ever seen. I mean, somehow an entire fairy tale was pulled off without being campy or sugar coated. It works on so many levels, from adults with its humor to kids with its magical story. And Westley! Why can't there be more guys like that in the world?",Null,4,6,19 November 2001
