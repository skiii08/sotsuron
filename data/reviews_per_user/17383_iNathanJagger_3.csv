It," Perfect remake for the modern-age
","I watched the original but didn't take the notice I should of when watching to compare both movies, but then again I don't need to - this movie is its own perfect thing without being judged with the old TV Movie. It might be a remake (ish) but it is own thing completely, even though it's a remake! So watch this with or without the knowledge of the original. I originally thought they were going to show the young child being taken without any blood, but when watching it I thought it was setting the scene throughout the whole movie and showing the blood like they did was perfect, and kind of shockingly good, and the time they took on the same scene was amazingly longer than the last one. I loved how they showed each character ion their home place and struggles without having each person there to join along, because we needed to see them and how they react and work with their struggles after being through them for a while, and that is without pennywise being involved. Then bringing them all together to find out, 'wait we are going through the same thing'. This happens very shortly into the movie, sooner than I thought but made it fit in perfectly. And they gave them enough time to go through all the hard times as a group to break up and get back together to make it in good time for the end of the movie. And the ending wasn't fast, it had its own phase and took its time to make everything fit in and make sense, which makes sense it did perfectly. They also made it perfectly to put in - chapter 2, which the only thing you will wish for in chapter 2 is they explain where IT came from for this movie franchise and not go the extreme like the book/Stephen King does. As much as this is a remake they make it perfect for the 21 century so I hope they do the same thing with Pennywise's background but make it not too extreme and understandable",10,41,81,16 September 2017
Spider-Man: Homecoming," The smallest thing could have given it a 10
","As I have watched all Marvel movies and will continue to do so leading up to Infinity War, I had high expectations for this movie - especially as SpiderMan 4 was cancelled and The Amazing Spider-Man 3 for stupid reasons but also with stupid plots to come in the movie. So Spiderman: Homecoming was going to be a show stopper for me, and it was! The humour was unimaginably good with perfect timings and getting to know Peter and Ned and the bad guy with all their intentions and lead ups and awkward moments in the movies, with the ending being shocking up understandable. The only downside for me is that we didn't get to know his friends around him, we understood Ned and Liz but everyone else we didn't get to know like I feel like we should of, Michelle we got to know a bit about with her mind and understanding, being the one whose quietly clever and understanding smart with her sarcastic comment, but I would of mind knowing where she got that sense of humour from and what else is her link to Peter and Ned because all we know is she sat alone with no friends on the same Table as then (Happily). Now Flash, he isn't a flash - is a Flash who wants to be mean but doesn't know how to, I feel like was a weak way of putting him in the movie as they didn't know exactly what to do to him and how to make him the meanie we know him to be. We know flash as a bully who picks on Peter the most because he can and has no excuse not to, and Liz as she is the equivalent of Mary - her and Flash have no connection and no relationship, for the time they are together I don't think they spoke to each other, just was in the same conversation but with aiming their talking at each other. It seems like Flash is Flash in the movie is because Peter does what he wants and doesn't give a sh** and Flash is jealous of it and fails to be jealous on the outside and get put down like you think the school bully should but it's a movie - he should be the bully who doesn't get done. Flash was a missed opportunity in this movie and I hope he gets a backbone in the next one and I hope we learn more about his friends/group in the next movie. Now Aunt May Parker, she is the wrong actor to play with character, we know her as an old women who is on the breaking point every day but keeps with the backbone for Peter even when he lets her down, even if The Amazing Spider man was a weak excuse of a Spiderman movie she still did the part - where as this Aunt May was young hurt and seemed like she grew a bit older since Captain America: Civil War. When we saw her they were short and simple lines and at times getting hit on by some guys around, but when she was upset Peter had to say a few words to make the attention go to him crying. I feel like when she was shown it was an easy way of pumping the movie length a bit longer, except Peter crying scene, but that could have been done way better than done. I still to this day will say the original Spider man film with the classic characters and plots was the best one, but this film just shows in part what both Spider Man and The Amazing Spider Man did well, and it shocking as The Amazing Spider Man for me was a waste of money that earned money.",Null,1,7,26 August 2017
Baby Driver," One of the best movies of 2017
","This is a really amazingly original movie: it's surprising actually, at first glance you'd think this must just be a good movie that made it to the cinemas - but it's more than a good movie! It brings and original story based plot with a new concept to it, in my opinion using fast and furious' concept and putting it with a good old-fashioned plot of a boy who's hurt in some form or way and living life on the edge but keeps loved ones safe. But it comes close to an end, like a classics movie but putting the new base to it which works really well! And it suits the movie with its pace and way around the situation. Throughout the movie certain actions, he takes, comes back to do something for him later on. In the end, this movie is really good bring classics to new and mixing it to make the best out of it! From what I hear there are plans for a second movie - which will be met with open arms and smiles from me and much more!",10,11,19,9 July 2017
