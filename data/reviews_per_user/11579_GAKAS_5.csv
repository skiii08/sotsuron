The Hangover," Please tell me what all the fuss is about?????????
","After I saw this movie I rated it 2 out of 10. But after having a further think and discussion about it, I reduced my score to 1 out of 10. Why? This movie is stupid! Most of the time it doesn't make sense. A cop car that's stolen but there's no man hunt for it, a tiger in the bathroom but they're talking about it in the living room like they've had it happen to them previously. Meanwhile the nerdy guy is more scared of his fianc√© than the tiger! The hotel finds a bed thrown on a statue but assume it was thrown out of a window, even though they don't have windows?????? What the hell! The tiger is drugged and put into their car to take it back to Mikes place? Have you lifted a tiger lately?? I know they are trying to be funny, but they lost me from the beginning. By the time the photo's are shown at the end I was already over it. Not only that there are absolutely no consequences in the end for any of them. BOOOOOOORRRRIIIINNGGG! 'Yeah, lets high five each other' Amazing that Hollywood can produce this crap and promote it so hard, and still make huge dollars. In conclusion, rent Very bad things, now that's a Vegas movie. And if you don't get what's going on in that movie, like one person who called it an evil movie about a homicide........IT'S A BLACK COMEDY!!!",5,158,299,27 July 2009
City of God," Brilliant!! Brilliant!! Brilliant!!
","Go and get this movie. Put it in your collection. If you do not live in the 'City of God', you will thank your lucky stars that you were not born there after seeing this movie and make you appreciate what you have. I had been wanting to see this movie for a while and just never really sat down to give a chance. I knew it was made in 2002 and I was about to watch it in 2005 after so many people telling me it was a great movie. I didn't know anything about the plot so I had no idea what to expect either. To help me along I was longing to see a great movie in 2005. All I ask for is to see one outstanding film per year, and the others can be good or great. But I need to see one outstanding movie per year, and thats what I got in October 2005. The year is almost over and I was losing hope. Story 10/10, Directing 10/10, Movie as a whole 10/10. If you love movies, this is a movie yo must see before you die.",10,1,4,23 October 2005
The Departed," Martin Scorsese at his BEST!!
","Well I thought this movie was going to be OK, another typical mob movie........WRONG! This movie was unbelievable. All of the key actors were unbelievable. DiCaprio was brilliant. If this does not land him an Oscar then someone doesn't like him. I know it was a remake, but the delivery was the best Scorsese has brought to the cinema for a while. The classic Scorsese camera work was all over this movie. That's what I love about him, the angles no other director will experiment with. Oscar nominations for Scorsese, DiCaprio, Damon,......all of them!! that's my prediction. I can't believe it's opening weekend was slow. It's amazing how some other rubbish has made more money than a Scorsese masterpiece like this. Thanks Marty, been waiting a while.",10,0,1,12 October 2006
War of the Worlds," Absolute Trash!!
","It is beyond me how anyone gave this movie 10/10. My score of 1/10 was a little high because there are no half points. This movie is an embarrassment to the original film, Spielberg and Hollywood blockbusters. My points were for the effects only, I gave them 7/10, but then took away another six points for the worst plot I've ever seen. No spoiler alerts required, this plot is so predictable that every worst nightmare comes true, and yes, in true rubbish style, someone survives the impossible. The son shows up at the end. My comment half hour before that was...'the son better not show up at the end' I am such a fan of Spielberg, but Steven, this was bad, very bad!!",1,51,89,13 July 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant!!
","Well done George Lucas. The first movie I ever saw as a child was Star Wars, and after not being very thrilled with Attack of the Clones, this saga has now been put to rest beautifully. I know there are people who comment on the acting being soft at times but thats what its all about. The acting in A New Hope wasn't anything to give awards to either. What ever the acting may be, what about the transformation of this weak young man into an evil lord. This doesn't happen because of power, it happens because of weakness. Brilliant! This movie is a must see for everyone. Even if you are not a big Star Wars fan, the production and effects in this movie are unlike anything you've seen before. The operatic climax was wonderful. Bravo! 10 out of 10!",6,3,7,22 May 2005
