Blade Runner 2049," everything a sequel should be.
","Given Ridley Scots recent work Alien Covernent, I was highly skeptical of this film. However his role in this film was limited and I'm so glad it was, as the script, cast, story line, cinematography and acting was all spot! The film is set in the near future of the original and expands on the original story line.The style and pacing of the film matches the first and improved CGI and a higher budget really allowed them to go all out and create some stunning visuals.I don't think I've ever said this about a sequel (perhaps excluding Aliens by James Cameron) but, if you're a fan of the original, I highly recommend you give this film a go.",9,3,11,18 October 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Explosions and great action scenes, but void of any story
","This film had a lot of potential. The characters they chose were quite iconic and had a lot of scope for character development.Instead we just got action scene, after action scene with absolutely no back stories to any of the characters. Such a shame as developing characters like the blind jedi could have really added depth to the film. Instead of any dialogue, flash back or anything to help develop the character, we get 'oh, he's just a blind jedi' and that's it. Move on to the next character.The target audience for this film seems to be gold fish. Or any viewer who's memory can't last more than 5 minutes.Any minor plot in this film had to be repeated by different characters every few minutes in case we had forgotten.Such a shame that this film favoured action over substance. I really hope future star wars film return to the focus of story telling as opposed to fitting as many action scenes as possible.",3,19,37,19 December 2016
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Confusing and dull
",I get the impression this film was written by multiple writers - many of whom have not seen star wars. A confusing and pointless mix of scenes written purely for visual effect but lack any sence or reason.,1,12,19,23 December 2019
Jurassic World," Absolutely ridiculous. Complete nonsense.
","Premise of the film is as follows. I'm not joking it's actually true....Finally they've made a successful Jurassic Park tourist attraction. However the military secretly get involved behind the scenes as ask the park to create a brand new highly intelligent invisible and bullet proof dinosaur. Yes you read that right... a highly intelligent invisible and bullet proof dinosaur.......A invisible bullet proof dinosaur....Which without ever having interacted with humans knows how they think and how to trick them.Of course the dinosaur escapes and begins to kill everything. No one ever stops to ask what other dinosaur species made up this genetic hybrid... They have to find that out the hard way, bit by bit, when a simple phone call would of helped them massively.This is all happening whilst the 2 main terribly acted kids think it's a good idea to ditch their guardian and go off track into the middle of a dinosaur infested island... alone.Mean while the park ranger teams up with the raptors to go hunt the dinosaur. But that doesn't work because... the invisible bullet proof dinosaur can speak dinosaur... so he talks to the raptors and convinces them to turn on their human leaders.Obviously the next step is to get the T-Rex to help the humans. Luckily this lady with a high heels and a flare can out run the T- Rex let it chase her.. plus the invisible dinosaur can't speak T- Rex... so her plan works.I just can't understand how films like this get made without consulting experts to see if the ideas are actually feasible.They had a HUGE budget, a HUGE fan base ready to see the film... and they churn out this rubbish.Why not consult a dinosaur expert when writing a script that revolves entirely around dinosaurs?",1,90,163,16 June 2015
Lucy," Luc Besson.. Why?!! I expected this from others but not from you!
","Luc Besson, you really let me down!I've been a huge fan of his past films. Leon, Fifth Element, Nikita, Unleashed, Taken, etc etc etcThe trailer to the film made it look like standard epic Luc Besson film. However it seems he clearly failed his basic science education at school.There so so much wrong with the science in the film, and I'm no scientist! I enjoy reading about science and have retained much of my science education from school and right from the start when it was mentioned 'what if you could use more than 10% of your brain?' .. I assumed that would get corrected a few moments later... not be the premise and explanation for all of Lucy's abilities.Luc Besson seems to think having higher brain functionality allow you to time travel?To be clear. The whole '10% of your brain' argument has been refuted many times and is decades old. 12 years ago when I was at school we were taught how this statement was total BS. Seems Luc Besson didn't get the memo and no one thought to tell him before he started the film.None of the characters have any depth either. Morgan Freeman is... Morgan Freeman, standard 'I speak slowly and deeply which means anything I say appears profound'. Scarlet Johansons does nothing to make anyone connect with her character.The drug they are transporting at it's current state would be legal... So why did they went to the effort of kidnapping I have no idea. Fedex would of been much cheaper.This film is NOT for: People with basic science education People with common sense",1,405,793,22 September 2014
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Remake of Episode IV
","It would of been nice if it was advertised correctly, as a remake of the original Star Wars film. But I guess they wouldn't of made as much money that way?It's essentially a more child/teen friendly version of A New Hope.It's exactly the same story and character types, but with cheap attempts at humor and instead of a badass bad guy (darth vader) you get a bratty kid who has temper tantrums (kylo ren).It bought nothing new to the table and didn't progress the story in any way.We still have no idea what the main characters have been doing the last 20 years.",1,102,167,24 December 2015
