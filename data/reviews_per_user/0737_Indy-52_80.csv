The Rock," action packed!
","i saw this movie in the cinema almost four years ago, and i loved it. I didn't really follow the story (i was 10), but i really enjoyed it nevertheless. I saw it recently again on television and i loved it even more. I can easily state that this is my all-time favourite action movie. I just love the car chase scene, it was so awesome, and so were all the other action scenes. No other action movie is so purely ACTION! But what makes it stand out are the brilliant performances by Sean Connery, Nicolas Cage, and Ed Harris. Everyone is so perfect in their role and they're all having fun! I'm happy this movie is woman-free, Ã§ause they just don't belong in these kind of movies. It's really a tough man's movie, i love it!Check this movie out now! Michael Bay's best movie, forget Armageddon.",Null,1,1,26 May 2000
The Devil's Advocate," excellent
","Introduction: The Devil's Advocate is an excellent horror film about a young successful lawyer who has never lost a case. Even when he knows his client is guilty, he always manages to turn things around so that it seems he is innocent. That makes him a good lawyer, but a bad person. When Kevin is offered a job at the world's best known law firm, he moves with his wife to New York. There he proves his reputation as reckless lawyer, but his success has a price. From the moment he meets John Milton, the head of the law firm, strange things happen to him and his wife. Their life slowly changes into a living hell.Comment: this is, in my opinion a very controversial film. There will be some who will love it, and some who'll hate it. I belong to those who love it. Many people will find this hard to watch entirely, because of the amount of gore and nudity. Also, the movie is mean-spirited as a whole, some of the things people do in this film are simply very bad. However, viewers who understand that this is a movie about the devil, which means there will be some gory parts and sexuality, will love this movie. It is a very twisted and scary film, that not everyone will enjoy. But it's a thrilling and emotional roller coaster ride from beginning to end. I recommend it to horror fans.",8,1,2,4 March 2000
The Blair Witch Project," sickening
","this headache-inducing movie is boring, un-scary, badly acted & badly filmed. Did i say movie? I take that back. I'm sorry, but i just can't call THIS a movie. There was no talent in making this. The writing sucks, cinematography is nauseating, and the actors were really amateurs. All they do is repeat the F-word 10 times in each sentence. The plot made no sense at all, none of the weird events are ever explained, and the way this movie ended really made me angry. It made no sense and it came too quickly. At the end the characters finally DO something, and then the movie finishes. What a rip-off! A lot of people went to see this movie in America and they all paid perfectly good money to see it. And this is what they got? I really feel sorry for them. They were robbed by two inept amateurish filmmakers. I'm happy i've seen it on DVD. At least i paid less.One last thing: i just hate that stupid 'documentary'! It tries to convince you that it's all real, while it's just a movie and all the interviewees are actors. Everything they said was lies. And that just disgusted me, because you expect facts from a Documentary, not lies.",Null,1,2,2 June 2000
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," stop whining about this movie!
","I think you people should really stop commenting on this movie. I know it was bad, I almost cried too when I came out of the theatre! But it's been almost two years since George tricked us into the theatres and made gazillions of $$$$$$$ with this sorry piece of crap! Get over it, please! Don't you have something better to do?I'll say it for the very last time now: THE PHANTOM MENACE IS A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT AND DOESN'T COME CLOSE TO MATCHING THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL TRILOGY!

Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," they just don't make them like they used to
","last year's THE PHANTOM MENACE was the ultimate proof that they can't make action/adventure films like they used. The 80's were truly the golden age for these movies (think RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK and sequels, THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, RETURN OF THE JEDI, ROMANCING THE STONE). What made the original star wars films so appealing were great characters, great action, and great humor. They were simply great! But this one fails completely at everything. The characters never smile even once (except for that horribly forced smile on Amidala's face at the end), the story is boring and the action is unexciting. THE PHANTOM MENACE can't be called a bad movie, though. I guess it can be pretty good if you expect the worst or have never seen the star wars films. But anyone who has seen them is bound to be disappointed.",8,0,1,9 December 2000
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," amazing sci-fi adventure
","i, like many other people, was looking forward to seeing this movie like hell. If i had to wait one day more to see it, i would have gone crazy. And, when i finally saw it, i wasn't just one bit disappointed. I'm a Star Wars fan, but not the die-hard type, and i thought it was as good as the other films. This movie had a good plot (better than that of the other movies, if you ask me), it had great action and great sword fights (i won't mention the special effects, everyone knows they're great by now). I only wished there were more humor and chemistry between the main characters. Anyway, the action made me forget the movie's flaws.

Raiders of the Lost Ark," THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE...
","...and don't let anyone tell you indy-lovers differently. This is simply THE action-adventure flick of all time. Anyone who hasn't seen it yet, see it now or you'll miss a piece of film history. This motion picture is perfect to the very last detail: the cast is great, the action is unlike anything you've ever seen, the direction is fantastic and the acting is unusually good. Harrison Ford deserved the oscar, i'm dead serious: the way he portrays Indy is inimitable. He realizes he is playing a human being, not some kind of super hero. The acting by Karen Allen is also excellent, Marion is Indy's best love interest ever. The nazi guy with that huge forehead and those creepy glasses was also great. This is the most unbelievable motion picture in all of film history: it is so insanely entertaining, the action just never lets up! Certainly the film does take its time to calm down and display some humor and romance, but before you know it, you're just thrown back into the action. Who could forget such memorable action scenes, like the rolling bowl scene at the beginning, the one with the snakes, when he almost destroys a city with a truck, the final scene with all the ghosts and goblins... all these scenes are unforgettable. This is the kind of movie you can watch over and over and never get tired of it. I have it taped since i was four and i wouldn't dream of deleting it. Deleting Raiders is like deleting a part of my life. Oh, i wish i could've seen this movie in the theatre in 1981, but i wasn't even born yet. And the saddest thing is they don't make any more indy films today. And even if that will happen some day, they won't have harrison ford to play him, which would really spoil the whole movie for me.
They really don't make'em like this anymore.",10,0,0,1 March 2000
Raiders of the Lost Ark," the best film made in the history of motion pictures!
","2001 marks this legendary, innovative adventure yarn's 20th birthday, and since it is also my #1 favorite movie of all time, I decided it was time for me to write a review of it. This is Steven Spielberg and Harrison Ford at their absolute best. Practically every action set piece in this film has gone down in movie history, just like the rousing, incredible score by the great John Williams (JAWS, STAR WARS, E.T., CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND... he's done 'em all!). By the way, I'm not getting paid to write this review, since no one really needs another. I'm writing it simply to express my immense affection and love for it.This is the true, great roller coaster ride that STAR WARS simply wasn't for me at the time. Harrison Ford, already a star after playing Han Solo, fares considerably better in this role. In fact, this could be the best-cast part that any actor has ever been in, in any movie. If you could say 'born-to-play-this role' about just one role, it would be Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones. Thank God for Magnum P.I., otherwise Tom Selleck would have taken the role in all the movies (honestly, I think he would've been okay, but it would now be unthinkable to picture anyone but Ford as Indy). The story of the film doesn't have a lot of developments or twists, it's just a roller coaster ride of a movie that never lets up. It would be hard to say that the first, introductory sequence is the best, since there's so much more that the movie offers, but I think it's the best-known to casual moviegoers. It's the one where we first meet one of the all-time greatest screen heroes that is, of course, Indiana Jones. The year is 1936 and we're somewhere in a South American forest. Indy is looking for a gold statue and although he will find it he will get very near to being killed in the process... only to see it being taken away by his arch-enemy called Rene Belloq, played blandly by Paul Freeman. This is the famous sequence where he escapes from a giant boulder, where he finds a miriad of tarantulas on his back, and where picks up the gold statue from the standard carefully but causes the cavern to collapse. After this sensational opening sequence the film slows down a while to show us that Jones also works as professor in college. He is contacted by his superiors and is sent on a mission to find the Ark of the Covenant, an important artifact where Mozes wrote the ten commandments, before the Nazis do (how someone can work as a teacher and an adventurer is beyond belief, of course, but so are many aspects of this movie). He will travel to Cairo in Egypt, and that's where the majority of the movie takes place. On his way there, he goes to Nepal, where he needs to find another artifact that will help in his mission. It is owned by Marion (Karen Allen), an old girlfriend of his, and she initially refuses to hand it over. Soon later a group of Nazis, led by the very creepy Toht played by Ronald Lacey, break into her bar for that same necklace that Indy came for. Eventually the Nazis will cause a fire, fight with Indy and Marion (she's not your typical damsel in distress, she often helps Indy out and takes care of herself), and die under the fire, although Toht turns up again later in the movie. Once in Egypt, Indy and Marion will be thrown into one big action set piece after another. They will be pursued by swordsmen in the marketplace, thrown together in the snake pit where the Ark lies, destroy some Nazi airplanes with undescribable explosions, be engaged in a massive truck chase sequence, tied together with their eyes closed as God exacts his wrath on the Nazis at the film's effects-laden, spectacular climax.
This is truly one of those films that you enjoy so much that you don't even dare to think about something like plot inconsistencies. This wasn't an especially ambitious movie, it only wanted to thrill you, but it was so well made that it became a true movie classic. Part of what made it special was that it was a true labor of love, a happy collaboration between buddies Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, who co-wrote the story and executive produced. The fun they had really shines through: every set-piece is magnificently filmed and thought-up, with a real sense of fun, excitement, and awe that one just doesn't find anymore in contemporary action films. And who could forget that magical scene where we expect Indiana to start fighting a swordsman showing off his skills and he just shoots him? Another truly magical touch is the unforgettable music score. Who hasn't heard of the legendary 'Raiders March' theme? But that's just the half of the magic that Williams produces here. There is a truly awe-ispiring theme going on in the scene where Indy is underground in Egypt in the room that with the sunlights shows him the way to where the Ark is. It's an extremely effective theme that's also heard in the stunning climax.And of course there is Harrison Ford, who is so confident and simply perfect in his role he should've gotten an Oscar. Unlike many other actors playing heroes, he doesn't hit a single wrong note in his performance. He could never be replaced in that role, while Sean Connery as James Bond, for example, could. It is also clear to me now that a big part of the film's success has to be credited to Ford. And Spielberg was at the absolute top of his form by the time of this film (consider he was nominated for Best Director for this film and the next year for E.T. THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL), likewise with Lucas' creativity. John Williams has been Oscarnominated for practically every score he wrote since JAWS. After doing some brilliant work the year before with THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, he went on to write his best music ever for this film. All the best talents in Hollywood at the time collaborated in 1981 to make what I think could be considered the best film of all time. No other film in history has achieved the excitement, sense of wonder, and sheer brilliance of this one. It is the ultimate fun time at the movies, and you have missed out on a part of life if you haven't seen it. [PG]",10,0,0,18 November 2001
Raiders of the Lost Ark," The Ultimate Movie
","there is not much reason to picking this film apart or analyzing it. It is simply the greatest adventure spectacle ever filmed. Everyone knows that. To hell with Star Wars, that ultra-cheesy crap! RAIDERS is THE movie to see. It represents to foremost reason we go to see movies. No action film ever measured up to it. It is the one and only action-roller-coaster-ride. The sequels are both decent, but pale in comparison. If you're teenager or older and haven't seen this extraordinary flick, you've never really had a childhood.

Raiders of the Lost Ark," possibly the best film ever made
","In My humble opinion, Raiders of the Lost Ark ties Star Wars as the best movie of all time. If that doesn't give you a hint as to the contents of this review, nothing will. It's 1935, and Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is a professor of archaeology. Only, that's his day job. Jones is a globe hopper who has a unique talent for acquiring rare antiquities. Jones' talents come to the attention of U.S. Army intelligence, who just happen to require a little assistance. It seems that Adolf Hitler and his Nazis have set out to recover the long lost Ark of the Covenant. The Ark, according to the bible, was the container in which the Ten Commandments were housed. According to legend the Ark will bring incredible power to those who possess it. Jones, always up for a challenge, agrees to try to find the Ark before the Nazis do. I'm not going to bother giving a synopsis of the rest of the movie, because 99% of the people reading this review will already have seen the movie. As to the other 1%, trust me when I say that nothing I could write here would ever do this movie justice. Raiders is the classic action adventure, there has never been anything like it before, and nothing since has ever measured up to it. Including it's two sequels. Harrison Ford is perfect as the adventurer who completes his goals no matter what it takes. The rest on the supporting cast do a fantastic job, including John Rhys-Davies as Indiana's Egyptian connection Sallah and Paul Freeman as Beloq, the French archaeologist who heads up the Nazi team searching for the Ark. The only weakness in this movie comes from the casting of Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood, Jones' former flame and current partner in his quest for the Ark. Not that there is anything wrong with Allen's acting, I've just never felt that she was right for the part. Oh well, if that is my biggest complaint about a movie I'm doing OK. I could rave on and on about this movie for hours, but in the end I would probably be just preaching to the choir. If you are one of the very few people who have never seen this film, do yourself a favor and watch it. I guarantee you will not regret it. 10/10",10,0,0,10 February 2001
Minority Report," good movie but a bit disappointing
","After reading all those positive, nay, ecstatic reviews from top critics all over the world about this movie, being a big Spielberg fan (if not as big a Tom Cruise fan) I had to see what all the fuss was about. OK, although this movie isn't anywhere near bad, it wasn't nearly as original or as brilliant as many critics claimed. At certain times I felt really uneasy and depressed watching this movie, especially during the scenes with Peter Stormare, whose character is neither funny, nor scary, nor cynical, just plain unlikable in every way. Also the scene with the old woman explaining every detail of the plot in the middle of the movie was blatant exposition and it went on forever. The look of the movie is also extremely ugly at times. Why did it all have to look either blue or grey, why couldn't there be some life and color? I hate Spielberg's new cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, the only movies he shot well were Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan, and A.I. It baffles me how some people praise the shooting style of the film, and it's even more infuriating to realise that desaturating the color actually demanded a special process, and therefore money. With Private Ryan it worked well, but why the hell was it needed in this film? Sometimes I could barely tell what I was seeing. Now, I'll admit that was one of the few things that bothered me about the movie. The script is at times unpredictable and clever. The performances are all solid. The Cruiser isn't nearly as arrogant and annoying as usual, like he was in Vanilla Sky (awful movie). The effects are quite imaginative at times, although the ugly cinematography never really allows you to appreciate them (completely unlike in A.I.). Some of the direction is inspired, like when the spiders are searching the building, although mostly Spielberg's touch seems absent from the picture. You can tell by the film that there was nothing personal for him in the script; often the direction is flat and obvious. I think the best decision Spielberg could make now is to fire his cinematographer. I can't tell you how irritated I was by the lighting in certain scenes. Just get Dean Cundey back or something! It is truly, extremely ugly at times; it's almost like Kaminski was experimenting on how bad an effects-laden, expensive movie like this could possibly look, and I think he succeeded. I think he tried to do the same with The Lost World, but only with this film he succeeds in making it look ugly all the way through.Now, of course there is a lot to admire as well about the film. The most enjoyable scenes come near the end when we discover just how everything worked, who the real bad guy is, why Cruise was set up. It's handled with admirable clarity and cleverness. Also, at those rare times when the movie intends to be humorous, it succeeds. And of course, it's a lot of fun to see all those surprisingly realistic future gimmicks on the screen.
All in all, MR is better than 90% of this year's movies and it's Cruise's best performance since Magnolia. The story is original and complex but never incomprehensible. It's just that it doesn't compare to classic sci-fi movies like The Matrix, Terminator 2, or even Star Wars Episode 2 (although that opinion really is a minority report :-)). Some critics are saying it's better than those films, but trust me that's not true. Among Spielberg's movies I would say it ranks about in the same league as A.I. and Saving Private Ryan (both of which were good but not great movies in my opinion).",Null,0,0,19 October 2002
Unbreakable," an excellent film...
","bottom line with this film, you'll either love or hate it. Or: you'll either 'get' it or you won't. You might like it the second time you watch it, as I did. The movie might seem boring at first, but when you think about it you find out it's a pretty intelligent film. It's never really suspenseful, although for a few moments it is exciting when we see David fighting with a drunk lunatic. There is little dialogue in it, and not much happens in the story. It's hard to describe. You'll probably be engrossed and fascinated by the story, even though it's quite slow-moving. It is a sad film: there is no comic relief at any time. If you liked the sixth sense, you might like it, or might not. Watch it and judge for yourself. But it certainly a very good film: that much cannot be denied.",8,0,0,6 October 2001
Unbreakable," M. Night Shyamalan proves he's truly Unbreakable
","Last year, M. Night Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense took the country by surprise when its twist ending shocked audiences across the nation, introduced us to the exceptional talent of the young Haley Joel Osment, received 6 Academy Award nominations, and went on to become one of the highest grossing films of all time. Since the announcement of Shyamalan's follow up to Sense, Unbreakable, the country has been asking the questions-'Will Shyamalan deliver again? Will he be able to top The Sixth Sense? Can he create an ending more shocking than Sense's?' The answer to all three of these questions can now be told: The answer is yes-and with flying colors. A chilling masterpiece of the unexpected and the supernatural, Unbreakable, unlike Sense, will divide critics and audiences alike, but its imagination and ambition is what propels it past the quality level of The Sixth Sense.
Bruce Willis (who also starred in Sense) is wonderfully subtle as David Dunne, who, after miraculously being the lone survivor in a train crash, begins coming to strange realizations after a strange note is left on his windshield; He cannot recall a time when he was sick nor injured - somewhat strange for a grown man, eh? Dunne searches for the identity behind the eerie note he received, and is lead to Limited Edition, a comic-book art gallery, owned by the mysterious Elijah Price (an afro-sporting Samuel L. Jackson). Price offers an unrealistic, far-fetched explanation for Dunne surviving the crash and never being sick: David Dunne is unbreakable, his bones do not break. His cells react to bacteria and sickness in a different way than anyone else. Price on the other hand, is on the opposite end of the spectrum. Ever since birth, Price's bones have broken effortlessly. Price relates these two characteristics to that of comic book characters, as Dunne is just first discovering his 'trademark', or his special powers as a super-hero.Shyamalan knows audiences are coming into Unbreakable expecting a conventional tale of the supernatural; He knows audiences want a twist ending that will leave them breathless; He knows audiences want a film that will send them back into the theater several hours later to re-watch the film's twists which are reflected in the ending. And what does he do with this knowledge? He, quite frankly, slams it in the viewer's face and laughs at you for it. Unbreakable will undoubtedly leave audiences disappointed, leaving them asking 'What was that all about?' and most likely stating what a 'rip-off' it is. Shyamalan knows this. Shyamalan has not made Unbreakable for the mainstream audiences, he has made it for his personal satisfaction, a tribute to comic books. He has made a film that proves a film's advertising campaign does not necessarily reflect the film's true intentions or theme. And ultimately, he has made a film that tells the audience to not walk into his films with any expectations whatsoever, or he will, as seen with Unbreakable, slam them in your face. (And then laugh at you for it.)Certainly not a rehash of The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable succeeds in a way like no other film this year has for one reason: It does not care how the mainstream will react to it. Shyamalan crafts Unbreakable in a way that the viewer is truly unclear of what they're watching-is this a supernatural thriller with a twist ending, or is it a comic-book adventure tale? The answer is not revealed until the film's final revelation, which will leave some with smiles spread wide across their faces, and will leave others scoffing in disbelief and disgust. But either way the ball bounces, Unbreakable is still a daring, unconventional piece of cinematic art. When the credits began to roll, I could only think about one thing: The sequel.",8,0,0,25 February 2001
Memento," disappointing *****POSSIBLE SPOILERS!*****
","this movie is simply a big cheat. Yes, you heard me. The #10 position in the all-time list is a joke, and it proves that just because a movie has an unusual narrative style, people are always going to give it 10s. There has to be a good story. Not that MEMENTO has a bad story, it's just that it cheats in the end. The entire film, I'm wondering and hoping this character will find his wife's murderer, I'm accepting the storytelling style... and in the end the movie falls flat on its face. What happened to Carrie-Anne Moss? There is no resolution for this character, who is obviously meant to be important for the film. And what was with the 'Sammy' subplot? Like much else in the film, it doesn't serve much purpose or lead anywhere. Also the black and white scenes are pointless and confusing as hell. In what space in time do they occur? The present, the past? The future, maybe? But maybe I should just watch the movie again. I still recommend it though, if you wanna see something intriguing.",8,0,1,28 December 2001
The 13th Warrior," ok for mindless entertainment, but...
","...ultimately, this movie falls flat. This movie desperately wants to be a blockbuster, but the story is too conventional and the movie even gets boring at times. And that you would not expect with a movie that is directed by John McTiernan, and from its premise. From the beginning of the film, you start feeling there's something wrong about it. Antonio's narrating moves too fast, and before you know it, you're thrown into the action and you feel as if you've missed something. Therefore, the story is very vague and predictable, and it seems the director doesn't know exactly what he's doing, as if he's sleepwalking. By the time this movie reaches the end and you leave the theater, you have already forgot what the movie was about, and that's because the story isn't well told. And if a story doesn't flow, it easily becomes boring. Maybe the editor is the one to blame, but i believe the director's hart didn't go into the making of this film. 'The 13th Warrior' is definitely John McTiernan's worst film.",Null,0,0,2 April 2000
Batman Returns," the best Batman movie

It's shown in a comic book-style even more than the first one. It is much more violent than the first one, and after this one, this series turned into a kiddie television series.

The Penguin is a bit less fun a villain than the Joker (who wouldn't enjoy watching Jack Nicholson acting like a nut and having a ball collecting the hugest actor paycheck of all time?). There is almost nothing I can actually say in favor of this film, except that I liked it and enjoyed it.

","this movie could've been much better without all the nasty decapitations. This could even have been a good family movie, but no, they had to throw in all the ketchup to scare us. Well, it didn't scare me, it disgusted me.Aside from the excessive amount of blood, this horror film is not bad. Some scenes really are frightening, like when he finds all those heads in the tree and when he meets the dead sister. What sort of disturbed me was the romance between him and the girl, it was really boring and very clichÃÂ©. What i did like about it (the movie), was that it was very unpredictable, i could never guess what would happen next. Sometimes Danny Elfman's score was too loud, especially in the opening credits. It almost deafened me! Cinematography was very good, great costumes, great overall look.
If you like these kinds of stories, i guess it's worth seeing, but you have to know a little bit what it's about, or you'll be confused!(one more complaint: the ending was too exaggerated and farfetched when compared to the rest of the movie)",8,0,0,17 April 2000
Sleepy Hollow," I have a few problems with this film
","although the film has basically a good story and some great visuals, its narrative style can be quite confusing at times. At the end, I was confused about more than a few things. The story isn't told in a very clear way. Ichabod's weird dreams distracted me from the story. I also didn't like the way the Horseman was turned into a sort of henchman. Who really cares about who is 'controlling' him? This wasn't supposed to be a detective story, I think. I don't mind a bit of plot in my horror films, but here is an exceptional case where we don't care who the killer, and it doesn't really matter either. And what's with the mistreatment of animals and children? What was the point of the lady cutting off the bat's head and pouring its blood in a boiler? Or the cutting of the crow's leg by Katrina? There are several things about this movie I will never understand (I've watched it about five times). How come so much damn blood comes out of the dead widow's body, for instance? And what was the point of the evil eye business? And why does everyone always say 'pardon my intrusion' (it's said about four times in the film). Why did the Horseman's axe 'melt' in front of the church? Almost everything that happens in this movie is weird. Much of it probably doesn't even make sense. This is one of the most infuriating movies I've ever seen. But the blame isn't on the director, who does the best possible job of bringing the incohesive script to the screen. It is obviously to be placed on the screenwriter and the editor, who seem unable to create and understandable narrative. Still, with all these flaws, there is also much to admire in the film. Johnny Depp is a pleasure to watch, and young Marc Pickering makes an impressive debut as the poor young Masbath. It is also a very imaginative film, with director Tim Burton continuing to show his talent and originality, but next time he should pick a better script. However, I am eager to see his remake of Planet of the Apes, due out this summer!",8,0,1,3 July 2001
Sleepy Hollow," wow!
","I left this movie floored, stunned, amazed! The movie was incredibly entertaining, suspenseful, and beautiful to look at! I loved the performances, the dialogue, the plot, everything!

Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," my personal favorite
","i agree that this episode may be the weakest for true SW fans, but i still consider it the most enjoyable one. It's the only one that really never gets boring, while the other ones were. It's the only one that has a really good, emotional sword fight. The only thing that disappointed me was that there was again a Death Star to destroy, and the Ewoks were indeed annoying. The special effects are definitely improved, and the very last scene on Endor was very well made and it gave you that heart warming feeling that everything turned out ok.",8,0,1,7 November 1999
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," RATING (0 TO ****): ***1/2
","RETURN OF THE JEDI (1983) features the same old cast as the first two STAR WARS episodes in a rehash of previous themes. Now with a cast this talented and material this strong, rehashing is not necessarily bad. This time the Galactic Empire's forces lead by Lord Darth Vader (David Prowse acting with James Earl Jones's voice) has again build a Death Star and is still out to destroy the Rebel Alliance. This Death Star is, of course, even more powerful than the previous one and has the Emperor (Ian McDiarmid) personally supervising its construction.You may remember from the last episode that Han Solo (Harrison Ford) owed Jabba the Hutt (Mike Edmonds) money so Jabba in a fit of rage had him frozen and sent to Jabba's planet. The film starts with the rescue of Han from Jabba by Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), R2-D2 (Kenny Baker), and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew). The rest of the movie is ostensibly about the destruction of the Death Star by the rebels, but actually the film is about the inherit conflict in the duality of man and the thin line between good and evil. Will Darth Vader turn Luke to the dark side or will Luke turn Darth Vader to the good? Each is confident, and until the end it is not clear whose power will prove stronger.The character creations in all the STAR WARS series are delightfully imaginative. Jabba and his minions are testaments to the grotesque and the obese. After being grossed out by Jabba's huge rolls of jelly like fat, I suspect a large number of people must have run out of the theater to hit the pay phones to call 1-800-OutFat or some such number. A better advertisement for fat clinics I have not seen. By the way, I thought one of Jabba's entourage was at least a kissing cousin to the gargoyles that populate the movie GREMLINS.Yoda (Frank Oz) appears again in the show to complete Luke's training as aJedi. Luke thinks he is already one, but Yoda admonishes him, 'Not yet. One thing remains. One things remains, Vader. You must confront Vader, and then a Jedi you will be.' I love the flowery language the writers (Lawrence Kasdan and George Lucas) give Yoda. Yoda poetically warns Luke, 'Anger, fear, depression. The dark side are they.' Luke's training also needs help from his old mentor Obi-Wan (Alec Guinness). He appears in a vision telling Luke, 'You will find that many of the truths we cling to depend upon your point of view.' This is a show of secrets revealed, but you will not find them out here. See the movie.The sets (Norman Reynolds) and visual effects (Richard Edlund, Dennis Muren, and Ken Ralston) are even more elaborate than in the first two episodes. My favorite is the little hover-bikes on which they go screaming through the California redwood trees. That they could control the bikes while traveling at the high speed they are going makes no sense, but hey, this is science fiction afterall. The special effects continue to be a great blend of the old and the new: bows and arrows vs. blasters (laser guns) and hang gliders vs. large mechanical dinosaurs outfitted with laser cannons.RETURN OF THE JEDI introduces sweet furry new creatures called Ewoks. They were a hit at the time, but I am surprised there wasn't at even a bigger marketing tie in with them. Looked like great toys for the age 2-9 set to me.The acting in the movie was good. My favorite was James Earl Jones. His voice must be the richest and most powerful of any actor living today. Hamill, whom I found to be a big disappointment in the last episode, has more energy and does his part less on autopilot in this one. His performance here still pales in significance to his work in STAR WARS, which is the only film he has ever been great in.Although the show was excellent, there were several letdowns for me. First and foremost, I missed the incredible humor from the first two. There are laughs in RETURN OF THE JEDI, but overall the writers and the director (Richard Marquand) approach the show too reverentially. Second, I missed the romantic angle. There was some aspects of it in this episode, but not much.",8,0,1,7 February 2001
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," the BEST!!!
","the last episode of the star wars saga is the most spectacular and most enjoyable of the series. True, it's not as inventive or as original as the first two films, but the STAR WARS was just too hokey and hard to enjoy when you watch it today, and THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK was way too dark and sometimes even boring. This one has the best action and leaves you with a satisfied feeling unlike EMPIRE. This is one of the best sci-fi fantasy films ever made, and extremely enjoyable to watch.",8,0,1,28 November 2000
Alien," what are you talking about?!?
","this movie was terrible, simply terrible! It was absolute torture to look at: people say it's scary, but i call it disgusting. Also, the film didn't have a plot! It was just about an alien that sneaks into a spacecraft and haunts people: seen it! Those persons in that shuttle didn't look like astronauts at all: they just looked like they were in the wrong spot. The film was incredibly boring, too: and when it started 'moving along' it just was all about gore and slime in stomach-torturing scenes . Now that's not what i call 'scary'. This movie doesn't even deserve ONE star.",7,2,4,3 September 1999
Alien," one of the best old scary movies
","there were many scary movies made in the seventies that today are considered classics (e.g. Jaws, Halloween, Piranha, and ripoffs & sequels). Unfortunately i wasn't born in that decade, so i couldn't see anyone of these movies, i've only seen them on the small screen. One of my favorite movies of all time was Jaws, and i still think that that movie deserves the title of 'best scary movie of the 70's'. But, after lately seeing Alien, which many people have told me was a good movie, i think it is a good runner-up. I actually had seen Aliens, the sequel first, which was good. Although, after seeing this one, that movie looks much worse. While Aliens was okay, good, Alien is excellent, great! I know that many people think exactly the opposite, but these people are definitely wrong. It also shows because Alien is actually listed higher in the top 250. Alien was definitely scarier, while Aliens is more of an action/war flick. It was also far too loud and dumb and the action would often get boring. This never gets boring, even if there are scenes where nothing happens. It has great music and excellent set design, it really doesn't look old. I really understand why they call it a masterpiece!",7,0,1,22 February 2000
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," darn it! It's going down
","Contains spoilersI can tell you this with absolute certainty: Attack of the Clones will be out of this site's top 250 list in a few weeks. It falls about five places back each day, it is inevitable. That's too bad, because it deserves better. It deserves better than to eventually carry the same rating as The Phantom Menace, and better than being considered inferior to Return of the Jedi. I thought this was one of the most exciting, well-crafted, and entertaining space/adventure movies I'd ever seen, and I've seen every Star Wars movie. Certainly this movie has the best action scenes in the series, not only the best special effects, but the most awesome, exhilarating and adrenaline-pumping sequences I've ever seen. I've simply never seen anything as elaborate and ambitious as the chase through the Coruscant skies, the awesome chase through the meteors that makes the one in Empire Strikes Back pale, the very amusing and exciting action sequence at the Geonosis droid factory with 3PO, Anakin and Amidala, and of course the epic final arena battle. I also immensely enjoyed Obi-Wan's investigation in the library, to Yoda while he's teaching the Jedi 'younglings'  (GREAT idea, mr. Lucas), at his sleazy restaurant owner friend Dex and his visit to the eye-popping clone factory on Kamino. Obi-Wan really seems like another person in this film: in Episode 1 he seemed inexperienced, awkward, and insecure; in this film he's confident, cool, mature, and obviously more experienced. I also liked the development of Amidala: she gets to be more human and spontaneous in this film, she gets to look sexy and kick some ass, and... she gets to giggle and fumble with Anakin's attempts at courting and corny declarations of love. I think the worst scene in the movie is the one at the fireplace: there's times where their romantic tumfoolery scenes work and are touching, but when they get too serious, it absolutely falls apart and it's nowhere more obvious than in that scene. But almost every other scene works, and works really well. There are some really interesting scenes in the movie that connect it with events in the original trilogy, that almost weren't there in Phantom. Take my favorite moment for example, the brief allusion by the arachnid-like Geonosians to the Death Star; or the introduction of the Larses, Luke Skywalker's future foster family; or that great final scene where we see the clones in action, and they look just like the stormtroopers; or another great moment, when Boba Fett sees his dad Jango getting killed by a Jedi and we understand where the character's hatred of Jedi in the originals comes from; the ominous Darth Vader music that comes on whenever Anakin starts getting aggressive. This is really one of those movies where with each viewing you discover new links and connections with the earlier films, and I really believe this is the most plot-centred and complex of all the Star Wars films yet. I really loved this movie, and it's easily one of the three best Star Wars movies ever made. You've probably already seen it, so if you didn't like it I can only feel sorry for you that you're unable to just sit back and enjoy such an amazing ride.",9,0,2,11 June 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," an immense sci-fi epic! Best since THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK!
","ATTACK OF THE CLONES is a hugely entertaining sci-fi adventure that's definitely a lot more fun than THE PHANTOM MENACE. Anyone who doesn't like it doesn't know what it means to have fun. The movie ain't perfect, the performance from the guy who played Anakin is amateurish and his love scenes with Amidala are something you can only suffer through. All he has is good looks. I really hope he improves his acting before Episode III. But, everything else about this movie is spectatular! The action is amazing, mind-blowing, and so are the effects! It really doesn't show it was shot on digital video. The chase in Coruscant, the clone factory, and the final battle are really the most ambitious and amazing sequences I've ever seen in an action movie. I'm a big STAR WARS fan and I wasn't disappointed, unlike with THE PHANTOM MENACE. Go see it now!!!",9,0,2,20 May 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," I liked this movie a good deal, but here's a list of things that bothered me: ***SPOILERS***
","<ul><li>ALL comic relief moments, which were few, were unable to get even the most distant grin out of me or even a giggle out of the audience. C-3PO and R2-D2 were way funnier than Merry and Peppin.</li></ul><ul><li>the fight scenes in Moria went on a bit too long. The firey monster looked way hokey and fake.</li></ul><ul><li>the dwarf Gimli, played by John Rhys-Davies a.k.a. Sallah in INDIANA JONES, and the blonde archer played by Orlando Bloom were completely useless in the film. Barely said or did anything.</li></ul><ul><li>I can't really criticise the movie itself for this, but Gandalf's death felt simply wrong. I know it must've happened in the book too, but I was really upset by this event and it almost made me lose interest. Although I admired that this event almost moved me to tears, which is a sign of good character development, it p***ed me off, simply. In STAR WARS it felt right and logical that Obi-Wan had to die, but here it felt like they'd killed Han Solo right away. He was the most interesting and engaging character and now we'll never see him again. Too bad.</li></ul>All of this said, I couldn't find anything else bad to say. I enjoyed this movie a lot, and it's already in my top 20 list of favorite movies. It shows that you don't need to have read Tolkien's books to enjoy this movie. I gave this movie a 9.",9,0,0,6 January 2002
Cast Away," well made, moving film
","If this movie would've starred anyone else, it surely wouldn't've worked as well as it did. Tom Hanks plays his character as an everyman. Not as an ever-confident superhuman, but not as a total wimp either. That makes it easy to relate to his character, Chuck Noland. Technically, the movie is a marvel. Beautiful cinematography and excellent use of sound. They had the good sense to let out a music score to convey the utter silence on the island. The situations on the island he finds himself in are realistically portrayed, mostly thanks to a well-written script by William Broyles. The way he used the volleyball to make him have someone to talk to (other than air) was a master stroke. SPOILER AHEAD! It's even more amazing that the movie makes us sad when Chuck loses the ball. That is perhaps the saddest moment of the film. Some people were disappointed with the ending. Well, trust me, it's the only way they could've wrapped this kind of film up. Think of any other plausible ending and it just wouldn't've worked in the film. Everyone involved did a very respectable job in this film, making it one of the best ones released in 2000.

Cast Away," bad bad ending
","MEGASPOILERS ABOUT THE ENDING HERE!I hate good movies with bad endings... and this one left me with a bad taste in my mouth. Didn't the writer think we would feel really bad if Tom Hanks didn't reunite with his wife? I realise that it's hard to think of an ending with a movie like this, but this movie had the worst movie ending I've seen in a long time. All you see in the last scenes is Tom Hanks' skinny face and then... it stops. Finished. We have no idea of what will happen to this character we've gotten to know. Will he ever be happy again? We'll have to imagine that for ourselves. What a disappointment!That said, I must say that the movie was worth seeing in a theater. The scenes on the island are very well made and never boring. Actually, the whole movie is never boring. Tom's separation of Wilson had me teary-eyed. The scenes on the island are so extremely well done, in fact, that they single-handedly make this movie better than anything I've seen last year. They are scary, funny, exciting, and heart-breaking. Of course, the plane crash scene must also be mentioned, which can only be described as masterful action filmmaking. This is one of the best action scenes I've ever seen. If the whole movie would've been as good as the first, er... 100 minutes, I would've given it a 10. It's such a shame that it had such a lousy ending.

","A very rare instance where the sequel is just as good as the original. Writer-director James Cameron pulled out all the stops for this ambitious sequel (with a much higher budget than the original, the highest ever for a movie at the time), which contains spectacular action sequences, a better, if not as effectively simple storyline, and classic, Oscar-winning special effects (who can forget the 'liquid metal' scenes?). It's seven years after the events of the first movie, and John Connor, the future savior of the world, is a 12-year-old who lives with a foster family and has his mother locked up in an institute.

Aliens," Aliens (1986) D: James Cameron Rating:**1/2
","Action-packed sequel to the 1979 hit 'Ãlien' concentrates more on the action than the pure terror in the first one. The story is well thought, picking up right where its predecessor left off. Ripley has been floating around in space for the last 57 years and is now found by one of those guys from the Company. He tells her that the planet where the alien was found has been colonised and that contact was lost. She accepts to go to the planet to be an advisor to the classical bunch of macho marines as how to kill them. It has suspence and thrills going for it, but that sense of fear just isn't there anymore and the action becomes mechanical after a while.",9,0,2,23 February 2000
Saving Private Ryan," very good war film but...
","I saw this movie again last night as a dutch network premiere. I have to say it strengthened my impression after my first viewing some years ago. As war films get, it's one of the best, most realistic and exciting there are. And yet, I don't really understand the big deal that people sometimes make of war films. In my opinion, they shouldn't always by revered as 'important' films, or be taken with dead-seriousity. After all, no matter how realistic, they are made for entertainment value and little more. This is a movie that has terrific, bloody action, a realistic setting, superb cinematography and production design, well-developed characters, and some emotional moments. But people, is it really anything more than that? It is certainly not a lesson in history. Did private Ryan or captain Miller ever really exist? No. In Spielberg's SCHINDLER'S LIST, an obviously superior film, many of the characters shown really did exist. But SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is really just a work of fiction, crafted to manipulate and excite the viewer. I'm not saying that there are major historical innacuracies in it, since I'm not a historian, I'm just saying that it is in no way an extraordinary or transcendental movie experience. It is also far from Spielberg's most accomplished work. RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, E.T., and JAWS are all clearly on a much higher level, as they all transcend their genres and become something truly extraordinary. PRIVATE RYAN may be a very good war film, but lacks that extra bit of magic to make it truly extraordinary and a masterpiece in ever regard. Like so many war film, it doesn't truly leave an indelible impact on the viewer. And this is a member of the war film genre in every bone of its body. It doesn't surpass films like PLATOON, FULL METAL JACKET, APOCALYPSE NOW, as the Ultimate War Movie. If you want to see a true masterpiece, a film that is truly unforgettable and extraordinary, don't look for it among the war movies, trust me. See 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. See THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION. See RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK. Those are genuinely extraordinary pictures that transcend the limitations of their genres and bury themselves into your subconscious, never leaving your memories. SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, as well as every other war film ever made, can't possibly have that resonance.",8,0,1,13 March 2002
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," it's great!
","i really enjoyed this movie in the theatre, it's certainly the most entertaining film of 1997! This movie is definitely worthy of being a sequel of Jurassic Park: i'm not saying it's better than JP, but it comes very close. I know that the plot isn't as good as the one the original had, but i had a great time seeing it, and that's the only reason we go to see a movie, isn't it?   I came out of the theatre shaking almost as much as when i came out of JP back in 1993. The most suspenseful moment of the film was when Sarah is above the breaking glass: man, my heart was really beating fast! Also the ending (with the T-rex running around San Diego) was great and it was totally unexpected.

Amadeus," disappointing biography
","I re-watched this film recently after many years, and my opinion of it hasn't changed. This is a terribly flawed, disappointing film that's unjustly considered a classic. It had great potential, a biography of the great Mozart seen through the eyes of a mediocre composer, but the result fails in many areas and leaves one confused and hugely disappointed. Everything about this film is top-notch except for one crucial element: the script. It lacks punch, it lacks heart, it lacks momentum, and it lacks any particularly memorable dialogue. The actors do their best with this below-par script, and so does the director and the entire crew, who deserved their Oscars, but the film really suffers from its by-the-numbers screenplay by Peter Schaffer. It's clear he's a passionate music-lover, but it's also clear he isn't able to construct a compelling narrative too. I've never seen the play, but I've heard it's better than this film. I certainly hope so. Somehow those moments that are intended to generate emotions in the audience never really pay off. We never feel like something horrible has happened, the events onscreen never really involve you, but make you hope the film will get better. Playing loud classical music on the background for dramatic impact may be effective for some, but not for me. However, the film is exceptionally well filmed. The cinematography, sets, and costumes make this a real visual treat, and the actors are all wonderful in their roles. And of course the classical music score makes for wonderful listening. With all these impressive elements, it's a shame that the film's core, the script, is so bland and uninvolving. No matter how good a cast and crew you've got at your disposal, if your script is mediocre, then your movie will be too, and AMADEUS is perfect proof of this.",6,8,15,21 December 2001

The grass hoppers come by once year to eat the food which the ants have picked through the year. One day, Flik accidentally drops all the food collected for Hopper. He is now the enemy of the ant hill, because now the ants have to pick twice the resource of food for the grass hoppers. Then, flik comes up with a great idea: to get help from other, bigger ants to help them stand up for themselves. The queen thinks it's a ridiculous idea, but she sends him anyway so he can't screw anything up. Unexpectedly, flik succeeds in his mission and comes back with a bunch of who seem strong enough. But, when these guys appear to be just a group of circus clowns, the chaos begins...I won't give away the ending, simply because it's too good to be revealed.

2001: A Space Odyssey," my little insignificant summary of 2001
","I will admit right away that I'm one of those idiots that hadn't seen Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY before this re-release in occasion of the real year 2001. I was very surprised by the film in the way it wasn't boring at all like some people I knew had told me. It is a truly thought-provoking, awe-ispiring work, always intriguing and unpredictable, standing head and shoulders above almost every other sci-fi film ever made. No other film I have ever seen captured my sense of wonder and my subconscious so deeply. I still can't keep it away from my thoughts. It is without a doubt Kubrick's most accomplished work to date (I have seen most of his movies). Using tremendously impressive effects portraying the starkness and silence of space, Kubrick made an unparalelled masterpiece, that immensely rewarded those with attention spans longer than five seconds.After a majestic opening title scene showing the sun rise up from the moon and using the enchanting 'Also Sprach Zarathustra' tune by Richard Strauss at maximum volume, the film opens with a 20-minute sequence showing the lives of a tribe of prehistoric man-apes. In typically Kubrickian fashion, the film calmly watches those animals, which are just about a few dozen thousand years away from becoming human, defending themselves from leopards, fighting another ape tribe for the waterhole, sleeping. Just when you think you're watching the wrong movie, something really unexpected and weird happens: the family that we've been watching finds a big black stone of some unknown material standing rooted in the ground. It is a thing of extraordinary geometrical precision, something totally out of place in this primitive world, suddenly appeared there with mysterious purposes. We see the apes slowly approaching the thing in fear and wonder; eventually they will find the courage to touch it. As all this happens we hear a menacing background music with ominous voices, a classic example of Kubrick paranoia music, which will be heard everytime mankind comes in contact with a monolith, as the black thing is called later in the film. After that the movie cuts to what seems to be the next day, and as we see one of the apes toying around with some bones on the ground, we hear Strauss' famous tune slowly coming up again: we know that something important is about to happen. The ape finds a way to use one of the bones as a weapon and starts thumping enthusiastically on the other bones, detroying them. The film assumes that we understand that this is because of the monolith: it is helping the evolution of the apes, pushing them to become more intelligent. This ape, who seems to be the leader of the tribe, then leads them to the waterhole to once again face the other, stronger tribe, this time with something they had never had before: weapons. The others come unarmed and their leader is killed by 'our' tribe's leader, who is armed.After this comes one of the most famous shots in movie history: the ape who has just killed with the bone throws it in the air and after following it for a while, the camera abruptly cuts to about four million years into the future. It is the year 1999 after Christ and man, in Kubrick's vision in 1968, has by then conquered space (unfortunately we now know that he was too optimistic about progress in space travel). Finally you understand a bit of where the movie is going, and finally the 'Space' in the title makes sense. The movie doesn't tell us it's 1999, but we find out later. With more classical music Kubrick shows us his unique, stark, and meticulously realistic vision of space. The camera lingers over spaceships and a space station, where we meet the first human characters and we hear the first dialogue. The man we meet is one Heywood Floyd played by William Sylvester. Something typical of every Kubrick film is that every character remains distant, boring, and hard to connect with; here the character development is even less important than in any other film he has done. We never find out anything about him, although he does have an important scene where he talks to others about an epidemic on the Clavius moon base: the people he talks with are similarly vague characters, who serve only to advance the plot. This criticism of flat characterization actually isn't really a criticism: part of the film's point is that machines like HAL, who we will meet later, have more interesting personalities than humans. Humans are supposed to come off boring. Anyway, Floyd goes to a meeting where he finds out that the hubbub on Clavius is caused by a dug-up black monolith that has been buried there for, you guessed it, about four million years. Humans were attracted to it because it sent out powerful signals. The thing looks exactly like the one the apes found earlier in the film. In an hypnotic, enchanting sequence we watch Floyd and his team approaching the monolith with the same sense of wonder the apes felt. Once again we hear that haunting music with those scary voices singing in the background. Floyd and the others gather around the monolith to take a picture, but a few seconds later they are startled to hear a piercing shriek coming out of the monolith. We see those men writhing with pain in their ears, and it's almost unbearable for the audience too. After that we see a shot we have seen before: the sun rising up on top of the monolith. We saw it before, after the apes had found the monolith, but I haven't figured out the meaning of this shot yet. Perhaps a signal was sent out of the monolith on the moon because it saw the light of the sun for the first time, and wanted to let its creators know about it somehow.After this sequence the film takes another leap forward in time, though not one quite as huge as the first one. The year is now 2001 and the title card says 'Jupiter Mission: 18 months later'. In another classic sequence, we hear beautiful classic music as the camera pans across the spaceship Discovery, and the film's central act begins. Everything that happened before is a setup for this part. First we see one of the astronauts running round in the circular control room of the ship to keep himself fit. Once again these people remain unknown and distant to us. They are Mission Commander David Bowman (Keir Dullea), who will play an important part in the story, and astronaut Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood). The film lacks any comedic punch in its dialogue, but that's just the point. In the Discovery ship we meet the most intriguing character in the film (and one of the most intriguing characters in any film), and he's a computer. It's the famous HAL 9000 computer which controls the functions of the entire ship, and he is given a chilling, appropriately soulless voice by actor Douglas Rain. In the first scenes on Discovery we find out that HAL is supposed to be a fool-proof computer, incapable of commiting error. Soon later while HAL is chatting with David Bowman about his doubts on the mission's purpose, he mentions a fault that he's picked up in the AE-35 antenna on the ship. Here's where the trouble in the film starts: it turns out that the antenna is perfectly fine. That HAL has committed a mistake is alarming to Bowman and Poole, because he could now make mistakes about anything in the mission. They close themselves off in private to discuss the situation. They ultimately decide to shut him off and continue the mission by themselves. Little do they know that HAL is reading their lips and so knows about their intentions anyway. So when Poole has to go outside the ship to check the antenna again, HAL becomes evil and doesn't let him in again. He floats off into space and dies. And in the most suspenseful and dramatic scene in the movie we see Bowman struggling to get back into the ship from the space pod he's in.In case you don't know what happens next, let me tell you that the movie actually becomes moving and dramatic. All the following scenes have gone down in movie history, but the final 20 minutes, where the main character is taken on a dizzying 'journey beyond the infinite', definitely belong among the most confusing, strange, enigmatic, and ultimately astonishing endings ever shown. Kubrick has so much to tell the audience, so many messages in his big final revelation that many audience members will be lost on it. I was too, and after being dazzled by its complexity I did eventually 'get' it, or most of it anyway. This is a rare movie that has the courage to skewer with our perceptions about life and our place in the Universe. It's too soon to say for me, but I think it will change my way of looking at life. It is easy to see why it was initially rejected by critics and audiences and later gained a huge cult following, ran in theatres for many years, and was eventually considered universally as a classic. It's a film that you might have a hard time understanding the first time around, but later buries itself into your subconscious and doesn't leave you. It's definitely the closest-to-perfect film if there ever was one, and it might even change your mentality and perceptions as it did with me.",10,12,25,1 November 2001
2001: A Space Odyssey," wow!
","saw this flick recently for the 1st time. Pretty awesome. Definitely deserves all the praise. Shame I didn't see it ever before. This is quite an intense and weird film. Some say it's boring, but it actually kept my attention effortlessly. Far from boring. Very intriguing and beautifully done. Space has never been represented as convincingly as here. I was mesmerized by the effects work and sets. The camera work was dazzling. The movie is technically unparalelled. It is a pure feast for the eyes and ears. Effective use of classical and paranoia music. But does it have a plot? The amount of messages, and their depth, is mind-boggling. Can't be fully appreciated in one viewing. I've seen it twice, and I still don't get it entirely. This could be the most abstract and ambiguous film ever made. More than a film, it's a piece of art, like a painting. Open to numerous interpretations and points of view. The ending especially will leave you confused and dazzled. This is a tremendous achievement in every respect. How the director ever found the courage to try and realize this ambitious and complex project is also a mystery. If you haven't seen this film yet, do not hesitate and BUY it now. It is arguably the best in the sci-fi genre and one of the best films ever produced.",10,0,1,28 August 2001
The Mummy Returns," great fun
","THE MUMMY RETURNS, believe me, is Hollywood blockbuster at its best. In my opinion this one worked better than the original because it never let up with the action. It has a super thin plot, and loads of action, special effects, and fun. It is exciting and ceaselessly entertaining from beginning to end. It may be preposterous, but it's hard not to enjoy, and it's ten times better than TOMB RAIDER. Now THAT was a bomb.",7,1,1,19 March 2002
The Mummy Returns," pure fun: watch it, enjoy it, don't think, don't carp
","better than the first Mummy. The plot is more interesting and it makes sense once you're willing to believe in ancient curses and armies rising up from the sands. We know the characters after the first film and so we care about them. The Izzy character was a nice addition and I liked Ardeth Bay's part here. I actually hated the first mummy but this was twice as cool. The action was simply much more imaginative and the effects were lovely. Who can forget the little nasty pygme's or the Anubis warriors? Those are really great new creatures. The Scorpion King, on the other hand, looked weird and cartoonish. I liked the references to the first film. Here we find out that in her previous life Evy was the pharaoh's daughter, Nefertiti.

It truly makes the original pale in comparison. It makes you look at TOY STORY as merely a mediocre effort. Anyone who says TOY STORY 2 doesn't measure up to the original ought to have their IQ measured. I've simply never seen a movie quite as delightful, entertaining, cheerful, and simply perfect!

The setting in New York at christmas is great, this was the movie that made me want to go to New York. There are much more and much better traps.

If you think that this movie is silly because of the dialogue, it's obvious you're all forgetting that this movie was made to entertain! It's the same thing with star wars: it's sort of a fable, and the dialogue is much cheesier than that of this film. It has great music, great special effects, great sound and fantastic cinematography.

Scream 2," i love it as much as the first one, maybe even more!
","this movie has to be the best horror sequel ever. That is because it surpasses its predecessor with ease. As much as i loved the original Scream, it can't top this one. It's just got more suspense, more slashes and more humor. The first one had many dull moments, like the ending (too much talking). But this one never disappoints, although i have to admit the opening scene in Scream 1 is better. But the problem is, it just goes downhill from there. But Scream 2, i don't watch only to see the opening scene, because the best parts are what comes after that. Especially the scene where the two girls have to get out of the car through the unconscious killer. This movie is just much more suspenseful than the first one!Good job Wes, you have accomplished the impossible: a horror sequel that is better than its predecessor.

The Green Mile," another wonderful Frank Darabont prison drama!
","THE GREEN MILE is a very absorbing and engrossing story. As you watch this film, you get so wrapped up in the story and its characters, that you totally forget the passing of time. Although it's over 3 hours long, the time here passes even faster than it did in TITANIC, another excellent 3 hour+ movie. This is a story about the life of a prison guard who works in a cell block where they execute people with the electric chair. When he meets the newest prison inmate, who's about 7 feet tall, he seriously doubts the guilt of the crime for which he was sent to prison. He discovers he's a very sweet and childlike person, and he even has a gift of taking diseases away from people.  I can't tell you more than that, because I'm afraid I'd spoil the movie for you. If you're in the mood for a long and moving story set in prison (somewhat like THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION), then rent this movie.",7,1,2,26 November 2000
Scream," great horror thriller, this movie rocks!
","this is the movie that started it all for me. This was the movie that got me interested in the horror genre. Because i liked so much, i started renting almost all the horror movies in the video store. Although Scream 2 came close, none of the movies i have rented were as creepy and scary as this one. It is very rare for a horror to be so plenty of dark humor. The whole idea of a killer getting his inspiration from scary movies is, in my opinion, very realistic and creepy. It shows what a scary movie freak is capable of doing.It's no wonder Kevin Williamson is very busy writing at the moment, he's brought back the whole horror genre. If it wasn't for Scream, we wouldn't have I Know What You Did Last Summer, Urban Legend, The Faculty or even Halloween H20. Not that it would be a big loss if we didn't have any of these movies, but still.But the person who's to credit more than anyone for this movie is director Wes Craven. It was this guy who gave the movie the creepy feel it had, especially in the opening scene.Scream is without a doubt the best horror flick of the '90s.",8,0,0,28 December 1999

","i think most of this movie's rating is because of the great music, which should have won several prizes. Heck, i would watch this movie just to see the beginning theme! But it's not only that which makes this movie as good as it is, of course. It's actually the last horror film to be actually suspenseful. Think about it: all that came after 'Halloween' were the friday movies and the halloween sequels, which were all pretty bad. This movie is certainly than the modern day horror films to which i am used to, but that doesn't take away i didn't like it! In fact, i think i liked it more than Scream, of which am the biggest fan.

","all this film has going for it is the production design. This movie is dreary, ugly, and very pessimistic. The buildings of the future are very huge and advanced, but the people in the film are all depressed and cynical. Harrison Ford gives the worst performance of his career. It is hard to see why this film is praised so much by people. The storytelling is totally muddled and terribly hard to follow. You might think I should watch this film again to appreciate it, but I won't. That's the last thing I would do. Watching the film for me was painful. And what's with that scene were the bad guy kills some other guy by squishing his eyes out and crushing his skull? Couldn't he have killed in another way? This film has no redeeming features whatsoever apart from the aforementioned set designs, which are quite inventive. The characters are all far from interesting. All actors give flat, superficial performances. The story is extremely depressing. I can't recommend this film at all. One thing I did forget to mention is the beautiful music score by Vangelis. But that's not nearly enough for me to watch this film again. It is downright awful!",6,1,5,23 August 2001
The Sixth Sense," not as good as expected
","i went to this movie expecting a really good and scary masterpiece film. But, i was pretty disappointing. There were some creepy scenes in it, but of it was really boring. It was just too much ofthe same things. A ghost passes by, he says something un-scary, he walks away, the boy gets scared and tells about it to Bruce Willis. A few minutes later, the plot has completely forgotten about that particular event. It pretends that we are scared by every stupid ghost with blood coming out of his head, while we weren't. Throughout the film i thought about that surprising ending everyone had talked about, but when the end finally came, i wasn't 'surprised'at all, i knew this was gonna happen from the beginning! Therefore, i can't understand how come this movie is getting so much praise. It is truly overrated. If you're planning on seeing it, let me give you some advice: don't expect it to be as good as everyone said. Maybe you'll enjoy it more, because i thought it would be fantastic and i was very disappointed.",7,0,0,28 January 2000

I think this movie also should have been nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture, the one for Best Editing and the one for Best Music.

Sometimes i even put it on pause to glare at the special effects shots, like when Neo wakes up in the real world. You should try do that too, only then you can truly observe the visual excellence of these scenes. This movie totally deserved the oscar for visual effects (sorry phantom menace!).

The only film that is better, to me, than the Matrix, is Raiders of the Lost Ark. I love Morpheus' voice and also the things he says about the world how it will in two centuries, are very interesting AND scary. That's what i liked about this film, it was really frightening. The kung fu scenes are really entertaining and fast, and Keanu's acting is at its best. Trinity is really cool, it's unusual to see a woman shooting all the bad guys. Agent Smith is a really cool villain, he's one of the meanest guys in film history (especially the voice is very creepy). This film actually doesn't have one dull moment in it.

Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," why is this movie called a classic?
","how can people still worship this movie I can't understand. Classics are movies that stand the test of time. This one doesn't. The special effects are dated, the acting is nauseating, and the whole movie is just boring. The only thing that this movie has is the music. John Williams is one great musician. But the movie doesn't hold up now. If you look at the two sequels, they are much more entertaining. Somehow I find them soooo much better. At least they have some story and some character development. THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is sÃÂºch a superior movie to this one. I think the reason why this movie is being rated so high is because people remember how they experienced it as kids or teenagers. I'm sure they had quite a lot of fun when they first saw it, because the SFX were so good, and the story was simple and uncomplicated. But this movie is no longer entertaining today. I was bored silly when I first saw it a few years ago. Then I rented the sequels and found out they were much better. This movies had much more interesting stories and better dialogue. Maybe George Lucas is to blame. He certainly broke new ground when he made this movie, I got to give him that, but the superior sequels were directed and written by others (not many people know this). A while ago, George returned to directing with the prequel, EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE, which in my eyes was a complete disaster. That movie made me even more dubious of Lucas' writing and directing talents. BUT, getting back to this movie, today watching it is a waste of time. Trust me, you'll be bored to death if you rent this movie today for curiosity purposes, like I did. G'day!",9,0,0,18 April 2001
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," STAR WARS: SPECIAL EDITION (1997)
","The impact of STAR WARS on those who are writing about movies today can be measured by the number of reviews or articles of the past few months which began as follows: 'I was x years old in 1977...' The release of George Lucas' seminal blockbuster 20 years ago was the kind of happening which affected a generation of movie-goers, and I include myself in that generation. I was 10 years old in 1977, and when you were 10 years old in 1977 you were not judged by whether you had seen STAR WARS; you were judged by how many _times_ you had seen STAR WARS. It awed us, it delighted us...and yes, hyperbolic though it might seem to say so, it changed us.As much as it changed the people who watched movies, however, it changed the people who made movies even more. Hollywood heads were sent spinning by the success of STAR WARS, a film with no stars, a simplistic story-line out of old Westerns and some nifty special effects. It was not long before studio executives realized that two fundamental lessons of STAR WARS could be translated to other films: 1) If you made a special effects-laden adventure with a modicum of skill and dropped it into your summer release schedule, when young potential movie-goers had summer job money burning holes in their pockets, they would come and come again, story be damned; 2) One successful film could turn into one or two more, plus action figures, lunchboxes and T-shirts (the twin goddesses of Franchising and Merchandising). And thus STAR WARS begat the 'event film,' which begat BATMAN, which begat TWISTER and INDEPENDENCE DAY. And they slew the medium-budget film, and there was much wailing and gnashing of teeth.You can't really blame Lucas for what has happened to American film-making, though, because there is no way he intended for crass commercial concerns to become so dominant. There is no way STAR WARS could have worked if he _had_ had such an intention. Lost in all the ink spilled with references to Joseph Campbell, back-brain mythopoetics and anti-technological humanism is the fact that STAR WARS was not a great movie. The most surprising thing a viewer might find in the SPECIAL EDITION has nothing to do with with the dozens of critters tossed into the backgrounds, but rather how restless he might get waiting through the first half. For nearly an hour, STAR WARS is characterized by the fussy quarrelsomeness of C-3P0 (Anthony Daniels), the intergalactic Leo Buscaglia sermonizing of Ben Kenobi (Alec Guinness) and the laughably petulant plea by Luke (Mark Hamill) to 'go to Tashi Station and pick up some power converters. STAR WARS wasn't a great movie; it was, however, an extraordinary movie-going experience. You sat in a theater with a few hundred other people and for two hours you were utterly transported, because it was innocent in a way no film can ever be innocent again. You felt as though you were part of something joyous, a celebration of cinema as fantasy and a celebration of good triumphing over evil. In an era when you can see the veins bulging on big-budget action films as they strain to impress you, STAR WARS was effortless in its enchantment.That movie-going experience is what this re-release is all about. The difference between STAR WARS on the big screen and STAR WARS on the small screen is the difference between Mount Rushmore and a picture of Mount Rushmore, between Wagner on a cassette deck and Wagner played by a symphony orchestra. If there is an element of not-inconsequential element of nostalgia in the way crowds will flock to this re-release, that is understandable; many will be hoping to re-capture a youthful moment when they fell in love with movies for the first time. STAR WARS: SPECIAL EDITION may end up disappointing those who come to it as though on a pilgrimage, but the dazzling editing of the climactic trench run will certainly remind anyone who has seen what passes for a 'spectacular' in the last few years how exciting a science-fiction adventure film can be.There has been some consternation over the idea of Lucas fiddling with such a cherished film, but frankly, I don't understand all the fuss. This isn't a case of someone whose only connection with a film is ownership of its rights deciding to colorize it; this is a director's attempt to realize the vision he always had for his film, a fairly common practice in an era of 'Director's Cut' video and laserdisc releases. Some of the new additions are merely window dressing, including Han Solo's (Harrison Ford) encounter with Jabba the Hutt; others, like a scene between Luke and his friend Biggs (Garrick Hagon) help set up later scenes more effectively. But if anything Lucas has done threatens someone's memories of a first experience of STAR WARS, I can only suggest that the experience couldn't have been terribly profound. In terms of the details, this is a different STAR WARS, but it is the spirit of this story which has moved people for twenty years. Now they have the opportunity to come once again -- some with their children -- and visit that galaxy far, far away.",9,0,0,7 February 2001

","because of the new star wars movie hype, i decided to rent the original trilogy to watch it again. I recall watching it once on TV when i was 5 or so. I thought that the first episode was the worst of them all. They all were good, but this was the most pathetic one. The special effects really look dated, and the attempts at humor are cliched. Anyway, about the special effects, i guess they looked wonderful in 1977. But one thing is for sure: the effects were better in episodes V & VI. Another thing i didn't like about it, was that there weren't many different locations, it was all on Tatooine or on the Death Star.

Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," BEST action/adventure film ever!
","THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK totally surprised me after the disappointment that was STAR WARS. I rented the film as a curiosity item, but found it very boring and uninteresting. So I wasn't so keen on renting the next episode, but since so many people said it was so much better than the first, I tried it. And I was blown away by it. It was so good, I even bought it. Now I've seen it dozens of times. I never expected it to be so good! I was totally amazed by the effects (great for their time!), the action & adventure and the exciting story. This one moves much faster than STAR WARS. Irvin Kershner is a much better storyteller than George Lucas. I still wonder why he chose not to direct this one and leave it in the hands of someone else. It's the same thing Steven Spielberg directing all of the Indiana Jones films. But I'm happy Lucas made that choice. This movie probably wouldn't have turned as good as it did. It's hard to describe what's so good about this movie and the way it makes you feel as you're watching it. The most important feeling it gives me is the sense of wonder. The space battles are truly breathtaking, and are better than anything else you see in movies today. I think it's safe to say that they truly don't make them like they used to. Hollywood forgot that the most important thing in an action & adventure film is caring about the people who are in danger and creating interesting characters. I don't think we'll ever see another movie like TESB again.In conclusion, simply GO SEE THIS MOVIE NOW. Even if you've seen it dozens of times, watching this movie for the hundredth time will always be a more pleasant experience than watching those crappy films in video stores today.Beware of the original release.

Great sets, great sword fights, great cruel Darth Vader and lots of new characters. Interesting relationship between Luke and Yoda. A darker more serious tone, with good people becoming evil. These are the good parts of the movie. A great disappointment was the ending, because there wasn't one. The battle scenes on Cloud City were  too long.

Gladiator," who cares about historical inaccuracy?
","GLADIATOR is a fantastic achievement in modern filmmaking. I never expected to ever see another Roman epic, but Ridley Scott has proved it is possible. What's so great about this movie is that it has a really entertaining and enthralling storyline, not just special effects and action (although it has a lot of that): it knows how to make us care about the people in it and how to develop a sense of style and elegance (thanks to director Ridley Scott). The movie is fueled by a number of powerhouse performances: Russell Crowe is perfect as the title character, I loved Oliver Reed as Proximo, and Joaquin Phoenix made a perfectly hissable villain. I was amazed at how exciting this movie was. Although the opening battle sequence is not very promising, with its confusing, chaotic editing, after that it's just uphill: the film will send you on roller-coaster ride of nonstop thrills. The effects are very well done: there is a scene where we see Commodus arrive at Rome as the new emperor that's absolutely breathtaking. I also loved the way they recreated the Colosseum. Parts of this movie are truly awe-ispiring. The fights in the arenas are spectacularly sensational. I must also mention John Mathieson's absolutely beautiful cinematography and Hans Zimmer's perfect music score. Some scenes where Mathieson's visuals and Zimmer's music mix are undescribably beautiful and breathtaking. The entire film is beautiful: just about any frame of it would make a really good poster to stick on the wall. I recommend this film to those who appreciate to finest things in life.",9,5,7,4 June 2001
Gladiator," boring, cliched, unoriginal, flawed. A disappointment! *could contain spoilers*
","i expected much better from this movie. This movie has seriously been overrated by everyone. Sure, it ain't bad, but it's not much better than movies like Mask of Zorro, Star Wars etc. But the critics raised this movie to incredible heights, saying it was a masterpiece. Well, this movie's no masterpiece at all. What makes it disappointing are its simple characters and simple story. We've seen this kind of plot a hundred times before. Strangely, this movie kind of reminded me of the Zorro movie, which i think is a better movie. That movie also had a fight at the end between the hero and the bad guy, and somehow i liked that scene better. Although we knew who was going to win, it was much more exciting than this one. Here it's just way too short and also implausible, 'cause Maximus was dying before the fight began. But getting back to the movie, i found the plot too simple and predictable to really be able to like it. The audience of my theatre wasn't really impressed, either: they all got up from their seats as soon as 'Directed by Ridley Scott' appeared! But no matter what i say, everyone's going to see this movie. Advice: don't raise your expectations too high.",9,0,0,4 June 2000
Gladiator," hmmmm...
","I just wanted to say that I think it's strange that the users of this website give this movie such high votes and then give it such negative reviews. Just click to see the latest user comments and 90% of them will be negative, trust me. So why, then, did this movie get a rating 8.1 on the database and a solid position in the top 250? Personally I think it's a very good movie, it keeps you riveted to your seat from start to finish. Great performances, great action, wonderful music and production design. It was easily the most memorable movie to come out of 2000. CROUCHING TIGER, you say? Boring hokum. TRAFFIC? Well intentioned, but highly unpleasant and tedious. ALMOST FAMOUS? Unwhimsical, repetitious gobbledygook. CAST AWAY? Pretty funny on the island, extremely crappy everywhere else. GLADIATOR was the film to see, and it more than deserved the Oscars it got. I swear I turned off the Oscars when I saw that TRAFFIC WON for best director. All the guy did was shake his camera around and stage dialogue scenes. Ridley Scott is one great director and GLADIATOR is easily his best film ever. People who don't like it should ask themselves if they like movies at all, since GLADIATOR is so obviously what they are all about.",9,0,0,17 February 2002
Gladiator," I don't know about anybody else, but if I'm watchi...
","I don't know about anybody else, but if I'm watching a car chase or a martial arts fight or one guy hacking another guy's head off with an axe, I want to see it. Is that so hard? For some unknown reason, directors are equating style with the ability to shake the camera around so the audience can't see anything. Now this idiotic trend has grabbed Ridley Scott by the testicles. Let me give you an idea what watching this film's action sequences is like:It's as though                               I wr                               ote the ent ire                                           review som ethi ng lik             e                   this.Now, wasn't that fun? Russell Crowe plays General Maximus, who's the leader of the armies of the Roman Empire. He's just finished beating the crap out of the barbarian hordes when Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) decides he's going to make Maximus the new emperor, spurning his cleft-lip son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). This p***es Commodus off so he kills dear old dad, kills Maximus's family, and tries to kill Maximus, who barely escapes. Maximus ends up a slave, but he starts fighting, eventually becomes the best gladiator in the land and travels back to Rome so he can have his revenge on Commodus.Aside from the action sequences, which made me feel like someone was jackhammering my head, the major problem with the film lies with Commodus, who, if he had any brains at all, would have had Maximus killed the second he saw him. Just take him in the back and bash in his head, then insist he slipped in the tub. Instead, Maximus is able to plot with Commodus's sister, Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), and one of the senators (Derek Jacobi). Of course, Commodus is clueless the entire time. Basically, by the time the film is over, you wonder how the Roman Empire managed to conquer anything.",9,0,0,9 February 2001
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," one of the finest action/adventure films ever made.
","How do you make an Indiana Jones film even better? By adding Sean Connery to the cast. With the one two punch of Harrison Ford and Sean Connery, it is pretty darn difficult to come up with a bad final product. When you add Steven Spielberg as the director and George Lucas as producer and one of the writers, all the elements are there for a spectacular film experience. Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade does not disappoint on any level. Other than the fact that this has long been reputed to be the last film in the series. One can not be just a little sad that this much talent may never collaborate again to make another one of these films that really represent why people love going to the movies.This time out, Indiana's (Ford) father, Henry Jones (Connery) is working for a wealthy collector who is financing his life long quest for the Holy Grail. The Nazis, who are also interested in the Grail, are in competition with Jones. (I guess they are still ticked off over that whole Lost Ark thing.) Anyway, Jones goes missing. So son Indiana travels to his fathers last known location, Venice, to try to find out what happened to his father and also see if he can't complete his father's search for the Grail. He travels with longtime friend, Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliot), and the hook up with the elder Jones' assistant, Dr. Elsa Schneider (Alison Doody). Together the three search Venice for clues to the location of the Grail. Jones eventually finds his father who joins the group on the quest for the Grail. As usual, Indiana's adventures are never dull, and this time he has to deal with Nazis, rats and a high speed boat chase on the way to his goal of the Grail.Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade is very well written and lives up to the first two films. No disappointments here. The film opens with a flashback sequence with Indiana as a boy and explains many of the reasons that Indiana is the man he is. Last Crusade is frequently funny which is a tribute as much to the interaction of the leads as it is to the sharp writing. Harrison Ford and Sean Connery are perfectly cast as the father and son who don't always see eye to eye. Throw in the supporting cast of Denholm Elliot and John Rhys-Davies (Sallah), both returning to their roles from Raiders Of The Lost Ark and there are more than a few light moments intertwined with the seemingly nonstop action.Like the previous films, Steven Spielberg gives us a film filled with elaborate stunts and the sort of settings that can only be found in an Indiana Jones movie. There is virtually nothing wrong with this movie from a technical standpoint. Last Crusade has stood up well in the 12 years since it first hit the big screen. It is easily one of the finest action/adventure films ever made. This film also compares very well to the first one, Raiders Of The Lost Ark, which in my opinion, is quite possibly the best film ever made.9/10",9,0,0,8 February 2001
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," 9.6 out of 10
","this is a brilliant action/adventure film. It has a great plot, some great one-liners, great action scenes, great music, and that's about everything you can expect from any Indiana Jones movie. 'The Mummy', a perfect example of a failed adventure film, had none of these qualities. It had boring characters, a boring plot, cheap effects, and stupid lines. This could be even better a movie than 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', which would make THIS the best adventure film of all time. There are so many reasons why this is such a great ending to such a great film series. It tells you more about Indy's background in a wonderful opening where we see him as a kid. The scenes in Venice are greatly entertaining and look a lot like they come from a Bond flick. It has a great scene where Indy accidentally runs into Hitler himself, and he signs him an autograph! That scene is funnier and more clever than anything else in the series. There are many other funny and exciting scenes in the film, but the part that really stands out is the ending: it's very powerful, it's exciting, it's awe-ispiring, and it's emotional unlike any other scene in the Indy films. In the very end, you even find out how our hero got his weird name. In short, this fantastic film is GOLD for action fans, and movie fans in general. Highly recommended to anyone who enjoys film.",9,0,0,16 November 2000
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," boring, unfunny
","I was really ready to enjoy this movie. After reading some very positive reviews for it and hearing it was weird and funny I decided to rent it. It had competition from the likes of Space Cowboys, Meet the Parents, Crouching Tiger, and Nurse Betty (all of which I could've rented) but I felt confident somehow this movie was going to be worth my money. But it was quite a mistake I made. Although this movie looked beautiful, it was boring and often made no sense. I didn't laugh once. It was definitely weird and unusual, but not worth the money to see. It was completely pointless. Maybe I just didn't 'get' it. Perhaps you'll like it; I guess it's a 'love it or hate it' kind of movie. Thank you for reading this review.",4,6,14,16 June 2001
