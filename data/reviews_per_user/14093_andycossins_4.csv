Blade Runner 2049," A triumph in every respect. *minor spoilers*
","It's a tad too long. The scene with the newborn replicant is unnecessary and cruel. The entire Deckard/Rachel scene should have been cut. That said, 2049 is nothing short of a modern classic. Beautifully shot, written, directed; acted, scored, edited.. the list goes on. Gosling gives the most impressively subtle yet intense performance, and both Hoeks & Armas are perfectly cast. For me, 2049 stands with SW:TFA and Batman:TDK as one of the greatest movies yet of this century.",10,0,3,18 December 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," An utter travesty. *minor spoilers*
","It comes to something when the best thing one can say about a Star Wars director is 'he 'almost' got Yoda right'. The 'iron joke' was laugh out loud funny though, to be fair (although there's something very telling about that). I reckon I can edit it down to (maybe) an hours worth of a good movie. Just be grateful that Kennedy had the wisdom to beg JJ to direct the final episode.In all seriousness though, the person you should feel VERY sorry for is Daisy Ridley, who at this point is almost single-handedly carrying a four billion dollar investment. That's a lot of pressure for young shoulders. Yes, Adam Driver and (even) Mark Hamill shine, but mostly when they share a scene with Ridley, who is quite marvellous (did I mention?). John Boyega was badly let down, and I simply didn't care for anyone else: twenty minutes in I was rooting for the First Order.Conclusion? Daisy Ridley summed it up with her final sentence.",Null,1,1,18 December 2017
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Faithful to original films whilst bringing something new.
",Abrams' achievement in rebooting SW with such faithfulness to the original trilogy will guarantee his place in the history books as perhaps the greatest movie director.,Null,0,4,19 December 2017
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The greatest example of theatrical cinema ever!
","The Empire Strikes Back will forever be the epitome of theatrical cinema, as envisioned by Wagner. Cherish it, the art of film-making in this way is lost.",Null,0,0,18 December 2017
