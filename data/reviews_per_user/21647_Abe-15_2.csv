Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," What a bummer
","This movie was very disappointing. I was expecting a quality movie with good, or at least believable acting, and a plot. Instead I was treated to a children's movie. Clearly, this movie was not designed for anyone more mature than a pre-teen. The actors were wasted. This movie invested in some of the finest acting talent in the world: Liam Neeson and Samuel Jackson are excellent actors who were wasted on a movie that was made for people who have probably never heard of them. Had I been ten years old this movie would no doubt be among my favorites. However, as someone who has progressed beyond adolescence, this movie was a great disappointment. Hopefully episode II will mature with the age of the audience that episode I was designed for.",3,0,1,14 July 1999
American Pie," Funny
","One of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Absolutely worth the cost of admission. Although the humor is vulgar and sophomoric, that is the whole point, and it is creatively and and well done. American Pie is an all around fun movie to see, and as long as you aren't expecting anything deep or profound, you will leave the theater with a smile on your face, and something to laugh about for the rest of the evening.",9,0,0,14 July 1999
