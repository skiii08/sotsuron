Million Dollar Arm," Baseball with an Indian flavour in a Disney fairytale
","Feel good, fun film, very predictable but still manages to hold attention thanks to its Indian flavor and the self-discovery some of the characters go through, particularly Jon Hamm.Jon is a sports agent down to his last throw of dice when he convinces a Chinese entrepreneur (Tzi Ma) to fund a search for new baseball pitcher from India's vast pool of cricket bowlers, setting it up as a talent hunt, criss-crossing the country. After many a hiccup, they finally narrow it down to 2 candidates, Suraj and Madhur and whisk them, along with Pitobash (a wanna be baseball coach, translator) to the USA to get them to train, get ready for a tryout in a very tight deadline. Things don't go exactly as planned and Jon at one point complains about having signed up for a talent contest, not to become a primary care-giver. His business partner, Aasif (remember him from Ghost Town ?) and tenant, Lake Bell, are the ones helping keep things on track, while Alan Arkin and Bill Paxton as the baseball scout and coach, try to help with their wise counsel, while Darshan Jariwala plays a cameo. This is a film that doesn't really go deep but keeps things moving while skimming through what the characters are going through. The adjustment issues – Jon's to India and then later for the Indian trio in America are humorously and quickly told. The relationship between Jon and Lake – beginning with a broken down washing machine, then Skype and later at home is crucial to the plot. And most fascinating of all is watching Jon's character, the deal hungry, self-centered sports agent, try and figure out what life is about – of course, with a few helpful nudges from friendsSport movies usually suffer from predictable endings and this one is no exception. It drags a bit in the second half too but the music score by A R Rahman helps gloss over that. It's a true story apparently but one, surprisingly not too many Indians are aware of, so in that sense, the chief objective of doing the talent hunt, to popularize baseball in India, doesn't really seem to have worked. Unfortunately, going by the low key promotion, release and the small crowds, even the film wont help do that hereMore at ApurvBollywood at blogspot",6,6,14,10 May 2014
The Happening," M Night Shyamalans downward spiral continues
","I think M Night Shyamalan has lost his Sixth Sense, I can see the Signs, its clearly Happening.I think there must be a reason why you want to spook people, some message you want to get across. If suddenly people start killing themselves, and it spreads like an epidemic throughout the north-east of USA, then for sure it spooks you. Also people finding different innovative ways of killing themselves doesn't make for pleasant watching in the best of times / movies. And it drags  more people kill themselves, we get exposed to some of the classic American nut-cases, then more people kill themselves. And we still don't know why Mark Wahlberg, as a science school teacher, plays his part pretty convincingly. Somehow, recently, I've had an overdose of him, having seen him in 'The Invincible', and 'The Shooter' apart from 'The Italian Job' (the remake, one of my favourite movies). Maybe it's a sign ? He was good in this movie as well, trying to manage his wife and a kid while trying to figure out whats happening amidst the bewildering going-ons. It's a well made film, as far as the art of film-making goes. Some nice jokes, a lot of tension, some emotion etc. But you cant help but wonder what was the point of it all !? I loved Sixth Sense, didn't think much of Signs and successfully dodged his other movies (Village, Lady in the Water). I think the director is on a non-stop downward spiral. I was proud of myself for predicting the ending, for predicting the way he would end the film. Until my wife cattily remarked it could be because I've started thinking like him. After watching the Happening, that wasn't a compliment For more reviews, read apurvbollywood at blogspot Thx",3,3,9,13 June 2008
The Dark Knight Rises," Pity the people who will attempt to remake this in 10-15 yrs and have to top this
","My first action on exiting the hall after the morning show was to book for another show in the evening and round up the entire family to join me for that.There is an air of impending doom about the film, of heightened senses, pumping adrenalin, jaw dropping stunts, which is enhanced, impeccably, by a mouth-watering background score. Full of chants, and pulsating drum beats. With clear battle lines drawn between a larger than life villain and a hero, who, in the best traditions of Hindi films, just refuses to fade away. There is more than a touch of a Hindi film about it, as our hero battles with foes from within and outside. Foes, like Bane (Tom Hardy) who are well prepared, have planned their attack for years and will stop at nothing to fulfill the League of Shadows plans for Gotham's ultimate destruction. Anne Hathway (Catwoman), Joseph Gordon Levitt (a police officer, Blake) are unlikely allies with Gary Oldman (the Police Commissioner) and Michael Caine (Alfred) providing the usual support cast. There is a beautiful symmetry given to the story, most loose ends tied up neatly towards the end, questions answered, doubts clarified and the film leaving a strong, central message. Hope never dies. The point of a symbol like Batman, is precisely that anyone can be BatmanThere is so much to love and learn about the film. The sheer scale of the stunts, and the vivid imagination that goes behind them. The build up of towards the climax, the battle royale as the forces of good line up versus the forces of evil. The delicate side stories weaved in so simply, with minimal diversion of attention and time, that help explain it all, humanize the characters. Hans Zimmer's electric score, which falls to a pin drop silence at times, and builds to a heart pumping crescendo at others. I loved the delicate messages thrown in. How the fear of death is possibly the most powerful impulse. That hope is necessary for despair. Of how our government can so easily be brought to its knees. How easily we can gravitate towards lawlessness, the rule of the jungle. There are moments when you wonder 'how' ? There are clearly moments which defy logic. But that is when the spectacle takes over. You cheer for the good guys and hope and pray for them to win, against all odds. Wouldn't want to have it any other way More at www.apurvbollywood.blogspot.com",9,5,12,20 July 2012
