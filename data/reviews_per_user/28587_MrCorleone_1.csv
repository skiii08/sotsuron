Catch Me If You Can," clever and funny!
","Spielberg has taken a rest from his science fiction thought thinkers and brings us a new smart, clever, funny, film that all should enjoy. Hanks and Walken are at their best showing us the interesting adventures of Abagnale. I found it to be one of the funnest films i've seen in a while. 10/10",10,2,3,24 December 2002
