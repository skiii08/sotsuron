Ford v Ferrari," Exhilarating
","I don't write many reviews. Seeing this movie drove me to leave one. Ford v Ferrari exemplifies all that's good about movie-making. We were totally enthralled with the story and it's historical significance. There was no shooting, mayhem or violence. One can walk away and feel proud that it's all about American ingenuity, grit and determination. Bravo to the actors involved. The entire effort ran on all cylinders! We loved it. Thank you.",10,2,5,16 November 2019
