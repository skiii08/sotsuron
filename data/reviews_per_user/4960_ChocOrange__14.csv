War Dogs," Entertaining but flawed
","War Dogs does its job of presenting its pretty unbelievable story in a pleasing time passing manner.With a stronger script and direction it could well have been a really good film. It just misses out, and I can't help feeling a decent script doctor could have worked wonders.It will keep you entertained, so it's well worth a watch, but you'll probably think 'why did they think that was a good idea' a few too many times to elevate it above mediocre but worth watching status.",6,1,2,6 December 2017
Molly's Game," Very Entertaining
","A very polished script as usual from Aaron Sorkin, in his directorial debut, that allows the actors to shine.Well worthy of your time.",7,1,3,27 March 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Mediocre entry into the franchise
","Very slow to start and the High School 'humour' scenes are on par with the dreadful Wonder Woman 'humour' scenes. Obviously these must appeal to the target market of just out of puberty to late teens. It seems their humour levels haven't yet matured above the puerile, seen it 20 times before level. To be fair they probably haven't...Unlike Wonder Woman, at least this livens up in the last half and delivers a few half-decent CGI action scenes.On the CGI front, many early scenes of Spiderman have HORRIBLE gravity and physics. It's way too easy to spot the difference between CGI and a real human.Must try harder!",6,1,7,28 October 2017
Suicide Squad," Worse than expected
","Reviewers here keep saying it's not as bad as you heard. They're right - it's worse! Sadly, as long as these dire 'super hero' movies keep getting punters into the cinemas and making profits, the producers will keep churning them out.The effects here are actually better and more consistent than both Spiderman Homecoming and Wonderwomen, but the characters and writing is so below par, it makes for a far worse experience.Please producers, look at 'Logan' and see what it did right and why people rate it so highly. A decent script and characters that had depth, coupled with excellent effects that complemented the story rather than trying to usurp it.",4,0,0,3 December 2017
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Thoroughly enjoyable film. Top notch film-making,
","Superb script, direction, performances, music, editing, cinematography. Did I miss anything? Of course, but you get my drift.Everything comes together superbly, under writer/director's Martin McDonagh's assured hands. The mix of hilarious dark comedy, pathos and adventurous story for adults is a welcome change to the usual banal teen-centric films Hollywood produces all too often.Just go watch it, wallow in it and let it work its magic.",9,13,25,18 February 2018
Baby Driver," Above average slick action movie
","Very nicely made action flick with superbly slick camera work from Bill Pope elevating this action flick well above the norm. A few very long takes integrated perfectly with the soundtrack.It actually gets better on repeated viewings as you realise just how clever it is. Some great car chases; Edgar Wright has done his homework on the movies to homage and he's created some very exiting moments which is usually difficult to pull off in chases. A chase scene with Hocus Pocus by Focus gets my vote any day.Wildly entertaining for the most part. As many have commentated, the eclectic mix of songs plays a very integral part in the film.It's definitely on the side of slick eye-candy rather than clever plot, even if the script is intelligent in places.Well worth adding to your watch list.",9,2,5,12 September 2017
Justice League," Another dud
","More overblown action with some surprisingly bad cgi towards the end.
Terrible plot: yes,
Terrible Acting: yes,
Ultra terrible script : double yes,
Terrible.... just about everythingThe effects when good were actually very good. The film's saving grace. Keep Batman out of these superhero ensembles. He should exist a more grounded world without everyone having superpowers. Christopher Nolan's films had the right balance. Studios ruin a good franchise! No surprise.",4,0,1,28 March 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," Finally, a really good movie from the Marvel stable
","It's been hyped as good and surprisingly it actually lives up to it.After a few lacklustre 'origin' stories with a some decent films mixed in, Marvel have brought many stories and characters together into this film to provide a VERY entertaining romp.It's hugely dependent on the action and CGI and thankfully these are superbly handled as befits its astonishingly high budget. Although Spiderman in his first few swings still isn't quite right. Luckily, just like the last Spiderman movie it sorts itself out (is this an in-joke?).A nice simple story with a decent number of cracking one-liners built into a very adept script, allows the action to proceed with aplomb into its numerous excellent set-pieces.Great fun. More please!",9,1,6,1 August 2018
Get Out," Good performances let down by the rest of the film
","An excellent performance by Daniel Kaluuya really carries this film far beyond where it should be. Allison Williams also deserves a mention.Unfortunately, the rest of the film doesn't live up their standards.A distinctly average script and similar direction from Jordan Peele really scuppers the film, yet it has somehow garnered numerous award nominations and raked in a whole load of money from a tiny budget, so we'll definitely be hearing at lot more from Jordan Peele.It's one of those films that managed to get word of mouth right, but in the future it won't be regarded as well as it is now.Hopefully next time the budget will allow for a decent script doctor to whip it into shape.",6,0,1,21 February 2018
Drive," Dreadful plot devices. Decent actors being below par. A poor show.
","Some films rely on plot, script and characterisations. This is one.Unfortunately, the main plot elements are so totally shallow and unbelievable it seriously handicaps the movie. This, coupled with some wooden acting from the leads takes away any crutches it had.Ryan Gosling's character is a man of few words and we can at least thank the script for that. He tries to play a hard man, but sadly the only hard thing is the shockingly wooden delivery.The soundtrack at least deserves a mention, unfortunately not for good reasons. Some awful, totally out of place choices of music.Dreadful use of decent actors. I sometimes wonder if people simply give good reviews because they like a certain actor and not on the quality of the film. This seems a case in point. I really wonder what BAFTA was thinking.",4,2,4,14 September 2017
The Incredibles," Truly Outstanding
","My favourite animated film by far.
Smart, intelligent and just incredible fun on so many levels.",10,0,0,21 December 2018
Parasite," Outstanding piece of cinema
","Parasite thoroughly deserved the best picture Oscar and for once in a long time it's a winner that will be remembered as a classic. It's a master class in film making!Don't read reviews or a synopsis, just watch the magnificence unfold before your eyes.",10,1,5,1 March 2020
Wonder Woman," Clichéd, horrible 'comic relief' and mainly poor action with zero excitement.
","It's sad that so many obviously talented people contributed to this film considering it's so dire. The fact it's made so much money shows that poorly made teenager centric films obviously have a huge audience.The script is shockingly clichéd and poorly written with many characters that wouldn't be out of place in a below average Video Game ie terrible. Maybe that's intentional as many scenes resemble the cut-scenes in a video game, especially the 'bad guy's' scenes. That bodes badly for the future of cinema. The acting follows suit.Surprisingly for the budget, too many effects look fake and cheesy. Even the large city crowds fail to convince it's real.As for the fight choreography, it's American so expect more edits than punches. Except of course when it's full CGI complete with slow-mo. When will directors and editors learn!It's not all bad. There are the usual cgi influenced battles, which obviously talented people have worked on. They must however feel disappointed when the see their work in the completed movie.I love decent action films, unfortunately this isn't close to decent. Slow, clichéd, horrible 'comic relief' and mainly poor action with zero excitement. However, males who've just hit puberty will probably love it. After all, they've obviously voted in droves!",4,4,12,8 September 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Just dire
","Seriously, how do films like this get the Green Light? 
I'll answer my own question. To fleece the gullible teen market.A shocking premise and a big budget yields exactly what you'd expect. A total mess with decent CGI. What a waste of talent and a huge budget.The film is so bad it's not worth writing any more!",3,1,4,12 December 2017
