The Legend of Bagger Vance," The best movie ever
","I have seen this movie over a year ago. it was so inspiring, and now I want to buy it. Doy you know any location to buy this movie on DVD in Vancouver? I think this movie should have a rating of 10. Life is a game, it cannot be won, but only be played. This movie is not just about golf, it is about life. Struggles that Gagger had was not with his physical self, but with his mental self. Defeating yourself is a lot harder than defeating your enemy. I want to buy this movie because I missed the beginning one hour on TV. Please help guys! Thank you so much for all of your help. I would really appreciate that.",10,2,6,17 July 2005
