The Legend of Bagger Vance," Heart-warming and enjoyable, even to non-golfers
","Publicity pictures featuring the winning smiles of Will Smith, Matt Damon, and Robert Redford hunched over his laptop, were enough of an incentive for me to go see 'The Legend of Bagger Vance'. I'd refrained from reading about it, and so when it immediately became evident that the subject matter was golf, I almost regretted my choice. But then I recalled that I'd thoroughly enjoyed Tin Cup (also about golf), Field of Dreams (baseball), and Bull Durham (baseball). So I sat back, relaxed, and enjoyed. I don't think it's a good idea to tell the plot, and not because there's a mystery or surprise involved; but rather because the plot and the golf are there to celebrate the human spirit, determination, hope, love, and other such uplifting ideas. The 'legend' aspect of the movie is actually reminiscent of 'Field of Dreams'. Legends and romantic stories are supposed to make you feel better - and this is exactly what this film does. Oh, yes: and the opening scenes of Savannah, Georgia, look very much like those in 'Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil'. Which isn't a bad thing at all!  Who cares if the cinematography is almost 'too pretty', I get enough grim realism on TV.",7,0,1,11 November 2001
