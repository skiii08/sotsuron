Howl's Moving Castle," Deep story and wonderful images
","I was waiting and waiting for this movie to come out in US and finally did. I saw 4 times already, but try to go see it again. Because every time I watch this movie I find something new. It is like this movie have many layers and if you view this movie from different characters point of view, the story seems to offer something a bit different. (Sophie's point of view is the exactly the same as Howl, and if you watch the movie sympathizing to Sophie you will have a different perspective of the tale....it is not too easy to explain....but basically his characters have a life of its own and you can feel their emotions and reasons why they say or do things!) I think that is a magic of Miyazaki''s movie. He puts so much effort of developing the story line and it is not only one dimension, but all characters have their own. It may seem too much information and too rushing toward the end when I went to see it at first, but then once you (sort of) figure out the story, it is pretty natural that things happen that way. Like the world we live in all of us have different story to tell....His visual is simply stunning....it is amazing what he show us! All I can say is you should go to the theater to watch this movie to all people. It is worth watching it in the large screen!",10,4,6,29 June 2005
