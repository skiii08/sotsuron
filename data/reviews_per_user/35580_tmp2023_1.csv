Mission: Impossible III," worth seeing
","I saw this movie while stayed at Geneva, Switzerland. And I definitely liked it. Here I read that the film should be called Tom Cruise-Superman because a lot of things the main hero does are unreal. Yes, they are unreal but not more than unreal, they looks quite good and absolutely not stupid. All the special effects are perfect also. It was a very good idea to involve Tom's girlfriend in the action, it resulted in a lot of my emotions. The film produces emotions from the very beginning, human emotions I mean. They are not warm but it's very important to experience them also. And this is just great. I haven't seen MI1, I've just saw MI2, and the film is at least 10 times better than the previous one. The film definitely worth seeing.",8,0,0,31 December 2006
