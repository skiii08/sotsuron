Hereditary," IMDb users have the worst taste in horror movies
","I'm sitting in the movie waiting for 'this generations The Exorcist' and all I saw was the exact same plot as Paranormal Activity 3. An 8/10 for an extremely basic horror movie while original GOOD horror gets mediocre to low ratings. It had some good jump scares, the cast was great, just the story was super lame and unoriginal.",10,5,12,17 June 2018
Children of Men," what's so wonderful about this movie?
","OK, I was very interested in this movie and the plot and everything. The movie starts out very interesting but after about 45 minutes, I got very bored and very uninterested. The storyline was all over the place, the characters were hard to keep up with, and the movie was too fast-paced, after an hour i wasn't entirely sure what was going on. I am not a uneducated person, an ideal movie watch for me is not Soul Plane or Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle...but this movie was just unappealing to me. Maybe because I have a 6 month pregnant wife and it hit close too home, but that's a little far-fetched, it's not like I stopped having sex after watching Kids or never wanted to eat meat after watching Fast Food Nation, but this movie was just too much and too little at the same time. Please remember this is just an opinion and I don't care if you disagree with me.",2,2,5,26 March 2007
