Mission: Impossible III," Superb Action Movie
","MI III just might be the greatest action movie ever made, its certainly the best Mission Impossible film by far. It has the best villain, story and stunts, actually the stunts and action are out of this world. Tom Cruise is on the top of his game and is ably supported by the rest of the IMF team, especially Ving Rhames who is as great as ever. The film grips you with the opening scene and never lets up, if I had one small complaint it would be that I would have liked a bit more humour, but there was some funny lines between Cruise and Rhames. If you are going to only see one blockbuster film this year....... go and see Superman Returns if you are going to see two go and see this! I watched this last night and it was a great way to spend a Saturday night, I hope this breaks every box office record going. Nice one Tom.",9,0,2,7 May 2006
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Disappointing
","Although it looks amazing I found The Phantom Menace to be hugely disappointing, the story was poor and it just didn't feel like a Star Wars film. The best part by far was an amazing battle between Obi Wan Kenobi and Darth Maul. The worst by far was Jar Jar Binks, an awful, annoying, totally unfunny character. Ewen MacGregor was good as Obi Wan Kenobi but wasn't given much to do, Liam Neeson was very good also as was the child actor who played Anakin Skywalker. Natalie Portman wasn't so great though, showing little of the promise she showed in Leon. It was great to see R2D2 and C3PO again though and as you would expect the special effects were amazing including an astounding pod race sequence. Yoda was back too alongside Samuel L Jackson playing the part of a Jedi. I pray Episode II is better than this ***7/10*",7,9,13,5 May 2002
Ali," Disappointing
","It must have been really hard to make an average film out of the life story of the great man, but Michael Mann pulled it off. I learnt nothing new about Ali from this movie, I recommend you read a book on the man instead. His life story is incredible, but this film only concentrates on about a ten year period of his life, and its the usual flashy direction from Mann, and most of the time is filled by music videos it seemed to me. I will say this though Will Smith was as good as any actor could be playing Muhammed Ali, he is excellent, unfortunately he's in the wrong film. Very, very disappointing. Film- 5/10 Will Smith- 9/10",5,1,1,12 May 2002
The Ring," Superior Horror
","One of the best horror films of recent years, which isn't saying much when you think of the competition, but The Ring is a very good horror movie. Perhaps a little slow in places but with strong lead performances and a terrific basic idea, watch a video tape and seven days later you die...genius! I haven't seen the Japanese original but I don't think this version would have let it down. I went to see this at the pictures on a Saturday night after a few beers so I feel I really need to see this again at home on DVD. The film contains several jump out of your seat moments, proper ones, not the pathetic attempts to shock the audience in the likes of 'I still know what you did last summer', which actually shouldn't be mentioned in the same breath as films as classy as this one. The sequence with the horse on the ferry was the stand out moment for me, it was superb. I highly recommend this one.",7,1,1,8 April 2003
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Wonderful
","No film will ever effect me as much as E.T done. I was nine years old when I seen this in the cinema in 1982, it moved me so much its probably responsible for my love of cinema. I couldn't get enough of E.T after I watched it, E.T toys, E.T soap, E.T sweets etc etc, yes I know it was just a huge cash in, but I was just a kid not the sceptical 29 year old I am now! One reason this film grew to mythical status with me as well, was the fact that it took YEARS to come out on video, and when I did see it again, I was slightly disappointed because in my head I had built it up so much, and I never did get to see it on those legendary pirate copies that passed from kid to kid and workmate to workmate. Everyone must know the story by now, Alien gets deserted on earth and is befriended by young boy. The film is wonderfully made, the effects are amazing, the performers are brilliant, the music is fantastic, Spielbergs direction is genius...you may have noticed by now I liked this film! The scene where Elliot is cyling his bike through the woods with E.T, and they take off and fly over the tees is my all-time favourite scene in a movie bar none, and the music too.....awesome. Thanks Steven for that day in the cinema in 1982 that I will never forget, and I want to repeat with the 20th anniversary showing, and make me forget and forgive you for the awful British Telecom adverts you forced poor E.T to make in the UK ( why does Steven Spielberg risk spoiling a classic movie by allowing people to cash in and make crappy adverts using E.T????) does he really need the money. That would be like George Luca letting a cough sweet company use Darth Vader in their adverts ( oh i forgot he did ). Basically what Iwnted to say I still love this film. *** 10/10 ***",10,2,4,3 April 2002
Batman Returns," Its.....OK
","Batman Returns is pretty good but not great. I thought Catwoman was great but didn't care much for the Penquin, he was just too.....weird. Michelle Pfeiffer is fab as Catwoman and really seems to be getting her claws into the role. I think I prefer Batman films to have one villain, two seems a bit too much as Batman seems to fade into the background as so much time is given to the villains. I preferred Burgess Meridith as the Penquin in the 60's TV show anyway. Batman Returns must be the weirdest summer blockbuster ever released, still its miles better than any of the Batman films that followed. Michael Keaton is good when he's on screen as Batman which doesn't seem that much, he's the best Batman so far thats for sure. Christopher Walken is always good and he's no different here his character reminded me a little of when he played Max Zorin in the Bond movie 'A View to a Kill'. All in all not bad, but I don't think I'd bother watching it again. ***6/10***",6,1,2,11 January 2004
Troy," Pretty good
","Not quite as good as I expected it to be but definetely worth seeing. However I've never been a big Brad Pitt fan and this film done nothing to change my opinion of him. I suppose his female fans would have enjoyed his performance though as he spends most of film with little clothes on, being male I found the massive battle scenes more appealing and they WERE massive and superbly shot. Eric Bana was really good and stole the picture and Orlando Bloom was as usual completely awful. Wolfgang Petersen is a great director and he does a fine job here, I give it 7/10, if you hasn't seen it and want some Summer thrills wait until it comes out on DVD and see the much more entertaining The Day After Tomorrow or Van Helsing instead.",7,2,4,27 June 2004
The Day After Tomorrow," Perfect summer entertainment
","*** minor spoiler *** I loved every minute of this special effects laden disaster movie. I'm not a big fan of either Independance Day OR Godzilla, but all is forgiven because The Day After Tomorrow is a great film. Obviously the actors take second stage to the SFX but Dennis Quaid et al do a fine job. The Day After Tomorrow is probably the best disaster movie since The Posedion adventure, it has a good story and characters you actually care about. The highlight of the film for me was when New York ( where else ) gets hit by a tidal wave, or was it when the unsuspecting TV reporter gets to close to the tornadoes or when the RAF pilots in Scotland get more than a little chilly, hard to say The Day After Tomorrow is packed with great moments, I'm looking forward to the DVD. ***8/10***",8,1,2,27 June 2004
Sleepy Hollow," Great film
","I've never been a big fan of Tim Burton's films, so I didn't expect to enjoy Sleepy Hollow as much as I did. Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci are great in the lead parts, and the film looks amazing. I strongly recommend this film to everyone, even if like me Tim Burton's films have failed to bowl you over in the past.",8,0,0,10 November 2002
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Brilliant Western
","This is a fantastic western, starring two great actors Paul Newman and Robert Redford, complimented by a great performance by Katherine Ross. The highlight of the film for me was a fantastic chase sequence where Butch and Sundance are being hunted down by a relentess posse of men. The banter between the two leads is fantastic, the only minus point I would give this picture is the music, it was just odd, and didn't seem to fit the film, especially Raindrops keep falling on my head, ugh! Apart from that...an excellent film and one of my favourite westerns ***8/10***",8,4,9,2 May 2002
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Not as good as previous two
","While ROTJ is not as good as Star Wars and The Empire strikes back it is however still very enjoyable. It does though in my opinion feel like a lesser remake of the original, but with the added bonus of a fantastic light sabre battle between Luke and his father Darth Vader/Anakin Skywalker. This film is heavily centred on Luke so my favourite characer Han Solo seems to fade into the background, stuck in a rediculous battle with the Ewoks on Endor, including I kid you not a 'Tarzan yell' from Chewbacca! how did that get in there? Still this is Star Wars after all so there is more plus points than minuses, the plus points include a great space battle and an amazing speedbike chase. Also the emperor makes a great baddie, but the unmasking of Darth Vader was a mistake and I hate the way they got rid of Boba Fett. To be hones The Empire Strikes Back was always going to be hard to top and they couldn't quite pull it off ***7/10**",7,0,1,5 May 2002
The Expendables," Great action film
","As we all know The Expendables has an amazing cast of Action stars led by arguably the greatest action star of all time and if Stallone isn't that guy the other one makes a cameo appearance. Of course I'm talking about Arnold Schwarzenegger who makes a brief appearance with Bruce Willis in a scene many action fans never would have dreamt possible. My only problem with this movie is perhaps it has too many stars which means each one has too little time to make an impact. Jason Statham gets the most screen time bar Stallone and he is excellent, Jet Li has less impact but has a great fight with Dolph Lundgren who I have to say proves that he really should be on the big screen more often. Stone Cold Steve Austin also makes a fabulous bad guy and the rest of the team get brief chances to shine. Mickey Rourke also shows what an incredible actor he is even with less than stellar script to work from. Stallone really is truly back on top now and I hope that if Expendables 2 does happen he works a little more on the script and story. What truly saves this film is the astonishing last half hour or so of action and that is really what most of us turned up to see. Highly recommended for action fans. 8 out of 10",8,10,24,15 August 2010
Over the Top," Pretty Good Stallone Movie
","Over the Top isn't a bad film by any means but it isn't a particularly great one either. Its a strange mix of a film, Sly is trying to get to know his son from a former marriage, his ex-wife is dieing from cancer and his father in law is doing everything in his power to stop Sly getting custody of his son. Also there is a small matter of a an Arm Wrestling contest in Las Vegas to contend with. Its a hell of a lot better than it sounds to be fair, Sly has some touching moments with his son and the kid is played by a pretty good child actor who is a lot less annoying than most. Also as they journey across the USA in Slys truck some of the scenery is stunning. Its just a little hard to get excited about an Arm Wrestling contest though, couldn't they have had a more interesting sport like Pool or something? Still there is plenty of great 80's music to keep things flowing. This is certainly worth picking up on DVD if you get it for about five quid (like I did).",8,0,1,27 March 2007
Rocky II," Great sequel
","Sylvester Stallone reprises his role as the likeable Rocky Balboa in this knockout 1979 sequel. All the main characters return from the Oscar winning original and Stallone wrote this one too, plus he also DIRECTS it, and does a stunning job too, especially in the actual fight at the end. This was the last really dramatic Rocky film before the more entertainment/action route of Rocky III and Rocky IV, well thats not really true as Rocky V went back to the drama but sadly I think Rocky V is by far the worst of the series. Rocky II however is just great. Rocky gets married to Adrian but its not a smooth ride. An eye injury keeps Rocky out of the ring, but as he squanders his money, and Appollo pushes for a rematch will the Italion Stallion have to fight in the big rematch? You probably all know the answer to that but if you are lucky enough not to have watched these great films look out for the DVD box set and watch some of the most downright entertaining, moving and uplifting films of the 70's and 80's. Plus with the likes of George Foreman, Larry Holmes etc all returning to fight in their later years how about a Rocky VI Mr Stallone?",8,2,2,7 October 2002
The Color of Money," Not bad
","Not bad but I expect more from a Martin Scorcese film, maybe its unfair to expect a Goodfellas or Taxi Driver from every one of his films but when its got Paul Newman reprising his role from The Hustler plus Tom Cruise you can't help but expect a great movie. The Colour of Money isn't a great movie but it is a good one. People who spend the weekend in pubs playing Pool will especially enjoy it as it contains some great Pool scenes and trick shots apparently pulled off mainly by the actors involved. Paul Newman is really good in this film and shows Cruise a thing or two. Tom's character is pretty annoying to be honest, it would have been better if they had made him just a little likeable. Still there are a lot worse films to watch and if this one is on the telly I usually end up watching it. Although I find the ending very unsatisfying. ***6/10***",8,1,2,23 August 2003
North by Northwest," Classic Hitchcock
","This is a very entertaining Alfred Hitchcock film, it has all the twists and turns you would expect from the director and is great escapist fun. Cary Grant is pretty good in the lead role but personally I would have preferred James Stewart as I think his films with Hitchcock are superb especially Rear Window and my favourite Vertigo. Still thats a minor quibble as this is film is excellent in every other way, James Mason and Martin Landau are especially good as the bad guys and the music is excellent. This film also contains one of the finest scenes in cinematic history as Grant waits by a roadside apparently waiting to meet someone. Also the Bond films seem to have been heavily influenced by this film especially From Russia With Love. I highly recommend you get your hands on the DVD as I picked it up quite cheap and the picture quality and extras are superb ***9/10***",9,1,2,4 January 2004
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," He's back....and its great.
","When I first heard that Terminator 3 was on the way I had mixed feelings, I was worried that Arnie couldn't deliver a worthy follow up to the previous two Terminator films without James Cameron, I needn't have worried, Terminator 3 is fantastic. In my opininion its the second best of the series, second only to the original, and better than T2. I always felt that T2 was nowhere nearly as good as the original, but the amazing special effects blinded everyone to the fact. In T3 it is an absolute Joy to see Arnold back in his most famous role, he's absolutely fantastic in this film. He looks great too, he's obviously been back in the gym for this one. Director Jonathon Mostow does a great job filling Camerons shoes and the supporting cast are great, the actor playing John Connor is much more likeable than whiney Ed Norton, and Claire Danes gets better and better as the film progresses, but all in all this film belongs to Arnold, the only down point for me was the lack of the familiar Terminator music from the last two films, anyway welcome back Arnie, roll on T4.",8,1,1,1 August 2003
Van Helsing," Good, fun summer blockbuster
","I am really quite surprised how many IMDB users disliked Van Helsing. I really enjoyed it, ok it really is daft but I never expected anything less than what I got. Firstly I'm not a huge fan of CGI and to be honest I was getting rather tired of it but Van Helsing looks absolutely stunning. I loved the design of the whole film, the sets and landscapes were amazing. Also the special effects were fabulous. Hugh Jackman could have done with been given a little depth to his character but he was great as Van Helsing as was his sidekick who was very funny in his role as the Friar. I'm not so sure about Kate Beckinsales acting ability but she looks absolutely beautiful anyway. I did find the actor portraying Count Dracula a little OTT even for this film though!, Frankensteins Monster was better represented in the acting stakes. I'm no expert on the old Universal monster movies being Scottish I was brought up on the Hammer Horror films with the likes of Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee and have always loved a good horror film. Thats why I give Van Helsing a huge thumbs up but still hope for a better plot and storyline if there is a sequel but i can't fault the superb special effects and acton sequences. Great popcorn flick ***7/10***",7,0,0,12 May 2004
Rocky IV," A guilty pleasure
","Ok on the whole this film is very silly and a million miles away from the realism of the original Oscar winning original, but if you are in the mood for comic strip non-stop action, then Rocky IV is hard to beat. Credit to Sylvester Stallone in 1985 he certainly knew what his fans wanted and this film was one of the biggest money earners of the year alongwith his other film of that year Rambo First Blood Part II. As in Rocky III, Stallone kills off one of the major characters in the series as Appollo Creed is killed fighting Russian fighting machine Ivan Drago in a superbly staged fight, and this sets up a grudge match between the Soviet and our hero Rocky Balboa...in Russia! Which is the perfect set up for an utterly fantastic training sequence (in my opinion the best of the five films) as Rocky trains in the mountains, chopping logs, climbing mountains (!) as Drago trains in a state of the art space-age training gym, boosted by performance enhancing drugs. Its the good old USA v The Soviet Union, who needs a nuclear war when you can settle your diffrences in the ring. This part dates Rocky IV badly, and to be honest the sheer anti-communist feel of the film sits uneasily in the Rocky series, also one of the best things of the films was Rockys easy going, likeable personality, but after Appolos death he's more like Rambo than Rocky. The fight at the end is spectacular and they obviously had mre money to spend on this one. Also I must mention this film has a great 80's soundtrack too, and there is a great sequence that shows clips of all the previous films. I still really enjoy this film and i give it a hard hitting ***7/10***, ignore Rocky V though, it tried to recapture the feeling of the original and failed miserably.",9,1,2,28 April 2002
Spider-Man," At last a Spider-Man movie!
","Spider-Man the Movie seems to have taken forever to hit the big screen, but it was worth the wait as Sam Raimi has delivered a great film, with great performances by Tobey Maguire and the beautiful Kirsten Dunst. I even remember the cheesy 70's TV series of Spiderman, but this one does the web slinger much more justice with state of the art special effects that look truly amazing, but the film is much more than just eye candy, it has soul too. I still think Superman the Movie is the best comic book adaption ever made but this is a very close second. Perhaps its unfair to compare the two characters though, because Spider-Man is human whilst Superman  isn't, plus Superman was from the childhood and holds a special place in my heart, I watched Spider-Man as an adult and thoroughly enjoyed it, I think the vast army of fans haven't been let down. ***9/10***",9,0,0,25 May 2002
Aliens," Superb action film
","Maybe the most exciting and amazing action film ever, and easily the best in the Alien series. James Cameron really did show what a great director he is with this film. Ignore the next two films though, they are not worthy to be mentioned in the same sentence as this one. ***9/10** p.s Try and see the Special Edition version of the film, it adds scenes that make the film even better than the original theatrical release.",9,0,0,23 April 2002
Ocean's Eleven," In alphabetical order
","There hasn't been this many stars in a film for years, or if there has I haven't seen it. Its like a throwback to those 70's disaster films. George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, Andy Garcia, Matt Damon etc all in the same film! It doesn't disappoint, its an enjoyable caper, where George Clooney gets together a squad of crooks to steal over 160 million dollars from a three casinos in Las Vegas, except there is a bit more to it than that as the owner of the casinos (Andy Garcia) is sleeping with his ex-wife (Julia Roberts). All the stars are on good form, and its a great way to spend a couple of hours. Recommended ***7/10***",7,0,1,26 May 2002
Die Hard 2," Not as good as Die Hard....still great.
","OK Die Hard 2: Die Harder isn't as good as Die Hard, but Die Hard is arguably the greatest action movie ever made. Die Hard 2 is still however a very good action movie, Harlin can be a great action director he proved that here and in some of his other movies like Cliffhanger. Bruce Willis is still on top of his game here before his career nose dived into rubbish like Hudson Hawk and North. The movie has a great wintery, cold feel to it and some of the action sequences are superb, also Harlin doesn't hang about the movie starts with a bang and never lets up, although Die Hard built the tension up slowly which makes for a better movie in the long run. Willis has some great one liners and the villains are pretty evil, don't watch this is your going on a flight in the near future! Even though I think this is the lesser of the three Die Hard movies I still think its great which shows the high quality of the series. ***7/10***",8,0,3,5 September 2004
Alien vs. Predator," Alien Vs Predator
","*** Contains Spoilers *** I'm not sure exactly what to say about this film, I found parts of it to be very enjoyable and some parts annoying. The good bits... well its Aliens V Predators isn't it, how cool is that! Seeing them battle on screen is fantastic and the action sequences are superb with terrific set design and special effects. The bad bits.... I feel they rushed into the battle a little quickly and apart from the main female actress I cared very little for the humans. Also was Ewen Bremner who was great in Trainspotting deliberately acting that bad?, the Italian actor and the lead female actress were thankfully very good though. Lance Henrikson was great and with him being in the movie it tied up all the movies very nicely, lots of little in jokes for fans of the Alien movies to enjoy spotting. The biggest problem with this movie is the fact that its not an 18 certificate so the director couldn't up the gore level and make the film more frightening and nasty, which an Alien and Predator movie should be, this is just the movie company wanted to get the kids in the cinema so the film can make more money. If they release an uncut version on DVD I would certainly buy it, though why I should have to wait for it is slightly annoying. Also the movie is very dark so sometimes its a little hard to see whats going on, which certainly wasn't a problem in Predator for instance which was set in the Jungle. The movie is well directed by British director Paul WS Anderson who made the great Event Horizon and the absolutely terrible Resident Evil. AVP is a much better movie than Resident Evil thankfully and if you go into the cinema wanting a fun movie you won't be disappointed, but you will be if you expect it to be as good as Alien, Aliens or Predator. However its better than Alien 3, Alien Resurrection and Predator 2. It also sets itself up for sequel ( what a surprise! ). *** 7/10 ***",7,0,0,11 September 2004
Tigerland," Very good
","This Vietnam film concentrates on the young soldiers who are sent to Tigerland a hellish training ground which is their last preparation before being sent to Nam. It mainly concentrates on Boz, a young man who is desperate to find any way out of going to war ***SPOILER*** but never manages it, however he does seem to be able to get some of his buddies out. ***END OF SPOILER***The acting in this film is excellent, special mention to Irishman Colin Farrel he really does seem to be a star of the future, though the acting is excellent right across the board. I would love to see a follow up to this film which follows Boz when he gets to Vietnam, I doubt it though. I can't believe this film was directed by the same man that brought us Batman and Robin, I can forgive him for that awful film now, because this was excellent. ***7/10***",7,0,0,30 April 2002
Days of Thunder," I feel the need, the need for Speed
","The producers, director and star of Top Gun get together again for this above average racing drama. Its nowhere near as good as Top Gun of course but its no disaster. Tom Cruise is good as the daftly named racing driver Cole Trickle and the ever reliable Robert Duvall offers classy support. Michael Rooker is excellent as Toms rival and Randy Quaid shows a more serious side to those who only know him from the Vacation movies. Surprisingly the usually good Nicole Kidman is rather bland as the love interest although to be fair she's not given a heck of a lot to work with. The music is of course all important in a movie like this and it has a pretty good soundtrack including Maria McKee's Number One hit Show Me Heaven, but again Top Gun had a much better soundtrack with Hans Zimmmer no match for Harold Faltermeyer. Tony Scott directs with his usual style, if you have seen Top Gun or Beverly Hills Cop 2 you'll no what to expect, very flashy and VERY LOUD. With a slightly less predictable story this could have been a lot better but as it is its a pretty enjoyable way to pass a couple of hours.",6,26,31,12 February 2007
Hero," Astounding dream like film
","This film is amazing, it is beautiful and it really does knock anything Hollywood can do for six. Jet Li doesn't get the respect he deserves in Hollywood, he deserves much better American films than the likes of Romeo Must Die and The One. He has amazing screen presence in Hero and is an amazing martial artist. Some of the scenes, like the fight over the lake are amazing, its like watching a dream. The story can be slightly confusing, well to me anyway but is well worth the effort. I hope Jet Li can follow this up, but it is a hard act to follow. Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung offer classy support and Jet Li even gets a rematch with Donnie Yen in Hero. If you liked Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon I highly recommend this film.",8,0,0,30 August 2005
Meet Joe Black," Awful
","This film is rubbish, utter rubbish. As for Hopkins I must be missing something, to me he is an awful actor, constantly playing the same role, in this and films like The Edge, OK he was the second best Hannibal Lector but that was 12 years ago, he's a rubbishy Welsh actor in my opinion. As for Brad Pitt, well I'm neither female or under 14 so of course i realise he can only play two roles, sub Jack Nicholson mad or boringly bland, in the latter he's probably just playing himself. Claire Forlani is beautiful but I'm never seen anyone overact so much since that actress who played Sue Ellen in Dallas. To think this director made Beverly Hills Cop and Midnight Run, looks like he has disappeared up his own ****.",3,1,3,13 September 2003
Men in Black," Good movie
","I did say good movie, I wouldn't say 'great' movie. I always thought this film was slightly overrated in 1997. It is however quite an enjoyable way to spend ninety minutes, Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones make a good pairing and the special effects are great. There are more original ideas in this film than most summer blockbusters and it reminded me of one of my all time favourite films 'Ghostbusters'. I don't think I'll bother with the follow up judging by the reviews. No surprise there though sequels rarely match the original do they?",Null,0,0,7 April 2003
Victory," Football movie meets The Great Escape
","*** MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS *** I loved this film as a kid. Football was and still is a major part of my life, as is movies. Also I was a huge Stallone fan after the Rocky movies came out and was intrigued to see such a huge american star in a football movie! Also Pele was in it too! one of the greatest footballers the world has ever seen, in my opinion the second greatest after Diego Maradona. Michcael Caine appears too as the most unconvincing footballer ever and the rest is filled out by real footballers, actually Ipswich Towns early 80's team fact fans, including Scotlands John Wark who has one line in the movie and they dubbed it! There is a lot of fun to be made from watching this film, I still hold a place in my heart for it, what other WWII film has people wearing white trainers and flares whilst sporting long 70's haircuts I ask you? Classic so bad its good movie *** 7/10 ***",7,2,2,30 May 2004
Rocky," Classic
","Rocky is not only by far the best of the series it is also in my opinion one of the greatest movies of all time. Sylvester Stallone is amazing in this. Add the fact he wrote the movie and you can see he deserves his superstar status. Ten years later he was doing stuff like Cobra but never mind! Rocky is as they say a true underdog story, a boxing story and above all a love story between Rocky and a shy pet shop worker called Adrian. Also a friendship between him and Adrians brother Paulie, a bitter man with a chip on his shoulder but a good guy underneath. Also Boxing trainer Mickey played by a superb Burgess Meridith and World Champion Appolo Creed played by the under-rated Carl Weathers. All the ingredients make this an amazingly uplifting movie. Praise to Bill Conti too for producing the now very familiar music, although there is very little of it at the beginning only when Rocky starts to train for the big fight. The film has so may memorable images, especially when Rocky runs up the steps in Philadelphia. Also loads of endlessly quotable lines, many of which are very funny. On a final note, one thing I have noticed about the Rocky movies, Rockys career seems to run very close to Stallones in as such if Rocky is on top of his career then so is Stallone in Hollywood. Rocky II is similar to this but III and IV are just pure entertainment and V tries to get back to the style of this one. Rocky Balboa (out at the end of 2006) will have to be some movie to come close to this one thats for sure.",10,0,0,3 September 2006
The Descent," Two in a row from Marshall
","The Director Neil Marshall has done it again, after the excellent Dog Soldiers he has again shown the Americans how to make a great horror film. The Descent is a very clever film, it builds up the tension slowly then unleashes all hell on the viewer. It is a very jumpy film! and has a good storyline that will have you thinking long after you have left the cinema. It is probably the best horror film I have seen since .... well since Dog Soldiers! Marshall seems to have had a bigger budget to work with Descent and he puts it to very good use, the Crawlers are very well done without being too OTT. My one small complaint is although the darkness of the underground caves serves to up the tension in the film it is however hard to follow some of the action. I had a similar complaint about Alien V Predator but this film is far superior to that one. You may think thats not saying much but I think AVP was very harshly treated by the critics, but I do wonder what Marshall could do with an Alien film or a Predator movie. Has Stallone got a director for Rambo IV yet? This man could do the job! Is it better than Dog Soldiers? I'll call it a draw. Roll on the next one, a World War II movie? That would be great.",7,0,1,6 August 2005
Rocky III," Great Entertainment
","Rocky III is great entertainment. Its less serious than the previous two, as Sylvester Stallone packs as much action as he can into its running time. This time Rocky is defeated in the ring by Clubber Lang played by Mr T who went onto greater fame in TV's The A team and Rocky has to get 'The Eye of the Tiger' back to take him on again in a rematch. Without his beloved trainer Mickey who dies of a heart attack in a touching scene in his dressing room after his defeat. Appollo Creed now trains Rocky in an interesting twist as they were opponents in the first two films. This leads to the usual training sequence and massive fight at the end of the film. All in all a great film and a massive hit when it was released in 1982. It also contains the No 1 hit 'Eye of the Tiger' by Survivor. A great Rocky film, and in my opinion it was even bettered by the next Rocky film, Rocky IV of course!",9,1,3,28 April 2002
The Matrix Reloaded," Who cares? This is rubbish
","I loved The Marix but this follow up is totally contrived and has been way too long coming. Everything Matrix is now really boring, and is it just me but isn't CGI really unimpressive and just annoying, like whoa look what they can do with a computer now! Whatever, The Matrix Reloaded is a load of self important rubbish. I would rather watch a Bruce Lee film than watch Keanu Reeves spin around on wires in front of a blue screen. Yawn. Oh god there is another Matrix film out this year, great, more endless adverts, computer games and mobile phone tie ins.",1,3,4,13 September 2003
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Superb
","The third Die Hard film continues the trend of the first two and delivers a no-stop rollercoaster ride of thrills and spills. Bruce Willis is great in his signature role of John McLane, the director of the original Die Hard is back on board PLUS Samuel L. Jackson co stars in this one! The story is great too plus using the whole of New York instead of using the confines of a skyscraper or airport makes a nice change from the previous two. I'd rate this the second best of the series so far (with Die Hard 4 on the way), just a notch below the original, but considering this is the third film of a series this film really delivers. A lot of film series have a disappointing third parts e.g Lethal Weapon III, Godfather Part III, Return of the Jedi, Superman III, Rambo III etc etc, but this one bucks the trend, roll on Die Hard 4!",8,0,0,20 May 2003
Jaws," Superb
","Jaws is one of the greatest films ever made. Steven Spielberg created a masterpiece with Jaws aided by one of the best scores ever written, John Williams music to Jaws is probably the best known film theme ever. I watch this film regularly and I never tire of it, if you haven't seen it, I envy you. ***10/10***",10,2,4,28 April 2002
The Cannonball Run," Very silly, but fun movie.
","The Cannonball Run is basically the movie version of that old classic cartoon 'Wacky Races'. Its packed with stars, Burt Reynolds, Roger Moore, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis JR, Farrah Fawcett and even Jackie Chan! Its fun to watch but little or no effort has been made in trying to put some kind of plot into the film. Roger Moore sends up his James Bond character so much I'm surprised the Broccoli's let him make another one! He even drives around in the Aston Martin from Goldfinger which was a Sean Connery Bond film! It would have made more sense to have him drive the Lotus Esprit from The Spy Who Loved Me, but then I'm probably putting more thought into the film than they were. This was Jackie Chans first American film, in an interview I seen him do once he complained that they never let him bring any of his own stunt guys over from Hong Kong to make the fights faster, plus they made him fight on sand which he says makes it much harder to stage some impressive action.As for Burt Reynolds he's simply coasting along, just being well...himself really, this was probaby one of his last major hit films, if you want to see what a terrific actor he can be check out 'Deliverance'.The car stunts are pretty good though and Dean Martin and Sammy Davis JR make a very funny pair, Jack Elam's brilliant as a mad Doctor. Plus Farrah Fawcett and Adrien Barbeau look fantastic! So my advice is get a few beers in and switch your brain off if you want to enjoy this movie. *5/10*",Null,0,1,8 April 2003
Back to the Future Part II," They shouldn't have come back
","*Mild Spoilers* I couldn't wait to see this one in the cinema in 1989. I loved the original and watched it countless times on video. Anyone who watched the original knew that they were going to do a sequel when 'To be continued' flashed up on the screen, great I thought, not only had I just watched a fantastic film they were going to do another! So I awaited the follow up with much excitement, it took quite a while as it didn't appear until four years later but this didn't seem so bad when I found out they were actually making two Back to the Future follow ups at the same time. The minute the film started doubts began to enter my mind, for a start the actress playing Marty's girlfriend was different so they had to reshoot the ending of the last one, then the old actors playing multiple roles trick appeared, with actors playing themselves older, younger, their sons, their fathers, their mothers, their alternate selves etc etc, very clever, or so they think, I personally didn't want to see Michael J Fox in drag playing his daughter, or finding out he was a complete loser in the future with a complete idiot of a son, what a downer. Also most of the film seems to be just commercials for various products, Texaco, Mattel, Nintendo and most blatantly Pepsi, the worst part was when Doc actually orders Marty to 'order a Pepsi', I half expected him to say 'and remember folks you can order a Pepsi from the foyer, too!', actually this movie must have the most product placement in any film even more than the James Bond films, although I do realise there was some in the brilliant original too. I will say that there was some very clever time travel stuff going on though, going back to 1955 'again!' was a brilliant idea, I enjoyed this section much more than the horrible 2015 section. At least the producers tried to make a decent follow up actually if anything they appear to be trying too hard. Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd are very good in reprising their best known roles and so are the supporting cast. Elisabeth Shue doesn't fare so well, appearing in a very dodgy wig and for most of the film the makers don't seem to know what to do with her character, so she spends most of the film getting knocked out or fainting so they don't have to bother with her anymore. All in all while not being a complete disaster Back to the Future was none the less a major disappointment. ***6/10***",6,1,3,10 August 2003
Signs," Well?
","I'm not sure about this film at all, yes it was well directed, and Gibson and co were fine, but I was disappointed with this film when I left the cinema about an hour ago. To say why I was disappointed would need me to reveal to much of the storyline, and since this film has only been in the country for 3 days I can't do that. What I will say is the trailers on TV for this are in my opinion VERY misleading. I notice in some magazines the director of this film is being compared to Steven Spielberg, well I noticed something he done in this film that was very similar to Spielberg, there is a section in the film when Mel's character is flicking through a book about Aliens, and the audience has the chance to see the pictures in the book, this reminded me of the part in Jaws when Roy Scheider is flicking through a book about sharks, which was a clever way of showing what could be about to happen. This film is a long way short of films of the class of Jaws or Close encounters though... a long way off.",6,0,1,15 September 2002
The Deer Hunter," De Niro at his peak
","The Deer Hunter is a very powerful and haunting film, with images and scenes that will stay with you long after you have finished watching it. Robert De Niro puts in arguably his finest performance. This was made at a time when he wouldn't appear in just any old film, and he seemed to have a knack of picking classic films to appear in. It would be unfair to expect every role an actor played to be a classic, but to be honest the Robert De Niro of today seems a million miles away rom the Robert De Niro that appears in The Deer Hunter. Everyone thinks of the Russian roulette scene when they think of this film, and its probably be mentioned in most of the comments here, but I don't think I've seen a more powerful, amazing and realistic performance than what De Niro does in this scene, he's quite simply bloody fantastic, what an actor. Also of course this wasn't a one man show, Christopher Walken deservedly won an oscar for his role here. Meryl Streep is brilliant, actually the whole cast are. Sadly this was John Cazale's last perforance, he died shortly after filming, at least he left us with this last great appearance in film. The director Michael Cimino made an amazing film here and its baffling he's never come close to making a decent film since. Robert De Niro, you're simply the best. *** 10/10 ***",10,0,0,28 March 2002
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," I love this film!
","I don't really think I can add anything new to what has already ben said about this film, but anyway...Star Wars is an amazing film, I have watched it countless times and never tire of it. The story was superb, the actors were all great in their roles, especially Harrison Ford who excels in his role as Han Solo. R2D2, C3PO and Chewbacca were all wonderful creations, and the special effects were amazing considering this film was made in 1977. The most amazing thing is the follow up The Empire Strikes back was even better! This film deserved the astounding success it gained ***9/10***",9,0,0,5 May 2002
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Best Star Wars Film SO FAR!
","In my opinion this is the best Star Wars film so far, darker than Star Wars and Return of the Jedi, it also boasts even more jaw dropping effects than the original. Also Harrison Ford, Mark Hammil and Carrie Fisher are more comfortable in their roles, probably because they are more confident in this films quality than the first one, because they seen the outcome of Star Wars finished product. I love this film and I hope Episode 2 Attack of the Clones can top it (fingers crossed!). Billy Dee Williams role also makes a great addition to the cast, oh and of course Boba Fett first appears in this one, and that character is the coolest of all the Star Wars characters, ***SPOILER*** just a pity he was killed so cheaply in Return of the Jedi. Maybe Star Wars films are better off when Lucas himself doesn't direct them?, I hope not what with as I write this less than a month from Episode 2. Time will tell...I give this ***10.10*** as I can't falt it in any way.",10,0,1,23 April 2002
Donnie Darko," Great film
","Fantastic movie, weird and wonderful. Great lead performances and some brilliant 80's pop music in the soundtrack by the likes of Tears for Fears and Echo and the Bunnymen. Donnie Darko is one of the best films I've seen in recent years, I look forward to the Directors next film. One of the best endings to a film I've ever seen too. I spotted a couple of nods to other films too, most notably ET, so the director has good taste in films too. If you like films like The Sixth Sense, Signs and Fearless you'll love Donnie Darko. Highly recommended ***8/10***",8,1,2,31 August 2003
Back to the Future," Timeless
","Back to the Future was without a shadow of a doubt one of the best films of the 1980's, everything about it is just so great, the story, the acting, the music and the special effects. It was a huge hit in 1985 and I caught it on video soon after, it was the most entertaining and feel good movie I had seen up to that point. Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd got the roles of their life in this film and Crispin Glover and Lea Thompson are great too. The whole time travel concept is brilliantly realised, the great thing about time travel is that it gives the film-makers many oppurtunities to insert some clever in jokes into the movie and they do that a lot in BTTF. They promised follow up at the end of the movie arrived four years later, which interestingly was filmed at the same time as Part III. Although they were enjoyable enough I couldn't help but be disappointed by them, neither had the magic of this one unfortunately. ***9/10***",9,1,2,10 August 2003
