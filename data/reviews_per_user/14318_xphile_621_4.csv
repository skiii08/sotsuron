The Ring," I have not seen a film this frightening since 'The Exorcist'
","'The Ring' may be the most horrifying movie I've ever seen.  It had a pretty well-written script, great acting, a fast-moving, intense plot, and was an all-around awesome movie.  I saw a screening of this on Thursday night at 1 in the morning which made it all the scarier.  Upon returning to my house I had an urge to unplug my television set and phone.  Everyone in the theater agreed that it was going to keep them up all night.  Perhaps 'The Ring' may even be scarier than 'The Exorcist' or 'Rosemary's Baby'.  Definately don't miss this one.  5 out of 5 stars.  A+",10,0,0,18 October 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Okay, 2 out of 5 stars
","I didn't really enjoy this film very much.  It was WAY too long.  3 hours for the first of three parts of a trilogy.  If the rest are the same, it's basically a nine hour movie.  Maybe if it actually had an ending and was more like 2-2 1/2 hours, I would've like it.",1,3,11,1 April 2002
Identity," Filled with good twists and a great ending
","Identity is good at keeping you on the edge of your seat ready for a good jump, but then it never seems to come.  The kind of weak attempts at 'jumps' are few and far between, but the movie keeps you interested so it all works out.  A lot of the plot points were predictable, but the last five minutes of the movie will literally drop your jaw.  John Cusack and Amanda Peet shine in this movie, though it is not Ray Liotta's best performance.  Clea DuVall(who was in The Faculty and Girl, Interrupted)'s acting was unbelieveable.  She played her character very well and believably. Identity is more of a mystery/thriller than horror film.  It was quite a good movie, but not necessarily scary at all.  9/10!",9,0,0,25 April 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," This film soared way beyond my expectations
","I have never been a diehard fan of the Lord of the Rings series.  I attempted reading the novels but did not have the time to finish them.  When the first of these three movies arrived in theaters I was told how amazing these films would be.  When i discovered 'Fellowship' was over three hours I was ready for a painful experience.  I will be honest: I fell asleep.  The next week I was talked into giving it another chance.  I absolutely loved it.  I eagerly awaited the extended edition which I watched in one sitting. When 'The Two Towers' arrived my expectations were unfortunately too high. I enjoyed TTT, but it felt to me like it was missing something that was in the first film.      I still remained excited for 'The Return of the King' to arrive, but I figured it could never beat 'Fellowship'.  Boy was I wrong.  I heard many reviews and people said what a great film it was, so I began to get excited for the release.  I saw it last night with higher expectations that i had for the second film.  The expectations I had for this film were higher that what I have had for probably any film I have seen in recent years.  This movie blew my expectations away.  I was shocked by how well this trilogy wound down and concluded.  Peter Jackson's directing really shined through in this one and the acting was superb.      This film had BETTER win best picture or I will lose all respect for the Academy Awards (not that i had a whole lot).  Even non-LOTR fans can thoroughly enjoy this film.  This trilogy FAR outdoes the Matrix trilogy and makes Matrix Revolutions look like one of the worst films ever made (not that it took a lot to do that).  Granted, this film was extremely long, but it is destined to become a classic and I know I will be getting that extended edition in November 2004.  A+",10,0,1,18 December 2003
