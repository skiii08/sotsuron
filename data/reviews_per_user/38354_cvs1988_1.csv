Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Worst Movie of the Year
","There are movies that if they were human would be a strong argument for birth control; needless to say, this is one of those movies. This movie is nothing more than a $70million substitute for water-boarding. The dismal plot of the movie comes across as a cruel experiment by Hollywood to discover how poor of a script they can produce if they simply disguise it with an endless series of CGI action sequences and slow bullet time effects. I have seen Playstation games with less CGI than this movie displays. The bullet time effects are only appreciated because they provide longer relief from the banal acting than if they did the same scene in real time. The intended grotesque and gritty vampires come across as silly and comedic making Bella from Twilight comparatively seem frightening. The only mentally engaging aspect of this movie is trying to figure out how this movie was ever allowed to be made. Otherwise, my mind is more lifeless than the vampires from beginning to end. I went into the movie without having high expectations, yet I still left with an overwhelming feeling that I had just squandered two hours of my life with this abuse of my intelligence.",1,17,63,20 June 2012
