Walk the Line," Simple Formula
","I just saw this film today and found it to be slightly disappointing. I live in London where the films are at least two to three months behind and each trip back for Thanksgiving means I get ahead of the game a little in terms of films I am excited to see. Plus the price of a movie ticket here in the USA is far more manageable (at least $14 per person).This film was on my must see list and as the opening sequence rolled on starting with the major milestone of the subject and then fading into a traumatic event that shapes the future I knew what was coming almost every step despite knowing next to nothing about 'The Man in Black'.The comparisons to 'Ray' are the most obvious. Both singers lost a brother during the early formative years and then went on to produce ground shattering new forms of popular music while suffering the pangs of a family destroying substance addiction. Unfortunately, Walk the Line does not seem to delve too deeply into the unpleasantness that a drug problem can be. Skimming scenes of a few pills and a desperation for them and then the standard children crying as the parents fight felt forced, like a paint by numbers Picasso.I felt all this detracted from wonderful, singular performances from the two leads who both have an incredible talent for mimicry. If this entire film had been nothing but a string of concert performances; I would have been thoroughly entertained. The relationships between those performers (including that of Cash with his standard issue unfeeling father) felt slathered on for the pulling of heart strings. What must have been a tortured and deeply loving relationship between June Carter and Johnny Cash felt cheapened and commercial.Since bio pics seem to be all the rage these days, there must have been a lot of crowd pleasing to do. The public who, like me, might not be too familiar with the talent of Carter and Cash. Then there are the people who knew or were related to them. I have heard grumblings that the first wife of Cash was not accurately portrayed but again cheapened to look like a harpy. What woman wouldn't be upset that her husband was a cheating drug addict? Last of all there are the fans. Rabid or devoted, they obviously feel a connection through the powerful music of a legend. Too many masters does not a personable film make.All in all this film features two truly gifted actors trying to reach the audience with hollow material. They do this best through the amazing music they perform live each take (so it is said) but when it comes to dialog, the movie feel flat. With a questionable ending leaving the viewer confused and unfulfilled, I can not honestly tell anyone this is a experience that should be had by all who enjoy good film. Nor can I tell them to avoid it. The music makes this worth a look but possibly at home with a remote with a fast forward button.",7,1,3,21 November 2005
