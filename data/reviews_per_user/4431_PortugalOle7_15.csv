The Benchwarmers," Revenge of the Nerds, baseball-style.
","Grownup nerds Schneider, Spade, and Heder decide to get their revenge on growing up being bullied by forming a three-man baseball team that must compete in a tournament against little-leaguers.It has some laughs but it becomes very tired. Jon Heder seems to be playing the same nerd in this film as he did in Napoleon Dynamite. Spade provides some of his patented one-liners. Also provides some cameos from ESPN personalities Dan Patrick and Sean Salisbury.It certainly provides some stupid humor, as you would expect from the same comedy minds that brought you Happy Gilmore and Big Daddy. However, it seems to use up all its good material in the first half of the film.",5,0,0,28 February 2007
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Hilarious for those with an open mind.
","I'm not a big Ali G or Borat fan. Not that I don't think Cohen's characters are funny, I just don't watch the shows. That being said you don't have to be an avid fan to enjoy this film.Sacha Baron Cohen's Borat is a man from Kazakhstan who decides to travel to America to find out about our 'cultural learnings', and in the process insults many unaware Americans with his own.What is ironic about this film is that on more than one occasion Borat encounters Americans who are almost as culturally bias/racist as he is. As an actor who is totally in control of his character, Cohen never breaks from Borat in situations he easily could have. Whether he is riding around in an ice cream truck with a bear hanging out the window or meeting with a feminist group, Borat is hysterical.",8,2,9,18 November 2006
The Big Lebowski," White Russians, a Dude, and Bowling!
","So a broke stoner/bowling lover wants revenge against hoodlums who mistakingly urinate on his living room carpet. Let the games begin! Bridges stars as 'The Dude' Lebowski who enlists the help of his friend, ex-Vietnam vet Walter (Goodman) to exact revenge against a wealthy businessman with the same namesake. It turns out he gets way more than he bargained for; agreeing to find the millionaire's young wife, who has gone missing. It turns out he is not the only one looking for this woman or the ransom money. The Dude encounters an eccentric cast of characters, from the millionaire's daughter (Moore) to a gang of German Nihilists (including Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea).The story is extremely wacky which lead to lots of hilarity in some scenes. The best part is that the film never takes itself seriously, its more of a dark comedy than anything else. The glue of the film for me is the great pairing of Bridges and Goodman. Goodman's character constantly looks to associate every situation with the Vietnam war. Bridges is brilliant because of his laid-back appearance, including a robe and sandals.However the story seems to hit a few snags along the way and for me makes the film far from perfect. These snags for me are segments that seem to make the film drag a bit, time-wise. There seem to be too many characters that pop-up and then we are forced to revisit them later in the film.In conclusion, its a great dark comedy that doesn't follow conventional plot lines, a Cohen brothers trademark. It's worth watching for the scenes with Goodman and Bridges alone.",7,0,2,13 February 2007
The Bodyguard," Costner and Houston's chemistry save a bland plot
","A movie/music star who needs protection from a psychotic fan, wow what a concept. And who better to play it than Whitney Houston, a stretch I know.The plot is totally disappointing and bland. Luckily the on-screen romance and chemistry from Houston and Costner, along with a great soundtrack, save this film from being a total bust. The love story between Costner and Houston becomes the main driving force, preventing the film from running out of ideas. In the end the romance is what you take away from the film, not the convoluted mystery plot.It's enjoyable in the end and I would recommend it. Of course the soundtrack is one of the best and most popular in history with 'I Will Always Love You', 'Run to You', 'I Have Nothing', and 'I'm Every Woman.'",6,21,35,7 October 2006
Pan's Labyrinth," One of the best of 06'; truly magical!
","I had not heard much about this film before going to see it. Word of mouth was it was fascinating and it was hailed as one of the top films of 2006. I can say that not only is it one of the best, but probably the best.The film tells the story of a young girl named Ofelia, who goes to live with her pregnant mother in the countryside home of a Spanish Captain, who her mother has recently married. The Captain is a cruel man who wants little to do with Ofelia and her mother, but directs more attention to the unborn child. Going on around them is the fascist rebellion of the 1940s. To cope with her morbid surroundings Ofelia let's her love for fantasy tales and active imagination take her on a journey. In the garden of the home, is a labyrinth which provides Ofelia with the basis for her magical world.Guillermo del Toro has created a fairytale that is more graphic and darker than normal, hence the R rating. It does show that you can tell a tale of fantasy that doesn't necessarily pertain to children, which is different from the norm being that the main character is an adolescent. The balance between the two worlds is perfectly achieved by del Toro. The special effects are excellent and so is the beautiful cinematography. Ivana Baquero who plays little Ofelia is also a joy.This film is a delight for those who have maybe lost faith in the magic of movies.",10,2,5,12 February 2007
Taxi Driver," So that's what a cab driver is thinking about...
","After watching Scorsese win his first Oscar last month, it dawned on me I had yet to see any of his early films. Taxi Driver was on the top of the list. A cult classic among De Niro and Scorsese fans, this dark noir tells of Travis Bickel (De Niro), a pent-up ex-Marine who takes the late shift driving a New York City taxi. Travis' long nights working in the seedy underbelly of the city begin to take their toll on him. Travis goes from a somewhat shy person, who asks out a young campaign worker (Shepherd) with the best of intentions, to a gun-toting madman. In the midst of his transformation, he befriends a young prostitute (Foster), who he feels somewhat compelled to try and save before the dark underbelly of the city swallows her up. All of this comes to a head in a fantastically crafted scene as Travis shoots his way past the young girl's pimp (Keitel) , the brothel's manager, and a client, all on his way to her room. As Travis sits there covered in blood, the camera starts to fade away from the room and the apartment building, police moving in. And of course a much talked about ending, which can be interpreted in many ways.Taxi Driver is certainly Scorsese's darkest film in terms of subject matter. It's a morbid look inside the mind of a man that is fed up with the failures of his society. However, a young De Niro is absolutely captivating as the deranged cab driver. It's fascinating to watch his mental transformation over the course of two hours of running time. Finding out that De Niro's 'You talking' to me' scene in front of the mirror was in fact not in the original script, speak to the excellence of both De Niro and Scorsese.",9,0,1,13 March 2007
Lost in Translation," A wonderful feel-good movie
","I had wanted to see this film after all it's Oscar-buzz a couple of years ago. I finally had the chance to watch it on cable last night. I fell in love with it. It's not conventional by any stretch of Hollywood standards, but what it does show is that having great actors is important when the script itself doesn't have a whole lot of dialogue.Bill Murray is an actor coming to Tokoyo to make Scotch commercials, after once being a successful actor. Scarlett Johanssen is the wife of a photographer, deciding to come on the trip to Japan with her new husband. One is a middle-aged man with previous success and the other is a early 20s college grad. However both are stuck as to what direction to take next in their lives. They both find each other and explore an exciting country they know nothing about and discuss their lives.The acting is great between Murray and Johanssen because it's the words they say in their facial expressions. Sophia Coppolla often uses long unbroken takes between the two having a conversation. Murray has mastered the speaking without words aspect of acting. Johanssen shows what sets her apart from the new actresses in Hollywood, I give her a pass on The Black Dahlia. She's great at expressing feelings with her eyes. Of course there is the creeping thought in the back of your mind that it's a love story and they will both have an affair. Well this is where Coppola goes against convention. A trap that could easily be fallen into in Hollywood is avoided. Each provides honesty and friendship for the other. They cling to each other because they are alone in a strange land they know very little about.Sofia Coppola shows she has inherited great qualities from her dad in her directorial debut. As mentioned the long takes in the dialogue and great scenery shots of Tokoyo. Also like her father, she isn't afraid to have silence in scenes. A good chunk of the film takes place in the hotel in which the two are staying, including a bar/lounge. From inside the hotel the outside beauty of the city is shown through these great big windows.I loved this film, I'm just sorry I missed it during its run years ago.",10,2,4,8 November 2006
The Devil Wears Prada," Better than I expected, which wasn't much.
","I finally got around to seeing this after all the talk about Meryl Streep's performance. While she was good, I found Anne Hathaway and Stanley Tucci to be on her level.When a young and somewhat naive woman, Andy (Hathaway), goes on a job interview for an assistant position, she gets more than she bargains for when it turns out she is working for an icy editor of a prestigious fashion magazine, Miranda (Streep). Her focus remains with being a journalist, but to get a crack at that job she must get through the tedious task at working for Miranda. To put herself in the good graces of her demanding boss, Andy ends up distancing herself from her boyfriend and friends. Soon she begins to question whether she is actually growing further and further away from her career aspirations.While the critical acclaim has gone to Streep, I really enjoyed Hathaway. It's rather refreshing to see a young actress who isn't blonde and rail-thin. While Hathaway is known for her Princess Diaries fame, she might just be on her way to higher profile films. Staring opposite Streep might be a good start. Hathaway reminds me of a younger Julia Roberts. Stanley Tucci also stands out as the magazine's art director, who turns out to be Andy's confidant, helping her stay on her feet and handling Miranda's ruthless demeanor. A secondary character in itself is New York City, which is beautifully captured by cinematographer Florian Ballhaus.In closing, the story is somewhat syrupy with its conclusion, but its actors make the film enjoyable.",7,2,6,30 January 2007
Little Miss Sunshine," Great blend of comedy and life lessons
","It's very hard to try and make a comedy that also has some morals to it without it being to cornball. Little Miss Sunshine proves that it can be done.An excellent ensemble cast of Toni Collette, Steve Carell, Greg Kinnear, Alan Arkin, and Little Miss Abigail Breslin. A colorful cast of characters makes up a family that decides to travel cross-country in a crappy VW bus to enter little Olive(Breslin) into a beauty pageant. Every character has their own demons. The Uncle (Carell) is just out of hospital after attempting suicide. The father (Kinnear) is a motivational speaker who is obsessed with 'winning' at life. The mother (Collette) is caught in the middle, trying to keep everything together. The grandfather (Arkin) is a druggie, foul-mouthed talent coach for Olive. There's also the speechless son (Paul Dano) who has decided not to speak at all until he gets into the air force. Then there's little Olive, determined to get to her beauty pageant but caught in the middle of deciding whether she wants to be a model and follow her father's obsessive winning attitude or just be a normal kid. What Little Miss Sunshine does so well is that it is able to give us humor in the predicament all these characters are in, because of the extreme opposites some of them are but yet its able to spread a positive message on the importance of family and being a good person. Sometimes its good to take a step back and not take ourselves so seriously. And yet, the film doesn't go out of its way to give you a good morale at the expense of taking away from the hilarious story line. Definitely one of the most enjoyable films I have seen this past movie year.",9,2,4,23 January 2007
The Illusionist," Count on Norton
","I have to give the guy credit, besides maybe The Italian job, which was because of contractual obligations, he always picks the right movies to be a part of.I must admit I probably would have skipped this one if Norton wasn't in it. He's one of those actors for me that I will see a movie he is in, no matter what the genre or story. I was pleased with this movie.Paul Giamatti probably took the rug out from under Norton in this one however. He is just fabulous as the police detective assigned to keep tabs on Norton's magician character. Giamatti's quirkiness and facial expressions make him a joy to watch. Jessica Biel didn't do anything to detract from the film, which is good i guess, in fact she is not bad in it. Norton, Giamatti, and Biel I must say all hold those Austrian accents very well.The story is somewhat predictable and losses steam in certain parts. The ending you can sort of see coming but the film as a whole is an enjoyable mysterious romance.Great sets and costumes. The visual effects are also well done, very subtle, which for this film is a necessity.",8,2,4,15 September 2006
The Departed," Scorsese gets back on track
","As good as I expected. I think its Scorsese's best since Goodfellas. Scorsese returns to his unfiltered best to make this entertaining crime film.The film revolves around an undercover cop, played by DiCaprio, who is sent to infiltrate Nicholson's mob organization. On the flip side Nicholson sends his 'son', played by Damon, into the police force as his spy. The tension grows as both men reveal the inner workings on the organizations they have infiltrated. The plot reveals plenty of twists and turns.Scorsese always seems to bring together a talented cast and he does it again here. I always find DiCaprio to be very 'hit or miss' in his roles. He does well here, very well in fact. He's never overmatched in the scenes with Nicholson and it proves to be what makes him very effective in this role. While Nicholson gets to show his creepy nefarious side, he tends to go a little overboard with the character. Damon has gotten to a point where he can take any role and play it well. He's great at playing the two-faced cop here. One thing that is very apparent is that he gets to bring on his native Boston accent ala Good Will Hunting. Nice supporting roles from Alec Baldwin and Martin Sheen as high-rankers in the department. However an actor that I cannot, as hard as I try, take seriously is Mark Wahlberg. He's so over the top in every role and he is here in my opinion.Scorsese's use of music weaving in and out of scenes at different volumes, something he did well in Goodfellas, comes back in this film. What shines through though is his knack for shooting chaos or violence. All of Scorsese's trademark storytelling techniques come into this one with a vengeance and make very a smooth and entertaining film.",10,1,2,10 November 2006
Hancock," Great start...then forgettable real quick!
","Starts out with a great premise for a superhero story. A superhero who has damaged his credibility with the public and reluctantly tries to build up some star power by enlisting the help of a public relations manager. However half-way through a plot twist comes your way and if you are paying attention, you see it coming. Then before you know it the film ends rather abruptly. Will Smith is gold as usual. He doesn't play his charming all-American good guy. Think more about Dr. House than Superman.I wanted more from the film because I like the initial concept. I expected more from a script that was penned by former X-Files writer Vince Gilligan too!",6,0,2,16 February 2009
Casino Royale," A darker shade of Bond
","This was the first 007 film I have seen in the theater since Goldeneye, ironically enough also directed by Martin Campbell. I have since seen Tomorrow Never Dies and The World is Not Enough on DVD. It felt like the stories were getting a little bit goofy and pre-packaged. I did like Bronsnan's Bond and was a little bit skeptical about Daniel Craig as the new leading man. I was very mistaken.Daniel Craig gives Bond a very different and interesting personality. He's more of a hard-ass in truth. He's a little more angry and viscous in this latest installment. Something that gives the film a little spice. The trademark one-liners are still there and James is still the ladies-man but Casino Royale definitely has a darker feel.The story places Bond at the start of his MI6 career, newly promoted to his double-00 status. A dangerous path leads him to be involved in playing a high-stakes poker tournament against a man who is a banker to some of the world's most dangerous terrorists. Bond of course needs significant funds to play at this table and to make sure he doesn't blow it all Vesper Lynd, played by Eva Green, is there to oversee the operation.In the end Casino Royale is a refreshing spin on Bond. The film is dark and the violence is a bit more graphic that one is used to in a 007 film, particularly a brutal torture scene. Bond actually gets some cuts and blood on his face! I just hope the next installment gets the same treatment.",9,0,2,17 November 2006
The Pursuit of Happyness," Will Smith is worth the price of admission
","What this film lacks in real story depth, it makes up for in the emotional depth of Will Smith's tremendous performance. While I haven't seen Ali, in my opinion, this is Will Smith's best performance.The story is about a real-life man named Chris Gardner who hits rock bottom financially but tries to keep himself and his young son afloat by applying for a stock broker training program. Unfortunately the program comes without a pay-check and it forces Gardner to keep at his previous job of selling high-density bone scanners to clinics and hospitals. To further divulge any of the story will really defeat the purpose of seeing the film, in my opinion. However, I have known about Gardner's story for a couple of years already. You might have already seen a feature on him on NBC's Dateline or ABC's 20/20, I can't remember which. To know where Gardner eventually ends up, its a real inspiration to see the hard journey that it took to get him there.My only complaint about the film comes from the fact it doesn't offer much story depth. Whether some aspects were cut or not, I'll have to find out myself; Gardner has written a memoir with the same title. Where this film succeeds is with Smith. Will Smith has an uncanny ability to draw people into whatever role he is playing. He's funny and extremely genuine in this film and those two abilities are important in telling this story. I'm not sure anyone else could have played this role any better. Why it works is because you feel for the character and the struggles he goes through and his triumphs. What also must not go unnoticed is the chemistry between real-life father and son combo of Will and Jaden Smith. It certainly helps the film because the two ultimately depend on each other for support.Inspirational true stories such as this are sometimes over-dramatized by Hollywood, but not this one. It feels real and it doesn't go out of its way to take advantage of emotional moments.",8,0,0,27 January 2007
V for Vendetta," Brilliant Sci-Fi film that deals with relevant issue
","After what I considered to be disappointing Matrix sequels, the Wachowski brothers bring to life a graphic novel that hits closer to our current society than one would think.The story revolves around a masked man who begins to terrorize what has become a totalitarian government in a not too distant future in London, England. He tells of his plan to detonate a bomb that will destroy the British Parliament in a year's time. In the meanwhile he exposes the dark and secretive history of some of the government's highest ranking officials, which fuel his vengeance and also explain his past. The masked 'V' befriends a young broadcast worker (Portman), who he confides in to help him with his destructive plans. She struggles between living in the flawed world she knows and rebelling against it to make some semblance of change.First-time director James McTeige brings with him a wealth of knowledge on how to craft this sci-fi tale, having been an assistant director on the Matrix films. The visual stylization makes every frame feel like it is jumping right out of the comic book. Plus, beautiful special effects that are not overly-gratuitous. While you never see his face, Hugo Weaving's delightful voice shines through V's mask. I could not think of any other person I would have playing this part. Weaving gives the character such a human depth that you can almost see the expressionless mask he wears, show emotion. Natalie Portman, who plays V's confidant Evey, also gives a surprisingly deep performance and a flawless British accent to boot. Stephen Rea and John Hurt also round out an excellent cast.While the film's conclusion is somewhat rushed, Vendetta as a whole is a brilliant piece of science fiction, uniquely blending fantasy with today's reality.",9,2,5,14 February 2007
