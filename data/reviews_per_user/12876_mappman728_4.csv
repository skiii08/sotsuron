The Equalizer," Silent but deadly
","Some films are a triumph of style over content. This isn't exactly a triumph but Antoine Fuqua directs with a panache that the ludicrous plot and risible dialogue don't merit. There's a highly enjoyable showdown in the US equivalent of Homebase, with nail guns, electric drills, strimmers and a variety of power tools being used to murderous effect. The heavies are a mix of corrupt Boston cops and assorted Russian mafia, the latter sporting villainous facial hair and scary tattoos. They're no match for Denzel Washington, however, even though he's looking a little on the paunchy side. In a finale that manages to be more unlikely than what's gone before, he takes a short trip to Moscow to finish off the main heavy, one Vladimir Pushkin, no less. Daft but highly watchable.",6,3,5,23 October 2014
Fury," Another fine mess
","A frustrating film. Much of it is one of the most realistic depictions of war I've seen - up there with 'Cross of iron' and 'Come and see'. Heads and limbs are blown off, rotting corpses are flattened in mud, and the chaos and brutality of the last days of Nazi Germany are also unflinchingly portrayed. Civilians hanging from trees and lampposts; snipers revealed as terrified schoolchildren in uniform; a grizzly tableau of bodies slumped round a table - Nazis unable to face defeat. There's also a graphic display of tank/infantry tactics which leaves nothing to the imagination. The last third of the film sadly descends into clich√© as the tank platoon makes a suicidal last stand against a 300 strong SS regiment. An odd decision by Brad Pitt as he's spent most of the film vowing to keep his platoon alive now that the war is almost over. Even odder is the platoon's decision to stay with him. A more appropriate response would be something along the lines of 'This is a fine mess you've gotten me into....' As you'd expect almost everyone perishes in a blaze of pyrotechnics, expertly staged but in terms of raw realism a damp squib compared with what's gone before.",7,0,3,17 November 2014
Gone Girl," Amazing Amy
","A film of two halves. The first half is a quite gripping police procedural narrative with frequent flashbacks, all of which turn out to be untrue . (Shades of Hitchcock's 'Stage Fright', although that only had a single lying flashback. ) The second half - still highly watchable - is not as convincing, with a succession of unlikely events, characters and coincidences. The film becomes less and less plausible and by the time it finishes, belief is completely suspended. It's well acted by all concerned, although the two leads are hampered by minimal characterisation. Ben Affleck is handsome but naive and fairly dumb. Rosamund Pike is attractive but homicidally devious - a near relative of the Sharon Stone character in 'Fatal Attraction', perhaps, though she favours a boxcutter over an ice pick... The film's publicity has made much play of the source novel's great length, pointing out that some 300 pages had to be cut. The missing pages presumably would resolve some of the implausibilities - Amy's ability to gain access to both her husband's office and her sister-in- law's woodshed in order to plant incriminating clues without either of them noticing, for example. A mini TV series might have been more satisfactory for the audience and done the book more justice.",7,1,10,23 October 2014
Lucy," Lucid Lucy
","Highly watchable sci-fi/crime film with pretensions, which would make an intriguing double bill with 'Under the skin'. (Scarlet Johannseen uses her unearthly powers in a fairly negative way in 'Under the skin but puts them to more socially acceptable use - ie killing a lot of bad guys - in 'Lucy'.) The sci-fi elements are more interesting than the crime elements, the latter consisting of Korean(?) drug pushers using naive foreign tourists as mules. As is the nature of these gangs, they have an inexhaustible supply of men, guns and bullets, coupled with an ability to storm public buildings, gunning down everyone in sight at the drop of a hat. No match for Lucy's mind-bending skills, however... The film goes a little transcendental towards the end, but its journey into oblivion includes a sequence in which the heroine experiences Times Square going back into time, ultimately revealing its earlier life as a primeval swamp. Fascinating stuff.",7,3,9,26 August 2014
