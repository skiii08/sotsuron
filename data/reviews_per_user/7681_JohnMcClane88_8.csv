Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Needed better Characters and less effects!!
","Episode 1 was missing something Empire Strikes Back had...A Great Story. I hope before Lucas writes the next episode he takes another look at Empire Strikes Back and remembers its really all about the characters and not the special effects. As much time and effort they spent on the special effects on this movie The Matrix seemed to pass them up. The Matrix was new and fresh and I might add took all the Oscars this yr, 4 in all and Episode 1 went home empty handed.(also I would like to add I hated the Jar Jar character)
True, Episode 1 made over $400m but 20yrs from now I think it will be remembered as the least favorite, Episode 1 was proof that if you don't have special characters no on will care about the special effects.

The Passion of Joan of Arc," Incredible!! You MUST See this Film!!!!!!
","I just seen this film last night for the first time on TCM and it was Amazing!Anyone who sees this film and does not like it is beyond me! What really made this film so incredible for was the time is was made.1928!The acting, directing, editing and camera shots are WAY ahead of its time!These are movie making methods American audiences would not see in American movies until the late 1960's and early 1970's and that are missing in most of Hollywood movies today!It blows my mind how a masterpiece 50 years ahead of its time such as 'The Passion of Joan of Arc' was made in 1928 and 77 years later Hollywood still makes crap like 'White Chicks' and 'From Justin to Kelly'The performance by Maria Falconetti is so stunning that the Academy should just give her an Oscar regardless of the fact her performance was 77 years ago!It was an Honor to have seen this film!",10,3,7,4 July 2005
American Beauty," Outstanding Movie!!!
","Once again a movie proves that its all in the writing, you get a great story, some fine actors and you end up with one helluva movie. I seen this movie last night along with 'The Six Sense' and I cant stop thinking about both movies, I believe I was lucky enough to see the two best movies of the year in one night. Kevin Spacey is guaranteed a best actor nomination and unless I see someone better before the end of the year I think he will win. It is truly a dark comedy/drama but you will laugh you butt off at a few great scenes. It is the type of movie you will think about days after you see it, and thats what a great movie is all about.",10,0,0,1 October 1999
No Country for Old Men," I Gave this Movie 1 Star!!....Worst Best Picture of ALL TIME!!
","I have never been more disappointed in a major movie in my entire life! I just watched this for the first time last night and I knew going into it that there was a lot of talk about the ending of this movie and how many didn't like it, And now I know why.*Spoilers...Like I care! The fact that the Josh Brolin character was killed or that his wife was killed or even that the Javier Bardem character got away is not the point, all that if written well is fine.The Problem is, and its a big one! Is that they WAY they did it! After investing, what 90 minutes? (or however amount of time it was, 3/4 of the movie) into the Josh Brolin character and a great cat and mouse game with him and the Javier Bardem character the unthinkable happens! All of the SUDDEN the Josh Brolin character is Dead!!! And how does he die? Not by Javier Bardem character! But by a bunch of mexicans that we NEVER see! We or the Tommy Lee Jones character just HAPPENS to come across Josh Brolin laying dead! WHAT????????????????????????? I invest all this time into these two guys and what do I get for my time? NOTHING!!!! What a FREAKEN Waste of my time!! After that happened I turned to my wife and said, 'Do you think Josh Brolin upset the Coen brothers that day and they just wrote him out of the movie?' LOL What a Joke! That was the most cheated I ever felt about a movie.Not too mention that whole scene with Tommy Lee Jones and Barry Corbin, after just being cheated that scene was like nails on a chalkboard! I give the first 3/4 of the movie up until Josh Brolin dies a solid 8! The rest of the movie after he dies, I give it a MINUS, yes MINUS -7!!! For a grand total of a stinken 1!!! GIVE ME BACK MY 122 MINUTES!!",1,4,8,13 August 2008
The Sixth Sense," One heck of a Great movie!
","Once again a movie proves that its all in the writing, you get a great story, some fine actors and you end up with one helluva movie. I seen this movie along with 'American Beauty' and I cant stop thinking about both movies, I believe I was lucky enough to see the two best movies of 1999 in one night. Bruce Willis was robed of a best actor nomination. It is truly a great movie. It is the type of movie you will think about weeks after you see it, and thats what a great movie is all about.",10,0,0,23 May 2000
The Matrix," Outstanding!
",I am not a big Sci-fi fan but I was blown away when I seen this film. I just hope when they make parts 2 and 3 they can make it just as great! Keanu Reeves doesn't make a lot of movies (Smart move on turning down Speed 2) but when he does they are really good! The one thing I couldn't stop thinking of was how much more I liked the special effects in The Matrix then Star Wars episode 1.,10,0,0,20 May 2000
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Clearly the best of all 4!
","This one is the best of all 4 movies and probably all 6 when the rest are released, but yet it made the least amount of money at the box office. Go figure! Episode 1 was missing something Empire had...A Great Story. I hope before Lucas writes the next episode he takes another look at Empire and remembers its really all about the characters and not the special effects.
True, Episode 1 made over $400m but 20yrs from now I think it will be remembered as the least favorite, Episode 1 was proof that if you don't have special characters no on will care about the special effects.The Empire Strikes Back had both!",10,0,1,22 May 2000
Braveheart," Greatest Love Story Ever!!
","You may not think so at first but once you see Braveheart you will agree that it is the Greatest Love story ever told. True it is an extremely violent movie with wall to wall action but its all based on William Wallace's love for his wife and it is what drives him and gives him his strength until the end. It is a great date movie, it has it all action, violence, love, and an emotional ending. If you rent it or buy it make sure you get the Widescreen version!!",10,3,6,16 May 2000
