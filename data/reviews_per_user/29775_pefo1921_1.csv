The Blair Witch Project," Scary, and not pleasant
","Scary movie, that leaves you with a feeling of dread. Didn't like the way handheld cameras 'swoosh' thru the air; It made me feel a little dizzy. Best part of movie is the last 10 minutes. In fact, the last 10 make the whole movie! 7 out of 10.",7,1,2,18 July 1999
