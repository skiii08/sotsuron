Casablanca," Greatest war propaganda movie ever made
","Every thing positive everyone has ever said about this movie is true.  Still compelling after all these years, one of my top ten movies, I can go back and watch every few years.This movie works on every level, drama, love story, suspense, but most of all it is a war propaganda movie.  Pro war, pro allies, anti Nazi, even a little anti French, this movie was made smack in the middle of WWII when the outcome was still in doubt and designed get the public behind the war effort.  It sure was more fun then those 'Victory gardens, paper drives and gas rationing' and other techniques to get public support.  It is impossible for a film made for this purpose to stand the test of time, but Casablanca has, and that's why it is such an incredible film.",10,8,11,22 March 2000
