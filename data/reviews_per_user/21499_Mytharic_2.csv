The New World," Worthwhile, Quiet Beauty of a Film
","This film has a quiet joy to it which I don't think I've seen anywhere else in my experience thus-far with film. The characters are all intensely, unconventionally, introverted, and the actors resist any temptation to exaggerate what is a sad but unsentimental story. And, while it's been said countless times, the landscapes of Virginia which are captured in this film are absolutely gorgeous. While I sometimes wished that the cinematographer had dispensed with the slow motion and disorienting cuts and opted for a more of a documentary-style, they did add a dreamlike quality to the film which seemed to parallel Pocahontas's and John Smith's mindsets.The film's greatness weakness, ultimately, is it's running time. The first 75 minutes focuses on John Smith and Pocahontas's romance, only introducing John Rolfe in the last hour. Rolfe simply isn't given enough time to develop as a character, and the audience isn't given enough time to understand the life Pocahontas has with him. If a good fifteen or twenty minutes had been added to that part of the story, her final decision to stay with Rolfe and her son would have had a greater emotional impact. Nevertheless, the ending was effective in cementing Pocahontas's change from a young lovestruck girl to a mature wife and mother, and was therefore a fulfilling conclusion to the film.",8,3,5,5 May 2009
Pulp Fiction," Near-Profound Insanity
",":SPOILERS: I don't think there's much I can say about this film that hasn't already been said. I guiltily enjoyed the dark humor and disturbing hilarity, which was executed perfectly by Jackson, Willis, and Thuman. I found Travolta's character a little too slick and confident to be believed; his attitude reminded me of similar characters Travolta has played in the past, making it more difficult for me to separate the actor from the character.The script, as I expected given that it was written by Quentin Tarantino, was full of gory violence and random tangents, the latter of which were both educational and entertaining. The non-linear narration was fun, though it didn't seem to serve much of a purpose other than to give greater weight to Vincent's decision to continue working for Marcellus and Jules' decision to turn away. Jules' decision, and his final monologue, elevates the film, for me, above a crazy thrill-ride. Before the final scene, the film presents characters who are funny, but nevertheless repugnant in their self-centerdness. Jules' ability to step outside himself and see his own hypocrisy and selfishness allows him to place the exaggerated travails of the film in within a moral context -- a moral context which does not diminish the hilarious insanity of the film, but reminds the viewer that a more fulfilling life does exist beyond that insanity",9,1,2,9 May 2009
