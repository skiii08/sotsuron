It," A collection of Unconnected scenes, a really bad script and a great cast.
","Well, ¿how can i start to describe the hideous experience i(and my 2 cousins who share the same opinion)had las Saturday? I'll say some good things about it: The cast is great. The group of kids is perfectly selected, with good acting and parts through out the movie. Some really hilarious lines made Finn Wolfhard stand out as the best in the movie. The clown created by Bill Skarsgård is delightfully scary, at least in the scenes where CGI is left out (And they are not a lot). Direction is good too. Now, bad things: all the rest. all of the teenagers 'visions' are a great mix up of horror films clichés. where CGI usually takes a leading role. Basement doors and sounds, abandoned houses, Zombies (leper, i know but let's be honest), blood bath (that hair and blood scene followed by the clean up WTF), and many more. When everybody knows what they have to do to finish IT, movie goes on for another 50 minutes with many scenes that could've been left out. The ending is far from scary, but a mix up of CGI'S, randomness and humor. I only stayed until the end because i have never left a movie before it, but believe me, i felt like it Many times.",6,2,5,25 September 2017
