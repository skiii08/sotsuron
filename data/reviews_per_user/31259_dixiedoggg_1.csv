First Man," Like watching paint dry...
","Don't get me wrong, I think Neal Armstrong is one of America's greatest heroes. But this film is so boring and slow that you spend most of the film saying 'get on with it'. The best part of the film is the scenes of the spaceflights, very well done, but the rest is just a mishmash of what I like to call 'uninteresting fluff'. I'm sorry the Armstrong family lost a daughter, but to come back to the little girl over and over is kinda annoying really. And the tensions among Neil and his wife were overblown and again, annoying.I think that another filmmaker could have done a better job. To reduce civilization's greatest achievement to this level of depression and mediocracy is really, really, sad.",2,10,16,4 February 2019
