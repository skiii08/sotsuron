Walk the Line," Combines great music with a really good love story
","Until I saw this movie Johnny Cash never really impressed me much as a person. I liked his music enough not to turn it off when it came on the radio. Now I am forever a fan of the man. Walk the Line is a beautiful story of a love that has no limits, no end.I have a new respect and a thirst to know more, for the man in black and his lady love, June. Reese and Joaquin made me fall in love not only with them, but also their characters.This movie belongs at the top of the ' great love story' list. I can't wait to own the movie and sound track. I want to see this movie again!!!!!This is a movie that combines great music and a really good storyline.Don't miss it.",10,1,3,21 November 2005
