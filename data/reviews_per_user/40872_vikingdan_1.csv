United 93," What was up with the European guy?
","Does anyone have a comment about the obviously European guy that was the only one strenuously raising doubts about the whole cabin-storming strategy? Unless there's evidence that there was a European on-board actively doing so, it appeared to me to be the only sloppy part of the movie.It came off as being uncharacteristically crude for a thoughtfully cast movie with such realistic dialog. I suspect it was the writer and director's attempts to symbolize Europe's perceived impotence in the face of terrorism. or perhaps it was an attempt to pander to the American audience (he was a Brit)? I loved the scenes with the 'road warriors' in first class who are stressed out and oblivious to the extra service they receive from the flight crew when those in economy seem to really appreciate it. They're more concerned that the graphics on some powerpoint may be too complex.I also though it interesting that it was the corporate guy from first class that was the leader of the revolt. So much for the working class hero!? Also refreshing to see a red-head portrayed in a heroic role ;-) Loved the behind scenes re-enactment of the FAA flight control centers and military command centers. the military lingo was perfect, 'turn and burn', 'scramble Otis' and 'weapons!'.Great movie if you can sit through the anguish of that horrible day again. Also made me miss those pre-9/11 days when planes were less than half full...",8,0,1,17 December 2006
