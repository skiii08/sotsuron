Kill Bill: Vol. 2," What a disappointment!
","What a disappointment for a long time Tarantino fan notwithstanding a very good cast.  Found Part 1 mildly entertaining and expected Part 2 to enhance overall experience.  No such luck.  Part 1 was way over the top (a times to the point of ridiculousness) and Part 2 was excruciatingly dull with too much boring dialogue. Continuity suffered through the over use of flashbacks, animation and black and white. The 2 parts could easily have been released as a single, shortened and much better edited film and accordingly felt ripped off.  Compared to Pulp fiction (a 9 rating) would give it a only a 3.",4,4,8,19 April 2004
Ocean's Eleven," good cast wasted in incredibly implausible plot.
",What a disappointment.  Good cast and good acting (especially Carl Riener who is outstanding) sunk by a plot that stretches credibility to an intolerable limit.  If you want to see a good caper movie try The Score or Sexy Beast instead.,4,0,1,17 December 2001
8 Mile," A fine movie ruined by the rapping!
","Good acting and fine filming probably accurately describing life in ghetto Detroit (akin to We were warriors), lost on me because not into rap culture (it seems ridiculous).  Even then had trouble understanding a lot of the dialogue and most of the rap.",6,0,1,23 November 2002
Mystic River," Surefire oscars for Sean Penn and Clint Eastwood.
","I do not normally like Sean Penn but his performance is masterfull in this faithful rendering (greatly enhanced by Eastwood's direction) of Dennis Lehaines darkly haunting novel.  Kevin Bacon and Laurence Fishburn too are outstanding. Close to perfect, I give it 9.5 of 10.",10,1,3,1 November 2003
