The Expendables 2," Over done
","I absolutely love Sly Stallone and the cast is great too, when the Expendables came out it was one of the few movies I had ever watched back to back. With much regret I must confess I do not feel the same way about this new installment. I will be the first to admit, there are some pretty great scenes throughout the movie, some great one liners and cool fights, but the main problem I had with this movie was that it did not take itself seriously like the first one. I get that most people feel this breed of movie is cheesy, which is fine, but the movie itself can't admit it or you get a piece of crap movie like Shoot'Em Up. E2 was over the top from the get go, with every actual cool scene over washed with 'try hard' one liners. That being said I could definitely find the good amongst all the bad and just pray the third one does not go in the same direction. I say this with love in my heart for the actors involved and the potential of the series.",6,3,9,20 August 2012
