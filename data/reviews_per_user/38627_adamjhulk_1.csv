Hereditary," Perfect
",One of the best horror movies I've ever seen . It's not your typical dumbed down Hollywood movie with typical and predictable jump scares with loud noises that do most of the work. It's definitely a slow burning psychological nightmare. I was honestly kind of disturbed by this movie and couldn't stop thinking about it for weeks! Most of the people I know who didn't like this movie are the same kind who thought the insidious movies were scary. If you're one of those than this may not be for you . I truly think this movie is a masterpiece and wish more movies like this would come out!,10,2,4,29 May 2019
