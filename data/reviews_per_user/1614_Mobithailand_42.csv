Angels & Demons," I gave up after about one hour. Not for me I'm afraid.
","Following a friend's recommendation, I started to watch 'Angels and Demons', directed by Ton Howard and starring Tom Hanks with really knowing what it was all about.As soon as the movie started, I realised I had made a mistake.I am not totally against 'action movies' or indeed any decent suspense or clever mystery yarn with 'baddies' and 'goodies', but it has to be really good – an Oscar winner, or close to.By way of example, a recent action movie that I thoroughly enjoyed was 'The Town': a bank heist, cops and robbers pic set in Boston and it was one of the best in that genre that I have ever seen. There was plenty of drama, action, suspense, and real people with real dramatic lives, to the extent that you actually believed in them and cared about what happened to them. But in the main, most of the formula-ridden junk that the film studios churn out these days leaves me absolutely cold.I read Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code, as it was a world-wide phenomenon, and I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. Well, it was a clever romp with some genuinely suspenseful and exciting story lines. I know I am being elitist, but I thought the quality of the writing was pretty ordinary, to say the least. However I was sufficiently interested to view the hyped up movie of the same name, but frankly, I couldn't even make it to the halfway stage. To me, it was totally boring garbage.And now, inadvertently, I was watching a Dan Brown 'sequel', complete with Tom Hanks performing a reprise role. I decided to give it a chance and watch it for a while, for something in the back of my mind reminded me that this movie was reckoned to be a much better film than the Da Vinci Code.It was a certainly a well-produced flick, and the 'no expense spared' production values oozed out of every inch of footage. The actors, including Hanks, were doing their best, but frankly it became very tedious. There was no chemistry between the two leading stars and there were lots of stereotypical, creepy Cardinals and other nasty Italian priests playing all the bit parts. The plot might have been fascinating in print, but to this reviewer, it was a piece of boring nonsense and the behaviour of the leading participants didn't contain one iota of credibility. The story involves a sinister, murdering group of scientists, whose ancestors went underground in the middle ages to protect them from persecution by the catholic church. Then these evil men, who kidnap and kill 4 cardinals and then blow up Vatican city with a piece of stolen anti-matter was, to say the least a bit far-fetched. But in this day and age, it was just another variation on a totally unoriginal theme. I am okay-ish with unbelievable plots – even way out science fiction plots - but the characters must always behave in a convincing and credible manner. In this movie, as in so many of a similar ilk, they simply don't. There was no way to relate to them as being believable, real people - they are just comic-book, cardboard cut-out dummies, with their strings being pulled by avaricious studio producers.I gave up after about one hour. Not for me I'm afraid.",3,0,1,3 May 2016
Captain Phillips," A masterful, towering movie of excitement, drama, suspense, shock and ultimately, intense emotion.
","I wasn't particularly looking forward to watching Captain Phillips as the subject matter didn't really appeal to me, but almost from the opening credits, I was completely hooked. It is a masterful, towering movie of excitement, drama, suspense, shock and ultimately intense emotion. In my humble opinion, it is far and away finest performance by Tom Hanks. Based on a true story, the film is about a gigantic, ocean-going container vessel being hijacked by a tiny band of desperate Somalis, and the immediate aftermath of this daring but utterly criminal act. We get to know the two main protagonists: Captain Phillips, (Tom Hanks), who is the strong, silent and incredibly brave master of the vessel, and the Somali hijack gang leader, Muse, (Barkhad Abdi).I cannot write much about the plot without spoiling the story for those of you who haven't yet seen it, but suffice to say that it romps along at quite a pace and things develop in dramatic and unexpected ways. I can guarantee that you will never become bored for one millisecond while watching this exciting and brilliantly acted movie. All the cast are totally believable in their roles, and there are no one- dimensional or 'plastic characters' – not even in the US Navy. The cinematography and direction (by Paul Greengrass) is so realistic that sometimes you think you are watching footage of the actual event.Even though we in the west deplore these hijackings and hostage taking, the film manages to perform an incredible task – it actually succeeds in evoking a measure of sympathy for the plight of the Somali perpetrators, and in particular, their leader, Muse. In the end, few watching can fail to be moved by the physical and emotional torment of Captain Phillips and if you leave the cinema dry-eyed and also without a feeling of being uplifted by the turnout of events, then you are not human.I note that the user reviews on IMDb are almost 100% unanimous in their high praise of this very worthwhile and 'must-see' piece of entertainment.",10,0,2,10 April 2016
Gravity," Strip away the 3D effects and what do you have left? Not very much I'm afraid
","When I was a kid growing up, I was a great lover of science fiction. I would devour stories by the likes of Arthur C Clarke, John Wyndham and H G Wells and as a kid, before I had any television in my home, I became entranced with radio Sci-Fi programmes, such as 'Journey into Space' and 'The Kraken Wakes'. In my teens I became a fan of early TV Sci-Fi, such as Dr Who, (of course), The Twilight Zone, and how can I ever forget Star Trek with the indomitable William Shatner.By today's standards, many of these programmes were pretty corny – particularly with regard to the special effects – but I loved them, and the stories just caught my imagination.For many years as a young, budding author, I dreamed that my first great novel would be in the science fiction genre.I suppose the last science fiction production to take me in, hook line and sinker, was the wonderful, '2001 – A space odyssey' which I went to see in London with a friend when I was about 23 years old.Sometime after that – I can't say exactly when or why – I fell out of love with science fiction. Every film or TV programme or book seemed to be yet another 'variation on a theme' and for some reason, I could no longer suspend credibility and become immersed in the fantasy.It was all too boring and frankly - corny; despite the millions spent on special effects and prosthetics that were supposed to transform humans into credible aliens.I will probably upset many of my readers by including such acclaimed masterpieces as 'Star Wars' in my boring, corny category. These wide screen extravaganzas that cost obscene amounts of money to make, and have attracted hundreds of millions of viewers throughout the world, leave me cold. I actually fell asleep through one of the Star War epics, when I was dragged to see it by my family. It was all too silly and superficial for me.So in a long, very roundabout way, this brings me to Gravity, which is hardly science fiction at all, as most of what takes place is almost within the bounds of present day feasibility.But it's as close to Sci-Fi as makes no difference, (IMDb classify it as Sci-Fi), so I confess that I was probably already predisposed to dislike it before I pressed the 'start' button.There is no question that the film relies heavily on its special effects to woo the audience; so if you, like me, watch it without the benefit of 3D, then I'm afraid you may be in for a tiresome 90 minutes.I am told that the 3D effects are incredible, and I don't doubt it, but strip them away and what do you have left? Not very much I'm afraid. I think I would rather watch a present day Doctor Who episode than this 'Gravity' tosh , and I haven't seen many of those in recent years as the 'bore factor' kicks in.The Gravity story is simple. Sandra Bullock and George Clooney are on a space-walk around the Hubble telescope, way out in space. The 'brilliant' Sandra is in the process of trying to fix a faulty part on Hubble when all hell breaks loose. They are showered in debris which was the result of some Russian missile doing something it wasn't supposed to do, and are they cast adrift and lose contact with mission control back on earth. Their own space ship is disabled and the remaining personnel are all killed. The remainder of story is about their attempts to get back to Earth by trying to propel themselves to alternative space crafts, (Russian and Chinese), that are floating around the firmament in various stages of disrepair. It is unclear what happened to the inhabitants of these craft.There is little or no character development and I was unimpressed with George Clooney's 'cardboard hero' persona and his distinctly unfunny, homespun dialogue. Bullock lurches from crisis to crisis, telling us along the way about her dead daughter, (which is supposed to make us feel even more sorry for her) and screaming and sighing at appropriate moments when it seems all is lost. To be honest, you don't particularly care whether either of them make it back or not and you certainly shed no tears. While many may enjoy this spectacle on the big screen in all its 3D glory, if it is stripped of that major selling point, the dialogue, acting, and even the music rarely rise above the mediocre.What astonishes me about this movie is that yet again, the professional critics are raving about it, and it picked up a whole gamut of BAFTA awards including best British film, best Director and best music, and an amazing 7 Oscars, including best director, best cinematography and best music. Call me a cynic, but is this the George Clooney/Sandra Bullock/ 'establishment' connection.?Just in case you think I am alone in thinking that Gravity is just a piece of mediocre dross, let's see what the good folks on IMDb have been saying:'Stop advertising this as a good movie! I just don't understand why this score and all the good reviews over the net are all about This movie has no story development, no character development and the script sucks'Gravity is Weightless. Did those who've written glowing reviews of Gravity see the same movie I did?Honestly, they go on and on.Just what is it with these professional film reviewers and us amateur dummies? Just who is it that knows a good movie when they see one?",3,1,3,14 April 2016
Argo," A good film - pity about the factual inaccuracies.
","This is the film about the rescue of 6 American diplomatic personnel out of revolutionary Iran in 1980. It is directed by and stars Ben Affleck.The movie has won almost every award going and Affleck picked up countless best director awards, and even though he was not nominated for a best Director Oscar, he did pick up the Oscar for best film. This type of movie has never particularly appealed to me, but I have been a huge fan of Affleck ever since his excellent film The Town in 2010, and given the universal acclamation, I decided to give it a go. I wasn't disappointed. It is a very good film. As I heard someone say the other day, it was so good that you got totally caught up in the drama and excitement of the rescue, even though you already knew the outcome. A good movie has the ability to do this, as is evident in such blockbusters as 'The Titanic', where everyone knew exactly what was going to happen.There is little I can find to say in criticism of this movie - but I will try... The cast provided a great ensemble performance, with no single actor being particularly outstanding, and the story romps along at a good pace to prevent our interest and excitement from flagging. All in all a highly enjoyable, and expertly made film, but whether it deserves the superlative accolades that have been showered upon it – I remain unconvinced. Personally, I think that 'The Town' is a much better movie. It's probably just me; I'm sorry but I just cannot find John Goodman believable in any role he has played since he was Roseanne Barr's husband in the long-running American sitcom. To my mind, he always has been and always will be that slob of a working-class father with dysfunctional kids and a nutcase for a wife. Everything else he has tried to do, in my opinion, simply doesn't come off. He certainly doesn't ruin Argo, and does his best to deliver as good a performance, but for me, he is always the slob from 'Roseanne'.There are also a number of totally unnecessary and silly factual inaccuracies. These deliberate errors glorify the America's involvement while disparaging or ignoring the contributions of other countries. This is quite sad, and it took a number of protests before Affleck conceded he had indeed misrepresented the truth. It leaves a bad taste in the mouth - a pity, because in all other respects, Argo is a pretty good film.",7,0,1,18 April 2016
The Danish Girl," A well made movie - but not for everyone.
","If this film had not been amongst the Oscar nominees, I would not have bothered to watch it.I have absolutely nothing against transgender people – indeed, some of my good friends in Thailand have been Thai lady-boys. but I wasn't sure that I really wanted to watch a film about transgender surgery. I also wasn't sure that I wanted to see Eddie Redmayne in drag.Again, I have nothing against men in drag, but it just isn't my thing.As with Brooklyn, the film is beautifully made and I had already fallen in love with the brilliant and beautiful Alicia Vikander following her roles in Testament of Youth (a great film!) and Ex-Machina, (also pretty good).It is Copenhagen in 1926, and Vikander plays Gerda an artist, the wife of Redmayne, who plays Einer, also an artist.Einer believes he is a woman in a man's body and decides to change his appearance into a female and his name from Einar to Lili. Gerda continues to love and support Lili in his/her quest to become a female. Lili becomes the first person to ever undertake transgender surgery.Redmayne was nominated for best actor for this role. Quite frankly, I couldn't see it. I couldn't totally see it last year when he won the Oscar for playing Stephen Hawking; but this time around, it seems that the luvvies of Hollywood have nominated him for the nature of the role, rather than the way he actually played it.He was okay-ish but nothing special. I am sure that there are hundreds of actors out there who could have made a better fist of it – What's wrong with using one of those brilliant Scandinavian actors who all speak excellent English? They act their socks off in their 'Scandi noir' dramas. But Redmayne is the man of the moment and no doubt a draw for audiences.The film is beautifully shot and sensitively directed, and for what it's worth, it does hold your attention, especially when Vikander is on the screen. It's an interesting story, and the setting of Copenhagen in the 1920's makes for some fascinating sets and cinematography.It goes without saying that Swedish Alicia won the Oscar for supporting actress – the first of many I suspect.The Danish Girl isn't for everyone; but if this is the kind of subject matter that appeals to you, you could do worse than give this well- made film the once over.",7,0,1,27 March 2016
Spotlight," I cheered out loud when it won the Best Picture Oscar
","I saw this movie before the Oscar winners were announced. I wasn't particularly attracted to it, as although the subject matter sounded interesting, I was fearful that it might be a rather plodding film – about journalists slowly uncovering a scandal that is no longer as shocking as it was back in 2001.(Indeed, does anything shock us anymore?)As with Brooklyn, I couldn't have been more wrong.In many ways, this is an old-fashioned type of film and brings to mind similar films such as 'All The Presidents Men'. Spotlight, is a well-made, thoroughly professional film that was a joy to watch. It relates the true events of The Boston Globe's investigative reporting unit, who uncovered widespread abuse of children by catholic priests in the Boston diocese. Even more, it uncovered the indefensible and disgraceful cover-ups by senior clergy – in particular, the head of the archdiocese, Cardinal Bernard Law – in order to protect the perpetrators and the 'good name' of their church.Spotlight was the title of the Boston Globe's four-person unit that went into battle against the powerful catholic establishment.They came under enormous pressure from those on high to cease and desist.The film traces events back to the very start of the investigation when there weren't even enough facts to make a publishable story. Later, when it became clear that there was indeed a verifiable story which involved a single abusive priest; the editor refused to publish the story until they had uncovered the whole sorry mess. It was only after the Spotlight team succeeded in gaining access to hitherto court protected documents that they were able to blow the scandal wide open. As soon as their story was published, hundreds more victims of abuse came forward to give their own stories of abuse at the hands of Catholic priests in the Boston area.One priest alone was revealed to have raped or molested 130 children for decades while Cardinal Law moved him around to different churches rather than going to the authorities and having him charged. Cardinal Law also orchestrated secret settlements for claims of abuse made against at least seventy of his priests, in which families were paid to keep silent about the molestation and rape of their children. The cardinal resigned after the story became public, but two years later he was promoted to a prestigious position in the Vatican by Pope John Paul.Since the Spotlight's gritty exposition in 2002, the mass sexual abuse of children has been uncovered in the Catholic Church – not only throughout the United States but all over the world.The tight paced direction, the great music score, and the brilliant ensemble acting by Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, Liev Schreiber, John Slattery – and especially Mark Ruffalo – have all made this a film well worth watching. I promise you won't be disappointed.Along with most people, I was fully expecting The Revenant to get the nod for Best Picture, and I actually cheered out loud when they announced the most coveted Oscar of all went to Spotlight. It deserved it.",9,2,3,31 March 2016
Youth," A masterpiece of film-making which will entertain and uplift you in equal measure.
","Michael Caine is yet another one of a small select group of actors who always turns in a great performance and will make any movie he appears in feel a bit special. He is now in his 80's and some of my other favourites, such as Pacino and De Niro are not too far behind in the age ranks. I'm not too sure who is going to replace them in my affections when they finally call it a day - probably no one. The last Caine film I saw was the excellent Harry Browne, in which he plays an avenging, retired marine. The part suited him down to the ground. I am not convinced that Caine was perfectly cast in Youth, although the old trooper pulled out all the stops and delivered his usual blistering performance. Caine was, is, and always will be a cockney. He is pretty good at American accents and he had a wonderful upper-class British accent in the film that made him - Zulu. But in Youth, Caine plays the part of a world renowned, retired maestro - an orchestral conductor on a par with Barbirolli or von Karajan. I'm sorry, but dear old Michael, however hard he tries, doesn't quite pull off the right accent. He wasn't a Malcom Sergeant - not even a Colin Davis. He tries to speak in an educated middle-class accent, but to me, his cockney strains still came through.I doubt if the director, Paolo Sorrentino, who also wrote this fine movie, even realised the problem existed - after all, he's not English. I know Caine was supposed to be a bit of a rough diamond, but how rough a diamond can you be if you have lived and breathed the world of classical music for your entire life. I can't see anyone's cockney accent surviving that. But I guess it's only the English who will notice it.The film's screenplay was very original and the film was beautifully made. Together with Harvey Keitel, who plays an ageing film director, Caine is holidaying at an exclusive upmarket Swiss hotel in the Alps. The hotel caters for the rich and famous where healthy food and exercise is the order of the day. We have a female British pop star (Rita Ora), a very fat Maradonna look- alike, a real Miss Universe, a high-class escort, and many more diverse characters, most of them young and beautiful.Caine is visited by the Queen's equerry, who asks Caine to conduct some of his own compositions for Prince Philip's birthday. He declines - twice. Keitel is surrounded by a ragbag trio of young impecunious screenwriters who are helping him to complete his latest screenplay. The two octogenarians also have their respective son and daughter with them, who are married to each other; but the Keitel's son dumps Caine's daughter soon after the movie starts. So what are all these people really doing there and how do they interact with each other? Will Caine eventually change his mind and agree to conduct for the Queen? Will 'has-been' Keitel get his script finished and will he get the money to shoot it? Will the arrival of feisty Jane Fonda as Keitel's leading lady change anything? Then there is Caine's estranged wife - who is dying.The film quite clearly has Italian roots. There's some titillating nudity and a few doses of 'rumpy-pumpy' to spice things up a bit, along with a healthy dose of surrealism and a lot of laugh out loud, witty humour. It is about two successful men at the end of their lives, thinking back to the days of their youth. It is also about the youths themselves and the intense, fleeting relationships they have with each other. It is a masterpiece of film-making and it will leave you feeling entertained and uplifted. I can't explain why - it just does.My wife, who is Thai, couldn't make head or tail of what was going on, but that doesn't surprise me. She struggled mightily with the dialogue - which is at the heart of the film. In any case, there's no discernible plot in the traditional sense, it's far too Italian for that. As another IDMb reviewer has written, 'Either you love it or you get nothing from it.' I loved it and my wifewell...she...(guess)",9,1,3,28 April 2016
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Overall, it was an enjoyable ride.
","I am a life-long fan of John Le Carré. He is one of my favourite 20th Century authors – and he is still going strong in his 70's. 'Tinker Tailor Soldier, Spy' was a classic of the cold war spy genre and it wasn't long ago that I watched the BBC 1979 adaptation, which I enjoyed very much, although I found the background music somewhat grating. So it was with great anticipation that I sat down to watch the 2011 celluloid version of Le Carré's classic.On the whole I did enjoy it and I think I will probably watch it again as I feel it is that rare kind of film that requires more than one viewing to fully appreciate its 'finer points'. I have to say that if I hadn't read the novel and recently watched the BBC version, I doubt that I would have had much idea about what was going on. The film is a 'film noir' to outdo all 'film noirs' and I think you would have you be a bit of a clever-clogs to really follow all the nuances of the convoluted plot if you hadn't previously read the book or seen the BBC adaptation. But given that I had and I did, I managed to follow where the film was going – just about, as they did change some of the finer points of the story line. I also found some of the scenes quite brilliant in their ability to evoke to a bygone age and atmosphere.I am now devoted fan of Gary Oldman who gave a masterful portrayal of George Smiley, but I do feel that most of the other main characters were pretty one-dimensional. Not the actors' faults, as they were all top drawer, and did their best with the material at hand, but more a fault of the screenplay. The exception to this was Smiley's wife, of whom we only ever caught the briefest glimpses, yet in some indefinable way, we somehow knew all about her. It is a 'patchy' piece of work – brilliant in parts and sometimes baffling, but never, as some have asserted, boring. The plot moves along in brief 'snapshots' of dialogue and action and as a consequence, you have to be pretty quick-witted to fully appreciate what is actually happening. Overall, it was an enjoyable 'ride', and I particularly loved the scenes of the spooks' 70's 'office Christmas party', which were so evocative, grotesque and almost scary. I also loved the ending, but I won't spoil it for you. Oh the music is totally brilliant!",7,2,2,25 April 2016
The Hateful Eight," Most Tarantino Fans will probably like it.
","Although tipped as an early runner for a heap of Oscars, in the end, the only nominations it received were for best supporting Actress (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and for cinematography and music. About par for a Tarantino film. It won for music. (Ennio Morricone)I have always been a keen fan of Quentin Tarantino, who wrote and directed this epic western, but I don't think it is one of his best. Having said that, I am not a particular fan of the western genre, as in my younger days, it was done to death, both by Hollywood and by the television networks.But of course, a Tarantino western is no ordinary western. Darkly comic and violent as it is, in some ways, it is more like an Agatha Christie murder mystery – and is often just as silly and superficial. One man is poisoned, another is shot in the head, another has his head blown clean off and another is hanged, and so on. Almost to the end, we don't know who the baddies and goodies are – in true Christie fashion.The film is a massive 3 hours in duration. It is set just after the end of the civil war and nearly all the action takes place inside a single room of a stagecoach stop in the middle of the Wyoming prairie. Outside, a violent snowstorm prevents anyone from leaving. It could have very easily been a stage play and who knows? One day, it might be just that.The ensemble cast, including Samuel L Jackson and Kurt Russell, are outstanding, although I am not convinced that Jason Leigh should have been nominated for best supporting actress for playing the part of a deranged, violent criminal gang leader. But the superior acting by one and all and the regular insertion of grizzly violence keeps the simple plot moving along quite well.I suspect that Tarantino had planned to make a western masterpiece, but in my opinion, he didn't quite make it. The dialogue is good, without being outstanding. For me, the film was missing something that would take it right out of the ordinary. It didn't quite make the sum of its excellent parts.I can't fault the cinematography, the acting, the brilliant direction, and the great music score and for this reason, I rate this quite highly. The Hateful Eight is not for everyone, but most Tarantino fans will probably enjoy it, unless they are heavy smokers.",8,1,3,27 March 2016
Life of Pi," Funny, exciting, frightening and inspiring - all in equal measure.
","I heard about this novel by Yann Martel some years back when it won the Booker prize, but I confess that the subject matter did not inspire me to sit down and read it. However all the hoo-ha surrounding the release of this movie in 3D, which was directed by one of my 'must see' film directors, Ang Lee, encouraged me to go and see when it opened in 3D here in Pattaya.I loved this movie. It was a visual feast, it was funny, exciting, frightening and inspiring, all in equal measures. It is a magical adventure story about an Indian youth who finds himself adrift in the Pacific Ocean on a lifeboat with a zebra, a hyena, an orang-utan and a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker - all of them fighting for survival. One might imagine that boredom would soon set in such a film in such a setting, (as it did for me in Castaway), but not a bit of it. Indeed, Tom Hanks would probably have benefited from having a dangerous animal or two on his castaway island. The story races along, and there is never a dull moment as the young man struggles to survive and come to terms with the presence of a tiger sharing his space. It is riveting stuff.I have yet to be convinced by the use of 3D in movies and still believe that it will eventually turn out to be a passing fad. But in The Life of Pi, the use of 3D is absolutely stunning and is an incredible feast for the eyes. There is no question that when it is used in particular situations, as it was in this movie, it certainly does enhance the viewing pleasure.Suraj Sharma in the lead role as Pi is a treasure and is totally believable as a young, pubescent teenager coming to terms with his situation with humour, angst and not a small amount of courage and ingenuity. As the story drifts further and further from reality, there is an intriguing twist in the tale, which I will not recount and so spoil your viewing pleasure, but will simply say that for me it was the 'icing on the cake' of a highly entertaining and thought provoking film. Well done and thank you to Ang Lee and Yann Martel.",10,0,2,18 April 2016
American Sniper," Whatever your personal feelings about war may be, it is a film well worth seeing.
","This movie came in for an avalanche of adverse criticism from many who claimed the film is all lies, and is just a massive piece of Republican propaganda.When I read this, I wondered if I had seen the same movie.Clint Eastwood is a major Hollywood director of much distinction, as is Bradley Cooper a major box office star, and it seems very difficult to believe that the Republican Party (who 99% of Hollywood hate with a purple passion), would be able to exert any influence on how this movie was put together.The movie was a major hit all over the USA, and it broke box- office records for an Eastwood movie. The movie was made because Hollywood knew it would put bums on seats, not because the Republicans told them to make it.The fact remains that Chris Kyle is credited with being the most lethal sniper in US history, with 255 kills of which 160 have been officially confirmed.So where is the disgraceful distortion and fabrication?It seems that many in the anti-war brigade seem to think that any war films that are made about Iraq and Afghanistan should proclaim from the hilltops how wrong it all was. The 'anti-war brigade' complain bitterly when Kyle and his fellow marines call the enemy 'savages', and that the film doesn't try to show the enemy's' point of view.Why should it? It's a film about an American sniper – pure and simple. They call the enemy 'savages' because it is their job to kill them – or more accurately – kill or be kill. What would they have them say to the enemy? They are trained American killers, and they are doing what they've been ordered to do. If you want to see a film about the wrongs of war – don't go and see American Sniper. All armies have snipers – they always have had and always will have. It's a not particularly glamorous or even heroic part of warfare, and I didn't see anywhere in the film where Kyle tried to suggest that it was – in fact if anything, the contrary is true.His fellow SEALS said he was a hero – but not Kyle, he knew better. He was just doing his job. Even his own brother, who was also in the army, made some serious anti-war sentiments when Kyle met him at the airport Todd McCarthy of 'The Hollywood Reporter,' wrote: 'A taut, vivid and sad account of the brief life of the most accomplished marksman in American military annals.' Retired snipers have stated that the movie is very realistic in how a sniper is portrayed. It is a particularly unpleasant, un-heroic 'profession'; but hardly a piece of Republican propaganda.As with all movie bio-pics, it contains scenes that were based more on the creative minds of Hollywood writers than in fact – what's so new about that? Has there ever been a war film that is based 100% on fact? I doubt it.Now to the movie itself.I must say up front that I'm not a big fan of war movies. No matter how well made they are, I always become confused when I am watching war action sequences. I never know exactly what it is they are trying to do, which fighters are on which side, who is killed, who are the killers and even when the fighting comes to a 'ceasefire', I don't even know who has won, or who gained the advantage.To me most war scenes in movies are just explosions of violence where people from both sides are killed and wounded, but I rarely have any idea what is really going on. No doubt film directors would be horrified to read this as I'm sure they plan and create their war action sequences with meticulous care, but for me and many – it goes right over our collective heads. In this respect, 'Sniper was better than most – especially when Kyle working as a sniper, as we can see who he is aiming to take out, and whether he succeeds. But as soon as Kyle joins his squad on the ground then things become murkier, although I have to say, I did more or less follow most of the action.The film is a very interesting account of an American patriot who went back to Iraq time and time again, (four tours of duty), saw countless of his comrades killed or maimed. He eventually takes retirement for the sake of his wife and family; only to be killed back home by a mentally deranged veteran he was trying to help.He was clearly troubled by what he was doing; he knew he had to kill to protect his fellow fighters, but took little pleasure in it. When he went back to the USA at the end of a tour of duty, demons haunted him, and he had great difficulty adjusting back to civilian life. The film also does an excellent job in showing us the pain and distress of the families back home in America.Sure, the movie erroneously shows Kyle taking out an Iraqi sniper called Mustafa who was an Olympic level marksman operating in Fallujah. In his autobiography, Kyle himself stated that 'other US snipers killed him'. Does it really matter? He is indeed credited with killing an insurgent from a mile away.Eastwood is one of my favourite directors and he never makes a bad film. This is not his best, but all in all it is a pretty good effort and is worth seeing – even if you are an anti- war liberal.It depicts life as it happened, both in Iraq and back home, in interesting, entertaining and dramatic ways that held my attention throughout.Whatever your personal feelings about war, it is a film worth seeing.mobithailand.com",7,0,11,1 April 2016
American Hustle," The American Oscar-Hustle, the biggest hustle of all
","The American Oscar-Hustle, the biggest hustle of allI was looking forward to seeing American Hustle, as it had received very good reviews and was nominated for a number of prestigious awards, including many Oscars. It sounded like a star-studded caper that would provide an enjoyable 2 hours viewing. With stars like Christian Bale and Amy Adams, together with the pair that I loved in 'Silver Linings Playbook' – Jenifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper – and to top it all, being directed by 'The Silver Linings' Director of the moment, David. O Russell – how could it fail?Well, the answer to this question, according to box office receipts and a vast majority of professional critics is that it didn't fail – in fact you could call it an unqualified success. After all, most reviewers gave it at least a 4 out of five stars, using such gushing language as:'The bizarre and hilarious situation rattles along, never entirely diverted or derailed, with plenty of comic set pieces.'And'It's all rangy and loose, with scenes that look as if they could be re-cut and re-edited every which way. It could easily be two or three times as long, and there is enormous pleasure in Russell's sustained riffing.'And finallyAnd at the end, we feel dizzy and disorientated, like marks who don't know we've been had. It is pure style from David O Russell..It all left me wondering if I was watching the same movie. Maybe I was simply in a very bad mood, but whatever it was, I remained unamused, totally confused, but most of all, thoroughly bored. The characters did absolutely nothing for me and I completely lost interest in what they were trying to do – all that I did feel was a total lack of empathy for these silly con-people. I confess that I became so bored that not only did I find difficulty in following the gibberish plot lines, but in moments of sheer tedium, I actually fast forwarded through some of the over-long, verbose dialogue. I cannot recall another occasion when watching a movie when I have resorted to doing this. It was almost 'wall-to- wall' talk, talk and more talk, which I found to be neither fascinating, nor amusing. It was just a load of 'west-coast-speak' diatribe. I couldn't even begin to tell you what the plot was about as it is a while since I saw the movie and it was so forgettable, that nothing – not even the parts that I was able to follow – has stuck in my memory. If the movies should be judged by the sum of its parts, then by rights, American Hustle should be right up there, as there is much good acting, clever cinematography and stylish direction, but to what ends? Even if I am the only person who didn't get the jokes and was bored by the stupid capers and unlikely twists in the plot, did this film about a group of American con artists who lead glib, clever lives deserve to be crowned as the finest film made in the English language in 2013?I think not.Again, as with Birdman, the professional reviewers seem to be totally out of touch with the cinema going public. Sure, their rave reviews have meant that millions have flocked to see it, but what did they think of it? In many years of reading about movies on the Internet Movie Data Base, (IMDb), I have never seen such a litany of negative public reviews. Usually, the punters will rave about movies on IMDb, even when the critics have panned them, but this time it is the other way around. I am talking of review-headlines such as:-'Just not understanding the hype','Looks Like I'm the Only One Who Didn't Like It','Don't be 'Hustled' by the reviews'.'American Hustle' is okay and nothing more','Disappointed beyond belief!','No plot, no acting, no drama, no fun','Bells and Whistles but Nothing to Care About','Disappointing','Self-indulgent mediocrity','Do not get ensnared in the hype surrounding this hustle...'Believe it or not, these are the first 10 headlines that I copied – in order – from the IMDb 'user-review' section. Looks like it's not only me after allBut in spite of all this, as at 4th April 2014, it had grossed a whopping 150 million dollars in the USA alone, thanks, no doubt, to the rave reviews from the critics and the early garnering of 44 awards plus, of course, no less than 10 Oscar nominations.The Oscar-Hustle, the biggest hustle of allRead more about this reviewer at mobithailand.com",3,5,7,8 April 2016
"Good Morning, Vietnam"," It is funny, entertaining, sad and thought- provoking in equal measures.
","'Good Morning Vietnam', starring the late American comedian and movie mega-star, Robin Williams, is probably the most telling and memorable anti-war film made about the Vietnam war.I have mixed feelings about Williams as a comedian – I suppose I struggle a little with him in much the same way as Americans struggle with many British comics. He was undoubtedly a very gifted, genuinely funny man and when I succeeded in following his very fast repartee, I can laugh along with the best of them. But sometimes, his delivery is fast, and so 'American' that I just can't follow what he is saying, so most of his clever humour goes over my head. I do remember once watching him being interviewed on UK's Michael Parkinson chat show, some years ago and he was utterly hilarious and took the whole show over with his brilliant antics and 'one liners'. Maybe he slowed down his delivery a bit for us slow-witted Brits. He is also no slouch as a movie actor and has a string of successful hits to his name. I was never a great fan of Mrs. Doubtfire but I thought his performance in Dead Poets Society was truly inspirational.I like Williams a lot in Good Morning Vietnam and his wacky, spontaneous sense of humour was absolutely perfect for the role of the irreverent, entertaining DJ who was shipped over to Saigon to shake things up at the armed services radio station. The movie is based on the true experiences of a DJ who was sent there during the early days of the war, and he states that the story is about 40% accurate – but which 40%? Of course, we will never know. I still had problems with Williams' rapid-fire delivery and 'one-liners', when he was broadcasting 'on air' and sometimes I was lucky if I caught one joke in five of his deliveries. But that didn't matter, as he was in character and was playing the part of this crazy, funny DJ and I have no doubt that the GI's had no problems in understanding what he was saying.Interestingly, like The Deer Hunter, the entire Vietnam sequences (which are prevalent throughout the movie) were all shot in Thailand. I had not realized this until I read the closing credits, although I should have known something was amiss - the traffic was all driving on the left-hand side, whereas in Vietnam they drive on the right. The Deer Hunter did not really deal with the Vietnam war as such, but merely used the war as a background to show the effects the war had on a group of blue-collar workers from America's hinterland. 'Good Morning Vietnam' on the other hand, was clearly an anti-war, anti-military bullshit-bureaucracy, where tin-pot, ignorant, myopic officers abused the power they had over their fellow soldiers. We can make some allowances for a certain degree of dramatic licence in the interest of a good story. But even so, the background to the movie was totally believable and certainly provided an interesting insight into how seeds were being sown, which would eventually lead to America's greatest military disaster. When the Williams character arrived in Saigon in 1965, the conflict in Vietnam was regarded as a local little skirmish, but by the time he was thrown out of the country, it had already developed into a full-scale war, even though news of the daily bombings in Saigon by Viet Cong terrorists and the general war escalation was kept from the local radio airwaves.Ironically, along with many other milestones, the Vietnam War eventually became the first war where the world could watch the 'action' from the front lines as they ate their dinner at home every night. It was the first time that unimpeded access was granted to journalists and TV crews.'Good Morning Vietnam' is funny, entertaining, sad and thought- provoking in equal measures. Enough time has now passed for the viewer to resist the urge to become too judgmental about the 'villains' of the piece' – the US military; but nevertheless, it remains an interesting film which helps us to understand why America's 'Dunkirk' will probably remain part of their psyche for many years to come. If you haven't yet seen it, I recommend you give it a go.",9,1,1,4 May 2016
The Killing Fields," Go search it out and watch a piece of truly horrifying history within living memory.
","'The Killing Fields', is Roland Joffé's ground-breaking, British-made drama about the Kymer Rouge's brutal, 5-year regime in Cambodia. This Academy award-winning film, made in 1984, tells the true story of an American newspaper journalist, (Sydney Schanberg) and his Cambodian Assistant, (Pran) before, during and after the takeover by Pol Pot and his murderous Khmer Rouge regime.The film is beautifully directed, shot and acted and it accurately portrays a truly harrowing and heart-breaking period in Cambodia's recent history. The Killing Fields should be compulsory viewing for anyone who lives in this region, particularly in Thailand, Cambodia or Vietnam. This genocide only took place some 37 years ago, yet for most people under thirty, they have little or no knowledge of what took place, right on their doorstep. Here in Thailand, there seems to be universal ignorance of tragic events that happened so close to their common border. Estimates of the total number of deaths resulting from Khmer Rouge policies during the period they controlled the country (1975-1979), including from disease and starvation, range from 1.7 to 2.5 million out of a population of around 8 million, or give or take, 25% of the population. One American reviewer recently described this film as 'The Ultimate Ugly American Movie' and goes on to say: '.that amazing film about the human price of American involvement in Southeast Asia.' The film includes some 'telling references' about America's dubious role in the terrible events that overtook Cambodia, such as: 'After what the Khmer Rouge have been through, I don't think they'll be exactly affectionate toward Westerners.' (spoken by a US embassy official) and: 'Maybe we underestimated the anger that $7 billion in bombing would unleash.' (Sydney Schanberg.) During the U.S. war in Vietnam, Cambodia was embroiled in a bloody civil war between the communist Khmer Rouge, backed by China and North Vietnam, and Cambodian government forces backed by the U.S. From 1969-73, the U.S. military covertly carpet-bombed eastern Cambodia in an attempt to disrupt North Vietnamese operations and defend the government against the Khmer Rouge, causing the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Cambodian citizens. For a country which at the time had a population of about 6 million, the losses were enormously devastating. Amongst the Cambodian populace, resentment grew against the U.S. and what was perceived as the American 'puppet government' in Phnom Penh. The Khmer Rouge represented resistance to the U.S. and consequently, as bombs continued to fall, Cambodian citizens flocked to join them.Sydney Schanberg, who was a New York Times reporter and renowned for his experience in Cambodia at the time, said the Khmer Rouge ' would point at the bombs falling from B-52s as something they had to oppose if they were going to have freedom. And it became a recruiting tool until they grew to a fierce, indefatigable guerrilla army.' Eventually, the Khmer Rouge were able to overwhelm the government forces and establish control over Cambodia, leading to Pol Pot's 'agrarian revolution', the killing fields, the torture centres and the loss of some 2 million Cambodian lives.In his memoirs, former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger has denied that the U.S. is at all responsible for the rise of the Khmer Rouge. But bitterly recounted descriptions of the bombings by survivors of the Khmer Rouge terror demonstrate that there is little to separate the U.S. bombings and Khmer Rouge brutality in the minds of Cambodian survivors. Who better to determine accountability than those who most directly suffered? It is impossible to say for certain, but such personal accounts are a powerful condemnation of the bombings and evidence that the U.S. government at the time was significantly responsible for what occurred thereafter.It is impossible to know for sure whether the bombing of Cambodia from 1969-73 led directly or indirectly, to massive suffering and the deaths of a full one-third of Cambodia's population at the time. But worse is the dysfunction caused by that tragedy which continues to profoundly affect Cambodian society to this day. I have been to Cambodia several times in recent years, and it was a very rare occurrence when I met anyone over 40 years of age.If you missed the Killing Fields when it was first released, or you were too young - or yet to be born - go search it out and watch a piece of truly horrifying history within living memory.",10,0,0,4 May 2016
The Revenant," Too many holes in the plot..
","Although heavily tipped to win, this film just missed out on winning the 'best film' Oscar but picked up a bunch of BAFTAS, including best film.I am of two minds about it. It is entertaining, and my Thai wife also enjoyed it, due to the sparsity of dialogue. After all, not a whole heap happens and the plot is easy to follow. The film is set in the 1820's in America's northern plains (The Dakotas) and it is a story of a fur trapping trip that goes horribly wrong.Leonardo DiCaprio plays a frontiersman and fur trapper who is employed as an expert guide to a team of desperate, wild and violent fur trappers, led by a US army captain. The trapper gang lose many of their fellow trappers when they are attacked by Indians. Subsequent to this, DiCaprio is all but killed by a bear protecting her cubs. He is left for dead.So far so good.After this, I have serious a credibility problem with the story. Everything that happens up to the point when DiCaprio is mauled by a bear tells us that not one of this gang of semi-lawless ruffians, including the US Army Captain, would have had any compunction in leaving their guide to die alone, once it became clear that he was not going to survive.They were in a desperate situation; they had already lost more than half their number to the Indians, the sub-zero weather was appalling, and they were in constant danger of further attacks.Would anyone in their right mind leave two men behind – separated from the safety of the main party to await Di Caprio's death, just to give him a proper burial? What about all the other men who died? I didn't see any of them getting a decent burial. Sorry, but that part of the story is sheer tosh and predicates the nonsense that follows.The baddie – Tom Hardy – volunteers to stay behind and watch over DiCaprio's demise, (for a bonus), but soon tires of this and buries him alive assuming he would soon die anyway. Even this lacks credulity – he didn't have any compunctions in killing DiCaprio's son and the second man who stayed with him. Why take a chance and leave Di Caprio in the hole to die? Why not finish him off?Of course, DiCaprio didn't die, and after numerous brushes with near death, he finally staggers into the fort, where the baddie takes off in a rush.By this time Di Caprio is near to death and painfully malnourished and weak from his horrendous adventures. Yet he is allowed to accompany the Captain to track down the baddie. Only two of them from the well- manned fort went after the baddie – the Captain and a barely alive DiCaprioSorry, again – total tosh!DiCaprio, Hardy and the rest of the cast play their parts admirably. The cinematography is astonishing and the story holds your attention. It's a good yarn with some great photography, but it's a long way from being a great movie. For starters, there's too many holes in the plot – it's a bit like a boys' own comic story.As for DiCaprio winning the best actor award – well apart from a few hoarse mutterings which are largely incomprehensible, he says very little. We can't see any 'acting expressions' because he is covered from head to foot with furs and shaggy beard throughout the entire movie. For sure, he does all that is asked of him, but is it really an Oscar-winning performance?I reckon that a mute person, equally clad with fur and beard could have done the part just as well. The few lines he utters could have easily been dubbed in and nobody would have been any the wiser. If it was anyone but DiCaprio in this part, I doubt whether the various academies would be raving about it. Do you win an Oscar for bravery and sleeping inside a dead horse or do you get it for acting?The Revenant is worth seeing, but if there's anyone in this movie who deserves an acting Oscar, it's the English baddie – Tom Hardy.",7,1,5,29 March 2016
Bridge of Spies," An enjoyable movie, but hardly worthy of an Oscar Nomination.
","I liked this movie and was drawn into the dramatic moments more than I would have ever thought possible. It is Stephen Spielberg's, cold- war, true tale of the Russian spy, Rudolf Abel, who was exchanged for the American U-2 Spy, Gary Powers.As with The Big Short, I didn't expect to enjoy this film, especially after one of my friends told me he found it quite boring. But I disagree with my friend. I think Spielberg and the writers did a good job with the facts that they had and succeeded in transforming a potential boring 'turn-off' into a rattling good yarn.The screenplay, along with great acting by Tom Hanks and Mark Ryland, and skillful directing and editing made this film a joy to watch. They made the most of their material, and I was surprised to discover that the events in the movie were closer to the truth than I had suspected to be the case.Filmmakers are notorious for making up events to spice up a true story (as in The Imitation Game), but in The Bridge of Spies they didn't need to – there was enough to work on.It is unclear to this reviewer whether Gary Powers deliberately opted not to take the poison pill.The CIA instructed him to take it if he was in danger of being captured. Was it an accident or a circumstance of misfortune? Now I come to the controversial part of my review.Bridge of Spies is an entertaining film and I was very happy to watch it in my own home. It certainly doesn't need a big cinema screen and I would put it on a par with any number of excellent 'made for TV movies' that have been released in recent years. If it had been made for TV, I am quite sure it would have picked up a truckload of Emmys.But an Oscar nomination for 'best picture'? Sorry, but I just don't see it. It is no better than the likes of 'The spy who came in from the cold' or 'The Ipcress file' or many other fine films set in the cold war, spy genre. (and none of these won any Oscars)The difference is that this one was directed by Spielberg and starred Tom Hanks.It would seem that The Oscar academy works in weird and wonderful ways, especially when black actors are concerned. I'm not sure about this year's black acting candidates, but last year it was a travesty that Selma was all but ignored by the academy.( Selma – now there was a great film that could have proudly gone down in history as Best Picture instead of the execrable Birdman, which nobody went to see except 'insider luvvies'.)",7,0,0,29 March 2016
Doctor Zhivago," This movie has celebrated its half-century birthday and it is still a wonderful example of the cinematic art.
","A good test of a classic film is not whether you can watch it again and again, but whether each time you watch it, you continue to get a little more out of it. There are very few movies that I will ever watch more than once, however good I think they are, unless many years have passed since my previous viewing. Such was the case with two old, classic movies that I recently decided to give a second run to. The first was David Lean's Doctor Zhivago, the epic Russian story set at the outbreak of the Russian revolution, based on the novel by Boris Pasternak.Doctor Zhivago is a towering piece of movie making by the master British Director and is reckoned by many to be one of the finest movies ever made. Others maintain that although it is a brilliant movie, it is only third place in the 'David Lean top ten' behind the 'Bridge over the River Kwai' and, of course, the multi-Oscar-winning 'Lawrence of Arabia'.I do not agree that it is the best movie ever made and I also reserve judgement as to whether it is the best movie David lean ever made until I have re-visited 'his other two masterpieces; but it is certainly a towering piece of filmmaking and it held me enthralled for the entire 3 hours and 20 minutes! I found the end part of the story which is a sort of epilogue, where the action jumps forward to the (then) present day, a bit confusing, a little tiresome, somewhat contrived, and lacking in any real drama. But I am being picky, for what went before is truly inspirational. The cinematography is breath-taking, and the acting, for the most part, was superb. In particular, I thought Julie Christie, as Lara, was incredibly ravishing and it was probably her finest ever acting role. Rod Steiger was also brilliant as the menacingly, evil, drunken whore- monger, Komarovsky. In spite of all his faults, you couldn't help empathising with him, for you could feel his compassion, despite what he did and what he stood for. Maybe I like him because I just adore these tragic, passionate, hard drinking, whoring Soviets.I thought that Omar Sharif played his role okay without really doing much to commend his acting prowess. He looked and sounded the part – so it worked – but in reality, he was just playing himself and 'walking' through the role. Watching the movie some 50 years later, I feel he was definitely a weak link in the chain. He comes across as a bit amateurish and 'dated' and if Lean was casting this movie today, I doubt if Sharif would have got a look in.But I am being picky again. This movie has celebrated its half-century birthday and it is still a wonderful example of the cinematic art. It garnered 10 Oscar nominations and won six, including best screenplay, best cinematography and best music - which included that beautiful theme by Maurice Jarre. It is a travesty that Lean did not pick up the best director gong.I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a romantic, exciting, tear- jerking love story that is set in the epic landscapes of Russia during the tumultuous days of the revolution. A must see for all movie lovers.",9,2,3,6 May 2016
Silver Linings Playbook," There is much to like in this endearing collection of oddballs.
","I am not a particular fan of 'Rom-Coms' unless they are very good and very funny – and very few of them ever are. This movie is not too bad at all. I watched it with my wife and we both thoroughly enjoyed it. It tells the story of a bi-polar hero, Pat, recently released from mental hospital after beating up his wife's lover, and his attempts to win his wife back. It also tells of his growing relationship with Tiffany, a similarly afflicted bi-polar young lady who wishes to compete in a dancing competition, and somehow persuades Pat to be her partner.It is well written, with a number of original twists, well-acted and it succeeded in keeping our interest throughout – rooting for the predictable outcome. I confess that I found some of the early action irritating as there is little doubt that Pat's outbursts of anger and violent behaviour should have resulted in his re-incarceration, yet the local cop does nothing – very odd. But I guess I am being picky, as there is much to like about this endearing collection of oddballs – from his wacky OCD friend - inmate Danny who keeps escaping and pretending that he has been legally released.Bradley Cooper is very good in the lead role and I just loved Jennifer Lawrence as his bipolar dancing partner. She is a sexy, amiable and a very good actress. I am a long-time fan of Robert de Niro and for me he can do no wrong – a bit like Al Pacino. So yet again he acquits himself incredibly well as the gambling mad father who puts everything he owns on the result of a football game and his son's dancing results.(A parlayapparently) It's all great fun and the movie deserves it plaudits. Did it deserve its Oscars? Hmm not too sure about that.",8,0,1,19 April 2016
Dallas Buyers Club," You will feel uplifted by the film's portrayal of the indomitable human spirit. Go for it.
","This is a difficult film to watch, as the subject matter is very grim and it hails back to those scary, depressing years of the mid- eighties when people across the world were dropping like flies with alarming frequency, after contracting HIV-AIDS. Although there is still no absolute cure for AIDS, significant medical progress has been made since those terrible years and these days many people with access to the latest drugs are able to live almost normal lives for many years, and have pretty much normal life-spans.The film is based on the true story of Ron Woodroof, a Texan homophobic electrician, and rodeo performer, who contracted AIDS in the early 80's. He was given thirty days to live by a local hospital but succeeded in remaining alive for seven more years by illegally importing and taking unapproved drugs. Along the way, he starts the Dallas Buyers Club, which is a device by which he is able to provide illegal drugs to fellow sufferers free of charge in return for paying a club membership fee. He also modifies his homophobic attitude and he strikes up a close friendship with a transvestite who becomes his business partner.Rumbling along in the background of this tale is Woodruff's battle with the authorities, particularly the FDA, who have serious objections to his drug buying and distribution activities and continually battle to shut him down, put him in jail and deprive him and others of drugs that can clearly prolong their lives. It has taken more than 20 years to bring this story to the screen, which is hardly surprising, given the seemingly unappealing storyline. When it finally went into production, it had a scant budget of only $5.5 million and the entire film was shot in a mere 25 days.Yet this low-budget film that was put together in less time than it takes most film producers to choose their cast has so far grossed $27million in the USA as at April 2014 and no doubt continued to put countless more 'bums on seats' in the following months. It garnered 6 Oscar nominations and won three, including Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor.Dallas Buyers Club is a shining example of one of my favourite hobby-horses - that Hollywood doesn't need to spend obscene amounts of money to make good, successful films – but that's an argument for another day. In my opinion, Dallas Buyers Club succeeds because, in spite of the deeply depressing subject matter, it tells the story of a man who refuses to meekly accept his predicted demise, and rails against the bureaucracy and authorities who would have him pass away quickly and without a fuss. By taking things into his own hands, he not only prolongs his own life, but also those of his fellow sufferers. It is a classic David and Goliath story: a dying, badly educated, Texan hick, against the might of the American government.But none of the above would have made the film stand out from the crowd if it wasn't for the quite extraordinary performance in the lead role by Mathew McConaughey. It really is a 'tour de force.' Not only did McConaughey look the part, (he lost so much weight that he must have been in imminent danger of collapsing from malnutrition), but he positively acted his hind teeth off.In my personal opinion, I did think that the portrayal of Woodroof's extreme and outrageously homophobic behaviour at the start of the movie was a bit over the top. If we accept the fact that he was a bigoted, ignorant Texan, it just didn't ring true (to me) that such an intolerant homophobe could dramatically change his ultra-extreme views in such a short space of time – even given the unique circumstances. To my surprise, after I had seen the movie, I found that my views are indeed valid.Amongst others, there is an article in The Dallas Morning News, commenting on the accuracy of the film, which states that:'people who knew him said that he was not homophobic While Woodroof was known for outlandish behaviour, according to those who knew him both the film and McConaughey made him rougher than he actually was, describing him as 'outrageous, but not confrontational' and not as obviously homophobic earlier in his life.'The opening scenes, in which Woodroof is mind-bogglingly abusive towards gays and the gay community, are amongst the most uncomfortable to watch in the whole movie. I can kind of see the justification in showing a dramatic contrast between his original homophobia with his later, more moderate behaviour, but I do think it is a shame that this aspect of the story is patently untrue. It seems to have been a cynical ploy to get more bums on seats. This is my only criticism, as the film romps along at a good pace and holds your interest throughout, so if you think this is the kind of dramatic movie that might tickle your fancy, then you could do a lot worse than Dallas Buyers Club.It is well directed, beautifully acted, (not only by McConaughey, but also by the rest of the much-talented cast), and although you suspect the final outcome, it doesn't detract from a genuine desire to know how it all goes down. You will empathise with the victims of this dread disease and most viewers will feel uplifted by the film's portrayal of the indomitable human spirit.Go for it!",9,2,2,10 April 2016
The Grand Budapest Hotel," It is all contrived and utterly sterile.
","For many film buffs, Wes Anderson is a brilliant director who can do no wrong. For me, his films may be full of technical marvels and are very clever, but for all that, they leave me cold. For many, his films are hilarious. For me, some of his so-called comedic episodes may raise the odd smile but for the most part, his attempts at humour are too calculated and come across as completely lacking spontaneity – the very antithesis of how comedy should appear to be. For many, his films are a rich and rewarding experiences. For me, they lack emotion and passion, and any real drama. One cares not one iota about the fate of the principal players and one sheds not a tear when things go bad.It is all contrived and utterly sterile.I'm sorry, but that's the way I feel. Maybe I am just too old to appreciate this apparent genius of 21st-century cinema, whose latest flick has so far garnered 4 Golden Globe nominations, (best film, best director, best actor, best screenplay), and 10 BAFTA nominations, (best film, best actor, best screenplay, best cinematography and many more).Indeed, I had to trawl through many pages of ten-star user reviews before I found one that said the film 'lacks substance and interesting characters' and another, which was entitled: 'Can I have my money back?'Well, I really wouldn't go that far – not that I pay for my movies anyway.The story is about a concierge at a famous European hotel between the wars that is crumbling and has seen better days, and a lobby boy who becomes his most trusted friend. The theft and recovery of a priceless painting and the battle for an enormous family fortune are at the heart of the actionTo be fair, it was a vaguely amusing movie – very quirky and visually provocative – which sort of held my interest, without in any way drawing me in or making me thirst for more.The two lead actors: Ralph Fiennes as the concierge and Tony Revolori as the lobby boy do more than justice to their roles, as do all the large number of 'name' actors who take on cameo roles – not that I recognised most of themBut the film is a piece of fluff and for some reason it brings to mind that other piece of highly over-rated mediocrity, 'Lost in translation' which garnered a feast of awards a decade ago.I'm sorry – I get Mike Lee, Woody Allen, David Lynch, Spike lee, Ethan Cohen, Quentin Tarantino and a whole gamut of quirky, off the wall directors, but I really don't get Wes Anderson.Maybe it's just me.So in the interests of fairness, let me conclude this review by reprinting the closing paragraph of the Guardian's review:'What slices the surface is the rapier- sharp wit, with Fiennes on point at all times, a dashing foil for his director's comedic cut and thrust.'There now you know.",5,4,6,7 April 2016
Foxcatcher," Truth is much stranger than fiction in this very high-quality bio-pic.
","Yet another bio-pic. Well, anyway, it is based on true events.I didn't think I was going to enjoy this film very much but almost from the start, I was hooked.It is the fascinating story of the relationship between an upper- class, eccentric multi-millionaire, ( John du Pont), and two working-class, champion wrestlers. The two brothers are already Olympic champion wrestlers at the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles and Dupont wants to spearhead their bid for more medals in the 1988 Games in Seoul.Du Pont persuades the younger of the two brothers (Mark Schultz) to join his wrestling training team, Foxcatcher, and to go and live in his state of the art training facility, which he built as annex to the family mansion. For the first time, Mark rises out of the shadow of his much wiser and revered trainer-brother, Dave.Du Pont also wants Dave, and for a while, Dave refuses all Du Pont's efforts to recruit him to the team along with his younger brother. After a series of 'issues' with Mark, DuPont eventually persuades Dave and his family to come and join his brother at the training centre.The father/son relationship which had developed between Mark and Du Pont is shattered and Mark becomes embittered and withdraws into himself as Dave takes over his brother's role and becomes the main trainer of the team.The 1988 Olympics go badly for Mark and he leaves Du Pont's training camp, later to be followed by his brother. Unfortunately, neither of them quite realised just how crazy Du Pont had become and Dave pays for it with his life.That this is an off-beat movie , there is no doubt; but as the good folk say, truth is much stranger than fiction and never was that more the case than in this very high-quality movie.We have a number of fascinating relationships to saliva over: the brotherly love between Dave and Mark; the Du Pont/ Mark, father-son relationship, followed by the break-up of that relationship after Dave's arrival in the training camp. Last, but by no means least, we have the almost Dickensian relationship between Du Pont and his mother; who he could never satisfy and who held an enormous controlling spell over him until her dying day.It seems to be the case that once Du Pont was free of his mother's controlling influence; his inherent mental instability went into over-drive.The film is reasonably faithful to what happened in real life, although the timeline in the movie has been very much shortened from the real one. I don't believe this detracts from the integrity of the story and in most important respects, the film faithfully relates how this tragedy played out.There is nothing in this movie with which I can find fault and it is certainly worthy of an Oscar nomination for best movie, which it didn't receive, along with best director, which it did.As for the actors – all of them play blinders, but you have to single out Steve Carell as Du Pont who acts out of his skin. And an honourable mention to Vanessa Redgrave who played Du Pont's mother.",9,3,4,1 April 2016
Gone Girl," It will leave you in the sure knowledge you had just spent two and a half, very enjoyable hours
","David Fincher, the director who brought us Fight Club, Seven, Benjamin Button and Social network has delivered another corker. This time, it is a very long, noir-ish thriller but I promise you, that it will hold your attention for its entire 149 minutes of running time. Gone Girl will leave you in the sure knowledge you had just spent two and a half, very enjoyable hours and thirsting for more.I hate to admit it, (for reasons I will not go into here), but just about every film that Ben Affleck has starred in is a winner in my book. This stylish actor always acts his heart out, without ever going over the top. His quiet, understated performances beat histrionics hands down, and in Gone Girl, playing Nick, the 'wronged' husband, Affleck has done it again. Rosamund Pike, who I do not recall having seen before, plays Amy, Nick's wife who suddenly and inexplicably disappears from home on the fifth anniversary of their marriage.For a very short while, you think this is going to be a formulaic 'husband does away with wife' flick, but it isn't long before you realise that you are watching something far superior that develops into a cracking, original thriller. Nick is suspected of murdering his wife, but I will not say too much more about the plot for fear of spoiling it for you. The film is about a complex marriage in which one or possibly both partners have sociopathic tendencies. It is a dark thriller, with unexpected twists and turns which will keep you enthralled and glued to your seats.I particularly enjoyed the role of the media in this movie, which turned the news of the wife's disappearance into a media circus. We were treated to the very epitome of a typical Fox News item; a brassy female presenter has already decided that the husband is a murderer. Together with her fawning 'expert legal contributors', she becomes judge and jury and turns Nick into public enemy No.1, before anyone even knows for sure whether the wife is really dead.The film switches between two time periods: the present day, as the police search for the wife and Nick becomes the prime suspect; and five years earlier, when the couple first meet and we learn, by courtesy of Amy's diary, how their marriage slowly starts to fall apart.The music is excellent, as is the cinematography, and the acting by a talented, supporting cast is without fault. Indeed, there are no weak links in Gone Girl – either in the production or the plot – and we are swept along in a roller coaster of surprises right up to the final curtain. Even as the story concludes, there is a final, wry twist or two to provoke us as we watch the final credits.Definitely a flick worth a look-see.",9,2,4,9 April 2016
Django Unchained," What can I say? I love Quentin Tarantino and I love this movie!
","What can I say? I love Quentin Tarantino and I love this movie. It is very funny, very exciting, very shocking and very thought provoking. It is has a great script, is incredibly well acted, and it goes without saying the direction and cinematography are outstanding. Set in 1850, this 'Black Western', is the story of a German bounty hunter, who helps a freed slave to rescue his wife from a brutal Mississippi plantation owner. In his typical, Tarantino-esque way, the master film-maker amuses us with his dark, blood-curdling humour. In graphic detail, he reveals to us the horrendous barbaric cruelty of the darkest times in American history – the slave era.Particularly noteworthy were the performances of Jamie Foxx in the lead role, Christoph Waltz as the German bounty hunter, Leonardo DiCaprio in a spellbinding performance as the brutal plantation owner, (his best cinematic performance up to that point by a million miles), and Samuel L Jackson in an outrageous over the top 'Uncle Tom' performance as Stephen - Di Caprio's faithful slave-servant. A host of brilliantly played cameo roles also added to the overall quality of this 'must see' movie.I'm not claiming this is Tarantino's best movie- Pulp fiction, Reservoir Dogs and Kill Bill 1 take a lot of beating. But none of those excellent, ground-breaking movies received any Oscars, so why indeed should Django Unchained? Frankly, I can't answer that, except to state the obvious – Tarantino has never been accepted by the Hollywood community as one of their own – in spite of his movies' universal popularity and wide critical acclaim. Was it ever thus? To this reviewer, he is right up there with the best. Go and see it and be entertained, be shocked and see something that might shake you out of your lethargy. Even if you hate it, you cannot fail to be moved and provoked by it.",10,3,7,18 April 2016
The Theory of Everything," A good movie, but spoiled by some glaring omissions.
","The film is a biopic of Steven Hawking and concentrates on his personal relationships from his undergraduate days, right up to the present day, although this passage of time is never made entirely clear.I have an inbuilt aversion to biopics, so it will take a very good one to get me going and hold my attention. But at least I can be thankful as I was spared the usual nonsense of actors ageing before my eyes by the clever application of make-up, prosthetics, different hair styles, older clothing and so on. For me that never works - the aged characters just look like young characters in heavy make-up.We watch as the admirable Eddie Redmayne, who plays Hawking, slowly becomes physically afflicted by the crippling motor neurone disease, without visibly ageing. His wife, Felicity Jones, also barely ages at all, and I suppose we should be thankful for that.It really is an astonishing performance by Redmayne and his co-star, Jones is not only very pleasing to the eye, but is also very believable as his loving and long-suffering wife. The leading pair really do act their hearts out. The film garnered a large number of award nominations, and Redmayne scooped up a host of gongs for best actor, including the coveted Oscar.There is a lot of emotion in The Theory of Everything and there were even moments in the movie that I admit brought tears to my eyes. For the most part, I remained immersed in this utterly touching love story.It is the story of one the world's greatest geniuses being struck down in his teenage years by a fatal disease – which would usually have meant a life expectancy of two years - and of his gallant wife, who insists on marrying him, and is determined to stick by him, no matter what.We see how Hawking is undeterred by his terrible disease and becomes a world famous genius and celebrity, and how in the end, it becomes too much for his wife, who is eventually 'replaced' by one of his adoring carers.It is a good movie and it taught me a few things about the great man that I had not previously known, and it also told me a great deal about the struggles in his personal life.Yet, I wasn't 100% sold on this admittedly superior biopic. When all's said and done, it is a biopic, and as with any biopic it is difficult for a film in this genre to rise to movie greatness.If it had been made for the History Channel, it would quite possibly been a better film, as certain aspects of the story wouldn't have been compromised for dramatic effect. As a piece of entertainment the film, which celebrates Hawking's genius and triumph over impossible odds, is a success. As a biopic, telling us the life story of an extraordinary man, it is deeply flawed.For starters, there was an unanswered question that stuck with me throughout the movie. Why is Hawking still alive in his 70's when most sufferers of this disease die within two years after the onset of the illness? The question was never asked or discussed in any way, yet I imagine in the real life, everyone would be asking such a question. How is it that he continues to live? How many more years can he survive?After much Google research, I eventually found an explanation – but I shouldn't have had to do all that I'm quite sure that I'm not the only one who was puzzled by this glaring omission.Even more annoying were the parts of his life story that were deliberately omitted and which I wasn't aware of until I read Hawking's Wikipedia page.There is a lot of detail in Wikipedia that is not included in the movie, including the need for a team of nurses to provide round the clock care to Hawking from a very young age. We didn't see so much as a single nurse in the entire movie – except when he was in hospital. We were left very much with the impression that his wife provided all the care, single-handed, although quite how she did it, with her need to bring up 3 children and study for a degree was never explained.Even worse was the omission of Hawking's relationship with one of his carers which turned so sour that there is a strong suspicion that he was abused. This eventually resulted in police intervention and for a few years, he became seriously estranged from his ex-wife and children. There is much more in his private life that is not mentioned and although the film deals sensitively with the breakdown of Hawking's first marriage, all the nasty, unpleasant stuff is well and truly swept under the carpet. The truth is well and truly sanitised. If it is supposed to be a biopic – then it does us a disservice.So as long as movie-goers understand that the movie is 'roughly based' on 'parts' of the life of Hawking, then go watch it and enjoy it. For me, it's a shame that such a good opportunity to tell the world about the real Stephen Hawking - warts an' all - has been wasted.",8,0,0,7 April 2016
Room," It's a pretty good movie
","Room is a pretty good movie. It is based on a novel by Emma Donoghue who also penned the film script. It is the story of a woman who was locked up and sexually abused for 7 years inside a 10 ft. by 10 ft. shed.It is also the story of her 5-year-old son who was born and raised inside the 'room' with no knowledge of the outside world. He assumes that the small television set they watch every day is just 'make believe'.The story is sometimes difficult to watch as we see mother and son play out their daily lives in this room, where the male perpetrator appears at night to have his way with mom while little Jack sleeps in the closet. They are both totally under the control of this evil, sexual pervert and there seems no hope for them.I confess that I was worried that the entire movie would take place in the 'room', as after about 45 minutes I was starting to become tired of watching such unspeakable misery. Fortunately, my concerns were unfounded. Jack manages to escape by pretending he is dead. The cops find Jack and glean enough information from him to work out where the shed is located. The rest, as they say, is history.The final part of the film is devoted to the trials and traumas of Jack and his mom adapting to the real world at the family home of his grandparents.The film handles this sensitively and realistically, although I would certainly take issue with the shocking and invasive questioning by a TV reporter, even though Mom was being paid for the interview. Even in today's sensationalist America, where just about anything goes, an interview like this would never be allowed to happen to such a distressed and traumatised woman – money or no money.I don't know why, but I could tell that the film was adapted from a book. Some of the events – such as Jack rolling himself up in a carpet probably works well in a book but less well on screen. It didn't ring true. Maybe I'm nit-picking, as generally speaking, the film works well and holds your attention throughout.Jacob Tremblay, as Jack, acts out of his skin and Brie Larson, as the mother, is also excellent and does everything that could be expected of her in the acting department. But for this reviewer, she wasn't the best actress amongst those nominated this year for an Oscar, even though she won. But there againI'm probably biased.",8,1,3,31 March 2016
The Hurt Locker," I can certainly recommend The Hurt Locker to anyone who appreciates a well-produced, above-average, dramatic, soul-searching piece of filmmaking.
","The Hurt Locker, about an American bomb disposal squad operating in Iraq, has more than its fair share of blood-thirsty action, but ultimately, it is about the members of the squad and how their dangerous jobs affected them.There have been many criticisms levelled at this movie concerning factual inaccuracies within the 'nuts and bolts' of the story. It has been said that such bomb squads did not operate in the manner depicted in the movie and certain events could never have happened in the way portrayed. I have some sympathy for this criticism, for if you are making a deadly serious movie about a recent historical event that is still burning in the hearts and consciousness of many, then I do feel the producers have a duty not to deliberately misrepresent the truth. However, in general, I doubt whether the so-called inaccuracies had any serious impact on the film, as the story is about the people, not about the correctness of the technical operations. Indeed, many within the military have praised it as a work of 'admitted fiction' that does much to illustrate the horrors of war and the effect on brave soldiers in the front line – whatever their nationalities happen to be.I can certainly recommend The Hurt Locker to anyone who appreciates a well-produced, above-average, dramatic, soul-searching piece of filmmaking.These days, most of us have become desensitized to the mass killings that are shown 24/7 in TV news reports from conflicts around the world. If this isn't enough, we are also assailed on every side by fictional violence that is stuffed down our throats by Hollywood and the TV producers, looking to improve ratings. But despite this regular gluttony of death and violence, The Hurt Locker really gets through to us movie-goers - we are there with them - as is evidenced by a rich haul of six Oscars, including best film, best director, and best screenplay.",9,0,1,5 May 2016
Lincoln," This pivotal event in American history deserves something a little better.
","This is not so much a bio-pic of Lincoln's life or indeed his four odd years as president of The USA. It is purely an account of the last few months of his life, during which he succeeds in achieving the passage of the landmark constitutional amendment, which forever banned slavery in the United States. It is the story of Lincoln's incredible battle to get this amendment passed, with the requisite two-thirds majority in the House of Representatives, seemingly against all odds. The background to this event is the final months of the brutal civil war, during which no less than three-quarters of a million people were killed. The amendment must be passed before the peace treaty is signed as the southern states would then vote against it. The president is torn. An early peace would certainly save thousands of lives. As the nation confronts its conscience over the freedom of its entire population, Lincoln faces his own crisis of conscience – end slavery or end the war.You could hardly have more epoch-making subject matter, and it is not surprising that Steven Spielberg chose this as his latest blockbuster – clearly inspired by one of America's greatest ever Presidents. It seems to me also timely and appropriate that today's American audiences should be taken back to a time, less than 200 years ago, when slavery was still part of their nation; and when they had leaders as brilliant, inspiring and selfless as Lincoln to lead them down the right path. With such an inspiring story, such a legendary director and one of the 'greatest living actors' it could hardly fail – and by all accounts it didn't. Lincoln was released to wide acclaim, and it won the best actor Oscar for Daniel Day-Lewis. As is often my want, I go completely against accepted wisdom and declare that I found the movie quite boring. I was also singularly unimpressed by Day-Lewis's portrayal of Lincoln. I know I am being a philistine and maybe I'm letting my prejudices subvert my good judgement. I simply didn't find the 17th Century political machinations engaging - and this was the basis of the story. Neither was I impressed by Lewis' whining, mock 'hick' Yankee accent. It just didn't ring true to this movie watcher. I get more worked up watching Washington partisan intrigues on cable news than I did by watching Spielberg's Lincoln. Maybe I've watched too much American political news – but either way, the film largely left me cold.And before my American friends accuse me of not treating this pivotal event in American history with the respect it deserves, let me just say that I have recently finished watching the wonderful PBS documentary of the entire Civil War by Ken Burns – all 12 odd hours of it; and I was totally mesmerised by the entire story – particularly Lincoln's part in it. I am a very interested and a 'concerned' student of this part of American history and I am a huge admirer of Lincoln, but for me, this movie just doesn't do him justice.There is no doubt that Steven Spielberg is one the world's finest living filmmakers, and 'Lincoln' is not a bad film. It is well acted - but not superlatively so - well directed and well filmed. It is a thoroughly professional job that is adequate, but no more. In my humble opinion, this hugely important story at a crucial time in American history deserves something a little better.",6,0,2,18 April 2016
The Imitation Game," Falls a bit short on a number of counts.
","With the excellent Benedict Cumberbatch in the lead role, The Imitation Game is a movie that aspires to movie greatness, but I'm sorry to say, that in my humble opinion, it falls a bit short on a number of counts.It is the story of the brilliant scientist/mathematician, Alan Turing who was the man who almost single-handedly cracked the enigma code machine in the Second World War. This remarkable feat is generally acknowledged to have shortened the war by at least two years and saved thousands upon thousands of lives.It is also the story of a man who has been credited with the invention of the modern day computer.It is also the story of the man who was a homosexual, and who was prosecuted for committing (what were then considered to be) 'illegal' acts, and who subjected himself to state administered chemical castration rather than spend time in jail.It is also the story of a man who was treated so shabbily by the country who owed him so much that at the age of 39, he killed himself.It is a difficult story to tell in a couple of hours – especially when we know nothing about the really exciting part – the details of what exactly led up to Turing breaking of the enigma code during the war. We know he was hired to lead a team and he built and used a very primitive form of computer to break the code. More than that is still secret, or the records have long since been destroyed.The film writers decided to write what they thought was a clever piece of fiction in which Turing was continually fighting his bully- boy bosses; that his resentful, fellow workers all thought he was an idiot; that he was wasting valuable funds, and was probably a Russian spy. According to the film, he was at constant at risk of being fired.All the above is fiction. Indeed, they would have us believe that that it was only after Turing wrote directly to Churchill that he was put in charge and granted the funds to build his computer. (Fiction again.)It really is a load of tosh, and Charles Dance's role as Turing's ignorant, malevolent commanding Officer is so full of 'cartoon- evil', that for all the world, he comes across as a male manifestation of Creuella Deville. One of the most outrageous fictitious story lines concerns Turing's failure to report a Soviet spy to avoid being outed as gay. It is pure Hollywood invention, as are so many of the dramatic machinations that allegedly took place at Bletchley Park.It is a pity, as although I really don't like biopics unless they are very good – this might have been an exception, but sadly it isn't. The film didn't seem to know what it wanted to do – celebrate the genius of a man who shortened the war by two years and invented the computer, or show us how gays, even war heroes, were so appallingly treated by the authorities in Britain back in the early 50's. I think it tries to do both and falls a bit flat on both countsIt is still a very watchable, entertaining movie, and Cumberbatch and Dance are always worth seeing – whatever films they are in, as is the gorgeous Keira Knightley. But I don't think Benedict quite nailed the role – maybe he tried a little too hard. It just isn't that good. Honestly – I've seen a couple of documentaries on Turing that are much better. Incidentally, it is a fact that Churchill later acknowledged Turing's massive contribution to the war effort, which shortened the war by at least two years, but no mention was made of the disgraceful way he was treated in the early 1950's because he was gay.Turing was recently pardoned by the then PM Gordon Brown for his 'crime' of being a practicing homosexual, but isn't it about time he was posthumously awarded a knighthood? After all, he is one of Britain's greatest ever heroes. If the likes of Cliff Richard, Mick Jagger and Bruce Forsyth and Angelina Jolie can become Knights and Dames of the Realm, then surely Alan Turing is equally deserving of the honour.",7,0,4,28 March 2016
The Hangover Part II," Quite possibly one of the worst films I have ever seen.
","'Hangover Part II', is an American offering, which probably cost a small fortune to make and also did amazingly well at the box office. I had no excuse for watching it, as every single review panned it mercilessly; and well should they have done. I had previously seen Hangover 1, which although fairly banal, did contain some good, original humour and was well acted by the main protagonists.As those who have read about Hangover II or, like me, have had the misfortune to watch it will know, the sequel simply uses all the gags from the first movie. It transplants them to some kind of crazy, make- believe Asian state, occasionally referred to as Thailand, (although the local people are referred to as 'Asiatics' not Thai), but which bears no resemblance to any country that I have ever had the misfortune to live in.Not that this would matter if the film was entertaining; but it isn't. It is total, unadulterated crap without a single redeeming feature.Quite possibly one of the worst films I have ever seen.",1,0,1,24 April 2016
Selma," A movie truly worthy of multi-awards but largely ignored by white, wealthy Americans of a certain age.
","At long last a movie worthy of Oscar nominations. Yet it was totally ignored by the BAFTAS and only received two Golden Globes nominations, (neither of which it won), and only a single major Oscar nomination, but at least we can be grateful it was for 'best movie'. Out of all the films I saw for the 2014 Oscar nominations, Selma should have won the 'Best Movie', hands down, as should Selma's director, and lead actors in the best acting categories.Selma is the story of a three-month period in 1965 when Martin Luther King campaigned to secure equal voting rights for blacks by making an epic, non-violent, but 'illegal' march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama.The movie is labelled a bio-pic – but is it really?To me, a bio-pic tells the story of someone's' life – or least a good part of a person's life. A three month period in someone's life – however momentous, is more the story of a true event than the story of a life, which in the case of King's life, included numerous other momentous events. But let's not get hung up on semantics.I was nineteen years old in 1965, and I still recall the event which was covered widely by the British media. I believe that everyone from Britain and the United States who cares about this troubled world we live in today, should see Selma, as indeed they should see 12 Years a Slave, the Oscar winner in 2013.Why?Because we in Britain were prime participants in the abominable slave trade that brought millions of Africans to America in the first place, and because Americans can see how, within living memory, blacks were still being treated as inferior human beings and were miss-treated, tortured and even killed with impunityWe should keep this fact in the back our minds when we look at the horrors of the 21st Century, in Syria, Iraq, Nigeria and elsewhere. Not so long ago, we used to do some pretty inhuman things to our fellow human beings ourselves. Maybe that knowledge will help us to understand that there always have been – and always will be – very evil people in this world who, if left to their own devices, will perpetrate unspeakable acts of violence to their fellow men. The Nazis killed 6 million Jews less than 90 years ago and the 'killing fields' of Biafra, Rwanda, Bosnia and so many more abominations have occurred in even more recent times.Yes, we should do well do dwell on man's inhumanity to man.It seems incredible that during my own lifetime, blacks in America were denied basic equal rights; banned from 'white' hotels, denied entrance to 'white' schools and, critically, were denied the vote in many southern States. They were also regularly strung up and hanged by the Klu Klux Klan.Martin Luther King's historic march from Selma to Montgomery was an event that was initially stopped in its tracks by ruthless state troopers. They did this by charging at the would-be marchers on horseback; by beating them mercilessly with clubs, and even shooting and killing them.When, in its third attempt, the march finally succeeded in taking place, it was one of the 20th century's most momentous and iconic happenings. It resulted in the then US President, Lyndon B Johnson, passing a bill that removed all voting barriers for blacks.American readers may think that I only support movies with predominantly British cast, but nothing could be further from the truth. Selma was made by first-time feature-length film director, Ava DuVernay'; a female, black American. She is clearly the major mover and inspiration for this film and what a wonderful job she has made of it.As indeed does the British Actor David Oyelowo as King; as does British actor Carmen Ejogo as King's wife; as does British actor Tom Wilkinson as LBJ; as does British actor Tim Roth as Governor George Wallace. All British, but all so American in their roles.Why DuVernay didn't cast Americans in these roles, I can only guess at, but it doesn't really matter.For me, not only should DuVernay have been nominated for best director, but so should have all the above-listed actors in their respective acting categories. Tim Roth as George Wallace is a stunning revelation trust me.I am glad to see that the song 'Glory' is up for best song, as it is a soaring and inspirational melody – but even that was ignored by BAFTA.Shame on the BAFTA and Oscar Academies! What is wrong with you? Surely this lack of nominations isn't all about 'race' raising its ugly head again is it? I read somewhere that the Oscar academy was turned off Selma when the left-leaning Democrats, (which comprise a majority of the voting academy), put it out that the film did not show one of their favourite Democratic Presidents, LBJ, in a very flattering light.Considering how Hollywood routinely twists real life events to suit their own ends, this is utter hypocrisy on a grand scale. Never mind that the film is about one America's all-time heroes, ignore it because it casts a few aspersions on a long dead, white, Democratic President.Well, I guess many of these faded stars from yesteryear who make up the academy voters are all as egotistical as that 'Birdman' character. That's why they loved Birdman so much and disliked Selma. I reckon the only reason Selma was put up in the single category of best film was to avoid charges of being racist.If you see only one movie in the next twelve months, make it Selma – you will not be disappointed.",10,1,5,7 April 2016
Les Misérables," Rule number one is to get people who can sing.
","Firstly let me say up front that I am a huge fan of musical theatre, and if pushed would concede that 'Les Mis' is probably my all-time favourite musical, edging just ahead of other favourite shows such as Evita, Miss Saigon, Cats and West Side Story and Carousel. I have seen it twice in the West End of London and have watched concert performances of the musical countless times on DVD's, both the Royal Albert Hall anniversary concert and the more recent 'O2 Arena' anniversary concert. Both are fabulous shows to watch and listen to on TV and the music is inspiring as ever. It was therefore with tremendous anticipation and excitement that I went to see Les Miserables – the movie, especially as it had received a great number of rave reviews.Sorry folks – I was really disappointed. By far and away the main reason for my disappointment was the woeful miscasting of the lead roles – particularly Russell Crowe as Javert and Hugh Jackman as Jean Valjean. For some totally mind boggling logic, the producers chose fame over singing ability. This is the musical which probably more than any other, requires truly exceptional, professional singers in the lead roles. Frankly, it would have been better if proper singers were used to lay down the sound-tracks and these two karaoke 'also runs' mimed to the singing. After all, Natalie Wood got away with it in West Side Story. Hugh Jackman, while admittedly singing more or less in tune, is extremely pedestrian in every one of the towering, emotionally demanding songs. His whiny, nasally, weak voice just didn't cut it – at all! I bet your local amateur dramatic group could have come up someone who could give a better performance. As for Crowe! The least said about his singing the better. Let me just say that one of my all-time favourite songs from the show is 'Stars', and when sung by a half way decent tenor, it never fails to move me to tears. Crowe's rendition only brought me to tears of despair and sorrow at the desecration of such a beautiful, inspiring piece of music. The man cannot sing worth a damn!I can't really comment on the 'close-up' filming, the live recording of vocals or the overall direction of the movie – I suppose it seemed to come across OK – because I was just too blown out by the terrible singing to be able to think too much about anything else, or take an objective view about what I was watching. And let's not for one moment try to argue that stage musicals can never make good film musicals as that is patently untrue. I recently re-visited the movie Evita with Madonna in the lead role, and say what you will about Madonna, but she really lifted her game in Evita and performed magically. Antonio Banderas as Che Guevara and Jonathan Pryce as Peron were also brilliant choices and sang their hearts out to perfection.The film version of Evita should have shown any budding filmmakers just how to adapt a stage musical for the silver screen. Evita is so much better than Les Miserables in every conceivable way. And just in case you think that Evita, (1996), is the exception, I would refer you to multiple Oscar winners like Oliver, (1968), and the still incredible West Side Story, (1961). It can be done, but rule number one is to get people who can sing – or if not, dub them! 'Nuff said!",5,4,7,18 April 2016
Zero Dark Thirty," The only member of the cast who came shining though the dross was James Gandolfini in a cameo role.
","This is the true story of the decade-long hunt for Al-Qaeda terrorist leader Osama bin Laden after the September 2001 attacks, and his death at the hands of the Navy S.E.A.L.s in May 2011. I am not a fan of this type of movie, and I regard Zero Dark Thirty is the same 'type' of movie as 'Argo'; both involve CIA sponsored special assignments in hostile territory, one involving a rescue and the other involving a capture. Unfortunately Argo succeeded, where Zero Dark Thirty fell utterly flat. By the time these gallant American forces were traipsing through Bin Laden's compound in almost total darkness, I for one had lost all interest in the eventual outcome – and in any case I already knew exactly what happened.I can certainly see why the so-called 'establishment' and even the White House are not too happy about the amount torture scenes in the movie. I happen to be in the school of thought that just maybe in very extreme circumstances, a degree of psychological torture, which could include the use of water, may be justified. However, I was frankly shocked at the amount footage devoted to some pretty brutal torture scenes at the start of the movie. I have no idea how accurate this was, but to have something approaching 30 minutes of torture footage seemed to be overdoing it a bit, and it really wasn't very entertaining.The movie then jumped somewhat disjointedly through the next decade, with our gallant heroine almost single-handedly and doggedly pursuing the trail to Bin laden with just about everyone else around her writing her off as a bit of a crackpot. Whether this is accurate or whether the writers used a degree of poetic licence to make the story more interesting, I couldn't say, and I don't really care. No matter how hard the filmmakers tried, I just couldn't invest any excitement in the whole process. We knew all knew where it would end and nothing happened to capture our interest or imagination in the meantime. Most, if not all the characters were 'one dimensional' caricatures; either Islamic terrorists or cynical, hard-bitten CIA operatives. I read somewhere that the popular TV terrorist series 'Homeland' was akin to a pathetic comic book when compared to the exciting action in Zero Dark Thirty. I beg to differ. Homeland is an exciting action movie with characters you can relate to and believe in. It is vastly to superior to Zero Dark Thirty.OK, Zero Dark Thirty is a true story, so that makes it more difficult to invent exciting plot twists, but that doesn't prevent the producers from doing much better with what they had – after all what could be a better story than the capture and killing of one of the most horrific and reviled terrorist leaders the world has ever known? As for character development – Zero dark zero. The writer would have done well to study the character of 'Carrie', the heroine in Homeland as a template for their fleshing out of Maya, the heroine of Zero Dark Thirty. Jessica Chastain did the best she could with the material available, but if sitting alone in a huge cargo plane after she had completed her assignment was supposed to move us all to tears, then she and director Bigelow had better think again. The only member of the cast who came shining though the dross was James Gandolfini in a cameo role as the CIA Director.As the long movie plodded to its grim anti-climax, my wife went to watch the news on another TV. She was lucky - the closing scenes were the worst of all. It was so dark and shadowy that most of the time you couldn't work out what in God's name was going on. They kept running around the compound, mumbling inaudibly, occasionally blowing open doors and even more occasionally killing someone. We were given no clues as to part of the compound they were in or how far away they were from where Bin Laden was located, or who were the people being killed. After about ten minutes of all this confusing shooting and mumbling in the dark, we no longer cared.We saw women screaming and kids being shepherded into bedrooms, but we didn't know who they were and we still didn't know where Bin Laden was. Finally a man whose face was off camera was somehow dragged to the ground and shot. We never saw his face, only the very bottom part of his beard and we never saw any of the real action that we know took place, as the Americans took great pride in telling it all to the world, immediately after they shot him. On the other hand we saw in the grimmest and most microscopic detail the torture of detained terrorists and also the blowing up and shooting of innocent people, including CIA operatives by the jihadists.So we could see 'our side' being blown up and see all the wicked tortures in graphic detail but only dark, shadowy 'suggestions' of the last moments on Earth of Bin Laden. We didn't see his burial at sea and neither did we see Obama and his cabinet colleagues watching from the Whitehouse. I really hope they managed to get a better view of what took place than we the people did in this pathetic apology of a movie. I reiterate that I am not a particular fan of this type of movie genre, but even so, I thought that Director Kathryn Bigelow's 2008 movie 'Hurt Locker' was a good, highly watchable movie with well- drawn characters and deserved its best movie Oscar. In my humble opinion she really needs to go back to the drawing board and get her game together, as Zero Dark Thirty falls seriously short of what she previously achieved with Hurt Locker. I am aware that not many will agree with me.",5,0,2,19 April 2016
12 Years a Slave," it is one of those movies that not only Americans, but all the movie-going public needs to see.
","A true story provides the background for this tragic, and incredibly thought-provoking film. As many have already stated, there is a surprising dearth of feature films that deal with this most uncomfortable of subjects – slavery in the USA. Even more surprising – or maybe predictable, depending on your point of view – is that it has taken an English Director and largely European actors, to bring to the silver screen the tale of Solomon Northrup; a free black man living in upstate New York in the 1840's, who was kidnapped and sold into southern slavery. Director Steve McQueen, writer John Ridley, (an American), actors Chiwetel Ejiofor, Lupita Nyong'o, Michael Fassbender, Benedict Cumberbatch and the rest of the stellar cast have, without any doubt, produced an immensely moving and highly watchable film.Although there is much suffering, violence and cruelty depicted in the film, some say that the violence has been played down and that the reality of American slavery was much, much worse. Having recently Read Toni Morrison's 'Beloved', I don't doubt it. The Director and writer also acknowledge that this may be so, but clearly they had to ask themselves what exactly would be achieved by endless violence, brutality and death, except to provide personal gratification to some sections of the audience.Few films have been made on this subject, and by general consensus, none have been definitive. This being the case, the film-makers owed it to themselves – and their audience – to produce something that caught the essence of that troubled period of American history. They needed to show us what it was all about, without overwhelming the audience with an unremitting catalogue of unspeakable violence and depravity.What they did show us is that there was no such thing as 'good' white slavers, even though some may have seemed 'less bad' than others; and that there were plenty of really evil slavers whose behaviour was unspeakably monstrous. Then there were the hapless slaves themselves. The women were raped, their children were split up and sold away from their families and they were all kept in line by brutal intimidation and the fear of summary execution for even the slightest infraction. All the above – and more – is shown in this film. For some reason, the horrors of slavery seem even more real when seen through the terrified eyes of an educated black man who was once lucky enough to have known a different life.Twelve Years A Slave should be seen by every living American, just to remind them of how some of their not so distant ancestors behaved and to know about the unspeakable horrors that took place in their own country. They need to realise that this true event only happened a mere 150 years ago, and that slavery in their country still has ramifications within the social structure of present day USA. Even in my own lifetime, blacks in much of America were often abused, occasionally lynched and always treated as strictly second-class citizens.If I was a black man living in today's America, how would I feel about my slave ancestors? Would I feel that it was another time and another place and life had moved on since then? Or would I wonder what manner of humanity sought to subjugate my race, and as recently as fifty years ago, I wouldn't have been permitted to sleep in the same hotel, or sit on the same bus seat or eat in the same restaurant or attend the same school as my white, fellow-citizens.This is not a particularly easy film to watch, but it is one of those movies that not only Americans but all the movie-going public needs to see, as one way or another, it is all part of our shared history. Certainly us Brits - from where so many of the southern slavers' ancestors originated - have little to crow about, having been one of the main participants in the African slave trade for the best part of 300 years.Don't get me wrong, the film is entertaining and contains some towering, inspirational performances from the likes of Chiwetel Ejiofor, Lupita Nyong'o, and Michael Fassbender. It received 9 Oscar nominations and won for Best Picture, Best Supporting actress, and best-adapted screenplay. And it does have a happy ending, of sorts.Read more about this reviewer at mobithailand.com",10,0,3,10 April 2016
Whiplash," Whiplash is worth watching for the jazz music alone - pity about the drum solos!.
","When I reviewed 'Birdman' recently, I said that I am not a fan of drums solos. I have nothing against drums or drummers, and I understand that they are an integral, essential element of any popular band or group, but solos that last for more than about 10 seconds drive me – and many others – to distraction. Sorry, but I fail to see anything in a drum solo which can be considered musically stimulating, or inspirational, and the only thing I like about them is when I realise, with relief, that they are about to end.Sure, I understand very well that the likes of Buddy Rich, Ginger Baker and Keith Moon were talented geniuses and as long as they stuck to providing the background rhythm for the music, and playing together with the rest of the musicians, I enjoyed their drumming as much as the next man.But long drum solos are a load of old codswallop as far as I'm concerned.In one of my many former incarnations, I used to be a pop concert promoter and I still recall that just about every 'name' pop group when performing a live concert, would include a long drum solo in its set. It was only included so that the rest of the musos could go off stage to have a break, down a quick beer, drag on a joint or sniff a line of coke. The solo would last as long as it took for all these guys to return to their positions on stage, and it had little to do with musical prowess. It was just a time- filler. Later in the set, there would be the obligatory acoustic guitar/vocal duet to allow the drummer to disappear and partake of his own, personal adrenaline boosts.So Whiplash, which is about a budding drummer being knocked into shape (in more ways than one) by a teacher in a prestigious music school, was never going to be that well received by this reviewer.I'm probably going to invite open warfare by stating that in many respects, Whiplash is simply a superior remake of the cheesy 'Fame' movie franchise; albeit with a lot more gritty violence, some outstanding acting and some great jazz music.Indeed, in spite of the darkness of the plot, there were still some sentimental, cheesy moments, especially when the teacher went off the rails when one of his former students committed suicide. To me it was a bit corny - seen it all before - nothing like the off-screen death of somebody not in the movie to evoke a few tears and sympathy.As for the student walking away unscathed from a terrible car crash that would have killed most and – covered in blood – makes it to his drum stool, just in time to perform, only to find he forgot his drumsticks. Such machinations belong more in a cliff-hanger novel by Dan Brown than in an Oscar contender for best movie.But having said all that, I have to fess up and say that it was a pretty good movie and I quite enjoyed it – only glancing at my mobile phone a couple of times, when those bloody drum solos went on too long.It is the story of a young drummer-prodigy who is put through his paces at a respected music academy by a sadistic music teacher, who thinks nothing of slapping his student hard across his face or throwing things at him if his drumming tempo is too slow or too fast – neither of which is discernible by the naked ear.The underlying message, or question, is just how far anyone should go in the pursuit of greatness or perfection. We are regaled more than once with the story about the saxophone genius, Charlie Parker, who at the age of 16, was brought down to earth with a crash as he lost his way while improvising 'I Got Rhythm'. The drummer, Jo Jones, lobbed a cymbal at him in frustration, and the audience laughed and jeered. Parker stalked out of the venue and after a year of intensive practice, he returned and performed – as a character in Whiplash puts it – 'the best f—in' solo anyone in the room ever heard.'Whiplash is the story about what happens when a teaching mentor and his student prodigy are determined to go to any lengths, no matter how painful, to achieve success.(Sounds familiar? Fame, anyone?)You can guess what happens in the end, but along the way, there is some truly great acting by JK Simmons as the teacher, (what a voice ! Where's he been all my life?), and the student, Miles Teller.Whiplash is worth watching for the jazz music alone, but it might have been even better if it was about a saxophonist or a trumpet player or maybe a clarinetist – and not about a bloody drummer and his bloody drum solos",8,2,4,1 April 2016
The Wolf of Wall Street," The film is a graphic riot of sex orgies and drug-enhanced mayhem - But what's the point?
","I was really looking forward to this film, given that it is directed by one of my all-time favourite directors, Martin Scorsese, and boasts a stellar cast including the ever improving Leonardo De Caprio who played a blinder in last year's Django Unchained. As you might expect from Scorsese, 'Wolf' is certainly a visual feast and much of it is quite entertaining to watch. It is in a different class to American Hustle, but like 'Hustle', it suffers from a lack of 'audience empathy' for the lead character.There are endless films which have portrayed utterly unpleasant characters in leading roles and the trick of a good movie-maker is to know how to make us 'feel' for these 'bad' people – who might even be rapists or killers – as then we can understand, if not entirely excuse or forgive their transgressions. Sometimes we will see such villains get their comeuppance, which satisfies our sense of right and wrong, and occasionally the characters themselves become remorseful and change their previously evil ways. In some instances, 'baddies' continue their evil ways, but we are shown that even in the worst of people, there is something that we, the audience, can understand, that will encourage us to understand their horrific behaviour and to gain a modicum of our sympathy. Maybe they have severe mental problems, and so on. Hannibal Lecter is a good example as are Scorsese's movies, such as Goodfellas, Casino and Gangs of New York.But Wolf is not one of these. How can we have any sympathy or feeling for someone who delights in cheating mainly poor, working class folk in Wall Street security scams; indulging in the most extreme, drug- fuelled sexual misogyny; horrific wife-beating, amongst many more dire acts of deprivation? We are somehow supposed to admire this venal slime ball, who lives a life that even Caligula would have envied. Eventually, he even betrays his closest friends in an attempt to save his own skin. Sure, he ends up in jail, but considering all the ordinary folk who he swindled, 3 years wasn't exactly very long and as the film closes he was back to his old tricks, albeit in a different country where there were still some innocent punters who hadn't heard of his malevolent and immoral ways. The film is a graphic riot of sex orgies and drug-enhanced mayhem and there can be no better director than Scorsese to provide this kind of gratuitous feast to audiences presumably hungry for such soft-porn material. But much as one may be inclined to enjoy the scenes playing before our titillated and shocked eyes, we have to wonder whether it is all so necessary. What is the point? I for one do not believe that anyone could have been quite so outrageously reprehensible in his lifestyle as we are led to believe the Wolf was. If he was that bad, how in earth could he have ever got his act together sufficiently to cheat yet more people and run his huge, despicably corrupt organisation?De Caprio throws everything but the kitchen sink into his performance, but to me, it was totally over the top and frankly, unbelievable and without credibility. I think his role would have been more meaningful, and would even have gained some measure of sympathy from us if he had been more laid back, and not quite so one-dimensionally, utterly heartless, selfish and evil. If he had shown us a little more about what made him tick, and what changed him from being a decent, hard-working married man, into this horrific, drug-addled, sex- monster, I truly believe it would have been a far more enjoyable and satisfying two hours of entertainment. But clearly the scriptwriters and director didn't want to go that way and it is a shame, as it could have been a much better movie if they had.The very first two IMDb reviews say: Soul-Sucking Mind-Poison 'DON'T PAY TO SEE THIS MOVIE!' 'Con Man cons Scorsese & DiCaprio' They go on and on, one after the other. I'm glad I'm not alone, as the professional reviewers are still raving about it. Raving mad - more like.",5,4,6,11 April 2016
The Big Short," An excellent, entertaining movie.
","If this film hadn't been multi-Oscar-nominated and also hadn't been so well regarded by the critics, I doubt whether I would have bothered to watch it.This is notwithstanding the fact that it stars one of my favourite actors, Steve Carrel. After all, do I really want to hear yet again about how the world went into recession and resulted in me to losing hundreds of thousands of dollars? Quite frankly, it is an event I'd rather forget.But I'm glad I did see it.Not only did it add to my understanding of the whole sorry saga, but it was surprisingly entertaining – full of dark humour.The Big Short is essentially the true story about a few clever people who actually foresaw the crash coming and bet everything they could get hold of on that certainty. We, the audience are given an easy to follow lesson on what caused the recession and just how corrupt and deceitful the whole crazy US financial system turned out to be.It is also a cliff-hanger, in as much as these disparate entrepreneurs who gambled their lives on the system crashing, were nearly derailed by the utter corruption of the financial establishment. Even when it was commonly known throughout the markets that the sub-prime bonds were worthless, none of the major banks would admit to it. Even worse, (if that's possible) the disgusting rating agencies colluded with the establishment and continued to rate these worthless bonds as triple 'A' bonds. Yet they freely admitted they knew the truth but were worried about losing their rating business.We can't help but applaud these clever folk who foretold the market crash and succeeded in becoming multi-millionaires. We also deplore the fact that nothing much seems to have changed, and not one of the principal criminals has spent a single night in jail.It is an excellent, entertaining movie and definitely worth a viewing, but I'm not totally convinced it was worthy of nomination for the best film Oscar.",8,1,1,29 March 2016
The Deer Hunter," The Deer Hunter has stood the test of time and I am sure it will still be eminently watchable in another 30 years.
","The other day I dipped into the past and had a second viewing of Michael Cimino's Deer Hunter. It is a 3-hour epic about three blue- collar Pennsylvania workers who enlist to fight in Vietnam and about their friends, wives, and lovers that they leave back home. The film, which was made in 1979, was the only really successful movie in Cimino's brief directorial career and some maintain that the sheer effort of getting this masterpiece to the screen was so draining on his creative juices that he was subsequently washed out as a director for ever more.I have no idea if there is any substance to this, but, watching this film, after a break of some 30 odd years, I still find it an extraordinary piece of filmmaking, and it must surely be in anyone's top ten of all-time greatest movies. Apart from arguably, the overlong wedding scene, (about 51 minutes!), the film just flies by. The film is not really about the Vietnam War. It is about a group of men whose lives are changed forever by the horrors of war – it could have been any war – and more of the action actually takes place in America than in the 'war zones'.As with any great movie, the cast is superb, without a single weak link. Leading the pack are Robert De Niro, Meryl Streep, Christopher Walken and John Savage – a virtual who's who of Hollywood's greatest and they certainly pulled out all the stops here. Deer Hunter is a very moving, very scary, electrifying, extremely thought-provoking film. It explores the conflicting reactions of regular, working-class Americans, when they are transplanted into a totally alien, hostile, tropical climate - to a country where life means nothing and where the American psyche suffered a bloody nose. The Vietnam sequences were actually shot in Thailand and I happened to have been there at the time and knew many locals who were involved in the production. I also recognised many of the 'bit-players' and the nightclub sequences that were shot in the Patpong red-light district of Bangkok.So it was really turning back of the clock when I watched this movie the other day. On the first occasion, I watched it in a cinema in Bangkok, which was packed to overflowing due to the publicity it had received as it was partly shot in Thailand. The film actually flopped at the box office in Thailand as the Thais just didn't get it and I am sure many walked out before the conclusion of the notorious 51-minute wedding scene.But there is no doubt in this reviewer's mind that The Deer Hunter has stood the test of time and I am sure it will still be eminently watchable in another 30 years. Movie lovers out there who have not seen The Deer Hunter would do well to seek it out and see how an old-fashioned piece of American filmmaking can still move you and inspire you.Happy movie watching, folks",10,1,2,6 May 2016
Heat," The definitive 'Cops & Robbers' movie - bar none!
","A few days ago I finally got around to watching the much regarded 1995 'cops and robbers' movie, 'Heat.' I'm not a particular fan of this genre unless it is really well done, but Heat has been on my list of 'Movies to watch' for quite a while. It received high praise from most critics and seemed to have some excellent credentialsLet's face it, a movie starring Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, (two of my all-time favourite actors), along with John Voight, Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, Ashley Judd, Natalie Portman and many, many more, could hardly fail. And it didn't – even more so as it was in the hands of one of the masters of the genre, Michael Mann, who wrote and directed it.The film is a whopping 2 hours 46 minutes, but the time just flew by, leaving me begging for more. Heat is undoubtedly one the definitive films of any era and although it was made twenty years ago, it hasn't dated at all and is still eminently watchable. Okay, the cell phones may have been a little on the large side, but that aside, this movie could have been made last year.Al Pacino as the hard-bitten cop on a mission and whose personal life is falling apart, and Robert De Niro – the tough, no-nonsense criminal genius – both play their parts to perfection. These two towering figures of the silver screen are only seen together in two scenes.The first meeting is about half way through the movie, when they enjoy a cup of coffee together. This is a classic confrontation between 'good and evil'; with both of them acknowledging the unstoppable forces that drive them to do what they do. They even have a grudging respect for each other – given the different paths they have chosen in life.The second time they meet is at the end of the movie when we watch the denouement of these two mesmerizing characters played out to the bitter end.Pacino and De Niro are totally 'on song' in this film and Mann has written their parts in a way that allows them to excel in what they do best. The supporting cast, with the likes of Kilmer and Voight (both villains), are a joy to behold and the movie is acted by an ensemble of actors that was taken from the best that Hollywood had to offer in the mid - 90's.Of course, with Mann directing, there is plenty of violence, and a seemingly never-ending shoot-out scene ranks right up there with some of the greatest shoot-outs of all time. To say any more about Heat would spoil the movie for those who haven't yet seen it.Even if you have, it is well worth another looksie after all these years. Go get the DVD or download it. You will NOT be disappointed.",10,10,16,31 March 2016
Inside Llewyn Davis," The story is quite trivial and uninspiring, with little humour.
","Inside Llewyn Davis tells the tale of a moderately gifted singer/songwriter, back in the early 60's when the likes of Bob Dylan was on his way up. Davis tries, unsuccessfully, to make a name for himself in the pop music business.It is a nice little movie, extremely well made by the much loved and highly rated Cohen brothers, but ultimately, the story is quite trivial, uninspiring and not deserving of an Oscar, despite the general clamour than it should have been nominated.Llewyn Davis, the lead character, is not a very appealing or likable person and the film really doesn't go anywhere. All it is succeeds in doing is spreading a little more doom and gloom into our anxt - filled lives. It is supposed to have some humour, but apart from one or two isolated incidents, to me it was unremittingly grim.I am only mentioning this film because of claims from many in the industry that it should have been nominated for Best Picture. Trust me, they are wrong. It didn't deserve to have been nominated – any more than 'Her' deserved to be nominated.",6,0,1,13 April 2016
Her," Why not wait till it appears in your TV schedules?
","This is quite a nice little movie, and I enjoyed a pleasant 126 minutes watching it, but quite frankly I can see just as good – and often better – on television almost every week, and I really fail to understand why such a movie should be elevated to the point where it was nominated for best film. I think the answer is that it was directed by Spike Jonze, and everyone knows that a Spike Jonze movie must be good. Just like a Woody Allen film, until he fell out of – and is now back in – favour.As soon as I started watching this film it immediately put me in mind of a really clever little TV drama I saw last year on Channel 4, entitled 'Be Right Back' from the 'Black Mirror' series, written by Charlie Brooker. While the plots are a bit different, it is the same basic idea, and quite honestly, I much preferred the Charlie Brooker drama. 'Her', (the movie), is about a lonely geek, (Joaquin Phoenix), who is in the final stages of divorce, and spends his spare time playing video games. He purchases a new system for his computer and his smart phone, which is advertised as the world's first artificially intelligent operating system. He is 'introduced' to Samantha, the voice of the system, which comes in the guise of a sexy female voice. (Scarlett Johansson).He finds himself drawn to Samantha as he spends more and more time talking to her and eventually he falls in love with her. 'Samantha' uses her powerful artificial intelligence to help him and stimulate him in ways real women have been unable to do. He even has some kind of cyber-sex with her, but we are spared the dubious pleasure of being a voyeur to this, although we do hear it taking place. It is a strange tale which is entertaining enough, without pulling at the heartstrings or really offering anything in the way of some kind of spiritual fulfilment that we might expect from an Oscar nominated movie.I know that the professional critics absolutely adore Joaquin Phoenix, but I find him an odd fish who is somehow devoid of emotion and as such, he leaves me cold. He had rave reviews for his performance in the 'The Master' which I found one of the most boring, over-long and overrated films of 2013. So for me he does an adequate job in the lead role, but evokes no feelings of sympathy, empathy or even dislike from this reviewer. Maybe that is the idea, but if it is, then I fail to see the point. Surely viewers need to get involved and emoted with a movie they are watching?Contrast 'Her' within the afore-stated, low budget TV movie, 'Be Right Back'. In 'Be Right Back', the lead role is a woman, and we see her briefly living happily together with her husband before she loses him in a car accident. We immediately relate to the pain she is going through and unlike 'Her', the cyber internet friend in this story is her dead husband. He is recreated by some kind of 'grief assuaging outfit' from all his myriad social profiles, text message history, emails, Facebook postings and goodness knows what else. His voice is recreated from his real voice, recorded from web cam conversations and phone calls. It is a very clever piece of mayhem, and almost credible. Unlike in 'Her', the cyber recreation of the lost husband eventually manifests itself in 'physical form' when a package is delivered, which becomes a life-like robot who is the spitting image of her dear departed beloved.Ultimately, the end result for both tales is a re-awakening of faith and hope in real humanity - rather than in some artificial creation. If you have not seen either story, which one appeals to you the most? Her, the Oscar nominated movie, reinforces my view that it is completely unnecessary to spend countless millions of dollars on films that can be made for a fraction of the price if you cut out the exorbitant fees paid to over-priced stars. At a rumoured 20 million dollars, 'Her' was a cheap movie by Hollywood standards, but still dwarfed more than ten-fold the cost of putting 'Be right Back' on our TV screens.'Be Right Back' was, in my humble opinion, a better-crafted movie, evoking much more empathy with the leading players and with a better, more cynical and satirical message to impart. And as if 'Her' wasn't trivial enough, we didn't even get a single glimpse of the absolutely gorgeous Scarlett Johansson, who in my view is one of the loveliest of Hollywood lovelies. (Couldn't they have had a 'dream sequence' in which Joaquin imagined what his Samantha might look like – preferably in bed? No, I suppose notScarlett might have doubled her fee)What did the reviewers say?Of course, the professional critics are ecstatic about it. I mean Spike Jonze! Joaquin Phoenix! they probably wrote their glowing reviews before they had even seen it..And what about the punters from IMDb?'Just about the best thing you can see in 2013' 'I love everything about Her' 'In a word, brilliant!' 'HER – a visually beautiful ode the technological age.'They go on and on. Not that I necessarily disagree with them, but I do feel that their praise is a bit OTT.Ah at long last, here's one,'Immensely disappointing!'No, that's not quite right either. But why not wait till it appears on your TV schedules? It really isn't worth the effort of going down- town to your cinema to see it or even buy the DVD. And it certainly didn't deserve an Oscar nomination.",6,0,0,14 April 2016
Hacksaw Ridge," You will be 'shocked and awed' and come out feeling a little better than when you went in.
","I'll get this review in just ahead of the Oscar awards, as it deserves my support – not that it will make one iota of difference. Of all the films I have seen recently which are nominated for best picture, in my humble opinion, only 'Hacksaw Ridge' and 'Manchester by the Sea' are worthy contenders. 'Hell or High Water' is a good movie but not deserving of Best Picture. 'Arrival' starts OK-ish but deteriorates into rubbish. La La Land is rubbish throughout. I gave up on 'Fences', for while it is a worthy subject and brilliantly acted, it's a stage play – not a movie. 'Moonlight' is good but is not the finished article, and I haven't seen 'Lion' or 'Hidden Figures', so I can't comment.Back to 'Hacksaw Ridge', which is beautifully directed by Mel Gibson. Gibson has been through purgatory, quite rightly, for his rabid anti-Semitic comments and other sociopathic meltdowns. But the academy has judged him on his artistic achievements and put his misdeeds to one side - which is how it should be.I wonder if they would have been quite so understanding if Mr. Gibson had declared himself a Trump supporter? In the eyes of Hollywood, you can be a racist, and a wife abuser, but not a Republican. I digress.I doubt that Hacksaw Ridge is the war movie most of us expected to see when we sit down to watch it. As a genre, I am not keen on war movies, although there have been some pretty good ones, such as 'Platoon', 'Saving private Ryan' and 'Good Morning Vietnam.' To these, I would definitely add Hacksaw Ridge. It is the true story of Desmond Doss, a deeply religious man who decides to enlist in WW2 because he wants to be a medic and save lives.We first meet the adult Desmond at his home in Virginia where he saves the life of a man in a road accident which leads him to meet his future wife at the local hospital.After signing up, his troubles start when he has to go through basic training and he refuses to carry a gun. He is court-martialed and is at the point of being sentenced to years in a military jail when he is granted a last minute reprieve and is allowed to continue his training and go to the war front - without a gun.The action switches to Hacksaw Ridge, the taking of which will presage the collapse of Okinawa and the ending of the war against the Japanese.At first derided by his fellow soldiers due to his refusal to bear arms, Desmond is thrust into the front lines of a murderous battle, where many of his comrades are killed or mortally wounded.The US army is obliged to retreat from the ridge, leaving their wounded behind for the Japanese to kill and mutilate at their leisure.But they hadn't reckoned on Desmond Doss, who returns to the battlefield time and time again, and under the noses of the Japanese, he succeeds in single-handedly rescuing 75 casualties from certain death. In later skirmishes on the ridge, he performs more unbelievably heroic rescues, before becoming seriously wounded after he kicks a grenade away to save his comrades from the explosion.There is much more to this story, and you don' have to be a lover of war movies to appreciate this deeply moving tale. It is actually an anti-war movie because it shows you what war is really all about, stripped of romantic and heroic notions. It shows up close the manner in which war wreaks terrible consequences on the participants – of both sides.To say that Andrew Garfield is utterly brilliant in the role of Desmond Doss is an understatement, and nobody was more surprised than me to discover he was an Englishman, so convincing is his accent. There are no bad actors in this movie – From Teresa Palmer, who plays the nurse who becomes Doss's wife, to all the myriad actors who played the members of his family and his comrades (and enemies) in the military.Gibson has used all his consummate skill and vast experience to show us the horrors of war and what true heroism is all about. We applaud this gallant soldier who was the first man to receive the Medal of Honor – America's highest award for bravery - without ever firing a shot. We could do with few more like Desmond Doss today. What a wonderful example of simple humanity in these times of unspeakable violence, hedonism and such manic selfishness and self-love that is slowly destroying our cherished beliefs and even civilization itself.Oscar for Best Actor? It really is impossible to choose between Andrew Garfield and Casey Affleck for the best actor award, (although Affleck will get it), and as far as the Best Picture is concerned, I think maybe 'Hacksaw' just has the edge over 'Manchester', but I'm sure that the rubbishy 'La La Land' will get it.Go see Hacksaw Ridge – you will be 'shocked and awed' and come out feeling a little better than when you went in.",10,4,8,24 February 2017
The Great Gatsby," This is a fine movie; but whether it will be regarded as the definitive Gatsby film remains to be seen.
","I had been waiting with bated breath for many months for the cinematic release of the latest attempt to put the 'great American novel' on the silver screen. This time, strangely, it was an Aussie who was handed the poisoned chalice by the Hollywood moguls. There were several reasons for my eager anticipation. Firstly, I am a great admirer of F. Scott Fitzgerald, and while I personally prefer his inspirational 'Tender is the Night', (which amongst other things, relates the rise and inevitable fall of an alcoholic), I do nevertheless hold 'the Great Gatsby' in very high regard. Fitzgerald was so naturally talented and was such a beautiful writer of the English language that frankly everything that he has ever written is just fine by me.I can see why Gatsby is considered as one of the finest American novels. Apart from it being beautifully written, it also tells the story of the 'American Dream' – in a country where you can totally reinvent yourself and become unbelievably rich and successful. Although there is much dark stuff in Gatsby, it is nowhere near as dark as 'Tender is the Night' and maybe Americans prefer to exalt 'Gatsby', which they have clearly taken to their hearts rather than the complex and troublesome 'autobiographical Tender is The Night.Secondly, I saw the 1974 version of Gatsby, shortly after reading the novel, and while it was okay-ish, on the whole I found it somewhat disappointing. Considering the great cast, headed up by Robert Redford and Mia Farrow, I felt that they could have made a better fist of it.Thirdly, I have long been a fan of Australian film director, Baz Luhrmann. In particular I loved 'Strictly Ballroom' and the magical 'Moulin Rouge' although I was quite disappointed with 'Australia', (especially Nicole Kidman's ridiculous upper class English accent – almost as bad as Dick Van Dyke's much derided cockney accent). So after the somewhat muted reception of 'Australia' I wondered whether he could rediscover his directorial touch with Gatsby.Did He? To be honest I'm still not 100% sure. It certainly divided the critics; it seems they either loved it or hated it. I'm not in either camp. I enjoyed watching the film and never got bored despite its 2 hours 20 minutes length. Much of it was great stuff and it was certainly a huge improvement on the 1974 version, but somehow the movie stopped short of being really great. The actors, with the possible exception of Toby Maguire were brilliant – particularly Leonardo as Jay Gatsby and Joel Edgerton as Tom Buchanan– and there is no doubt that the movie told the story quite faithfully and used much of Fitzgerald's original dialogue.The grossly over-the-top scenes of the parties at Gatsby's mansion and the scenes of drunken, drug-taking debauchery in downtown New York were fascinating and highly entertaining to watch. But I suppose I fall into the camp that feels that with such a great novel, the director owed some kind of duty to an American classic and should not have taken us into such surrealistic flights of fancy.I believe the movie would have been truly great if these scenes of decadence had been portrayed in a more realistic manner; maybe with a gritty, 1930's feel to them. After all, surely they were wild enough as originally written without having to undergo the 'Luhrmann treatment'. It was almost as though 'Moulin Rouge' met 'Moulin Gatsby'. These scenes are great fun – a feast of voyeurism – but somewhat out of place, and frankly, unnecessary. I also feel that the scenes at the motor garage were rushed and could have been longer and better developed, as they are so integral to the story; but maybe I am being picky.The device of Nick, (Toby Maguire), telling the whole story from a sanatorium was contrived by Lurhmann and in my opinion, was rather pointless. Maybe the Lurrhmann-invented scenes at the sanatorium should have been sacrificed and replaced with extended scenes in the 'valley of Ashes'. I am sure it is all there in the rushes. A Director's cut, maybe? While I still believe that 3D is largely a gimmick which will probably disappear from main-stream movies, the use of 3D in Gatsby probably enhanced my enjoyment, and I have no complaints on that front.Don't get me wrong – this is a fine movie; but whether it will go down as the definitive Gatsby film remains to be seen. If you have a chance, I recommend that you it. There's not too much on at the cinemas these days that are worth the effort of getting up from your sofa, but Baz Lurhrmann's Great Gatsby is certainly one of them.",8,0,1,17 April 2016
