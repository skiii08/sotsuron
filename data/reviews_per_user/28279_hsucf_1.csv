Requiem for a Dream," Thanks but no thanks.
","This is painful to watch. But that's not the reason why I hated it. In very simple terms, I don't need a movie to tell me how fxxked my life is going to be if I do drugs (which I guess is the message of the movie). If you are stupid enough to do drugs, you deserve the consequences. Evolution rules.Viewers seem to have been swayed by this movie's shock value. Not me. The plot is thin. In one sentence, it is 'Some idiots, whose existence is a liability to society, let their drug addictions spiral out of their control.' WTF? I'd rather watch turtles fxxk. This movie doesn't deserve to be in the top 250. 646 of the top 100 voters gave it an average of 6.6. Goes a lot to say how overrated it is.",1,5,12,9 June 2007
