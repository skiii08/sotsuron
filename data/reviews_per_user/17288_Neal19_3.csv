The Ring," Better than most movies in the genre
","I don't plan on spoiling this for anyone, so please read on.  This movie was a thriller to the core.  It did exactly what it was intended to do, scare the audience.  It will freak out the audience if the atmosphere is right, and believe me it was when I watched it.  Some guys will try and be tough guys and say the movie sucked, but that is simply not the case.  The Ring is a truly unique scary movie that deserves to be watched with an open mind. There is a part when you think the movie is over, don't leave just yet. About 6 people got up and left out of the audience I watched it with.  They sure did miss out.  At the end of the movie you will truly understand why the movie is titled The Ring.  The movie is indeed, a ring.  Like most scary movies not everything added up, but I won't get into that.  Great movie of the genre.",10,0,0,30 October 2002
The Matrix Revolutions," I think Everyone is Missing the Point
","I could be wrong, but I think everyone is missing the main point of the movie.  On the surface it is about man's struggle against artificial intelligence; man being oppressed by its own genius.  Underneath I think it is about man's purpose.  Every speech that the antagonist Smith gave was about his failure to understand what drives man. Every computer program has a purpose, a meaning.  Does every man have a meaning? Why do we get up in the morning; what drives us to live.  Why do we get scared when our lives are threatened?  What makes us protective of life?  Is it Love?  Neo had one love, Trinity.  Trinity was killed.  What drove Neo after that?  After Smith had given Neo an old fashioned butt whuping, after it was obvious he couldn't beat Smith, After his only love Trinity had been killed, Neo persists.  Smith can't understand it.  'Why Mr. Anderson, Why, Why do you persist?  Ask yourself, why would you persist.  That is the question this movie is trying to provoke.  The movie was about man's (Neo) struggle (Agent Smith) with finding the purpose of life.  After seeing the climatic battle sequence, I would say the Wachowski's think that man's struggle with the meaning of life is quite epic.  I think people who didn't like the movie missed the point because they were distracted by all the special effects.",10,0,0,7 November 2003
The Matrix Revolutions," Great Ending to a Great Trilogy
","What a terrific and enjoyable trilogy the Matrix as been.  I am sad that it is over. Revolutions was a great ending.  Every loose end was tied up.  Some people have told me that they were confused after Reloaded.  This should answer any questions they may have.  If it doesn't answer your questions then you might need ritalin because you have no attention span.  Sci-Fi is not for everyone, so I understand if some people did not enjoy these films, but I personally did.  The movie was about two sides of a war.  The dominant sides weapons grew beyond their own control and so the machines reluctantly required help from their enemy.  Because Neo helped the enemy peace was had by all. The thing I love most is the Matrix's style.  The clothes, color scheme, choreography, music, and lighting were simply terrific.  I could really tell that the Wachowski's were highly influenced by comics.  An understanding of the art of comics might help you enjoy the film as much as I did.  In my opinion, there is nothing negative to say about the trilogy.  It might have been more liked if there was more fighting and less dialogue; some people are mindless idiots.",10,0,0,4 November 2003
