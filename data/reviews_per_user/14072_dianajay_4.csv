United 93," Constant Shaking of Camera Made us Feel Motion Sick!!!!
","The movie may have been good in the story line... however the camera was shaking so darn much, as if they were trying to make us feel like we were there, that we were getting motion sick and dizzy just watching the darn thing... I would have liked to see the entire movie, but felt awful trying to watch the shaky thing and decided to leave about half way through. My husband felt the same way and was more than happy to leave. We really did want to see it, but the constant jolting of the camera all over the place and the lack of focus through the lens made us so sick that we just couldn't handle it. I'm not sure how so many people gave it such a high rating. It was so poorly shot and edited that I can't recommend it!!! I did see a similar made for TV move that I did enjoy and did justice to that day and what those pasengers did. If you get motion sick ever, even in the slightest, don't see this movie!",4,14,36,24 May 2006
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Spectacular Story and Incredible Scenery!!!
","This was an excellent movie! I was amazed that Disney did such a great job adapting the book into a feature film. The cinematography was incredible. This is a must see on a Big Screen, as the big screen allows you to see all of the amazing scenery and it's beauty up close. The casting for this film was absolutely perfect. The four children, being basically unknowns in the business, did a perfect job portraying each of the characters. Each of them is likely headed into wonderful acting careers. When I went to see the film, I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was very pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed the entire experience. I was familiar with the book, but wasn't sure how well it would adapt to the screen. I was more than impressed with it and feel that there is something in this for everyone! Christian or not, this movie can be enjoyed by all and has a wonderful heartfelt message. I highly recommend it and look forward to it coming out on DVD so we can add it to our movie collection. It is sure to be a classic.",10,0,0,30 December 2005
Cars," Best Animated Movie I have ever seen!!!
","I went to this moving thinking okay... it's just going to be another silly cartoon. I found this movie to be the best animated movie I have ever seen. It was well written, was good clean fun, exciting at times and even had some romantic scenes... This movie has something for everyone... including good morals. At times we got so into the story that we forgot we were watching a cartoon with cars as the characters. The cars actually began to seem like real people with real feelings and emotions. The facial expressions were amazing. My husband and I both definitely recommend this to everyone... young and old! We will definitely purchase this when it comes out on DVD!",10,1,2,18 June 2006
World Trade Center," Very Well Done Movie!!! With No Political Agenda...
","We weren't sure whether or not we would want to see this movie. Oliver Stone is someone who's movies we don't usually agree with. After reading many of the reviews on this site, we decided to give this movie a chance.It is a very impressive, well executed movie... with excellent acting, directing and editing!!! It is a movie that will remind you of that day, however, it is a movie about heroes, friendships and triumphs. Yes, there are points in the movie that you will tear up and even cry, yet there is also laughter at some points and there is a lot of positive throughout the movie even though it is was a time of crisis and horror surrounding the situation. The horror of that day does exist in the movie, however it isn't overplayed or too dramatic to watch.... Also, that is not the main part of the movie. The movie is based on the lives to two of the trapped survivors as they tell/recall what happened to them on that day.The audience sat in awe watching the movie... nobody ever got up to leave their seats... and everyone was amazed at the end of how well the story was told. I've never seen the Theatre so crowded on a weeknight (almost at capacity)... and it was being shown on multiple screens at a big theater.I do recommend all American's see this movie... as it pays tribute to the heroes and shows some of the good that came from the tragedy.",8,145,278,11 August 2006
