Hereditary," I forgot I've watched this before
",I rarely write reviews for films on here with the exception for... Well I don't really know whenever I remember to actually write a thing.But this is... a special case.So I've started watching this today... the 26th of August 2019... and after like 30 minutes in the characters seem... familiar. Wait... there's a party... and the thing... with the thing... I'm obviously not going to spoil it but.It took me around 30 minutes of boredom to figure out that I'VE ALREADY WATCHED THIS.It's so bad it took me half an hour to remember it.,1,0,5,25 August 2019
Us," Am I watching the same movie as those who voted 1/10?
","...another proof that a horror movie does not rely on jumpscares will be less consumed by the media than actual horror.Chances are you probably just... read the first review that comes on the website and the watch the movie. Let's not kid ourselves, I do that too and I've never been disappointed by the results.However.Come on.Just lick on 'sell all reviews' and read what some of these people are saying.They're saying the plot is boring? Mediocre? That it doesn't have sense?...we're getting more and more stupid as time passes and apparently the moment we find something that's weird we have to google it, and because it's not spoon-fed to us it means it's mediocre.I think someone or something is organized to give this bad reviews because... this is a must watch, it's the best horror movie that came out since The Witch.",10,3,10,8 October 2019
