Deja Vu," Deja Vu is NOT to be missed
","As most great movies, Deja Vu may be enjoyed on many levels. Many will just enjoy the pure fast-moving entertainment value of the movie - Denzel Washington puts in another stellar performance, and is supported by an excellent cast. About the only thing negative I'd have to say is the lack of depth in the other characters... but that's simply necessary in a 2 hour movie with so much to tell.Many (especially us guys!) will enjoy the sci-fi aspects of the movie... and leave the gadgetry at that. Which is a shame. Because there's so much more that is being intimated here.Of course, there are the romantic aspects that Hollywood must have... and the predictable ending.But the part that excited me most, and I hope gets some others thinking, is what makes this a GREAT movie rather than just another predictable Hollywood moneymaker.And that is those elements that get us thinking... maybe there's really more than just what's in front of our eyes in this experience we call being 'human'? The movie does a really good job at opening up a line of questioning that leading Scientists have been approaching over just the last couple decades... and that many folks exploring 'off-the-beaten-path' forms of spiritual thinking are doing in greater and greater numbers today.Witness the surprisingly massive audience for best-sellers like Neale Donald Walsh's 'Conversations with God' series, and more recently Gary Renard's 'Disappearance of the Universe' and 'Your Immortal Reality' book series.As these authors and some leading Scientists explain, there may be more to heaven and earth than meets the eye! These authors confirm Deja Vu's premise that parallel threads of 'reality' are not only possible, but happening as we speak, simultaneously with the only existence we seem to be conscious of in this moment.And as explained in the great spiritual text we would all do well to read, 'A Course In Miracles', the 'reality' we seem to be experiencing here is but another dream, and we are the dream makers... so we get to make it up in new and different ways as much as we want. Our job here is to awaken from the dream, and become aware again of who we really are (spiritual beings have a brief, human experience) and where we really are (with God, and all God's sons and daughters).And if that's a bit too far out for you, then just enjoy the movie at whatever level you choose... it's all good!",10,17,35,22 November 2006
