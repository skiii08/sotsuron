The Avengers," Awesome
","This is the movie of the year. It has a really good plot,and the heroes are really awesome... Iron Man is cool as he always is. Thor was surprising me with his fight with Iron man. Captain America is the most brave one and leader, but he was kind of lame... The Green Giant was a beast!!! One of the awesome moments in the movie is when the green giant hits Loki so bad! Another one is when in the end of the movie Iron Man Flies to the space, throw the bomb and then 'surprisely' make it to Earth. Worth the money of the ticket and even more. I recommend you all to go and see this movie. Definitely one of the best movies of my life.",10,5,11,12 May 2012
