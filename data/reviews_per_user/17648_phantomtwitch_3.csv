Gremlins," Give it some credit , A 6.6 ? come on !!!
","This is supposed to be a kid's flick ? I didn't and still don't think so . This was a great movie that was fun for all ages and shouldn't be labeled a kiddie flick . They die in blenders , microwaves ,etc...They drink beer , and flash people... These guys are classic !!!",9,0,1,14 April 2000
American Psycho," Crafty , Crafty
",I enjoyed this flick to the fullest . It isn't as controversial as one might imagine .The violence isn't on screen most of the time and it pretty much is a satire . Anyone who enjoys a good black comedy will love this . It is a guilty pleasure . It will be better on video or DVD I'm sure . You can enjoy it with a case of beer at home .,10,0,0,14 April 2000
Halloween," The film that started the trend
","I saw this film when I was 15 and have watched it many times since . It has been copied so many times and is definitely the most important horror film next to 'Psycho' . Without a movie like this we wouldn't have had Freddy , Jason , or William Shatner . Try to get the DVD Special Edition that has the Tv version and the theatrical version . The Tv version has clips that include Dr. Loomis inside the hospital where Myers lives and alternate killing scenes (not as violent ) . A must for anyone who loves horror .",9,0,0,14 April 2000
