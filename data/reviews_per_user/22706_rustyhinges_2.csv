Requiem for a Dream," Shocking, Literally Leaves You Breathless
","Okay, just to get this out of the way: DO NOT BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE RATING. This movie is very, very potent, but teens should be encouraged to see it, much less banned from it. This film is probably one of the most emotionally charged pictures I have ever seen. Ellen Burstyn brings her character to life on her terrifying fall into addiction. She deserved the Oscar, but unfortunately was screwed over by the academy.  This is a terrific movie. Rent it, buy it, see it now. Don't bother reading this SEE THIS MOVIE!",10,0,0,25 May 2001
American History X," A Brutal, Stunning, and Poignant Film
","When I first heard of AMERICAN HISTORY X I figured it was just another 'hate is bad, love each other' movies, but now I know that it is so much more. It ranks among the most powerful movies I have ever seen. It has a way of haunting you long after you leave the theatre. To this day when I hear of hate crimes on the news I shudder and think of the scene where Edward Norton commits a brutal murder and a chill still runs up my back. Edward Norton was absolutely amazing in this movie. He managed to convey why his character was the way he was, without giving a bias to the audience. This alone is a difficult task, but then, after his reform, he allows the audience to sympathise with him, even though he was once a horrible monster. At the beginning, we are allowed to see Derek's confused views and some may even start to see their side, but slowly their side takes on a hideous insanity and we see the true evil that is hate. This movie is very brutal and violent, but it is a film that should be seen. It will change the way you look at hate and stay with you forever.",Null,0,0,25 November 2000
