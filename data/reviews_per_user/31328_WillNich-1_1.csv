Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Absolutely hilarious
","This is the most outlandish, original, over-the-top movie since 'Pink Flamingos.' Cohen is a comic genius, a worthy successor to Peter Sellers and Robin Williams. Where do you begin to describe this outrageously hilarious film? Nearly every scene is a laugh riot, a must-see! As for the controversies about the main character's prejudices, this movie is actually a brilliant expose of all kinds of prejudices. And as far as him making fun of Kazhakstan, the comedy is so broad and the jokes so unbelievable that you really have to lack a sense of humor not to realize how idiotic those jokes are. Not to give anything away, but my top favorite scenes were the wrestling scene in the hotel room, and the Pamela Anderson scene at the end, but there were so many funny moments, it's hard to stop laughing just thinking about them hours after I saw the film. Bravo!",10,2,16,5 November 2006
