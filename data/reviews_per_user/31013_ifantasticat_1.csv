It," Not as bad as they say
","I was a bit antsy when I went into the theater on opening night, I was so excited when I first watched, I was mad that it wasn't what I had hoped it'd been. My main problem was that the cgi was not good, but going back and rewatching It, it wasn't that bad. I also didn't like the look of Pennywise. In the book, he was supposed to look like an actual clown, to lure children into the sewers, not look like a demon. Now this movie is based later than in the book and miniseries, and post John Wayne Gacy. So I guess clowns wouldn't really lure anyone anywhere, so they went with the very scary, demon vibe. The plot, the losers, and It, are very accurate to the book (excluding the Pennywise form, and the mythology backstory). So... it's not a perfect film, but yeah, I'd recommend 'It' (2017) it's not spot on, tit for tat like the book, but I understand the changes and reasoning.",8,1,2,5 June 2018
