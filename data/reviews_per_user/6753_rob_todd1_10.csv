BlacKkKlansman," Could have been good...
",But ended up being an anti trump statement. Seems the whole of the privileged elite in Hollywood are Marxists determined to subvert the will of the people.Shame as it could have been a good movie!,1,51,116,10 September 2018
It Follows," Passable
","I feel for horror film makers. It must be really difficult to make something different and original, though ultimately that is down to the amount of material being produced by horror writers. It Follows follows a pretty typical formula of a curse that needs to be passed on for the cursed to free themselves from the consequences. Having sex with the next victim is a twist but doesn't really add enough to make the film original or thrilling enough to warrant more than an average film. That said, some of the delivery is good. Even if the material is familiar we all like to be scared and the score and the tension does build effectively in some key scenes. So whilst no horror classic, It Follows does tick some boxes and is worth a viewing by any horror aficionado. Though I expect infrequent horror goers may come away a little more satisfied.",6,5,24,1 March 2015
Midsommar," Terrible
",Quite possibly the most boring film I have watched in a long time.You know it's bad when the audience start laughing at a 'serious' scene.Over hyped like most boring movies. Watch something else. Anything!,1,414,723,11 July 2019
Zero Dark Thirty," Appalling film
","I wondered if after 1 and 1/2 hours when I wanted to get up and leave if I was missing the point. A film with such critical acclaim. I really wished i had walked out and reclaimed an hour of my life! Annoying/poor acting, boring plot. Tacit support of torture. One sided. Propaganda which backfires to anyone with a brain. Do yourself a favour and give it a wide birth. There are a number of reviews on IMDb which are far more articulate than mine in describing how poor this file is from its inaccuracies in context and history, it's acceptance of torture, poor acting and dreadful pace. It's at least an hour too long. There was a documentary shown in the uk which pointed out that the entire operation at the end was a joke. A helicopter tried to land in an enclosed space - when well known this would cause an accident. Trying to breach a door that was bricked up. The movie should have pointed out that the us spent over 10 years tracking down the most wanted man in the world only to be 50% sure it was him, and starting an operation with pathetic intelligence after studying a compound for over 100 days! Clearly propaganda supporting the amazing operation - which came close to disaster and which would have been much more interesting to point out",1,15,32,30 March 2013
Marriage Story," Depressing
",One of those films that leaves you realising how pathetic people can be. And it's not a good film or well acted if you see past that. Glad I saw it on someone else's Netflix and didn't waste money at cinema or on a subscription,1,8,23,24 December 2019
