Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Stop the complaining and start enjoying
","I thought this movie was a fine example of originality and movie making. This movie is appealing to all fans both young and old, not because it has cameos by people we already know, but because it introduces us to people and places we don't.I've read some pretty harsh things about character development, great script writing and annoying characters...-- If you want long drawn out character development read the volumes of Star Wars books (or the Eye of the World series)...-- If you want great script writing rent the Shawshank Redemption...-- Jar Jar Binks is hardly as annoying as your in-laws...If you want a movie that excites you and has you asking -- who, what, why and when -- than this is your movie (If it developed and told you everything why would you go to the next 2 movies)?",8,0,0,19 May 1999
