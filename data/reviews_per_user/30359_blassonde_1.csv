3:10 to Yuma," Well done.
","A very well done remake of a fine film. Russell Crowe is fantastic, as is Ben Foster. I think Ben is a very under-rated actor. Mr. Crowe delivers a great performance, skipping back and forth between the charming gentleman and the heartless gunfighter. Christian Bale is ok, but I found his constant intensity distracting. The scenery is great, as is the cinematography, soundtrack and direction. Kudos to Mr. Mangold.",8,0,0,24 April 2018
