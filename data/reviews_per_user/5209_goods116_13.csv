Insidious: Chapter 2," Awful what a waste of time
","The first movie was decent and had some interesting sequences. This one was just a pile of garbage that just recycled every possible ghost horror movie cliché that ever existed. Large house that is poorly lit? check (for god's sake, if you think you are seeing ghosts wouldn't you turn on ALL the lights in your house and even get extras?) Ghostly images in photos and mirrors? check. Children's toys inexplicably moving? check. Doors slamming on their own? check (seriously is this still being used?). Babies in danger? check (for god's sake if you thought your baby was in danger from ghosts wouldn't you keep the baby in the same room as you at ALL times?) Ghost walking through you house and when you try to catch up it just turns the corner a second ahead of you and then is gone? check. Ghost sitting with back turned to you? check. Ghost hiding in closet or behind wall jumping out when you go to investigate? check. AND so many more. Pile of garbage.",4,8,13,5 November 2014
John Wick," Monotonous and tedious, this movie is way overrated
","This movie was watchable, but seriously an 8? Again, I find these ratings are given out of context, meaning that it's not being compared to other movies. The plot is basically a hit man is wronged and kills everyone in the mob gang who wronged him. That's basically it. How many times can we watch Keanu Reeves kill someone with a gun? The idea that 40 gunmen can't stop him is also ridiculous. Why didn't they post two snipers in that club who would shoot him as soon as he entered. Really, no one other human, no matter how many, can hit this man with a gun? It all gets super repetitive and ridiculous. By the end it was just boring. Yes, good acting, good filming, etc. it get's all that, and the 'world' they created was OK, the only reason it gets a 6 not a 4 or 5. Really, skip this one.",6,13,32,2 November 2014
World War Z," Better than expected, I've seen all these movies, this is top 10
","I'm not sure why the critics seem to be harsh on this. This is exactly what an 'end of world' zombie movie should be like. What made this one so great was the fact that the film gave you a sense of the worldwide nature of the catastrophe. The amazing set pieces, overhead shots, views of other cities, aircraft carrier, refugee zones, airports, etc. For once an end of world film gave you the sense of scale here and this made is super frightening. Compare to 'The Walking Dead' where all the action takes place in a compact area, a farm, a jail, a small town. You get no feeling for how this is affecting the country, let alone the world. Same for most of these movies -- you get a quick intro with a larger set piece, and then the film gets micro - you see a group of survivors in one small area, with zombie attacks, etc. So this is what makes World War Z simply awesome. The Jerusalem sequences are perhaps the best ever filmed for this type of movie. I also like the aircraft carrier scenes, seems realistic of where the last stand would take place. Only at the end of this movie do you get a smaller set, but it is effective. And again, by taking place in another country, the international scale of the war becomes apparent and tickles the imagination. Ten of out 10.",10,14,28,1 July 2013
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Much better than the reviews, actions packed FUN
","Forget the reviews that focus on dialogue (it's a comic book character, of course it's clichéd) or other types of thing you may look for in movies like a Room With A View. In this movie you want to see cool action, cool use of superpowers, great fights with CGI that is not obvious and some tension about what happens next. This movie has it all. Academy awards? No. Amazing plot? No, but enough to keep it very interesting, with answers like where Adamantium comes from, Sabretooth and Wolverine relationship, introduction of Deadpool, early view of Cyclops, and much more that keeps the movie going along just fine. This is a solid action film, better than most.",8,200,333,4 May 2009
Divergent," Only the Haters wrote reviews -- see this movie, it's good
","For some reason the rating is 7.7 with 1000s of data points, but the written reviews trash the movie -- ignore them, the numerical score is accurate. I read the books and saw the movie and thought both were very good -- not incredible, but good, deserving of 8 out of 10. One the key complaints is the same one you always hear when a movie is adapted to a book: how could they have not included scene/event/character x,y or z from the book? So and so does this in the book, but in the movie they do y. And so on. Give me a break. Does this really need to be repeated? You can't really convert a book perfectly into a 2 hour movie. You just can't. Characters get cut, shortcuts are made to the plot. Live with it or don't see the movie. Getting to the movie itself now. Yes, there are flaws and some logical missteps. But overall, the world that is created is visually appealing and interesting, the character (especially Woodley) do a good job, and the last portion, while a bit rushed perhaps, is engaging. I would say that the source material itself is not 10 out of 10 material, and the movie conforms to my rating -- very good, but not a 9 or a 10. If you can get over the book/movie thing, you will enjoy this movie.",8,121,258,24 March 2014
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Entertaining but mediocre; never any danger or wonderment
","While I was entertained overall, I found myself bored at times especially during the actions scenes. The CGI has gone too far and poisoned the film making process. The dwarfs and Bilbo are constantly attacked or in peril, but in a very hectic over the top way that conveys no real sense of danger. 1,000 goblins can attack but you know nothing will happen. The Dwarfs can fall 100 stories, but are always safe -- worse, you know nothing will happen. Instead of frenzied, over the top, impossible to believe CGI with things tumbling and high speeds from every direction, it would have been much better for smaller, more subtle battles that perhaps used real stunts and not flooded the screen with tons of fake CGI. It felt more like a computer game at times. Other than that it then felt a bit like a rehash of LOTR with Elrond, Galadriel, etc. The only truly effective scenes were those with Gollum. 7 out of 10.",7,3,12,17 December 2012
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," The CGI has gone too far. Apes looked fake --> movie looks fake
","The movie was mildly entertaining but so much of it was lost by the terrible use of CGI. Whatever happened to using trained apes or even people in suits for this type of work? Maybe only used CGI to enhance the movie? This is what ruined it for me. I won't go into plot details, but even from the previews you could tell that these CGI apes moved like they were in some kind of video game. And since the apes are in almost every scene, in fact the protagonist is an Ape, the whole movie feels like watching a video game. CGI has been so abused that you need to go back to older movies like Alien & Aliens and Die Hard to see action and sci-fi done right.",6,2,5,30 January 2012
Drive," SOOOOO Over-hyped....above average, but that's all
","Seriously, this is the 101st best movie EVER (as of Sept 24 on IMDb). The storyline here is so clichéd, so uninteresting. Driver get's on the bad side of mobsters, so goes around and kills them all one by one. WOW, brilliant plot line. Let's throw in a girl and a kid to make us care a bit more. Drive -- I thought there would be some good driving. Mildly decent opening sequence, and then one chase sequence later on, but not enough. I can name you a dozen movies from the 70s with much better chase scenes -- I think with CGI this art has been lost. The dreamy feel to the movie and pacing were actually good and are the only aspect that make this film above average. But the story line is so dull, so unoriginal. Not even a twist to make it interesting. This was an above average movie, that's all. I am STUNNED of the reviews. So at 101 best ever this movie is better than: Die Hard, Fargo, The Big Lebowski, The Deer Hunter, Annie Hall, The Graduate, The Terminator and Rosemary's Baby. Unreal ! My theory is that many IMDb users are young (late teens to 20s) and simply have not seen enough movies to compare and realize that Drive is clichéd. I'm in my 40s and have seen over 4,000 movies in my life, including 400-500 from the 1970s. I suggest a film fan start with this decade and then come back and tell me if Drive is really best ever material.Bottom line -- a fine, watchable movie. 6, maybe 7 stars at most. But the over hyping will make it disappointing for you if you go into it having read all these amazing reviews.",Null,3,7,24 September 2011
Meet Joe Black," Good movie, just dragged about undermining what could have been great
","VERY few movies should be 3 hours long. The story line and characters have to be far more complex to justify such a lengthy film. Meet Joe Black is compelling and for the most part it is all well done. Why did the filmmakers feel the need to extend this so long? Especially the last act. I could easily cut out 30 minutes of fluff, probably an hour and still kept the main themes of the movie intact. 6 stars, undermined by the unnecessary length.",6,0,1,13 February 2020
Elysium," Could've been a 10 -- Logical Flaws Sink Movie
","I really wanted to come out of this movie rating it a 10. It started off that way, and I have to say the special effect and scenery were flawless. Distopian LA of the future was well done, and the weapons and ships were great. The first half of the movie was a 10, but then it became a bit muddled, and then the logical flaws became to much to bear. I get that it is a movie but at some point, it has to make sense. Here are some of the many flaws (MANY SPOILERS AHEAD:1. It's hard to believe that Elysium has no cover. Really, a ship can just fly in? Doesn't the air escape? Even if not, wouldn't you want to cover it so rogue ships can't get in? Wouldn't there be a separate external space dock? 2. At the end, the 'Spider' and his ship are just shown easily landing in Elysium. As the start of the movie they show the air defenses. Suddenly this ships lands no problem. With all the state of the art weapons and DNA signatures, etc. you mean to tell me they had no automated radar and defense systems? 3. Elysium in general seemed way underprotected. Again, given what was happening on Earth, it was ridiculously underprotected. 4. John Carlyle has one small shuttle with two robot troops in an easily accessible takeoff zone - really? He had to know he was a major target. The scene where he is so easily attacked is hard to believe. 5. Some Hispanic thieves are experts in surgery AND spaceflight? Come on! 5. Less of a big deal -- but if it was so easy to send automated ships with healing beds down to earth in minutes, why did Elysium not just do this? It would have kept the peace.I find it amazing that writers allow these major plot holes to occur. This could have been a 10.",7,0,1,28 August 2013
The Conjuring," Basic haunted house story, NOTHING new at all
","I give it a 6 out of 10 as it is a well executed film and fine and watchable, but nothing more. If you have seen lots of horror movies, you will immediately see this is the same old stuff, there is truly NOTHING new here. Family moves into house, slowly notices strange things like the typical doors moving, flashes of a ghost, kids seeing things that adults don't, kids yelling in middle of night and parents run in, go to the local 'ghost hunter,' ghost hunter comes and senses the evil presence, evil presence escalates attacks/possession, desperate attempts to remove evil presence, conclusion. Sound familiar? Movies like Insidious, The Possession, Mama, and Sinister are basically the EXACT same movie more or less. People who rate this a 7.6 have simply not seen enough movies to realize how hackneyed and dull this plot is.",6,3,5,21 November 2013
Easy A," 7.3 Rating?? Really?? Raters must be young, 5 at best
","I give this movie a five, and this is generous for this really weak movie. I point out Sixteen Candles is rated a 7, Fast Times at Ridgemont High is rated 7.2. Can anyone seriously say Easy A is a better movie? Breakfast Club, which this movie pays homage to, is a 7.9, so only slightly better? Give me a break. Raters just throw out numbers without any context. A 7.2 means a WELL above average movie. Average in a 1 to 10 scale is five or a six. This movie is low average at best, barely a FIVE. Simple plot, weak dialogue, and fails to capture the magic of growing up as a teen --- like the Hughes movies did. Emma Stone is likable and the only reason this movie is not a Four. I was generally bored, and saw no complexity or reason to follow this mostly trite plot. One of many unremarkable teen movies I have seen in the past few years, and I am a big fan of the genre.",5,7,14,31 December 2010
John Wick: Chapter 2," Boring and repetitive; one scene, run at Wick and get shot -- repeat 100 times
","Seriously, a 7.8 rating? It's basically Wick shooting cannon fodder over and over again in one setting or another. Maybe three decent fights worth watching. What's annoying is that dozens of gunmen simply run right at Wick -- no attempt at deception, no hiding behind cover, no ambushes, no coordinated attacks, no snipers sitting in waiting, no one else has body armor, just run right at Wick, one at a time, so he can just shoot you. It ruins the credibility of the action, like some bad Schwarzenneger movie. It's all well filmed and executed, for sure. I hope they don't make a #3.",4,0,1,19 June 2017
