Hereditary," Disturbing
","Ugh left me feeling ill, good acting at times and creepy at times but not 'scary' just disturbing. Demonic possession and lots of bad mojo. I don't recommend making yourself feel how this movie made me feel during and after watching it. Idk how it got such a high IMDb rating something I always use to determine if I'll watch a movie or not.",1,2,6,7 July 2018
