Blade Runner 2049," 'I've seen things you people wouldn't believe...'
","My memories of Blade Runner 2049 won't be washed away any time soon. More Blade Runner than Blade Runner? No. And yet this is what makes Blade Runner 2049 brilliant. Of course any consideration of Villeneuve's film must take account of the now sacrosanct original, and this is something Villeneuve himself has evidently been aware of from the outset. It is obvious throughout the film, tonally, thematically, musically, and in almost every other aspect that not only the director but the entire cast and crew hold a deep reverence for the original film, in a manner akin to its many fans. Again and again the film draws inspiration from Blade Runner, as the 'feel' of Scott's film imbues this sequel in its entirety, and yet, astoundingly, Villeneuve's production balances indebtedness with independence. Due to skillful and assured direction, emotionally nuanced performances, incisive cinematography and sound, and perhaps most importantly, some truly beautiful writing, this film has the strength to emerge from the shadow of Blade Runner and become its own distinct entity. In Blade Runner Roy Batty declares that it's 'quite a thing to live in fear', and yet Villeneuve's film manages to avoid this traumatic state, dreading neither the weight of the original nor the subsequent expectation upon its shoulders, as it cleverly recalls Scott's film whilst following its own direction. 2049 builds upon the eclectic themes of its predecessor in a thoughtful, moving and sometimes shocking manner, satisfying audience expectations given the arc of the original story - Villeneuve playfully echoes its diegetic and moral ambiguities - without ever sinking into the kind of palimpsestic homage we've witnessed in films such as The Force Awakens. Once again Gosling is on fine form, and whilst some critics might mistakenly interpret his performance as restricted and somewhat lifeless, he in fact offers both the quiet fortitude and humanity that the role demands; you can understand why he was so desired for the part. Stylistic and character based twists upon the original characters abound, and yet in reprising his role as Deckard Ford also excels, whilst the supporting cast are all committed and, crucially, in tune with the aura of the film. Jared Leto's performance is perhaps slightly melodramatic at points for some, however he is integral to some of the film's strongest moments (one very raw scene in particular stands out - you'll know it when you see it).My only criticism would be that at 163 minutes the film loses a little of the focused intensity which contributes to the original's brilliance, however the emotional payoff for this extended length is rewarding and not altogether misguided. In the end such criticisms are largely nitpicking, as the film excels in all areas and stands as one of the strongest releases of the year. Bravo to Villeneuve and co., they can certainly be proud of what they have produced. Perhaps the greatest compliment that can be paid is that much like Scott did so powerfully in his original (after the excision of certain studio-led material), Villeneuve and his team have produced a visually immersive, gripping and considered interrogation of questions central to not only those in the audience, and not even simply those in the world around them, but also those that will come after Blade Runner 2049's release. Consequently it feels as though this too will maintain its place in popular culture, and in doing so remind us of the power of cinema to understand humanity's past, present and future.",9,8,22,5 October 2017
