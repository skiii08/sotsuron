Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A dreary disappointment
","Has George Lucas lost the plot? Someone certainly seems to have mislaid the plot for this film - an hour in to this film I was so bored I almost fell asleep. Luckily, the pod race (highlight of the whole film) came along to perk things up.I can't believe Star Wars fans are excusing this by saying it's a curtain raiser for parts 2 and 3, or that it has to be seen in the context of the whole saga. Films are meant to ENTERTAIN, for goodness sake. I don't pay money to go to the cinema to watch extended trailers.Without Han Solo and Princess Leia, all we had was a procession of wooden characters speaking leaden dialogue in that irritating 'mock classical English' accent that George Lucas seems so keen on.George Lucas has taken Star Wars fans for granted, assuming that state-of-the-art special effects (which I felt gave the battle scene a cartoon-like quality) would be enough. Worryingly, it seems he was right",2,0,1,22 September 1999
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Instantly forgettable
","I went to see this with very low expectations, i.e. that it would be an improvement on The Phantom Menace. However, Jar Jar Binks aside, it even failed there. Amidala and Anakin were very wooden (not helped by another appalling George Lucas script). I can't believe that this pouty, stroppy pretty boy turns into Darth Vader, a character who oozed charisma and menace.The other major failing was that it was just so tedious. George Lucas should be strapped into a chair and forced to watch Spider-Man to see how a blockbuster FX movie can have likeable, believable characters, a decent script and a fast-paced memorable plot. The only scenes I can really remember from this film are the one lifted from Blade Runner, and the one lifted from Gladiator.Just one other point. Amidala drops from a pillar over 20 feet high and lands astride some dinosaur-like creature. Without a pause for breath (let alone a shriek of agony) she rides off , totally unharmed. What are her thighs made of?",3,0,0,13 August 2002
Spider-Man," An entertaining movie.
","I am no fan of big FX summer blockbusters, and only saw the recent Star Wars movie due to my continuing affection for the original trilogy. I was quite surprised, therefore, that I enjoyed this film. It had everything that Attack of the Clones lacked - likeable, believable characters, a decent script and some fast-paced plotting. I don't know whether the sequel will be as good, as my favourite part of this film was when Peter Parker was coming to terms with his powers. A fully formed superhero is far less interesting. However, for once, I was not left thinking 'How can people watch/make/take part in this drivel?'",7,0,0,13 August 2002
Toy Story 2," Even Better Than Toy Story
","How is it that a computer generated animated movie can have more believable characters (yes, I know they're toys), better dialogue, a more involving plot, and more 'humanity' (for want of a better word) than any live action film I have seen in the past five years?This film is simply brilliant - tightly plotted and fast-moving, funny, exciting, and yet with a warmth at the heart of it that is lacking in most of Hollywood's output. This film should have beaten American Beauty to the 'Best Picture' Oscar, yet it wasn't even nominated.After Toy Story, I had high expectations of this film and feared a major let-down. I needn't have worried.",10,0,1,21 March 2003
