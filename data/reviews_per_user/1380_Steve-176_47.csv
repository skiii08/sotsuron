The Blair Witch Project," Kid's Stuff
","As scary as The Exorcist? No way!The Blair Witch Project is however unsettling, memorable; one of those films that can leave you with thoughts and flashbacks for days.It has an unnerving, believable feel encouraged by apparently very real reactions from the actors. But such flamboyance is never accidental.The film for all of its apparent naturalness is carefully set up.I'd like to emphasise that the actors are still alive! I've been amazed by the number of people who believe that the whole thing is real!This film has taken on a life of its own. There was and still is a very successful internet presence for the movie. Film site surfers have become the nucleus of a solid and enthusiastic retinue of fans itching for a certain kind of scare.Younger film goers find it very fashionable to have seen the film, resulting in a cult phenomenon that is in full swing. Seeing this movie is a bit like owning the best designer wear.Perversely, the fact that The Blair Witch Project was made for only a pittance by a couple of  film students, has given the film street credibility.  It has low budget (big profit) grunge glamour.But mainly people are flocking to see this because they're looking for a good scare.But they don't want to be terrified. Most people never want that in movie houses. The fact that The Blair Witch Project is about as frightening, and has the same air, as a ride on an amusement park Ghost Train isn't a huge disincentive for the teen audience to whom this film will really appeal.So what of the film. We are told during the opening credits that in 1994 three film makers went into a wooded  area in search of a legendary witch: 'A year later, their footage was found.'The film makers were never seen again, but from their film we find out what happened to them. A documentary is made and that's The Blair Witch Project.This film was written and directed by two young American auteurs, Eduardo Sanchez and Dan Myrick. They conceived the idea, scripted the film (without dialogue), trained their three main actors Heather Donahue, Michel Williams, and Joshua Leonard for two days on how to work the cameras and sent them into the woods to make this 'documentary'.  Of course we don't see the rest of the production crew.This worked remarkably well. The actors, able to ad lib at will while they were doing the filming threw themselves into this horror story. They probably at times frightened themselves.Sanchez and Myrick then spent eight months editing the footage, getting it to look as much as possible like a rough story  of the deaths of three terrified people.The film is grainy, the cameras hand held and the editing rough. The original mood is jocular when the trio begin their project with some lead up interviews with local fishermen and the like, boning up on the folk lore that surrounds the myth of the Blair Witch.They go to the woods. As the days progress and the witch closes in, the tension mounts like in all good horror movies. The three start to bicker with one another. Formerly subservient characters become more dominant. A leader makes a tearful confession to the camera.And what of the camera. The desire to document is only one reason for keeping filming. Why do they keep filming as they even die?The answer has never been more obvious. Watching the world through a lens is like wearing a mask or taking on another personality, or acting. It divorces the camera operator from what he or she is seeing through the lens.And that's damn handy if something horrible is trying to murder you.And if you're filming as you are running, especially in terror, the camera will swing. Those prone to motion sickness might be disorientated.",Null,0,1,19 December 1999
Antz," Too Clever By Half
","There's no doubt that the technical advances in the film making business are downright amazing. The insects  in Antz (don't ya just lurve the spelling???) are completely computer generated by the Dream Works studio in association with Jeffrey Katzenberg and Steven Speilberg. The industry has come a long long way since those few tortuous bits of bytes in Jurassic Park not all that many years ago. But sometimes we humans can get just a little bit too clever, or perhaps not smart enough, and Antz, although commendable, has neither the fantasy element needed for a good children's film, nor the realism needed for a decent adults flick. Antz is pretty entertaining, and visually it is every bit as stunning as Toy Story, although Antz is more sophisticated and  has a much darker look than the suburban Toy Story.  As you can imagine, much of the action in Antz takes place underground. Antz tells of an ant called Z (voiced by Woody Allen) who doesn't want to just be one of the crowd. He has an illicit romance with a princess ant (Sharon Stone) and they break the mould and come into conflict with the status quo. There are heaps of references to politics, movie genres, sexual angst and therapy, as you'd expect from a story  starring a Woody Allen type off character. But can an animated film effectively portray complicated emotions? Not so far it seems. The ants in Antz have faces that are almost human, but that then becomes disappointing, because so far the craft hasn't got any where near being able to really display the complexities of a human face.We love faces. We spend our lives studying the extremely subtle messages a tiny tremor of an eyebrow or lip might portray; to such an extent that we often don't even consciously realise how subtle we are as observers. If film makers are going to step towards trying to depict real human faces on animated creatures, and not leave animated films where they have been so far; a film world where it is obvious that the creatures, the faces, and the personalities are only two dimensional and shallow, then they will continue to disappoint movie goers.",Null,0,0,25 October 1998
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Poorly Directed
","I hesitate to say anything bad at all about the latest Star Wars flick. But ...Star Wars Episode 1 is a disappointment. And I'm a fan of Sci Fi movies and of the original three films, even if they do look dated these days.George Lucas the writer/director of the Star Wars series describes them as a 'Saturday afternoon serial for children' and this description is particularly apt for this episode. If you're over 10 years old don't expect too much.After all it wasn't the special effects but the characters who made the original three films entertaining. They had larrikins we cared about, and there was a good dollop of sexual tension. Would Hans Solo and Princess Leila get it together? And where did Skywalker fit in.Hans Solo and the Wookie were rascals with good hearts. R2D2 and C3PO were funny. There was an epic feel to the story, and then there was that mysterious business with The Force.Darth Vader was awesome and we were surprised when we found out who he was. All of these elements made the first three films fun, majestic and mysterious. That rush into The Death Star was tension filled and when Skywalker closed his eyes and 'Trusted The Force' we had to believe in The Force as well. It worked.So what have we got in The Phantom Menace. No larrikins at all. No Harrison Ford character. It's never funny but remains serious or even worse, seriously unfunny throughout. The robot sidekicks have basically been replaced with and annoying, non understandable no brainer called Jar Jar Binks. Who cares if he's completely digital. He's not entertaining.Darth Vader has been replaced by Darth Maul (Ray Park who's apparently a martial arts star) but there's no sign at all of the majesty and terror that pervaded Darth Vader. Where was that swishing black cape and breathy, sinister voice!And who knows whether Ray Park can act. Darth Maul like the rest of the cast give performances that have the look of second grade amateur theatrics.This is the film's greatest problem. Perhaps the wooden performances that are universal in this film are due to the actors having to perform so often to blue screens to which were later added digital characters. But we would have to suspect that George Lucas really wasn't interested in his actors.He hasn't directed a film for 22 years since Star Wars 3. He has instead done lots of wonderful work on digital effects with his company ILM, exhibiting state of the art wonders in films like Jurassic Park, but his preoccupation hasn't been with flesh and blood actors. Lead Liam Neeson, undoubtedly a first class actor, has been quoted as saying that he won't do another film and will retreat to the stage after his experience on Lucas's film.The Phantom Menace is an outstanding special effects film but it lacks human interest. There has been a phenomenal amount of marketing hype associated with the movie but I wonder how successful the box office figures will be, especially for the next two in the series, if they are as stiff, dry and humourless as this one.George, hire a director for the next two!",Null,2,4,6 June 1999
Training Day," Tough cop shows rookie the ropes, L.A. cop style. Great performances. Strong direction. Violent. Eratic plot. 3 Flys.Out of Five
","Denzel Washington sure can play a great bad guy. In Training Day he plays Alonzo Harris the cop you'd just have to hate, unless you were as corrupt and violent as this mean b*****d is. But then he has locked away a good many criminals.He takes into his charge young Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) who hopes to make it into Alonzo's elite drug squad and in one rather hectic day shows Jake the ropes. `To protect the sheep you gotta kill the wolf and it takes a wolf to kill the wolf,' is Alonzo's mantra and he belts Jake about both morally and physically, in the name of justice, L.A. cop styleI hated Training Day for nearly all of its length but certainly not because it's a poorly made movie. It's just that it painted such an unrelenting picture of nastiness, selfishness and thuggery, and presented this message strongly as being the only right, proper and effective way of dealing with Alonzo's environment.  The softer side of me just screamed for civility, niceness and the rule of law.But not Alonzo's street law. If the world is or might become really like this, especially in my town, well, we'd be in big trouble.Bad, vigilante cop movies aren't rare. Training Day is a beauty though, graced with a very good cast, a strong if erratic script from David Ayer (The Fast and the Furious, U-571) and exciting direction from Antoine Fuqua (Bait, The Replacement Killer).The performances are remarkable especially from Denzel Washington who discards that kind, lovable, demeanour of his to show just how terrific is his acting ability. Ethan Hawke complements Washington and that's a complement.Cameo's from Snoop Dogg and in particular Macy Gray as an embittered housewife are very strong as is Scott Glenn's as former cop Roger.Training Day often stretches credibility, particularly in it's final stages, but its intensity overcomes those sorts of reservations.  It's not the sort of film I'd recommend for entertainment. If you enjoy tension and fine performances and you can take violence not too far to heart then Training Day could fuel your passions.3 Well Trained Flys Out of Five",Null,1,11,19 November 2001
Fight Club," Disturbing
","Fight Club is impossibly negative and depressing, but many won't care. There's a message somewhere in Fight Club but if you really get off on screen violence, well, so what.Fight Club is very well made, so well produced that it's disturbing. Everyone will enjoy it on that level. But will you send their mates along to grovel in the violence?There are some delicious moments of black humour but the overall feel of Fight Club just isn't funny. It's Falling Down grown up. It's Mortal Kombat with real mortal combat. It's an Artless Raging Bull.It's apocalyptic if you take it seriously enough. But for most of the population Fight Club will be just a good ol' parade of blood and smashed teeth.Fight Club contends that many American males these days have become so bored and ground down by paying the mortgage in an essentially meaningless society that they have become pathologically desperate.And for a moment I believed it. You'd have to! There's a call to arms at one stage, the mantra is recited in the bowels of Fight Club World. The thugs were mesmerised and so was I. There it was. Fanaticism. Madness. A boys club with sharp teeth.A visionary and bully called Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) starts forming secret clubs where men meet for vicious fights. Men flock to the Fight Clubs because they find that the pain and solidarity they find there bring meaning to their lives.Soon Durden is forming an army of disenchanted men who are willing to follow his anarchistic programs. Durdan plans to rip society apart, destroy commerce and ruin order.We're never told what Durdan envisages might come from this chaos, but you wouldn't expect much from organised thugs, would you.There is a secret but as I've said Fight Club isn't really about the philosophy of political systems or about run-amok commercialism. Fight Club is about violence and grot. It's about boys (not girls) getting their shirts off, forgetting about Mum and bashing the hell out of each other.The stars give superb performances. Edward Norton (Primal Fear, American History X) plays Narrator with the intensity and intelligence we've come to expect from him. Brad Pitt is strong in a film which seems to suit him admirably. (Perhaps that's a worry!)Helena Bonham Carter, escaped from English costume dramas for a change does a good job of slumming it as Marla Singer, although a million actresses could eat up that sort of overacting.Meat Loaf with bitch tits is just fine as the slobbing, sobbing Big Bob but I was mesmerised mostly by the slashing direction by David Fincher (Aliens 3, Seven). His use of sound in particular was superb.Fight Club is essentially what was called a few years ago an Action Movie, but a very well made action flick. Violence rules, damn the plot, particularly philosophy.There are a couple of ideas hidden by a thick smear of blood, outstanding production values and it does closely mirror Chuck Palahniuk's novel. But hell if I want to be depressed I'll watch the news.Meanwhile men pleasing themselves in their own Fight Club, kicking in heads on Shields Street on a Friday night, scream 'we are the news!'.",Null,0,1,20 November 1999
Shakespeare in Love," Terrific Script
","What a wonderful conceit! Imagine being at the first performance of Romeo And Juliet, in a London theatre all those years ago, and Will Shakespeare himself is playing Romeo!Shakespeare In Love was co-written with Marc Norman by Tom Stoppard. They also penned Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead; a marvellous play which retold Hamlet from the point of view of two of Hamlet's minor characters.Their latest film imagines that Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) wrote Romeo And Juliet when he himself was a star crossed lover and that his Juliet was Viola (played by Gwyneth Paltrow). She plays Juliet against his Romeo on stage with him!Now that's a delightful idea and only one aspect of what is a very witty and clever script. There's a good deal of pleasure to be had enjoying the many references to a good number of the Bard's famous lines from his other plays.The film has a lot of fun with Shakespeare's rivalry with contemporary playwright Thomas Marlow and with the sheer mechanics of getting a play onto the stage especially if the money has dried up and if there's a bad case of writer's block.And how better to overcome a wilting of the quill than with a rich lover like Viola. She's pledged to another man and they are denied one another. As they play out the Romeo And Juliet scenes in real life, they later create the same magic on the stage, triumphantly. Shakespeare In Love even manages to bring some life to the acting of the wooden Gwyneth Paltrow.Geoffrey Rush's part is fun but you'd think a little light on for an Academy Award but Judi Dench as the elderly Queen Elizabeth is masterful. Jo Fiennes is a bit too even throughout the film but the music from Australian composer David Hirschfelder, the sets and particularly the script is first class.And  I'll be always grateful for the recreation of that original Romeo And Juliet performance.",Null,0,0,14 February 1999
The 13th Warrior," Looks Terrific!!!
","Sword epics with Vikings will always be a favourite for me.	The swish of one of those huge broad swords and the metallic ring as they slice through a neck rank right up there with the cinematic, machinic, muted roar of spaceships and the false squeal of tires on dirt roads.	Leif Ericson in The Tales Of The Vikings 1960's T.V. series helped fill my young world. I suppose that imagining that I was Nordic and lopping off English heads was preferable to being a cowboy and picking on the hapless Red Indians.	The likes of Kirk Douglas, Tony Curtis, Ernest Borgnine, Frank Thring and Janet Leigh in movies like The Vikings (1958) made for pretty good childhood fantasies and I reckon that sometimes it's O.K. not to grow up.	In The 13th Warrior Jose Antonio Dominguez Banderas stars as Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan. Other characters include Herger The Joyous, Buliwyf (perhaps he was the red headed one with the Scottish accent), Melchisidek (Omar Sharif in a cameo) and Queen Weilew who was played by the less glamourously named Diane Venora.	Don't worry too much about her though. She's just there to pat Ibn's brow, and other things belonging to Ibn, between battles.	But those names do have a certain broad sword ring to them don't they.	The idea is that Arab poet Ibn (Banderas) has been lusting after the wrong woman in Court and has been sent off as some sort of diplomat to the Vikings who have a spot of bother. 	 A village is being besieged by mad demons. 13 warriors must go and Banderas must help out. 	And so the carnage begins. This I repeat is the only reason for the movie.	The romantic bits are only by play, bloody foreplay for the real thing.	Big, sweaty, longhaired, fellows with names that these days would end in son do heroic battle with very nasty adversaries who delight in taking the heads of their victim's home with them as keepsakes.	The plot is that simple. Michael Crichton's novel upon which the film was supposedly based (it's now over 25 years old) was I'd imagine thrown onto a fat splattered campfire early in the production and the blood letting began. And Crichton is a co-writer of the film.	The 13The Warrior was directed by John McTiernan who's credits include Predator, The Hunt For Red October, The Thomas Crown Affair and Die Hard and it was filmed by Peter Menzies Jr. I mention this because this film looks superb.	This cross between The Last Of The Mohecans, The Conan films and Indiana Jones won't excite your thinking processes but lovers of the art of action cinematography are in for a treat.",Null,0,0,13 March 2000
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Uncut?
","Uncut? Unlikely. South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut is very, very rude and very often hilarious but it could and should have gone much further.I'd say that either the producers got cold feet or they just ran out ideas. But still the result is often a scream.The movie is in the form of a Disney musical and at first the lyrics are delightfully seditious, very South Park. It's a shame that the songs, and there are many of them, become straight. They BECOME Disney musical numbers and that is where South Park gets a bit boring.But there is plenty to feast on before the next yawn.The charm for me in the television series of South Park lies largely in the innocence of the South Park kids. They say and do awful things but hardly ever have any real idea of what they are up to.For instance, one of the boys falls in love with his lesbian teacher and his Dad jokingly tells him that if he wants to impress her he'll  have to learn how to 'lick carpet'. So that's what we later see the boy do. He literally licks carpet! What's a lesbian?In this film version, the satire is, if anything, more intense and more offensive than the TV series. Fans will be pretty delighted. Puritans should probably not attend.I do recommend however that all grade 8 children should be taken to see the film by their schools, and especially that the teachers attend. Most young students will see it anyway one way or the other and at least then the teachers will know where the obscenities that will erupt from sweet little mouths have come from.And I would hope that teachers would find much of South Park hilarious. At least then we could be sure that our children are being properly prepared for life with the proper amount of skepticism!South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut has a strong dig at Canadians for some reason or another, Australians fleetingly and  exults in a  wonderful smack at Bill Gates and Microsoft.Hey I was one of those who cheered and applauded in the cinema when Windows 98 was deliciously maligned. There must be a good deal of resentment (or is it envy) sucked deep within this little Windows victim, and a good many others as well, judging by the comments coming from around the world on the internet re the film.Some plot elements. Satan is Gay, a nice guy and he's being literally screwed by Saddam Hussein! It's the mothers who are the reactionaries. One of the teachers is recruited to become a state executioner and Winona Ryder is very, very clever with ping pong balls.But there are many more rude and crude words in South Park than Winona Ryder can fit ping pong balls within herself. But remember. It is indeed true that words can never really hurt you. At least words from eight year olds.",Null,0,0,19 July 1999
Elizabeth," Send For The Aussies
","Elizabeth It's telling I think that Channel Four in England has hired two 'colonials', Australians Cate Blanchett and Geoffrey Rush, to play the leads in its latest historical drama Elizabeth.  Yet another example of the ol' dart realising that it sent the best of the best away to Aussie 200 years ago. They need us back it seems! Elizabeth is an historical drama about Elizabeth 1, the 'virgin queen', known as 'the most unwelcome royal daughter of English History'; the bastard daughter of King Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn. Elizabeth came to the throne in 1533 on the death of Queen (Bloody) Mary. The tussle between the Protestants and the Catholics was in full swing. Elizabeth was a Protestant, was week politically and in experience and was enticed to marry into one of the nearby waring nations to consolidate the power of England. Elizabeth had seen her mother and her stepmother (Katherine Howard) murdered and was well in line for an early death herself. That she survived and went on to reign with some strength in England for 45 years, and that she never married, lends this royal as a worthy topic for bio pics! Elizabeth R, an excellent 6  part, 1971 TV mini-series has already introduced us to a ferociously strong performance as Elizabeth by Glenda Jackson and to just one version of what Elizabeth was really like. Australian Cate Blanchett has defined, with every bit as much force as the great Glenda Jackson, another fascinating and powerfully realised Elizabeth. Cate Blanchett is a product of the strong Sydney Belvoir Street Theatre and really stuns as Elizabeth. She's come to most notice on the screen before Elizabeth in Oscar And Lucinda and in Thank God He Met Lizzy. She has star quality written all over her. Toowoomba born Geoffrey Rush plays Sir Francis Walsingham, who imbues Elizabeth's chief spy with a subtlety that is breath taking. Rush has most notably to date won an Oscar for his portrayal of the adult David Helfgott in Shine and was also recently seen on screen in Les Miserables as Javert, in another very impressive performance. Elizabeth was directed by The Bandit Queen's Shekhar Kapur, a cross cultural choice that has produced a challenging production; a film that is full of both intrigue and mayhem as well as a mesmerising, almost distracting beauty. So we have the butchery that stood for politics in 16th century England displayed against beautifully lit interiors and all of the accoutrements of historical drama. It could be argued that these contradictions could lessen the effect of both of these elements but the power of Elizabeth briskly and effectively shrugs of any such argument. Elizabeth is complex, harrowing and beautiful all at once. Cate Blanchett and Geoffrey Rush are stunning and so is Elizabeth",Null,0,0,25 October 1998
Blade," Slick Thirsty Vampires
","Vampire film lovers will probably love Blade, a stylish, gory action vampire flick with plenty of big drinks. Wesley Snipes who also co-produced Blade stars as the Marvel Comics sad hero, and he looks great in the part. He understands the tempo and tradition of Marvel's hero vampire. Snipes is big, he's mean and at the same time vulnerable; an ideal comic book super hero. Blade is in the tradition of Dark City, the Crow and Spawn but for my money is heaps better than any of the others, but aficionados will no doubt have their own favourites. My prejudice will always swing towards the good ol' vampire flick any day, so no doubt I'm no judge, especially regarding the two Crow flicks which I didn't like at all. As for Dark City and Spawn, well they weren't much good by any measure. Blade's mission is to kill off vampires. He's the strange son of a Drac; his mother was bitten while he was in utero. He's half beast, half human and is sustained by a concoction he injects periodically which is prepared by his mentor and protector Whistler (Kris Kristofferson). Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff), also half human and half vampire is the head bad guy, and for someone who's not an obvious choice for the height of evil in a flick like this, he's neither big nor ugly, Dorff is very credible as an adversary for Blade. The twists for this vampire flick largely revolve around hi-tech weapons and environments. The vampires gather at a disco where they indulge in their own version of a foam party. Blade mixes modern haematology, biological warfare and garlic mace with old fashioned blades, silver (very large) bullets and shotguns. Crosses aren't in but garlic mace is very handy accessory if you're in questionable company. Blade isn't one of those psychological vampire flicks; the set ups are obviously orientated towards the next mass brawl. The sexual element, a seminal characteristic of the vampire myth isn't emphasised all that much either but there are still copious exchanges of bodily fluids. Vampire films are fairly rare in mainstream cinema, the last one was the surprising From Dusk Till Dawn. Blade is both rare and well done.",Null,0,1,18 October 1998
The Mummy," Indiana Again!
","Idiana Jones lives again! The Mummy is a determined recreation of those terrific Harrison Ford films and a successful one at that.Director Stephen Somers was also responsible for the bomb Deep Rising which shows that we should allow one or two disasters from directors. He also directed the excellent Tom And Huck in 1995 which starred the brilliant Elijah Wood.So who's the new Harrison Ford?  Why it's Brendan (Encino Man) Fraser. The Mummy has many of the elements of the Indiana Jones movies but in particular a similar, special, fun filled action formula mixed with a good dollop of semi religious mumbo jumbo.In The Mummy's case the religiosity is to do with the ancient Egyptians, their tombs and their mummified ancestors.As well as the good looking, funny Brendan Fraser as Rick, we have an attractive heroine Evelyn (Rachel Weisz), her bumbling brother Jonathon (John Hannah from Sliding Doors). The slimy link man Beni is played by Kevin J O'Connor.The bad guy in The Mummy is dead. He's played by Arnold Vosloo, although in his digital form he's yet another George Lucas, I.L.M. creation.  He's scary then with a mouth that opens a full hands breath. And what comes out is not only breath and it's not pleasant.By the way it was George Lucas who wrote the story lines for both of the Indiana Jones films. And Stephen Speilberg was the director.So off our heroes go to find the ancient tomb at Hamunaptra, the City of the Dead, where the adventurers hope to find great treasures including The Book Of The Dead. But of course there's a curse on the book and on the treasure.Sure enough when they get close to the goal the bad guys start to appear and some of this is pretty tense. It's also funny. There are some excellent sequences when some digital mummy warriors are having it out with their human adversaries. A head gets knocked off and the thing keeps swinging blindly with its sword.Meanwhile with a sword in one hand and an ancient book in the other, a hero is trying to cast the right spell to stop the mummies. It's amusing and exciting.And then there are the horrible scarab beetles who burrow into your skin and up into your brain, not to mention the seven plagues evoked on Egypt by the mummy. Locusts and  fireballs assault the land.Romance might blossom between Rick and Evelyn, you'd expect this in this sort of movie. And surely there will be quicksand and camel rides.The Mummy is Indiana swashbuckling at its best. Grab your scissors and bandages and howl in to the cinema to see it.",Null,0,0,17 June 1999
The Others," A mother and two children are living alone in a large Jersey house. Things seem a little strange. Very well crafted, moody haunted house thriller.
","Who hasn't known ghosts? I grew up listening to a man breathing in various cupboards around my house as I went to sleep. Both my mother and I heard him clearly. We didn't consider him malevolent, he was just there.	My wife and I have heard a very unhappy, spectral woman, in broad daylight, weeping loudly in a corridor of our former house, repeatedly, over two days.
        I certainly believe in ghosts! And I'm not particularly psychic. I've also known of a tall old cupboard that independently spooked certain guests to the house we were living in at the time. They'd back out of the room, uneasily. I'm sure that many of you can tell similar stories.	The Others is a very neatly made, subtle, measured, haunted house thriller starring Nicole Kidman.         It doesn't rely on digital effects to scare or unsettle the viewer, rather putting emphasis on strangeness. The early cues are auditory. We know we're in ghost territory when those violins start screeching in that time honoured spooky way.        There aren't many sudden bangs or shakes in this strange house, not extravagantly anyway, but we're led to expect that something nasty and frightening will happen. That's understood, hinted by the mood of this beautifully crafted film.        Nicole Kidman plays Grace, an overly protective mother looking after her children Anne and Nicholas in a large rural house on the island of Jersey just after WW2.         She's waiting for her husband to come home from the war. The children are apparently photosensitive and can't be allowed to come into contact with sunlight so all of the curtains are closed in the house and the doors are sequentially locked as Grace, the children and the staff move through the house.        The staff headed by Mrs Mills (fine Irish actress Fionnula Flanagan) get about their business within the rules set by their mistress.          Writer/director, Chilean born, Spain based, Alejandro Amenabar has created a moody, thriller. He also composed the music.        Nicole Kidman gives a fine performance again emphasising her superior acting skills. Grace is forceful but fraught, elegant but severe.         The tension rises.

We Were Soldiers," Recreation of the first big land battle of the Vietnam War. Lot's of deaths. Mel's a bit annoying. Not for most. 2 Flys Out Of Five
","We Were Soldiers, as you'd expect from the title, is a war film told from the American soldier's point of view.It's 1965 and the U.S. army has escalated their commitment to the Vietnam War. North Vietnamese Regular Army personnel at Ia Drang in the central Highlands of Vietnam had attacked American troops and then retreated. Chasing them, The American Seventh Cavalry fly into battle, and into an ambush, on their new steeds, the helicopter.Colonel Custer led a battalion of the same name, the First Battalion of the Seventh Cavalry, into a similarly risky battle many years before. Will this fight 10,000 miles from mainland America turn into another massacre?We Were Soldiers follows to large extent actual events of the time. This battle became the first major land battle between the Americans and the Vietnamese of the Vietnam War.The battalion was led by Lt. Col Hal Moore (Mel Gibson) who is now a sprightly eighty something year old. (He obviously survived!)Moore was a veteran of the Korean conflict and according to his biography, upon which the film is based, a student of the history of warfare.
He knew how effective the Vietnamese had been against the French only a few years before. And this was the first use like this of the helicopter in warfare.There's a long lead up to the battle, establishing the American troops as being parents and lovers to their wives. There's a good deal of knee bending. Moore was (is) Catholic. Then we're into battle with a bang, thousands of them. The firefight is intense and lasted unabated for days. We cut periodically back to the U.S. where we see the wives receiving telegrams informing them of the death of their husbands.The Vietnamese appear to be well drilled, heroic and surprisingly, neatly outfitted, and we're given some insights into the concerns of their officers as they try to cope with this new enemy. The Vietnamese were veterans. The Americans were only the latest invaders of their country. The locals had already seen off the Chinese and the French in the previous decades.Some attempt made to personalize the Vietnamese, even if not much effort was made to get appropriate extras. Not too many 1960's Vietnamese would have carried nearly as much body fat. I'm pretty sure I even spotted a black skinned, Negroid Vietnamese!And what of Mel Gibson as Lt. Col Hal Moore? Apart from being far too old, today's Hal Moore would be well over 100 years old if Mel was the right age, Gibson's facial ticks, ideal for crazy cops a decade ago, tend to be just annoying in We Were Soldiers.Sam Elliot as his offsider gets all the good lines. The photographer depicted in the movie wrote the book the film is based on with Hal Moore.But We Were Soldiers isn't riveting cinema. It's relentless, but those who really like war movies because of the violence will only enjoy it. Mel does Mel well. Has he ever done anything else? And those of you who might think that the final `victory', the rush up the hill, in the battle looked a bit strange will be reassured by the fact that reportedly it didn't happen.The Vietnamese in fact moved deeper into their tunnel complex because of devastating air bombardment, principally from B52 bombers. Not because of the no doubt heroic efforts of the Americans on the ground.The Vietnamese were heavily mauled in this battle. They retreated and regrouped to fight another day. The Americans were always outnumbered and less motivated on Vietnamese home soil.
A pattern was then set that continued until the Americans finally retreated in disarray from the country on April 30 1975. 2 Bloody Flys Out Of Five",Null,0,1,28 April 2002
The Beach," Kids Stuff
","Rinsing a potentially interesting movie in exotic Thai beach water and then perfuming it with the essence of Leonardo DiCaprio will probably make a few million for its producers but only because teenage girls (or more succinctly their parents!) buy that sort of rubbish.	There are hints of all sorts of things in The Beach but it actually delivers little more than Leo and scenery. Apocalypse Now, The Deer Hunter, Lord Of The Flys and The Blue Lagoon were given reference but all of those films, even Lagoon, had more coherence than this polluted, small, scenic stretch of sand.	Of course there are some high points and they deserve a quick and early mention just in case you think I'm not female and fourteen.	Robert Carlyle, always terrific is again remarkable as a Scottish madman in The Beach's Apocalyptic Martin Sheen scene. But he's only on show for about 15 minutes.	And call me corny but I thought that the video game sequence, while DiCaprio was doing his Deer Hunter bit, or was it Rambo, was funny.
	But the rest was a series of boys own adventures; those of a a not so Quiet American in a secluded Asian backpacker's resort.	Richard (DiCaprio) lands, as millions of young Americans have, in Thailand looking for cheep dope, women and a good time. He checks into a dingy hotel, meets the mad Daffy Duck (Carlyle) who for his own crazy reasons gives Richard a mysterious map.Richard heads off to find a mystical Beach with the French pair who he'd listened to screwing the night before through thin hotel walls.	An adventure of two later finds the intrepid trio crawling through a commercial field of dope trying to avoid a nasty lot of Thais with guns. (And I'm no botanist but i reckon that the so called plant exhibited was what we call in Cairns Stinking Roger.)	Anyway, da da, before you know it our heroes have escaped and have reached the beach we're all seeking; the one where just about everyone is slim, definitely childless and in holiday mood. Endless beach volleyball, group singing, great weather and plenty of drugs oil a sweet little world where all we have to do is wait for Richard to do his business with the French girl.	Then boy fights off shark, loses girl and as well his mind for the Lord Of The Flys/Rambo bit. All ends happily a little later though with a happily reconstituted stars not receiving a heart warming letter but, because this is the noughties, an email.	DiCaprio is a fine leading actor here paying the dues (in his case making millions) as a pin up boy for Hollywood. Director Danny Boyle delighted (disgusted) us with Trainspotting and Shallow Grave before this tripe tripped his C.V.	But hey, I wish I could find a beach like that. Hollywood surely is a place of dreams.",Null,0,1,13 March 2000
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Poorly written with wooden acting and a few good special effects set pieces. Get out the old ones on video. 2 Flys Out Of Five
","Why in the Galaxy doesn't George Lucas hire a director for his Star Wars films, someone who's interested in actors? Lucas could then concentrate on what he does very well indeed, managing the special effects.Star Wars  Episode 11: The Attack of the Clones is marred by terrible acting, lousy dialogue and a lead footed story line. There are, as you'd expect, several impressive high tech set pieces, but they become just plain boring when fleshed out by characters who seem to be sleepwalking.The tall, elongated creatures who build the clones are just plain beautiful and the snarling spotted beast doing battle with the Jedi beasts was impressive, but that's not enough to fill in two hours of supposed entertainment.Star Wars freaks might find the film fascinating but it really shouldn't leap to anyone's must see list, in spite of its huge promotional budget. Get out the old ones on video instead! George Lucas directed the original Star Wars way back in 1977 but then hired Richard Marquand for Return of the Jedi (1983) and Irvin Kershner for The Empire Strikes Back (1985).Lucas directed American Graffiti in 1973 which was a quality film, but has directed nothing else of note. More pointedly, he's directed nothing at all for 22 years, until the awful Star Wars: Episode 1  The Phantom Menace (1999).He's instead been a giant in the special effects field with his ILM (Industrial Light and Movement) company showing the way for decades. Those dinosaurs in Jurassic Park, the liquid metal man in Terminator 2, the water creature in The Abyss, even the completely digital movies like Toy Story were at least off shoots of the innovations of the ILM camp.So George Lucas has been and remains at the forefront of film technology. But the last two Star Wars films must serve as evidence that Lucas should stay away from real live actors.Then he might have lively performances like those of Harrison Ford and the Wookie from the earlier films to add to the magic of film fantasy.If ever there was proof that digital actors won't usurp live actors, then its there in Star Wars  Episode 11: The Attack of the Clones.Two Digital Flys Out Of Five",Null,1,2,20 May 2002
10 Things I Hate About You," Lively and not hateful at all!
","Yet another teen flick that ends at the Prom! But still 10 Things I Hate About You is lively enough to be reasonably appealing.And at no stage were 10 things listed about anyone! That bit must have hit the edit room floor.This is pretty familiar territory. Boy likes girl. She doesn't like him. Someone is bribed to go out with someone he doesn't like. He falls for her. She finds out. You get the idea.There's a Shakespearean spin on this version though. There's a shrew and so we have a taming of the shrew. The school is called Padua High and the shrew is called Kat and her surname is Stratford.But really it would be stretching it to call this Shakespeare and most of its intended audience wouldn't even notice.Full marks for Padua High though. The buildings really look stunning and are used to great effect, especially in a final pan with surprise, surprise, a rock band on the roof.And would that band notice or care about the over reactive acting style that infects these types of films? They probably wouldn't because most teenagers are like this in the company of their peers. Under developed personalities are by definition shallow, even if this trait is amply compensated for by enthusiasm and embarrassment.But I still couldn't help wonder how actors who are obviously adults can hope to pull off the idea that they are children in these films.There aren't too many school age actors who can pull off mature acting performances. There aren't that many actors like Natalie Portman, Winona Ryder, Juliette Lewis and Leonardo DiCaprio;  who have had the magic touch at a suitably young age.10 Things I Hate About You hasn't revealed any more of these either. They didn't even try. In particular Australian actor Heath Ledger looked unlikely to be of school age. And when he slides back into his school desk after a night out drinking and playing pool with his bikie mates, well it seemed a bit rich.But that's all irrelevant, especially since school agers seeing the film would probably much rather see someone who's as adult as Heath playing the hero anyway. Why aspire to pimples?Anyway the dialogue is smart, the school looks good, the music is bouncy and the characters are interesting in spite of their shallowness.",Null,16,35,17 June 1999
Notting Hill," The Princess And The Toad
","Hugh Grant as Cinderella? Notting Hill stretches the believable as much as any mainstream comedy romance.'The most famous movie star in the world' Anna Scott  (Julia Roberts) throws herself at a love lorn bookseller (Hugh Grant) and whisks him away into her life. Then, no doubt, they live happily ever after in her movie star castle.Notting Hill was written and directed by the same team, Richard Curtis and Roger Michell,who created the very successful (and much more satisfying) Four Weddings And A Funeral. They have been reasonably successful at establishing the same light hearted fizz and pathos as Four Weddings, it's just that it's hard to accept that Anna Scott, would first, bother with a fellow like this book seller and secondly, that we should feel sorry for film stars.Don't you just love those quotes we sometimes hear about how 'cold we were for a day while we filmed in the snow' or 'how awful it was having to lie in bed for a sex scene for three hours.' On a million dollars a week!The cult of the movie star is emphasised in Notting Hill by having Hugh Grant's family as droll and eccentric as possible. We haven't quite got the gay bachelors of Weddings but there definitely is the roughish, multicolour haired, shrieking girl. And then there's the old girlfriend in the wheelchair. And they're all strugglers and English. Anna Scott is rich and American.But Notting Hill is pleasant enough if you don't mind cliches and most people don't. Roberts is in familiar territory and her strongest asset, her air of vulnerability is allowed full reign. There are enough laughs, or at least smiles, in the film to make it a reasonable buy for an audience.Hugh Grant is his earnest, blinking self and is allowed more credibility than Roberts. After all it would be far more likely for the toad to accept the kiss, than for the Princess to give it.",Null,0,0,6 June 1999
American Pie," Shelter Shed Giggles
","Gross out comedies about fumbly teenage sexual  adventures have a lively and appreciative market judging by the young audience I shared this movie with the other night. But will anyone else find American Pie worthy fare, even taken slice by slice?In Porky's (1981) a pie was pierced by a penis, an event that obviously rendered a significant celluloid scar upon the minds of the makers of American Pie. Fast Times At Ridgemount High (1982) and a larder full of others followed Porky's with similar themes, even if as far as I can remember a pie didn't feature as it does again in American Pie.	And then last year a certain body fluid became a fashion accessory in There's Something About Mary, which is certainly not about teensters having it off for the first time, but is the most striking example of the tendency for extreme vulgarity in teen market films.And yes semen again becomes a plot element in American Pie and yet again it's not placed in its intended receptacle, but is this funny as it is intended to be?Well it depends on whether you are a giggly, embarrassed teenager. The scene is set early in the film when four male friends in their last weeks of high school decide that they have better get laid by the prom. I'll assume that you all know what a prom is. We've all seen enough of these films to know.Anyway there's the sports jock (Oz) who falls for a local chorister (Mena Suvari). There's Jim (Jason Biggs) of pie fame who's dorky dad (Eugene Levy ) steps in to help with porn mags. Kevin reckons that oral sex doesn't really qualify and strange Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) wants to get in on the act but seems the least likely to succeed.Things have moved on in the 1990's. The humour is more extreme and the technology is more zappy. In previous decades lewd photographs might have been distributed. American Pie indulges in The Internet and Sexcam. We can only suppose what might be on offer in these films in the years to come as bandwidth improves with internet development. It's however nice to see that these children are up with the latest toys. Children? Yes the actors don't really look 16 or 17 but the age difference is less glaring than it often is. This subject matter is certainly good grist for the film mill.  Just about every one does have their first sexual experience, which is always at least memorable.But what of the notion of sex as a singular event rather than as an integral part of whole relationships? And what of sex as a commodity, as a service to sell, even if money doesn't specifically change hands?  Sex does sell and American Pie does that notion no harm.But still this film does swing firmly to the notion that relationships can be much more than the sex act and one night stands. It will raise a few smiles, but mainly for those who are still giggling behind the shelter shed.",Null,1,1,20 September 1999
Apocalypse Now," Coppola's masterpiece about madness in the Vietnam War. 42 minutes longer and in some ways even better. 4 And A Half flys out of five
","Apocalypse Now /Redux The reissuing of old films, usually called director's cuts, can amount to a bit of bore really, but Francis Ford Coppola's reedited Apocalypse Now does offer some especially interesting additional material to what was already one of the best films ever made. Coppola allegedly went back to original rushes and reedited the film from go to woe. Of course most of Apocalypse Now was and is an absolute classic; an ode to fearless film making. The bulk of this film could not be improved!This tale tells of Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) traveling by patrol boat up a river in Vietnam during what the Vietnamese called The American War. He's on a mission to assassinate a rogue American master soldier called Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) who's assembled a private army of Montagnard tribes people. But what of Kurtz and what of Willard? How crazy are they and what of their environment? Coppola paints of picture of a world gone absolutely mad, or at least the world run by the American military. Normality is careering about, coloured by death, confusion and catastrophe. Some soldiers like Willard get off on the violence and can't function any more away from it. He's only half a step away from insanity. Others like Kurtz become renegades, and seeing too much fall to despair.Midst this there's the American war, in its latter stages where chaos is foretelling defeat.  A world where a bulletproof cavalry chief (Robert Duvall) forces terrified sailors to go surfing while they are being shelled. A world where the Vietnamese seem to be just targets for helicopter gun ships. So what of this new version of Apocalypse Now? Well it looks terrific with a reworked print which has produced outstanding lush colours.The sound and music of the original which were always absolutely outstanding have been remastered digitally to make them even more impressive. There is an additional playboy bunny sequence which although suitably strange interrupts the flow of the film. And there's an extended sequence with some French civilians which has some value, particularly their account of the politics behind the Dien Bien Phu battle which saw the French colonial forces ousted in 1954 from Vietnam by the Viet Minh led by Ho Chi Minh. There's additional dialogue on the patrol boat and most importantly extra dialogue for Colonel Kurtz which lifts Brando's previously murky performance in the film considerably. This version is 49 minutes longer than the original and at 3 hours 17 minutes could probably do with another edit, but it's still marvelous.4 And A Half Astonished Flys out of five",Null,0,0,4 February 2002
Spider-Man," Goofball Maguire becomes Spider-Man and battles the Green Goblin. Exciting for the most part, good for all the family but includes boring teenage romance bits. 3 And A Half Flys Out Of Five
","Spider-Man scurries about sideways, extending its web for probably half an hour too long. But the web is lustrous at its best.Director Sam Raimi has some impressive credits, mostly from his wonderful Evil Dead films, but he also lays claim to the wonderful A Simple Plan, as well The Cider House Rules. Cider House also starred Spider-Man's lead Tobey Maguire and it would seem that that's a  profitable association. (We'll charitably forget perhaps The Quick And The Dead and The Gift, both of which weren't particularly successful.Tobey Maguire in Spider-Man was an inspired choice as Peter Parker who becomes Spidey. He plays Parker as an affable goofball, a sensitive type who's actually interested in his studies, especially science. I'm not sure Maguire with that twisted little smile could play any other sort of part.Peter gets bitten by a spider and over night grows muscles, throws away his glasses and finds he can match it with the school bully, in what was for me the best scene in the film. If movies exist partly to realise fantasies for the viewer, Spider-Man provided one of the best 'weakling punches back' scenes I can remember. At least for me, that scene was worth seeing the film for, which will amply point to certain facets of my character that I'm sure I would have been better off leaving out of this piece. 
Soon Spider-Man starts swinging about from tall buildings and yes, it was terrific. This was Olympic Gymnastics joined to the best of Circus trapeze. Spider-Man was very quick and athletic. It was exhilarating.The chief baddie in the film is The Green Goblin played very effectively by Willem Dafoe (Platoon, Mississippi Burning, Light Sleeper), although his best bits were probably when it wasn't even Dafoe, as The Goblin zipped about standing on his rocket propelled platform doing dastardly things to Spider-Man's home town.The Goblin was menacing. This was a digitally enhanced threat of course, but so were Spider-Man's feats of valour.There's a love story built into the show between Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) and Peter Parker but it adds little to the film. If Dunst had been asked to play the part a little more darkly then it might have been more interesting, I would have liked to have seen perhaps Katie Holmes in the part.
But Dunst has shown she can do ragged in Crazy/Beautiful and bimbo in Bring It On. I'm sure she played the part just as the producers requested.But that still leaves Spider-Man as alternatively exhilarating and then pretty slow. Perhaps the teenagers will enjoy the teenage romance scenario but I'd say it should have been left from the film. Then Spider-Man would have been just the right length.3 And A Half Webby Flys Out Of FiveSteve Baker",Null,0,0,10 June 2002
Hardball," Rough head white guy coaches little black kids in Chicago baseball. Very effectively made with some tough bits that are well above average. 4 Flys Out Of Five
","In spite of its rather predictable set up Hardball is remarkably effective. It's a terrific example of a mainstream film that squeezes itself sufficiently out of the comfort zone to be both thought provoking and moving without too often lapsing into the triteness we see so often.
Hardball is yet another genre movie about a desperate white guy (Keanu Reeves) forced into coaching a children's sporting team from a rough black neighbourhood. Does he coach a mob of losers to victory? Does he mature while he does the job? Do the children gain valuable insights from their new friend? Does a love interest hover for our desperado coach?
The first third of Hardball shows us Conor O'Neill (Keanu Reeves) in the throws of digging an even deeper hole for himself with bad bets. He's literally on the run from his creditors and is frantic to get one big win to get the ghouls off his back.We've seen that thousands of times before on T.V. and film but Hardball worked the trick beautifully. A baseball bat smashing a hole in a wall, where a head was a few moments before, can be extraordinarily effective cinema if done right. I was sold. O'Neill's gambling mate Ticky, played by character actor John Hawkes, has a bit of Steve Buscemi look about him and that has to be a recommendation. Then we meet the children. The film is set in the notorious Cabrini-Green area of Chicago, a high rise low income housing area which is being progressively torn down. Cabrini-Green is now under redevolopment in what's a bold mixed income experiment, incorporating low/no-income citizens into what an area that was always surrounded by prime real estate.
The children are tough talking 13 year olds, but we're soon shown that they're very frightened. Hardball shows their world as being one where they are rightfully scared to be out after dark. One where people sit on the floor in their high rise for fear of bullets coming in through the windows. Again it was very effective film making.The baseball is little league stuff in every sense of the word. The coach doesn't seem to know much about baseball and his charges, strangely, instantly improve their game on his arrival. There's the designated tear jerking triumphs and I'm sufficiently chump enough to have been sold on that too!The token woman is provided by Diane Lane and she's O.K. but that whole plot line could and probably should have been left out. But Hardball was strong cinematic fare and well worth a look.4 Sporting Flys Out Of Five",Null,12,16,19 June 2002

Saving Private Ryan," New Heights Achieved
","Saving Private Ryan is a terrific cinematic achievement. It's a great combat film, very violent and often relentless, with battle scenes that lift the genre to  new heights. Saving Private Ryan is a classic shoot 'em up film, or should that be shoot 'em off film, one that will always be compared favourably, at least in terms of the fight scenes, to other modern American battle movies like Platoon, Apocalypse Now or The Deer Hunter.A squad of American infantrymen lead by Captain Miller (Tom Hanks), having somehow survived the carnage of the D day landing on Omaha Beach in Northern France, are given the task of  finding Private Ryan (Matt Damon) who's three brothers have all been killed in action in other battles. The Army have decided to try to evacuate the last remaining brother.The squad have reservations about this mission, feeling that risking eight of them just for one private is a bit rich, but off they go searching for this lost paratrooper behind enemy lines in a very hot war. These men are battle hardened except for their translator Corporal Upham (Jeremy Davies) who has yet to fire a gun in anger. Along the way two are killed, raising the stakes considerably. Private Ryan, when and if they find him, had better be worth it.Saving Private Ryan is striking on a number of fronts. Overwhelming realism is forced on the audience in all of the battle scenes beginning with a whole landing craft full of soldiers slaughtered in seconds by machine gun bullets when the door of the craft drops, even before they hit the beach. And that's only the beginning. Throughout the film a hand held camera jerks and ducks with the soldiers as they try to just survive. Limbs and intestines are lost and maimed. The horror and bedlam of war has never been portrayed as graphically.Lots of new cinematic ground is broken. For a start the slaughter by Americans of prisoners of war in the heat of battle becomes justifiable, or at least understandable in this film. I can't remember American soldiers murdering unarmed assailants on film before, not like they do in Saving Private Ryan. I can see now that the viciousness of the situation, the deaths of comrades, makes a mockery of The Geneva Convention when the bullets are flying on a battle field. These things aren't right of course, but they are understandable.As such it's salient that this was a Second World War battle movie. It's hard to imagine this sort of  film being made about American soldiers in Vietnam or Iraq for example. It's still arguable that the yanks were fighting a relatively just war in Europe in response to the invasion of the rest of Europe by Hitler's army but it would be difficult for such claims to be made of many of the U.S.A.'s more recent invasions.Steven Speilberg, the director of Saving Private Ryan, is steeped in the traditions of Hollywood and wasn't slow to use the conventions of the old propaganda post war films. The multi-ethnic mix has been resurrected amongst the squad. The wise cracking Brooklynite (Edward Burns), the Jewish American (Adam Goldberg) the solid middle American Sergeant (Tom Sizemore) and the sharp shooting, (and unfortunately bible quoting) Southern boy (Barry Pepper) are hauled out yet again.Often war films are coming of age movies but Jeremy Davies as the aesthete translator is the only character in Saving Private Ryan who develops and grows, the rest are already established as warriors. Tom Hanks plays the Captain very effectively indeed, with a great deal of restraint, and I would imagine that he will be nominated for yet another Academy Award.The American Flag is unfurled and waved with more than a little enthusiasm in Saving Private Ryan, which is a tad trying for some non Americans, but again this seems irrelevant because Saving Private Ryan is essentially a battle movie, and an exciting one. But of course, the only traitorous individual in sight is a German.Perhaps it's a mistake to expect too much subtlety from Speilberg anyway. Steven Speilberg strengths lie with the visual. He's uncomfortable with character development, conversation and the variance of personalities. Schindler's List, another of his films and the one most likely to be compared with Saving Private Ryan, was devastating for its audience, but that was because of the slaughter, the heartlessness, of the huge massacre that was the holocaust. It was painted with a broad brush on an immense canvas.The same can be said of Saving Private Ryan. We care for the way that some of the characters die but there are just too many of them. This is Spielberg's triumph in Saving Private Ryan and also its weakness. If Spielberg had been able to make us care very much about whether Private Ryan was saved of not, then Saving Private Ryan would have been even more magnificent!",Null,0,1,22 November 1998
Mulholland Drive," Hard to say what this ones about. Confusing but infused with brilliant segments and terrific acting. An awful last half. A David Lynch film. 2 Flys Out Of Five
","It seems that writer/director David Lynch was left with credible but rejected TV footage, added another hour of rubbish and called it the feature film Mulholland Drive.A few will call Mulholland Drive a minor masterpiece. I call it an insult.The first hour is scintillating. We're given a riveting set up. But that descends rapidly into smart Alec twaddle, with characters changing roles, narrative threads completely disrupted and attendant boredom. It is clever, but far too clever for most viewers. Lynch has made his name by pushing film into the very strange. The warped TV noir series Twin Peaks was a well deserved spectacular success. His movies Wild At Heart and Blue Velvet were masterpieces. Lost Highway was, well a little lost but The Straight Story was singularly charming.The first half of Mulholland Drive is amongst the best of Lynch's work. Betty (Australian Naomi Watts) arrives in L.A. to break into acting, staying in her absent Aunties flat. But there she finds Rita who has staggered into the flat unnoticed after being in a rather bizarre road accident.Rita has amnesia so she and Betty try to uncover Rita's past. Meanwhile Betty undertakes a memorable audition and they discover something rather nasty in someone's home. Then Betty becomes someone else and Rita also changes personalities after we're informed at a late night cabaret that everything is an illusion.All that would be fine if Mulholland Drive had kept some sense of continuity but let's concentrate on parts of, rather than the film as a whole.
The discordant, unsettled mood of Lynch's Mulholland Drive world is pervasive. The accompanying industrial noise/music is masterful. The episodes within the film, which would best be described as dream snatches are riveting. Mulholland Drive would have been better served by being presented as perhaps twenty short films. Or more pointedly I would suggest that Lynch should have spent more effort raising the last half of the film to the exalted heights of its beginning. He's certainly talented enough to have done that!The performances are often very strong, most noticeably Naomi Watts and Laura Elena Harring as Rita. But the slow pacing and lack of narrative turn Mulholland Drive into a film only a few will enjoy. And they might just love it.Two Confused Flys Out Of Five.",Null,0,0,14 April 2002
Black Hawk Down," Blow by Blow cinematic account of the debacle in 1993 when the Americans attacked militants in Mogadishu. Overextended, bloody and a little slow. 3 Flys Out Of Five
","Pretty much in the `war is hell' category, Black Hawk Down seeks to outline what it was like for the American troops in Mogadishu Somalia in October 1993, a battle which saw the deaths of 18 Americans, the wounding of 70 Americans and the deaths of about 1000 Somalis. The Americans had been supporting a U.N. sponsored operation aimed at stopping the genocide occurring in Somalia.                The Americans attacked a Somali warlord's stronghold attempting to capture two leaders of a group said to be withholding aid from the starving Somali population. They had been mounting such operations repeatedly over the preceeding months, activities which had left the Mogadishu population unhappy.In the Americans go from their base at the Mogadishu airport into the Bakara Market area, a hornet's nest of militia fighters. The American troops were transported by four lightly armoured Black Hawk helicopters accompanied by an armoured car convoy and support copters. The idea was to nip in quickly late in the afternoon, grab the bad guys and be home for tea. Unfortunately the Somalis were far better organised and armed than the Americans imagined. The Somalis were also overwhelmingly motivated against the Americans. The opposing clan militias amongst the lawless Mogadishu population had united against a common enemy.Black Hawk Down attempts to accurately recreate some aspects of the conflict, concentrating on the fraught situation in which the U.S.A. soldiers found themselves. It became a very bloody and dangerous fight for survival, a battle between a relatively few superiorly armed soldiers against an angry civilian population in a lawless country run by militias.
The Americans got their noses very bruised and the experience has made them even more wary of street battles. Somalia is still a tragically lawless and impoverished area.The film stumbles because of its attempt to be factual. The behind the series generals seem too calm in the context of the film and the story lines tend to blur particularly from a time elapsed point of view. The action seems repetitive but I suppose that getting 1000 people killed one or two at a time takes up some celluloid.The events are bloodied but became distant rather than affecting, but then perhaps Black Hawk Down is less Hollywood than some in the genre. Black Hawk Down certainly suffers much less from the Stars And Stripes patriotism than some movies such as Behind Enemy Lines, but it does drag on a little as an entertainment.

","Yes, as you've probably heard A Bug's Life is heaps more entertaining than its rival Antz.A Bug's Life is themed in a similar way to Antz with a misfit ant saving the colony from threat but Antz is a self conscious Manhattan political whinge whereas A Bug's Life is bright and just funny, in the full Disney tradition. A Bug's Life is a great film to take the children to, or perhaps to even attend by yourself, without having to leave half way through to take the tyke to the toilet or to get the little bugger more popcorn.A Bug's Life was made by the same mob who brought us the amazing Toy Story; amazing from a technical point of view anyway. I'm no expert on animation but it appears that matt, painted backgrounds were often used in A Bug's Life, whereas all of the backgrounds were digitally produced in Toy Story, which must have been hellishly expensive.Antz also has a glossier, more exquisite look to it than A Bug's Life, but we all know that some of the funniest stuff on film has been pretty roughly produced. Remember those great old Chaplin or Keaton films. Technology can't compensate for poor actors or a lousy script. And slapstick will win out more often than more sophisticated humour.Our hero ant in A Bug's Life is a crazy inventor who heads off to bug city to get some help to fight off some stand over grasshoppers. In the tradition of The Seven Samurai or The Magnificent Seven he brings back warriors to help the  folks back home out but he's unfortunately  picked a no hope band of travelling entertainer bugs, thinking that they are the bee's knees at fighting. And yes that is Phyllis Diller's voicing the Queen.Of course the good blokes and sheilas win out, the colony is saved from the grasshoppers and it's a lot of fun along the way. A Bug's Life is inventive, lively and often downright funny. It's a top notch Disney cartoon comedy.",Null,0,0,6 December 1998
Hedwig and the Angry Inch," An East Berlin born transexual heads a rock band in the USA. Innovative with a rock musical feel and featuring memorable animation. 4 Flys Out Of Five

Toy Story 2," Toys Live
","John Lasseter directed the original Toy Story as well as the entertaining A Bug's Life. Toy Story 2 is the best of a very good bunch! These animated films are definitely not just for children. Even if you're never too old to be immature, Toy Story 2 travels well in adult company. It's full of universal themes. We all after all fear rejection. Woody is a cowboy doll who's arm gets damaged and then there's disaster - his young master Andy doesn't take him to the annual cowboy camp! Heartbroken Woody has to face some very difficult home truths. Apart from the fact that he's only ever been played with when Andy felt like it, it's inescapable that Andy will eventually grow up and discard him. He'll be chucked into the bin, thrown away. And he really loves Andy. Or he'll be sold off in a garage sale. This fate awaits all of Andy's toys, and one of them does get put onto the driveway to be sold. Woody goes to the rescue and so begins the main part of the Toy Story 2 adventure. There's also the piquancy of the moments when the toys hear a human coming when they've been getting about on their toy business.They have to scramble to get back into their previous positions so they're not caught out, often flinging themselves into an ungainly heap, looking half broken in a pile. You're meant to feel sorry for these sweet, uncomplicated beings, and it works. If our toys were really alive as we imagined them to be, how would they feel when we dump them?Remember that teddy bear you kept for years as a treasured friend? Where's Teddy now? But all this adds to nothing unless we are treated to superb film making. The best intentions of artists often amount to absolutely nothing, or more often, the mediocre. In fact the film craft of Lasseter's film crew is getting even better. The original Toy Story didn't really hit the mark, it waned a fair bit after the first hour. But this one keeps its power until its conclusion.  Good films require all of their elements to fire. The voicings are terrific, particularly from Tom Hanks as Woody, but a film with a script as vibrant as this one must be a dream for actors. Animation has come a long way as well. Toy Story 1 was remarkable because of its totally digital environment. Never before had the backgrounds been completely computer drawn and they looked great. However the film lacked enough complex (adult) ideas to maintain interest until the end.But bells and whistles do not a good film make. In fact in Toy Story 2 the filming process, this wonderful computer wizardry, almost always recedes to be unnoticed, and that's utterly remarkable.But when it's most important, the digital magic in Toy Story 2 is becomes vibrant. This is when the subtleties of expression on the faces of Woody and his toy mates just couldn't have been bettered with a real human face!And even more so when you start questioning the validity of a supposedly human face in the film and realise later on that it really is only computer generated. We're not that far from having indistinguishable, digital human characters on film. So Toy Story 2 is funny and rather sad. It's a valid and fun exploration of the human condition.",Null,0,0,19 December 1999
Life Is Beautiful," Extraordinary Film
","Every now and then we're treated to a special, warm, challenging film which seems to take us into new territory. Seems to because surely the best art, the best movies, the best stories draw from universal human concerns, basic deep needs; from deeds that seem to be superhuman but are natural extensions of what normal people can achieve through love.We respond strongly to these stories because they are innately understandable; extensions of what is there within all of us - if we are brave or clever enough.Life Is Beautiful has already made its mark as a special movie. It's the first foreign language, subtitled film to be nominated for Best Film at the Academy awards. It has touched the heart of those who have seen it.It has also antagonised some because they feel it makes fun of the holocaust and others because they feel it makes fun of the Nazis, and that's an indication of how close to the bone this film cuts.Even though it's centered around the horror of the Jewish holocaust it's still very funny, especially in its first third and then, incredibly, it ends on a life affirming note, struggling triumphantly out of the depths of tragedy. This is done partly by the softening of a particularly terrible event, but life wouldn't be beautiful in this movie without this concession. If humour is the best medicine then this story is proof.Roberto Benigni, who also directed and co-wrote this movie, gives a virtuoso performance as Guido, the Jewish Dad of a young boy called Joshua (Giorgio Cantarini) who's taken with him to a Nazi concentration camp.All of this would be overwhelmingly depressing if it wasn't for the sheer vitality, humour and love of life Guido shows.  Benigni is a natural clown. His character is the sort of person who would wake every morning, even in a concentration camp, with the affirmation that Life Is Beautiful.The first third of Life Is Beautiful is riotously funny as Guido wins the heart of his chosen woman. We're introduced to a man who is irrepressibly sunny and pretty zany.  He's a trickster and an annoying diversion for those who are more staid. There's barely a hint of the dark underbelly of the film to follow.There have been some very notable films set in pre war Europe. Europa Europa and  Cabaret spring to mind, films where blameless people try to live normal lives in the face of curdling stink of racism which begins to sway normality towards the savage.We are presented with stark reminders in these sorts of movies of what can go wrong when society allows madness to be institutionalized.Life Is Beautiful moves far beyond the horrors of the worst we can offer to our fellow citizens. The very best we can present to our children and each other is the chance to live and above all a love of life. Roberto Begnini gives us a character whose love of humour and sheer vivacity could colour the worst excesses of mankind with warmth.  It's a wonderful example.That Life Is Beautiful could manage to pump us out of misery and fright into the joy of survival is a terrific achievement.",Null,1,2,27 February 1999
The Hurricane," strong
","Rubin Hurricane Carter was in real life an African American who spent nearly half of his life in prison in the U.S. on trumped up charges. He was also, when out of prison, a successful professional fighter. While he was locked up he wrote an impassioned book about his experience; a book that drew liberal activists to his cause and inspired the Dylan hit song `Hurricane'. Denzel Washington plays the part of Carter with convincing passion and with great restraint. There is no doubt that director Norman Jewison has fictionalised the story but that's does not detract from the essential facts and certainly makes for strong drama. For instance Carter married and later divorced the Deborah Unger character after release, there were nine activists not three, and the lawyers had much more to do with the case. The Hurricane won't tell you anything your didn't know already, unless you haven't realised how good an actor Denzel Washington is or perhaps if you were under the illusion that the U.S. judicial system isn't racist. But you will definitely be impressed by a terrific, Oscar nominated performance from the lead actor. On the debit side the last third seems a bit hurried and the whole effort is depressing. Carter in jail in desperation silently crying I'm 50, Get me out!' was as moving a film moment as I've seen. But now I'll repeat if you don't mind some statistics I gathered from Amnesty International regarding death row inmates in the U.S. They were originally presented with my review for The Green Mile. Bearing in mind that we now have an Australian state government calling for the death penalty, not to mention a particularly regrettable, recent Australian death in custody.  There have been 598 recorded executions in the USA, of which 97 were in 1999: 142 by electrocution, 2 by firing squad, 11 by gas chamber, 3 by hanging and 440 by lethal injection. More than 3300 are on death row now in the US. Your colour matters. For example, of the 124 prisoners from Philadelphia on death row as of October 1998, only 15 were white. Rubin Carter must have been luckily not to be in one of the States in the U.S. where they kill their prisoners Texan Governor and the probable next U.S. President George W. Bush has presided over more than 100 of those deaths and no doubt would have had the innocent Rubin Carter executed if given the opportunity.",Null,6,13,21 March 2000
From Hell," Pointless gut dreary tale about Jack The Ripper. Again we are made grateful that we weren't poor in London in the 1880's. Not one of Depp's best. One Fly Out Of Five
","Jack the Ripper murdered 5 prostitutes in ten weeks in 1888 London and like Dracula has entered the realm of legend. Dracula was invented only a few years later in England by an English civil servant called Bram Stoker. England of the late 19th Century would seem to have been a fervent source of nasty tales.                The Whitechapel area of East London at that time was a horribly destitute area with an estimated 1200 prostitutes, gleaned from the hoards of desperately poor women forced to live there by their desperate circumstances. That the murder of only 5 of them would have engendered such interest nearly 100 years later is remarkable, probably one of the first instances of a media frenzy over a serial killer.                It helped of course that the ripper took delight in dissecting his victims, sometimes carefully placing their organs beside the bodies. Those sorts of lurid details tend to grab reader's attention! The Ripper was never found which also adds to the mystery.                From Hell is based on a comic book written by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell. Campbell apparently lives in Paddington Sydney. Moore wrote the famous Watchmen series. Directors Albert and Allen Hughes have previously directed Menace II Society.                From Hell is what is called in the trade richly atmospheric. It's full of gore, rain, prostitutes rutting with their clients up against fences and puzzled policemen. Nearly everyone is either destitute, mad, bad or drugged.                 Johnny Depp plays Abberline, an opium soaked detective who has the ability to suss out crimes by dreaming their details. Robbie Coltrane plays the straight Watson like policeman to Depp's Holmes. He who drags Abberline our of opium dens to do his job. Heather Graham plays Mary Kelly one of the prostitutes and she's the best thing going for the film.                But what's the point! From Hell seems to be something of a gothic film without the Goths, aimed perhaps at a more adult audience, but should they or would they be bothered. This is a slasher film without much in the way of slashes. Depp doesn't help. He plays Abberline so flat he looks like he's sleepwalking. And so will you. Get the comic book. It would probably be better.One Drowsy Fly Out Of Five",Null,2,4,25 February 2002
Eyes Wide Shut," Worth a walk out!!
","Not many films have managed to annoy me as much as Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut!Eyes Wide Shut is painfully slow, badly acted and immature. That's a real shame given that it was directed by the same master film maker who presented Dr Strangelove, 2001: A Space Odyssey and A Clockwork Orange; movies that would have to rate highly in a list of the most innovative and thought provoking.And what of the merchandising? Eyes Wide Shut is yet another recent example of the hard sell of a very soft product, along with Star Bores and Independence Day. It's a movie sold by subterfuge, a lousy film well promoted.Here's the process. The film was made and viewed by the producers. They knew it was a turkey, but knowing that sex sells, billed it as soft (perhaps even hard core) porn starring the saleable Tom and Nicole, and then an added bonus occurred. Kubrick died!The promoters worked the campaign using a few seconds of nude action from the stars, drawing patrons to the cinema with the same techniques used by the rough spruikers employed by Kings Cross strip joints; the same rude ruses used to drag drunk, shallow brained punters off the street to see naked women and 'live' sex.I'm no wowser. Real live sex is great, especially at home, and even at the cinema. I don't mind sex at the cinema as long as they keep it quiet and don't distract me too much from the film, but Eyes Wide Shut attempts to elevate sex, even an orgy, into some sort of stylistic art form.
The sex act, even at its most enjoyable, is also pretty ridiculous. In real life it might be fun but it's hardly dignified. At it's best it's an expression of love or at least a hell of a giggle. As Woody Allen has said 'Sex is dirty. But only if you do it right.'But if ever there was evidence that our culture, and in this case Hollywood, sometimes takes itself far too seriously then consider Eyes Wide Shut.The big thing in Eyes Wide Shut is supposed to be the orgy but what's this? An orgy I would imagine would most likely be accompanied by a lot of alcohol, plenty of laughs and with a bit of luck a good deal of sweat.I especially think it would be unlikely that an orgy would be as depicted in Eyes Wide Shut; as a stately jerk from jerks wearing high heels, masks and bored facial expressions.The so called sex in Kubrick's film is sensationalist Hollywood sex; immature, schoolboy, back of the shelter shed stuff.  I would have hoped this sex wouldn't have had a hope in a hell of a brothel of selling a ticket at the cinema. Alas we're not that smart.Schoolboy? Yes, and as we would expect, very misogynist and homophobic. There's no male nudity but one badly taken accusation of homosexuality against the Tom Cruise character Bill. All of the naked women are skinny and young. Throw in a camp hotel clerk who's played for laughs and we have a very biased world indeed.Most of the above would have been fine though if the film had been at all entertaining. There have after all been plenty of worthy films that have been over promoted, homophobic and sexist, but Eyes Wide Shut is so slow and awkward it's plain boring.It's based on a 1926 Viennese novel unsuccessfully reset to modern New York. Dr Bill Harford and his wife Alice (Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman) go to a rich man's (Sydney Pollack's) party where they are both flirtatious.Later Alice tells Bill that she has fantasies about having sex with someone else. This upsets Bill and he, perhaps for revenge, delves into the seamy, sexy side of New York. Bill meets and old friend Nick (Todd Field) who tells him about these strange orgies and Bill goes to one of them.Apparently it's dangerous for Bill to be at the orgy although it's never really explained why. Bill later tells Alice, with a ludicrous result. End of film (thank God!!)I often think that bad psycho dramas like this could have worked if they were turned into comedies, but in this case I think that Kubrick would have also have had to have got rid of Tom Cruise. Cruise is way out of his depth here.But maybe Kubrick was the real problem because just about everything about Eyes Wide Shut stinks, except the sets which are pleasant.Remember the time travel sequence in 2001: A Space Odyssey? Well Eyes Wide Shut is almost as bad as 2 hours and 40 minutes of that. And I really am sick of seeing women peeing on toilets in movies. We used to see them in the shower in films. Now it's on the throne. Yuk!!",Null,0,0,18 August 1999
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Slippery Garish Black Comedy
","Lock Stock And Two Smoking Barrels is clever, funny and gory with an English brand of the Tarantino Touch. It's well worth a visit.Four Eastenders decide to make it big in a high stakes poker game but end up very quickly owing big money to some nasty characters.The boys decide to indulge in a bit more villainy to try to keep their health, but they're not too good at the bad stuff.  Nethertheless a Shakespearian body count mounts in some of the funniest shootouts since Tarantino's True Romance.There are about three heists going on at once, depending how you count them, and a father's bar is up for grabs, Lock Stock and Barrels. As for the smoking barrels, well two of the weapons used are antique.First time writer director Guy Ritchie has popped up with a slippery, garish black comedy with far more than its fair share of entertainment. Employing some non actors, including a rough edged sportsman (hard playing soccer star Vinnie Jones as Big Chris) and real life crooks (including Lenny McLean as Barry The Baptist) has helped to get that authentic edge no doubt, but a deep understanding of the genre was the real key. Ritchie patently knows how comedy gangster blood baths work.Sting is his usual credible self on screen as JD, Eddie's Dad and Lenny McLean sure knows how real life thugs operate. For a start, it appears that they only say what's necessary. Vinnie Jones as JD is big, quietly spoken, knows the rules of thuggery and is frighteningly ominous.It seems that sportsmen are basically entertainers at the highest level. Another top line soccer star, Eric Cantona, was equally impressive recently in Elizabeth, another top notch English film. The same sorts of influences can probably be said for crooks, who must learn early to hide what they are really thinking - great training for the film stage.Lock Stock And Two Smoking Barrels is refreshing and smart and is a fine independent film. There's nothing really new here, the genre is well established, but the game is played very well indeed. Black humour lovers will find plenty to guffaw at here.",Null,0,0,15 November 1998
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," It's here and it's entertaining especially if you're under 15. 4 Flys Out Of Five
","Harry Potter And The Philosopher's Stone has remained faithful to the book and there are millions who just love J.K Rowling's books about the little boy who is a wizard.	But we should remain mindful of the little boy who said that `I like books more than movies because the pictures are better.' We are also sensible to be a little trepidatious when we approach film adaptations of our favourite books, particularly if the book is as full as the Harry Potter books are of wonderful, vibrant mind images.	So there are some minor disappointments in the film. Hermione is far too earnest, all of the time, and isn't as little girl scruffy as I imagined her. And where was her cat? The great hall I imagined to be larger and in fact the castle that is Hogwarth's school just seemed too small altogether.	Our sighting of Voldemort supping on the Unicorn wasn't as horrifying as I hoped it would be and the centaur looked a little fake but these are mild criticisms and are also in keeping with the rather bland treatment of the more frightening moments from the book.	And I'm sure that that's exactly what the producers and J.K. Rowling were aiming for because Harry Potter And The Philosopher's Stone is above all a very nice, intriguing and imaginative children's movie not especially designed for older viewers. Here is a film aimed at lovers of the book who are also children.	Still there was enough to enliven a good deal of  interest for older viewers.	The Quidditch game enlivened my mental images from the book as did that wonderful Troll, dumb enough to be both dangerous and funny.  Young Ron was a delight as was Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid. Alan Rickman owns the rights to characters you shouldn't trust and Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter mixed just the correct amount of fear, boyish enthusiasm and intelligence into his work.	All of those owls delivering that hail storm of letters was remarkable and the moving stairs were fun, but we'd been let down by seeing them in the shorts.	The film is long, too long for me, but I doubt that a younger lover of the books would agree. But then it could have been much longer if all of the details from the book had been covered. It's just that the books are so richly dense with ideas.	The ghosts had almost no play for example and the guardian portraits were only introduced. I did enjoy the way images moved, were alive, on things like cards and portraits though. That was created more vividly in the film than in the book. Where was that confrontation with dark forces on the train.	But there are at least four more of the these films to be released and no doubt many of these tantalising aspects will be dealt with.	Younger film goers will want to see Harry Potter And The Philosopher's Stone more than once. Older viewers might find it a tad tiresome but still pretty good fun.	4 Hogwarts Flys Out Of Five",Null,0,0,2 December 2001
A Beautiful Mind," Staid and overlong melodrama about a loopy scientist. Very mainstream, but a very good performance from Crowe. 2 Flys Out Of Five
","There's something about the tone of A Beautiful Mind that I found fundamentally annoying. For a film about a smart person it's not too bright. It's certainly not challenging. It's also too slow and at least a half an hour too long at 2 and a quarter hours.The formula is solidly there. Ron Howard's film pushes all of the accepted buttons. That particular music. Those particular sets. The loopy professor. The pretty girl. Sure there's a big significant twist which I won't reveal and Russell Crowe gives a very strong performance, but I can't enjoy these sorts of films too much these days.Still the film will make big money which means that the industry has again been successful at catering to what most people want to see. So go and see it if you like to see what most people want to see.And Russell Crowe, if he can resist pushing the wrong people about, has been served with the sort of role made for awards. He doesn't overdo the overacting as is common when thespians get to play over stimulated types.A Beautiful Mind tells us about a real life character called John Nash who when young came up with some brilliant idea about I've no idea what. Something to do with game theory whatever that is.He's a stuck up malcontent who can't relate at all well with his fellow human beings which apparently dissociated him sufficiently well from common man to give him the wherewithal to figure out how all of us common men and women think as a community. Hmmm.This left him as being some sort of brilliant economic theorist which sounds like a contradiction in terms to me, but probably makes all the more sense for it. Anyway those brighter and better informed than moi decided in real life, years later, after decades of testing, to give the good professor a big prize for his troubles, and troubles he has aplenty (but I won't go into that.)But what of his peers, his fellow professors? The mingy bastards only give our John one flash pen each from the top pocket?But then later Professor Nash gives a nice short speech saying that he couldn't have done any of it except for the love of his wife and that was nice.But A Beautiful Mind would also have been much nicer if it was short like that speech. But then here's another hypothesis that I'm sure you'll agree with. The apparent length  of a film is inversely proportional to how interesting it is.

Ice Age," A mammoth, sloth and saber toothed tiger escort a human baby back to its father in the ice age. Pleasant children's film that will please most adults. 3 Flys Out Of Five
","Ice Age is the latest of the 3D animated features aimed at that magic demographic  the children's movie adults can be dragged along to. Shrek, The Toy Story Double and Monster's Inc. have been huge successes in recent years.  Ice Age will do pretty well.                Ice Age is less sophisticated than the others though, with a story line less likely to excite the intelligence of older viewers.
Still Ice Age has its more cerebral moments. It's set while animals are migrating to beat what looks to be at least pretty harsh winter. Three youngster mammals are playing in a tar pit or mud hole. Their mother tells them to hurry up and join the herd. `You can play extinction later.'In a fun sequence the creatures are walking through an ice cave and enclosed in the walls are the entombed bodies of previously extinct animals. Then we see evidence of alien visitors from millenniums past. The anti evolutionists will be tutt tutting to the max.But the star of the show is a creature you'll see in the shorts for the feature. It's a desperate, jerky squirrel trying  to bury his acorn. He pops up throughout the film and is a fascinating show stopper.Ice Age mainly concerns three animals trying to return a baby human to its species. A wooly mammoth, a sloth and a saber toothed tiger unite in an uneasy alliance and test the odds trying to get baby home.The animation is of course astounding but seems sadly lacking when the humans hove into view. We seem to be able to move a mammoth more realistically than a human. Perhaps the animators haven't put the energy yet into animating people. The Final Fantasy team might be able to give lessons however.Ice Age isn't as entertaining as Shrek or Monsters Inc but its reasonable holiday fare for both children and the oldies.3 Kids Flys Out Of Five",Null,1,1,27 March 2002
The Waterboy," Dumb But Not Funny

The Sixth Sense," Entrancing
","At least three terrific talents have combined to produce The Sixth Sense; a film that captures new cinematic ground, at least in the modern era of film. It occupies something of the same surprising, innovative territory The Usual Suspects challenged a few years ago.	The Sixth Sense tells the story of an eight year old Philadelphia boy (Haley Joel Osment) who believes he can see dead people. A child psychologist called Malcom Crowe (Bruce Willis) takes the case hoping that he can help the boy.	It's a shame that the publicity for the film betrays the boy's secret before we see the film. We aren't told in the film until half way through what is bothering this young fellow. But this would be just about the only criticism I can level at a movie that is a triumph in so many ways, at least for a film from the Hollywood big league.	And the three talents? Well writer/director N. Night Shyamalan has created an entrancing film which is spooky in the pre-special effects fashion. The Sixth Sense doesn't rely on digital monsters but on much subtler techniques. The half glance, the fleeting shadow and at a push the sudden loud noise are layered upon a cleverly worked script and some very effective, sometimes clever camera technique.	Shyamalan (pronounced SHA-mah-lahn and I gather called Night by his mates) is a 29 year old American of Indian extraction who has been entranced with film since his early years. He had produced 45 short films by the age of 16! The Sixth Sense is his third feature film following Praying With Anger in which he also starred, and then Wide Awake in 1997. 	The Sixth Sense will definitely catapult Shyamalan into the top category of directors.	Then for our second on the list there's Haley Joel Osment who in spite of being only 10 years old gives a superb, knowing performance. This is no first flash in the pan effort from Osment. He has been in films and on stage for five years. He was the young Forrest Gump and also played Avery Brown on Murphy Brown. He had a plum role on Ally McBeal for which he was nominated for an Emmy Award.	The third talent would have to be that superb actor Bruce Willis. He again shows that his talents extend far beyond lunging around gun in hand. He years ago played the lead in Sam Shepard's play Fool For Love which ran for five years off Broadway. Consider his almost unrecognisable performance in Die For You and his perplexed cop in The Fifth Element before you write Willis off as some idiot action star. Anyway he was great in Die Hard.	And Australia's Toni Collette (Muriel's Wedding, Lillian's Story, The Pallbearer) nearly made the list for her touching performance as the young boy's mother.	The Sixth Sense somehow avoids the mawkishness of the awful Ghost and is miles ahead of The Haunting, the other ghostly film on show now. The essential trick upon which the film is based remained hidden for me, as it will I think for nearly everyone.	It isn't horrifying but is a bit spooky and thought provoking. It's fine entertainment.",Null,0,0,11 October 1999
A Night at the Roxbury," Three Cheers For Loni
","Will Ferrell and Chris Kattan play the Butabi Brothers who want to get into The Roxbury night club. They're geeks who aren't suave enough to even get into this, the most prestigious club in Los Angleles.Some of what they do is funny and if you've seen the shorts you know exactly what they are but still A Night At The Roxbury has some moments almost worth the price of admission.These brothers are in the groove, even in lifts, even to elevator music and that's impressive.If you don't know who Loni Anderson is (I didn't) she plays herself in the film, asking everyone to admire her new plastic surgery chin and that's groteseque.Dan Hedaya plays their Dad and he's not a police sergeant and that's unusual.Lachlan Munro plays an air head steroid muscle boy with a buck toothed, vacuous grin and that's hilarious.",Null,1,2,23 May 1999
The Truman Show," slick but thin
","The Truman Show You probably know  the basic plot of The Truman Show by now. And  that's probably due to the power of  television advertising. A baby who is called Truman Burbank is nurtured to manhood for thirty years as the subject of a generations long soap, but he is never told that he's a television star. Every one he knows is an actor, including his wife and best friend, who have been contracted to act on a specially constructed set for five thousand hidden cameras. They are all recording the growth and life of Truman Burbank on 24 hour television. The soap, called The Truman Show, is a runaway success making billions for the producers through product endorsements, but runs into problems when Truman starts to realise that something is wrong. He starts to discover the lie. Jim Carrey plays Truman as a bland everyman, as far removed from Ace Ventura or even The Cable Guy as could be imagined, although there are still elements of Carrey's manic characters hidden behind the ordinariness, in particular that peculiar throwing the head back laugh of his. Most comics ache to do drama, serious acting, and Carrey has enough clout and money now to throw in the odd comparatively straight movie. This one is still a bit twisted though. He's blessed in The Truman Show by having Aussie Peter Weir in charge, a thoughtful director with an amazingly impressive C.V. including Witness, The Year  Of Living Dangerously,  Fearless, Dead Poet's Society, Mosquito Coast, The Cars That Ate Paris and Picnic At Hanging Rock. Weir with The Truman Show has concocted a very steady, pensive film, which is a comment on the processes, evilness and effects of live television. The Truman Show is thought provoking because it seems feasible. We could believe that a television corporation would invest the millions it would have taken to create The Truman Show, buy itself a baby lead actor and then deceive that child for decades for the entertainment of the masses. We can also believe, I think, that it's possible that the viewing public, and a government, could have sanctioned such a process, arguing no doubt that since the child/adult is living an idyllic (suburban) life style, then what harm could possibly have been done. And anyway 'let's entertain the public, give 'em what they want'. The public, the audience of The Truman Show love it. They avidly watch this soap during the intervals in  their own lives, in Truman Show Bars and I can imagine them living Truman's life with him in their own toilets, on buses and  in post offices and banks (if there still is such a thing in this future as a post office and a bank!) Such an audience would hate to miss a thing. After all it is often easier to confront someone else's problems and life choices rather than your own. Then there are the deceptions themselves. Just how fanciful are the scenarios suggested by this movie? A subplot of The Truman Show involves an actress (played by Natascha McElhone ) who gains a conscience and tries to tell Burbank about the lie that is his whole life. But what about the others? In particular his best friend played by Noah Emmerich and also his wife (Laura Linney), who seems to be in a particularly invidious moral position. Is this how low mass entertainment might stoop.? Can we expect worse in the future? Have we already seen worse? The Clinton affair, the Di soapy and most of the Oprah stuff is pretty weird already. And what about the audience, the consumers of Burbank Truman's life? They cheer Truman on when he rushes to escape but you'd bet that they would demand a replacement quick smart; a dream filler from TV land. How could the addicts of a show like The Truman Show live without another shallow dream to take its place? The Truman Show puts interesting questions to us all and is a strongly realised social comment from one of our fabulous Aussie directors. Nothing new is suggested really, except for the scale of the deception in The Truman Show but Peter Weir does create his film world with great precision and believability. Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers was on a similar theme and even The Simpsons has had a good go at sensationalist TV in that famous episode where Homer gets into trouble for allegedly pinching  his baby sitter's bum, (for those who might be interested!) The Truman Show takes two hours to tell us little we didn't know already and for all of its superior qualities seems a little thin.  I would have liked to have followed Truman Burbank out into the real world, perhaps along the lines of Bad Boy Bubby, but The Truman Show still has me thinking, and that's an achievement these days.",Null,0,0,28 September 1998
Hart's War," Fairly inticate P.O.W. film which becomes a court room drama. Lacks dramatic intensity. 3 Flys Out Of Five
","Bruce Willis is back at the cinema, or is he? In Hart's War he plays the American commander in a German concentration camp near the end of WW2, but Willis seems to be holding back, reserved, muted. He's not even the central character.Compared to say The Great Escape which would have to be the benchmark in the movie realm, Hart's War lacks dramatic punch. But it has virtues. Hart is played by Dubliner Colin Farrell. He's a soft soldier, doing his duty as an officer's offsider, driving big brass about protected by the influence of his well to do family. He gets captured, in a scene that is truly dramatic, interrogated and sent to Stalag VI in very wintry Belgium.Willis's character Col. McNamara, a fourth generation soldier, is suspicious of Hart because Hart emerged from interrogation far too early. Hart might have spilt the beans and McNamara places Hart into an enlisted men's hut.Hart is soon joined there by Scott (Terence Howard) and Archer (Vicellous Shannon), two black American pilots and here's where the major plot element develops because the white American troops led by Bedford (Cole Hauser) react viciously towards black men being put amongst them.It's not long before a rather improbable court martial is on for us, with a black man being tried by a hanging judge (McNamara) for murder. The German commander (Marcel Iures) plays his stereotype well, as do the rest.The racist element is handled forcefully along with a rather intricate plot. There's plenty to think about as various relationships are developed.What Hart's War lacks is dramatic flourish. We're in a dangerous prison with the men but we don't feel threatened. If fact the prison with its theatre, piano, football, B.B.C radio and trombone looks more like a very chilly holiday camp. I wouldn't have been surprised if there was hot running water.Colin Farrell's character Hart, the center of the film in spite of Willis's top billing, handles his material well but it seemed he should have been back in The States at his posh law school, of that he really had never left.We get glimpses of Jewish detainees on death trains, but it doesn't quite register as awful. We've seen it all before and it doesn't stir the Hart. Hart's War fell into that dangerous hole called the court room drama but even the court seemed vacuous. Except for the racist element we'd seen it all before.3 Flaccid Flys Out Of Five",Null,2,3,3 June 2002
Cube," Great Set but melodramatic
","This low cost, Sci fi, high tech, lowly acted, Canadian psychological and mathematical thriller with a great set, offers plenty from the shorts for the slice and dice fans. The film begins with a fellow stepping into a room and being literally sliced by razor wire into cubes, sliced and diced. Horror fans will like the look of that! But Cube will leave you wondering.Wondering what? A group of Canadians wake up in a deadly prison which consists of a series of cubes with a door in the middle of each of the six walls. There are strange metallic rumblings every few minutes and certain death waits if they do nothing.Step through the wrong door and they're likely to die a horrible if quick death.  But step through doors they must or they will die from thirst. Or much worse, they will have to suffer from being stuck with the others, none of whom you would pick to retire with to a tropical island. But why are they there in the first place? Kafka's monstrous bug and Orwell's 1984 springs to mind.Cube is full of desperate musings on who would have built this monstrous prison. 'Only the government could have built something this ugly' is a memorable line. But don't look for anything too thoughtful in Cube even if getting out of the maze eventually becomes a mathematical puzzle, which progressively becomes ethereal enough to isolate the drama even further from most movie goers.And even my poor maths could pick holes in the numbers. It doesn't take much math to know that an even number can never be prime, but suddenly producing a Rain Man style autistic savant was a bit rich!The film is left  to hinge only on its set which is strong but the rest, the most important bits, the characters, have been dealt with very poorly. Who cares who survives?This sort of psychological drama is a classic Hitchcock, marooned in a lifeboat scenario. Claustrophobia, isolation and fear is a terrific recipe for drama but then it's handy if there are characters with depth, a director with ability and actors who can act. I suspect that Alfred would have made much more of his characters if he had got hold of this script.The doctor, the criminal, the bureaucrat, the student, the cop and assorted others are ineffectively handled. They never rise beyond being shadows of personalities and the drama becomes progressively melodramatic.Why were they put in the cube? Perhaps they deserved it. After a while we would wonder if any of them are worth saving anyway, especially if they live in a community that would build such a thing as the Cube. But hey, that's just nasty. (The Cube became pretty boring at times, encouraging those sorts of ideas. )But still Cube is memorable, if only for the total set, the total cube when it is finally revealed. It's just a shame that you are never encouraged to become caring about the characters.And then there's the ending, which is a total cop out unless you believe that there is no meaning, for anything. Then you will leave the theatre suitably perplexed.",Null,2,8,31 May 1999
Tarzan," Nappies?
","The gorillas in the Melbourne Zoo are especially impressive. They live in what appears to be an extensive and hopefully expansive area where perhaps they are fairly happy.They're segregated not only from the humans visitors who rightly ogle at them but also to a large extent from each other. I gather that gorillas can be pretty aggressive towards each other in zoos. Homicide (gorillacide?) is a strong possibility in these confined spaces.How they might behave in the wild (if these unfortunate creatures can find enough country to be wild in) is beyond this city slicker's knowledge, but I'd bet that if one found a baby in a tree house it would either leave it, throw it, break it or eat it.And I'm absolutely certain that nappies (diapers) or loin cloths wouldn't be on Mrs Gorilla's shopping list.But I'm being churlish I suppose. After all this is Walt Disneyland.Edgar Rice Burroughs created the Tarzan character as a short story in 1912 and went on to write 24 novels starring the ape man. Burroughs wasn't interested in veracity, and wasn't the type, Gorillas In the Mist style, to muck in with the apes to get the inside story, backgrounding, indulging in adventurous  investigative field trips to Africa to check out the locals and their relationship with the local Gorillas.But he knew how to tell a good tale which later blossomed into the TV series starring Johnny Weissmuller howling through the upper branches with his good mate Jane. That Jane was a white lass was necessary if unlikely considering that Tarzan lived with apes in Africa. But then as now, it would be commercially unwise to mix races.Come to think of it, The Phantom who also lived in darkest Africa, also took up with a foreign, fair skinned, female interloper.This latest version of Tarzan is equally strange from an anthropologic point of view but what the heck. It's an impure world.The science of animation continues to progress and amaze. Using a technique the Disney boffins call deep canvas (zappy eh!), they have the characters zipping around and about the jungle with great three dimensional abandon.The plot is dynamic and reasonably coherent and the voicing by in particular Minnie Driver as Jane is attractive. Lance Henrickson as Kerchak the boss ape, Glenn Close as Mum, Rosie O'Donnell as Terk one of the ape sidekicks and Tony Goldwyn as Tarzan are competent.Tarzan is entertaining for everyone. It isn't in The Lion King's class but don't send in the ankle biters on their own. Do the good adult  thing and slip in to enjoy a film that is entertaining for children of all ages.",Null,0,0,27 September 1999
The Thin Red Line," Terrific and Tense
","It didn't take long for a better film, a more effective film, than Saving Private Ryan to come along!Terrence Malick's The Thin Red Line is a flawed yet superb war movie; without those annoying Hollywood American Flags waving and one where you do care about the characters. After all, who among audiences really gave a damn about Private Ryan? That was the problem with Spielberg's film.We often don't even learn who the Private Ryans in The Thin Red Line are before they die, but it still seems to matter a lot more. The soldiers in The Thin Red Line are to a large extent anonymous, grimy and nameless, but they're human. They're us.The Unknown Soldier is after all a most powerful image, because he or she could be any one of us. But to have this perspective we need to be encouraged to focus beyond the bullets and the blood, the screams of terror and pain and this is what Malick has achieved. And that's in spite of absolutely riveting battle scenes.The Thin Red Line was filmed in The Port Douglas area near Cairns and this area is painted very prettily indeed. This is a small problem for locals in the early section of the film because it's hard to accept that the movie is set in Guadalcanal instead of North Queensland. Guadalcanal was the site of a vicious battle between the Japanese and the Americans which occurred a year after Pearl Harbour.Malick muses beyond the conflict though, often deadening the sounds, swinging the camera away from the terror in a man's eyes onto the beauty of nature; a passing beautiful butterfly. Or he'll have a soldier in the midst of carnage, nose in the dirt, hiding from death, concentrating on the way dew or blood drips down grass stalks. And that's what must have happened. And that seems much more important than the bullets ricocheting by, as long as the bullets miss.We can easily see the point. This is Malick's preoccupation. Why kill? Why fight? Why why, when our Earth (and our North Queensland) is so beautiful. Basic stuff, but we humans so often miss the point don't we.The film has a big name cast although some like John Travolta and George Clooney are only on screen for a few moments. Travolta is important though playing a hateful Captain, pulling rank on an older, smarting Lt Colonel Tall (Nick Nolte) setting up Nolte's character beautifully. Tall's a career soldier who is willing to sacrifice men for his own advancement and glory within the army.But there's little else in The Thin Red Line in the way of rounded characters. The soldiers are only trying to survive, and win (stop) the battle. Soldiers in the film begin to assert their individuality and then often Malick drops them. Sometimes he has them killed.There are relationships that mean little in the context of the movie and they should have been cut. Sean Penn although interesting could have been left out altogether. The film needs to be half an hour shorter, and that's its only fault.But still The Thin Red Line is a terrific film. Malick is a thoughtful director. He adds voice overs and asides about how stupid the battle process is even though it's doubtful that any of these soldiers would have had the time or the inclination to muse on the human condition. It's an unusual tactic by a director but effective.He often shifts the view away  from the obvious and that gets us thinking. War sometimes must be like that. Extreme fear will cause the brain to disengage; to self protect; to shut down sensory input. The Thin Red Line emphases this and also the opposite. It's an exciting, tense war film that is also philosophical. Don't miss it.",Null,1,2,7 February 1999
Rock Star," Big name Metal Band adopts new lead singer. So you want to be a rock star? Juvenile with mediocre music. 1 Fly out of Five
","Isn't Metal music about real noise, rebellion and anarchy? Are the makers of Rock Star really trying to tell us that cynical corporatism rules even in the Metal world? Is this a film only aimed at tut tutting, middle aged, failed musos, turned film execs, who are trying to make a buck out of stupid metal heads who'll watch anything as long as a few distorted guitars and Jennifer Aniston are on show?And do these film producers really believe that we the viewing public are as dumbed down as they are, or at least would like us all to be?Who's going to see Rock Star. Judas Priest Fans? One or two at a stretch I'd say. Judas Priest, unless they're the big headed, manipulative, shallow b*****ds they're portrayed to be in this film, also wouldn't go. They'll no doubt send their lawyers but that's another story.And what of Mark Wahlberg as Chris Cole, who's obviously meant to be Tim `Ripper' Owens. Owens was a devoted fan and a member of a Judas Priest tribute band who in 1997 replaced Rob Halford as Priest's lead singer.Cole in Rock Star pulls the same trick but is Wahlberg the actor really interested in anything Wahlberg does? Two generations ago we might have called him an existentialist. Mark Wahlberg could have walked straight out of Catcher In The Rye if he could have cared. Remember Val Kilmer in The Doors? Now that man was involved. There was a real rock star. Wahlberg as a Metal Man, no way!Still the orgy scene was pretty good fun and I am a sucker for stage fright. That scene where the new lead singer fronts that huge stadium crowd was a fine moment. But the bliss only lasted 60 Seconds.One Wimpy Fly Out of Five",Null,1,2,19 November 2001
