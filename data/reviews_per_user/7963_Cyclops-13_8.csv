Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It was okay
","The movie was okay although the whole fight scene with Darth Maul made the movie.  I was one of the people who saw the movie on the first day, 12:01AM showing.  Although I will say this much, unlike some people who stayed in line all day, I stood in line for about fifteen minutes, was told that the movie sold out, then told that there was a drawing being held, lost the drawing, then had my Mother go up to the lady passing out winning tickets and had her ask for two tickets in which the lady said okay.  And I am happy this I got in that way because I would have been upset having waited for so long and paid money for that.Don't get me wrong, but I was not to happy with the movie itself.  It seemed rushed and the plot didn't work for me.  They spent too much time focusing on Jar Jar Binks and his dopey running and falling down bit, and not enough on the story and the characters.  I wanted to know more about Darth Maul, let's get more information about why the blockade was surrounding the planet, lets focus more about Darth Sideous and how he it into the grand scheme(as if most of us don't know, but I still think it would be good to have that in the movie) what about the relationship between the Gungan's (did I spell that right?) and the Naboo, why are they enemies, and if they are not enemies, why are they separated like that.  Those are things that could have been focused on, not Jar Jar sticking his tounge out at everyone. What about Anikin, why not focus on his fears, why is he so angry, we need that for the back story for Darth Vader's birth.  Give us just a little more information on the corruption in the Senate.  What about the head of the Senate, why is he corrupt?  These are things that needed to be focused on. Sword fights, battles and special effects don't make the movie.  The space battle should have been just a little bit more intense at least focusing in a little on the pilots and seeing a few of them get killed and shoot down some of the enemy fighters and throw out some flight lingo.  That's what made the space fights so cool in the previous movie.We take a look at some of the earlier movies and you got to see the emotional feelings the major characters had.  We got to see Luke Skywalker's life, how he wanted more but was being held back.  He wanted a life of adventure whereas  his uncle wanted  him on the farm.  We see Han Solo as the selfish smuggler who only worries about two things, himself and money. But you also saw another part in him, the brave side, risking his life by running down the Stormtroopers while Skywalker and the Princess made their escape.  We get the impression that Princess Leia is a very strong person who is also a very high ranking person in the rebellion.  We learn things about the characters along the way.  Solo's debt with Jaba the Hut. Princess Leia cover as diplomat being blown, her home planet being destroyed.  We find she is a very determined woman who will not betray her friends even under torture.  We really don't learn too much about C-3P0, R2-D2 and Chewbacca untill the next movie and as for Darth Vader, we can see that this is the man.  Don't mess with him, he is very powerful.  You learn about Obi Wan Kinobi and how he trained Luke's Father and fought with him during the wars and get a glimse of what happened to Luke's Father.In the next movie, Lando Calressian appears, and even though he isn't in the movie very long, we learn a little about him.  We know he is a friend of Han Solo, the Millenium Falcon was his, he is an expert con artist and won control of Cloud City through a gambling debt.   We know enough that he has lead an adventurous life and that he is a very brave person.  Lando is one of the few characters to ever confront Vader with a verbal assault and one of the few people who double cross Vader when the deal goes sour to rescue his friends.  Boba Fett arrives.  Not much is given on his character, but the man is good and we can see he is very clever.  Admiral Piett enters into the movie and we see him go from a regular command officer to the commanding officer, a promotion that causes him serious emotional problems due to fear of failing Vader.This was character development.  These characters were well developed from the start even though they did not have much screen time.  The characters in this movie seem to just appear.  We know little of the history of Qui Gon Jin except that he has had problems inside the Jedi Counsil.  Obi Wan is just a pupil, Anikin is upset about being a slave, and as for the Queen, we know that she is strong individual who can take charge.  But nothing above that.  There are other important characters who jump in and that's it. Captain Panaka is just there as the body guard, Ric Ollie is there as a fighter pilot.  We have Senator Palpatine who gets control of the Senate about the end of the movie.  What about Boss Nass.  What about the Queen's body guard.  What about Anikin's Mother.  There needed to be more development of some of these characters and more storyline around all the cast members and especially more around the real major characters.  Let's pull them out a little and make them characters, not people on screen reading lines.Star Wars: The Phantom Menace was okay, but it needed a lot of work.  This will be my least favorite episode so far.  I hope things get better because I really want to enjoy this series.  By the way, I think I miss spelled some of the names on this review.  If I did, I'm sorry.",6,0,1,6 September 2000
Armageddon," Jerry Bruckheimer Rules!
","This film is your basic Jerry Bruckheimer movie.  It has the action, the humor and the personality that you would expect from his movies.  And with the direction of Michael Bay, that makes for an extra bonus.Bruce Willis is in excellent form as the tough father and I loved the scene where he is chasing his daughter's boyfriend around the oil rig.Special effects were great and the dialogue is good.  I can't say much from the scientific point of view, but from the point of view of sheer fun, this movie rates high.  I would say the only negative thing there is to say about the movie is the fact that it is very long.  Outside of that, if you like Jerry Bruckheimer, then I recommend you see this movie.",Null,1,2,7 September 2000
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Robert Patrick Ruled The Film
","I only saw this movie so many times because I loved watching Robert Patrick play the T-1000 Terminator.  I enjoyed watching him play the relentless hunter.  He played it so real I thought that he really seemed like he was a heartless liquid metal robot that could kill indiscriminatly.Everything else was okay.  Special Effects were great.  And I can still see Arnold as that robot.  Everytime I see him in a film I keep waiting to hear him say 'I need your clothes, your boots and your motorcycle.'  or something to that effect.",7,0,0,1 September 2000
Independence Day," I just don't know.
","If any of you have read my review on Battlefield Earth, you'll understand why I can get behind this film.  At least this movie had some action that was pretty good.But at the same time, I felt the way some of you did.  I especially agree with the review by Roddy-15, which is a few reviews down from mine, this movie was nothing more than stereotypical characters and the patriot, gung-ho, America the beautiful stuff that really makes me sick.  How come just the Americans can come up with the ideals?  Why not the Russians, the Chinese, the Africans?  Why the Americans?Why do all the black characters always have to be the ones who have all the slick one liners?  I get so sick of that.  I think Bill Pullman was to young to play the president, I think some one older should have played the part. Michael Keaton maybe, or Kurt Russell.  Maybe even Morgan Freeman.  But he might be a little to old to jump into a fighter jet.  I don't know.I did like the acting by most of the actors although Judd Hirsh did get on my nerves playing the old man with little bits of wisdom to spread here and there.  Of course I'm not a real big Hirsh fan.  Come to think about it, I didn't like any of the cast members from Taxi except Danny DeVito and Christopher Lloyd.  But back to the ID4.  It was an interesting movie I'll say that much.Despite the impossibility of the plot, character development and overall feel of the movie (I just don't think things would be that calm if aliens really did land) I still give it a decent rating, 5 out of 10.  But you have to remember that I have recently watched this movie after seeing Battlefield Earth, the most awful movie made in 2000, so my view on ID4 may be a little warped.  But like I said in the summary, I just don't know.",Null,0,1,1 September 2000
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," I think I'm going to kill myself.
","ï»¿Unlike the first movie, I did my homework on this movie and I read the book first.  After reading the book, I couldn't wait to see Ian Malcolm return and I couldn't wait to see the other characters in the book come to life on the big screen.  Little did I know.*SPOILIERS*  Not that it would matter to me.The only thing that remotely connects this movie to the book is the fact that it has the same title, Ian Malcolm, Sarah Harding and Eddie Carr and it takes place on a different island with dinosaurs.  I was highly upset.  Then they put that punk old man back in the movie and I still wanted him to die.Here is my main problem with the movie.  The InGen company has been reorganized with new directors and executive officers.  They want to take the dinosaurs off the island and bring them to the new Jurassic Park in San Diego.  Now, they created the dinosaurs, so what was the problem if they wanted to take the animals off the island and bring them to America? They belong to the company.So up pops along Vince Vaughn who is a Major League (you fill in the blank) and he decides to take it upon himself to liberate the dinosaurs.  So he ralleys up the troops and he feels like freakin Moses walking around the camp with his chain cutters, breaking the bonds of the dinosaurs who then wreck the camp and kill innocent people.  Then, after stumbling on the baby T-Rex, he brings it to the camp to have it's leg fixed.  But didn't somebody think that maybe mommy and daddy T-Rex had their own medical plans and didn't like humans messing with their child.  So Ma and Pa Rex come through and wreck their base and kills one of their men in the process.  All this so little Vince could play liberator.  If you really think about it, he the one at fault for everything that happens in the movie.  And it makes me so mad during the scene when he takes the bullets out of the man's gun and then the dude can't kill the T-Rex that is trying to kill him and his men.  And what makes it worse is the fact that he is regarded as the hero in the movie. That was stupid.I like Jeff Goldblum, but he stutters his way through this movie as if he is just reading lines. Julianne Moore's character made me upset in the movie because I thought she was stupid shouting orders to people who don't even belong to her group.  If I were the Marlboro men in that movie, the second she told me that we have to move now, that would have been the second I'd tie her narrow behind up on the nearest tree, cut open a vein and let her hang with the rest of the meat.  Her and her boyfriend Vince.  (As you can see I have nothing but hate for her.  Just wait until I review the Fugitive.)My suggestions to Steven is that you focus more on the book and stick with that and keep the Earth First concept out of the movie because that's what hung it for me. Not that I'm against protecting the environment and animals, but what happened in this movie was too much and too ridiculous.  And you have no right taking such liberties as you did in changing the storyline. All and all, I hate this movie.  If it was more like the book, I could have handled it, but unfortunately, this is what I am forced to deal with. My suggestion for you the audience is to stay away from this movie and watch the first one.  It was so much better.",Null,0,0,7 September 2000
Mission: Impossible II," Best action movie of 2000
","This was the best action movie made in the year 2000.  The action was great from start to finish.  The movie does slow down briefly during the initial meeting with Cruise and Newton, but once the team is assembled, this movie rocks.  Much better than Woo's other films such as Broken Arrow and the Replacement Killers and ten times as better than the first one although it was great also.Mission Impossible 2 also shows that you can do action packed movies at the PG-13 level and not have all of the graphic violence, language and sex that most current movies do.  If your looking for a movie with the ultimate cliff hanger (literally) and thrill ride action, you need to see M:I2.",10,1,2,14 August 2000
The Matrix," I liked it but............
","ï»¿ *MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*When I popped in the rental store and finally decided to rent this movie, I really didn't know what to expect because I'm like, this is Keanu Reeves we're talking here. But as I was watching the movie, I really began to enjoy it and once the movie ended, I said, 'I liked it.'  But, I did have some problems with the movie.For one, everything was made to be mysterious.  Why did everything have to be a big mystery and the sky blackened, and the thunder and lightning.  Fishburne almost spoke in circles the entire movie.  Neo would ask what is the matrix, and Morpheus would say something like, 'The matrix is what the matrix is not.'  And I'm like WHAT!?!?!?!?!??!  In my opinion, all he had to do was tell Neo, this is what the situation is, and we need  your help because you are the one who has the power to change everything.  Instead, we the audience are forced to sit through dialogue of double talk and misdirected answers in an attempt to make Neo think.  And what is the story with the Oracle?  Were are in a computer, how is she able to make predictions about the real world inside a computer?Where did the humans get the equipment to make the vehicles that they transported themselves in?  They seemed awful high tech for people from the mind set of the twentieth century to come up with?During the shoot out scene, how is it that they were able to move so fast to dodge bullets but when the agents shoot at them, it suddenly seems to be a problem to dodge them.  RE:  the scene where Neo first dodges the Agents bullets and Trinity remarks on how he moved so fast.  She moved pretty fast to dodge all of those bullets and do a flip during the SWAT Team shoot out and at the beginning of the movie where she was able to run along the sides of the walls.  And as far as I'm concerned, the bullets in the gun of the SWAT Team members are faster than the one coming from the gun of the Agent.  And there are more bullets to dodge because there are more people shooting at you.And this question, I understand that since your mind is plugged into a computer your liable go brain dead if you are pulled out to quick.  I don't really buy it but I'll go with it, but why is it that if you get shot, you die, or if you fall off a building, you die?  If we know that this is fake and with our mind we can do some outrageous stuff like move faster than bullets and jump over huge gorges and bend objects at a thought, then why can't we just say, this isn't real.  When I'm hit with a bullet or with a car or I hit the ground from a one hundred story drop, I should be able to say this really didn't happen.  I'm Superman.  Where's my Kryptonite?  I hardly felt that punch by the Agent.And here is my final thought.  By the end of the movie Neo has reached his full capacity.  So why do we need sequels to the movie.  I can understand a second one to show us getting out of the matrix, but why a third one?  I don't know, maybe the have this all planned out.  Maybe Neo has what it takes but he isn't quite a Jedi yet.Now here is what I liked about the movie.The special effects were great and the fight sequences were outstanding. The way they had them fight, I thought the actors really studied martial arts years and were really fighting, except for the obvious scenes when they would jump in the air and do kicks and when Keanu would do the back flips.  Those are what really kept me into the film, but that isn't always enough.  In the case of this movie though I think this was the exception where the special effects is one of the things that kept me into the movie, although I did like the basic storyline which I think helped keep me in the mood for the movie.I liked Carrie-Ann Moss' character and her interaction with Neo and I really like Joe Pantoliano in almost anything ever since I saw him in The Fugitive.  Larry Fishburne was in great form as usually.  I liked the interaction between Neo and Agent Smith and I got a kick out of how slow he spoke although sometimes it was over the top, but I loved it anyway.In a nutshell, I liked the movie.  It had some elements to it that was kind of like, what?  But at the same time it had a decent storyline that most people sometimes wonder, what is real and what isn't and you can use your mind to accomplish anything type story.  It was kind of like the movie Dark City in the sense that one man will make a difference and stop the unbeatable bad guy(s).  I recommend watching this movie on a Saturday night with friends or if you just want something to watch by yourself when you order a pizza.  That's what I do.",9,0,0,7 September 2000
Jurassic Park," Read the book. Loved the movie.
","I am forced to think back to when my friend called me up and said, you have got to see this movie.  I agreed and we went and saw it that day.  I'm sitting in the theater waiting for the movie to start and I'm thinking about the preview I partially and thinking, yeah, I can go for a comedy. Little did I know.  Once the movie went black and the trailers ended, I heard this loud THUMP! The music of the movie had begun and it sent a chill up my spine and I said to myself, I have the feeling this isn't going to be a funny movie.  And I was right.This was a good movie.  I wasn't prepared for the technological piece of work I was about to feast upon.  I really enjoyed the action scenes and the part at the end where they are trying to escape from the velociraptors was great and intense making me wonder how were they going to get out, although if that was me I would be packing multiple guns and ammunition.  I would have looked like Issac Hayes from I'M GONNA GET YOU SUCKA, during the scene where they are getting ready to take down Mister Big and he has all those weapons strapped to his body.Anyway back to the Jurassic.  The movie was so great, that this was the first movie that I saw more than four times, seeing it a total of eight times which back then was a lot for me since I didn't have my own car at the time.  The record being beaten in recent times by the movie TOMORROW NEVER DIES (9) and THE X-FILES: FIGHT THE FUTURE (10).After seeing the movie, I decided to read the book.  And I'll say this much, if I had read the book before, I would have been upset about the fact that the old man didn't die because I really hated him, but outside of that, I think I wouldn't have minded to much with the obvious changes except for the fact that I really liked Muldoon and didn't want to see him die.All in all, this was a good movie and I recommend watching this any day of the week you want to watch something with excitement and dinosaurs.",Null,0,0,7 September 2000
