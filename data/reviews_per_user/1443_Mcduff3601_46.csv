Gremlins," Still a little creepy after all these years
","Just rewatched this one for the first time in decades. The special effects are dated, the comedy feels old, the acting is meh. But I still like this one. It brings me back to my childhood. I watched this recently because it was on someone's Christmas watch list but I didn't really get a Christmas vibe, even though it was every where and they talk about it being Christmas.This one borders on a horror, you see gremlins meeting their demise in all sorts of gruesome ways. They are cannon fodder. I won't rewatch this again soon as it wasn't that great and someone who is younger and used to better special effects probably won't like this movie but it holds a lot of nostalgia for me.",7,0,1,5 December 2018
The Equalizer," great action movie and an excellent omage to the 80's show
","I love this movie. This is an action movie done right - at least for me that is. I find the pace, the character development all of it is right on track. It's not perfect by any means but I just LOVE watching bullies get whats coming to them and this movie delivers! I liked how Denzel's character has got OCD and is meticulous kind of explaining his odd way of calculating how he is going to do the things he does.There are no real surprises or twists here, we are introduced to the characters, told who is good and who is bad after that there is no explaining needed that the bad guys need a good ass kicking. Thats all this movie is, watching good guys fight bad guys. The way it's done though works for me, the music, setting, style and pace all make it an excellent movie that I think is worth watching again and again.",10,0,2,25 June 2018
Deepwater Horizon," Excellent action/suspense movie but....
","I can't speak to how realistic this movie is I don't know the details. This was a real event and people lost their lives. But for the conversations and details within the movie I am not sure how accurate it is but it doesn't matter if you want a good fast paced tense movie this is a good one. I have mixed feelings about it, the movie focuses on the oil rig workers and really focuses on putting the blame on the BP execs and basically saying they forced us into this situation. Which might be how it happened.They show the real folks at the end of the movie so I am sure you can dig into the actual facts and I know BP was sued or fined billions of dollars over this. It was interesting to see the life on an oil rig and show just how scary things can get if things go wrong.There are lots of scenes of people getting hurt or killed so if you are sensitive to that don't watch. Otherwise its a solid movie and great acting from Mark and Kurt.",7,1,1,12 March 2020
Dawn of the Dead," I am not a huge fan of horror, Zombie or gory movies...but
","This movie does it all right. It is fast paced, develops it's characters just enough that gets you invested into their survival. The slower scenes help build the tension and then the action hits. There were a few shots zoomed out to show the carnage that was happening all around our characters it added to the whole mood of the movie and made you question what is happening not to mention the realization that there must be millions of other stories happening to other people in this movies universe.I am not a big fan of gore, I tend to avoid it where possible. I also tend to not watch bleak movies (looking at you THE ROAD) since I find they stick with me for a long time and I don't care for that, no sir not one bit. I make exception for this movie because it plays out more like an action movie then a horror and I likes me some good slposions and shooting.",7,4,6,15 October 2018
Last Flag Flying," Very slow paced movie that just didn't melt my cold frozen heart
","I know what this movie was going for but it just didn't quite make it there for me.The story is sad, Steve Carrell's character has been hit with one punch to the gut after another and goes to find his war buddy's after 30 years to help him out. It's a road trip story basically without much in the way of anything happening on the road trip. It seemed like Brian Cranston's character did all the talking followed my Larry Fishburne and Carrell who the story was about was regulated to the background. Everything about this movie felt to shallow. I didn't really care about any of the characters so their emotions didn't extend to me. It was only in the final scene where I felt a little bit but even then it wasn't much.I think everyone was good as far as the acting goes so it wasn't bad acting that made this a mediocre movie it was the writing. There was just almost nothing there.I just happen to be working my way through Ken Burns' Vietnam War docuseries which is way better than this movie and brings home the folley of war a lot better than this movie. I really wanted to like Last Flag but can't say I enjoyed it.",6,1,1,3 August 2018
Deadpool 2," Better than average and average is crap these days
","I enjoyed Deadpool the first a lot, it was different and I believe really helped break the boring Marvel mold. I enjoyed Deadpool the second a bit less.There was nothing new with this Deadpool. It was funny, gross, entertaining and filled with decent action, but nothing different from the first with the exception of a couple new characters. The jokes were not as good, I was finding this time around the comedic timing was a bit off or it was too forced or too much, like breaking the 4th wall is great and can be really funny but when its done too much it loses its humor (for me anyway). Having said all that even the worst Deadpool movie (this one was the worst of the 2) is better than almost all other Marvel movies out there.",7,0,1,14 August 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," One of the better Marvel movies of late
","I have been getting kind of tired of the meh super hero movies lately. Thor turned out to be funnier than I was expecting, had enough action to keep me entertained. I am too lazy to rank all the marvel movies out there but this one is nearer the top of the list for me. It doesn't always take itself seriously and then it does just enough to make it worthwhile, kind of like Deadpool (but Deadpool is way way better).",7,2,5,20 February 2018
The Terminator," Still an awesome movie decades later
","It's not perfect don't get me wrong. Someone who watches it now who only knows the smooth (2018) CGI affects will definitely notice how dated and obvious some of the special effects are, like the bathroom scene with Arnie after a car accident (you know the scene for those who have seen it).But if you don't mind (and I don't as a child of the 70's) the special effects, the clothing and the music all sastisfy my nostalgia for all things 80's. So not only do I get my nostalgia fix I also get a really great story and LOTS of action.This movie will be a forever classic for me and I will rewatch it with reckless abandon!",10,2,4,5 March 2018
Ready Player One," Not sure I liked it... is that weird?
","Saw this in the theatre so the visual and audio experiences were great, which is why I give it a 6. I haven't read the book yet so I am just going off of what I was thinking this movie would be.It didn't feel like a Speilberg... if that makes any sense. It seemed shallow, like an attempt at his earlier work. The story was nothing you haven't seen before (the base story that is). Good vs bad follow the same formula of 100's of other movies and you get the end result. The setting was kind of cool. I say kind of because after awhile I don't know why but I didn't want to see the CGI anymore, it felt less threatening and real than the scenes in 'the real world'. I had a problem with the 3D in this movie, not sure if I got a bum pair of glasses, the movie wasn't really shot in 3D but there was a number of scenes that were a little jittery and with 3D made it so blurry and hard to see that I had to look away.The pop culture references were too numerous to even get all in one viewing and it seems thats what this movie was heavily relying on, it got a little stale by the end of the movie.I think this was a good movie, I may have liked it but it will take another viewing for me to know for sure.",6,0,0,9 April 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Not only the best Spider Man movie but I think the best Superhero movie
","I haven't seen ALL the Marvel superhero movies but as of late I have found them to be boring, lacking in any real characters, even the action sequences seem boring (on average). When Iron Man came out in 2008 I was soooooo stoked to finally be getting a decent super hero movie. Then Marvel repeated themselves over and over and over again.Previous Spiderman movies have all come up short. Some had ok leads, ok bad guys, ok support cast. Homecoming seems better in every category. I think they finally found the right person to play Peter Parker/Spiderman. I was really skeptical when they said Vulture was going to be the main bad guy I was dissapointed. He was one of the lamest villians from the comics. So I avoided this movie having been disspointed so many times. Michael Keaton was perfect for the role.The only thing I had a beef with was the corny boat scene, which was shown in the trailers. You slice a boat in half, you aren't going to just push it back together before it sinks. That was really dumb and it felt lazy on part of the writers. They could have done it a million different ways. Other than that a solid Spiderman movie, webs above the others!",9,16,27,23 April 2018
Shutter Island," Probably a better movie if you watched it when it came out
",I for some reason didn't watch this when it was first released. Unfortunately I have seen a lot of talk about it over the years and have had some pieces spoiled for me so I kind of already new what was going on. Except the movie was done well enough that I still questioned what was happening until the end. Great movie but for me wish I had seen it earlier.,7,0,0,18 June 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," almost a good action movie but a terrible star wars film
","I am done with Disney, done with Star Wars and done with JJ Abrams. Why writers/directors/hollywood feels the need to throw away previously established myth/legend/cannon whatever you want to call it is beyond me. You could pluck a story from any one of the 100's of books and comics and make a terrific movie that people could enjoy. Instead they have to copy and paste previous movies. These last three movies felt more like they were trying to reboot the original three movies and they, like most of hollywood don't know how to reboot anything.I went into this one with an open mind and found myself enjoying the scenery. The shots and special effects are great. Lots of epicness there. The story however was all over the place and at times nonsensical to the point where I was asking too many questions which of course takes you out of the movie. Story archs just disappear, like Rose and Fin, they barely talk in this one. So I guess they didn't fall in love or anything, we don't know and we never will because this is just one of many many unanswered questions (something JJ loves to do). But it doesn't work. I am a huge Star Wars fan and have a small understanding of some of the other stories out in the Star Wars verse but I found myself lost throughout this movie.I am tired of these big blockbusters that are so lackluster and so shallow that they are more entertaining to watch as a train wreck than as a piece of entertainment. I am out, no more movies for me.If you are like me and love Star Wars just rewatch the original three and pretend like everything else doesn't exist.",5,6,9,6 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Worst of all the star wars movies
","Yes even Phantom Menace. At least Phantom Menace can be kind of fun to watch mostly because it sticks to the tried and true Star Wars formula (even though it does it badly). The acting in Phantom is bad, because they put all their money on a poor little kid who couldn't act, surrounded him with actors who seemed to have never worked with green screens before and CGI that hasn't aged well. This movie removed the kid and replaced him with an equally bad adult actor, stretched out his dialog to not only be bad but boring and once again filled the movie with CGI which in some scenes is ok but in others clearly seems fake, like one step away from seeing the black out line around the character (you know like in old 80's commercials that used background screens). I am a fan and unfortunately a bit of a completionist so I will watch these movies over again but don't really enjoy them. I don't think even 10 year old me would have like this movie since there are so many long drawn out dialog scenes that really slow the pace of the movie down. This movie is trying to be too serious so it's really not that fun to watch. What a stinker!",4,2,4,18 September 2018
Bird Box," Pretty good thriller/horror
","An excellent addition to this genre. I recently watched a quiet place which I like a bit more than this one.Bird box gets you wondering, what the heck is happening and it never really answers that question. Which I felt like needed a bit more flushing out. The length of the movie mixed with the shallowness of the plot left me a little wanting.The movie is rated R so that helped raise the tension especially since you start to wonder, will they kill all the main characters? Sandra Bullock puts in a solid performance.All in all I would say a very entertaining movie that I wouldn't bother watching again but definitely worth watching once.",7,0,1,28 December 2018
Baby Driver," Entertaining but overrated
","This movie got a lot of hype around it. While I did find it entertaining and had a really good tie in with the movies soundtrack and the main character the plot/storyline was a little thin in places.Pretty good acting by all involved. Great action sequences, the car chase/driving scenes definitely was the highlight of this movie.The plot and pacing of this movie were very formulated. You have seen this movie before and probably better done, Gone in Sixty Seconds rings a bell here and is a better movie. Other than the unique mix of a soundtrack and how they integrated it into a tool for the character this was a pretty generic movie. If you go into it looking to be entertained and don't expect much from it you should have a good time.",6,1,2,26 February 2018
Split," finally a Shamalamadingdong movie I can get behind
","I LOVED his earlier works, loved Unbreakable, loved everything The Village, Lady in The Water (they were weak movies but I still found them entertaining) but after that he went right downhill. This seems like he has recovered, at least for now.That James MacAvoy ... so hot right now! He really made this movie intense. All of the acting from everyone was pretty spot on. I really was biting my nails during this one.It had a bit more gore than I was expecting, I don't think Unbreakable had any so it was a little unexpected. A great movie! Would totally recommend to watch (maybe watch Unbreakable first).",8,0,1,19 February 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," One of the better movies out there
","I really enjoyed how quirky this movie was from it's animation style to it's characters to the plot. I liked everything about this movie and I wasn't expecting too. Don't get me wrong I love animated movies and I like super hero movies and I really like Spiderman. But I usually watch animated movies with a bit lowered expectations. They are generally entertaining but can be 'cheap' as in weak, writing, weak voice acting, weak plot. This was a full blown made for prime time blockbuster movie.The acting in this is great, they used a lot of triple A actor's for the roles. The plot is pretty good (although feels a bit rushed, but nothing you can't overlook). The style is crazy and kind of disjointed but it all works very well. It felt like an omage to Stan Lee, they literally brought a comic book to life and they did it well (a wink an a nod in Sony's general direction).It's a fast paced movie that is suitable for all ages. There is some scary loud scenes and a couple of death scenes if you have littles that are sensitive this might be too much but my 5yo was ok watching and she is pretty sensitive.I will be using this movie to compare all my future watchings of animated or hero movies.",9,0,0,15 October 2019
Dunkirk," World War 2 told in a very different way.
","I can see why people don't like this movie. It is VERY different from the usual telling of a war tale. I was blown away by how much this movie made me feel. Blown away because for a movie about war there was very little dialogue, very little action and very little blood (comparing it to the likes of Saving Private Ryan). Having said that it struck me deeply. I love the way this movie unfolds. It flips timelines quickly and often. There is almost no character development. But it all works perfectly together. I can't remember the last time I was paying attention to the music so much in a movie as I would find myself tensing - while watching people walking on a beach. The music was definitely setup to disturb you while you watch certain events unfold. The very few action scenes were made extra tense because the music was so perfectly done.I loved this movie and would recommend it to anyone although I think I would warn them that it's not going to be what they expect.",10,1,3,24 January 2018
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," I didn't like this movie
","I really wanted too (like it) as I am a huge fan of all things Harry Potter but I just couldn't get into this movie. I forced myself (and my wife) to watch this over the course of 3 sittings. It was so boring in the beginning and I really didn't care for any of the characters.I also found the CGI in this movie was a bit off putting, I am not sure if there was just too much of it, or maybe they didn't do it right or maybe the actors weren't grooving properly in front of the green screen but I really felt like Newt was talking to himself most of the time. I found his character annoying too. Nearer the end when the focus was off of Newt and his wonderfully awesome CGI beasts (blarf) the movie finally started to pick up. If this is the first in a series then I would compare it to the first Harry Potter and although I find it a bit cheesy and childish I think Philosopher's Stone did it better than this one. I REALLLLLLY want it to get better and I will give the next movie a try but it's hanging by a thread for me. Super disappointed :(",5,1,3,27 August 2018
Ocean's Eleven," Really good movie but...
","I haven't watched this movie for a long time and it is a great heist movie don't get me wrong but.... I think this is one of those movies that is fantastic when you watch it and see the twist for the first time. I guess it's not much different than watching a murder mystery, not much point in watching one of those again, cuz it's no fun when you know who dun it.Excellent cast, great acting all around. Even though this movie came out in 2001 it could be modern day as most of it takes place in or around a casino and they all look fairly the same like the inside of casinos are decorated all the same and don't really change - probably some science there to get our money. Anyway if you HAVEN'T watched this movie I would recommend it, one of the better heist movies out there.",7,0,1,12 March 2020
Die Hard 2," as fun as the first one but...
","... slightly cheasier. This one took everything that people loved from the first one and dialed it up a notch. But it works. Again this is why 80's (early 90's) action movies were great. They knew you were there to be entertained. This movie delivers.Now that I think about it, there is no gratuitous nudity in this one. It has been replaced by a hip talking grandma who tasers her dog.There is one scene where a lot of people get killed, that was a little too serious in my opinion for this movie but it's nothing you can work with, it just is a little disturbing for me and a particular phobia I have.This really is just Die Hard the first one times 2, instead of Nakatomi Plaza it's New York airport. It all works great. If you loved the first one you will love this one, just don't expect it to be better than the first one and you should be fine.",10,0,0,4 December 2018
Avengers: Endgame," Hollywood needs to invest in writing classes
","Nothing infuriates me more than a time travel theme in a movie where it doesn't belong. Oh the main character dies...boom time travel fixes it. Want to rewrite an old franchise....mmm time travel. Out of ideas of what to write about, time travel. There are some movies that do it well and others that fall flat, unfortunately this one fall flat for me. I was a HUGE fan of the original comic story this was loosely based off of. There were so many disappointments in this I don't even know where to start.CGI sucks, unless you are pairing it on top of live actors or making it seem like it has substance, 2 cgi characters fighting is like watching 2 clouds smash together. There is no weight to the characters... literally.The humor choices were lame, why strip away what makes the hulk the hulk. I wanna see hulk rage and smash everything in his path. He is supposed to be a barely contained, controllable character. In this movie they completely neutered him. They did almost the same thing with Thor. I get they wanted to show he has been through the ringer but it was a poor way to do it. Although he at least fights in the movie so he isn't as neutered as the hulk.The women power scene I found was so forced and felt like pandering to the highest level that I felt it took away from empowering women instead. I am all for strong women characters but this was so forced it almost felt icky to watch not to mention begs the question.... did all the women plan this out ahead of time, cuz in a crazy battle like that it seems unlikely they would all happen to be in the same spot.Did I mention how weak sauce I think time travel themes are?Out of all the Marvel movies this one ranks middle bottom. Want an excellent Marvel movie, go watch Ironman or Logan..",5,3,7,3 September 2019
1941," A stupid movie with not much going for it
","I like funny stupid movies, Dumb and Dumber, Something About Mary, Animal House to name a few. This movie just missed the mark on all the it's jokes. Things that should have been more goofy were too serious (aka Treat Williams as a total rapist psycho, somehow that was supposed to be funny?)I wanted to like this movie since it was Speilberg's first attempt at comedy but it is pretty bad and even though I read the previous reviews and heard all about how it stunk I still gave it a shot. It wasn't worth it. There are other way funnier stupid movies out there to spend your time on. Your not missing anything by not watching this one.",5,1,2,29 January 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," Not bad Marvel not bad
","I am a huge fan of the comic series this is adapted from and was hoping it would be epic, like the comic book. It wasn't terrible (but alas not close to the awesomeness of the comic). Lately Marvel movies have been rather meh, this one was much better, maybe because it didn't focus on any on character for very long, had enough humor and action to keep the pace going.I am coming to the realization that these movies are really geared towards kids, and made entertaining enough so the parents won't be put off by watching. When I think about it like that 12 year old me would have been giving this a 10 and I would have wanted more more more.Out of the recent Marvel movies I have seen, Black Panther and Spider man, this one is the best, followed by Spiderman and Black Panther. Looking forward to the next chapter.",7,0,2,7 August 2018
Get Out," Did not expect this to be as good as it was
","I really enjoyed this movie. I don't watch horror movies anymore (the world is horrific enough for me). But I took a chance on this one. There is a little bit of gore but really nothing that doesn't fit in. I kind of saw the ending coming - I can't remember if I picked up on something out on social media or if I figured out what was happening. But I still didn't see it all coming so the twist was still kind of cool.The acting was great, it really was the acting that made this movie so creepy and sinister so you KNOW something is going to happen and are expecting it but the tension keeps building.The sunken place was creepy enough for me to be really freaked out for the hero, who would want to live their life there??? Death would be better. There is a lot of social commentary in this movie about race, elitism, the current tensions in the US between the haves and the have nots but it is done smoothly so that these big ideas and don't get in the way of the movie.For his first time out Jordan Peele has hit a home run.",7,1,1,31 January 2018
A Quiet Place," Better than average horror
","This movie contains violence towards kids. As a dad I am really sensitive to seeing bad stuff happen to kids in movies and tv. There is no real gore, a couple of scenes where you see some blood but they did a good job of keeping it pg.Weird monsters have taken over the world that hunt by sound so the whole premise is for the characters to stay quiet. The movie does a good job of building tension by using this idea and only teasing of the dangers surrounding the characters. We don't get a full reveal until much further into the movie. There are some problems with this movie as with any movie but it was entertaining enough for me to look past it's problems and just enjoy it for what it was, a fun scary movie (well, my level of scary anyway).This kind of reminded me of that movie Reign of Fire where the world is taken over by dragons, mixed with the fixation of a global event but from the eyes of a family like in Signs. Both of those movies would be on par with this one.I will be looking forward to seeing what Krasinski comes up with next.",7,1,1,10 October 2018
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Better than some previous chapters but also kind of meh
","12 year old me would have LOVED this movie! The ghost pirates were cool looking and the story was ok.The current me, the older, wiser, less mature...er more mature me thinks this was just an ok movie. Captain Jack seems less of a character in this one for some reason. Maybe there were too many characters? Or maybe this was the 5th installment of the same movie and was a little worn around the edges.But having said that if you are a fan of the Pirates series then you will probably like this one. I will say even though it's made for families I think the baddies are a little scary looking for some littles (my little one would have nightmares for months if she watched this movie).",6,1,2,31 May 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," I didn't hate this movie but was very dissapointed
","All in all it wasn't The Phantom Menace... I hate those three movies even exist. So when I watch these new movies I can't help but say...well that sucked but it was no Phantom Menace.There were so many things to hate about this movie I am going to try and stay positive and go over the things I liked.Pretty much all the battle scenes were cool to watch, I tried really hard to ignore things like why is there gravity in space (space bomber scene). But whatevs. Rey and Kilo's characters where well developed. The comedy was pretty well placed.Spoiler - the Rebel ship slicing through the Empire's (sorry first orders) fleet was a cool scene and the only reason I didn't totally despise Laura Derns purple haired character.I will probably rewatch this at some point but not for a very very long time.The Force Awakens as unoriginal as it is was a much better movie.",6,1,11,23 March 2018
The Imitation Game," a very captivating movie
",I found I was pulled into this movie right off the bat. It felt a lot faster paced then I was expecting and found myself totally enthralled even though I knew how it turns out.This drama is filled with excellent acting all around and jumps around the timeline to keep things interesting and engaging. It felt a little rushed and glossed over some major things but considering the length of the movie it is to be expected. By the end of the movie I was in tears. Would recommend this to anyone who is interested in WW2 era history/dramas.,8,0,0,15 March 2020
Logan," One of the better X-men movies out there but...
","I stopped watching this movie about half way through. I had seen most of the Marvel movies out there and thought I knew what I was getting into with Logan.My first half run through I was shocked by the level of gore and it just kept coming. I am not a big fan of gore but am ok watching it if it has it's place and doesn't make me gag. I just wasn't ready for the new version of Wolverine, face slicing death machine. Then there was the story line - I won't spoil anything but I found about half way through I was just overcome with kind of a sadness (because of some serious violence towards kids) and it was depressing so I turned the movie off, I wanted more of a fun good guys vs bad guys, explosions, sprinkle in a car chase, good guy wins - you know... every other Marvel movie out there.After having some time to digest what I saw I went back to it more prepared than I was before. The fight scenes are amazing, the story line is fantastic. This is a stand alone superhero movie. I would have rated it higher but ever since I became a dad I can't stand seeing violence against kids, even if it is pretend. There is a lot of violence towards kids and a lot of violence from kids in this movie and when I say kids, like 12-14 year olds.",7,0,3,31 May 2018
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Not the strongest of movies but still a huge fan
","I first watched this on VHS way back in the day, I remember thinking eh... it was ok, then a few years later got into the books and came back to watch the movies and BAM that was it.The only thing I will say about this one is it is a little rough for some of the more sensitive kids out there. There is some pretty scary scenes including the death of a unicorn as well as a pretty graphic death scene of one of the characters.I can re-watch all of the Harry Potter films over and over again from 1 to 8 any time. They are consistently well done and for what the earlier movies 1 to 3 are they are endearing magical stories that have a high entertainment value.",10,1,2,19 November 2018
Die Hard," This is everything that is good and right in a movie
","Die Hard is the action movie I compare all other action movies too. The action is over the top and great. The villians are loathsome and menacing. The main character is an everyday guy you can root for, who by the end has seen some better days (vs the kind of good guy that can walk through a nuclear explosion unscathed).There is the right amount of humor, boobs, swears and splosions! It is why 80's action movies were the best. They knew when to not take themselves as serious and when to get down to work and show the goods. The supporting good guys (beside Al) are buffoons who are worse than the actual villians. It's just John Mclane vs the world!This is a fun entertaining movie that has aged perfectly. I rewatch this one every year, sometimes a few times.",10,0,0,4 December 2018
Joker," A very well done dark movie about a man's descent into madness
","I had to stop watching this movie the first time I tried watching it, I wasn't in the mood for a super dark movie. So glad I came back when I was in the right frame of mind. This had me captivated from the beginning. Jaquin Pheonix's acting is the best I have ever seen from him here.The story is simple, it's the back story of The Joker. You watch as this poor guy suffers with mental health issues and just can't get a break. He seems like a guy who wants to do good and be good but the world around him just keeps beating him down. He goes through a transformation the we are along for the ride. It is a devestating portrayal of a character we know from previous iterations but never seen in this kind of light.This is not an action movie, so don't expect lots of action. There is some and there is some pretty intense violent scenes but overall its a drama. I would recommend this to anyone but I am not sure if it fits into the Batman Universe of movies. It is definitely a stand alone movie.",9,2,4,27 January 2020
Edge of Tomorrow," Sci Fi (time travelling) action done right... for a change
","I am a big fan of Sci Fi, a big fan of action and a medium fan of Tom Cruise. I am NOT a fan of time travelling scenarios ... looking at you Star Trek reboot. I find it tends to be lazy writing half the time... oh this thing has changed... hmm well... time traveller altered the course of your known universe that explains everything. BAH!This movie however handles it very well, with just enough humor and the right moments of action shown to be a very interesting movie. Tom Cruise has proven he is great in Sci Fi movies. I liked the character development. All the acting was superb even from the smallest of roles. This one makes it onto my forever going to rewatch it list cuz it's that good. See you in about a year (or just before the sequel comes out) Edge of Tomorrow!",10,0,1,26 November 2018
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," A slog to get through but does have some pretty good highlights
","Compared to episodes 1 and 2 I like this one the most but thats not to say I like it very much. If this wasn't a Star Wars movie I would never watch it again. As it is I rewatch the universe of movies every so often.This movie looks pretty good, the opening space battle has a lot going for it. The slow build up to revealing the emperor is pretty good. The fall of the Jedi is always hard to watch and the creation of Darth Vader is one of the best scenes in the movie (followed immediately by it's worst NAAAAAAAOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHH!!!)Thats about all this movie has going for it. There is too much talking and scenes that seem to slow the movie down rather than help it along. The acting from every corner of this movie is pretty bad, I think an example of bad acting or maybe directing spreading throughout the cast because we have seen a lot of these actors do way better in other movies.Well time to tuck this movie away until I rewatch the series again. Maybe with time this movie will age well... yeah right.",6,0,0,3 October 2018
Sherlock Holmes," Not as good as newer Sherlocks
","This was my second viewing of this movie. I liked it better by first run through. Since my first viewing back in 2009 I have watched the latest Sherlock Holmes played by Bennedict Cumberbatch. I liked the modern updated version better than the Robert Downey Jr. rendition. Acting was good, sets were nice to look at, story was pretty good but overall it just lacked for me.If I had to choose between this and watching the BBC Sherlock Holmes - Bennedict wins.",6,0,1,7 February 2018
Wonder Woman," One of the better superhero movies of late
","I liked Batman v Superman - it had some darker themes and seemed a bit grittier than what Marvel has been pumping out (with the exception of newer movies like DeadPool and Logan). I was expecting something a bit more shallow from this movie but found the characters to be endearing and the fact that they kill off some of them makes for emotional moments. I don't know how close this was to Wonder Woman's character from the comics, I don't remember her having the ability to smash through buildings. Some of the CGI gets to carried away. The slow mo action scenes were better than the scenes of her jumping really fast all over. But it was all forgivable and didn't take me out of the story.",7,0,1,17 January 2018
The Wolverine," If you like Wolverine and seeing Huge Jackmans huge muscles this movie is for you
","A really typical superhero movie. Lots of action and fight scenes. Nothing the really sticks out and nothing special. This will probably be the only time I ever watch this movie, it was a watch it and forget it kind of thing.The plot was a little thin and there is one character that switches sides at the last minute with no real explanation as to why which kind of bugged me. But other than that it was enjoyable for me. Would compare it to just about all the other X-men/Wolverine movies out there.",7,0,0,14 February 2018
Black Panther," reviews are hard!
","I have been having a hard time with my own review system, just my own opinion of movies. It's not because I don't like something but when compared to garbage something that isn't garbage seems good. Having said that I am not sure where all the hate comes from for this movie, so many 1's and 2's in the reviews. It's no masterpiece but it was more fun to watch than Ant Man and I would give Ant Man a solid 6, hell I hated Iron Fist and I would give that a 5. Compared to those this movie is a 7 for me. Compared to some of the greatest movies of all time, maybe a high 5 low 6, but not close to a 1 or 2.Awesome graphics for the most part - humans jumping around are hard and I watch it on an older LCD 55' so some of the shots/transitions are messed up/blurry for me, this seems to happen with a lot of the bigger CGI scenes (not just this movie for me). The acting was ok, I liked the 2 main characters they seemed real and flushed out enough. I thought Jordan's acting was a little under whelming but still ok. No one stood out as a stinker.The story was very mediocre - you could have bet money on the outcome after hearing they were going to make this movie... or any Marvel movie that is. Good guy vs bad guy - guess what happens. But the backdrop and the way they present the movie saves the day in my books. The fight scenes could have used less CGI but other than that it was an entertaining flick.",7,0,1,11 June 2018
Casino," One of the best gangster films out there
","I haven't rewatched this one in a long time. This is a great mobster movie, up there with Goodfellas and GodFather. The acting is great, although I found Joe Pesci as a lady's man a little hard to believe and doubt he would have been cast in todays Hollywood (you know if he was still young that is, but he was on fire in the 90's). I am not a fan of Sharon Stone but she is excellent in this movie as well.For a movie that is just under 3hrs it moves pretty fast, has lots of action gets pretty tense near the end and there are some brutally violent scenes. It also takes place in the 70's and 80's so everything looks dated and it's supposed to so this movie ages really well. I am adding this to my list of movies I will or would recommend to rewatch over the years.",10,2,4,25 July 2018
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," I adore this movie
",Out of all the Star Wars movies this one is my favorite. I have watched the original version and the new versions and can say that the unaltered original version holds up over all this time. LOVE IT!!!!!1111oneoneone,10,0,0,3 October 2018
Da 5 Bloods," I wanted to like this movie but... the bad reviews are all correct
","This was just terrible. If it wasn't for the gore this would be a made for TV movie from the 90's. Most of the acting was really bad, the dialogue felt unscripted but not in a good way. The story was mediocre at best and the way the characters abandon their convictions over what seems like no reasons it made it seem like it wasn't done on purpose but just from lack of any kind of good writing.I was expecting to see more around what it was like to be a black soldier in Vietnam but there was so little service paid to this topic it was literally a few guys standing around going 'Oh man it sucks to be a black soldier in Vietnam... which is where we are right now... in Vietnam... because they are just using us black soldiers. Hey man did I mention to you I am a black soldier in vietnam?' This is such a HUGE topic that deserves a much better media outlet than this piece of trash.Ken Burns does an amazing job of covering the war in his documentary The Vietnam War it is a bit of an investment though at about 20hrs to watch. BUT it goes into the details of it all (if you want to watch about the war). There are so many better movies depicting the struggles of Black Americans, like Malcom X, Detroit, Glory just to name a few. Don't bother with this movie it has NO redeeming qualities.",1,6,7,30 June 2020
Annihilation," More like a drama that has some sprinkling of horror and action
","There were things I really liked about this movie, like how it strived to be slightly different and beautiful in some ways. The visuals were well done, the music score set a tone of unease and wonder at the same time. The acting was fairly ok. The idea behind it was intriguing and makes me want to read the book it was based on. However....There were some pretty big plot holes that were hard to forgive, I kept thinking, well if this was real the military would do things this way. There was a made for tv vibe when it came to the 'horror' aspects and I think it's because there was so little of it and spread so far apart that it felt slow, hence why this feels more like a drama.There are a lot of unexplained things in this movie that don't really resolve to a statisfying point and at one point I thought well I guess that is kind of the point of this movie. It's a bit of a philosophical noggin scratcher so if you are not in the mood to question the meaning of your own existence and how life as we know it is a construct of our own psyche then skip this one and watch Predator (a straight up shoot em up sci fi action. slightly horror movie).All in all I was entertained by this movie but I can see why people don't like it. Worth a 6 for me but probably would never rewatch it.",6,1,1,21 October 2019
Incredibles 2," A pretty good, predictable fun, family movie
","If you liked the first one you will probably like this one. You will also probably have the whole movie figured out before the first ten minutes are done.This one picks up exactly where the last one ended, which I liked as far as continuity goes. Not much to say about this one. I would recommend to anyone who is a fan or has kids.",6,1,1,19 February 2019
The Nice Guys," I think I am becoming impressed with mediocre movies
","I like to write reviews so I can go back and see what I thought of the movie, a little visit to past me. Lately I have noticed that I am giving high marks - a 7 for me is a decent movie maybe worth rewatching in the future. I definitely need to write down what I thought of this movie because it wasn't really worth remembering and I am sure I will forget. There was nothing really special about this buddy cop movie (or buddy detective whatever). Comparing it to ones I really like, like Lethal Weapon this one falls flat, but gets a 7 because its better than what goes for a 6 these days. It has it's entertaining moments, but found the villian was flat, the ending was meh. The only thing that really carried it was the backdrop (the 70's) and the Crowe and Gossling. That was about it. I found my attention waning after about halfway through.Lethal Weapon - way better.",7,0,1,4 June 2018
Beetlejuice," A fun 80's Tim Burton movie
","Cheesy, creepy, a little gross and funny. I have seen this movie several times over the years and find it entertaining to watch each time. It has that cheese factor that Burton movies tend to posses but in a charming way. I guess it doesn't hurt that this movie brings me back to my childhood and holds a high level of nostalgia. One of my favorite 80's movies.",8,1,1,4 September 2018
