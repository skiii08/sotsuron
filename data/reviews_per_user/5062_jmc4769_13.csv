50 First Dates," Great Valentine's Day Movie
","If you can get past a not too offensive gross-out scene and some sex jokes, this is a delightful romantic comedy, one which I predict will become a classic of its type, right up there with When Harry Met Sally, Groundhog Day, and Sleepless in Seattle. Sandler's and Barrymore's earlier collaboration, the Wedding Singer, was good, but 50 First Dates is even better. For each actor, this is their most appealing role yet. Sandler is in his sweet and lovable guy mode (think Wedding Singer or Big Daddy). Barrymore is radiant and charming. They have an amazing romantic chemistry.This movie shows that you can generate more romantic sparks between the characters if they don't go to bed thirty minutes after they meet (pay attention, Hollywood). Also, this is one of the few romantic comedies that is laugh-out-loud funny. Bottom line â€“ highly recommended. I give it 8 1/2 out of 10.",9,0,0,18 February 2004
Finding Neverland," The magic is missing
","Production Values: Excellent; great cinematography, costumes, sets, etc.; sure to be nominated for Oscars in several categoriesCharacter Development: Good, as you would expect in this kind of movieCharacter Appeal: Kate Winslet's Sylvia is warm and appealing, but Winslet doesn't have that much to work with here. Depp's Barrie is oddly stiff and restrained.Target Audience: More likely to appeal to women and children.My Take: After seeing the previews, I was prepared to love this movie. Yet despite the fact that Neverland oozes quality, it didn't hold my interest until the final third. Up to that point, the movie consists mostly of scenes in which Barrie plays make-believe games with Sylvia's children. These scenes didn't work for me at all. Barrie is supposed to be relating to the children on their level, like Peter Pan. But Depp's Barrie pales in comparison with the character Barrie created. Depp isn't nearly as convincing in the role of child-man as Mary Martin was in the classic TV version of Peter Pan. It doesn't help that the director chose to insert fantasy sequences during the make-believe scenes rather than letting Depp use his acting skills to convey each imaginary situation. The only other potentially interesting thing going on in this first section of the movie is the budding relationship between Barrie and Sylvia, if you can call it that. There is not a touch between them or even a longing glance. They only talk about the kids, not each other. The movie does pick up in the final third when rehearsals start for Peter Pan. But in the end it becomes an overly sentimental tear-jerker. 6 out of 10",Null,1,3,2 December 2004
This Is the End," If only this were the end of movies loaded with jokes about male body parts
","Wow, my wife and I thought this movie was horrendously bad. It was the worst movie we have seen this year with no other close competition. Imagine a home movie that a middle schooler would make and add a little CGI and a lot of vulgarity. It was mind-numbingly boring, idiotic, and crude. So many of the scenes were just filler that could easily have been cut out. To us it was amateurish and self-indulgent. The actors, who play themselves, were so obnoxious that it makes you never want to see a movie again with them in it, especially Michael Cera. We watched for 50 minutes, which seemed like 2 hours of torture, and then walked out. I can't even recommend this movie to people who liked Pineapple Express. I liked Pineapple Express myself, but if that was a B+ movie, then this one is an F-. How the heck did this get a Rotten Tomatoes rating of 84%? Were they watching the same movie? I would advise reading the 'hated it' reviews on this site before you spend money on a ticket.",1,16,41,28 June 2013
Lost in Translation," Way over-rated
","This is one of those slow-paced movies with a lot more atmosphere than substance. This is not necessarily a bad thing. If you want to see a truly wonderful atmospheric, slow-paced movie, go see Scarlett Johansson's other recent movie, Girl with a Pearl Earring. But Lost in Translation just doesn't work for me. Not much happens. There isn't much dialog and what little dialog there is comes across as bland and uninteresting. Despite all the hype, Bill Murray sleepwalks through his role. As for Johansson, she was much better in Ghost World and Pearl Earring. The May-September relationship between the two does have a kind of poignant bitter-sweetness, but it doesn't go anywhere. They just walk around Tokyo for a few days, not saying much to each other (and that's about all that happens in the movie). The director, Sophia Coppola, manages to make the Tokyo look really unexciting, not a place you would care to visit. The end result is a thoroughly boring movie – you can walk out half way through and not miss much. I give it 4 out of 10.",4,1,2,19 February 2004
Cold Mountain," Better than the preview
","I really hated the preview for this movie.  The preview had a lot of voice-over narration where Nicole Kidman is reading letters Ada wrote to Inman while he was away at war.  This narration is oh so overly dramatic like they were making this movie out to be on a level with Shakespeare.  But the movie turned out to be much less annoying.  Actually it is pretty good. Jude Law and Renee Zellweger are good in their roles.  I would agree that Zellweger deserves an Oscar nomination.  Her part is unlike anything she has ever done and it shows her range as an actress.  (By the way, if you want to see Renee's best performance, check out Whole Wide World.) 
The movie does have a couple of serious flaws, though.  For one thing, the whole premise is that Ada and Inman have this overpowering love for each other. Yet they never say more than a few short sentences to each other during the ENTIRE movie.  Despite the fact that they barely get to know each other before Inman goes off to war, he is willing to desert his army unit and travel hundreds of miles on foot to get back to her.  Yes, I know that some people do fall madly in love without really getting to know the object of their affection.  But in a movie, I need more than a few sentences to be able to buy into a relationship, especially if that relationship is the central theme of the movie.''Major Spoiler** The second problem is that I felt cheated by the ending.  You sit there for 2 1/2 hours watching this guy fight and claw his way back to Ada and then he gets killed the morning after he makes it back to her!?  When the whole movie is about someone striving to achieve some goal, you don't want that person to die when they finally get there.  That would be like Frodo falling into the pit of fire at the end of Lord of the Rings or Seabiscuit dying of a heart attack right after he crosses the finish line.  I get so tired of movies that kill off one of the main characters at the end for no purpose other than dramatic effect.  You can just imagine the movie-makers sitting around discussing the plot: 'This story just isn't dramatic enough.  Hey, why don't we have Inman die at the end?  That might be just what we need to put us in Oscar contention.'  7 out of 10",Null,0,0,27 February 2004
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Same old story
","Despite what you may have heard, Prisoner of Azkaban is very much like the other two Harry Potter movies.  I think it's a safe bet that people who liked the first two will like this one.  On the other hand, if you didn't like one or both of the others, this one has the same flaws.  Prisoner of Azkaban is a little more dark and scary, and the three kids act more like teens.  But it's really the same basic story line.  Harry can't get along with his aunt and uncle.  He performs a few magic tricks.  In short order, he returns to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry along with friends, Ron and Hermione.  At the school, the three friends attend various classes in magic and are harassed by Malfoy.  After a game or two of Quiddich, Harry encounters some supernatural menace, which by the end of the movie, he is able to overcome.  The Potter movies, like the books on which they are based, seem to appeal more to children and their mothers than to other demographics.  They don't have the universal appeal of classic children's movies like The Wizard of Oz and E T, the Extraterrestrial.  Rupert Grint (Ron) and Emma Watson (Hermione) get to do more acting this time around (especially Watson), but unfortunately, neither is up to the task.  They are caught in that awkward in-between stage that many child actors go through. They are too old to just act cute but haven't yet learned the craft of acting.  They both fare no better than the typical teen actor on the Disney Channel.",Null,0,0,30 June 2004
The Butterfly Effect," Don't Pay Any Attention to the Critics on This One
","The reviews of this movie provide more evidence that critics have lost touch with what is entertaining to the general movie-going audience.  The reviews in my hometown paper gave Butterfly Effect a 'D+' and Lost in Translation an 'A'.  Did this critic actually see the same movies that I did?  Lost in Translation, which has already been awarded a Golden Globe by the Hollywood foreign press, is so BORING that you can hardly sit through it.  Butterfly Effect, on the other hand, grabs you in the first five minutes and never lets go.  This is a thoroughly enjoyable movie, especially (but not only) for science fiction buffs.  It is one of those movies like Beautiful Mind, Fight Club, or Memento that will give you plenty to talk about after you see it.  The critics seem to dislike this movie either because (a) they don't like Ashton Kutcher-actually he does a creditable job of acting, or (b) they think the movie is too violent-it actually has very little graphic violence and is no more disturbing than Mystic River, which critics LOVE, or (c) they think there are holes in the plot.  As for this last criticism, virtually every action or science fiction movie has holes in the plot.  If critics like a movie, they just ignore them.  The bottom line is that the current IMDB rating of 7.1 makes a lot more sense than the average movie critic rating of 4.8 (from www.rottentomatoes.com).",Null,0,0,28 January 2004
Before Sunset," Great movie except for the ending
","OK, this is fair warning. Before Sunset is all talking. I would describe it as a romantic My Dinner with Andre or maybe an intellectual chick flick. The movie is one extended conversation between the two lead characters, Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy). They walk through the streets of Paris, they have coffee at a local café, they walk some more, they take a boat ride on the Seine, they are driven to her apartment, she invites him in, they talk a while in the apartment, movie over. That's it. If this doesn't sound appealing to you, forget it. You won't like the movie. People who don't like Julie Delpy or her character won't like the movie either because she has about two-thirds of the lines. Personally, I was fascinated by the conversation, and I thought Celine was mesmerizing. I did have one huge problem with Before Sunset. It ended too abruptly, before the end of the conversation. I wanted to see how things turned out, but the movie just leaves you hanging. At the screening I went to, there was a collective gasp from the audience at the end because we weren't expecting it to be over. My bottom line - great movie except for the ending (8 out of 10).",8,0,0,9 July 2004
28 Days Later...," One of the Worst Movies Ever
","This movie rates as one of the very worst that I have ever seen and I've seen a lot of movies. To say that 28 Days Later has a low-budget look would be generous. A no-budget look is more like it. This movie looks worse than my aunt's old 8mm home movies. It also has the most annoying use of a hand held camera since The Blair Witch Project. But at least that movie was supposed to look like it was shot with a camcorder. This movie also has the worse use of rapid-fire, quick-cut editing that I have ever seen in ANY movie. For example, when the zombies attack, you have absolutely no idea what is happening because the editing is so jumpy. Another problem is that this is one of those horror movies where everyone acts stupid because if they didn't act stupid, there would be no suspense. Not that there actually IS any suspense. There isn't even one mildly scary scene in this movie. It isn't scary. It's just ugly, stupid and boring. 1 out of 10",1,2,3,16 February 2004
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," The least you need to know
","Character Development: Not much, but typical for an action movie.Character Appeal: Milla Jovovich plays a kind of female Arnold Schwarzenegger, a grown-up Buffy the Vampire Slayer. She's no great actress, but she's convincing as a zombie-killer. She also has a natural, unaltered-by-plastic-surgery, beauty that makes her very appealing to the male target audience of this movie.Cinematography and Editing: OK overall. However, as in some other recent movies of this genre, you can't really see much when the zombies are being hit by punches, kicks or bullets due to a combination of quick cuts and rapid camera movement. This may bother some people, but I didn't mind it too much.Gore: Surprisingly little for a zombie movie, mainly due to the camera movement and editing mentioned above.Holes in the Plot: Typical for an action movie. The biggest one I noticed--zombies only appear when they are necessary to the plot. At times the city seems completely deserted, not a zombie in sight. At other times, on cue, masses of them appear out of nowhere. My Take: I liked The Apocalypse better than the first movie because it takes place in Raccoon City rather than in the subterranean Hive, which I found to be too monotonous and confining. This movie delivers what it promises--non-stop action from beginning to end. It's not going to win any Academy Awards, but it's good escapist entertainment. (6 out of 10)",7,1,3,5 October 2004
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Fascinating story about two losers
","ESOTSM is a science fiction romantic comedy. The basic premise is the tried and true romantic comedy plot where an ordinary but lovable guy and a kooky, free-spirited but lovable girl fall in love. Except in this case, the two lovers are not so lovable. The guy, Joel (Carrey), is not just ordinary; he's boring and inarticulate. In his imagination, he's more the ladies man, but in real life, he can't even make eye contact with women. The girl, Clementine (Winslet), is an alcoholic narcissist who comes on to guys like Joel to flatter her ego because she's too insecure to try for anyone better. In each of these relationships, she soon realizes just how boring the poor guy is, unceremoniously dumps him, and moves on to the next victim. Here is what I thought was fascinating about the movie--you never get to see what really happened between Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clem (Kate Winslet) in their first relationship. I think this is the point of the movie. It's about how our memories distort the reality of relationships. The fun of watching the movie is trying to put the pieces of the puzzle together and figure out what really happened. Unfortunately, the non-linear structure makes this more difficult. Because ESOTSM jumps around in time, it is too easy for viewers to mistakenly to interpret the movie as a series of flashbacks. Actually, I don't think there are any flashbacks at all about the relationship itself. Instead, the movie shows several distorted versions of their affair: Joel's memory of the relationship, Joel's adventure in his own mind in which he and Clem try to evade the memory zappers, Joel and Clem's tape recordings about each other, and finally their second relationship after their memories have been wiped. In each of these versions of reality, you only get hints of what might have happened. Even watching the two fall in love again doesn't tell you that much because you don't know what effect the memory wipes had on their personalities.In Joel's memory and in his imaginary adventure, he's articulate and charming. In real life, he can hardly think of anything to say to a woman. Joel remembers Clem either as more endearing or witchier than she really is. In his imaginary adventure, she is an idealized version of herself, the way he wishes she had been. I have mixed feelings about ESOTSM. I think that the subplot with Elijah Wood, Mark Ruffalo, and Kirsten Dunst was boring. The high tech equipment used to perform the memory wipes looked really cheap and unconvincing. Even the doctor's office had a cheap, low-rent look (The doctor can afford all of this cutting-edge medical equipment but he can't even get a decent office?) Ultimately, I could not get past the fact that the two main characters were such losers in real life. Nevertheless, I give the movie 7 out of 10.",7,0,1,16 April 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Good but doesn't deserve the Oscar for best picture
","If you are one of the millions who have already seen the movie and loved it, I'm sure what I say won't change your mind.  If you haven't seen the movie, but loved the books, you will probably love the movie too.  That seems to be the typical reaction from fans of the books.  But if you do not fall into one of those categories, read on.  There is a lot to like about Return of the King--spectacular battle scenes, breathtaking landscapes, and unparalleled special effects (Gollum is without doubt the most believable CGI character ever).  Make no mistake, certain aspects of this movie are very well-done.  In my opinion, it deserves most, if not all of the 'minor' Oscars it received, but just not best picture. For one thing, the 'best' picture of the year ought to have great acting. Return of the King did not receive a single Oscar or Golden Globe for acting.  True, some of the performances are good (Ian McKellen, Elijah Wood, Sean Astin), but they are not on par with, let's say, Sean Penn's and Tim Robbin's performances in Mystic River.Another major problem, one that the movie inherited from the books, is the lack of a strong central character.  There are so many main characters that they are hard to keep up with.  While this may not be a problem for people who have read the books, the movie has to stand on its own merits.  You can't strongly identify with any of the characters because none of them gets enough screen time.  The hero is supposed to be Frodo, but he is too weak and wimpy for most of the movie, his energy having been sapped by the ring. The real hero turns out to be Sam, but Frodo is the one you've been rooting for.  Of course, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) is supposed to be heroic too, but his character is too underdeveloped.  Mortensen gives a much more heroic performance in Hidalgo.  And, oh yes, there definitely are too many endings. I won't belabor this point as it has already been discussed in great detail elsewhere.  Suffice it to say that the movie is a good half hour too long. The Return of the King is an amazing achievement in some respects, but it is near the bottom of my top ten for 2003.  I give it 7 1/2 out of 10.",Null,0,1,11 March 2004
V for Vendetta," Republicans won't like this movie
","Make no mistake, this is a politically motivated movie. If you are one of the dwindling number of people who still support George Bush, don't waste your money and time. You would probably think that V for Vendetta is rubbish. On the other hand, if you liked 'Syriana' and 'Good Night and Good Luck', it's a safe bet that you'll like this one. This movie shows that democratic institutions are no protection against totalitarianism if the people of a country are willing to trade their civil liberties for security. It shows where America could be headed if the president is allowed to continue to consolidate his power and ignore the laws of the land, all in the name of security.So much for the message, is the movie any good? Surprisingly, yes. I was not expecting much based on the previews and the mixed reviews. I just couldn't imagine enjoying a movie with 'V' in the title and a main character who wears a mask the whole time. But my son likes Natalie Portman, so my wife and I took him to see it.I'm glad we did. The movie grabbed me from the start and got better as it went along. This is one of Natalie Portman's best performances and she has never looked more beautiful. Hugo Weaving makes a good intellectual hero despite the fact that he has to act without ever showing his face. That outlandish mask didn't bother me as much as I thought it would. The directing is good. McTeigue has a particularly effective street scene at the end of the movie. I liked the unpredictability of the plot. It has some totally unexpected twists. Sure, the movie is overly dramatic, but given that the stakes are so high, that didn't bother me.If you are worried about the future of America or if you are apolitical and want to see a thinking person's action flick, I can highly recommend V for Vendetta.",7,4,8,2 April 2006
