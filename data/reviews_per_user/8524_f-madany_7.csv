Casablanca," epic film
","Casablanca is an epic film. The setting is so smooth, and classy, and desperate, and just perfectly reflective of the time period. 1942, in the middle of WWII. Humphrey Bogart, makes the movie in his portrayal of Rick, who takes no sides and sticks his neck out for nobody. Until his lost love comes back into his life. For me there has always been to parts to Casablanca, before he meets Ilsa at his caf√© at night and after. It's there I see the changes in Rick. Ohh before there are a couple, but it's not until then that he really changes, but we don't exactly knew what decision he has come to. The music is another perfect addition to an already overwhelmingly good movie. And off course Defiance in the face off oppression, this movie came out at the perfect time. A time of political upheaval, war, and uncertainty.",Null,0,1,17 December 2015
Taxi Driver," taxi d
","Taxi driver is a classic that divides the fallout between one man's loneliness and his need for acceptance, recognition, and notice, and justice. He wants to fix the wrongs he sees in the cesspool that has become NY, He wants to save Foster the 12 year old prostitute. Bickle is an anti-hero, because his methods are not solely for the saving of the girl. He kills the low lives of society and is glorified for it by media. He actively plans out and trains his body for these killings, to satisfy the rage he has toward the miscreants of society. The editing is very good and Scorsese does a wonderful job directing, mainly because of the ambiguous ending of the film. But the true thing that makes this movie grate is its script and the excellent performance De Niro gives as the lead.",Null,0,1,18 December 2015
Annie Hall," loved it
","Annie Hall, was absolutely amazing. best part by far is the narrative take, and interruptions by the narrator, who is also the main lead. other best thing is the questions Allen randomly asks passer byes, and the answers they give. hahahaha cracks you up. the acting of every-last person in the movie is so real, and you can see this happening. it has an impact because it is about a relevant thing and it stars real people, doing everyday things. when your watching it, you forget its a movie, its that good. and its poignant and thought provoking, the clincher for me is that its not about finding a love, but who he lost one and how to move on from that. as well as tackling a lot of other issues that were the main concern of the 70s",Null,1,2,17 December 2015
The Graduate," I side with the older woman
","Hello there, just watched this movie for the first time in my life and i gotta say, the male lead wasn't what i expected. He just fell flat to me, as dead the younger female lead. the one who truly made an impression on me was Mrs. Robinson. Don't get me wrong, the two youngsters had to go through some crap, Ben question what he wanted to do with his life, questioning his relationship with Mrs. Robinson, having the constant family pressure on him, and the same for miss Robinson. and that whole ordeal where Ben took her to a titty bar for there first date, i wish i could have jumped through the movie and slapped him. but the person i keep coming back to is Mrs. Robinson. and what here life will be like, and of the promise Ben broke when he began to pursue miss Robinson. I know the older Robinson was a bitch, and the false accusation of rape she placed on Ben is inexcusable, but i keep coming back to what made her act so drastically? why was she turned into the villain?",7,0,1,16 December 2015
Singin' in the Rain," it was so so
","The musical singing in the rain, was OK I guess, but it wasn't all that to be. I didn't hate it nor did I like it. Reasons why being, the acting style was weird. It almost felt fake-ish. Like it wasn't real. The choreography of the dances were elaborate and done well, but at times they were too much. The story line was romantic, sweet and predictable. The editing and cinematography was nothing special or not worthy. A guess there was just no thinking the audiences had to do to get the movie, which was a turn off for me. the one slightly more than OK thing was some of the dialog. I don't mean to say that the movie was bad, it just wasn't the type of movie i enjoy watching. I'm glade i did see it because no ill understand when people reference it in other stuff",Null,2,5,17 December 2015
Pulp Fiction," Pulp fiction
","For the longest time, I'd see clips of Pulp Fiction, or people would reference it, and I'd have an image of what it was but I never watched it until recently. Let me just say I want to go back and slap my past self. This movie is a master piece. From the naturally flowing dialog that talks about anything and everything, to the actual acting of the leads John Travolta, Samuel Jackson, and Bruce Willis. It has it's over the top moments, its plan weird and bazar moments, and its violent tingly moments. And rapped all together you get pulp fiction. Literally fiction that is complete pulp. The music also has to be mention as having a huge impact on the style and overall coolness of the movie",Null,1,2,18 December 2015
Psycho," hitchcock
","An Alfred Hitchcock classic. My mom first showed me this when I was 13, then from then one we would re watch it whenever we got the chance. It's one of those movies were the more you watch it the more you understand about the film and why the director did this or that. And how that has affected you view of the film as a viewer. The acting of Bates was successful, because I never suspected him. I just thought he was an odd ball. And the shower scene, were he stabs the girl a hundred bazillion times is totally overdone and . . . and just perfect. Hitchcock wants us to know it's a movie, don't take it too seriously. Her screaming forever, remaining standing after each blow. He wants to scare us, but not too badly. Best Montage I have seen in a while as well.",Null,1,2,18 December 2015
