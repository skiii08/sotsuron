Blade Runner 2049," An Amazing Sequel
","Amazing. Everything about this movie is nothing short of amazing. One of the best and most beautiful films I've seen in a long time. A long movie that doesn't feel long at all, I couldn't take my eyes off the screen for its whole duration. Fantastic, very highly recommended!",10,3,9,12 October 2017
