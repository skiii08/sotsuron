The Equalizer," cool film
","Always love this kind of film. The good guy, after being abused comes out ahead. Big budget, like the way they slow down his actions and then speed up. Lots of feelings in this movie. Main guy helped lots of people cuz he is a good guy with a dark past. Good stuff.",10,0,2,3 August 2018
John Wick," cool film
","First off, I have a big crush on Keanu. That being said, I totally enjoyed how focused he is in this film. Hey, love Marilyn Manson and his song in this film. Big budget. Lots of killing. But john wick gets his guy. Lots of feelings of pain. Great stuff. I need to watch all his films again.",10,1,2,3 August 2018
