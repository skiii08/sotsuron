Iron Man 3," Third thim's a fail
","Having seen the first Iron Man movie, which was great and really entertaining, my expectations of the second was really high. Then came the second Iron, which was basically a mediocre movie and totally disappointed me. I was really hoping the third one to come out good. But unfortunately it was a disappointment too. There wasn't a good solid plot throughout the movie. Some characters were too intense, and without any background explanation of some of the characters, you'd just had to accept that they were evil by default. Which I don't like. It reminded my of the 'The Incredibles' where the main character Mr. Incredible's neglect of Buddy Pine transforms him into a super-villain. It's the same story here, with a bit more twist at the end.Even the CG were mediocre. The Iron Man suit animations were not even in class with some good CG animation in some PC games. But at the end, Tony Stark's reference to the metaphoric cocoon was some how intriguing. Hopefully there will be good writers on the next sequels. And I don't mean the Avengers.",6,1,4,10 September 2013

","First of all, I'm writing this mainly to thank all the people behind this motion picture. Especially the art department. You guys have made something that has touched people's minds and will be remembered as a milestone in cinema history for ever. I don't know if any of you will ever read this entry but, I hope you do. So I thank each of you for your effort and divine like skills. A special thank you goes to James Cameron. Thank you for this wonderful movie. You have immortalized your self with this picture and will be remembered like a pyramid in the history of motion picture by many.I don't want to spoil anything in this movie. I can only say that I fell in love with a CG character (Neytiri) for the first time. It's odd, but true. I have never seen a CG characters out preform real ones :D. They were so well done that sometimes during the viewing, I refused to think that they were CG characters. I know that the voices of the actors played a big role, but without the magic of the 3D artists and animators, none of it would have been possible.This movie will melt the heart of the most 'stiff' and 'hard-to-please' movie critics. If you love sci-fi, then it will totally blow your mind away.I don't care if there will be a sequel to this movie or not. But I care, and hope that James Cameron won't sell this franchise like he did with Aliens. That would lead to disaster. How you would feel if someone like 'Paul W.S. Anderson' came along and took a big dump on it? Just the thought of it makes me shiver.Oh well, I could go on for ever, or even write a book of the feelings I got for this movie. Plain and short this is how me and my friend felt/thought when we walked out of the theater with a tingling sensation....'we're not worthy', 'wow', 'James Cameron is GOD', 'Why am I feeling this way', 'how is this possible', 'how can I possibly feel love for a CG character'.",10,21,35,1 January 2010
300," Thank you Hollywood,.... NOT!!
","Before I saw this movie, I read a lot of comments about this it, and that the fact is that most of it is negative made me wanted to see this movie anyway to get my own opinion about it. Before I saw it I thought maybe some comment were too harsh or maybe not entirely accurate. But to my surprise, all of the trashing comments were very accurate. Every comment like trashy 3D/CG effects, poor directing, shitty script, racist propaganda, crappy fighting, well the list is long and you can find it all here about this movie. So I'm not going to repeat what everyone has said here, and instead direct this comment to the director of this movie. STICK TO MUSIC VIDEO MAKING PLEASE, and save everybody the wasted time, wasted money, anger, and most of all, making me feel compelled to waste 'my time' to write this comment.I don't understand how comments like 'A masterpiece' or 'An epic movie' could get so much good user ratings like '740 out of 1293 people found the following comment useful', I don't believe that a person in his right state of mind would give this movie 10 stars and call it a 'Master piece'.I give this movie2 stars, and both of the stars goes to Gerard Butlers acting performance. My advice to you, despite all this, if you have the time to waste, watch this movie anyway (try not paying for it), and you will find out that all the trashing comments for this movie are true. My last words, hopefully after this flop Zack won't get another chance to ruin the day.",1,33,53,23 August 2007
