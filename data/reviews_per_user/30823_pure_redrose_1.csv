Hereditary," Quality horror movie. I had no idea about the hype.
","After several simple ratings this is my first review. Note, I didn't watch the trailer beforehand nor gotten any of the hype.First off, if you're not sure whether to watch this movie or not, give it a go. Period. Its not nearly a bad as a b movie with amateur filming and horrible acting that it deserves 1 star. Plus, those who don't like it have probably commended at least one aspect of the film that works well... to the extent that altogether they've commended all aspects of it.Regarding the pace, it's really not bad. I personally didn't notice a lag. One reviewer here actually said there's not enough jump scares. So that kind of tells you what type of people are rating this badly. No offense but I'm just pointing that out so you understand. The film is about quality not quantity. I personally prefer the 'thriller' aspect of a scary movie rather than the jump scares and bloody scenes (these are present in the film though and blend well). If you understand and appreciate that too then you might appreciate this movie. And either way, there are enough exceptionally done twisted and bizarre scenes to fill that horror hole.Hereditary is about making you feel disturbed and creeped out, but wanting to continue watching. It's about build up to a realistic scare..not one just so you can laugh afterwards. There is a solid storyline and every scene has relevance. The story behind the evil spirit is not complicated at all, which I appreciated not for its simplicity but because there was no need to make it confusing like some films do. It worked in a sensible concise way.The family interaction is realistic, not empty. Teenagers dont normally have deep personalities per say and the mother is just being a mother. Its a typical relatable family. Not arbitrarily uncaring or over the top. Realistic.
Also, someone mentioned that it was impractical for the boy and the family not to get therapy of some type. I'll give them that. But only partially because the reality is many people don't have the desire (or money) to speak to someone else about their problems. It's not something you need to suspend disbelief for. Plus the boy's parents were not there to see what he had done and it's unlikely he would have asked to go to a therapist so they took it for what it was.Just wanted to counter a few points and give one a wider picture of the critic of the film. I'm not trying to give spoilers so about the ending I'll just say out was haunting once you understand. And i think it's easy enough to understand. The movie overall for me was one of my favorite horrors in a while. Hope you enjoy if you watch.",10,0,3,11 November 2018
