Iron Man 3," Couldn't be worse
","The movie was a disaster.I am not an Iron man fan but i enjoyed the first two movies.This one is a mess and didn't have a point.Endless jokes,unnecessary scenes,way too much Tony Stark and the list goes on.It was like watching a movie making fun of a superhero.1)The plot was bad. 2)Pepper...really?I like female characters who can handle themselves but that was completely ridiculous.I didn't know if i should laugh or cry.Maybe both. 3)The twist-BIG disappointment.I was furious. 4)final fight-It seems to me they tried to make the worst final movie confrontation in history.They nearly succeeded. 5)I feel bad for Ben Kingsley because he is a great actor and deserves better.Avoid it if you are not a fan. Avoid it if you are a fan. Actually i can't think of any logical reason(besides boredom)to watch this movie. I give it 3 stars because of the actor performances.",3,3,6,22 July 2013
Underworld Awakening," Good but not great
","This movie was good but not great.It was pretty much what you would expect.A bad-ass female vampire(Selene),great action and cool effects.Now..there are many new plot elements.The Human race is now aware of the vampire-Lycan existence and hunts them down.This is not just a vampire vs Lycans war.The humans are part of the game.This is a welcome addition but here is the downside.The focus on the story wasn't enough.It felt like an excuse for action.This is not like Underworld.The original movie had a perfect combination of action and story.In my opinion Underworld Awakening lacks new or familiar faces and characters like Lucian and Viktor.Selene is great but a good movie needs a number of main characters.Who are the vampire leaders-key characters? is there only one?did the rest of them die?Who are the new Lycan leaders?We only learn that they hate vampires(that is obvious,they are Lycans).Lucian had a character development.The new Lycan leaders...not so much.I also found the human role too small.But i have to admit...i liked the twist at the end.I hope the next movie(if there is one) is going to solve these issues.This one was enjoyable and definitely worth a watch.",7,2,5,21 July 2013
