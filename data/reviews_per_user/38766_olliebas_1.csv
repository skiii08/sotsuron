Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," worst movie I ever watched, I'll never get that 2 hours back
",This was the worst movie I have ever seen. I can't believe I actually paid for it. If you are Jewish do not go within miles of the screening! I could not believe there were not people protesting outside. There were people who walked out out the theater and I would have too but I thought that the movie would improve it did not. This is not comedy. The audience even gasped at certain scenes. There were kids in the audience who appeared to be younger than 14 years old and the rating should have been at least 18 years. Three young boys I seen entering the theater before the movie started could not have been any older than 12 years old. The movie rating people made a big mistake on this one. It was just plain awful.
