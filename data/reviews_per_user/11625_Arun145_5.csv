Vertigo," A masterful display of suspense and illusion
","Vertigo is a film I enjoyed very much. It takes what could have simply been a very average story and transforms it into a fascinating look at the human condition and how it deals with grief. Hitchcock is one of the great auteurs of cinema and he shows us why with this film, he is constantly changing the tone of the film and yet it never feels muddled. He combines genres including, Romance, Drama and Thriller; this may not seem a huge achievement but it paved the way for many filmmakers of the future to mix genres. Jimmy Stewart has a very challenging role that I believe he plays perfectly, the subtle change from private-eye to hopeless romantic is actually believable. Kim Novak is also superb as a woman with much to hide. The ending was my only problem with the film, it feels incredibly sudden and more of an exit route for the writer as opposed to an actual conclusion to the film. Nevertheless, I would certainly recommend it to any film fans as a must watch film given how much it has influenced cinema since its release.",8,6,7,9 December 2016
Lion," A beautiful story shown through a solid film
","Lion tells the true story of Saroo, an Indian boy who is separated from his family at a very young age and is adopted by a couple in Australia. 25 years later as a grown man he sets out to find his mother, brother and sister using the newly created google earth (circa 2008).This is an incredible story and it carries an important message about love, determination and the importance of family. The central performance by newcomer Sunny Pawar who plays a young Saroo is what really holds the first half of the film together, his on screen presence is phenomenal for someone so young. Dev Patel is the best he's ever been as the grown up Saroo, Oscar worthy to be sure. Supporting performances by Nicole Kidman and Rooney Mara as his adoptive mother and girlfriend are also great and very well cast. In terms of the script the film does falter in parts especially when attempting to provide character for Nicole Kidmans' character; one scene in particular involves Kidman attempting to explain a 'vision' she had as a child and this is what made her adopt Saroo and his 'brother' Mantosh. The scene feels forced and more of an attempt to add weight to her character as opposed to adding to the overall plot. Nevertheless, this is a minor flaw when compared to the brilliance within this film. One aspect I adored of this film was the musical score by Dustin O' Halloran and Volker Bertelmann. It adds so much to every scene and its the first thing that hits you when the film begins, it has an emotive tone to it and is a wonderful addition.Overall. Lion is a film I would absolutely recommend watching for its powerful message and incredible acting and score; it deserves all the awards buzz it is receiving. 8/10",8,1,2,2 January 2017
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," 'Rogue Nation' provides another stellar installment in the 'Impossible' franchise
","Tom Cruise and Co are back with a bang in this fifth installment as Ethan Hunt is in pursuit of a anti- government agency known as 'The Syndicate' whilst being chased by the CIA and Alec Baldwin. 'Rogue Nation' delivers a powerful punch by way of its remarkable action set-pieces, from Tom Cruise hanging off a plane to jumping into a whirlpool. Cruise's status as action superstar is now beyond all doubt as he is once again the star of the show, Simon Pegg and Jeremy Renner are also great, providing comic relief whilst maintaining a subtle dramatic touch to their roles. The new addition comes in the form of Rebecca Ferguson playing a skilled assassin playing both sides equally leaving the audience questioning her loyalties. Ferguson is a fantastic casting choice as she is able to share the screen with her co-stars and outshine them by some way, the 'Mission' franchise once again supplies a strong female lead which many other franchises are simply neglecting. The film hearkens back to previous mission films with an increased focus on espionage and deceit rather than the more blatant approach we received with 'Ghost Protocol' this is certainly welcome as Christopher McQuarrie, the films writer and director, creates an intricate setting in which viewers are made to think 'who is the bad guy?'. The film becomes problematic when it focuses too much on the story without utilising the characters McQuarrie shows us namely Ving Rhames as Luther Stickell who is criminally underused and instead becomes non-existent in scenes. It is also SLIGHTLY too long with an extra 10-15 mins that could do with cutting. Nevertheless 'Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation' is an accomplished piece which has some truly incredible set-pieces that action films today very rarely will compare to and is certainly one of the better films in the franchise.",9,2,5,1 August 2015
Pulp Fiction," The Greatest Film Ever Made
","This is a Masterpiece. Tarantino changed cinema forever when he created these characters, it is not one individual effort that makes this film what it is however, from the sublime direction to the quick witted script that keeps you on your toes throughout to the phenomenal and underrated performances by John Travolta and Uma Thurman Pulp Fiction is perfection. I went into this film with high expectations, I had recently been introuduced to Tarantino through his previous feature, Reservoir Dogs (which was also very good) and so was anxious to see how he would handle a bigger production with a bigger budget and some of Hollywoods best, Willis, Jackson, Travolta but there was no need to be as I was delivered a masterclass in film. A very simple premise of two mob men dispatched on a daily round evolves into something much more and the with regards to the mystery of the contents of the briefcase, a risky move by Tarantino but it ultimately paid off as people still speculate to this day about it. My belief is it contained his soul. The way in which Tarantino takes these apparently different stories and mixes them together to create some truly spectacular scenes is applaudable to say the least.",10,1,3,1 February 2015
Whiplash," Sheer Genius From Chazelle
","Where to begin, Whiplash is the reason why I love films so much, I went into this film knowing it was about a guy who plays the drums and he has a harsh teacher, and I then proceeded to have my mind blown by this extraordinary film. Firstly, Miles Teller is phenomenal and gives a performance which I hope signifies the start of a long and successful career, this guy can act!! However his performance is completely overshadowed by what I think is one of the great performances in cinematic history. J.K Simmons take a bow, he plays Terence Fletcher a psychotic, incredibly passionate music teacher who attempts to get the best out of his students, this leads to some truly brilliant encounters with Teller's character Andrew Niemann. Whiplash is a film that has your complete and undivided attention from frame 1 and this is also due to the fantastic editing in the film which skips from scene to scene without giving you a second to breathe, the tension in this film is building from the start and leads to in my opinion the greatest ending I have ever seen, a 9 minute drum solo in which you are transfixed and blown away by this man's talent. Supporting performances from Paul Reiser and Melissa Benoist are also stellar in their roles as people who are affected by Andrew's actions and his sacrifices in order to become the best. Whiplash is an inspiring film and an incredible effort by Damien Chazelle.",10,0,2,1 February 2015
