Blade Runner 2049," Did anybody Get The Handmaid's Tale Vibe With This Film?
","Because I certainly did and here is why. This movie is slow paced, I am talking snail speed here. Nothing ever happens in it and every character is pretentious as cr**. But mostly that scene where Joe pretends that he is banging Joi, the hologram chick when in fact he is banging the hooker. Joi and the hooker actually sync up before the bang and I do not mean their menstrual cycles but it involves some AI stuff. The one thing that separates said movie with The Handmaid's Tale is this movie does not have the weird feminism propaganda. I am all for feminism and girl power and all that but do not go about hating all men except probably the director of this film cause he has it coming. The film was horrible and I think he knew it so he just added female nudity to distract us men from said fact. I mean he went so far as to erecting (The pun was a happy accident) giant statues of naked women. He pretty much exploited Ana de Armas who is damn hot by the way and naked half the time in this movie (Sorry Ana de Armas for objectifying you like that) and not in the West world kind of way which is sexy at first but you get used to it like an art assignment. This movie is two hours too long. Also it took a cult classic like the original 1982 Blade Runner (Please go watch that movie instead folks) and made an unnecessary sequel without vision. For this film to be on the Imdb Top 250 is criminal I tell you. Also the twist as to who the child is did not surprise me.",6,2,3,5 May 2018
John Wick," The gangsters Took Everything from John Wick?
","Did the gangsters give John Wick's wife cancer? No but they did take everything else that was left after his wife died. Now a broken man who placed heavy sentiment on his car and dog. The unfortunate thieves were John Wick's boss' son and friends. What motivation did they really have to steal the car? I mean they're rich. Just ask your dad to buy a car like that, you idiot.So they kill his dog but they have the NERVE to steal his car. How dare they? Revenge! Silly premise. Brutal action and lots of killing. Ridiculous but enjoyable I guess.",5,0,2,26 May 2017
Deadpool 2," The Perfect imperfections.
","Has its flaws but I can overlook them. It is meta. They just had fun with the story. Gross humor, dark humor, referential humor and also some people probably got high and had epiphanies in a good way to add more hilarious analyses of pop culture. Action is great. Zazie Beetz is awesome like in Atlanta. Ryan great as usual. Josh Brolin is an amazing racist superhero like Ed Norton's American History X Men. What can I say about Morena Baccarin. I couldn't stop laughing even through the 'sad' parts. Especially the delayed opening credits. A surprise monster of a special guest with nice juggs, you will get this if you watch it. Also a shout out to Karan 'Dopinder' Soni the cabbie from the first film, you play that great song from 'Swades'. End Credits are enjoyable as well. You shouldn't have Deadpool a time machine since he is so meta. Not only Canada but probably the whole world thanks you for that one. I leave the flaws for all the negative reviewers who shall make it their life's mission to point them out to you.",9,1,4,3 August 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Worst Spiderman Ever
","This movie is a joke. First twenty minutes was a snooze fest. Michael Keaton was awesome but that's just it. A millennial spiderman is what we have here folks. The selfie taking, amateur video making, overly enthusiastic and needy little puppet of Tony Stark. Not that millennials are silly but this shits on millennials. This was an old guy's understanding of what goes through the mind of millennials. Aunt May is much younger and so attractive, the men are all after her, creepy, even tony stark was a slobbering mess upon seeing her. We get the point she's hot.Even halfway through the movie spiderman's a mess. OK he's human so he makes mistakes got it but still its ridiculous. I did not get why the folks in this marvel universe were impressed with the youtube spiderman. Captain America's fitness program lol. This spiderman is a loser that no one can depend on and the same goes for peter parker. All this guy did was get bit by a radioactive spider and really is nothing without the suit that Tony Stark made for him. Homecoming? Again lol. Plus she was peter's date. That is all they were never really boyfriend and girlfriend. This had to be said because when peter was fighting vulture guy, Peter was like 'fighting your girlfriend's dad during the homecoming night'. Also dare I say, Peter is bad news to all his girlfriends or love interests. Only the cameos and the link to the marvel universe is what redeems it. The almost use of the F-word twice was kinda funny I suppose. In the end when Captain America says the key to a great superhero is patience and something about being disappointed. I totally have to agree with him. This spiderman is very impatient and a big disappointment. The Green Lantern movie was better than this and I know you all hate that film.",4,28,43,1 October 2017
Baby Driver," Nobody Puts Baby in the Corner Especially if he is your Getaway Driver
","Funny story actually, I was watching this movie via livestream and while I waited for it to buffer, I watched another movie on TV. 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off' with Jennifer Grey, you know baby from 'Dirty Dancing'. Both 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off' and 'Dirty Dancing' were far superior movies than this. However this movie is one big funny goofball. Please don't take it seriously as it feels like a satire of the genre. In a way it is watered down 'Drive' meets 'NFS the movie'. The faults in this movie is what makes it great.Now for the faults the guys here have got it spot on: https://youtu.be/7bODxbLAvDo",8,1,5,23 September 2017
Split," Shyamalan is Back
","Personally I am not really a fan but I watched Sixth Sense, Signs and Unbreakable. Those three were really good. After making three good films in a row some said the Village was horrible but I did not see it for myself. I watched Happening and Airbender. Happening was a strange horror film and quite interesting but Airbender was where he made an unforgivable mistake. Mentioning Shyamalan to those who loved the animated show is like a taboo. I gave Shyamalan one more chance with After Earth but it was silly and devoid of reason. After Earth was still a unique film if you come to think about it. When it came to Shyamalan it was interesting to watch a potentially good director spiral out into a messy movie maker. Split sounded like a good concept but my expectations were low before I began. Split got into it straightaway, no bullshit and it keeps you guessing at every turn. As the movie progresses your expectations increase and it had a good payoff in the end. But don't you see in a way this movie speaks about Shyamalan directing ability split between the bad director and good director. The good director is back people and hopefully the bad director will not come back in control again.",7,3,9,1 June 2017
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Fantastic Movies and Where to Find Them
","J.K. Rowling does even better this time. This film is less childish than the first two Harry Potter movies in some ways. Redmayne and the entire cast were excellent. The 1920s atmosphere was swell. I have not read the book as I thought it was going to be another book that is leaching on the success of the Harry Potter franchise. The only book of hers outside the HP series that I read was The Tales of Beedle the Bard, which was alright but was not HP or anywhere close. Now I am reconsidering my decision of not reading this book.",9,1,4,3 March 2017
Beauty and the Beast," I liked it. The End.
",First of all it is not as good as the original because the original is irreplaceable. The original was a musical and so is this. Personally I hate musicals but all the Disney Animation songs were decent. The music in this movie is forgettable. Why do the actors have to sing? Can't singers just sing for them like they do in Bollywood? Emma Watson in my opinion is not a miscast as she has that book smart character down with years of experience from her HP days Also she is just over 25 so she is not too young for the role. The CGI was done reasonably and realistically unlike Jungle Book where all the animals were out of scale. I still liked Jungle Book in-spite of that error. The beast CGI does not matter. The beast is a beast what else could it be? All the animated furniture is actually done nicely and those characters were quite funny. I enjoyed the scenes with them in it. Gaston is done alright as the well. Lefou is gay. Finally some progress in Disney movies. So overall there are some faults and maybe some biases but a decent remake to pass the time.,5,0,2,27 June 2017
Sausage Party," Climax!!
","First of all never going to look at food the same way again. So its racist and offensive to everyone but it is hilarious. Some may say that it is immature. Hell yes it is. Seriously you should be at least 16 or 18 to view this. The ceiling is 30 as it may seem too crass and vulgar for those who watch 'Downtown Abbey', there is no problem in that because it is quite a good show.A man-child like myself, would want some crackers with my cup of tea. I have watched 'Food fight', which is in the IMDb bottom 100. This is far superior than that garbage. The puns were better here. Some puns were misses. Parts where I cringed were like the scene that may portray rape. One should hope that the audience is educated enough and not easily influenced by what they watch on TV. If someone does get influenced in the belief that 'rape is okay' from an animated movie about food items then he was a pervert to begin with. It is similar to the belief that 'women wearing provocative clothes are asking for it' and those who think that are medieval misogynists.The other part was the bagel and falafel scene (but that is just me, I maybe slightly homophobic), the orgy at the climax and most importantly gum.If Stephen Hawking gets offended by it then I would take his side on the lawsuit. A perfect description as per wiki is 'Gum, a Stephen Hawking-esque bubble gum wad in a high-tech wheelchair'. However it is a perfect metaphor for his condition, like being chewed up and spit out by the gods. If it weren't for that I would be giving this a ten but that is my opinion. So it is okay if people hate it or think it is a ten.",8,2,3,8 February 2017
"Hail, Caesar!"," Hail, Rubish!
","Great visuals mean nothing if the acting is so wooden. The superb cast has been utilized for nothing but their names. The cowboy's lassoing was probably the only highlight of the whole movie. Channing Tatum danced quite alright but he was no Gene Kelly. It felt like a Wes Anderson movie but somehow this technique works in his movies alone. There is no discernible plot. What I could make out is that Clooney's character gets kidnapped by the communist section of the film industry and the demand for money was not really out of desperation as they have plenty of money. To Clooney some stupid explanation was given and the delusional Clooney accepts it and after being released repeats all that his captors have told him to Brolin, the Hollywood fixer who just slaps him to snap him out of it. I guess what everyone making this movie needed was a good slap like that to snap them out of this. Scarlett's character has a baby with a father who left and a single mum is going to result in a career-ending situation. Somehow Tatum was part of the communist film industry and the cowboy out of the blue seeing him with a briefcase which could mean anything really, decides to pursue him. The cowboy rescues Clooney while all his kidnappers were giving a send-off to their beloved communist hero Tatum who was headed to Moscow in a submarine. The dog was funnier than anyone there. It abruptly ends like it was just another day in showbiz not to be mistaken with the movie being short as it dragged on painfully. Not a horrible movie but not a good one either. All effort was directed at the set but none on the script and dialogue.",5,2,2,9 March 2017
Black Panther," I like it but I am aware that it is not flawless
","First the good:
1. It was very entertaining. Action, Fantasy and even comedy. The joke about the silent shoes, 'sneakers' get it. It cracked me up. There is a reason I mentioned it but that is for the bad.
A second joke I have to mention is: T'challa or Black panther 'froze like an antelope in the headlights' when he went to fight his ex-girlfriend whom he still has feelings for. How true that is antelopes freezing in the headlights. Move you silly antelope out of the way scram. It gets annoying even.
2. A glimpse at the African culture but without mocking or glorifying it. It is almost neutral. Celebrations and jubilation everywhere. The accents was a nice touch though it has its pros and cons. Pro it is realistic, I mean you do not expect a Nigerian who lived in Nigeria to speak in an american accent even if it is a Hollywood movie.
3. The CGI was good unlike what other people tell you.
4. Rhinos in decorated armors. CGI I'm guessing.The bad: 
1.The goof about the shoes for silent shoes they surely made noise for later in the film, T'challa runs up a ramp wearing the sneakers and you could hear his footsteps.
2. The con to accents is stereotypes.
3. The conversation about using the Wakandan technology to help other nations was an idea shoved aside with some silly counterpoints about the tech going to the wrong hands. Yet they use the tech to save a 'white boy'. He is British. You are not fooling anybody Martin Freeman you are not American. Bragging about saving somebody is fine until you bring race into it. Even if it is a black person saying I'm going to save the 'white by'. The only reason we have the Everett K. Ross character is so that people cannot accuse a movie for 'black-washing'. Neither 'white-washing' or 'black-washing' is fair but neither is diversity hire because it does not seem to be about talent but the color of the skin. Things that fall somewhere in the middle:
1. However regarding the Wakandan tech they decide to reveal it which you would have found out had you stayed for the credits. Leaving a Marvel movie without watching the credits who is going to make that mistake again. 'What can a nation of farmers offer the rest of the world?' some UN official asks condescendingly and the Wakandan's smirk. It is kind of silly but funny as well. 
2. Also in the credits there is a hint of Infinity War Bucky Barnes, the Winter Soldier appears. It would have been better if Black Panther was a stand-alone film but maybe less people would have watched it then. Who knows.
3. The Marvel franchise pitfalls plague this movie as well with its very typical story lines and I do not know what to think of it. Lately though some movies are breaking out of that (Thor Agnarok )so there is still hope yet.",7,0,2,12 May 2018
The Deer Hunter," Sorry but the movie was too long
",I don't know about everybody else but to me the movie was too long. The first hour was slow but it was pointed out by others that this was intentional so as to show a sudden contrast to the intense war scene. The war scene was the best part of the movie and probably even ahead of its time but then we come back to after the war and it was slow once again. Also this time it was gloomy compared to how cheerful it was before the war. I do appreciate the comparison and it was almost poetic like a play but this was not what I was looking for in this movie. However even if this was what I was looking for it would still be too long. Red stain on the wedding dress and maybe the folks were very cheerful before the war sets the tone for what was about to come. On an entirely unrelated note the main character hunts deer for sport hence the deer hunter. In my opinion not worthy of being in the top 250 at least not anymore as there are lots of well deserved movies waiting to take its place.,5,5,9,3 August 2015
John Wick: Chapter 2," This a time it is more personal still
","After all that has happened in the previous movie John's car is a wreck. Not to worry a friend of his will get it fixed by Christmas 2030? Meanwhile John gets an offer he should not refuse. Yet he does because he is John Wick. The person who wanted to hire him gets mad and destroys the only other remaining thing that John holds dear. John Deere. He he I just could not resist. Yeah you guessed he is out for revenge, AGAIN. Expectations were low.This time however the action gets bizarre and it works in the movie's favor. No nudity but this woman (House wrecker's sister, John Wick's contract) wanted to die in her own way of her own choosing. She strips and gets in a Jacuzzi. She cuts her arteries or veins, whatever but John shoots her anyway. He wanted the credit though he did not want to do any killing to begin with. Her bodyguard (Common) tries to avenge her. AGAIN they get caught fighting in the Continental but you know the rules. NO FIGHTING in the Continental. Surprisingly this movie is slightly better than its predecessor.",6,3,7,26 May 2017
Incredibles 2," Average-ables
","It has a few good moments. They explore the babies superpowers which is kinda cool. The plot is a rehash of the first movie with the roles reversed. Mrs. Incredible (Elastigirl) is out being a superhero fighting crimes and all that while Mr. Incredible is Mr. Mom. She is the poster girl for feminism maybe. Unlike Mr. Incredible in the first one she is not sneaking around training or fighting as it would be too similar I guess. Superheroes crime-fighting is still illegal but Elastigirl will change that by representing superheroes as she saves lives with finesse while Mr. Incredible is messy with high property damage. Lives are more important than property dumba$$. The old company that deals with PR for superheroes, damage control and other such activities is being shut down by the government but rich eccentric brother and sister duo try starting the venture anew with this poster girl plan. The brother has a Ted Cruz vibe about him. Screenslave, the villain is like Killgrave from season 1 of Jessica Jones. Hypnotism through computer screens is the MO. I predicted that Screenslave was one of the rich eccentric siblings. The first half hour and last half hour are decent but the first movie was better. Hopefully in the next sequel, if there will be one the 'superheroes are illegal' charade is done with and there is some kind of Infinity War.",6,0,1,28 September 2018
Rockstar," Good music, bad movie
","It started off alright. People: fans, goons and police chasing after him all over town. Then he comes on stage, Jordan or Janardhan orJJ played by Ranbir as a rockstar. We have a flashback. He gets this idea that love, heartbreak, pain and misery is what he needs to become a Rockstar not only talent. At first it felt like a joke, satirizing the music industry but its not as he pursues a girl from the hot chick list, Heer played by Nargis. Like a typical Bollywood movie he is very persistent but his motives were not typical so at least right? He eventually confesses that he does not like her but not because she is not beautiful so they become friends.
They have this bucket list thing going on. They go to a theater playing a blue film. You know the weird soft-core porn type, 'Jungly something' I cannot remember the second word in the title and I guess not really worth remembering. She wore a hoody pretending to be a guy. They leave early and the joke they make there is very cringy in a bad way. Heer says that they should have stayed longer. JJ says 'if they found out that you were a girl they would have raped you'. Her reply was then it would have been 'Jungly something 2'. Seriously who wrote this shit. There is nothing wrong in watching porn or glorifying it like a joke about JJ's conservatism or his surprise reaction and that was funny but they went too far with this joke. It was glorifying rape as well. Like seriously. The bachelor party he was looking away like an immature baby. Guys are not like that yet somehow in indian movies the hero is the innocent guy and the heroine has to tell him its okay. Heer gets married and they still manage to hang around like old buddies. Her husband really let her hang around JJ. Okay he did because he trusted her. She exploited his trust and commits adultery. Way to go movie, back to the old days, married women should not be left alone with another man or it will always end badly is what you are saying not me. It is implied that they made love but atleast the lip-lock scene was a real one not the fake silly stuff like in the older moves. Okay fine he would leave and they shall never talk of this again as she requests him to do the right thing because she was done. He breaks into her house alarms buzzing everywhere. So they arrest him while she faints as she was having some health problems. It is not explained clearly really. All I gather is it has something to do with her bone marrow and low blood count. He returns to India and gets jailed for breaking and entering and assault for an undetermined period. This gave him more publicity. He got his chance and uses his pain to make good music. He is so rude to everyone all the time and does not appreciate the opportunity. Rockstars actually appreciate it in my opinion. He comes into Heer's life again as her condition gets worse because Heer's sister insists that he visit her in the hospital. She dies. It makes his music even better but he wants to quit now. The end. 
Frustrating second half, average first half good chemistry between the leads, good music but bad plot.",5,0,1,22 February 2018
