Requiem for a Dream," Feel-good film of the year!
","I rented this film today and when I took it out of the box, I noticed that it wasn't re-wound.  Now that I've watched it, I completely understand why. The last person who rented it was so happy about not being a junkie, they simply couldn't be bothered to look for the remote.  Too busy turning cartwheels.All 'drug movies' that are intended to be taken seriously are exactly the same.  The only thing that differs is the direction.  Each one has to be more stylishly directed than the next, and why?  Because it's the same story.  Maybe someone needs to make a drug movie that doesn't end horribly, where the junkies are all incredibly successful at the end and fall in love and have kids and live happily ever after.Great performances and everything, but if you've seen one drug movie you have literally seen them all.",Null,0,1,16 June 2001
