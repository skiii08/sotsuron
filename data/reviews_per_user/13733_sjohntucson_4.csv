Requiem for a Dream," Hard to watch, hard to stop watching
","I seem to be on a drug movie binge tonight. I just posted some comments about 'Spun,' which has some obvious similarities with this movie. I think this movie has more universal appeal, though, and for good reasons. To me, this is simply a fantastic film, and I'd recommend it to anyone.The four main characters are each likable, or at least very sympathetic, and we become very drawn in to their situations. And so, when things start to go horribly, horribly wrong, it does become painful to watch. Yet, one can't turn away, and I don't think it's just the 'auto-wreck you gotta look at' effect. Here's my theory: I have a good friend whose life has been, for several years, tragedy after tragedy, stupid mistake after stupid mistake, and unbelievably (literally!) bad luck after unbelievably bad luck. I keep thinking (as does he) that things can't get any worse. And then, they get worse. And I keep waiting for that point where his life finally turns around and good things start happening, but they don't. I can't turn my back on him, because he is in fact a good friend, has been there for me when I needed him, and I care for him very much. That's exactly the feeling I have for the characters in this movie. I want so badly for things to turn around for them, but things don't turn around, but I can't give up on them because I've become attached. And things do get truly awful for them.A lot has been said for the style and, in particular, the fast-edits and the symbolic shorthand sequences indicating that a character is taking his/her particular drug. Some think they are gimmicky; I on the other hand feel that they are integral to the story, and are a pretty good way of describing the immediate effects of the drug and the emotional undercurrents (as distinct from the drug effects) that one feels when one is taking a drug (been there, done that, ruined my life thank you very much).I give this movie 10/10. Admittedly I have an agenda here, but I really want all the kids in my life to see this movie before they encounter drugs for real. I don't know if it would stop them, but at least I'd feel like they knew what the worst-case scenarios were, and that they were making semi-informed decisions.",10,0,1,21 September 2003
Monty Python's Life of Brian," All you need to know about religion!
","Brian was born in the manger next door to that OTHER manger. In his thirties, he gets mixed up in a gang of terrorists / freedom fighters to impress a girl. This leads, through a slapstick set of coincidences, to his being taken as a messiah. THE messiah. As the multitude stalks him, we see how random individuals' bizarre perceptions turn into dogma.OK, sorry. It's really really funny, and brilliantly satirizes not only the birth of Christianity, but also nationalism, authority, mindless conformity, sterile tradition ('Why can't women go to the stoning, Mum?' 'Because it is WRITTEN, that's why!'), political correctness, Star Wars, speech impediments, joke names, and the inevitability of missing the point ('I think he said, 'Blessed are the cheesemakers!''). Whereas MP's Holy Grail was superbly silly, this movie is stunningly subversive.One of my fondest teenage memories is gleefully crossing the picket lines the Fundamentalists staged in front of the Tulsa theater where my friends and I first saw this movie, then saw it again every week for four weeks in a row. The distinction between the movie and real life blurred to the extent that we didn't even bother dropping acid after the first viewing. The poor drug never stood a chance against the surrealness of it all.My favorite sequence: Brian: 'You're all individuals!' Multitude (in unison): 'Yes, we're all individuals!' Brian: 'You're all different!' Multitude: 'Yes, we're all different' Single member of the multitude (sheepishly): 'I'm not.'Ten out of five stars! My favorite movie ever!",10,0,2,27 February 2003
Brokeback Mountain," You got to stand it
","I drove to Scottsdale to see this today, about a 120 mile drive. That's right, you guessed it, I had some pretty high expectations.Turns out they were pretty reasonable expectations, too. The reviews praising Heath Ledger's and Michelle Williams performances, the cinematography, the source material, McMurtry's & Ossana's screenplay, and Lee's direction, were all pretty much on the money. And although I've read a lot of reviews that say Jake G's performance didn't, couldn't compare to Ledger's, I disagree. Jake's performance was just as perfect, although his character isn't the focus so much as Ledger's.I am pretty devastated still, though I got home many hours ago. The story keeps playing in my head, and, like many great works of art, the movie seems to keep taking 'different shapes' in my head in the aftermath. Honestly, I couldn't even tell you at this point whether the overall effect is particularly gay-positive without arguing against myself in an hour.I'm not even convinced that the climactic event isn't a little ambiguous (I got the same sense when I read the short story, too). But while it seems to cause (to me) the meaning of the movie to kind of flicker between two different messages, the final effect is the same either way. Like I said, devastating. I didn't see a single dry eye coming out of the theater when it was over. I can't really explain what I mean without revealing too much, but you'll know what I mean when you see it. And, boy howdy, you have to see this. To be honest, I don't know if the straight folk are gonna dig this as much as I did; a lot of the story could have come from my own life, and the lives of my friends. But even if it doesn't resonate as powerfully with you as with me, it'll surely give you a sense of how toxic a closeted life can be, while simultaneously pointing out the stakes of not being closeted.",10,27,33,19 December 2005
A Clockwork Orange," I was back all right!
","I saw this again last night on BBC America. I'd forgotten just how visually fascinating this was. I saw Clockwork Orange for the first time in about 78-79, tripping my brains out. Needless to say, it burned itself into my brain immediately, and watching it now, almost a quarter century later, it still feels as fresh and shocking as it did then.Just commenting on the surface aspects here, there's plenty that's been said here about the story itself (plot, characters, morals, etc), but for me the real treat has always been just the look of the movie, the cinematography and the soundtrack. Some of my favorite scenes from this perspective are: The montage when Alex is in his bedroom listening to Beethoven, with the chorus-line of crucified Jesuses; the scene where he kills the 'cat woman;' and of course the opening scene in the milk bar, with Alex staring down the camera.",10,1,2,3 November 2002
