The Rock," Wow!
","I just don't believe it. Ever first time I have been in London, England (of course I had to go to the cinema), and the movie I saw was one of the best... Just to make it simple, my Mom didn't understand one word of The Rock, but she enjoyed it as much as I did... Really likeable characters, stunning, intense action, a story I could believe. Needed an action movie like this, for a long time.",10,3,3,26 October 2001
