Requiem for a Dream," Still is the best picture I've ever seen.
","I'm sitting here, in September 2014, thinking of my all-time favourite movies, and Requiem for A Dream has been there, on top of my list, for 14 years.I have never felt such raw emotion watching a movie; before and after Requiem's release. I went through all possible kinds of emotions watching this masterpiece. I've seen it probably 20 times over the years and the result is always the same. It's a jaw-dropping experience. I remember hearing the soundtrack the first time in 2000, while watching the movie, and I couldn't believe how perfect it was added to the 3 seasons of the movie. The soundtrack has been used many times since then for commercials, trailers and whatnot, but to me, this is the Requiem's soundtrack.The 4 main acting performances in the movie are perfection. I connected with all of them. The cinematography, the editing and the directing are still amongst the best I've ever seen. The movie doesn't age at all. I always wondered why it wasn't up for many Oscars? (Picture, Director, Cinematography, Screenplay, Supp Actor and Supp Actress). I guess not many people saw the movie when it came out in the Fall of 2000.This is movie perfection, an experience I will never forget, one of the best movies ever made, a tragic story but yet so close to what many humans must go through in their regular lives.If someone out there has not seen this masterpiece, I envy you. I wish I could re-live the 2 hours I went through the first time I saw this. A moment I will never forget. A must-have in any movie collection. A movie for the cinephiles.",10,2,3,4 September 2014
