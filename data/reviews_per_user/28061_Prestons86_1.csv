It," Take It
","I went to see this movie with 5 friends not knowing what to expect. we took 2 little kids with us who had previously seen the original movie 'IT'. We were worried that the movie might be to scary. surprisingly enough the movie wasn't scary at all, BUT IT WAS VERY CREEPY. I'm guessing that the vibe they were going for. Clowns naturally aren't scary things but they are extremely creepy to see. great movie i recommend it.",8,3,7,13 September 2017
