The Blair Witch Project," Overexposed
","[Warning: May Contain Spoilers]It must be said that there is only so much one can do with a limited budget. Of course there are exceptions. For example, 'The Last Night at The Alamo,' is probably the best example of the truly independent low budget film.'The Blair Witch Project,' was certainly hyped and received a vast audience bored with Hollywood's crackerjack horror output. This movie certainly is different. Still though, it lacks what good film needs. Namely, the basics. Story, plot, character development, intrigue, and a slew of other basics are glossed over or are simply missing. To be fair though, these elements were not attempted, at least traditionally.This film most reminds me of George Lucas' original 'THX-1138' (not the one with Duvall). It has a studentesque quality about it. I am left wondering what could be done with a remake. Of course, there will be one, but the cat is already out of the bag. Originality will be missing in the next installment.As cultural phenomenon, I can only guess at its success. The characters speak in a pseudo cool youth speak, in which the F word is noun, adjective, and verb,often in the same paragraph. Well, that may be fine if you live in the vernacular.  However, my own experience lends me to believe that only Eddie Murphy has met that task (i.e. 'Life').While I can't recommend this film, I will admit that my skin did tingle on occasion. As such, I give it 5 of 10.",4,0,8,8 December 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Story Tellers Are Not Athletes
","[WARNING:  May Contain Spoilers.]If you've ever had a favorite athlete in whatever sport, you've probably noticed that you never tire of his or her remarkable mastery of their sport. Whether its a figure skater, running back, or basketball player, the jumps, runs, and dunks never get old.  Alas, the same is not true for the storyteller.Repetition in story telling is a death knell.  I'm very familiar  with the Star Wars universe as a setting.  I don't have a problem with that.  Once you create a fictional universe, you must operate within the confines of your creation to tell other stories which reside in that universe.  However, you don't have to tell the same story with different characters.I was absolutely shocked to see young Skywalker blowing up the Trade Federation ship by destroying its power supply with a lucky shot from the inside.  Echoes of the past passed through my mind.  'Luke, what's wrong, you turned off your targeting computer?'  See my point?  Well, at least Anakin had the help of a friendly droid named, R2D2.  Oh yeah, so did Luke. Good lord George, is the force with the cute little droids too?  Do they have little midichlorians running around in their non cells?Did you also notice that in The Phantom Menace we have a young royal in trouble.  I think I've seen that one before with Princess Leia.  Well this time it is Queen Amidalia, approximately the same age as Leia was in Star Wars IV.  I also found it odd that Queen Amidalia was the elected leader of Naboo.  A seventeen year old elected queen?  Hmmmm.  This just doesn't make sense.  Who elected her?The absolute worst aspect of this film is with Anakin himself.  Acting is a serious profession.  I've never seen an eight or nine year old pull it off with any sense of believability.  To be sure, the script doomed Anakin even further.  The attack on the Droid control ship contains three separate instances within ten minutes in which Anakin's lines include an elongated, 'Ooooops.'  This is both sloppy writing and horrendous editing.  It doesn't get much better though.  When the ship spins or rocks, Lucas gives us a comic shot of Anakin yelling, 'whoooooaaa.'  Once might be forgiven, but he does it again and again.Don't ask me how Anakin penetrates the shield.  This is never explained.  To be sure, the grown up pilots couldn't do it.There are good points to this movie, however.  Ewan McGregor did  an outstanding job mastering the accent and mannerisms of Alec Guinnes' Obi Wan Kenobi.  In addition, Liam Neeson delivers well  as the individualistic and somewhat weary defender of the universe, Qui Gon Jinn.In addition, I thought the supporting cast performed well.  Although, they had limited roles, Terrence Stamp as Chancellor Valorum and Hugh Quarshie as Captain Panaka performed  exceptionally well.  I feel that Panaka will be back in the next installment.  In fact, I'll bet he becomes Boba Fett.  Ian McDiarmid is probably the most memorable of all of the supporting roles.  He plays Palpatine remarkably.And finally, the shining triumph of the film;  the swashbuckling at the climax.  Simply, it is the finest sword fight scene ever to make it to the screen.  Darth Maul was played to perfection through facial expressions. How unique to give life to a character without lines.  Bottom line is that it worked.  Ray Park is not a physically imposing fellow.  Darth Maul was. Unfortunately, three different action sequences are occurring during the Sith v. Jedi action, and Lucas constantly cuts from the gem of the movie, to show Gungans and Anakin accidentally blast their separate ways to victory.In the end, this installment falls far short of being a good film.  The genre is quickly becoming the self fulfilling prophecy that Lucas told us it always was, a 'Saturday Serial.' I guess I'm feeling generous.  5 out of 10.",6,0,9,14 April 2000
The English Patient," Beautiful Film Destroyed by Banal Characters
","It's hard to give a rot for this film.  Consider the characters and their actions.  First, the 'love affair' is suspect.  The torrid affair borders more on infatuation and selfish indulgence, punctuated by a bizarre scene in the midst of a Red Cross, Christmas dinner for soldiers.  Such offensive behavior barely bothers the paramours as they so dimly illuminate later on, 'we are the real countries.'Perhaps this belief is why Fienes' character was adroit at treason. Numbskulls are supposed to believe that Count Laszlo was forced to deal with the Germans in order to keep his promise with his gal (the real country). Not so fast.  He had his chance with the British first.  Not only did he seal his own fate by extremely strange behavior, we never get to see him commit treason with the Germans.  We are just told about it.  I posit that scenes with the Count selling out the British for a plane would properly trash his character.The Count's love interest is an educated yet indifferent figure.   She marries a lifelong friend and suffers (shazam) an indifferent marriage. She reads poetry well and states her views.  This is nice window dressing but no more.  Despite cheating on a husband she doesn't love and surviving his murder- suicide attempt, she remains stoic to the end.  Barf!  Plane crashes hurt, especially the ones you don't walk away from.  She didn't.  Her lover, the Count had to carry her a long way, while  she labored through dignified comments ad nauseum.And what about that husband of hers?  Despite the fact that he gets weird and attempts to kill the love triangle (literally), we don't see him devolve into suicidal depression, it just happens.Now on to the other characters which reside years after the tragedy of the love triangle.  First we tackle the Indian Army officer.  His initial entry into the film is accompanied by his no nonsense style in which he makes it clear he is not interested in the English Patient's nurse.  He changes his mind in a nice scene in which he lays out a candle trail to his heart. This really worked.  Unfortunately, by the end of the film, it all ends up, 'wham bam, thank you ma'am.'  Of course they will always have their church in which he gave her an art lesson.  This really makes no sense to me except to validate one night stands as legitimate love affairs.The nurse herself is the most disappointing character.  She is distraught after seeing a friend die.  This triggers something within her that demands that she take a hiatus from the war to care for the English Patient.  She works really hard and does well for him while contending with various interlopers.  The really frightening scene is how she emotionally euthanizes her ward upon his request.  She would never have done this at the outset. However, after learning about his situation, she wisely decides that he is better off dead.  I'm sure utilitarians are satisfied by these events.  As for me, I'm appalled.The only benevolent character seems to be the man sans thumbs.  His dark search which doesn't involve redemption actually receives it.  He is a triumphant figure who trades in darkness for good.  However, this man's limited involvement in the film isn't enough to balance the rest.A summation of this film is to compare it to a trashy drugstore novel. The characters wear pretty clothes, engage in 'forbidden' sex, and suffer tragic ends.  Romance fulfilled.",4,3,14,9 August 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," The Most Offensive Movie Ever
","Political Correctness has met its match, and it is South Park:  Bigger, Longer and Uncut.  It takes a lot to shock this author, but Parker and Stone have managed to do it.  Of course I was laughing my a. . er buns off for the whole movie.This makes Animal House look like a boy scout instructional video.  Not for the meek.",9,5,12,1 July 1999
Elizabeth," Artsy Approach Plays Fast and Loose with Facts
","Moderately entertaining film recounts Elizabeth's consolidation on power. The factual errors are glaring but will not be noticed by most viewers.In addition, Elizabeth's crackdown which occurs late in the film borrows heavily from Coppola's, 'The Godfather.'",6,0,6,28 June 1999
Armageddon," Way Too Much Action Dooms Interesting Screenplay
","[WARNING:  This review may contain 'spoilers.']Given that the Earth has but mere days to exist, NASA elects to go with a crew of Texas roughnecks to save the day.  Actually, NASA doesn't really have a choice.  They need a team of drillers who can operate anywhere, in the harshest of conditions.  Engineers, astronauts, and pilots are very skilled and knowledgeable in their fields, but they don't know diddly about drilling.This really was a wonderful opportunity to highlight the abilities of unsung men who have technical capabilities, rarely highlighted in Hollywood films. It is also interesting to see how NASA wrangles with the construction crews' various legal, medical, and psychological problems.  For example, 'Bear,' the biggest and strongest of the bunch jumps into an impromptu flex after being told by a NASA egghead how awful his cholesterol is.  Its pretty clear that if these boys are going to save the world, the planners are going to have to take a back seat to knowledge and knowhow.If the film had stuck with this premise it would have scored big.  Alas, 'Armageddon' trades in its refreshing approach and adopts the cheesy, stale, over the top, Hollywood sanctioned industry explosion as its plot mover. What a waste!  Not ten minutes goes buy in the second half of this movie, in which something isn't bursting apart, a la, 'Independence Day.'  By the time the ending comes around and one of the crew elects to do a heroic act, it winds up meaningless.  Too much anxiety has already been built up and torn down again, by mindless explosions in outer space.This movie suffers the same fate as 'The Phantom Menace.'  When you shoot for the 12 year old boy in the audience you will almost always get his attention.  However, Hollywood should ask itself a question.  Is that tried and true formula for box office success worth it in the long run?  Is it really worth tossing good screenplays to the wind for the sake of slow motion , computer generated effects?  If this film did not have the explosions every minute, it would have scored high.  As it is, I give it a generous five out of ten.",5,0,7,3 October 1999
Doctor Zhivago," Pasternak's Classic Becomes a Classic Film
","How would kind hearted souls react to totalitarian confiscation of not only life, liberty, but happiness as well?  I think somehow in the same manner that Dr. Zhivago did.It is painful to watch this man's soul be slowly steamrolled by communist dogma.  In the state's eternal method of redistributing not only wealth but happiness, we see a noir figure churned to nothingness.Pasternak chose the vehicle of an extra-marital affair to highlight the flicker of individualism.  The line within the film, 'all russians are poets,' can clearly be extrapolated to mean, 'all men are poets.'Ordinarily, one would be troubled by Zhivago's selfish indulgence with Lara, since he has a family of his own.  However, this illicit affair is his small rebellion against a world gone mad with ideology.I would rate this movie a perfect ten if it were not for the ending which cast a glow on the old Soviet Union in the form of a triumphant dam.  Built on the corpses of so many wrecked lives, was it really worth it?  I think not.  A nine is a nice vote of confidence.",9,0,6,16 September 1999
JFK," This is America's 'Triumph des Willens'
","[WARNING:  May Contain Spoilers]Oliver Stone gives Leni Riefenstahl a run for her money for making the most insidious film of all time.  Both filmmakers are brilliantly talented.  Its what they do with their talent that is disgraceful.'JFK' is a propaganda piece.  This genre, however expertly crafted, always suffers from its roots in advocacy.  This is why  some wartime flicks seem agonizingly corny.What separates 'JFK' from most of its fellow propaganda films is the views and interests which it wishes to advance.Namely, 'JFK' advances the idea that Lyndon Johnson aided by the  Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Dallas Police Department, the Pentagon, Bethesda Naval Hospital, Parkland Hospital, the City of Dallas, the John Birch Society, communists, fascists, cuban left wingers, cuban right wingers,  mobsters of various political and personal bents, nightclub owners, topless dancers, reporters both national and local, and various others sought to snuff out President Kennedy and cover it up for infinity.The vehicle for advancing this claptrap comes in the form of the intrepid and dogmatic District Attorney for New Orleans, Mr. Jim Garrison played by Kevin Costner.  Costner's portrayal of Mr. Garrison may be right on the money.  He spends most of the film completely absorbed with the idea of a conspiracy.  In addition, he makes very lengthy pronouncements throughout the film consisting mostly of bombast and grandiose theories from the fringe.  Mr. Garrison's staff are played up as 'yes men' dupes (until the end, when we see some rebellion).  I thought it quite amusing that one of the deputy D.A.'s is played by the comedian, Wayne Knight, better known as Newman on Seinfeld.  Now  that is apropos.Normally, this film should be considered simply trash.  However,  'JFK' has become some sort of an educational tool.  It shows up  in high schools around the country every year to 'teach' our kids.  Of course it also shows up in our living rooms so the intellectually lazy can take a three hour course on President Kennedy's assassination.  Despite the outrage of traditional historians (whom I suppose are part of the plot themselves), the majority of viewers still buy the preposterous premise, hook, line, and sinker.  This moves 'JFK' beyond the category of trash, and places it within the company of 'Triumph des Willens'  for its evil.",1,28,87,7 March 2000
A Clockwork Orange," A Parable for the Sinister Reason of Man
","[WARNING:  This May Contain Spoilers.]This film looks to the future in all of its '70's splendor.  Of course the future in the eyes of the artists of the '70's was sufficiently bleaker than actual events would allow.  This is kind of a common ground from forward looking films of the time.  It doesn't take away from the moral of the story.The narrator is indeed a very bad boy.  It is hard to have any positive feelings for him.  However, Kubrick does an interesting  thing halfway through the film.  By illustrating the regimen of the supposed benevolence of society, Kubrick rehabilitates the main character just enough to challenge society itself.The evil of the individual is replaced by the blind evil of misguided social experimentation on the perpetrator.  The viewer  is left disgusted with both entities.  This is a clever film and a controversial one at the same time. I find it slightly overrated and give it an 8 out of 10 for its brashness.",8,0,10,10 January 2000
The Thin Red Line," The Battle of Guadalcanal is Not in This Film
","[WARNING:  A movie review cannot be written without 'spoilers.'   You have been warned.  As extra comment, IMDB can shove their blacklist.]This film makes the predictable dead end by attempting an artsy war film. War is hell.  It has been said that this film depicts war through the eyes of poets and writers.  Consider this, would you want to peer at poetry through the eyes of an eighteen year old G.I?The viewer is in trouble from the start, as the film maker attempts to craft, 'another world.'  This world is the idyllic realm of native people who live their care free life while technological nations attempt to blow themselves apart.  This cliche is so tired that it amazes me how often it is repeated, with the usual disastrous effects.The 'War is Bad' theme is propped up and replayed throughout the entire film.  The vehicle is a plodding narrative which produces a sleep like stupor for the viewer.  Of course, one can overcome this affect if we take the high moral ground the film attempts to achieve and claim it as our own. Interestingly enough, this tact is risk free and much easier than the difficulties that the subjects of the film are presented with.  Nice try, but I'm not biting.Sanctimonious humbug is not my strong suite.  The fact is Guadalcanal was beyond nasty.  However, there was a reason U.S. forces were there in strength and Japanese troops defended the island so desperately.  These reasons did not involve a sadistic attempt to 'blow the world up,' as the gasbag film makers would have you believe.Despite these flaws which are fatal to the film, Nick Nolte and John Cusack deliver strong performances which are to be commended.  However, they are not enough to save the film.",4,7,19,16 August 1999
High Fidelity," Cusack's Shtick is Wearing Thin
","WARNING:  Spoilers ahead.John Cusack has been portraying the nice, cool, yet loveless underdog, for almost twenty years.  Enough!Yes, these films work on a basic level.  After all, they are formula tested and proven.  However, I'm enraged when I see such films garner wide critical acclaim. The reason is because the storyline of these films are the result of dumpster diving for old material.Let's take a look at Mr. Cusack's similar films.  They include; 'The Sure Thing (1985),' 'Better Off Dead (1987),' and 'Say Anything (1989).' I am sure I am leaving some out but I think you get the drift.  John Cusack has made a good living out of being the nice guy seeking a nice girl.'High Fidelity' is no different except to say that even at thirty something, nice guys have trouble meeting nice girls.  Perhaps so.  However, I find it troubling to grant such movies some deep meaning mandate.  This is not 'Dr. Zhivago.'  Peppering the film with pop culture and anti-pop culture music references may be 'hip' with some generation x-ers, who seem to love this kind of crap (see also 'The Wedding Singer'), but it does have real limitations, which Mr. Cusack reached long ago.  Alas, a paycheck is still a paycheck, and folks are still driven into delirium by the bozo formula. The lonely Cusack in the night rain might drive you nuts if you notice how abused it is in this movie.I was impressed by Jack Black's performance as the die hard devotee to the cause of 'music appreciation.'  The viewer see's that Black's character, Barry, is going to love the eighties and the past to the death.  Barry is meant to be the juxtaposition of Cusack's character.  While Barry is content to wallow in the past, Cusack seeks to gain a future.  Unfortunately, Barry is funnier and more believable.  This is because Cusack's real dilemma is not whether or not he will look to the future or the past.  Rather, he only worries if he will find true love.  I could care less if he ever does or doesn't and neither should you.The bottom line is that this film is hopefully the end of the John Cusack unloved puppy series.  Jack Black delivered well and he has a bright future in film.  I rate this rot at three out of ten.",3,0,7,27 March 2001
