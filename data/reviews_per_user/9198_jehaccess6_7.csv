Ghost," Terrific performances in a sweet movie.
","This movie really was a great follow-up role for Patrick Swayze. I was intrigued by his performance in 'Dirty Dancing' and wondered how he would approach this very different role. I was pleasantly surprised by Patrick's ability to shift gears from dancer/actor to straight actor. His portrayal of a man's eternal love for his soul-mate was very convincing. His portrayal of an investment banker was not as strong. That huge mane of curly hair did not seem to fit into the image of a corporate team player.The strength of the film was in the chemistry between Patrick 'Sam' and Whoopi Goldberg 'Oda Mae'. These two performers played off each other so flawlessly, it was magic. It made for a strong comedic theme in a performer not noted for his comedy skills. On second thought, perhaps it was much more Whoopi than Patrick.The chemistry between Patrick and Demi Moore 'Molly' was not as strong. They had flashes of excellence between more mundane moments. The scene where 'Molly' making pottery on a wheel turned into an amorous encounter was a very sweet moment.The performance of Tony Goldwyn as best friend/traitor 'Carl' was extremely creepy and convincing. When he attempted to take advantage of grieving 'Molly' I first suspected that the plot would involve 'Carl' having 'Sam' murdered so that he could move in on 'Molly'. That did not exactly happen, but it seemed 'Carl' would have enjoyed this as an additional bonus to the money he wanted so badly he killed for it.The finale made the film. Even the hardest heart melted at the love and loss experienced by 'Sam'. He showed how beautiful and loving 'Sam' really was. He had bonded with 'Oda Mae' too and it no doubt made her decide to become a better person from his example.",9,4,5,2 December 2007
Dirty Dancing," Dirty Dancing and early '60s American Mores
","I grew up in the era depicted in the film. I was about a year younger than the 17 of the character 'Baby'. My working-class family definitely moved in the same circles as the busboy 'Billy' and the dance instructor 'Johnny Castle'. The world of the Catskills resorts was not even within my awareness at the time.I must say that I did not see the film in its era of release. It is only somewhat by accident that I picked up the VHS tape on a flea market table with the thought that not much was lost if the film failed to hold my interest. What a revelation!! I have never gone in for dance films before, but I have changed my tune!I was mesmerized by Jennifer Grey from the instant the opening credits gave way to the actual narrative. She was so innocent and compelling in the character of 'Baby', I was stunned to learn she was actually 27 when the film was made!Two main points stick with me about the film:1. The rich, professional Jewish clientèle of 'Kellermans' considered themselves the social betters of the mixture of the white working-class, Latinos, and Blacks that staffed the lower rungs of the employee pecking order. Here were the descendants of penniless Jewish immigrants from two or three generations back now lording it over less prosperous young people with a generally longer history in this country.2. The character 'Baby' was able to rise above this attitude and relate to the lives of the little people in a huge way. She was willing to jeopardize her whole future by providing an alibi for 'Johnny' when he was accused of theft.What man could fail to fall for a woman of such character combined with surpassing grace and beauty? No doubt there would be a rocky road ahead for the two lovers from such diverse backgrounds and values. But with their great love, their union would survive and prosper.Sadly, in reality Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey had major difficulty working together. It never came across in the film, but that is probably why no reuniting sequel was ever made.I have watched this film about 50 times in two weeks and always catch some new detail I missed or misunderstood in previous viewings. Definitely, the best film I have ever watched!",10,0,0,28 November 2007
Legends of the Fall," Cinematography Great, Julia Ormond Stunning, Screenplay Terrible.
","WalMart had the DVD in the clearance bin, so I took a chance on this film. Thank God the film is on DVD so I can jump around to the good parts and avoid all the horrible filler material.First of all, I loved the scenery that formed the film background. Who would not enjoy this splendid area, some of the most beautiful in the whole world? The Ludlow home was very rustic and inviting. The perfect backdrop for the film.Then there was the idea of an Army officer becoming so disgusted with the abuse of native peoples that he turned his back on his military career. He attempted to redress the injustices by his incorporation of the old Cree warrior One-Stab into his household. Three sons are born to him before his wife flees back to the comforts of civilization. All this came out as promising material for a great film.Then a young Tristan Ludlow seeks out a sleeping grizzly bear and picks a fight. Amazingly, he survives with only superficial slash marks on his arm. For an animal that can easily split a large log with one swipe of his claws, that is a pathetic response to the provocation endured. The film goes downhill from there.The patriarch, Colonel Ludlow, is apparently content to live without the comfort of a wife in an isolated ranch in Montana. His cultured wife is too refined to stay with him in self-imposed exile. That would seem grounds for divorce even in the conservative America in the early 1900s. What kind of mother would abandon her young sons to allow her to enjoy a more comfortable life? Perhaps that explains why Tristan turned out so badly.The youngest of three sons, Samuel, returns home from college in Massachusetts with a stunning fiancé, Susannah Fincannon, who apparently has no close living relatives. How this woman managed to support herself and move in fairly privileged social circles is left a mystery. A woman in that era would find it difficult to survive outside the support of a family. Samuel is such a nonentity that one is forced to conclude that his fiancé latched on to him in desperation for a husband to support her continued social position.The actor Henry Thomas, who played Samuel, is six years younger than Julia Ormond who played Susannah. The age difference is so glaring as to be ludicrous. This pairing is obviously doomed from the start. I instantly knew that the plot would swiftly remove Samuel to make room for Tristan, Brad Pitt, to move in on the tempting Susannah.Susannah is actually an admirable person, for the most part. She tries to fit in to the frontier lifestyle and to bond with the people who work for the Ludlows on the ranch. She does her best to become a useful member of the family, able to help out with ranch work when needed. What sticks for me is the protracted engagement to Samuel. She is moved in to the home of her fiancée, the family welcomes her presence. Why is she not going through with the wedding? The answer is two words, Tristan Ludlow.Susannah has fallen for older brother Tristan, even from a distance. Samuel senses her growing infatuation and attempts to justify his claim to manhood by an absurd decision to join the British Army and fight in World War I. The two older brothers join him with lesser degrees of conviction. All the noble reasons for this decision are really covers for Samuel's feelings of inadequacy. The three brothers set out for nearby Canada, where they can join the British Army.The war kills Samuel, wounds elder brother Alfred, and drives Tristan nuts. The two surviving brothers are released from their service for reasons left unclear. I am sure many soldiers at the front would have liked to simply walk away from the carnage. Alfred comes home and tries to woo Susannah, with her firm rejection. She waits a few months for Tristan to eventually come home.Tristan wastes no time. He brutally takes advantage of Susannah's feelings and begins an affair with her. She hopes for a pregnancy to force Tristan to marry her, but that is not to be. How the two love birds could conduct their affair in Susannah's bedroom with no notice from the rest of the family is not explained.Tristan eventually can endure normality no longer. He abandons his home and the woman who loves him to roam the world to 'find himself'. I tuned out of the plot right there. The family goes through numerous disasters before righting itself somewhat after Alfred takes over from the incapacitated patriarch. Susannah marries Alfred as a poor second choice and eventually kills herself in anguish after Tristan returns and marries the young daughter of the hired hand.The movie shone in the first few minutes and went steadily downhill from there. I fail to notice all the riches other comments seem to find. Perhaps I was seeking more noble behavior in the Tristan character to make me enjoy the film.",6,0,2,4 July 2008
Meet Joe Black," Stunning Insight Into TheTrue Meaning of Life.
","I caught the last 5 minutes of this film on television and was mesmerized. I looked up Anthony Hopkins' film biography on IMDb to learn the name of the film in order to see it in entirety. What a fruitful effort! Watching the DVD was such a treat I watched it at least 5 times in a week!The film is long enough and delves into the characters' lives in such detail that we become old friends with most of the major characters by the end of the 3 hours. Only the despicable Drew character is thankfully left a mystery.Bill Parrish is a giant both in business and in his family life. He is so powerful that the lives of all his family revolve around him. His 2 daughters adore him and depend on him emotionally, even his married older daughter Allison. This unhealthy dependence partly springs from the loss of their mother at a young age. Bill loved his wife so much that he never remarried, focusing all his energies on his business and his daughters.Bill has always wished for a son and subconsciously seeks to fulfill this desire by supporting his top aide and prospective son-in-law Drew. Younger daughter Susan senses Bill's desire for her to marry Drew and continue the dynasty, since her career as a physician is not going to involve Bill's business empire. Susan seems willing to marry Drew to please her father, but her lukewarm romance troubles Bill. He wants Susan to have all the passion and joy he experienced in his marriage and this will likely never happen with Drew. Susan probably senses that beneath the pleasing exterior, Drew is a monster.Allison has always played second fiddle to Susan. She has always wanted to be the apple of Daddy's eye, to little effect. She has suffered mental problems and a raging inferiority complex. She marries Quince, a man obviously in far over his head trying to function as a board member of Parrish Communications. Quince is easily manipulated into providing the information necessary for Drew to topple Bill from his position as board chairman. Quince has the redeeming virtue of a good heart and a willingness to face his failure and seek Bill's forgiveness.Allison tries to win daddy's favor by organizing an over-the-top 65th birthday party for him. Bill detests the concept, but grudgingly tolerates the project to keep peace with Allison. Allison continually pesters Bill to make trivial decisions about aspects of the upcoming party while he is consumed with anxiety about his business and his impending death. Eventually Allison senses the need to make peace with her father and accepts that she will have to settle for second place in his affections.Susan visits a coffee shop near her hospital and has a fateful encounter with a compelling young man who has all the qualities she finds lacking in Drew. She is strongly drawn to the young man and is shaken to the core by her instant attraction. She is both thrilled and appalled by the encounter that threatens to disrupt her life. She starts to see Drew in an unfavorable light in comparison to the nameless young man. Susan turns a corner on the way to work and fails to see the young man killed by oncoming traffic as he lingers in crossing the street, distracted with thoughts of her.Death, wanting to interact on the human plane with Bill Parrish finds the young man the perfect vessel to inhabit to accomplish his purpose. Death heals the young man's injuries and utilizes the body to visit Bill and act as a quasi-member of the Parrish family. Death has developed few social skills over the eons and acts in innocent outrage of social norms. Bill is forced to tolerate a great deal of bad behavior from his visitor in order to live a few more days. Death is given a name, Joe Black, in order to make social intercourse possible.Susan meets the mysterious young man later the same day. She attends a family dinner, only to find him sitting at the table with her family. He announces that he will be staying at the Parrish townhouse and Bill dares not challenge the decision.Joe Black is strangely different from the man in the coffee shop. He is socially awkward, mysterious, powerful, and dangerous behind his pleasant conversation. Joe's relationship with Bill is outrageous and unexplained. Susan sees her father yield to Joe on many issues where he would never submit to anyone else. Susan has several encounters with Joe that enhance her attraction to him while upsetting her on another level. He refuses to explain his relationship with her father or what purpose lies behind his visit.Eventually, Drew explodes in rage at Joe's influence on Bill and Susan and ends his relationship with Susan. Susan has another encounter with Joe that ends in her bedroom. It is amusing to see Joe reacting to all the instinctive responses of his body with great confusion. Susan has to make the first move to get things rolling. Joe's awkward responses to Susan's advances are met with great amusement and tolerance. The story hints that Joe proves an apt pupil in the arts of love.The story ends with Drew's horrific plan defeated and Bill saying goodbye to his family. He bravely marches out to meet his fated end. Death yields control of the young man's body and Joe returns to the man he was in the coffee shop. Joe and Susan pick up where they left off and walk hand in hand to a life together.This film is so rich in meaning and character development, it will take me many more viewings to see it all. A prospect I look forward to with delight. A huge THANK YOU to all those artists involved in the creation of this gem!",10,2,5,22 March 2008
For Love of the Game," Effective Hybrid of Chick Flick / Sportsmovie
","I really began to resonate when the beautiful Basil Poledoris score opened this film. The man is a musical genius, in my humble opinion. He can make a real turkey of a film into a much more enjoyable experience. In this case, he only enhanced an already great film.I approached this film with low expectations. After 'Water World', 'The Postman', and the perfectly dreadful 'Robin Hood : Prince of Thieves', I wondered how Kevin Costner could appear before the camera with a straight face. Fortunatly, he found the perfect script, supporting players, and director to redeem his career.'Billy Chapel', Kevin's character, is totally absorbed in his career as a professional Baseball pitcher. Billy has excelled at Baseball all his life. Unfortunately, he has mostly failed as a human being. Here is a man nearing 40 years old who has never established a stable relationship with any woman. He has been content to trade on his fame and wealth to enjoy the party scene whenever the loneliness of his existence threatens to enter his awareness. Somehow, the example of his father and mother having a loving and stable marriage never seems to penetrate his awareness as a desirable state for himself.We see that the closest relationships 'Billy' has are with his team mates 'Gus Sinski', 'Davis Birch', and the owner of his Baseball Team. Billy feels such loyalty to his team that he passes up more lucrative opportunities with other teams to remain a Detroit Tiger. When 'Davis Birch' succumbs to the lure of a higher salary with the hated rival New York Yankees, Billy feels great anguish at the loss of a friendship of a man who will now become a rival player.Sadly, the Detroit Tiger franchise is saddled with less than stellar players. The owner is unable to compete financially with the richer teams to hold onto his better players. Billy's buddy, 'Gus Sinski', is probably playing his last season. He is hitting too poorly and runs too slowly to keep his position on the team. Only Billy's intervention with the manager is able to keep 'Gus' on the starting lineup for the last game of the season. The owner of the team realizes that the only way the Tigers will become competitive is to sell the team to a corporate enterprise with pockets deep enough to pay competitive player salaries.Kelly Preston played a magnificent role as 'Jane Aubrey'. Here is a woman of obviously humble roots who has clawed her way into the fringes of the high fashion world. She starts out as a pregnant girl of 16 abandoned by the boy who fathered her child. Somehow she has been able to build a career and a home for her child. But mother and daughter both still long for a relationship with the right man to complete their lives. There is no mention of 'Jane' having any parents or siblings, so that part of her life is left blank in the film.'Jane' meets 'Billy' when he stops to offer help when her car breaks down on an expressway while she is starting out of town on a vacation. She resists his help at first, but he persists and invites her to attend a baseball game as his guest. 'Jane' is deeply attracted to 'Billy' and winds up sleeping with him on the first date. 'Jane' agrees to meet 'Billy' on his next trip to New York, but is deeply conflicted about the relationship. 'Billy' and 'Jane' continue to meet whenever his team is playing in New York.There is no mention of 'Jane's' daughter 'Heather' until late in the film. 'Heather' had a more prominent role in deleted scenes that would have made more sense being retained in the film. How 'Jane' could be going on a vacation in her car without 'Heather' is difficult to understand. 'Jane' visits 'Billy' in Florida training camp, again without 'Heather'.'Jane' and 'Billy' fall out after she encounters him with another woman in his apartment at training camp. 'Jane' finally contacts 'Billy' in desperation after 'Heather' runs away from home after a fight with 'Jane'. 'Billy' looks up 'Heather' in Boston and brings her home to her mother in New York. 'Billy' and 'Jane' reconcile and 'Billy' starts to develop a real affection and relationship with 'Heather'.I watched the film in disbelief at the stupidity and insensitivity of 'Billy Chapel'. On the few occasions when he actually took the time to connect emotionally with 'Jane' her face showed such angelic love and devotion, any fool would have worked like crazy to keep the magic alive. Instead he often stepped on her heart in his self-centered way. 'Billy' had to hit rock bottom emotionally before he would face the fact that he needed a woman's love to fill his empty heart. Why any woman would retain any desire to stay around after being hurt so often is hard to understand.The baseball portion of the film is very beautiful. We see how 'Billy' and his team of second-raters rise to the occasion to play the perfect game. These players on a team with a losing season determine that they will go out on a blaze of glory. On sheer willpower they frustrate the godlike Yankees in their quest to clinch victory in their division. The Yankees will have one more opportunity and will no doubt claim the prize. A heart warming scene in the film was when the rabid Yankee fans were forced to acknowledge the magnificent accomplishment of the Tigers in defeating their team. They knew that the ultimate victory would soon be theirs anyway.I suppose I love this film because it shows the power of the human spirit and that there is hope for even the most stunted personality to grow to maturity and find happiness.",10,0,1,4 May 2008
The Holiday," Two Romances For The Price Of One.
","I picked out the DVD in haste before the video rental store closed. My first choice in rentals firmly in hand, I hastily snagged a backup. Well, the first choice was a dud, but this film was actually quite pleasant. I usually get an insight to the female perspective on romance from female directors like Nancy Meyers, this one did not disappoint.The plot of this film is covered countless times in these comments, so a rehash here is redundant. My reactions to the film are as follows: The plot got me to thinking about how much reality about Hollywood relationships reached the screen. Does everyone in Hollywood really carry on as in this film? When you think about the plot a bit, it starts to seem incestuous; a Hollywood film about Hollywood. There must be a whole lot of misery concealed behind that over-the-top architecture in Bel Air. Oh well, filming more than half the project in Hollywood reduces the expenses of location shooting significantly.I enjoyed the Kate Winslett Iris character much better than the Cameron Diaz character Amanda. Iris had only had one real romance in her life, one sided to be sure. Amanda had wandered from man to man, never willing to commit herself wholly and eventually pushing away everyone she was supposed to get close to. No wonder the men found this unsatisfactory and started looking elsewhere for a better relationship. We see this pattern repeated in Amanda's relationship with the Jude Law character Graham.Shallow Amanda meets drunk hunk Graham at her door late at night and immediately suggests they jump into bed together. From this unfortunate decision, somehow a more rational relationship is forged as Amanda fights off her worst fears and actually allows a man into her heart.Iris is pleasantly shocked and delighted by her experiences in Los Angeles and dives into the experience with gusto. She is kind and thoughtful to everyone she meets, especially her 90 year old neighbor man. Iris' kindness extends to new acquaintance, the Jack Black character Miles. Iris lends support and comfort to Miles as his romantic relationship to an unfaithful girlfriend dissolves. Of course, you can see immediately that Iris and Miles are destined to fall in love.Amanda is shocked and delighted to meet the two adorable little daughters of widower Graham. They take an immediate liking to Amanda and set about worming their way into her heart. It is the attraction to these children that gives Amanda the courage to take the terrifying step of actually allowing herself to fall in love.The film closes with the two couples bonding around a Christmas tree in Graham's living room. Two women who just met are going to become much closer as sisters-in-law. The two girls are gaining a mother and an uncle. How the practical problems of carrying on the respective careers of the parties is left unresolved, but they will find a way.One thing really bothered me in the film. Amanda is shown driving Iris' car in two scenes. Nowhere on the cottage property is any provision for parking the car. Iris seems to commute to and from work by train and walk home from the train stop in the nearby village. So where does Amanda get the car?Of course this film is all fluff, but I never cared because all the major players carry it off so well. I watch this film often and I never fail to enjoy this visit to four people I have grown to care about.",7,2,4,13 July 2008
The Blind Side," Best Bullock Effort Ever!
","Leigh Anne Tuohy (Bullock) was a force of nature in this film. Her husband and family tread very warily in her presence. You could see her husband, Sean Tuohy (Tim McGraw), carefully considering what supportive position would earn the most favor before he dared give it utterance. Only her son S J was able to bend her will to his by the most artful of manipulation. That boy had her down cold, after mastering his mother, college football coaches were putty in his hands.Michael Oher was a homeless black teenager barely coping with survival. He was a very sensitive young man despite his enormous size and strength. He only kept his sanity by blocking out almost all the horrid things in his past. This withdrawal made him very difficult to read by everyone he encountered. Strangers seeing his great physical prowess and knowing something of his past assumed the worst about his character.Leigh Anne had no clue about the nature of the strange young man she gave shelter one night. Since he was so different, she decided to let him reveal his character by asking him how he felt about his situation and how he wanted to be treated. Michael slowly started coming out of his shell under Leigh Anne's relentless questioning.S J was the first family member to bond with Michael. That was enough to encourage Leigh Anne to make the effort for the rest of the family. Once Leigh Anne had accepted Michael, no force on Earth was going to prevent her success in turning his life around. Michael really would have been destroyed by his awful situation if not for the intervention of Leigh Anne!I have not felt so uplifted by a film in ages. There really are some very wonderful people in this world. Once in a while the forces of darkness are cheated of a victim. I know, I know, the film glosses over or ignores a great deal to fit its time frame. Still, the effort is superb and well worth watching again and again.",9,0,2,16 August 2010
