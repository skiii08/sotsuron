Insidious: Chapter 2," Do not bother seeing this film, wait for RedBox Release
","Most people in the theater were laughing, I was cracking up as well. The first Insidious installment was okay, but there was something contrived about this sequel. Nothing was really scary, the acting was predictable, sub par, the story-line very weak, silly...I would just honestly say that don't waste your money, I feel sorry for my fianc√© for the 21$ she spent. Red Box worthy only, The Conjuring was a scary movie, Insidious 2 was for little boys and girls who think communicating with the dead using Yahtzee like word dice and talking through tin cans and a string with ghosts is scary.One thing is for certain, any movie will have it's moments, things that make you jump, but whatever moments of terror are dealt you are immediately pulled back into the reality that you can't take any of this seriously.",1,6,13,14 September 2013
