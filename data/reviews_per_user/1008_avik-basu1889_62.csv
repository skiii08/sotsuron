The Lobster," Profundity in its most absurd form !!!
","Prior to watching this, I had already seen Lanthimos' 'Dogtooth'. So I was already somewhat familiar with his unconventional style of storytelling and I knew that 'The Lobster' was also going to be something weird. This is Lanthimos' first film in English. The screenplay is written by Lanthimos and his screen writing collaborator Efthymis Filippou. Just like 'Dogtooth', the story creates this new world with new rules and regulations. Many reviewers have stated that the film is set in a dystopian future, but for me, this is a parallel universe. Lanthimos creates an alternate reality to satirise our own reality. This is a film of two halves. In the first half, he satirises the way relationships and marriage are viewed by society. In this film, if anyone is not in a genuine loving relationship with someone, he/she is supposed to be discriminated against. It is a commentary on our own society where so many people see marriage and relationships as the shortcut to happiness and it underlines how single middle aged people are deemed as 'losers' in our world. The film in its own absurd way shows how in this desperation to find a partner and be an ideal couple in the eyes of society, people tend to pretend to be someone else in order to find the perfect connection. By doing this they trade their own individuality for a fake and unstable relationship.But the masterstroke in the writing and direction comes in the second half when the film starts undercutting it's own message and satire. The second half of the film shows how a society that completely rejects relationships can never be ideal too because this is also nothing short of dictatorship which smothers human choice. Lanthimos shows that no matter what, human beings still have a general need for companionship and relationship. So in a nutshell in the whole movie, Lanthimos and Filippou is neither advocating against relationships nor for them, all they are doing is making a statement against totalitarianism and upholding the individual's choice and his/her individualism which should never be compromised just to show everyone that you're with someone. The first half of the film critiques the establishment and the second half critiques uncontrolled anti-establishment tendencies. The ideal state of existence for Lanthimos and Filippou is the grey area that lies in the middle of these two extreme schools of thoughts, an area which encourages choice and I think the last shot of the film perfectly epitomises this idea. With the last shot, Lanthimos puts the eventual outcome of the story in the hands of the viewers and celebrates choice.Lanthimos' direction and style of storytelling is extremely deadpan. The deadpan style of storytelling and line delivery by the actors actual adds to the comedy to the whole premise and elevates the absurdness that surrounds every inch of the film and makes it extremely funny. There are scenes where I couldn't help but laugh out loud. But then very quickly he will change the mood with something graphic and disturbing. Just like 'Dogtooth', Lanthimos makes the viewer laugh at the absurdness on show, but then feel a little troubled for finding something which should be disturbing, very funny. Although 'The Lobster' shares the darkly funny satirical tones of 'Dogtooth' as well as its criticism of totalitarianism, but the visual style of the two films are very different. While 'Dogtooth' was made to look intentionally bleak and visually dull, 'The Lobster' is shot beautifully. The shots in the hotel as well as in the forest really have a visual appeal to them. Lanthimos' framing and shot composition is meticulous. The deadpan nature of the film reminded me of Kubrick's 'A Clockwork Orange' to some extent and the absurdness of Lanthimos' formalism is certainly reminiscent of Bu√±uel's works like 'Viridiana' and 'Belle de Jour'.The acting remains very deadpan and non-demonstrative throughout the film. Colin Farrell is brilliant and really the best part of the film. Even with his deadpan demeanour, he manages to express his loneliness, his awkwardness and also manages to be very funny at the same time. Rachel Weisz's character is really likable. I really believed the connection between her and Farrell.'The Lobster' is the kind of film that can't be recommended to everyone due to its idiosyncrasies. It is profound, but weird. It is funny, but disturbing. I loved the way in which the themes and ideas were explored here. This film made me want to explore other films that Lanthimos has made in the past. I will also be gladly waiting for his subsequent films in the future.",9,0,3,12 August 2016
Vertigo," In my eyes, Hitchcock's ultimate masterpiece !!!
","First of all, while reviewing this film I have to say that 'Vertigo' requires multiple viewings. When I watched it for the first time, I liked it, but it didn't blow me away. But on subsequent viewings, not only has it amazed me with the implicit richness, it is now my favourite Hitchcock film, which is saying a lot as I adore films like 'Rear Window', 'Psycho', 'The Birds',etc. The screenplay written by Samuel A. Taylor, Alec Coppel and Maxwell Anderson in close collaboration with Hitchcock is based on the French crime novel 'The Living and the Dead' is brilliant and takes the film to the brink of greatness, but what pushes it over the edge and takes it into the masterpiece territory is Hitchcock's direction. Hitchcock's approach to filmmaking had a lot to do with what he called 'Pure Cinema' which involved using masterful technique and direction to put the viewer in the shoes of the protagonist and put them in the moment and make them feel the tension and the suspense. The explicit generally was more prominent than the implicit themes and subtexts. But Vertigo is different because there are endless things happening underneath and it is unbelievably layered and nuanced and deep because of Hitchcock's direction if the viewer is looking for the themes and from experience I think multiple viewings is required for that.A connection between 'Vertigo' and 'Rear Window' can be based in Hitchcock's fascination with the human tendency of voyeurism. The first part of the film involves Scottie following Madeleine obsessively which is very similar to Jeff's obsession with the goings-on in the apartment in front of his window in 'Rear Window'. A connection between 'Vertigo' and 'Psycho' can be drawn but it's far more tangential and less direct. The second half of 'Vertigo' becomes a full blown character study which has extremely disturbing subtexts which is also the case in 'Psycho' as it also has very disturbing subtexts, however 'Vertigo' in my eyes has more depth and layers.Possible interpretations of the film:Firstly it can be seen as a damning indictment of some men's obsession with their idea of female beauty and fantasies and their tendency to force their fantasies on their partners. Secondly it can be seen as an indirect indictment of the obsession of Hollywood studios with casting beautiful women. In a snide way Hitchcock might be taking the mickey out of his own self as he himself was well known for casting a lot of attractive blonde women in the majority of his films.Thirdly this can be seen as a film which makes references to the Greek myth of 'Orpheus and Eurydice'. Scottie clearly falls madly in love with Madeleine which gradually becomes an obsession. This obsession gets the better of him. When he meets Judy, his obsession with Madeleine overwhelms his thoughts and his unending attempts to relive the sensation of being with Madeleine through Julie ultimately makes him lose 'Madeleine' again which is very similar to the story of Orpheus. Hitchcock himself has talked about the disturbing elements of necrophilia that 'Vertigo' contains. This film also is a statement on the power of fiction be it in any form like books, cinema, etc. There is a particular scene towards the beginning of the film where Gavin Elster has the conversation with Scottie which makes Scottie interested in pursuing the case. The blocking in the scene is interesting. There is a particular moment where Elster is standing on what looks like an elevated stage while clearly lying and Scottie is watching him while sitting on a chair just like an audience member.'Vertigo' can also be seen as a work on masculinity and male insecurity. I have heard reviews where the bell tower has been described as a phallic symbol. When Scottie fails to 'save' Madeleine due to his vertigo, he succumbs to feelings of despair and uselessness. He views his inability to save her due to his vertigo as a blot on his manhood. But when he figures out that he has been tricked, his rage come to the surface. He forcibly takes Judy back to the bell tower in an attempt to overcome his fear of heights and in a thematic sense 'regain' his manhood.All the themes of the script work because Hitchcock through his masterful direction allows them to work. The way Hitchcock uses colour motifs in the film is breathtaking. He uses the colour red to signify Scottie's obsession. He uses green to signify something ghostly or ethereal which is why Madeleine/Judy is seen wearing green dresses. There are two beautiful profile shots of Kim Novak once as Madeleine and the other as Judy. They beautifully juxtapose each other. The first one shows Madeleine's profile shot with the blazing red colour all around it to signify the arousal of Scottie's obsession. The second one is in Judy's apartment where we see Judy's side face which is engulfed in darkness with the neon green light all around her face showing how Judy is invisible to Scottie. All he sees is the green light which reminds him of the ghostly Madeleine. The uninterrupted 360 degree kissing shot where Scottie in his mind actually recreates the past climaxing in the still of Scottie and Judy kissing in front of the green light resulting in a rebirth of the spirit of Madeleine in Scottie's head is one of the greatest shots in film history and an example of Hitchcock's masterful vision.James Stewart plays an uncharacteristic role as Scottie. Scottie is nowhere near the lovable and kind character that he was generally known for playing. Kim Novak is absolutely brilliant playing the two roles of Madeleine and Judy. She brings in subtlety and perfectly manages to make both the characters distinct.'Vertigo's thematic depth, rich use of colour and Hitchcock's masterful storytelling make it a masterpiece.",10,4,6,14 April 2016
Alien 3," A fitting end to a great sci-fi series !!! (Resurrection doesn't exist in my world)
","'Alien¬≥' is the 3rd film in the Alien film franchise and undoubtedly the one which is hated by fans the most. It is directed by David Fincher and the screenplay written by David Giler, Walter Hill and Larry Ferguson is based on a story idea by Vincent Ward. After escaping from LV-426, the escape vessel carrying Ripley crashes onto a remote ore refinery named Fiorina 'Fury' 161 which is also a penal colony. It is soon established that the reason for the crash of the escape vehicle could be an alien stowaway which could have landed with her on this colony. The prisoners on this colony who embraced an apocalyptic, millenarian version of Christianity initially are cold towards Ripley, but gradually they grasp the danger that confronts them and they start working with Ripley for surviving.After watching Alien¬≥, I have come to the conclusion that the only reason why fans and some critics criticised and hated this film so much was because after Cameron's 'Aliens', they were expecting more of the same and weren't ready for something so bleak, so nihilistic and so radically different. I am aware that the production for this film was chaotic and it was so stressful for David Fincher, that he ended up walking away after the shooting ended without supervising the post-production and he has in the subsequent years disowned the film citing reasons of unrestricted studio interference. But even after acknowledging all that, I was really impressed by this film. Yes it has some flaws with the plot, but overall it is my 2nd favourite in the series after Scott's original.My review will be entirely based on the Assembly Cut. The first and foremost thing that I noticed was that this was a throwback to the smaller,more contained filmmaking of the first film departing from the bigger, grander, blockbuster elements employed by Cameron. We again revert back to one single Xenomorph and the element of claustrophobia instead of the army and war elements of 'Aliens'. This is not an action film, instead it is atmospheric horror with clear and apparent biblical themes and Fincher successfully managed to distinguish this from earlier films. The great aspect of the entire Alien series is that every film distinguishes itself from the other and creates its own identity instead of wallowing in repetition like so many other fan-loved film franchises are guilty of.The film instantly kills off Newt and Hicks and introduces us to ragged, dirty prisoners and criminals in a penal colony and these reasons have been upheld by many fans to justify their hate for the film. But I admire the fact that they decided to go for such a risky move which could have easily annoyed the fans which it clearly did in the end. I like this story decision because another film with Ripley, Newt and Hicks at the forefront would have only led to more of the same and we would have had another shoot em'up Aliens-esque blockbuster. Instead we got something more. The film has religious themes at its backbone. 'Alien¬≥' in a way is about the second coming of Christ. The film is about redemption. All the prisoners on Fiorina 'Fury' 161 are murderers and rapists who have embraced religion and they're waiting for God's judgement, redemption and a new beginning. Ripley comes into this prison and gradually becomes the person that allows the prisoners achieve some sort of redemption. She becomes the Christ figure in the prison. I think this is the film in the series where Sigourney Weaver gives her best performance as Ripley. She is at her absolute lowest here and conveys the mental struggle perfectly through her expressions as well as her physical appearance. Ripley's death in the end was I believe the last nail in the coffin which completely alienated 'Alien¬≥' from most of the fan base. But for me it is the perfect end for a fantastic, strong character. In a true Christ-like way she sacrifices herself to save humanity from evil and from humanity's own sins of greed. All the actors in the film give great performances alongside Sigourney Weaver, but I'll give a special mention to Charles S. Dutton and Charles Dance. Although this was Fincher's first film, but you can clearly see his stamp and his artistic vision all over the film. He creates this brilliantly dark and bleak atmosphere. I noticed his trademark fast editing strategies which always makes his films extremely fast paced even when they are very long. The film looks fantastic just like every other David Fincher film. There certainly are some flaws here. I thought the screenplay once or twice went into clich√© territory and became a little unreasonable. I also thought the CGI used for the wide angle shots of the Xenomorph did not work at all. But even after considering these flaws, I was still impressed by 'Alien¬≥' and for me this film marks the spiritual ending of Ripley's amazing story. 'Alien:Resurrection' for me is an unnecessary film that was made just to earn some money. I conclude by saying 'Alien¬≥' is a very impressive film with great themes and great characters and in my opinion it gets hated and panned by fans and critics for all the wrong reasons.",8,3,5,2 January 2016
10 Cloverfield Lane," Very well directed, but cheapened by clear corporate interference !!!
","What I liked:1. The Direction - Based on this film, I have to say Dan Trachtenberg has an inherent sense of crafty visual storytelling that really impressed me. I always find a filmmaker's ability to express feelings and emotions and also proceed the narrative with visuals instead of dialogue, extremely remarkable. I found that flavour of Hitchcock- esque 'pure cinema' in '10 Cloverfield Lane'. The opening to this film is wordless and we don't get to hear a single word out of the protagonist Michelle's mouth till about the 9th or 10th minute mark, but the director manages to say a lot during that sequence with just the camera. Trachtenberg's use of camera movement is fluent and expressive(reminded me of the camera movements in 'Don't Breathe'), his ability to generate and raise the tension in specific scenes is uncanny and he also has the ability to get exceptional performances out of the actors.2. The acting - We get marvellous performances from Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Goodman. Winstead completely pulls off the task of portraying a character who goes through a spiritual and behavioral transformation over the course of the film and Goodman is exceptional as the wild card who remains a mystery throughout the film.3. The script(for the most part) - The film's core concept, though not new or original, is still refreshing due to Trachtenberg's handling of the material. An undeniable claustrophobia, paranoia and dilemma is always lurking around the corner in every scene in '10 Cloverfield Lane'.What I did not like:THE LAST 15 MINUTES - '10 Cloverfield Lane' is a clear example of a film that can be divided into 2 parts - the part made by a filmmaker which is approximately the first 85 minutes and the part made by a studio committee which is approximately the last 15 minutes. In order to make a direct connection with the original 'Cloverfield' film which was merely tangential up to that point, the film takes a turn for the absurd and does exactly what it managed to avoid till then, which is become bloated and ridiculous in an attempt to emulate big budget, effects heavy, commercial studio films that the world gets inundated with. We get this laughably over the top action sequence which betrays the restraint that ornamented the rest of the film. The final sequence genuinely did put me off to some extent and came close to souring some of the goodwill of the film in my mind. The concept of Michelle outgrowing her fears and making a bold decision could have been executed in a much more subtle fashion which would've been appropriate for the film as a whole.Although the finale is disgustingly plastic and hollow, I can't ignore Dan Trachtenberg's brilliant visual storytelling, tension building and crafty handling of the film and I also can't ignore the remarkable performances on show and it is these elements that make the film worth a recommendation.",7,0,0,21 June 2017
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," A charming. heart-wrenching fairy tale set in the late 20th century !!!
","'E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial' directed by Steven Spielberg is one of the most renowned and well known films in the said director's oeuvre. It stars young Henry Thomas, Drew Barrymore, Robert MacNaughton and Dee Wallace as the mother of the three kids played by the aforementioned child actors. The film's plot follows Henry Thomas' character Elliot in particular. One fine evening, he discovers an alien being. The film is about Elliot and his siblings falling in love and befriending this alien and hiding it from their mother and all other adults including the government who are clearly aware that an alien being has landed in the area.I have a love-hate relationship with Steven Spielberg. I am ready to acknowledge the fact that he is arguably one of the most important filmmakers of all time in terms of making films that become box office behemoths. He has always been the box office's darling. I have always loved some of his grittier and personal films like 'Schindler's List' or 'Saving Private Ryan'. But there are other films in his filmography that make me cringe due to the saccharine nature of the direction and the style of storytelling. Some of his other big blockbusters like 'Indiana Jones' or 'Jurassic World' are examples of films that I can appreciate for the technical achievements, but I haven't been able to love them. 'E.T.' is an example of an aberration when it comes to my impression of a Spielberg film. It has all the schmaltz and John Williams' sweeping music that has made me cringe in some of his other films, but those are exactly the aspects I believe that work in this film because 'E.T.' at its basic level is a fairy tale.Like many other fairy tales, the storyline to this film is strictly from the point of view of the kids. This is a story that can't be told without the presence of the kids. In other fairy tales like 'The Wizard of Oz' or 'Alice in Wonderland', etc., the protagonist goes to a new, magical and wondrous world where the story is set. But in 'E.T.' it is the magical element of an extra-terrestrial being which is brought to Elliot's home. Without a shadow of a doubt, 'E.T.' is a children's film. But the best children's films are those that impress adults too. I watched this for the first time as an adult in my twenties and it blew me away. Not just because of the fact that it's adorable, but also because of the rich subtext. It is revealed very early that Elliot's parents have recently separated and clearly Elliot feels the absence of his father. This film is about Elliot, Gertie and Michael trying to avoid premature adulthood and maturity which can be inevitable when your parents separate or divorce when you're very young. The alien being itself represents Elliot's innocence. Elliot's attempt to hide E.T. from the adults epitomises his attempt to restore his innocence and his childish spirit in the face of great mental trauma brought on by his parent's separation. The E.T. is also going through emotional problems because of being separated from the other aliens. There is no real villain in the film except adulthood. Spielberg made an artistic and thematic decision to not show any adult's face for a major part of the film except for the mother played by Dee Wallace. For the most part of the film we don't see adult faces, we only can listen to their incomprehensible science talks.The script written by Melissa Mathison in collaboration with Spielberg is beautiful. It tugs at your heart strings and embodies the magic and the wonder that comes along with a child's view of the world. This is undoubtedly one of Spielberg's most intimate films. There is some special effects work in the film, but they never drown the human element of the subject. The alien in the film becomes a real character instead of remaining a gimmick. John Williams pumps out his characteristic sweeping scores that works beautifully to complement the magical scenes in the film. The acting in the film is also great. Special mention has to go to Henry Thomas. He is adorable and makes it impossible for viewers to not fall completely in love with him. A good aspect about the writing is that the kids actually behave like kids for the majority of the film which is not the case in some Hollywood films. Having said that there is one particular monologue by Elliot that felt a bit mature for his age, but that is a minor nitpick.'E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial' is an intimate and magical fairy tale set in the 20th century. Spielberg consciously attempts to create a film that oozes childish innocence. Children will love the friendship between the alien and Elliot and also the fun chemistry between Elliot, Gertie and Michael. Adults and other perceptive viewers will appreciate the rich subtext of children trying to not get forced into growing up prematurely by sacrificing their childhood due to their parents' separation. 'E.T.' also makes you nostalgic about your childhood and taps the inner child in you. Along with 'Stand by Me', 'E.T.' is one of a select few films that will surely make viewers rue the loss of their childish innocence. Highly Recommended.",9,0,0,23 October 2015
Gravity," Spectacular celestial existentialism !!!!
","I have always been a fan of Alfonso Cuar√≥n. Whenever he directs a film, you can rest assured that the movie will not be superficial and will have deeper undertones.Gravity on the surface is a survival film about two astronauts(Bullock and Clooney) hopelessly stranded in the emptiness of space and their unrelenting attempts at an improbable survival. But it is thematically much deeper. Some people have criticised the film in the context of making errors related to the science of space missions and physics. But I will argue that this is actually not a film about space. The film is about letting go of the past no matter how tough it is to do that and getting reborn and starting your new life in a fresh manner. Some have said that the dialogues in the film are cheesy and a forced attempt to make the viewer have empathy for the characters. But for me, after considering the themes the film is dealing with, it seems those dialogue exchanges were essential and very relevant.The visuals in Gravity are groundbreaking. The cgi work in the film is probably the best I have ever seen in any film. Cuar√≥n successfully makes the viewer experience the horror of the situation that the characters find themselves in. The camera effortlessly at times seems to glide inside Sandra Bullock's helmet and we are shown what everything looks like from her perspective. The explosions in space are violent and scary,but also inaudible. Along with the larger than life,grand visuals, we also get some calm, serene and surreal imagery which are thematically brilliant. There is a lot of visual symbolism throughout the movie. Sandra Bullock is fantastic. This must have been a very challenging role and she knocks it out of the park. Clooney isn't given much to do, but his charm oozes in every scene he is a part of and his role is very important thematically. Cuar√≥n has made a film that is not only visually marvellous, but also thought provoking. After Y Tu Mam√° Tambi√©n and Children of Men. Gravity cements his position in my mind as one of the very best directors working today. On the surface, Gravity is an unforgettable visual spectacle and a thriller in space. But underneath its surface, it is a meditation on existentialism dealing with the challenge of overcoming a traumatic past and having the courage to start a new life.",10,3,5,9 December 2014
Fight Club," I am Jack's feeling of delight after watching Fight Club !!!!!
","Fight Club is one of those films that will not leave your thoughts hours and maybe even days after you've watched it. The feeling that you get after watching this movie is similar to being punched repeatedly and relentlessly for its entire 140 minutes length. David Fincher masterfully managed to create a perfect balance which makes this film an immensely visceral as well as a deeply intellectual watch.The main theme of Fight Club is freedom, or the lack of it. The script which is based on the novel by Chuck Palahniuk leaves no stone unturned and adopts an unapologetic approach to convey its message about how people in society are living trapped, compromised and unfulfilling lives and following the customs and norms which are generally considered 'normal'. The common human being is just a pathetic consumer with no identity and no personality. He is just satisfied with his material possessions and has no hesitations in allowing himself to be judged and trapped by society. The unnamed main character played by Edward Norton is one such character. He is a very average citizen with nothing to look forward to in his life. He has a boring job, no prospects and he is an insomniac. His strategy to temporarily escape the mundane nature of his life is attending self help groups in the evening. But suddenly one day, he meets a suave, sharp and stylish man named Tyler Durden(Brad Pitt) and his life changes completely. I think keeping Norton's character unnamed was brilliant as it shows that he is so average, his name becomes irrelevant and he can be any one of us.The script and the original novel have to be credited immensely, but not as much as David Fincher. This film is a masterpiece because of Fincher's direction and storytelling style. He has put his stamp on this film from start to end and it is impossible to not feel the presence of the director. It is extremely fast paced. If a 140 minutes long film never makes you feel bored for even a single second, then the director deserves a bow. The film is very stylish with its visuals and Fincher uses a lot of creativity with the cinematography. The whole movie looks intentionally dirty and dark. The film is also an example of tour de force editing.Now let's come to the acting. Norton is fantastic. He expertly portrays a man who is an insomniac and who is slowly collapsing mentally due to what he considers society's pressure. Helena Bonham Carter as the infamous Marla Singer is also breathtakingly good. She is wacky,funny and just plain weird. But if there is any actor that this film belongs to,it is certainly Brad Pitt. Charisma just oozes out of every inch of Tyler Durden's body. I can't think of Tyler Durden without visualising Brad Pitt wearing that red jacket with sunglasses. Durden's philosophy,though controversial, is undeniably thought provoking.When Fight Club first came out, it was negatively accepted by some critics who opined that a film as bloody and as violent as this, might attract copycat behaviour as the film also shows how people can be manipulated and influenced. While I completely understand that opinion, but I believe that cannot reduce the quality of the film itself.Fight Club is a must watch for every film lover and it is certainly one of David Fincher's best films as well as one of the very best films of the 90s.",10,0,2,24 November 2014
Memento," A Cerebral Cinematic Exercise !!!
","'Memento' is a film that takes you on a ride along with its protagonist who has a medical condition which makes him experience short term memory loss constantly. Nolan manages to make this ride incredibly special by using a very interesting and effective method, which was to tweak the screenplay in a way which will ensure that the viewer is allowed as much exposition as the protagonist himself. We are never allowed too much exposition and the result is a fascinating film that messes with the viewer, no matter how many times he/she chooses to watch it.First and foremost, Memento is a technical masterpiece. The non- linear screenplay, the editing, the cinematography and the direction of each and every scene is just pitch perfect. Nolan messes with the viewer in the same way that other characters mess with Lenny to take advantage of him and make use of his medical condition. 'Memento' demands constant and uninterrupted attention from the viewer, otherwise he/she could easily slip into a state of total confusion as the film is pretty much a puzzle which the viewer has to solve along with Lenny. The non- linear screenplay written by Christopher Nolan based on a short story written by his brother includes two major sections going side by side simultaneously. One section shown in black and white runs in chronological order, while the other section shown in colour runs in reverse order, both the sections move towards each other in time- line throughout the film. They meet right at the end to create a shocking climax to the film. A screenplay as complex as this would have been unimaginably difficult to conceive and execute, but Nolan astonishingly managed to write it and his directorial skills made the constant transitions from one section to the other absolutely seamless. It takes a lot of guts to write and direct a film like this, and when it's only your 2nd major film, the stakes get even higher and Nolan passed the test with flying colours.The major theme of the film is memory and the subjective(at times) nature of it. We all have certain memories, whose significance, meanings and implications change with time as we gain maturity or as we become aware of other things. In a way, this subjective nature of memory and the whole concept of choosing to remember certain aspects of an incident to derive a specific meaning out of it is dealt with in the most intense and cerebral way in this film. There are some reviews I have read where the reviewers have complained that maybe the non-linear,complex screenplay of the film is the only thing that keeps 'Memento' from being just a puzzle and a standard, ordinary revenge film. I have two arguments against that complaint. Firstly, this film had to have the complex screenplay as Nolan wanted the viewer to experience the same mental inadequacies that Lenny experiences and he wanted the viewer to feel lost at times during the film just like Lenny. Secondly, the film ends in a way which completely changed my perception of it. The ending makes the whole film a tangential metaphor for general existentialism. The film becomes much deeper by conveying that many people will believe in something just to make their lives worth living and give themselves a motivation to go on living in their quest for what they choose to believe, which can be very relevant from the angle of belief in religion and a higher power.Although Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano come up with good supporting performances, but 'Memento' is Guy Pearce's film. He drives the film forward from the beginning right till the end. He becomes the character Lenny and comes up with a brilliantly convincing performance. He juggles understatement with bursts of intensity beautifully to create the character on screen.'Memento' was the first Nolan masterpiece and this was the film that made his name. It is much deeper than some people think it is. No matter who you are and how many times you've watched this, 'Memento' will always find a way to keep you transfixed with its mystery and subtle reticence and it lingers in the mind for days and encourages discussions due to the openness of the storyline. It is always immensely re-watchable due to its style. This belongs to the Essential Viewing category.",10,1,3,27 July 2015
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Could have been something really special !!!
","Another year, another Star Wars film. Only this time it's a spin off, a story relevant in the overall context of the Star Wars saga, but it still doesn't directly fall in line with the Skywalker stories in the episodic films. Let's first talk about what I liked:First of all, I have to somewhat admire Disney and Gareth Edwards for trying to do something different. 'Rogue One' certainly does feel different from the other Star Wars films, both visually and tonally. The word 'dark' gets thrown around quite a lot nowadays, but this film certainly does have a darker edge to it in comparison to the others in the series, although the seriousness does get undercut from time to time whenever some teddy bear-like or frog- like creature appears on screen with a blaster in it's hand, but to be fair that has more to do with the inherent juvenile nature of the Star Wars universe as a whole than this film in particular. Even though there is some fan service in it, at least 'Rogue One' doesn't completely play out like nostalgia porn(like Force Awakens did at times) for viewers who only want to watch scenes that overtly rekindle their memories of childhood and their experiences of watching Star Wars.Secondly, the concept of the specific story that this particular film explores is interesting. A film that shows the process by which the rebels somehow steal the Death Star plans and thereby adds a bridge between the prequels and the original trilogy, is actually a creative idea.Thirdly, the action scenes in 'Rogue One' are really well executed. Gareth Edwards showed in 'Godzilla' that he has a knack of not only staging huge magnanimous action brilliantly but also making them look weirdly grounded. In 'Rogue One', Edwards skillfully juxtaposes the aerial space battles and shots of Starfighters colliding in space, with the battles being fought on the ground and the beach where the camera remains at eye level, giving the viewer a proper perspective of the chaos in motion. Gareth Edwards' visual style and flair in terms of action sequences is truly on show here.Having mentioned what I liked, I'll move on to what I didn't and that's the characters. There is not a single character in the entire film that I can say I truly connected with emotionally. Whenever there is a film involving a group of individuals coming together to accomplish a mission, an argument can be made that it is difficult to give depth to each and every character. But I think an easy solution for that is to focus on one or two of them and give them depth and layers while the rest of the group gets certain individual personalities and characteristics to enrich the squad. In Seven Samurai Kurosawa focused on Mifune and Shimura's character and their interactions with the other members of the group with their own distinctive personalities made Seven Samurai have thematic depth and emotional resonance apart from the badassness of the action scenes. The two main characters of Gyn Urso and Cassian Andor are really bland and are not given any scene to add any personality to the film. Gareth Edwards found it very difficult to get good performances out of his actors in 'Godzilla'. It's pretty much the same here. Unlike the charismatic Daisy Ridley in 'Force Awakens', Felicity Jones and the rest of the cast are extremely unmemorable and nothing about them jumps out as something we can hold onto to like them. The lack of personality and the lack of attachment to the characters actually ended up diminishing the satisfaction I derived from the climactic action scenes even though they were expertly executed. The somewhat romantic entanglement that the film hints towards between Urso and Andor is extremely unearned.'Rogue One' is a solid action film, it has great visuals, great action scenes and it tries to do something different with the Star Wars franchise. However the lack of any sort of character depth and emotional density taints the film's overall effect. It could have been something great, but in the end it's just good, but in a dispensable way.",6,0,0,28 March 2017
12 Monkeys," A sci-fi time travel film presented in a quintessentially Gilliam style !!!
","'Twelve Monkeys' is a sci-fi thriller directed by Terry Gilliam. It is based on the French sci-fi featurette 'La Jet√©e'. It stars Bruce Willis, Madeleine Stowe and Brad Pitt. Time travel is the basis of a major section of the literal storyline. After a virus wipes out 5 billion people in 1997, the remaining human population is forced to abandon the surface of the earth and somehow survive underground, while the animals reclaim control of the surface of the planet. Bruce Willis' character James Cole is picked as a volunteer who is going to be put in a time machine so that he can go back in time so that he can acquire some information about the virus at its unmutated state which would help the scientists in the present to come up with a cure. We are informed that a group named the 'Twelve Monkeys' was behind the spread of this virus in the first place.The script by David and Janet Peoples which is based on Chris Marker's script for 'La Jet√©e' is brilliantly written. The beauty of the screenplay lies in its versatility and with Terry Gilliam's visual flair and bravura, the film elevates to the next level. There can be various interpretations for the film. I think Gilliam's style of storytelling actually provokes varied interpretations. There are red herrings, there are subtle hints and there are unanswered questions. This can be seen as a straight up sci-fi film set in a dystopian future with the phenomenon of time travel in it. The concept of whether time and history can be altered or not plays a big part. However it can also be seen as a film about trauma and reality-escapism. Everyone knows that Terry Gilliam is one of the champions of standing up against the mechanical and overly commercialised treatment of the art form of cinema by the big studios and this discontentment and anger is present in the film. Gilliam clearly again makes subtle commentary about the ill-effects of uncontrolled capitalism. We see people make monologues about the materialistic life, the exposure to commercials,etc. Cruelty towards animals is another topic that is addressed which subtly refers to the repression of the poor by the rich.The film is another example of Terry Gilliam's visual bravura. Just by looking at the dystopian future presented in the film, a viewer would know that this has been made by Gilliam. The look of the film really reminded me of Blade Runner and it has a cyberpunk-esque vibe to it. The film looks bleak and almost dirty, but very intentionally so. The music composed by Paul Buckmaster is beautiful too. When it comes to the acting, I think this is my favourite performance by Bruce Willis. This was back in the day when Willis actually cared about playing a character rather than himself in every film. He really goes for it here and shows range. He is terrifying, he is weird and at times he exudes child-like innocence(which is important in the context of the film). Madeleine Stowe is also very good. She actually has a tough job of playing the most 'normal' character in the film while all hell is breaking loose around her. Brad Pitt is a dynamite in the film. He has to be admired for deciding to play a character like this at a stage in his career when he could have easily used his looks and played generic characters in romantic comedies. He thoroughly deserved the Oscar nomination.'Twelve Monkeys' is a philosophical sci-fi film that leaves the door open for varied interpretations. The acting is great, Gilliam's style and attention to detail is meticulous. This film has to watched and then re-watched to fully admire its brilliance.",9,1,2,2 November 2015
The Babadook," Don't judge a film by its name !!!!!
","The Babadook directed by Jennifer Kent and starring Essie Davis and Noah Wiseman is a straight up psychological horror film. It can be called an art-house horror film. But it would be unfair to call it a monster film,because although there is the presence of a monster in the film, but the storyline represents so much more than just a family being stalked by a monster. There are deep layers to it that the discerning viewer will be able to grasp. The deep psychological undertones of this film and the overall meaning of the storyline makes it a very creepy and disturbing experience. However people who have become accustomed to jump scares will not find any sympathy for The Babadook.The acting by Essie Davis is absolutely amazingly fantastic. She is one of the main reasons why the film works this much. She completely commands the screen with her presence and makes her performance unforgettable. The direction and screenplay by Jennifer Kent are also masterful. The way this film is directed takes the viewer back to the 60s and 70s when the genre of psychological horror and metaphorical horror had not yet been submerged by cheap slashers and jump scares. The Babadook reminded me of Kubrick's The Shining and Polanski's Repulsion in the best way possible.The Babadook is the kind of film that might not startle you and make you jump, but it will linger in your head and bother you with thoughts that are the most disturbing.",9,8,19,28 November 2014
Creed," A rebirth of a franchise with a huge dose of nostalgia !!!
","'Creed' is directed and co-written by Ryan Coogler and it stars, Michael B. Jordan, Sylvester Stallone and Tessa Thompson. It tells the story of Adonis Johnson who never knew his father Apollo Creed. But he loves boxing and he seeks out Rocky Balboa to train him to become a top notch professional.Although there is a theme running through the film about Adonis trying to initially run away from all connections with Apollo Creed to create his own identity but then identifying who he is and owning the name Creed later on, however the film apart from being a rebirth is also a big homage to the Rocky franchise. This movie depends on nostalgia and subtle references to the original series. The screenplay based on a story idea by Coogler is to be honest an updated and adjusted version of familiar elements of the films in the entire Rocky franchise especially the first Rocky film.So the script isn't something that hooked me as it really is a mash- up of familiar elements. But what did really impress me is Coogler's direction and the acting on show. Coogler adds his style of independent filmmaking to the scenes. He really allows the actors to express themselves. There is a great amount of gravitas and humanity that is added to every scene. We end up caring for the characters big time. This is a film that could have easily been cheesy and Coogler's endearing direction prevents that from happening. Apart from the emotional aspect, Coogler shows great craftsmanship too especially in a fight scene where the entire boxing fight in the ring gets captured in one uninterrupted single take which was bloody impressive. Michael B. Jordan is very good as Adonis. He brilliantly expresses the repressed inner struggle to prove himself in his own eyes and kill his inner demons. He also sells the boxing very well physically. But the standout performance in the film comes from Sylvester Stallone. He is surprisingly nuanced and I would go so far as to say that this might be my favourite Stallone performance ever. I have never seen him be this realistic and understated in anything ever before. His sheer charm and likability to some extent elevates the film to the next level.So the film as a whole didn't give me anything that I didn't expect from the point of view of the script. But Coogler's command behind the camera, his emotional storytelling and the acting from Michael B. Jordan and Sylvester Stallone made this a very enjoyable film.P.S. - I always knew Stallone was an Everton fan as I had seen him attend one of their matches at Goodison Park. But I didn't know his love for Everton was so huge. There are whole chunks of this film where you see nothing but the blue of Everton and clearly this was Stallone's idea, not Coogler's.",7,0,2,18 February 2016
The Hustler," It's all about 'character' !!!
","'The Hustler' treats pool not just as a game, but as a self- destructive addiction of the protagonist Eddie Felson. The film is about character or more specifically about the development of character. It's about a character coming to realise what's really important in life. Robert Rossen commits to making Eddie a very complicated character who has both positive as well as negative traits. This is why, the character arc that he undergoes seems very effective. Phil Newman is charismatic as well as extremely emotive in his portrayal. What I also like about the film is the treatment of the character of Sarah. On one hand, she isn't the damsel in distress who is supposed to be saved by Eddie. But on the other hand, neither is she the pixie dream girl who is perfect and the fantasy girlfriend from a male perspective. Just like Eddie, Sarah is a complex character who is given requisite amount of importance and attention by Rossen. Piper Laurie's performance is really really great. There is a particular scene in the film where Eddie and Sarah attend a party. There is a particular tracking shot in that scene(which is marked by extremely loud music) where the camera is on Sarah as she walks towards the camera with Eddie visible at the background talking to another woman. The facial expressions and general demeanour of Laurie in this scene is absolutely heartbreaking. My only little gripe with the film is the treatment of character of Bert Gordon. Performance wise, George C. Scott delivers a good performance which exudes authority and charisma. But unfortunately, the Mephistopheles-esque aura that the character is supposed to personify(this symbolism gets explicitly verbalised in the film) doesn't get enough build up and I didn't really feel his influence on Eddie to be as strong as the film wants us to feel. Overall, 'The Hustler' is a really impressive film that revolves around a sport, but is mainly about character ala 'Raging Bull'.",7,2,2,9 October 2017
Spotlight," A tribute to all the hard working and dedicated journalists !!!
","'Spotlight' co-written by Tom McCarthy and Josh Singer and directed by McCarthy is based on a real life story where The Boston Globe's Spotlight team of investigative journalists made investigations into cases of widespread and systemic child sex abuse in the Boston area by numerous Catholic priests.The acting and style of direction of the film go hand in hand and complement each other. McCarthy gets the most understated, nuanced and restrained performances from each and every one of the members of his amazing cast. Every actor cranks the subtlety up to 11 which along with McCarthy and Singer's naturalistic dialogue makes the characters as realistic as possible. All the actors work together and put the story above their own personal moments to shine on screen. The teamwork of the characters in the film gets beautifully portrayed by the actors. Ruffalo, Keaton, McAdams, Schreiber, Slattery, Tucci, etc. all are at the top of their game.The style of direction, just like the acting is very unflashy. Just like the other McCarthy films that I have watched like 'The Station Agent' and 'Win Win', he gives the story and the characters all the importance without feeling the need to be too stylistic with camera movement. He uses minimalism to maximum effect and respects the subject matter and its importance and expects the viewer to do the same without feeling the need to see exciting edge of the seat moments. Having said that there are subtle directorial decisions like slow zoom-outs or slightly extended shots that are sparingly used by him. The procedural nature of the film is very reminiscent of 'All the President's Men' and 'Zodiac', although it is no way near as dark in its style of storytelling as Zodiac even though the subject matter is equally disturbing.The city of Boston also plays a big role in the film. Even though it is a big city, the fact that it still has a very cosy and local feel to it is underlined by McCarthy. The huge role that the church and the catholic church played/plays in the lives of the Boston dwellers also gets depicted. The timeline of 2001 also gets utilised well. We see the occurrence of 9/11 and the attention of the Boston Globe gets quickly shifted to that story and the persistence and dedication of the Spotlight team on the sex abuse story gets tested temporarily which felt very believable.'Spotlight' is at the basic level a tribute to the hard working and dedicated journalists who love their work and care about the subjects and the people that they write for. This film is an account of a time when internet was starting to expand its horizons and the print media's significance was starting to decline, but that decline had not completely taken place yet. This is a film about a group of investigative journalists who toiled hard without any assistance from the internet. They manually researched, read books and put in the hours to do what they thought needed to be done. 'Spotlight' is a nod of the hat to all of the those hard working journalists of yesteryears. They are heroic not because of the lines that they say in the film, they are heroic because of their work.",9,1,2,6 April 2016
Zodiac," There's a killer on the road !!!!
","Zodiac is based on the novel written by Robert Graysmith about the notorious 'Zodiac' killer who went on a killing spree in and around the San Francisco Bay Area during the late 1960s and the early 1970s. Unlike Seven or Fight Club, Fincher adopted a very non-showy approach to tell the story in the overall sense, but his characteristic style is still visible in the look of many scenes throughout the movie.The script and the screenplay is like a labyrinth or a maze of evidence, documents, leads, red herrings and dead ends. Fincher aggressively puts us in the middle of the investigation and refuses to provide any relief from this never ending saga of relentless evidence analysis and exploration. Due to this, when the film ends you feel like you have been a part of the proceedings too. The film doesn't have any chases or too much gory violence. The murder scenes take place very early within the first 30 minutes,throughout the remaining portion, emphasis is placed on the nitty-gritty aspects of the evidence exploration. We follow Robert Graysmith(Gyllenhaal), Dave Toschi(Ruffalo) and Paul Avery(Downey Jr.) on the continuous pursuit of the Zodiac killer. Along with the real aspects of the investigation, the theme of the film is to show how the lives of investigators can get hugely affected by the harrowing aspect of being a part of such a long winded case which never seems to reach a satisfactory conclusion. It is more about the journey than the destination. Chasing a serial killer can lead to an obsession which is not much different than the obsession which engulfed that very serial killer in the first place and it can lead to complete deterioration of personal and professional lives.For a movie which is 2 hours 45 minutes long, it feels extremely enjoyable and never boring. Fincher avoids clich√©s that have perennially plagued the crime mystery genre. He expects the viewer to keep up with the plot. He never compromises by inserting any unnecessary action scenes. The cinematography like all Fincher films is great. The production design expertly recreates a look of the film very appropriate for the era to which the story belongs. The colour yellow plays a huge role in the visual context to convey the themes in the plot. Above all this film masterfully shows how even in a cop investigation thriller like this, closure can be achieved through means other than the hero shooting the villain in the end.Zodiac is a long film and requires some effort from the viewer while watching, but with the required amount of focus, this is a rewarding experience. The film is supremely re-watchable and the plot always feels addictive no matter how many times you have watched it before.",10,2,2,26 November 2014
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," An apocalyptic comedy !!!
","In 'Paths of Glory', Kubrick attacked the military hierarchy system and the concept of war and blind patriotism from a moralistic standpoint. In 'Dr. Strangelove' he does somewhat the same thing in the form of satire. He managed to generate humour out of a disturbing scenario of a mentally unstable army officer starting a nuclear war without the knowledge of his superiors. Although personally I love 'Paths of Glory' much more than 'Dr. Strangelove', however this is the film where the quintessential Kubrickian style of direction and storytelling was born. One can notice the black comedy, the formal visual style(like camera placement, lighting and editing) and a distinctively deliberate coldness in 'Dr. Strangelove' that would become a staple in pretty much all of Kubrick's subsequent films irrespective of the genre.There are a lot of laugh out loud moments here. The satirical tone infused by Kubrick is overt and unavoidable. Pretty much every conversation scene is rich with sharp dialogue and scathing criticism. However I'd be lying if I say the film stayed with me and lingered in my thoughts for too long. I understand what the film is doing and I admire the technical precision involved, but 'Dr. Strangelove' didn't blow me away like most of Kubrick's later films do. The film tends to meander a bit with unnecessarily extended scenes where we spend time inside the fighter planes during which I genuinely found my interest waning due to the overabundance of technical verbal exchanges. I also think the film's ending should have been stronger.Acting wise I have to mention Peter Sellers, George C. Scott and Sterling Hayden. Sellers(in multiple roles) and Scott provide the eccentric and over-the-top comedy, while Hayden is the deeply intimidating psychopath.I do like 'Dr. Strangelove', but not as much as some of Kubrick's other works",7,1,5,17 May 2017
Alien," Truckers in Space !!!
","'Alien' is the first film in one of the most well known and renowned film franchises of all time. One of the major reasons why 20th Century Fox green-lit this film was the resounding success of another little film set in space known as 'Star Wars' at the box office. 'Alien' was based on a screenplay written by Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett and was directed by Ridley Scott. A crew aboard the space vessel Nostromo on their way home pick up an SOS warning from a distant planet. They decide to check out the planet and the subsequent events lead to an experience for the entire crew which can only be described as nightmarish. Although Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett's screenplay was great and had thematic depth, for me 'Alien' became the masterful horror film that it is due to one man's visual flair and complete command over the subtleties and nuances of filmmaking and camera movement, and that man is Ridley Scott. This film in the hands of some other director could have easily been reduced to a generic, silly genre film about alien monsters which were released in abundance during the 50s, 60s and 70s. But Ridley Scott made something that truly distinguished itself from all previous alien monster films. The claustrophobic atmosphere that Scott creates is enough to suck the viewer in. The film like most Ridley Scott films looks absolutely fantastic. The visual attention to detail is meticulous. The alien planet looks as real and authentic as any alien planet has ever looked on film. Scott slightly borrows the slow and gradual style of storytelling and tension building that Spielberg used in 'Jaws'. Like 'Jaws', we don't see the Xenomorph a lot. But that adds to the tension, the fear and the claustrophobia. The lighting, the editing and the pacing, all work together to the fullest effect.Although most people make a connection between 'Star Wars' and 'Alien' due to their contrasting styles. Both the films were released very close to each other and both films were set in space. But while 'Star Wars' was a fantasy fairy tale, 'Alien' was straight up horror. I can understand this comparison, but for me 'Alien' shares a deep thematic connection with '2001: A Space Odyssey'. Both films deal with the duel between man and machine and they both explore the question: What it means to be human? Incidentally this was also the basic theme of Ridley Scott's next sci-fi film 'Blade Runner'. After knowing that Ash was actually a droid, on reflection, I do think that the relationship between Ash and Ripley has some similarities with the relationship between HAL and Bowman. Ripley at the beginning refuses to let Kane (John Hurt) in by obeying the company laws while he has the face- hugger on his face, but Ash actually lets him in which might seem to be a very humane act. But later his true identity gets revealed and he has this beautiful monologue about how he appreciates the Xenomorph's perfect body structure and its purity which lies in its lack of emotions and feelings. This film is also undeniably about the ill-effects of capitalism. The Weyland-Yutani Corporation sends this crew to a mission as dangerous as this without informing them anything for the sole purpose of acquiring this alien life form and using it as a weapon. This shows the lack of humanity in the way the big corporation treats its workers. This lack of respect for the workers and the existing class division also gets repeatedly hinted at with Brett and Parker's constant complaints about being underpaid. These workers are made to go through hell and utter madness in distant parts of the universe where they themselves are alien just because the big corporation wants to use the Xenomorph for its weapons division. The miserable plight of the crew in completely mad and alien surroundings has a thematic link with the madness in 'Apocalypse Now' where young men are made to fight in mad environments. To be honest, the Xenomorph is not the villain in the film, the villain is the Weyland-Yutani Corporation.Another very apparent element of the script is the sexual subtext. The Xenomorph and other alien elements and sets were designed by H.R. Giger based on his own artwork which clearly have sexual undertones. Right from the design of the Xenomorph's body to the concept of the face-hugger and chest-burster, there is a sexual angle to the narrative that hints at themes of rape and unwanted pregnancies. Through Ridley Scott's imagery, it is thematically implied that the corporation in the way it renders the human workers expendable is actually devouring them. The face-hugger uses the body of the host to give birth to the Xenomorph, in the same way thematically the corporation is using the helpless crew just to serve its own purposes. Although the human characters in the film don't have a lot of back story, but the conversations that they have among each other are extremely realistic which makes the characters believable as ordinary human beings. Every character gets distinguished from the other due to the naturalistic acting. However for me the two best performances in the film come from Sigourney Weaver as Ripley and Ian Holm as Ash. They play off each other brilliantly. Ripley's character has evolved over the course of the entire Alien franchise. In this film Ripley is the indefatigable survivor.I only have one minor complaint. I think the screenplay and Scott's execution of the scene leading up to Brett's death could have been a little better instead of following a bit of horror trope. However the death itself is chillingly shot.'Alien' is one of the greatest sci-fi films ever made due to the care with which Ridley Scott treated every individual element of the film and also due to every one else who worked with Scott and contributed with their own ideas.",9,3,4,1 January 2016
Capote," A complicated man investigates a complicated crime !!!
","'Capote' directed by Bennett Miller is based on Gerald Clarke's biography 'Capote'. It stars Philip Seymour Hoffman as the titular Truman Capote and also Catherine Keener as Harper Lee, Clifton Collins Jr. as Perry Smith and Chris Cooper as Alvin Dewey. Capote notices an account of a horrific crime involving the murder of an entire family named the Clutters in Kansas on the newspaper. He decides to write a non-fiction novel on the mentioned real event and so he goes to Kansas to gather more and more information about the case. While he is in Kansas, the two murderers namely Perry Smith and Dick Hickock get caught and he starts visiting them in jail.I had already seen Richard Brooks' film 'In Cold Blood' which is directly based on Capote's novel of the same name which he ended up writing about the mentioned crime. So, I was already aware of the basic aspects of the story and the plot. But, while Brooks' film was a film that told the story by following Perry and Dick on their journey, 'Capote' is a film where the story gets told with Truman Capote being at the center of the narrative. Although having said that, Bennett Miller never resorts to melodramatic means to make us relate to Capote or humanise him. To a great extent, this is a story told in a subjective way about an idiosyncratic individual. His actions and decisions can be interpreted in various ways.As a viewer the first impression of Truman Capote that I got when I started watching the film was one of unrestricted narcissism. Capote clearly was a narcissist. He paid people to throw him compliments in front of friends. He always had to be the center of all gossip in his social gatherings, etc. The reasons behind his obsession with compliments and hogging the limelight in his gatherings could have roots in his childhood. The trauma and the extreme hardships he faced during his childhood made him insecure. So even though he achieved success using his intellect through his writing, he could never let go of his past and his insecurities which led to him becoming a huge narcissist. I think it is hinted that Capote became so obsessed with the newspaper account of the Clutter murders because it gave him an opportunity to spend some time in a place like Kansas which will remind him of his childhood in Alabama. Then he comes into contact with Perry Smith and Dick Hickcock, the murderers when they get caught by the police. Capote becomes more and more intrigued by Perry in particular. Through their conversations and his research, Capote manages to notice an uncanny similarity in the nature of his own and Perry's childhood and the manner in which both of them were brought up. Capote becomes so interested, that he even gets them a lawyer to help the 2 convicts with their appeal after they are sentenced to death. Now the complexity of Truman Capote's nature and the film's plot as a whole comes to the forefront after Capote and Perry start opening up to each other. Why Capote starts visiting Perry more and more frequently can be up for debate. On one hand some will say that his sole priority was to gain the confidence of Perry, so that he would divulge everything about the crime which would immensely help Capote to enrich his novel with more intricate details. One the other hand, some might say that he genuinely fell in love with Perry and cared for him. But I believe both view points are justified. He certainly did manipulate Perry into telling him things for the sake of his novel, but I also couldn't help but sense the development of a romantic attachment between them. This duality in the nature of his relationship with Perry, in the end drives Capote to complete emotional breakdown, when he juggles between wanting Perry and Dick to hang so that he could finish his novel and his actual compassion towards Perry. This morality test ends up breaking him emotionally and we see him reduced to tears when he faces Perry minutes before his hanging. He cries because he realises that maybe he had compromised his morality by using Perry for his novel. The fact that Capote couldn't finish any other book after 'In Cold Blood' shows how much of an effect these circumstances had on him. Clearly the hanging of Perry crushed him. The funny thing is although Capote wallows in sorrow with the hanging, I'm not sure the viewers will do the same, as after all Perry was still a murderer.Philip Seymour Hoffman can never be admired enough for his turn as Truman Capote. He could have easily been very annoying with the peculiar voice and the mannerism. But that never happens because instead of mimicking Capote, he completely internalises him and becomes the character. I could only see Capote on screen, not Hoffman, and that is fantastic. Clifton Collins Jr. as Perry Smith is also brilliant. I think Catherine Keener as Harper Lee and Chris Cooper are a bit underused in the film.Bennett Miller has a very characteristic way of portraying peculiar characters by keeping the viewer at a distance. His films follow these characters, they are never from these characters' points of view. He leaves it open for the viewer to interpret and come up with reasons to justify the actions of the characters in his films without judging them on his own. Truman Capote in the film is neither glorified nor portrayed as an evil human being. He is just portrayed as a complicated man with issues. 'Capote' isn't the generic biopic which wants the viewer to fall in love with its protagonist. Bennett Miller captures a few crucial years in the life of a complicated man and asks us to make up our own minds about what he truly was like. Highly Recommended !!!",9,2,2,7 October 2015
Barry Lyndon," Ambition goes up against Determinism !!!
","'Barry Lyndon' has a connection with '2001: A Space Odyssey'. Just like each character in 2001(who represent their species), Barry is shown to be someone who is willing to do anything to survive and prosper. His instincts generally revolve around his selfish desires of survival. In 2001 the desperate measures to survive at all cost end up being insignificant and inconsequential because of the implied presence of a higher power represented by the monoliths. This presence of a higher power is possibly meant to imply the concept of determinism and subversion of the idea of free will. In 'Barry Lyndon', Barry's father was killed in a duel right at the beginning of the film and Kubrick adds no feeling to that scene whatsoever. Clearly losing his father at a very young age had to have determined the life that Barry was going to lead. Having seen his life get shaped for him at a very young age without him having any influence, everything Barry does subsequently in his life in nothing but to achieve success, wealth and prosperity by asserting his own will instead of having to march to the beat of fate's tune. It is remarkable how similar Barry's sensibilities are to Charles Foster Kane's in 'Citizen Kane'. Kane was another man whose future was decided by someone else at a very young age and everything that Kane did subsequently in his life was to ensure that his life never revolved around anyone else's whims.The constant zoom-outs in the film are deliberate and thematically relevant. In Act 1, we see Barry embark on adventures, visits various places, fights in duels and wars,etc. and does everything else to ensure he looks out for himself and also to ensure he achieves material gains and an elevation in social status which he gets by marrying into wealth and class. He achieves temporary success through the sheer power of his will. This is why I think the zoom-outs in Act 1 are supposed to be premonitory. All of Barry's assertive actions are undermined by Kubrick's camera. Kubrick constantly zooms out to expand the visual field which makes Barry and the other characters look very small in the respective frames. But making Barry look miniscule in the shots, Kubrick is visually driving home the philosophical notion that no matter how hard Barry tries to willfully determine his future, in the end his actions won't matter in the bigger picture. What fate holds for him in the future will materialise whether he likes it or not. This is how Kubrick brings in determinism in the story. In Act 2, the zoom- outs are meant to show the characters completely frozen in time like the classic-era pictures on the walls.There is a scene where Barry views a picture on the wall and decides to buy it. There is a scene that comes up later which is significant because the framing is very similar to the aforementioned scene but the important thing is, this time Barry takes the place of the picture and King George III is checking him out. Barry as a person holds as little a significance as the characters in the painting.Although in Act 1 a number of the shots look like paintings too, but it is in Act 2 that the painting motif gets its thematic poignancy. This is because the majority of Act 2 takes place inside the palace walls and the actual pictures on the wall are constantly in view. The actual pictures on the wall themselves allow Kubrick to draw the comparison between them and his picture-like frame compositions. The purpose of the characters in the pictures on the wall is defined not by them, but by the person who drew them. Similarly the purpose of Barry's life and where it goes and how it crystallizes won't be determined by Barry, but by something/someone else, maybe God, maybe some other higher power, or mere chance(from a nihilistic standpoint) or maybe the society itself that Barry is a part of. Even though, he became Barry Lyndon, a lot of people in his surroundings never saw him as anything other than Barry Redmond. In the end all his achievements went in vain. The masterful thing is that the last time we see Barry in the film, he has his back to the camera. But the significant thing is, instead of zoom-outs, we get a zoom- in. Hence at this moment, instead of expanding the visual field, Kubrick contracts it to convey that Barry's ambition has been put in its place by fate.The cinematography of the film as has been mentioned time and again is jaw-dropping and coupled with the meticulous production design, 'Barry Lyndon' ends up being one of the most authentic, convincing and fully developed recreations of a period setting in the history of motion pictures.Although Kubrick again sets an emotionally distant tone, just like his other films, however the Act 2 of 'Barry Lyndon' contains some of the most emotionally charged scenes, moments and shots of Kubrick's entire career. Losing his father at a very early age, one aspect of Barry's life involved moving from one father figure to another. But when he himself becomes a father, he tries his level best to have the most loving relationship with his son and Kubrick actually upholds the purity of this father-son relationship by treating it with humanism without judgement.I have heard that 'Barry Lyndon' is Martin Scorsese's favourite Kubrick film. I find that interesting because on examination one can find that 'Barry Lyndon' and 'Goodfellas' feature an exceptionally similar arc of 'rags to riches to rags' revolving around two immensely ambitious men with the drive to break the class restrictions and rise to the top with the sheer power of their will and persistence. However, fate in the end reigns supreme and makes all their achievements and adventures seem pointless. Determinism plays a joke on them.",9,4,6,22 July 2017
Full Metal Jacket," The inhumanity of War !!!
","One of the many characteristic aspects of Kubrick's cinema is the deliberate lack of humanity and intimacy. He made it a point to keep the viewer at a distance from the characters and the circumstances. 'Full Metal Jacket' is divided into two specific parts. The first part involving the basic training in the boot camp, benefits immensely from Kubrick's emotionally distant filmmaking. This first part is a brilliantly directed, shot and acted satire on the dehumanisation of young boys in the army. We see the innocent and honorable masculinity of these boys who want to do themselves, their families and their country proud, get replaced by toxic masculinity which involves killing your identity and your humanity, equating the lust for sex with the lust for violence, keeping all your emotions suppressed and in the end becoming ultra-aggressive, remorseless, animalistic killers. R. Lee Ermey pretty much single-handedly carries this first part of the film through sheer verbal aggression. The character of Sergeant Hartman played by Ermey is pretty much the devil just like the character of Terence Fletcher played by J. K. Simmons in 'Whiplash'. Just like great satire, there are numerous sequences and moments in this part where the audience will feel like laughing and then within a few seconds feel disturbed and disgusted for laughing at something terrible and reprehensible.While Kubrick's emotionally distant filmmaking is beneficial to the first part of the film, it actually to some extent becomes a weakness in the second part. In the second part, we move to Vietnam where we see the soldiers having to execute everything that they learnt in boot camp, at the real battlefield. Now there certainly are moments in this second half that I love like the sequence of the talking head interviews of the soldiers which further underline how pointless this war was and how clueless even the soldiers were about their missions and the general purpose of their temporary existence in Vietnam. I also especially loved the extended situational set- piece that the film ends with as it provides a devastating and perhaps a sorrowful conclusion to the arc of the character of Sergeant Joker played by Matthew Modine who for the major part of the film remains the voice of reason, logic and humanity. However apart from these aforementioned scenes, this second half of 'Full Metal Jacket' lacks a sense of cohesion. It feels like a random collection of vignettes, some of which aren't very interesting. The reason why some of the vignettes seem uninteresting is Kubrick's refusal to allow us into the mental state of the characters that are introduced in the second half or give us any insight into their psyches apart from some surface level behavioral tendencies. There are many scenes where we see the soldiers talk to each other and spend time together, but those scenes rang hollow to me and felt somewhat forced and artificial. This inability to completely appreciate the second half of the film on my part could be completely subjective. Since I loved the first half so much, maybe the change in setting and tone that takes place was always going to make it tough for the second half to measure up when compared to the first.Technically 'Full Metal Jacket' isn't as showy and attention grabbing as some of Kubrick's other films, however it still retains a lot of his characteristic visual touches like the use of one-point perspective and the use of steadicam,etc. The urban, ground level combat scenes are very well staged and directed. The production design has to be admired a lot for those scenes too. From an acting standpoint, I have already mentioned R. Lee Ermey for his brilliant performance. I think Matthew Modine and Vincent D'Onofrio deserve special mentions too for coming up with contrasting, yet equally compelling performances respectively.In conclusion, I'll say 'Full Metal Jacket' doesn't quite achieve greatness due to the flawed second half of the film. But it's still an exceptionally good movie that comes close to greatness due to the incredibly brilliant first half which I think is as good and as powerful as anything Kubrick has ever done in a visceral scene. It's a film that can be directly connected to 'Paths of Glory' and 'Dr. Strangelove' in terms of Kubrick's criticism of institutional authority, dogmatic patriotism and toxic masculinity. It's most certainly worth recommending.",8,2,2,7 November 2017
The Grapes of Wrath," An account of people trapped in the cage of poverty and misery !!!
","The Grapes of Wrath directed by John Ford from a screenplay by Nunnally Johnson was the film adaptation of the very well known and renowned book of the same name by John Steinbeck. The film like the book is set during the era of the Great Depression in the 1930s and follows the Joad family from Oklahoma as they deal with poverty on their way to the 'promised land' of California after being thrown out of their own land and property.The themes of the film revolve around the concept of the loss of home. After the Joads get uprooted from their home like many other farmer families, they head out for California in their truck. This truck becomes their mobile home. They become wanderers in search of a real home. It is unreal how the issue of migrants that enrich Steinbeck's novel and Ford's film is still extremely relevant to this very day. We see the local officials mistreat, mislead and exploit them and all the poor migrants like the Joads go along with it with the hope that there might be a light at the end of the tunnel. The Darwinian concept of the 'survival of the fittest' also comes very much into the equation. Once the Joads leave their land, some members of the family lose their grit, hope and conviction like Grandpa, Grandma and Pa, while on the other hand, the misery and sorry plight of the circumstances emboldens Ma and makes her the source of strength for everyone including Tom. Tom Joad is a very interesting character. He starts out as the angry loner. He then comes into contact and becomes a part of the family unit. But the misery and struggles force him in an ironic sense to re-embrace the identity of the outlaw loner to bring about a change. The purity and sweetness of the mother-son relationship between Tom and Ma is given a lot of attention by Ford and Johnson, even more so than Steinbeck did in the novel.Ford's direction in the film is understated and not very flashy. There are moments of great artistic imagery, eg: the 3 shadows trampled by the tractor marks, Gregg Toland's brilliant cinematography under Ford's direction involving shadows specially in the scene where Tom and Casy meet Muley, the brilliant shot where the Joad family leaves on their truck bidding adieu to their home and Ford decides to hold the shot a few seconds longer after they have left to show the wind, dust and garbage blowing towards the house,etc. Ford's direction in the scenes in the Transient Camps is absolutely brilliant. He uses the moving camera from the perspective of the Joads to introduce them and the viewers to all the other migrants. The other aspects of those scenes involving the hungry kids are very touching.But the film I thought is flawed. First of all, clearly due to all the restrictions that films of that era were plagued by, there are a lot of crucial aspects of the original novel that get watered down a bit. I am certainly not someone who gets annoyed when the film is very different to the original source material because I have the maturity to understand that cinema and literature are two completely different fields. But I do think if the political aspect of the novel was explored more boldly in the film, it would have worked to its benefit. Another aspect of the film that put me off a bit is some of the hokey nature of the written lines. Nunnally Johnson's writing at times gets too cheesy and overt. The overt nature of some of the lines spoken by the characters might work on the page of a book, but on screen, it does stick out in an ugly way. The acting by the ensemble cast is also a bit too theatrical at times which made it difficult for me to maintain a constant emotional attachment with the characters. Although the quality of acting is not consistent from everyone, but Henry Fonda as Tom Joad, Jane Darwell as Ma Joad and John Qualen as Muley are the ones who stand out. Fonda accurately conveys the repressed anger and frustration that makes up Tom's character with moments of touching emotions. Darwell is as likable as ever as Ma. She exudes a caring and loving quality that is impossible to avoid. She also plays the character with some strength as Ma does in a way become the backbone of the family after they leave their home. Although John Qualen has a peculiar appearance, but the power of his performance forced me to really empathise with Muley's pains and struggles.'The Grapes of Wrath' is not flawless. In my view it has its fair share of issues much of which was down to rigid restrictions that were imposed upon the films of that era. But even with its flaws, it still is a very solid John Ford film which made me feel for the characters. Just like the novel, it forces the viewer to put themselves in the shoes of the central characters and live the struggle with them.",7,2,3,2 June 2016
Incendies," Brilliantly directed portrayal of life in times of chaos marred by a flashy climax !!!
","'Incendies' is a film directed by Denis Villeneuve and it is adapted from Wajdi Mouawad's play of the same name with the screenplay co- written by Villeneuve and Val√©rie Beaugrand-Champagne. The film's plot has an epic-feel to it because the film takes place over a lengthy spell of time covering a large number of years. The film stars Lubna Azabal as Nawal Marwan and M√©lissa D√©sormeaux-Poulin and Maxim Gaudette as Nawal's twin children Jeanne and Simon respectively. After Nawal's death, Jeanne and Simon get informed that their mother had left two letters one for each of them respectively. They learn that their father is alive and they have a brother whose existence they were unaware of. Jeanne is supposed to deliver her letter to the father, while Simon is supposed to deliver his letter to their brother. This mission takes both of them individually to an unnamed Middle-Eastern country as they try to piece together clues to gather more and more information about their mother's past.This is a film that becomes very tough to watch at times. Villeneuve really goes for a gritty, stripped down depiction of what it is like to survive in a country divided by hate and experiencing civil war. The film is brilliantly directed and Villeneuve's brutal guerrilla style of shooting reminded me Alfonso Cuar√≥n's style in 'Children of Men'. The themes of the film range from the absurdity of hatred borne out of religious diversity to elements of immigration. It shows the sorry state of the lives of children in countries and regions devastated by war. Their lives pretty much end before they even begin. The film also underlines the concept of showing people living is financially well off countries, the privilege that they sometimes forget to acknowledge. The acting is brilliant from the main players, but a special mention has to be given to Lubna Azabal. A fair portion of the narrative of the film rests on her shoulders. The screenplay is cleverly written. The film doesn't give you all the information all at once. The expositions happen gradually. The narrative shifts from mother to daughter constantly in a very Godfather II-esque manner.I would have probably given this film a 9, had it not been for the ending. The shocking revelation at the end is genuinely unexpected and has an impact while you're watching the film. But once you start to think about it, it becomes very difficult to buy it. To some extent it might be meaningful from a thematic standpoint, but in a film directed in such an aggressively realistic manner, even symbolism has to have some literal believability in the context of the plot.'Incendies' is a well directed, well acted film about war, hatred, intolerance and the hardships of living in ultra-conservative and unstable societies. The film will have an impact and make you ponder about life itself. But the ending of the film in my eyes hinders it from making the transition from good to great.",7,0,2,24 October 2015
The Thing," Great singular examples of craftsmanship in an otherwise vapid film !!!
","'The Thing' was one of those big cinematic blind spots for me. This film like many cult classics didn't enjoy critical or box office success at the time of its release, but has gradually over the years become a very popular and loved movie. This was my first viewing of the film and my review is based on a single viewing.I don't think it is possible to watch 'The Thing' and not get reminded of Ridley Scott's 'Alien'. Both films came out in round about the same time within a span of 3 years. Both films are about a team of people isolated in the middle of nowhere being hounded by an alien monster. However, 'The Thing' didn't impress me anywhere near as much as 'Alien' does every time I watch it.Let me first point out the elements of the film that I liked. The practical effects that are on show in the film are some of the best ever put on screen. There are moments of sheer terror due to the convincing nature of the practical effects. Another positive aspect of the film is that John Carpenter really knows how to build up the tension. He knows how to subtly move the camera or hold a shot for just the right amount of time to create a sense of dread in the mind of the viewer. Another great aspect of the film is the dog that we meet right at the beginning. Carpenter somehow got the dog to perform as well as any animal I have ever seen perform on screen. My problems with the film stem from the lack of depth in the script and lack of depth in the characters. 'Alien' works so well because it has so much going on underneath the monster film surface. It is a commentary on the gradual loss of human qualities in the age of capitalism along with the exploration of disturbing themes like rape and unwanted pregnancies. Unfortunately I did not find any subtext in 'The Thing'. I have read some articles where people have tried to find an allegory for the Cold War, but I just didn't observe any depth in the screenplay to think along those lines. Another huge problem is that I found the characters to be very bland with no depth what so ever. In 'Alien' we don't get much back story about the characters either, but Ridley Scott used multiple scenes where we found the characters engaging in small talk and being as realistic as possible allowing us to relate with them. 'The Thing' has almost no quiet scenes where the characters are talking about ordinary, banal stuff. That just didn't make the characters interesting enough and since the characters weren't compelling enough, I found myself losing interest slowly and at the climax of the film I really got bored.As I wrote earlier, this review contains my opinions about the film after watching it once. I might change my stance with subsequent viewings. But right now, I have to say 'The Thing' left me underwhelmed.",5,6,11,21 April 2016
American Psycho," The man behind the mask !!!
","It is very difficult to pinpoint the genre that American Psycho belongs to. It can be called a horror film, a psychological thriller, a social commentary, a strange character study, a film- noir thriller,a black comedy,etc. But no matter what you call it, it certainly is one thing and that is disturbing. Christian Bale takes off the facial masque at the beginning of the film and what follows is utterly disturbing and gruesome.The film is based on the novel of the same name written by Bret Easton Ellis and it is set in the 1980s. The primary theme of the storyline is to underline in an exaggerated way how some people belonging to the elite upper class of society get driven by greed, lust for power, materialism and uncontrolled ambition to the point where they almost lose their humanity completely. In order to justify and validate the impression that they want others to have of them and they have of themselves, they go to absolutely disturbing lengths and violate other people. But all this wouldn't have worked had the film not been a great character study and had the film not involved a fascinating performance by Christian Bale playing the role of Patrick Bateman. We see that Bateman is not only trying to hide his true self from others but also from his own self. Thus in order to convince himself that he is better than others and not inferior in any way and also to hide his true nature from himself, Bateman treats others in the most disturbing manner possible.This is without a doubt, one of the best performances in Christian Bale's career. He manages to expertly portray both sides of the character of Bateman. He is on one hand extremely suave and debonair looking, but on the other hand also manages to bring the requisite amount of violence and ruthlessness in his performances. His facial expressions change very quickly and viciously all the time to accentuate the fact that his character is always pretending to be one thing or the other in front of everyone else. Some of his screams and gestures in the film will make the sensitive viewers have nightmares.The film has a very dreamy look and feel about it in a noirish sense. The director Mary Harron manages to conjure black comedy in the midst of all the madness for which the adapted screenplay and original novel also have to be admired. She also manages to end the film in a very artistically ambiguous manner. She asks the viewer to make his/her mind up about what really happened and leaves the door open for multiple interpretations. American Psycho is a socially relevant film as well as a disturbing character study. The direction is very good and the central performance is fascinating. This is the kind of film that continues to linger in your thoughts after it ends and is extremely conducive for retrospective analysis.",9,0,0,2 June 2015
The Shining," Kubrick does Horror !!!
","Kubrick was exceptional at making every film that he made feel like a 'Kubrick film' irrespective of what the source material might be. 'The Shining' is a Kubrick film through and through even though it is based on a Stephen King novel, who himself has a singular, unique voice. Visually, the film has all the Kubrickian elements like the use of wide angle lenses, the use of deep focus, the use of one point perspective, the extensive use of tracking shots, characters doing the Kubrick stare, precise use of the zoom, etc. Particularly the score in the film By Wendy Carlos is just phenomenal. The music and the score is essential and indispensable in creating the dread that Kubrick is looking for. But tonally too, the film has Kubrick written all over it, since unlike King's novel, the movie is relentlessly inhuman and pessimistic.In the book, Jack Torrance is a recovering alcoholic who genuinely loves his family, but ends up falling prey to the lure of the evil that is the Overlook Hotel. But there certainly is a humanity to him. In Kubrick's film, Jack Torrance never comes across as anything other than an unsettling character. Casting Jack Nicholson for this role had to have been a specific choice. Jack Torrance in the film is a creepy, unlikable man who seems like someone who was always on the verge of slipping into complete madness and the foreboding isolation of the Overlook Hotel only acts as a catalyst in that process.While the novel has clear supernatural mystical elements, the film retains a sense of ambiguity throughout its running time. Kubrick constantly juggles elements of the supernatural with the question that maybe all this happening in the minds of the characters and maybe, just maybe, we are watching the events from the POV of unreliable narrators.'The Shining' is a horror film, but not in the sense that it is very scary. I don't think the film is very scary, at least not in the conventional sense of the term. I think 'The Shining' is an example of film that expertly uses a bone chilling sense of dread along with visceral imagery to unsettle and disturb the viewer instead of merely scaring him/her. The film opens up its scope towards the end and especially with the last shot to suggest the historical and cyclical nature of violence, evil and human vileness which is quintessential Kubrick, but at the heart of it, 'The Shining' is a story about a family with a deeply flawed masculine figure with a death wish. His violence against his wife and his child is unsettling because it's the kind of horror that is too real and too familiar in our world.",9,1,3,7 November 2017
The Machinist," A multi-layered and dark character study !!!
","When you start watching 'The Machinist', two things strike you instantly. The cinematography which is almost black and white which gives off a very intimidating and grimly dark look to the film. The other most obvious thing that will strike you is Christian Bale's physique or should I say the lack of it. He looks scrawny and almost scarily anorexic. He really became the character of Trevor Reznik in the film and this is a brilliant example of method acting of the ultimate level.The Machinist as a film depends largely on the eerie atmosphere that surrounds the film. From the first scene to the last, there is a consistent sense of dread and almost a despondent hopelessness that permeate from the screen. The film can be called a psychological thriller and also a horror film, but at the heart of it is an emotional character study, although for most of the film the viewer might feel lost and not find it too emotional. The film is brilliantly directed with a great style of storytelling. The director opts for a lot of reticence during the film, which might leave the viewer a bit perplexed about the goings-on in the film at times, but it always keeps the mystery alive. There is a lot of great visual imagery. The screenplay consciously makes an attempt to distort the distinctions between reality and dream sequences in the film. Hence the editing technique of certain scenes going by abruptly without a proper resolution actually makes sense and helps to accentuate the themes of the storyline. As soon as the film started getting weirder and weirder, the name Dostyovsky did come across my mind and my instincts about some Dostyovsky influence were vindicated by the scene where we see Trevor reading the 'The Idiot' written by Dostyovsky. There are also some Satanic and hell-related symbolism in the film. Right in the first scene we see the reflection of three towers on Trevor's face and these towers closely resemble the pitchfork seen in many imagined images of the Devil. In a scene where Trevor goes on a ride in the amusement park with a boy named Nicholas, there comes a point where they have to choose between one way which might lead them to 'Salvation' and the other which will lead them to 'Hell' and that scene is extremely expressive and tells us a lot about what choices Trevor might have made earlier in his life.The director does a great job of keeping the narrative extremely interesting. Christian Bale as I have already mentioned is fantastic, not only does he physically become the character, but he also uses some very impressive acting choices for this character which range from the subtle and understated to the dramatically loud. Although I wasn't really shocked by the denouement at the end as I sort of saw it coming but I still remained extremely interested in the plight of this strange man. Viewers can find some similarities with other films like Fight Club and Memento which are there in plenty. So you can question the film's originality, but I don't think you can question its overall quality and the director's ability to grab your attention and not let go of it.",9,1,1,7 May 2015
Aliens," Aliens vs Guns !!!
","'Aliens' is the 2nd film in the Alien film franchise and probably the most popular film in the aforementioned franchise. Written and directed by James Cameron, this film begins after the events in Ridley Scott's 'Alien'. Ripley survives after her escape vessel is recovered after drifting across the galaxy while being in cryogenic sleep for 57 years. On Earth, no one believes her story about the events on the planet LV-426 which she experienced and she loses her licence. The Weyland-Yutani Corporation had already ordered the colonisation of LV-426 during Ripley's extended absence. But suddenly all communication with the colony gets lost and the company decides to send a team of tough, rugged, space marines to investigate the situation along with Ripley to help them with her knowledge. James Cameron did something exceedingly brave when he decided to practically change the genre in the sequel to an immensely popular original film. While Ridley Scott's 'Alien' was sci-fi horror with elements of tension and claustrophobia, Cameron's 'Aliens' even though it still retains some of the slow tension building in the 1st half, is basically a straight up action blockbuster which makes it much more accessible to the general masses. It has the 80s written all over it. This film raises the stakes and makes everything bigger and louder than 'Alien'. There are explosions, there are machine guns, and this time instead of one, Ripley along with the other marines faces a whole army of Xenomorphs. The film again looks beautiful and the visuals hold up on Blu Ray. Cameron's craft as a director can't be doubted after watching this. Cameron holds the tension in the first half and then bombards the viewer with one brutal action set-piece after another in the second half.When it comes to the themes, Cameron actually retains the theme of the ill-effects of capitalism that was a part of 'Alien'. But although this capitalism angle does appear in 'Alien', Ridley Scott was a little more subtle, while I felt Cameron went a bit overboard to drive home the evil corporation element in the storyline and at times it became slightly unrealistic. Another element is of course feminism. Ripley, I believe becomes the true action hero in this film more than in 'Alien'. She overcomes all the naysayers above her in the hierarchy and truly owns her power and evolves into a truly powerful woman. We also clearly see strong themes of motherhood running throughout the film which again is handled in a slightly overt way. But there also hints at racism in the script and this racism theme I think is what Cameron handles the best with the requisite amount of nuance.Unfortunately, this film didn't have the lingering effect that 'Alien' had in my mind. I preferred 'Alien's subtlety over the big and blockbuster feel of this film. The grand scale of the action sequences in this film genuinely makes 'Alien' look like an indie horror film. But I thought the endless action sequences although very well directed in the end to some extent diluted the overall effect and at times went into ridiculous territory. The film also has a number of endings like 'Return of the King'. There are also certain relationships that are forged in the course of the narrative that made me correctly predict who is going to live in the end and who won't. Sigourney Weaver is absolutely brilliant in this film. She richly deserved the Oscar nomination. She conveys every emotion possible in the film be it frustration, love, anger or fear. She also completely commits to the role and becomes a compelling action hero. Ripley evolves from the role of indefatigable survivor in 'Alien' to the role of the tough, bad-ass mother in this film. Although most of the characters in 'Aliens' lack the realism and are not as believable as the Nostromo crew in 'Alien', but they are entertaining and funny. I'll give a special mention to Bill Paxton, Jenette Goldstein and Michael Biehn. 'Aliens' is a film that I can enjoy a lot and watch over and over again. But every time I do, it somehow fails to stick in my mind for too long due to the over-dependence on action sequences. It is a big 80s action film that is one of the best of its genre, but still in my eyes not as deep and satisfying as the original film in the series.",7,1,1,1 January 2016
The Exorcist," The power of Faith goes up against Misery and Despair !!!
","It is pretty useless to start this review by summarising the basic plot of 'The Exorcist', because let's face it, even people who haven't really seen the film know what it is about in a cursory way. Everyone knows that this film has a girl supposedly possessed by a demon named Pazuzu, but people who read between the lines, will know that this is not just a horror film with scares(which are there),it's also about existentialism and it deals with bigger issues.I think 'The Exorcist' is extremely layered. It is open to literally infinite interpretations. I am pretty sure my interpretation of the meaning of this film might be radically different to some other viewer's. Personally I think, this is a horror film, but it's not about the supernatural from a thematic standpoint. I think all the scenes involving supernatural elements and antics are supposed to be metaphorical. Friedkin has to be really appreciated for making a film that says so much without showing a lot. I watched the director's cut and was really impressed by the fact that so many things were merely hinted at without Friedkin giving you details about them. Those subtle hints and their implications can completely change your view of the film and your perspective. I completely agree with Roger Ebert's opinion that 'The Exorcist' is a very Begmanesque existential film that deals with questions of faith and despair. The most significant thing that the film talks about is the relevance and importance of faith in this cruel, hopeless world filled with misery, despair and cynicism. The film says the world is a cruel place where with every passing day our faith and belief in God will be questioned, but at times of great trouble, we will have nothing else to resort to apart from faith in humanity and God, irrespective of whether you believe in God or not, and that faith can help us get the better of our demons. William Friedkin brilliantly captures the existential feel of the William Peter Blatty novel and also Blatty's screenplay. Linda Blair as Regan is probably one of the most iconic horror film characters of all time and her 'possessed' face is something that has scared people through generations. Ellen Burstyn is also good as Chris, the mother who feels helpless at the prospect of finding a cure for her daughter's problem which she doesn't understand. Max Von Sydow has dealt with existentialism and faith throughout his acting career because of his frequent collaborations with the legend Ingmar Bergman and he is brilliant and very convincing in the short,but very significant role of Father Merrin in this film. But having said all that, I should say that this film belongs to Jason Miller as the Father Karras. Miller comes up with a heartbreaking performance portraying the inner struggle that his character is going through. We are shown that events in his life, particularly the ones involving his mother and all the misery in the world that he has seen due to his constant contact with the general people as a priest has led him to gradually lose faith in God and religion. I think thematically, Karras is the most significant character in the film and his character's arc helps Friedkin to end the film on an optimistic note.This is without a doubt Friedkin's best film. Although 'The French Connection' and 'The Exorcist' are completely different films both plot-wise and theme-wise, however I still could see some similarities between them in the way that Friedkin uses the two colours- blue and red artistically to give them a meaning and to visually imply certain things. Friedkin brilliantly raises tension in the film without using jump scares(there is one of them though). Some stills and shots of the film are breathtaking and almost goose bump-inducing. 'The Exorcist' is one of those films that leaves the door wide open for endless interpretations. Every person's take on it can differ. It is artistically shot, brilliantly acted and it has a deep, meaningful thematically rich script thanks to Batty. I repeat, as far as I am concerned, 'The Exorcist' is not about ghosts and demons in the literal sense, but it still is one of the greatest horror films ever made.",10,1,1,19 July 2015
Foxcatcher," The idiosyncrasies of the human mind !!!
","Bennett Miller has always had the ability to get the best out of his actors. He did it with Phillip Seymour Hoffman in Capote, he did it with Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill in Moneyball, and now he has done it with Steve Carell, Mark Ruffalo and Channing Tatum. Mark Ruffalo has done fantastic work before, but I have never seen Carell and Tatum do anything as good as their work in Foxcatcher before. All three actors transform themselves physically and emotionally to give absolutely astonishing performances. This film is based on a true story. Like the real life story itself, the film is also very dark, haunting and extremely unpredictable. This is a very dark and interesting take on sports films. The film never ever resorts to clich√©s and remains entirely grounded in reality. The style of storytelling is hypnotic, moody and the pace is intentionally slow. Miller uses minimal editing and allows the actors to express themselves without feeling the need to make jump- cuts. The director gives subtle hints regarding the reasons why some of the things happened, but he never explicitly establishes any solid evidence. This actually gives scope for subjective interpretations. This film might be difficult for some people to sit through due to the slow pacing. But if you want to watch a film where every actor is at the top of his/her power and if you want to watch a film where the director allows the story to progress effortlessly without feeling the need to resort to clich√©s, then Foxcatcher is a must watch.Even though Bennet Miller gives enough hints throughout the film to allow the viewer to make up his/her mind about why the things happened as they did, but above all the film also establishes the idea, that at the end of the day, some things that humans do can defy all logic and explanations.",9,1,1,6 March 2015
Gone Girl," All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players !!!!!!
","I have always been a huge admirer of David Fincher. He is undoubtedly one of the most consistent and masterful storytellers in modern cinema. I also think when it comes to dark, disturbing thrillers, there is very few who can match the directorial skills of Fincher. Like many of his previous films, Gone Girl is a very long film, but in a true Fincher-esque fashion, it is as engaging as possible without any scope for the viewer to feel bored. The pacing is perfect. The scenes have a dreamy style to it, which brings the dilemma of 'whether this is a true account of things or has this been made up by the narrator.' The theme of the film is the fact that humans at the basic level are all actors and pretenders. Very seldom do we decide to be our real selves. Generally all of us put on a mask to make ourselves look good in front of the general public and also to pretend to be the person that our nearest and dearest want us to be. Gillian Flynn's screenplay based on her own novel is brilliant and it is also a damning indictment of how media can shape and mould mass perception and it is also a cynical account of the institution of marriage.Ben Affleck is good, Tyler Perry is good, but this movie from an acting perspective belongs to Rosamund Pike. She owns every scene that she is in and delivers an Oscar-worthy performance.Fincher has once again has made a fantastic film. The last 30 minutes might not be completely logical, but it is still symbolic. If you are about to get married,stay away from Gone Girl.",9,144,229,19 December 2014
Ex Machina," The distortion of distinctions !!!
","There have been many films made by many well known directors over the years that deal with the whole concept and phenomenon of 'Artificial Intelligence' or AI. Some are great, some are not so good. Ex Machina written and directed by first time director Alex Garland is another film that can be added to that list and it deserves all the acclaim that it has received from the critics' circles. Ex Machina basically is a very personal and intimate film involving very few actors. But the ambitious nature of the script is apparent by analysing what the limited characters in the film stand for and represent. The script has so much to say and it is so layered and directed so well, that it is tough to believe that this is Garland's first film. There are a variety of themes that are at play. Garland talks about the new Godlike status that technology and technological entrepreneurs have obtained in this day and age. They throw technology at us and the general population gets hooked. But Garland in a way is of the opinion that maybe it's not the technology that gets tested by people, but it is the other way round. It is the general population that gets treated like test subjects for technological experiments in this 21st century market. Alex Garland challenges the viewer to put him/herself in the Robot Ava's shoes and decide whether 'her' actions are truly mechanical and completely devoid of humanity or whether they are not very different from the actions of us humans without really giving an answer and hence he makes a comment about how human beings may be slowly losing the humanity which separates them from other living beings. But the great thing is, he manages to convey these lofty messages without ever being preachy or sentimental. The film has a very understated and hypnotic quality about it that intrigued me. The film's theme of the distortion of distinctions between man and machine reminded me very much of Blade Runner and that too in the best way possible. There are also themes of anti-establishment and subtle elements of feminism that are inherent in the narrative. The acting is stupendous from all the three main characters involved. Domhnall Gleeson efficiently portrays the naive and idealistic nature of his character Caleb who has the best intentions but who is also oblivious of the game being played at his expense. Alicia Vikander plays the robot 'Ava' which is being tested for Artificial Intelligence. Playing a robot can be very challenging. Sometimes the intentionally mechanical and impassive nature of the character can lead to the performance being boring or sometimes even laughable. But Vikander uses the right amount of subtlety with her facial gestures and mixes them with the general robotic gestures and gives a very convincing performance. But for me the best performance in the film comes from Oscar Isaac who plays the mysterious Nathan. He looks muscular and exudes this masculine aura which makes him intimidating . His character never allows you to make your mind up about him till the ultimate denouement. Ex Machina is a great debut film from Alex Garland. It is thematically complex and deserves multiple viewings and I am sure that more elements of the screenplay will become perceivable to me when I'll watch it again. I really don't have anything negative to say about it. Ex Machina is an artistic, multi-layered sci-fi classic.",10,6,11,26 May 2015
La Grande Illusion," Humanism that transcends all barriers !!!
","'La Grande Illusion' is one of those films that reaffirm a film lover's belief that cinema as an art form can be used by filmmakers to bring people together. The screenplay for the film written by Renoir and Charles Spaak is extremely deep and multi layered. Although the film is set during the WW1 era, the timing of the making and release of the film is very important. This was released when the Nazi party in Germany was becoming more and more powerful and another global war was imminent. I can't help but think that this film was Renoir's attempt to make people stray away from the extremism that they were getting influenced by. Although it didn't achieve its intended objective, one can't help but admire the artist's intentions.If one has to summarise 'La Grande Illusion' in one phrase, I think the phrase to be used is 'the power of humanism'. Renoir loves every single character in the film. Not just the French soldiers, even the German soldiers get treated with respect. The Germans are not stereotypical caricatures as is found in some other films of this era. The German officers treat their French prisoners with kindness. This shows Renoir understood that there were ordinary, innocent German people who were caught in the middle of the wars being instigated by the politicians in power. Apart from underlining the humanism and the similarity between the soldiers on all sides, the film also works on other themes. The film explores the changing times. We see the men who have been detached from the outside world due to the war feel surprised when they hear that women are keeping their hair short. One of them equates this appearance with the appearance of a boy. This is clearly Renoir commenting upon the progress women were making at the time in trying to gain equality. We also get the angle of the changing nature of the class distinctions. Rauffenstein and Boeldieu belonged to the higher classes. They understand and respect each other even though they belong to Germany and France respectively. We see them reminisce about the old times and talk about how they feel out of place in a fast changing world where the class distinctions are getting distorted as they embark on an era where people belonging to lower classes as well as Jews will be equal to them. We also get a subtle introspection on the concept of masculinity in this changing society. Renoir through his visuals shows how all the characters are at times literally and at times thematically trapped by the war. We get his signature shots of frames within frame to metaphorically imply that the characters are trapped. Every character, be it French or German is trapped mentally and physically by the war. Even a high officer like Rauffenstein feels trapped in his claustrophobic chamber. They are all detached from the outside world. They want freedom, but are apprehensive about whether they will be ready for what awaits them on the outside once they get their 'freedom'. This internal apprehension of not being ready to live on the outside reminded me of 'The Shawshank Redemption'. Like Powell & Pressburger did with 'The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp', Renoir is bidding farewell to an era where even wars were fought with a gentlemanly attitude. Although he does touch upon the class distinctions and some other aspects that plagued that earlier era, but he is primarily concerned with the humanism of that characters. So, we see the kindness between soldiers belonging to different nations. This can lead to a a criticism that the film is a bit overly romanticised and is a bit of a wish fulfillment exercise as it doesn't depict the brutalities of war. But I think a brutally real account of WW1 was never Renoir's vision. In the midst of the rise of the Nazi Party and the huge possibility of another war, he wanted to make a film that makes the viewers renounce extremism and in the process instill the spirit of a unified Europe, no matter how unrealistic it may seem. This is why I think 'La Grande Illusion' will work brilliantly as a double feature with Kubrick's 'Paths of Glory'. While the first shows soldiers from different nations treating each other with kindness, the latter shows French officers being monstrously merciless to their own French colleagues.Renoir's visual style is beyond impressive. He uses very little editing in most scenes, instead he constantly keeps moving the camera to reveal other characters in the room or to reveal new parts of the interior which were earlier not visible in the frame. He also uses deep focus effectively to make the visual language of the film very character-inclusive in the sense that all the characters find importance in a scene. This inclusive nature of his style executed by tracking shots is epitomised by the famous scene involving the singing of 'La Marseillaise', a scene where he practically uses no cuts.Performance wise, I'll give special mention to Jean Gabin, Erich von Stroheim and Pierre Fresnay. 'La Grande Illusion' is a film that I can watch over and over again and get something new out of it on each viewing. It is rich in humanism, thematic depth and Renoir's brilliant directorial skills. The title of the film itself is layered and open to many interpretations. What was the grand illusion? Is it the illusion that one can achieve freedom from the suffering by escaping from prison camps or is it the illusion that the world that awaits these soldiers after the war ends will be the same as the one that they left behind? Or is war itself the grand illusion that creates barriers between human beings who are all the same, but get divided based on geographical borders? Maybe it is one of them, maybe it is all of them.",9,5,5,9 September 2016
Sing Street," Rock n' Roll is a Risk !!!
","'Sing Street' is set in 1980s Ireland. Right at the beginning of the film we are given footage of a news reel showing numerous Irish people leaving their deadbeat lives in Ireland to look for a new life in England. This little bit of footage actually establishes the overall binding theme of the film. This desire to leave the dying, hopeless economy of Ireland to go somewhere with more scope has a direct connection with the life of our protagonist Connor. His parents' marriage is on the rocks and on the verge of collapse. He and his siblings are living a depressed existence with no sense of freedom. Connor gets transferred to a Catholic school. Although initially he gets bullied in his new school, but later on he finds some new friends who share his love for music and they help Connor in forming the band 'Sing Street' in order to impress the girl Raphina that Connor becomes deeply infatuated with.The only other John Carney film I had seen before is 'Once' which I think is a masterpiece. 'Sing Street' is very different in style to 'Once'. While 'Once' has a raw, stripped down style of storytelling, 'Sing Street' has a much more upbeat, energetic style which kind of reminded me of the 2014 film 'Pride'. The upbeat style of the film's screenplay and style of direction embody the spirit of Connor and his teenage friends who also want to make their presence felt. Just like the people flocking to England to have a promising future, Connor also isn't contented with his present life and wants to do something with his life and pursue his love which is music. He doesn't know what awaits him on the other side if he pursues what he wishes to, but his romantic teenage heart is willing to take that risk and break free.The relationship between Connor and his brother Brandon was beautiful and in a way the heart of the whole film. Through the backstories and other hints that are given, it is implied that Connor is the spiritual successor of Brandon. Once upon a time, Brandon had also found himself in the same position that Connor finds himself in. He also wanted to escape the metaphoric prison and live his life the way he wants to, but unfortunately couldn't. In the film Connor is standing at that same crossroad where he wants to escape the suffocating oppression of his teachers, the depressing state of his family life and go away along with his special girl Raphina to live their dreams. Brandon is a a very likable character, one can easily understand him, his opinions and his decisions. The way he helps Connor is nothing short of heartwarming. It is because of the existence of this loving brotherly relationship between Connor and Brandon that I think 'Sing Street' can be used brilliantly in a double feature with Ken Loach's 'Kes'. 'Kes' is another film where the protagonist Billy tries to escape the grim and depressing reality of his life through his pet bird. But instead of being loving, his older brother is adversarial which beautifully contrasts the relationship between Connor and Brandon in 'Sing Street'.The romance between Connor and Raphina felt cute and believable. The chemistry between the boys of the bands also felt great. Apart from his real brother Brandon, Connor's relationship with the members of his band especially Eamon felt very tender and sweet.John Carney uses flashy directing techniques here to complement the rebellious teenage spirit of the characters. We see rapid use of zoom, 360 degree shot that transitions into another scene, a whole fantasy-like sequence that almost felt like it was from another movie,etc. This completely contrasts the toned down approach in 'Once', but considering the subject of the film, the upbeat tone is perfect.The acting is great from everyone involved. The actors give three dimensional performances. They are funny, likable and relateable. Special mention has to be given to Ferdia Walsh-Peelo, Jack Reynor and Lucy Boynton.If I can find a flaw in the film, I'll say that the music in the film, although being great to listen to, sounds a bit unrealistically professional which took me out of the film at times. I know that this is a feelgood film which at times flirts with elements of fantasy, but I think the quality of the music could have been intentionally lowered a bit and for me, it would have made the film even more personal and intimate and lovable.Overall, the film is really enjoyable. It is funny, emotional, thought-provoking and has a big heart. It pays a tribute to all brothers all over the world. The romance between the leads is cute and believable. It didn't move me as much as 'Once', but it is certainly a worthy entry in Carney's filmography.",8,1,2,21 August 2016
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Legends become tangible Human Beings !!!
","In my review of 'The Force Awakens', I wrote that the major theme of the film was the reaffirmation of the myths and the legends of Star Wars. The irony is that the sequel, 'The Last Jedi' stands on the opposite end of the thematic spectrum. This film is all about the subversion and the deconstruction of the myths, the legends and the force. If 'The Force Awakens' is 'Stagecoach' or Leone's Westerns, then 'The Last Jedi' is a revisionist Western like 'The Searchers' or 'McCabe & Mrs. Miller'. We get to see some beloved characters as tangible, flawed human beings instead of the flawless idea of them as legends. Luke Skywalker's arc and storyline in the film is absolutely brilliant. Johnson doubles down on underlining Luke's dilemmas, insecurities and fears. To me, Luke's descension from the status of the legendary Jedi Knight/Master to being a vulnerable human being made him all the more admirable. Johnson deconstructs the character of Luke, but never disrespects him. But as a non-hardcore Star Wars fanatic, I can clearly see how my opinions regarding Rian Johnson's choice with Luke's character might not be the same as the opinions of a die hard Star Wars fan. For me, this is the first time that a Star Wars film has completely committed to delving deep in the murkiness that lies between the broad strokes of the light and the dark. I loved the explanations given regarding the origins of Kylo Ren's decisions. The film shows how a small moment of weakness viewed from differing perspectives can lead to misunderstandings and subsequently potentially devastating eventualities. I loved everything that Johnson did to connect the three characters of Rey, Kylo and Luke together.
Even though there are a lot of things I liked about 'The Last Jedi', it still has some problems. Apart from Rey and Kylo, the other new characters that were introduced in 'The Force Awakens' either get very little to do, or are burdened with tasks and missions that just didn't grab my interest at all. The plot machinations towards the end of the second half get a little too messy and haphazard. There are also a few too many contrivances and Deus ex Machina moments to drive the plot forward.
Another thing that sticks out in the film might not really be a problem at all, but it is worth mentioning. Rian Johnson tries to undermine the significance of destiny, lineage and determinism. However considering certain circumstances, certain powers that some characters possess, this might just lead to some potential contradictions. I'm interested in seeing how the existence of these powers by the relevant characters get explained/explored in Episode 9.
Visually , the film not only harkens back to the visual style of the original trilogy, but also to classic Japanese Samurai films(which were the primary influence on Lucas in the first place). There are shots that reminded me of Yojimbo, Harakiri, Sword of Doom, etc. There is a particular wide angle shot in the third act of the film that looked like it was straight out of Kurosawa's 'Ran'. The cinematography has to be admired. Despite the inherent darkening of the screen due to the 3D glasses, the colours on the screen popped and the world looked magical and alluring.
In terms of acting performances, Mark Hamill steals the show. He adds so much depth in his performance and beautifully portrays Luke as a changed older man. The performances from the rest of the cast is good, but Hamill's performance is great.
Even though 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' has its flaws, I can confidently say from a completely subjective standpoint that no other film in the Star Wars series has made me ponder over its themes and think about the characters as much as this one has. Rian Johnson's choices might distance the hardcore Star Wars loyalists, but as a neutral film fan who has always been a casual admirer of Star Wars, this film really compelled me.",8,1,5,21 December 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy," The Avengers on crack !!!!
","When I heard the name 'Guardians of the Galaxy' and then heard that it was another Marvel film, I couldn't help but feel that it was going to be another one of those quintessential Marvel films. I don't dislike them,but the frequency of their releases has started to get on my nerves, and also the fact that most of them have become monotonous and similar in structure and content has made me slightly indifferent about them. Fortunately I was wrong in this case.Guardians of the Galaxy is one of those grand summer blockbusters that lets you relax without demanding too much introspection, however it remains witty,really funny and never becomes uninteresting. It is a film that knows what it is which is a popcorn blockbuster and it works brilliantly. The main reason why it works is the non- serious style in which James Gunn has directed this film. There is no forced seriousness, no contrived sentiments for the most parts and the humour is fantastic. There are conversations that had me belly laughing. The story is well written and cgi work is great(as is expected from a Marvel film). What elevates the film to the next level is the quality of the characters. The main characters namely Peter, Gomora, Rocket, Groot and Dax are all likable, memorable characters with their own distinguishing personalities and identities. The voice- over job done by Bradley Cooper is fabulous. Chris Pratt is fantastic as Peter or the 'outlaw' Star-lord, Zoe Saldana puts in another solid performance in a sci-fi film, Batista also did well with the limited acting experience that he has.The script is magnificent. The writers went all the way to make the film as funny as it possibly could be. Yes there are a number of conveniences and it might have been a problem in a different film, but for a film like this whose sole purpose is to entertain the crap out of you and do it in such a witty,funny way, I am willing to overlook them. The only negative is that the character of the villain could have been more developed and more intimidating.Guardians of the Galaxy can be described as a witty,funny and devilishly sarcastic brother of The Avengers. I had read an article where The Avengers were called The Beatles of Marvel and Guardians of the Galaxy,The Rolling Stones. All i can say is that I have always preferred the Stones over the Beatles.",9,1,6,21 November 2014
The Imitation Game," Compelling story marred by an overly melodramatic approach !!!!
","The positives are Benedict Cumberbatch (of course) and a non-linear screenplay which is innovative(for a biopic).The film made me aware of a great man whose unbelievable achievements and gifts to mankind I was completely unaware of(as were most viewers).But the problem with the film for me is the style of storytelling and direction. In order to make this a film suitable for everyone in the family,the director almost completely took off all the hard edges of the storyline which made the film look like a TV film. There are too many clich√©d characters like the ones played by Charles Dance,Keira Knightley,etc. It reminded me of 'A Beautiful Mind' although that was a much better film. It is just too melodramatic and abundant with Hollywood clich√©s almost reminiscent of The King's Speech. It is still a good film, but I expected much more from a movie that has been lauded by so many critics. However, its sappy,sugarcoated nature will make it a contender at the Oscars.",7,2,6,9 January 2015
Logan," The Legend of Wolverine/Logan !!!
","The R-rated comic book movie as a concept isn't as new as some think it is. Be it the 'Blade' films or 'Kickass', bloody comic book movies have existed before too. But in modern pop culture due to the somewhat homogenization of the comic-book genre due to the big bloated cgi- heavy spectacle filmmaking that the audience has been subjected to with the MCU and other franchises, when Deadpool was released, it became a major box-office success. 'Deadpool' was deemed to be a representation of what could be done with the super-hero genre. However while 'Deadpool' was about dissecting the super-hero genre in a meta- comedic, self referential way with a heavy dose of juvenile humour, 'Logan' is about dissecting the super-hero genre by attempting to add a sense of maturity to the films by introducing elements of existentialism and mortality, themes which most comic book/super- hero films of this era tend to shy away from confronting or exploring in a serious way. There is a scene in 'Logan' in which Logan, Laura and Professor X are trying to escape from a group of men in their car(limo). During that scene, there is a moment where Logan tries to ram the car through a steel fence. In a general MCU film, he would've been able to successfully ram it through the fence and get away. In 'Deadpool', he would've again managed to do it successfully, but this time it would've been followed by a self-referential joke about how that shouldn't have happened in a realistic sense, but since this is a comic- book film, anything is allowed. However in 'Logan' not only does he NOT manage to ram the car through the fence, the steel grills get awkwardly stuck near the front wheels of the car. That moment in the film visually represents the mature sense of slightly elevated realism that 'Logan' is striving for. The film and its themes work to a great extent due to the performances. Hugh Jackman has always been good as Wolverine, but this is probably his best performance as the aforementioned mutant. His general demeanour, physical appearance and overall presence exude a sense of world-weariness, a sense of exhaustion and emotional surrender complementing the usual rugged, hard-boiled grit that Jackman is known for in his Wolverine portrayals. The father- son-like dynamics between Sir Patrick Stewart's Professor X and Logan felt very realistic in the way they constantly bicker and argue even though there is a clear sense of mutual love simmering beneath. Daphne Keen is also very good as Laura. 'Logan' keeping in tune with 'Deadpool' attempts to be meta to some extent. There is a moment where Logan pulls up an X-men comic book and talks about how the comic books fabricate reality and add sensationalism to make everything look magical. He specifically states that in real life, people die unlike the make-believe world of comic books. This might make someone believe that the director James Mangold is trying to completely sever all ties that the film might have with its comic book roots. But with the way the concept of Eden gets played out here, Mangold makes sure that he pays a tribute to the feeling of hope, wonder and fantasy that comic books can offer to the minds of the readers.Having said all that, I don't think the film is flawless. There are a number of moments where the film unnecessarily reverts back to some conventional comic-book tropes and simplistic conveniences which somewhat undercut the mature sense of gritty filmmaking that Mangold is trying to attempt to pull off. There is a very cheesy use of mobile phone footage for exposition. The film itself does feel like a revisionist neo-western in the way it balances both the destruction as well as the reassertion of myths. However there are some very explicit and unsubtle western references made here to drive home that link which felt really clumsy and contrived. The film devotes so much effort in underlining how unlike comic books, in real life all the physical conflicts and fights have physical as well as morally triggered emotional consequences. However Mangold betrays some of that very theme by upping the cool quotient in many of the fight scenes with Logan and Laura slicing up and devouring faceless thugs. Even the reveal of the main villain that Logan has to go up against in the eventual fight initially felt a little hokey, but pondering over it later on made me come to somewhat accept it since it serves a metaphorical purpose in the narrative.So it might seem like there were a lot of things in the film that I didn't like which might make the 8/10 rating seem contradictory. The generous rating is mainly down to the fact that I love the idea of the film and its ambition and what it wanted to achieve, and I believe to a great extent did. It's such a refreshing aberration to see a modern comic book movie that doesn't end with a portal in the sky or a video game like virtual fight. It felt good to see a film about such a beloved comic book character have the guts to be just about that, the characters, instead of spectacle and special effects. The admiration that I have for the film has made me to some extent overlook some of the elements in it which to me are flaws. Big Recommendation.",8,3,7,9 October 2017
A Clockwork Orange," Kubrick lays down the morality trap !!!
","'A Clockwork Orange' is violent, it's brutal, but what it's not is a film that glorifies its violence as many critics and audiences believe it does. Every scene of violence, however ugly it may be, serves a purpose thematically. The violence is often accompanied by playful classical/modern music. I think the music and playful tone of the scenes directly express the allure that violence holds in the minds of youngsters like Alex. An important aspect to be noted in the violent scenes is the lack of blood or the lack of shots showing the after-effects of violence. It's just unreasonable violence. But the lack of logic behind the committing of these violent acts and the playful tone of the scenes will make the viewer question why violence is so alluring to Alex and his 'droogs'. Why does he get stimulated by the prospect of harming others? Is Alex a bad seed, is he naturally 'evil'? Now although this question is not directly answered, there are hints and imagery littered throughout the film that suggest otherwise. In the movie, Kubrick depicts a society around Alex that cannot completely wash its hands off the crimes of Alex and claim absolution from the guilt of giving rise to boys like him. Kubrick implicitly hints towards the existence of elements like parental neglect and abuse, the insidious hypocrisy of authority figures like Mr.Deltoid, governmental impotence in dealing with and thereby curbing vandalism and criminal activity, systemic fascism and an overall societal apathy leading to perennial decadence. These elements underline the notion that Alex in spite of his demonic actions and tendencies might not be naturally evil and he might not be the sole person to blame. Alex is a product of the society that he lives in and of course a product of the government that 'protects' him.On one hand, Kubrick opens up the discussion in the social context, but at the same time, he manages to convincingly condense the discussion to a personal level too. This is because the questions of morality that this film asks will be viewed and remarked upon differently by every viewer based on their own sensibilities. After Alex undergoes the Ludovico Technique and gets completely stripped of his right to choose, everything that comes up in the film subsequently involves Kubrick making the audience ask themselves the tough central question: Should I feel sorry for Alex? This is the sequence where the extensively wild nature of Alex's 'ultra- violence' in the first half of the film achieves further relevance and purpose. Had Kubrick not had the proverbial 'balls' to show Alex at his worst in his violent days in the most visceral manner possible, the viewer's dilemma while seeing Alex suffer after undergoing the experiment, would've somewhat lost its potency. It is interesting to note that there is a reference made in the film about the distinctions between the Old Testament and the New Testament of the Bible. I think this is pertinent, because anyone who sides with the Old Testament's 'eye for an eye' attitude towards wrong-doers will retain their contempt towards Alex even during his moments of extreme suffering and will not sympathise with him. They will support the experiment due to the result offered by it which is the eradication of the criminal instinct, even if it means making Alex undergo inhuman treatment. But anyone who sides with the New Testament's far more liberal attitude towards wrong-doers, will sympathise with Alex and protest against the government's totalitarian decision to strip him of his humanity instead of giving him the time to redeem himself on his own. Opting in favour of the experiment means the dehumanisation of criminals who after all are still human beings. While being patient and allowing the criminal in prison to correct himself from within and then allowing him to go out into the world again, involves risking the prospect of releasing potential ticking bombs into the world who can easily revert back to their darker selves. Kubrick severely tests each and every viewer's dedication and conviction to their beliefs, no matter which side of the divide the viewer falls on with regards to the questions of morality. I appreciate the fact that unlike the original novel, Kubrick leaves the question answered without allowing Alex any sort of redemption in the end and thereby not allowing the viewer any reprieve either. He presents the problem, but doesn't present a solution to the problem because a universal, all encompassing solution to such a complex issue might not be so easily available in the first place. The relevance of the issue of capital punishment in our current times proves how even today, these issues remain unresolved. The more overarching social problems explored in the film are easier to locate and take care of, compared to the central issue of morality and the inherent subjectivity involved.'A Clockwork Orange' has the distinctive Kubrickian austerity to it. The camera placements, the intricate detailing of the sets to juxtapose futuristic advancements with dystopian decadence, the symmetrical visual compositions, the extensive use of wide angle lens, the extreme idiosyncrasies of the characters, the darkly comic tone,etc. everything screams out the name Kubrick. Now, let's talk about Malcolm McDowell. This is one of the most uninhibited portrayals of a despicable character in film history. He prances around like a peacock owning every minute. There is an intensity to him that complements Kubrick's style perfectly. McDowell's version of the 'Kubrick stare' which the film starts off with might be my favourite and the most iconic of them all. Wendy Carlos' score for the film is dark, hypnotic and again works brilliantly with Kubrick's visual style. Kubrick himself was a master when it comes to using music to underline mood and tone. Just like 2001, he makes optimum use of classical music and the music is in itself a character in the film.This is one of the easiest recommendations that I can ever make.",10,3,4,29 June 2017
Reservoir Dogs," A visceral, violent Situational Comedy
","'Reservoir Dogs' was Quentin Tarantino's directorial debut and immediately he showed what he was capable of. He made critics and audiences sit up and notice. The plot of the film follows a group of criminals as they try to identify the rat among them after a botched jewellery store heist.First of all, there may be many individuals who might accuse this film of being high on style and low on substance and I won't completely disagree with them, but when the style is so viscerally mesmerising, I am willing to forgive the slight lack of thematic depth. A huge chunk of the film takes place inside a warehouse sporadically interrupted by flash backs which give us a little background on some of the characters. These scenes in the warehouse considering the context of the plot are absolutely riveting and they pretty much make the film feel like a play at times. The palpable tension in these scenes reminded me a lot of 'Dog Day Afternoon'. The main theme of this film I think is identity. The characters in the film don't know anything about each other including the names. All they know is that they have to professionally carry out a job by trusting each other and working as a team. The audience is also put in a similar position. We don't get to know too much about any of the characters either. We are always kept at a distance intentionally. However we can get some glimpses of the nature and characteristics of certain characters through some of the dialogue and some of their behaviour, but even then it's only glimpses. Throughout the film we see roles being reversed. Genuine bad guys asking each other and trying to figure out who the 'bad guy' among them is, we see a bit of a role reversal in an interrogation scene leading to gory torture, we see good guys doing bad things along with bad guys to win their trust,etc. This film is also a quintessential 90s film. The flashback scenes outside of the warehouse ooze the gritty nature of 90s L.A. with the street graffiti, the crime and the rugged streets, etc. The story is in a way simple, but in the simplicity we see how the lives of criminals ultimately fall apart.I have always felt that Scorsese and Tarantino's directorial styles are somewhat similar. They both have no problems in using bloody violence, they employ deft ways to pay tribute to the films that inspired them in their films, they use music in their films in a very artistic and contextual way and they make films that can be deemed to be 'cool'. All this can be found in 'Reservoir Dogs'. The soundtrack of this film is absolutely fantastic. It brilliantly complements the 'cool'-ness of the visuals. Tarantino likes his set pieces and there are two absolutely brilliantly directed set pieces in this film that gave me goosebumps. The screenplay has to be admired a lot too as it is the screenplay that complements the direction and in a way lays down the scope for Tarantino to create and tension in the film.The acting is brilliant from all involved. There are some lengthy single takes which allow the actors to really go for it and I noticed a lot of method acting throughout especially from Keitel and Buscemi. Keitel, Buscemi and Roth are the ones that impressed me the most. 'Reservoir Dogs' might not be the most deep film that I have ever seen, but I still consider it to be a masterpiece. This is a film where a rookie director showed us his skills behind the camera and gave us an entry to a style of filmmaking that later became a standard to which films made by other directors with similar style came to be compared and being called 'Tarantino-esque'. Yes it is at times self- indulgent, but it still is a visceral experience and one of the best directorial debuts in film history that should never be missed by film lovers.",10,0,0,28 August 2015
Don't Breathe," A brilliant directed, riveting thriller !!!
","The central theme lying at the heart of 'Don't Breathe' is the sense of claustrophobia, a sense of being trapped/imprisoned. The director shows us a number of appropriate images like window bars, bars outside gates, prison like shadows being cast by Venetian blinds,etc. to drive home the theme. This theme resonates both in a literal sense with the kids being imprisoned in the house that they had planned to rob in the first place, as well as on a broader symbolic level because it is made clear that these youngsters aspire to break out of the 'prison' of life in a financially ailing Detroit and head for California. This film at the heart of it is an exploitation film and certain details get revealed with the passage of time that in keeping with the genre of exploitation cinema, flirt with lack of realism and force you to suspend disbelief a bit. But what made it very easy for me to suspend disbelief and go along with the ride was Fede Alvarez's direction. Without his masterful directorial skills and storytelling, this film will not work, full stop. He elevates the film. The Giallo inspired visual texture that he uses with the red and green neon lights not just makes the film look vibrant, but also serves a thematic purpose. His camera is extremely active and he makes use of space in the interiors of the house skilfully. He uses extended long takes to raise the tension and his use of ambient noises and music is subtle and brilliant. The very first shot of the film itself is masterful in the way the camera moves from an overhead position gradually to a ground level one to reveal what's happening along with a gradual rise in the volume of the music. Stephen Lang has to be admired for his performance. He brings a very raw, masculine physicality to his demeanour that truly makes him terrifying at times.I think this is one of the best directed horror/thriller films I have seen for some time. It doesn't spend too much time in developing its characters. Both the sides in the conflict are not worth unconditional sympathy. The youngsters are low time criminals and the blind man is not someone worth sympathy either once certain details about his life and mental condition get revealed. I guess it was intentional on the director's part to stage the film with a degree of moral ambiguity where the viewer doesn't fully care for either of the two parties and in the end it works within the exploitation film framework. To end, I'll say 'Don't Breathe' is a film that I would recommend more for the direction than for the script itself.",8,71,122,18 December 2016
Sicario," 'American Eyes' witness Hell !!!
","'Sicario' is directed by the critically acclaimed filmmaker Denis Villeneuve and it is based on a screenplay written by Taylor Sheridan. Idealistic FBI agent Kate Macer(Emily Blunt) receives a top assignment when she gets recruited by a mysterious government official Matt Grover(Josh Brolin). Kate ends up joining a task force for the war against drugs. Led by the shadowy Alejandro(Benicio Del Toro), the team travels back and forth across the US-Mexican border with the objective of getting their hands on the top cartel bosses.I have really liked Villeneuve's previous outings as a director. He has already shown that he has his own distinctive style. After watching 'Sicario', his already positive status in my head has been further enhanced and now I can genuinely say that he is one of the best filmmakers working today. Like 'Incendies', Villeneuve captures reality in the most visceral and brutal manner in 'Sicario'. Ju√°rez gets captured in the most realistic and stripped down manner in this film. Roger Deakins' brilliant cinematography seamlessly complements Villeneuve's style. Even though what was being shown was at times downright disturbing, but I couldn't look away due to Villeneuve's command on the art of creating tension and Deakin's beautiful visuals.Another very important aspect of the film to be admired is Taylor Sheridan's deeply meaningful script. Villeneuve allows the depth and the message of the script to come to the forefront by slowing down the pace of the film from time to time. This could have easily descended into a run-of-the-mill standard action thriller, but thankfully Sheridan's themes and Villeneuve's visual flair go hand in hand instead of one overpowering the other. The primary theme of the film is to address the reality of how blind the Americans and people from other 1st world countries can be to the grim realities of the backward nations and the people of these nations. We are unaware of the complexities of the problems that face the world and its people today. The unfortunate truth is that viewing the world's problems in black and white is no longer plausible. Especially when it comes to the drug importation problem, there is no other option but to maybe get our hands dirty by choosing the lesser evil to ensure the existence of some kind of order because eliminating the problem completely is almost impossible under the current situations. It paints a bleak, pessimistic but nevertheless a very poignant picture of the drug situation in the US borders. There is no chance to play by the book because the book itself has become obsolete.Emily Blunt's character represents all of us. She gets thrown into the hell of Ju√°rez and clearly she is not ready to handle the scenes, the events and the revelations that await her there. In the scene where she sees the horror that greets her on her first visit to Ju√°rez, Villenueve used quick close-up shots of Blunt's face in between the sweeping shots of the streets to establish her shock at the sight of everything around her. It almost felt like a baby looking at the world which is unknown to him/her for the first time in amazement. Some critics have panned the film for making Kate a 'weak female character'. I completely disagree with that criticism. I don't think Kate was weak at all. She was a very skilled FBI officer who was idealistic and who wanted to do the 'right' thing by respecting the law in a Serpico- esque way. Even if her character would have been male, it wouldn't have made a difference in my eyes, because the main focus is not her gender, but her nationality and her moral sense in the context of the film. Josh Brolin uses his charisma and presence to make his character Matt quite intriguing. You never quite know what he is up to till the end. But for me the stand-out performance comes from Benicio Del Toro who plays Alejandro, the most mysterious character in the film. This might be Del Toro's best work in quite some time. Every gesture of his exudes control and dynamism. His character gets the most back story in the film and Del Toro excels in expressing the darkness behind those steely, brooding eyes.Overall, I think 'Sicario' is undoubtedly one of the best films of 2015. It has brilliant characters with great actors portraying them. It has a virtuoso director at the helm with a screenplay that has depth. The film is dark, somewhat pessimistic in its themes and will leave the viewer a bit depressed and cold just like the mental condition that Blunt's character Kate descended into towards the end of the film, but that is what the film intends to do. Villeneuve and Sheridan want the viewer to face and experience the same dilemma that Kate goes through towards the end of the film and encounter the hopelessness of the real situation and needless to say they succeed with flying colours.",9,1,2,5 January 2016
Pulp Fiction," Tarantino's Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World !!!
","This is a tour de force of brilliantly precise screen writing, perfect acting, precise camera-work, perfect directing and world class dialogue writing. 'Pulp Fiction' is Tarantino's carnival of funny, but equally abrasive nihilism. This is a film which has a surprisingly firm backbone of morality beneath the crazy and deranged surface. Tarantino is constantly on the lookout for characters who make a choice to turn their back on their meaningless lives of nihilistic violence and look for honour and a purpose. The characters who make that choice are allowed to ride off into the sunset, while the characters who decide to not change and stick to their meaningless cyclical lives of never-ending crime and violence are burdened with unenviable fates. There is a method to the madness. Tarantino makes the film and the characters infinitely rich. However while doing all this, he never stops having fun. There are endless film references, pop culture references and other stuff that signifies the film's self- consciousness which constantly make the viewer feel the fact that they are watching a film, a piece of fiction through Tarantino's eyes and not anything attached to reality.Some people tend to trivialise the structure of the screenplay by calling it a gimmick. But as far as I'm concerned the structure of the screenplay is essential and indispensable in the context of the narrative and in the context of how Tarantino wants to drive home the themes that he is exploring. In a nutshell........ yeah, 'Pulp Fiction' is a masterpiece, it's a bad mother#*%@er.",10,3,6,2 May 2017
Die Hard," Willis vs Rickman !!!!
","This is the first film of the hugely popular action film franchise. The story involves a New York cop named John Mcclane(Bruce Willis) who is coming to California to meet his estranged wife on Christmas Eve at her office. Mcclane comes off as a rugged American cop from the 20th century who can't tolerate the life and the youth of California nor is he very well versed in high culture and art.He is a down to earth fellow who is not pretentious and says what he thinks without much complication. As luck would have it, on that very day i.e. on the Christmas Eve,a gang of German terrorists decide to break into the building and take hostages led by the infamous Hans Gruber played by Alan Rickman. Gruber is suave,sharp and well educated, so pretty much like the opposite of Mcclane. Mcclane gives the terrorists the slip and thus begins one man's fight to outsmart a whole gang of terrorists and save the day.I know this is not the popular opinion, but I found this film very dull. It uses the clich√©d story arc of a main character who has marriage problems and then by using unbelievable bravery in larger than life situations helps save the lives of people and again get into the good books of his wife. There are so many scenes which look unrealistic and cheesy. So many characters in this movie are downright idiots like the Deputy Police Commissioner, the FBI officials, Mcclane's Limo driver,etc. Some of the lines spoken by the Deputy Commissioner are almost laughably silly. I know action film scripts are supposed to have conveniences, but this film takes the benefit of too many of those. The ultimate encounter at the climax of the film ends with another silly set piece that only points to bad writing.However having said that the film has a few things going for it. Bruce Willis and Alan Rickman are extremely good in their roles. Willis completely commits himself to the role physically and successfully sells the desperation of Mcclane's character. Rickman marvelously plays an intelligent and intimidating villain who has the ability to match the wits of our hero at every step. Lastly among the positives it has to be admitted that some of the action scenes and effects were very well executed considering it was the eighties.But overall I found this to be an average action film and had it not been for Willis and Rickman, my rating would have been lower than 5/10. Some people will say that since I have watched so many films that have come after Die Hard which have used the plots and techniques used originally by Die Hard,I might not be able to appreciate the movie as much as I should, but I completely dismiss that thought. Seinfeld is a sitcom whose material has been used and reused in so many other sitcoms later, but when I still watch Seinfeld it looks and feels as witty and as sharp as ever. But unfortunately Die Hard doesn't pass that test. If this is the best out of all the films in the franchise, then sadly I have to bid farewell to John Mcclane as I am not interested in checking out the sequels anymore. Our paths won't converge again in the future.",5,8,15,27 October 2014
Rosemary's Baby," A mother and her baby !!!
","'Rosemary's Baby' is perhaps the most popular and well known Roman Polanski film after 'Chinatown'. The film is based on a novel of the same name by Ira Levin and it's the 2nd film in Polanski's 'Apartment Trilogy'. The film is about a married couple - Rosemary and Guy Woodhouse who move into the Bramford, a Manhattan apartment. They get introduced to a nosy and odd neighbouring couple - The Castevets who start intruding in their lives a lot. Finally when Rosemary gets pregnant, she starts becoming more and more suspicious about the neighbours as well as her husband.Polanski had already made 'Repulsion' in 1965 which was the 1st film in his 'Apartment Trilogy' and his 1st film in the English language. But 'Rosemary's Baby' was his first big-budget film and this was also the 1st big-budget Hollywood horror film. But like a true product of its time, it still had the audacity to have ambiguity as one of its qualities unlike the big-budget Hollywood studio productions of the current era. Like 'Repulsion', this film can also be interpreted in many different ways.The first way to interpret it will be to view it as a work on female liberation. This was made in the 60s when the feminist movement was finally starting to have some impact. One can view the film and opine that Polanski is showing how a woman is being dominated by others and others' opinions are being forced upon her during her pregnancy when all the decisions should rest with her. She starts becoming more and more distant from her husband due to the fact even he fails to understand her mindset and starts dominating her.The second way to interpret the film will be to take everything literally. The viewer can decide to not go too much into subtexts and themes and take the film for what it is and get immersed in this interesting story of a woman and her pregnancy. The third way to interpret the film will be to view it as an allegory on how women can seem excessively paranoid and whimsical during pregnancy from a male point of view.The fourth way to interpret it will be to view the film as the struggle of a woman with a Catholic background to adjust herself to the new and changing society of the 1960s, a decade during which non-conformism and counterculture became a craze. Her paranoia gets the better of her and she begins to fear the prospect of bringing a new child to a world and a society which is straying away from her beliefs and so she tries to distance herself and her unborn baby from all folks that she suspects to have 'questionable' beliefs and faiths.The beauty of the screenplay written by Polanski himself, is that it facilitates all the interpretations that can be possible. The screenplay is open and provides hints and scopes for viewers to take the film and accept in their own way. I especially loved the ending of the film as I think it is a beautiful tribute to mothers and motherly love.Another very important aspect of the film is the style of storytelling. Polanski uses surrealism with some dream sequences that are truly weird and effective. Just like 'Repulsion', Polanski blurs the distinctions between what is real and what is being imagined by using a paranoid and sort of unreliable narrator as the whole film is from the point of view of Rosemary who is in pretty much every scene.Mia Farrow is absolutely brilliant as the titular Rosemary. She looks incredibly gaunt and petite in the film to underline her fragility. She beautifully pulls off the transition from being sweet and gullible to being flat out paranoid. I also loved Ruth Gordon as Minnie Castevet. She richly deserved the Oscar that she won for this role. She is dynamite in every scene she is in. She puts in a method performance so brilliantly that the viewer is always guessing whether to believe her or not.'Rosemary's Baby' is a very influential horror film. It uses psychological horror to explore deeper themes without resorting to cheap scares, but it still is pretty disturbing. This film is an absolute masterpiece which I can't recommend highly enough.",10,3,5,14 September 2015
A Hard Day's Night," Look Out, Here They Come !!!
","Directed by Richard Lester and written by Alun Owen, 'A Hard Day's Night' is a comedy musical film starring John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr playing themselves. The plot although is fictional, however the life of the 'fab four' depicted in this film couldn't have been too far away from the reality at the time which was the height of 'Beatlemania'.The concept of popular musicians starring in films is certainly not uncommon. But on most occasions, those outings turn out to be a shoddy attempt to make money by exploiting the popularity of the stars. This could have been a similar case considering the low budget assigned for the production of the film. But Alun Owen's great screenplay and specially Richard Lester's tour-de-force direction elevates the film from just being a showcase for The Beatles' music to levels of greatness.As far as I am concerned the basic theme of Owen's screenplay is the exuberance of youth and the yearning for freedom/liberty. Instead of making the 'fab four' play righteous heroes, the script makes them play themselves in order to make a social commentary in a subtle way. Like in real life, the Beatles in the film also exist in Britain at a very significant time when the old somewhat Victorian-esque ways of authority and customs were starting to be gradually obliterated by the youth of the 'swinging sixties'. This rift between the old and the new gets portrayed extensively in the film like the encounter between older posh gentleman and the beatles in the train compartment or the moment when an older man asks the gang to get off his private property after their wild craziness. The members of the band in the film are youngsters who want to do what they want to do without having to be answerable to anybody. Their manager almost gets driven mad by the lack of discipline of the group which is another metaphor for defying the restrictions and refusing to get dictated by the elders. The wild girls going crazy for the Beatles and trying to get close to them by escaping the police and the security is their way to become non-conformists by embracing the boys who represented their idea of self liberation. An interesting aspect of the film is the character of Paul's grandfather. Although based on his age, he belongs to the older generation, but he actually is a young naughty troublemaker in an old man's body. He represents the kind of character that the 'fab four' would be like in their old days if they don't change.For me, what makes this film a classic is Richard Lester's direction. He really adds the energy to the film. Some of the scenes have become very famous due to the directing techniques that were used to capture them. Lester's direction in the film is certainly heavily influenced by the style of the French New Wave. We see a whole array of intricate directorial tools like repeated jump cuts, Cin√©ma v√©rit√© style of cinematography in the street scenes to give a documentary feel, we see extended overhead shots, sequences with speeded up motion, etc. There are also some shots in the film where the characters wink at the camera a bit which is also a slight homage to the French New Wave. All these intricacies get put together and used brilliantly by Richard Lester to tell the story in a manner which goes with the themes and the nature of the characters. I think Lester's direction makes the film transcend genres. It has elements of a documentary, a musical, and a slapstick comedy all together. This must have to some extent influenced 'This is Spinal Tap'.Although John, Paul, George and Ringo are clearly not the best of actors but they certainly add the wild charm and likability that is needed. What can never be denied is that they are funny together. Paul making fun of Ringo's dancing or John having funny arguments with their manager or George's weird encounter with the fashion moguls are examples of scenes where the easy-going but effective comedy comes to the forefront. I have nothing to say about their music. It is absolutely fantastic, both the slower tracks as well as the faster ones, but one will expect that.Apart from the social commentary in the script and the uninhibited direction, I really want to drive home the fact that this film is bloody funny. I can watch it over and over again due to its vibrant energy and its easily likable comedy. This really is a Rock n' Roll Musical of the highest order and it does cinematic justice to the legacy of the Beatles instead of just exploiting their fame.",9,0,1,22 February 2016
The Wolf of Wall Street," I want you to deal with your problems by becoming Rich !!!
","The Wolf of Wall Street is about the real life character Jordan Belfort who used to be a big Wall Street broker who engaged in illegal activities during the 80s and got himself arrested. The film is based on the book of the same name written by Belfort himself. Like Scarface, this film involves a character who comes from a humble background, a 'former member of the middle class'as he is called in the film, but who has huge ambitions and a relentlessly fierce vigour to become a big-shot and become rich. It is quite clear that under the circumstances that Jordan has grown up in, money is something that he views as a God and so when he arrives at Wall Street to work for his first brokerage firm, he feels a sense of fulfillment. Another film that I was really reminded of was 'Goodfellas'. A thematic connection between the two films can be made by one line from each film. In Goodfellas, Henry Hill says 'I always wanted to be a gangster' and in The Wolf of Wall Street, Belfort says 'I always wanted to be rich' and these two lines tell you everything that you need to know about these two characters.However this film isn't really about Wall Street and the stock market. It is really about addiction and the perils of uncontrolled ambition. But like pretty much all of Scorsese's films, this is not at all preachy or melodramatic. Scorsese portrays the vulgar, obscene antics involving drugs and hookers and the unrestricted misogyny of Belfort and his partners in an unapologetic manner. Many people have complained about the fact that the style of storytelling is exaggerated, over-the-top, and extremely loud. But it is clear that this is intentionally so. The film about such obscenely undisciplined individuals has to be equally undisciplined and loud, because otherwise the whole point of effectively portraying the excessive nature of their actions gets lost. However Scorsese still uses some scenes to make us not empathise, but understand why these people feel the need to act like this. When Belfort has the conversation with Mark Hanna, a senior partner of the firm that he starts to work for after arriving at Wall Street played by Matthew McConaughey, it is clear that he wasn't as hollow as he became later, but McConaughey's character acts like the character of Mephistopheles and gives him all the advice and tips which Belfort absorbs and ends up selling his soul to the devil. We also see Belfort himself then taking up the role of Mephistopheles and alluring others into this mad world of stock broking. Although the film uses the concept of excess in a lot of ways, but Scorsese still manages to use some tender scenes to somehow humanise this character of Belfort who seems so inhuman, like the scene where Belfort shifts his focus to stealing from the rich instead of the poor because that was what his wife asked him to do, or the scene where we get to know why he hired an employee called Kimmie. Belfort was once a human, but he was seduced into this whole other world where he lost his humanity and became a greedy wolf who wanted nothing but money, drugs and sex.Scorsese over the years has received a lot of stick from a section of audiences and critics for using very objectionable, unlikeable people as his protagonists. Although he enjoys exploring the worlds of these people and almost makes it fun to watch them live their lives doing questionable things, but he never shows people escaping the consequences of their actions. His films have a moral fibre attached to them that can be seen by going beneath the violence on the surface. I thought Belfort's fate was very similar to the fate of Jake LaMotta in 'Raging Bull'. Belfort's perseverance and ambition makes him successful and very rich, but his inability to control this ambition and his inability to control his multiple addictions leads to him losing all that he had and everything falls apart. Scorsese also makes a damning indictment of the US justice system by showing how you have a chance to get away with anything as long as your pockets are full.The Wolf of Wall Street looks like a typically characteristic Martin Scorsese film. His unique style is all over the film- the tracking shots, the fast movement of the camera and the voice-over by DiCaprio. The film also has the characteristic fast editing by the regular Scorsese collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker. The film is 3 hours long, but it feels much shorter due to the energy of the script. But having said that, I don't think the script is perfect like Goodfellas. There a few scenes here and there which could have been better written and some scenes could have been shorter.Leonardo DiCaprio has never been funnier. He uses a lot of physical comedy in this role when he needs to, but also efficiently portrays the more sombre emotions. The speeches that he gives in the office meetings are absolutely mesmerising. He uses the microphone in those scenes like a rockstar and exudes limitless energy and charisma. Jonah Hill brilliantly plays an odd but fascinating character who becomes a partner in crime for Belfort. Margot Robbie also deserves praise for her performance. The Wolf of Wall Street is the kind of film that we have seen Martin Scorsese make before. He has explored these themes of greed and indiscipline and how it can destroy someone, but I'd much rather watch Scorsese repeating himself than another one of those pointless superhero films or those clich√©d Hollywood romantic comedies.",9,0,4,13 May 2015
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," A reasonably satisfying conclusion to the Middle Earth saga !!!
","I personally love the original Lord of the Rings trilogy by Peter Jackson, but only as commercial blockbusters. I never viewed them as anything deep or anything which demands too much analysis. However from a technological and visual standpoint, the original trilogy was almost revolutionary. They were epic, visually exhilarating thrill rides. But I do think Jackson should have left Middle Earth after the Return of the King. There was no need to go back to that world and make prequels by breaking one book into 3 movies. I didn't like the first 2 movies of the Hobbit trilogy that much. They were mediocre summer popcorn films with too much melodrama and shiny CGI and green screen. This 3rd and last film, although not being anywhere near as good as the films in the original trilogy, is certainly better than its predecessors.This film opens with an absolutely mesmerising action set piece which is visually spectacular. From then on it has its ups and downs. The battle scenes and action scenes are very well directed, but the non-action scenes leave you extremely underwhelmed. There are attempts made by Jackson to make extremely dramatic scenes and also to continue a love triangle which started in the 2nd film, but they all look and feel cheesy and not at all convincing. So without a doubt, the fighting scenes are the ones that make this film.The acting is okay, nothing special or remarkable. To be honest, a film like this is more about the spectacular visuals and action, and less about acting skills. Most of the characters are black and white. There is no grey area. Except a few, every other character is just there to say a few lines and start fighting.This new trilogy uses a lot of CGI and green screens. One of the most important aspects why I liked the original trilogy was the fact that the orcs in the original films were real people wearing costumes. That's not the case here which negatively affects the convincing factor as far as I am concerned. So all in all, this last film of the trilogy is flawed. But I will be lying if I say I didn't have fun with it. This is a very watchable summer popcorn flick with great fight scenes, visuals and fantastic action. Just don't expect anything more in terms of character depth and narrative layers, and you will find yourself satisfied.",7,5,7,17 April 2015
Platoon," The Rumble in the Jungle
","I know many will probably disagree with me, but personally I consider Platoon to be the definitive Vietnam War movie, and I say that after taking into account Apocalypse Now. Although Apocalypse Now had a number of moments of brilliance, but on the whole I think it suffers due to a disjointed script. Platoon on the other hand is intense right from the get-go. Like many of the other films dealing with the Vietnam war,in this one too,the dark, gloomy and unrelenting jungles of Vietnam serve as a separate character in itself. The soldiers find themselves trapped in the hell that we call war. Oliver Stone executes a detailed analysis of why soldiers tend to lose their sanity and their minds in the torturous conditions. There are a number of soldiers in the film who commit heinous acts and behave hideously, but considering the circumstances, it is understandable as in a hellish environment, it is not strange if people lose their humane qualities.For me Lt. Wolfe represents the leaders and the politicians who are supposed to lead and serve ordinary people, but they have no idea what they are doing and innocents lose their lives due to their incompetence and lack of vision. Barnes and Elias represent the two schools of thought in society that generally clash at the time of war and Chris is caught in the middle who is uncertain about whom to follow.The direction is brilliant, the cinematography is great, the scores are hauntingly beautiful,the action scenes look as realistic as possible. I think the only negative aspect for the film is that Charlie Sheen is a bit weak and unconvincing in some of the scenes.This film brilliantly gives you a bird's eye view of the terrible experiences that soldiers had to face during the war. I felt psychologically drained just by watching this, I can't even begin to imagine how it affected the real soldiers.",8,2,3,2 September 2014
Wonder Woman," First genuinely solid film in the DCEU !!!
","Let me state the things that I liked first:1. Although the film uses tropes and conventions that come with the territory of superhero films, it still manages to make them feel fresh, funny and enjoyable especially because much of the film involves Diana becoming accustomed and familiar with the world of human beings which is highly different to her world which belongs to Amazonian Gods. The fish out of water element of the narrative helps in downplaying the standards tropes and freshening them up.2. The film has a very refreshing humanistic soul. Just like the protagonist, the film exudes an innocent sense of optimism and belief that is genuinely moving.3. One has to admire what it stands for and what it will do in terms of inspiring countless young girls(and boys) and stand as an example to show that a female led big budget superhero film won't always be an 'Elektra' or a 'Catwoman'.4. The DC cinematic universe, as is clear by now, will continue to deal with stuff like gods, myths, legends, etc. But thankfully unlike 'Batman v Superman' where there was a constant attempt to make a silly, convoluted fight between two gorillas wearing circus costumes seem Biblical, profound and 'important' with Lex Luthor constantly spouting pretentious, pseudo-intellectual gibberish revolving around theology, 'Wonder Woman' at least decides to have fun with this stuff by subverting these elements for the most part.5. Director Patty Jenkins clearly has an eye for visuals that have a flair to them. There are so many shots and sequences in the film that are rich with energy and personality. She makes use of Gal Gadot's physicality to give us a superhero who genuinely looks distinctive and enigmatic. The No Man's Land sequence is a great example of bravura filmmaking.6. Gal Gadot isn't giving the deepest, most complicated performance ever, but Jenkins plays to Gadot's strengths and managed to make her look as good as possible and the very aspect of the Amazonians being somewhat literal organisms ends up making Gal Gadot's stiffness in many scenes along with her somewhat one dimensional line delivery seem understandable and maybe even warranted. Chris Pine is really good and his chemistry with Gal Gadot is one of the strongest things in the film.Now let's talk about the things that I didn't like: 1. The CGI isn't very good or convincing in many scenes. There are extended sequences where the green screens become easily discernible from a visual standpoint.2. Patty Jenkins unfortunately resorts to the Zack Snyder school of slow motion abuse constantly during the action scenes. I have always felt that overusing slow motion during combat sequences only lessens the impact and appeal of these scenes.3. The reveal when it comes to the real villain can be seen coming from a distance. It just lacks the impact and surprise that it aspires to achieve.4. The majority of the final act disappointingly reverts back to a live-action video game spectacle just like 'Man of Steel' did in its final act. This prolonged badly choreographed CGI fest which the film ends with somewhat betrays all the good work that preceded it.'Wonder Woman' is flawed, but it's still a good, inspirational and enjoyable film with a good heart. I like the fact that it did unexpectedly well at the box-office because of everything that it stands for. It's not the greatest film you'll ever see, but compared to the previous outings in the DCEU like the disappointing 'Man of Steel', the pretentious and bloated 'Batman v Superman' and the laughable mess 'Suicide Squad', 'Wonder Woman' feels like a much needed breath of fresh air.",7,2,11,7 November 2017
Paths of Glory," War, what is it good for?
","Adapted from Humphrey Cobb's novel of the same name, 'Paths of Glory' is generally regarded as Stanley Kubrick's first masterpiece. Kubrick's fascination with war is apparent if one explores his filmography. It is an issue that he tackled on multiple occasions throughout his filmmaking career. 'Paths of Glory' has to regarded as a very bold piece of work considering the uncompromising way in which the film critiques the concept of patriotism and the military as an institution which was a taboo concept during the 1950s.As I mentioned above, the screenplay co-written by Kubrick, Calder Willingham and Jim Thompson is uncompromising in its approach. Kubrick doesn't indulge in any form of subtlety. The characters are pretty much laid out in black & white. We instantly know who the good guys and who the bad guys are. He gives the antagonists some motivation for their actions, but never allows the viewer to have any sort of sympathy for them. As a matter of fact, 'Paths of Glory' plays out in a very similar fashion to the pro-war propaganda films made during WW2 in the way that it offers the viewer a clear distinction between the good and the bad, but while those films used this technique to champion patriotism and nationalism, 'Paths of Glory' does the opposite. Not just patriotism, Kubrick's film is an indictment on the inherent corruption in the institutional system of the military. Kubrick underlines Humphrey Cobb's opinions in his film through cynicism and a touch of dark comedy. Very interestingly the Germans are never seen in the entire film. The enemy here is war and the dehumanisation of living soldiers which is an inherent aspect of it.'Paths of Glory' is masterfully directed. One can easily see Kubrick's presence in every shot of the film. He uses the characteristic tracking shot on numerous occasions. The sideways tracking shot of the soldiers marching ahead towards the German wire acts as a beautiful juxtaposition to the tracking shot in the bourgeois-esque scene in the dance hall where the camera follows Major General Georges Broulard walking in the background with the couples dancing in the foreground. Kubrick also juxtaposes the huge, opulent and aristocratic rooms in the army headquarters where the superior officers are stationed with the dirty and claustrophobic atmosphere in the trenches where the soldiers are stationed. Another thing that I noticed in the film was Kubrick's meticulous use of blocking. The actors move in very specific ways to beautifully depict the mental state of the characters. At times the blocking almost becomes a dance between the characters in the way Kubrick shoots them. Kubrick also uses the zooms quite extensively. Another important thing to mention will be the lighting. The cinematographer Georg Krause and Kubrick use shadows and contrast between the light and the darkness in the scenes beautifully. The shadows are artistically used to convey themes and moods in some scenes.Colonel Dax is one of the very few characters in the whole of Kubrick's filmography who can be called a true 'hero'. He is idealistic, he is a man of convictions, and he stands by his troops. Kirk Douglas brings a sense of gravitas and likable charm to the character. He is understated when he needs to be understated, but also explodes when he needs to do the same. The presence of Kirk Douglas in this cynical film actually reminds me of another film which is Billy Wilder's 'Ace in the Hole' which is also a very cynical film and has another fantastic performance from Douglas, although the characters that he plays in both the films are completely different. I will give a mention to George Macready, Adolphe Menjou and Timothy Carey too for their solid performances.Although 'Paths of Glory' is a cynical film, however it ends in the most poetic way. The final scene is heartbreaking and will make anyone melt with the humanity on show. It reminded me of 'Rashomon' where Kurosawa gives the viewer some hope in humanity after a whole film exploring the selfishness and narcissism of human beings. Actually Kubrick didn't want to include the final scene but was forced into doing it by Kirk Douglas. I have to say that last scene infinitely benefits the film. 'Paths of Glory' is truly great.",9,1,4,25 June 2016
Raging Bull," That was a bird, it's dead now !!!!
","There has been a consistent complaint against Martin Scorsese regarding the fact that the protagonists in most of his films are horrible people and Scorsese makes us watch these horrible people do horrible things and so it is very difficult to find anything likable about them. While I agree that many of Scorsese's protagonists are questionable individuals, but Scorsese doesn't just use them and make them do reprehensible acts on screen just for the shock factor. He has always attempted to deeply study these characters. He explores the environment surrounding his characters and in a way he seeks to find the source and the reasons behind the behaviours and natures of his characters. His protagonists aren't always likable, but they are pretty much always interesting and multi-layered.Raging Bull starring Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci and Cathy Moriarty is a biopic based on the life of famed boxing legend Jake Lamotta. The main character is certainly not an individual that you would like to spend too much time with. He is a misogynist, he is massively insecure, he is violent and regularly assaults his wife throughout the film. The boxing ring and the fights are used as a dramatic theme to show and reveal what Lamotta is thinking and what he is going through emotionally. The boxing ring also acts as a means for Jake to legally vent his frustration and all his accumulated anger. Jake Lamotta, in the film at least, is the result of the environment that he grew up in. It is hinted from time to time that maybe he had to spend his childhood in the midst of extensive poverty, which probably has made him as hard and as abrasive as he is shown to be. He has always aimed for the stars and wanted to achieve his goals without anyone else's help. This is a reason why he always refrains from taking the assistance of the mafia, just to glorify his independence. He views everything as a goal or a trophy. The house that he has bought for his father is a trophy to him and a symbol of self assurance that he is a big shot. His car is a trophy which he uses to woo his then would be wife Vickie. But this uncontrolled materialistic mindset gives birth to a massive sense of misogyny. When he meets his future wife Vickie, he only sees her superficial features like her figure, her legs, her cheekbones, etc. So in a way he sees her only as a human trophy and like everything he has achieved before, he makes it his mission to win her. But once he gets her, he never makes an effort to get close to her emotionally. Another thing that is so apparent about the character of Lamotta is his insecurity. After his marriage, this insecurity of his constantly makes him suspicious about his wife's supposed infidelity which slowly drives him mad. These insecurities lead to volcanic eruptions of rage throughout the film, and the ironic thing about it is that the rage that initially made him a world renowned boxer in the ring also destroys his personal life. The eccentric and violent life he leads ultimately also makes it difficult for him to maintain his performances in the boxing ring.Apart from Jake Lamotta and Vickie, another brilliantly interesting character is that of Joey played by Joe Pesci. His back and forth dialogue with De Niro is absolutely fascinating. The two brothers clearly need each other and really love each other, but the underlying anger between the two brothers is also apparent.The direction by Martin Scorsese is another character in the film effectively. He makes us completely engaged in the plight of this character. The direction is so intense, that you can't help but feel drained out. You feel the punches, you feel the knockouts and you can't help but feel connected with Lamotta even if you hate him. The fight scenes are some of the most intense scenes I have ever seen. The cinematography is awe inspiring. The film is in black and white and it looks beautiful. I think Scorsese made the film in black and white as a means to recapture the essence of the films in the 1940s and 1950s which are the decades portrayed in the movie.Last but by no means least,I have to talk about the editing. Scorsese's long time collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker edits this film with a passion. The editing during the boxing scenes is just awe- inspiring. The zoom-ins, the slow motions, the tracking shots are all perfect.As soon as the opening credits come on the screen with Lamotta jumping around and practicing his punches in the background in slow motion, I knew this was going to be a masterpiece. Interestingly while we look at Lamotta in slow motion in the opening credits sequence, throughout the film Scorsese shows us many things in slow motion from Lamotta's point of view which reveal what his mind is preoccupied with at that precise moment which range from lust, jealousy and rage.Raging Bull is a masterpiece made by an auteur in his signature intense style. Jake Lamotta is not your regular hero. He is flawed and imperfect. But Scorsese's rich character study makes him iconic due to his imperfections in the movie and the film ends with a monologue sequence that is absolutely heartbreaking.",10,4,7,17 April 2015
Straight Outta Compton," The Boys from the Hood !!!
","'Straight Outta Compton' directed by F. Gary Gray commences with police radio conversations about possible criminal activity happening on the spot which gets overlapped by reporters talking about the increased potency of the gangs in L.A. and the associated danger to society that comes along with that. So right from the get go, even before the arrival of any visuals, the director establishes the rough and chaotic surroundings that surround the characters in the film. 'Straight Outta Compton' portrays the rise and fall of the gangsta rap group N.W.A. and explores the band members, their natures, their motivations and also pays homage to their talent.Although the film is basically about the group N.W.A., but the screenplay written by Jonathan Herman and Andrea Berloff which is obviously based on real events has a very potent social poignancy to it that not only portrays America and L.A. during the late 80s and early 90s, but it also lays down the unfortunate relevance of the storyline and themes explored in the film with current times. We start off with the young men who before they became N.W.A. We see them living their ordinary lives in the poverty-ridden hoods of L.A. We can feel the discontentment with their lives in their eyes and can also feel their anger about the somewhat blatant racism in society which on many occasions gets perpetuated by cops, the upholders of the law. But they use this anger and oppression to fuel their talent through lyrics in their songs. But apart from the racism and the social inequality, 'Straight Outta Compton' also deals with the theme of what it means to be a celebrity. After the boys achieve success through their talent, we see them standing at the proverbial crossroads where they have to choose between continuing to work hard and use their talent, or allow the business side of their careers to overwhelm their art and reap the rewards of their success and drown themselves in money, random sex and parties.The film is directed really well for the most part by F. Gary Gray. The pacing is good. The cinematography is also brilliant. The film starts out in the late 80s and then progresses till the mid 90s and we do get that period feel to it. The editing is also great specially in the concert scenes which are directed and edited with a passion and the viewer feels like he/she is in the audience.The acting is also very solid. Although the film follows the whole group itself, but the main focus is on Eazy-E, Ice Cube and Dr. Dre. The actors playing these characters are Jason Mitchell, O'Shea Jackson Jr.(Ice Cube's own son) and Corey Hawkins respectively. Although the film has been accused of ignoring some elements of the real lives of the characters, but as far as I am concerned Gary Gray never completely makes angelic and flawless figures out of these characters which ends up helping the actors to show their range. We see the darker and somewhat objectionable elements of these characters which allows the actors to venture into grey areas. Paul Giamatti also comes up with a very good supporting performance.The film still isn't perfect. One reason for it is the fact that although the screenplay is based on real life events, but I still think the story gets a bit predictable from the midway point onwards. The storyline is very standard depicting the rise of a group of artists and then their downfall through in-fighting and the obscene excesses of wealth. These transitions could have been presented by Gray in a better way without some of the mainstream elements. There are also some guest appearance of real-life artists which felt a bit rushed and underdeveloped and looked a bit gimmicky.I am not a rap/hip-hop fan. I have always been a classic rock fanatic. I have admired the poetry and depth of the lyrics that have been written by a number of rap artists, but never really have I gravitated towards hip-hop as a music genre. So if you can make a film which is primarily based on a hip-hop group and make me like it so much, you have clearly made a brilliant film. The brilliance for the film lies in its technical elements coupled with the substantial themes that are explored that range from individualistic to a broader social level. I don't think it's perfect, but it still is a significant biopic of talented musicians.",8,3,28,9 February 2016
The Silence of the Lambs," An iconic thriller !!!
","Directed by Jonathan Demme and written by Ted Tally, 'The Silence of the Lambs' is based on the novel of the same name by Thomas Harris. One of the first themes that one can notice while watching the film is the element of feminism. This film has feminism and feminist ideals written all over it. What makes this work is that Demme in collaboration with Tally conveys these feminist ideas through visual filmmaking and frame compositions instead of blatant verbal delivery. The opening of the film itself is an example of this. This opening credits sequence which apparently was something Jodie Foster came up with starts with the image of barren, dry, leafless trees in a deserted foggy forest. Then Clarice appears out of this fog and we follow her as she runs and overcomes one obstacle after another on her own. This is visual storytelling at its best. The foggy, deserted, barren forest is what society can sometimes look like from a female perspective. Then we see this woman appear and face and overcome hurdles and obstacles alone and showcase her capabilities. Another great frame is that of Clarice getting dwarfed in the elevator by the big burly men standing alongside her. Clarice Sterling is an iconic female hero, but not in the clich√©d sense of the word. She is strong, intelligent and idealistic. But she is still given the chance to have a sense of fear and be vulnerable which actually makes her real and very inspirational.Another theme that I noticed in the film is the feeling of being trapped and the desire of breaking out. This theme actually binds the three characters Clarice, Hannibal and Buffalo Bill together. Clarice feels trapped in an environment which is predominantly numbered by men. But her way of overcoming this feeling is to work hard and make herself someone that the others can't take lightly. Buffalo Bill had been a victim of abuse in his past life and this had led him to hate everything about himself including his body which leads him to believe he is transsexual. So he feels trapped in his male body and wants to become a woman. This theme also applies to Hannibal Lecter, but in a much more literal sense. He is literally trapped in prisons and cages and he wants to break free. There are two transformations or desired transformations juxtaposed in the narrative of the film. The first desired transformation is Clarice's. We can see in her a determination to transform herself from the sweet, innocent girl seen in the flashback scenes to a hardened strong FBI officer. But she doesn't lose her femininity while trying to transform. Buffalo Bill on the other wants to completely lose his masculinity by using a female armour. The irony is that Bill wants to become a woman even though he treats women as objects and considers them to be fragile, weak and loves to exert his power on them.The film is brilliantly directed. Jonathan Demme uses a lot of filmmaking techniques. There are a number of tracking shots, POV shots and close-ups in the film. Demme manages to keep the film flowing and very tightly paced. But I think the best directorial decision that Demme makes here is the artistic use of close-ups. Time and again in other films, directors have used POV shots of men and especially criminals while they size up their female prey in the creepiest sense like we have seen in Michael Powell's masterpiece 'Peeping Tom'. Demme reverses that by showing us the male gaze from the woman's perspective. The men who talk to Clarice talk straight into the camera and we see what Clarice sees in their eyes. Apart from this theme, the close- ups also help the viewers in assessing the nature of these characters. Cheekily Demme reverses it again in the final set-piece and shows us Buffalo Bill's POV while he watches Clarice struggle in the dark. I would also like to mention Howard Shore's music which I thought also helped maintain the tempo of the film.The acting is pretty spectacular. Jodie Foster just through her facial expressions lets us in on what she is thinking. She acts a lot with her eyes and her face. She gives a humanity to Clarice's character as well as making her strong and determined. Anthony Hopkins' portrayal of Hannibal Lecter has become legendary. His portrayal is not realistic. He is over-the-top and very theatrical in almost a Shakespearean way. Some critics have criticised his portrayal for this very reason. But I think in the context of the film that he is in, a sedate, understated performance wouldn't have worked. The film doesn't restrict itself fully to the boundaries of realism, so some theatricality from Hopkins I feel benefited it and Hopkins is great with his intimidating eyes and distinctive vocal style of speaking. He blends disturbing psychotic antics with refined and classy gestures to make the character of Hannibal Lecter immensely complicated and deranged. The conversational scenes between Hannibal and Clarice are the ones that make the film what it is. During these scenes we see Hannibal give us subtle hints of possible abuse in his past which is why he connects with Clarice who also had to face some childhood trauma. The screenplay tactfully makes use of these conversation scenes to flesh out the character of Clarice by using Hannibal's interest in her as a psychiatrist. Ted Levine is also fantastic as Buffalo Bill. His performance gets undermentioned a lot, but he deserves a lot of credit for giving a truly disturbing performance.'The Silence of the Lambs' is a near masterpiece. It is not fully realistic, but it brilliantly directed, acted and written. Beneath the disturbing exterior, the filmmaker is working on a number of levels and the introspective viewer will be able to understand how multi- layered the film genuinely is.",9,2,3,14 June 2016
Win Win," A small, understated, heartwarming film !!!
","'Win Win' is the quintessential American Indie film. It has brilliant acting, believable characters and relateable themes, but unfortunately it isn't flashy enough to get the attention of either the box office or the Academy. But it did get a lot of critical acclaim. The story exposes us to Mike Flaherty played by Paul Giamatti a small time lawyer and his family and friends. He is a lawyer and also coaches a school wrestling team. Due to certain interesting events, Mike comes across a teenage boy named Kyle who is the grandson of Leo, one of Mike's clients. Kyle turns out to be a wrestler which ends up being a blessing for Mike's wrestling team. Kyle's introduction in Mike's life changes both of them and they realise a few things about themselves and decide to make some changes in their lives.Mike and Kyle's relationship is symbiotic and mutually beneficial in nature. Mike clearly sees a lot of himself in Kyle and ends up learning a lot about himself and what he needs to do to sort his life out and how to be 'in control'. They both end up making significant life decisions after coming into contact with each other. Now a film like that where characters start to change each other for the better and start learning things can be cheesy and heavy-handed, but this one remained true and believable due to the witty writing and brilliant acting. Both these characters start a new life at the end of the movie by changing themselves and letting go of their obstinacy and their egos. The film ends on a very sweet and poignant note and gives us an hint that Mike has decided to take control of his life instead of wallowing in self pity and allowing life to get the better of him.The acting in the film is top class all across the board. Paul Giamatti is a ridiculously talented actor. He is very versatile. You will find him in big budget films and then you will find him in these small indie films. His best performances are in these character driven films with him playing very average guys. His character in the film does a few questionable things, but due to Giamatti's likability and the gentle and humanistic way in which the script treats the character, the viewer will understand the circumstances that forced him to do what he did. Amy Ryan as Jackie, Mike's wife is also great. She brings a lot of heart and believability to a character which could have been easily reduced to a clich√©d one. She like Giamatti is also very versatile. I have seen her before in 'Gone Baby Gone' and 'Birdman' and she is brilliant in those films too, but not many talk about her too much. Alex Shaffer as Kyle is also very solid. He might come across a bit one-note, but I think that is exactly what the character required. A brash, soft- spoken, introverted boy will be just like the way he portrayed Kyle. But having said that, there are some soft vulnerable moments, where Alex beautifully emotes in a nuanced way and it works. Bobby Cannavale, Jeffrey Tambor, Melanie Lynskey and Burt Young all have minor roles, but they all perform with merit.This is the perfect example of a film where the importance is wholeheartedly given to the substance instead of the style. There is nothing remarkable going on with the way the film is shot. It's just Thomas McCarthy letting his story and screenplay flow organically without any extravagance. His characters are well rounded and realistic. They have merits and flaws and everything that make up a three dimensional human being. The subtexts and themes are dealt with in a subtle way without any preachy stuff. It's a film that blends American cinematic elements with the classic Italian neo- realism which is attempted by many of the new age American indie films. The only flaw is that Kyle, the boy that Mike meets accidentally, conveniently turns out to be a brilliant wrestler which helps out Mike with his team. This co-incidence that you will have to accept does initially make the film look a bit clich√©d and predictable, but once you accept it, the film progresses in a fluid manner and it is not without some subtle and unpredictable twists.'Win Win' is a small, understated film about average people with real problems. The film is humanistic, funny, optimistic and has a great feel- good air about it. Big recommendation.",8,2,3,4 September 2015
Blade Runner," A definitive work of art in the genre of Science Fiction !!!
","This review is for the 'Final Cut' version of 'Blade Runner'.Science Fiction can never be just about cool gadgets, big spaceships, flying cars, laser swords, weird creatures, etc. Science Fiction works the best when it deals with profound issues and themes that are relevant in the current world and society. Science Fiction should be about analysing theories and philosophies, maybe in a futuristic or other-worldly environment, and in my opinion, 'Blade Runner' is second to none in epitomising every aspect of deep Science Fiction that I have mentioned.The film is loosely based on a novel written by Philip K. Dick named 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?'. The screenplay was written by Hampton Fancher and David Peoples, of course in collaboration with the master filmmaker Ridley Scott who directed this film. It is set in the Los Angeles of 2019. This dystopian,futuristic L.A. is almost disturbingly dark, bleak, overpopulated and there is distinct contrast between the world of the haves and the world of the have- nots. The rich upper class reside in giant skyscrapers, while the lower to the lower-middle class live in dirty living conditions in the rumbling, overpopulated streets. We are told that Replicants were robots created by human beings. The Nexus 6 model of Replicants look like humans and are stronger and equally intelligent as the scientists who created them. But the only thing that they are supposed to look is emotion and empathy for others. These Replicants were used for slave labor, mainly to acquire Off-world territories for expansion. But the Replicants revolted and the they were subsequently deemed illegal and officers by the name of Blade Runners were employed to not execute, but 'retire' them.'Blade Runner' is one of the most thematically deep films I have ever seen. There are a whole array of ideas that are explored in the film. I think the primary theme running through the film is the quest for your own identity. Most of us are assigned this identity by society and we are supposed to look, act and talk in a manner which will be deemed appropriate for our identity. But in reality we spend our entire lives searching for our true identity as a person to give our lives a meaning. In a very similar way, in the world of Blade Runner, Replicants who were created by humans are rejected and deemed illegal when they revolt and demand human treatment instead of slave treatment as in the eyes of society, they are not humans. So, there is also clearly an element of equality or the lack of it which is explored in the script along with the existence of discrimination based on someone's identity in the society as a whole. The film deals with existential issues about what it means to be human. The Replicants are supposed to be devoid of emotions, which is the one thing that sets them apart from human beings, but ironically we see human beings show very little empathy during the film while the Replicants display genuine love and care for each other. The film can also be seen from a standpoint of religion. The relationship between the Replicants and their human creators can be seen as an allegory for the relationship between Man and God. Some people have certain expectations from God, the creator and when these expectations don't get met, they gradually stray away from God and abandon him/her. Death plays a huge part to underline the allegorical element. The production design is absolutely fantastic. Ridley Scott along with his collaborators gives us a living, breathing, bustling version of Scott's almost noir-ish vision of futuristic world. The attention to detail is so convincing that the viewer will feel like a part of the world depicted in the film. Ridley Scott's direction makes the world and the characters completely believable and his style always prevents 'Blade Runner' from becoming a commercial action film. The relationship between Deckard the Blade Runner played by Harrison Ford and the city reminded me of Travis Bickle's relationship with the city of New York. The New York in 'Taxi Driver' and the futuristic L.A. in 'Blade Runner' are both dark, dirty and dangerous, but still, they have a strange seductive beauty about them. Deckard, like Bickle wanders around the streets (as a Blade Runner trying to catch Replicants) and then wallows in his solitude and loneliness in the confines of his home. This is one of Harrison Ford's best performances. I think so because Deckard is a far more complex character than the characters which are more famous like Han Solo or Indiana Jones. This is because Deckard is not a stereotypical handsome, bad-ass who cracks witty one-liners and exudes machismo. This man is someone who is struggling with his identity and his loneliness and in a way the whole film revolves around this character's arc. The story moves ahead with Deckard's self realisations and changes in his opinions and Ford comes up with an understated and nuanced performance. Rutger Hauer's performance as the Replicant Roy Batty is just amazing. Instead of being a standard villain, the brilliant writing allows Roy to be more than a villain, as his motivations and opinions are very understandable and relateable. Hauer's perfect gestures and line delivery makes his character layered and worthy of empathy. Sean Young as Rachael also is great. Her performance is controlled and she beautifully adjusts her acting with the gradual psychological changes that her character undergoes. 'Blade Runner' is an existential masterpiece set in a dystopian future which never backs away from tackling very profound themes and issues. The characters are all real and the world instead of being comic bookish, is very symbolic and allegorical. Blade Runner is also one of the most influential films ever and it is deemed to be one of the few works of art which pioneered the birth of the genre of Cyberpunk. Every film lover should watch this film.",10,3,8,7 August 2015
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Bringing back Star Wars !!!
","There is a moment towards the middle of 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' when Han Solo says the following to Rey and Finn - 'It's true. The Force, the Jedi, all of it. It's all true.' - that particular line of dialogue to me completely and very clearly established and underlines the motive and the intent of JJ Abrams and Disney as a whole behind their collective approach in restarting the Star Wars Saga. Since the souring of the mood and the spirits of the diehard Star Wars fans triggered by the prequels, there had been a prolonged gap. The basic idea of 'The Force Awakens' is to end that gap by reaffirming the myths, the legends and the magic of Star Wars and reassure the fanbase with a film that symbolises the phrase - 'Star Wars(in its original form) is back !!!'
To me this idea of reaffirming the legend of 'Star Wars' has two repercussions which are very noticeable in the film. On one hand, certain elements that make the original trilogy wondrous like the joy and innocence of fantasies and adventures, Han Solo's charisma, etc. On the other hand, it also brings along with it the elements that have always prevented me from fully embracing Star Wars which are surface level storytelling, hokey and over-expressive dialogue,etc. Another problem with the film is that in trying to deliver on 'fan service', the film doubles down and flirts with the prospect of being a little over-abundant on references and moments that pay explicit homage to the original trilogy as well as overall narrative throughlines that again blatantly mirror a number of the occurrences in previous films in the series.
However what prevents the film from becoming an excuse in nostalgia porn is the characters. The new characters especially Rey and Finn were very likeable and they seem like individuals that I as a viewer would like to accompany in future adventures and spend time with. I mentioned earlier how 'Force Awakens' reaffirms the myths of Star Wars. Through Daisy Ridley's 'Rey', the film goes one step forward by hinting at powers and abilities which are unprecedented and almost incomprehensible(to Rey herself), the sources of which will probably be elaborated upon in the sequels. Harrison Ford manages to embody the swashbuckling Han Solo once again after all these years and it feels like older version of the exact same character from the original trilogy with the same charisma and sarcasm. Kylo Ren seemed interesting enough.
In an nutshell the film embodies certain elements that I have never completely been in tune with which are inherent to the concept of Star Wars itself. But having said that, with the basic energy and the exciting new characters, JJ Abrams managed to make me not only care about about this film, but also curious about what's to come next.",7,0,3,21 December 2017
Rear Window," Hitchcock's tale of voyeurism !!!!
","A photographer named L.B. Jefferies has broken his leg. With nothing to do throughout the day, he starts observing his neighbours from his window which leads him to grow more and more suspicious about one particular neighbour's behaviour which leads to extremely suspenseful consequences.Clearly Hitchcock's theme for this film is voyeurism. We all have at least once watched someone from the window secretively. The thrill of observing people who are completely unaware of our peeping has always fascinated us. This very concept of intrusion of privacy has been the primary reason behind the success of the innumerable reality shows which have become so popular nowadays. The current scenario with reality shows makes Rear Window seem profound. The neighbourhood which is being observed by Jefferies is a representation of the whole society. There is the poor couple who struggle to get by,there is the rich lady who is tortured by her loneliness, there is the young ballet dancer who is trying to make her presence felt in the social scene, the musician who is desperate to achieve success with his talent, the old bickering couple and the young newlyweds. James Stewart has a commanding presence as Jefferies. Everyone knows about Grace Kelly's looks, but what is great about this film is that Kelly is not there just to look beautiful. She is actually the one who does all the physical thrilling dirty work while Stewart remains attached to his wheel chair.The screenplay by John Michael Hayes is absolutely brilliant. The whole story gets told from the point of view of Jefferies. This is a rare suspense thriller without any chases or thrilling action sequences. The movie depends completely on atmospheric tension. Hitchcock is not called the Master of Suspense for nothing. He shows how minimalistic filmmaking can also generate spine chilling moments of suspense. The film is grounded in realism. Although at first the other characters disapprove of Jefferies' obsession with keeping an eye on his neighbours, but gradually they also become addicted to this practice of voyeurism.Rear Window is arguably Alfred Hitchcock's best film(which is saying a lot). The movie grabs your attention immediately and never lets got of it. It is an immensely engaging watch and a genuine masterpiece.",10,2,4,4 December 2014
What We Do in the Shadows," Rock n' Roll Mockumentary with Vampires !!!!
","This mockumentary has got Spinal Tap written all over it and in a good way. The film shows us the lifestyle of a few vampires who share a flat and it shows us how they lead their nocturnal lives and how they survive. The characters are all very sweet and likable, even though kill and drink human blood to survive. The film and the directors love these characters and that love permeates through the film in each scene. The vampires come off as naive, adorable and sometimes arrogant (like rockstars) individuals who struggle to cope with changing times of the dynamic human society. The film also has enough blood and gore for the fans who like their vampire films to be gruesome.The acting from all parties involved is brilliant. The direction and screenplay is good. The film has the typical dry, quirky British humour (although it is from New Zealand) that I like and it is a thousand times better than most loud,raunchy American comedies that get released nowadays. The storyline is simple, but the brilliance of the writing and the screenplay keeps the viewer engaged throughout the film.The film might not go up to 11, but it is still 'bloody' great (the pun was intended).",9,0,2,3 March 2015
Jackie Brown," Tarantino not being Tarantino !!!!
","This undeniably has a look and feel that is different from all other Tarantino films. He avoids the flashiness and and his signature over the top bravura to present us with a very mature, low key film that expertly engages us and still has all the entertainment value that all his other films boast of. Although this is again a story that deals with crime and criminal activities, but there is surprisingly very little violence and blood shed throughout the film. The script is tight with very subtle scenes involving very provocative dialogues. Characters look much more believable and realistic than Tarantino's other films and the acting is top class. Pam Grier and Robert Forster deserve a special mention. The screenplay like Pulp Fiction is at times non linear and very intricate. All the different characters play significant roles leading up to a satisfying climax.I really was impressed by this film and I now know how mature and versatile Tarantino can be when he wants to. For me, this is Tarantino's 3rd best film after Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction.",9,1,1,4 September 2014
Her," Love in the Time of Technology !!!
","'Her' is primarily a film that has to be categorised as romantic drama which has elements of science-fiction and it does have something to say about the relationship between human beings and technology. It is based on an original screenplay written by Spike Jonze who also directs it. It stars Joaquin Phoenix, Amy Adams, Rooney Mara, Chris Pratt and the voice of Scarlett Johansson. The story consists of a protagonist named Theodore(Phoenix). Theodore is trying very hard to cope with his divorce. He has a job which is to write the messages in the greeting cards for his clients. His life's irony is that he eloquently expresses the feelings and emotions of his clients in his cards, but he can't do the same with his own emotions while facing real people in his life due to his fears and lack of confidence after his divorce. But he installs an operating system with Artificial Intelligence and gradually becomes emotionally attached to it.In the above paragraph, I have mentioned that this film can be categorised as a romantic drama, as well as sci-fi, because Jonze seamlessly blends the themes to make a film that is introspective as well as deeply charming and affectionate. It can be seen as just a romance/drama film once you ignore the fact that Samantha voiced by Johansson is an OS and assume that she is just a woman whose body remains invisible in the film. Then it becomes a compassionate film about a very introverted man who is struggling to get over the divorce with his ex-wife. His divorce has left him scarred and he fears that entering into a relationship with another woman might also lead to an eventual heartbreak . So he avoids any kind of commitment, so that he doesn't get hurt again. But then he meets this 'person' Samantha and she understands him and lets him conquer his fears and they help each other evolve and their relationship flourishes. Although they eventually go their separate ways, the split is amicable and Theodore and Samantha both make each other better individuals before letting go of each other.The other way to view this film will be to see it as a sci-fi film which makes a commentary on the relationship between a man and an operating system. The film is based in the not so distant future and this isn't too far-fetched. Theodore gets his heart broken when his marriage falls apart and that experience fills him up with a lot of apprehension regarding relationships and he starts avoiding commitments. His relationship with the OS can be seen to be symbolise our relationship with technology in the 21st century. We restrict ourselves to this virtual world of the social media and technology instead of having to deal with real people and real relationships and possible pain. Technology gives us self esteem boosts like getting views on our youtube videos or getting likes on Facebook status updates or photos,etc. But Theo in the end realises that this relationship can never be as special as sharing your life with another human being as it lacks the exclusive nature of a relationship. So he ends up giving up his fears and accepting the fact that human interaction can lead to pain, but it can also lead to incomparable joy. There are many films that try to make a social commentary about the gradual escalation in the effect technology is starting to have on our lives. But 'Her' is probably the most humanistic treatment of the subject that I have seen. Spike Jonze pays respect to the characters without judging them. Theodore is never made to look like a freak for falling in love with an OS. Jonze makes us understand him and completely relate with his reasons for doing so. 'Her' can be a great companion piece for 'Disconnect', another film about humans and technology which I loved.Joaquin Phoenix is known for playing intense and somewhat manic characters. This might be his most understated performance and he drives the film due to the charm and likability that he lends to the protagonist. The voice acting by Scarlett Johansson is also fabulous. She made me believe in their relationship without even showing her face and that deserves admiration.The cinematography is also brilliant. Red, white and few other colours are used to convey themes and the film has a dreamy, colourful look to it. The music is complementary to the film due to its understated zaniness. 'Her' as a whole is a beautiful, charming and humane film from Spike Jonze who is known for subjects that feel 'out of the box'. It works both as a romantic drama as well as sci-fi. Hugely recommended.",9,0,3,18 September 2015
Hacksaw Ridge," A man of conviction !!!
","'Hacksaw Ridge' directed by Mel Gibson tells the true story of Desmond Doss, a conscientious objector who saved countless lives of American(and a few Japanese) soldiers at that battle of Hacksaw Ridge during WWII without firing a single shot due to his convictions.The screenplay written by Andrew Knight and Robert Schenkkan divides the narrative structure of the film into two parts. The first half is spent in giving us an understanding of the character of Desmond, his nature, his family, the environment that he grew up in, his love life, and of course his religious beliefs and ideals. The second half takes place in the battlefield. Gibson sets a very saccharine tone for the section of the film dealing with Desmond's past and family life. I think the reason for this might have been the need for the film to reflect Desmond's simplistic, innocent and immensely uncomplicated approach towards life just like 'Sunset Boulevard' gets a bit over-the-top at times to reflect the character of Norma Desmond. Although that is an understandable creative choice, I think Gibson struggles a bit to keep the tone from spilling into cheesiness at times. The dynamics between Desmond and Dorothy is initially awkward(intentionally), but becomes sweet later on. But the family scenes that we see involving his father are a bit too clich√©d. Once Desmond decides to enlist and makes his way to the army training camp, the themes of the film come into full effect. He strongly and rigidly stands by his belief and conviction to never pick up a weapon. As one would expect, this leads to complications. Just like Serpico, Desmond faces animosity and coldness from his colleagues and superiors for holding on to his beliefs when others don't share them. Although from time to time you do get the odd Christian imagery and just like Frank Serpico in Lumet's 'Serpico', Desmond here is portrayed as a bit of a Jesus figure, but I still think Mel Gibson does well to not shove the religious aspects down the viewer's throats. The religious elements are mostly incidental, the major theme of the film is the need to stay true to your own beliefs and convictions(as long as they aren't illegal/immoral). If he wants to help the troops by being a medic without picking up a gun, then he maybe should be allowed to do so without being judged(especially when he isn't judging the others for fighting either).Then the war scenes start and Mel Gibson's trademark visual flair appears through big, brutal, violent and uncompromising shots and set-pieces. But even though the scenes are stylishly executed with as much gore as you would expect from Gibon's action scenes, there is a potentially problematic aspect to staging these scenes with the kind of style and panache that Gibson does stage them with. On one hand the argument can be made that Gibson's decision to elaborately depict these scenes with the deeply horrific and hellishly violent aspects is actually an act of being authentic to the deadly truths of war and also an act of being respectful to the troops who endured and embraced these horrors for the love of their respective countries. But a counter argument can be made that these scenes are an example of a director prioritising and thereby indulging in graphic and stylishly directed violence of body horror and torture over the central theme of the film which is a man providing priceless help in the field of battle in spite of holding on to his ideals of pacifism and maybe thereby, the film ends up contradicting its central theme. This argument is backed up by the fact that although the rest of the film takes place completely from Desmond's point of view, as soon as the battle scenes start, suddenly the point of view shifts and we become a third person observer of violence in war. I can see validity in both the arguments which makes it a bit difficult to completely embrace those scenes. As soon as the point of view shifts back to Desmond and we see him carry out his heroically famous act of saving countless injured troops, the film starts working brilliantly and becomes immensely inspirational due to the bravery on show. Andrew Garfield deserves a lot of praise for his portrayal of Desmond Doss. It can be really difficult to portray someone who has a very simplistic view of the world and has a childlike innocence about him. There are scenes and lines which could have sounded very cheesy, but Garfield makes, at least, most of them look and sound sweet instead of corny. Teresa Palmer as Dorothy also adds a sense of sweetness and likability to the film. Hugo Weaving, Sam Worthington and Vince Vaughn are also good.I don't think 'Hacksaw Ridge' is a flawless film. There might be certain moments of Mel Gibson's over-indulgence in extreme violence (by moving away from Desmond Doss' POV) which to some extent defeats the purpose of the thematic content and maybe some scenes also become a bit too saccharine. But even then, the film for the most part has something nice to say about the flexibility of the definitions of bravery and masculinity. It tells a story worth telling and it made me aware of a great man who deserves to be known for his actions. Recommended.",7,0,5,18 February 2017
Princess Mononoke," Humanity and Nature !!!!
","Hayao Miyazaki is a legendary name in the genre of anime film- making. What sets his films apart from the rest is the fact that although his films may be animated which is generally considered to be a cinematic medium directed towards kids, but he makes his films profound enough for adults to enjoy too. The kids will find the vibrancy of the visuals enjoyable while the adults will get enough thematic and allegorical depth. Princess Mononoke is no different.Miyazaki deals with the age-old relationship between human beings and nature. The movie I believe is set in Japanese Civil War era. Miyazaki beautifully uses the fantasy-like storyline to promote the messages of tolerance, coexistence and unity and the denouncement of hatred. Man and nature have the right to exist together without any harm coming to either. The script does get a bit too preachy at times, but the visual subtlety and beauty of the film overwhelms the minor issues with the script. The film could have been a little shorter. The film ends beautifully with optimism and with a hope for a new beginning. I had minor reservations with the script, but nevertheless the mastery of Miyazaki's film-making is visible throughout the film and Princess Mononoke is must watch for everyone irrespective of your feelings towards the genre of anime.",8,1,2,23 May 2015
