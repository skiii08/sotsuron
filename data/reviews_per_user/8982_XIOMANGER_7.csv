Requiem for a Dream," Dark and Harrowing (SPOILERS INCLUDED!)
","Some movies are all about the mood they produce inside the viewer. These are the sort of movies that worm and cocoon their way inside the viewer's mind and make the viewer replay over and over in their mind every single sequence of the movie. These movies just don't let go of your soul. That is when you know a movie is truly great. Requiem is one of those movies.The atmosphere that requiem conveys is a dark and hopeless one. We all have our burdens in life. Things that drag us down come from both outside and within. It is especially a tragedy when the latter occurs and Requiem is the first movie I know to quite explicitly make that its chief topic and convey this tragedy in all its unrelenting pain and intensity.Basically, there are 4 main characters in the movie. A troubled youngster, his mother, his girlfriend and his friend. In one way or the other, they all want better than they have, a touch of meaning and sunshine in their lives. In one way or the other, they all end up turning to drugs, truly believing they are on a course of making their life better. An in one way or the other terrible fates befall all of them.The most tragic fate is without a doubt is that of the elderly mother. That performance was without a doubt worthy of 10 Oscars. An old lady, whose husband has long since been gone and who has nothing better to do in life than to watch infomercials and basically wait to die, receives one of those fake 'you're a winner' types of phone calls, which instills a belief in her that they will call her to be on television. There she can wear the lovely red dress that swooned the heart of the now-deceased love of her life and she can tell everyone all about her wonderful only son (who incidentally keeps stealing the TV from her so he can pawn it for drug money; she keeps buying it back). However, she is quite old and naturally with more weight than she had when she was young. The dress doesn't fit. She survives only one day on a restrictive diet. The one solution she finds are diet pills, which are prescribed by a doctor who notably avoids any eye contact with her at the check-up. These 'diet pills' turn out to be uppers. They slim her down quite all right, they also make her disoriented and prone to harrowing hallucinations. In the end she runs out of her apartment into the street completely broken and disoriented, barging into an office building and in tears demanding to know why has she not been called on television. She gets admitted to a hospital and undergoes shock therapy. As a patient the only thing she can do is dream of being on the show with her son.The other three fare no better. Initially, they are making a fortune selling drugs and all have other dreams they are now just on the verge of achieving. They don't even have much of a habit at the start. However, when a gang shootout creates a shortage, their addiction becomes apparent. The relationship between the son and his girlfriend deteriorates as finding 'the bread' takes priority. The girl eventually resorts to selling her body at drug parties, while the other two head south in search for drugs. They get arrested, while the son's hand gets badly infected from intravenous drug use and must be cut off. There are many things to like about this movie. The slow and subtle darkening of the tone. In the beginning, when things still all seem good, the tones are light and the lighting is natural. Slowly, but steadily it is replaced by artificial lighting, sounds become more confusing. The storyline is moved along by short visuals such as the sequences of blood surging, pill swallowing and eyes dilating. Fixed cameras are ingeniously used giving us a glimpse into the inner mental states of our protagonists. Film speeds up to give us an impression of someone on ecstasy while the entire atmosphere slows down and changes after the high wears off. At times the movie is quite scary. The soundtrack is of course very memorable and the tune will no doubt linger in people's minds for a long time. Lastly, the crescendo of the last 15 minutes is not for the faint of heart. Each destiny is intertwined with others in a sequence of absolute terror and destitude. Shock therapy, humiliating prison work, ultimate sexual debasement and losing one's arm are all rapidly spliced in parallel. It is the lowest point in the lives of each of these characters, the natural consequence of the entire movie. This is one of my all time favorite movies.Rating 10/10Scale:Positive opinion of a movie: 10 MASTERPIECE, 9 Excellent, 8 Good, 7 OKNeutral opinion of a movie: 6 Adequate, 5 Average, 4 MediocreNegative opinion of a movie: 3 Poor, 2 Bad, 1 HORRIBLE",10,0,2,26 October 2004
Fight Club," Movie that changed my life! All time no.1!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
","From the moment the narrator slobbers on Bob's tits I just knew there was going to be something very special about this movie. This movie quite simply embodies everything that a movie is supposed to be. A 2h roller coaster ride of thoughts and emotions. It can quite rightly be regarded as the first movie of the 21st century. To put it simply: This movie is the most intense thing I have ever seen.The idea of the movie seems simple, and if you watch the commercials it will re soundly have the appearance of a conventional film. An ordinary and, more importantly, nameless guy (who narrates the entire film) meets a non-conformist and quite insane Tyler Durden. 'Now let me tell you something about Tyler'. He does night jobs. He works as a waiter at galla dinners and pees in the soup, subsequently suing the catering companies. He works as a projector and splices short, but definitely noticeable, porno clips into children's movies. Last but definitely not least, he scrounges the dumpsters at liposuction clinics for bags of fat, makes soap out of it, and 'sells [the rich ladies] their own fat asses back for a profit'. Out of this soap, he also makes explosives.After having his house blown away for at that point undetermined reasons, the narrator turns to Tyler for a place to stay, which turns out to be one of those wrecks even poverty-stricken squatters would stay away from and in the middle of nowhere. Little by little, Tyler lures the narrator into his ways and makes him question his entire reality. By defining himself through his job and what he buys, he has lost touch with his inner self and his true emotions of loneliness and helplessness. Tyler's solution is to stop trying to control things, to hold on to things one does not need, to be perfect. Tyler's answer is to 'let the chips fly'. To do things just for the heck of it, including experiencing pain. Only when one can loose everything one does not need is one free to go after what truly matters. The entire progression of just how far one can go is evident in the movie. Tyler first cajoles the narrator into having a fight with him with the following words: 'I've never been in a fight either. There is no one watching. Come on, how much can you truly know about yourself if you've never been into a fight'. This duking out turns out to be a pleasurable experience and becomes a regular event. Before you know it, other guys join the fray and the ultimate release in the form of senselessly beating another man and in turn being beaten is institutionalized in the form of 'Fight Club', lead by Tyler and the narrator. Evidently this movie reeks of testosterone and raw, violent male energy and the movie is unapologetic in this respect to the very end. In some ways 'Fight Club' is about rediscovering ones masculinity, a force quite vilified and suppressed in recent decades. Converts to 'Fight Club' include former members of the 'Remaining Men Together', a club of testicular cancer sufferers, mostly abandoned by their wives now having children with other men, who before 'Fight Club' knew of nothing better than to cry on each others shoulders (literally) and pathetically embrace each other. Hilariously, one of the key characters and ex-members of this group, played by Meatloaf, is aptly equipped with huge titties. That 'Fight Club' transforms everyone in it is evident, especially on the narrator, who is no longer content to tolerate the cr** one routinely gets served with in wage-slaving office jobs. He ultimately blackmails his boss into giving him 'a job never to tell anyone' about the dirty dealings in the company. To seal the deal, the narrator starts 'fighting' himself and is so violently battered by the time security arrives that his boss has no chance but to comply. In any case, the number of 'Fight Club' members grows. And they all start listening to what Tyler has to say. Tyler's influence on this large band of people from all walks of life slowly grows and culminates in the so-called 'Project Mayhem'. Rather than being freed, they end up being made instruments of Tyler's will. The narrator is of course mostly kept out of the loop and must find out what is going on before its too late!And then something unexpected happens. And the REAL fun starts!Suffices to say that Fight Club packs more story and ideas than ten times what most movies do. The ideas truly resonated with me. The energy of the movie is at a fever pitch. The violence is gritty and its underlying purposelessness makes it that much more intense. Tyler's charm and charisma are awe-inspiring. Truly all the actors do a superb job.In terms of visually conveying all the ideas, Fight Club is unparalleled. Since the entire movie is narrated, we experience wild and sometimes outrageous cuts between different scenes and time frames. More so, we are treated with astounding visuals, close-ups, slow motion scenes, featuring in one case an explosion happening in slow motion. In line with the 'splicing of porno movies into children's films', many interesting 'splices' occur through out the movie itself. The effects are given a gritty 90s-00s feel. Yet they are there only to consistently prop up the story and elevate it to a new high. In short, in terms of visual innovation and effects this is probably the most innovative movie since Annie Hall. What can I say, this movie will undoubtedly be talked about for centuries to come and be the mark of a 'very strange time' in the life of humanity.10/10SCALE:positive opinion of a movie: 10 MASTERPIECE, 9 Excellent, 8 Good, 7 OKneutral opinion of a movie: 6 Adequate, 5 Fair, 4 Mediocrenegative opinion of a movie: 3 Poor, 2 Bad, 1 HORRIBLE",10,1,4,26 October 2004
Memento," I had a summary, but my memory is too fallible!
","Right when I began watching the movie, since the very moment that picture in the opening credits started disappearing and the initial kill, I wondered is this just one of those gimmick movies or will they actually follow through with this idea till the end. I say this because, without a doubt, the idea of a movie played entirely in reverse (as opposed to flashbacks or other narrative non-linear-story-telling devices) is quite bold and unconventional, at least before other movies such as Irreversible started copying Memento. That this reverse storytelling serves a purpose to actually for the most part enter the world of our character is even more worthy of compliment. Instead of knowing the past we know the future, which is of little use as the future itself has to be redefined each time we go further into the past. The fact the movie comes up with fresh ways of challenging our perceptions of the future is another plus for it. The film-noir atmosphere is another plus. Guy Pearce's acting and conveying the emotions of an eternally heartbroken and disoriented person is yet another plus. Finally, an ending which completely and profoundly reverses all expectations, not only of all preceding events (in the future) but also of what these movies are genrewise supposed to be like, quite simply settles it for me. This movie is more than worthy of a 10.Memento is another one of those superb and almost perfect movies which is a joy to watch over and over again and continually ponder not just its plot but also the philosophical and emotional issues it raises.Rating 10/10Scale:Positive opinion of a movie: 10 MASTERPIECE, 9 Excellent, 8 Good, 7 OKNeutral opinion of a movie: 6 Adequate, 5 Average, 4 MediocreNegative opinion of a movie: 3 Poor, 2 Bad, 1 HORRIBLE",10,1,3,26 October 2004
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," A complete and utter disappointment
","Sins the movie commits: pretentiousness, being boring, blatant and detrimental overuse of computer graphics, using Jar-Jar at all, using Jar-Jar for the sole purpose of heading the intergalactic council and institute a state of emergency (what the... ????????), creating the most miserable love couple in all movie history, lack of credible and interesting villains, lack of coherent story. To sum up, everywhere the movie can go wrong it does. The Yoda sword fight scene is the ONE place where the movie acquires entertainment value. There is of course the scene in the colosseum, but that is somewhat of an overkill, being that the aliens in the original Star Wars were never meant to be so nightmare inducing. The security subplot in the beginning is simply wretched. Most of the film is planet hopping and marveling for 5 minutes the computer graphics for that given planet.Anakin's character is particularly laughable. No wonder only a mother would love such a character. He is a pretentious and spoiled little scumbag. I expected SOME transformation into the evil Darth Vader from a decent person (that would have added to the movie this thing known as DEPTH!), not THIS. And his love affair with the princess is hilarious. It is hilarious to see Natalie Portman try to find plausible acting ways in which she can swoon and be moved by words which would instantly repulse any normal female. She of course fails miserably, not that the miserable lack of chemistry and the absolutely pathetic lines are all her fault, quite the contrary. And you know, if I was female, I would think twice about staying in a relationship with a guy that has just described killing innocent women and children. What a gradual transformation of Anakin into an evil Darth Vader.A stinker of magnificent proportions!Rating 2/10Scale: 10 MASTERPIECE, 9 Excellent, 8 Good, 7 OK, 6 Adequate, 5 Average, 4 Mediocre, 3 Poor, 2 Bad, 1 HORRIBLE",2,0,1,29 October 2004
Underground," One of the two movies ever that made me cry
","The scene when after all the pain and suffering the stuttering younger brother finally finds his old ape friend is the most poignant scene in all movie history. I am fully aware that that statement might be interpreted as national bias, but it isn't. What can be said about this movie that hasn't been said already? That a young upstart Balkan nation gambled away the only chance it ever had after WWI of creating a peaceful, stable, safe and prosperous state, opting instead for a 'Yugoslavia'. That cowards and opportunists always ruled the show over decent people. That these decent people were always great heroes when it came time to fight the enemies from without, but legendary cowards and naive sheep when it came time to fight the enemy within own ranks. That a bunch of criminals ruled a communist Yugoslavia for 45 years, keeping everyone in he dark as to what was actually happening in the world. That when the cat finally came out of the bag, the people in the basement proved catastrophically inept at handling the new situation and that that only leads to more pain and suffering. And all of it, the pain, the humiliation, the bitterness, comes down to, boils into, condenses itself into that one scene where the two old friends meet. And one young lad at that time lacking the luxury of living in a normal country opened his floodgates.There is so much to take in while watching the movie. It is nothing short of a complete history of a deceased nation of brotherhood and unity, all of it told in an allegorical style. All of which I have described in the previous chapter. The music and visual style of the movie is breathtaking. There is not a second of the movie that is not entertaining or engaging. Not a second that is not significant or out of place. And the movie is full of life, for whatever happens, life goes on. With every pain there is joy and vice versa.But this life is decidedly underscored by the forces of death and evil. The full extent of betrayal becomes apparent towards the end, initially being painted with naive humor. In this betrayal an entire country ad an entire people were sacrificed. The only thing that is left is memory. Memory of those one has lost during the dark years of Nazi invasion, the dark years of communism and the dark years of the recent wars. Memory of a past time, with its own rules, characters and experiences. One which humanity must never forget.

Pulp Fiction," Why can't there be a thousand movies as good as this one?
","The one thing that really makes this movie stand apart from all other movies is not the gratuitous violence, nor the philosophical issues it raises, not even the dialog. We've seen all that before in one movie or another, though perhaps not as powerfully combined as in this movie. The one thing that REALLY makes this movie stand is how much fun it is to watch it. EVERY SECOND of the movie is incredibly entertaining. Every of the several story lines is captivating, novel, unusual, and, quite simply, interesting. How can I ever watch conventional blockbusters after this movie?Some of the great precious things for me in this movie: the watch-in-rectum story, a disgruntled suburban asking his good old friend Jules who has just brought a dead body into his garage whether there was a 'dead n***er storage' sign in front of his garage, the foot massage discussion, the thought of what will happen to Zed, Wolf's knack for solving every possible problem, the Quarter Pounder discussion (by the way, its true; you CAN buy beer in movie theaters AND in Mc Donalds in Europe) and of course the initial shootout. Watching the soon-to-be-dead guy tremble in fear as Jules skillfully leads the discussion ('breaking his concentration' at times) is so much fun. There is a lot to be said also about the style of the movie. The dialog is of course legendary, and every line in the movie is infused with significance. While all characters really do seem like they are out of a comic book they all exude style. This makes their every action, as I said before, fascinating.The movie is quite violent. Even though the violence is stylized, it is depicted with scary realism and its full consequences, unlike action movie violence. When a guy's head gets blown off, we see it in all its glory, including our main heroes trying to 'pick up the pieces' for the next hour or so. This is perhaps also one of the few movies that had the audacity to show a male-on-male rape and afterward the victim, having gotten the upper hand over the assailants, seething in anger and desire to extract unimaginable revenge, despite his calmness. Unlike in action movies, everyone is scared ****less when their lives are at stake, even though a sharp line is still drawn between the main characters of the movie and 'cannon-fodder'. This is also one of the few movies the 'n' word is used so often, most of the times with just the right energy to have a hilarious effect. Quentin, in my opinion, rightly says in an interview that every time a word is given such a power, one should shout it out from the rooftops until the power goes away. Anyway, here's to Quentin remaining a prolific director for a long time in the future!By the way, if he ever decides to make a Big Kahuna franchise, he would be a millionaire.

The Godfather," Didn't get it!
","Call me crazy, call me whatever, but I simply didn't get the movie. I think I know the reason why. After seeing 1000s of rip-offs and the motives inside this movie explored to the death in countless movies since the 70s, the initial hand-kissing scene looks pretty trite. Or the making an offer you can't refuse? Puhleeze! The movie is quite slow. I know it is all about the atmosphere, but it really is nothing special. Neither does the mumbling of Marlon Brando convey any special significance to me. Yes, he is remorseful for being a powerful leader of a criminal empire and assigning this fate to his son. Boo hoo hoo. If you don't become a crook you don't have these kinds of problems. And yes, we all get it. The aggressive son is doomed to be killed in retaliation, the ineffectual son is doomed to remain in the shadows and the resourceful son is destined to take over the 'family business'. He simply kills off his adversaries without it ever being made clear how he outsmarted them or why no one ever came for him in a similar fashion. He actually turns into quite a ruthless son-of-a-... But there is something more fundamental about why the movie isn't 'doing anything' for me. The entire notion of 'honor' and 'chivalry' among criminals. It's completely fake. Now that America is mostly out of the grip of such people (not so in my own country I'm afraid, but still far from Chicago of the 20s) glorifying them is easy. The truth however is quite different. Criminals usually talk of honor, but their actions are based on much baser things. And they always have an excuse for why they ended up being crooks. Don't get suckered into believing movies like these convey any truth.
