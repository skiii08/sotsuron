The Ring," The Ring - recommendation
",Mark and Gregoryrating : 8/10 set: in the present A few years before the action of the film there was an oracle that has a strange kid. That girl killed Every person that she wants to die. On the main action of the film reporter of the famous Japanese newspaper researched for a cursed tape. All people that watched the cassette died after a week. The best part of a film was when the Sadoko comes out from TV. I think that is an original idea for a film and the plot is very good. I  recommend that film for you.,Null,1,1,24 October 2003

The Matrix Reloaded," We'd like Drew :)
","Review of Matrix Reloaded
	Matrix Reloaded was made by Wachowscy brothers, they are of Polish descent. The stars of this movie are: Neo  Michal from Poland, Trinity Kasia from Poland, Morpheus  Drew Still from England. Neo, Morpheus, Trinity, and the rest of their crew continue to battle the machines that have put the human race in the Matrix. Neo learns more about his super-heroic abilities, including the ability to see the codes of the people and things around him, and he also thinks that  he is a superman:) ( that is a stupid idea of the autors). Now, more humans are waking up out of the Matrix and attempting to live in the real world. As their numbers grow, the battle moves to Zion--the last real-world city and centre of human resistance. But in the end of the second part of the  Matrix human race loses the final fight with the machines, only Neo, Morpheus, Trinity and 2 men from their crew survive.

The Matrix," Matrix was the best film of 1999 year!
","The directors of The Matrix are Andy and Lary Wachowscy. We think, thats the Matrix was the best film of 1999 year. The STAR of this film is Keanu Reeves (Neo) Laurence Fishbourn (Morpheus), Carrie- Anne Moss (Trinity). The film is about an IMAGINARY WORLD called MATRIX. The machines reign world. Peoples are some kind of batteries. Morpheus want to destroy the machines and rescue Earth. He and his fellowship travel in the sewage by ship. The best parts of film are  FIGHTING SCENE. Matrix take the revolutions in the since- fictions film because they add the BULLET TIME and the 360 rate.Lukasz & Mateusz",Null,1,2,24 October 2003

Gladiator," Very good movie
","It's a epic story set in ancient Rome. Roman's general, Maximus (Russel Crowe) fight in the arena as a gladiator, for vengeance. His family was murdered on the order of the bad emperor, Commodus. Maximus was badly injured and sold to the gladiator's school. He didn't have any hope - he wanted to die, but first he wants to kill Commodus. It's a story about friendship, loyality, honour and love, who wins over  death. The movie's director is Ridley Scott, a famous British director (Alien, Thelma & Louise, Black Hawk Down). Fantastic good music composed by Hans Zimmer & Lisa Gerard (she's stars in the group Dead can dance). In my humble opinion - it is one of the best movies that I saw for the last five years.",Null,0,1,24 October 2003
