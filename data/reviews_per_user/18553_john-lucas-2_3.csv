The Incredible Hulk," 'Hulk Smash'
","The Hulk does indeed smash. And once he's finished smashing something, or someone, he goes ahead and smashes something else. Thats just the sort of guy he is. He's a smasher.Anyway this movie is awesome. It really really is. The cgi is absolutely brilliant, second only to Iron Man, which is also awesome. Forget about the old hulk movie, I believe they just pretended it never happened and brushed it under the carpet. But they also didn't take an hour explaining the origins of the hulk. Nope, instead they did a simple montage at the beginning that gave you all the info you needed, and filled in the gaps and it went along. much better.The story unfolds gradually throughout, but the action just keeps smacking you in the face...smash smash smash. You really have to be a kid at heart to like this movie, and I am, so I did.Also it does indeed confirm the future of the Marvel franchise, which sounds really exciting. I ain't gonna tell you what it is, but if you stayed until the end of Iron Man, after the credits, you'll know what I'm talking about.Go and watch it, you'll love it.",9,5,9,25 June 2008
Cloverfield," Fantastic
","I have read other reviews that have been quite tough on Cloverfield, I suggest you ignore them, as their main concern is on jittery camera work, which is completely irrelevant.This is one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time, and I think I've seen them all. The way in which it is shot really captures you and make you believe that that its actually real.The special effects are fantastic and the acting is very well performed.There are some bits that I would have liked in there, like some better explanations, and 'what happened after' the events that I will not mention.Overall, very good, well worth you spending cash to see it.",8,1,3,3 February 2008
Iron Man," Gold-Titanium Alloy Man...Iron Man's better
","Sweet sweet sweet...this movie was ace.I know some people who don't enjoy this movie, and in a way I can understand. Yes it is childish, and yes it is slightly over the top, but basically if you're a big childish moron, like me, you will love this flick. Simple story, good acting, and a lot of things going BOOM!! And better still, there's more to come. It appears that they're not going with the typical trilogy which we have all come used to. Like the X-men trilogy, spider man, blade, and so on. Nope, they have something far more entertaining and the new incredible hulk movie confirms this. I ain't gonna tell you what it is, I'm a geek so I know, but just sit back and hold tight and enjoy this cgi marvel classic. Oh and stay behind after the credits have finished...you'll see a familiar face.",9,1,2,25 June 2008
