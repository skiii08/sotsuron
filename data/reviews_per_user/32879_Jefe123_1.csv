It," Worst horror movie I've seen
","I'm at a loss for how this is rated 7+ on IMDB. Background - I have never seen any prior show/book related to this movie. I heard chatter about it when it came out and saw the decent rating on here, so when it showed up on Netflix I decided to give it a watch. Bottom line - this was probably the worst horror movie I've ever seen. What audience is this 'horror' movie made for... 13 year olds? Everything rapidly falls apart after the opening scene and there is NO redeeming qualities to be found afterwards. I'd say Stranger Things is more of a 'horror' movie than this is.",1,2,3,25 October 2019
