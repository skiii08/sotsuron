Vertigo," Vertigo is NOT a Hitchcock film!
","No, I am not grotesquely stupid.  I realize perfectly well that Vertigo was indeed directed by Alfred Hitchcock.  The point of the summary of my comments is to express my opinion about this fantastic film.A lot has been said about Vertigo on this page, so I will try not to repeat much of it here.  (No spoilers either!)  Many people say that Vertigo falls short of the typical suspense thriller that we have come to expect from Hitch.  And to that I say so what?  So what that the revelation of the murder comes during the middle and not the end?  Hitchcock made a different kind of film here, and I don't think it should placed alongside the body of his work.I first saw Vertigo about 7 years ago with an old girlfriend, who had the bad habit of not paying attention to films.  This particular screening, it rubbed off on me.  After watching it I had no idea what it was about, and always meant to watch it again.  I never did until AMC's recent Film Preservation Festival.  And when I saw Vertigo- paid strict attention to it from start to finish- I was blown away.My advice to people watching this film for the first time is this: if you have seen other Hitchcock films, forget about them. If you've seen Jimmy Stewart films, forget about his typical 'nice guy' character.  You will get a lot more out of the film if you do. (By the way, I love Stewart in roles like those of L.B. Jeffries and Ben McKenna.)Vertigo is perhaps the most painstakingly detailed film I have ever seen in terms of cinematography.  Each and every shot is a carefully composed painting.  Someone remarked 'Where is everyone else in San Fran?  It seems to be only Stewart and Novak in the whole city.'  To me this is an essential element for the dark, brooding mood of the film.  Because of the starkness, the lack of people in the shots, the film grabs your attention.  Even if the story had been mediocre (and it was NOT by a long shot), I would have been satisfied watching this series of cinematic compositions and breathtaking effects.  It was so refreshingly different from any other film I have ever seen, and I doubt that anything comparable has ever been made.Back to the comparison with other Hitch films for a moment.  When I think of Rebecca, Notorious, and Rear Window, for example, I think of watching a fun, suspenseful film- thoroughly enjoyed from start to finish.  You know who the bad guys are, and you know the heroes will come through in the end.  The beauty of these films is the masterful storytelling, the intricate, almost flawless plots.  Vertigo is not that kind of film.  It was almost difficult to watch, seeing the hopelessness of Stewart and Novak's characters, watching their fates unfold.  And there is plenty of suspense, even after the revelation of the murder.  It is the characters in this case that are more important.  What will happen to them after all the lies and deceptions? The ending is perhaps questionable, perhaps a little too abrupt, but it provoked a strong emotional response from me- an atypical reaction to Hitchcock films.Kudos to everyone that was involved with this film.  I hope to see it on DVD soon, as it seems a film worthy of the spectacular video and audio of that medium.  Vertigo is truly a masterpiece of cinema- and yes, a great Hitchcock film!",9,2,4,24 June 2000
Independence Day," A sad commentary on the insecurity of a nation.
","This piece of tripe was one of the worst and most offensive movies I have ever seen. 0 out of 10. Negative numbers, even. Was there one, single original idea in the whole film? Not that I could spot. The aliens were a bald faced copy of H.R. Giger's 'Alien.' Their fighter craft were knockoffs of those used in 'War Of The Worlds', released more than 40 years prior. The idea that a computer virus could be used to defeat an alien technology millions of times more advanced than our own is insulting to anyone with half a brain. It's been done, and the idea comes off as badly here as before. (Read '3001: Final Odyssey' by Arthur C. Clarke.)These points alone aren't enough to ruin a movie completely; they merely add to the ridiculousness of it in this case. When ID was released, I read an article in Time magazine that talked about the psychology behind the movie. At the time, the United States had run out of Enemies. The Soviet Union wasn't a threat anymore, and the Middle East had already been pounded into submission during the Gulf War. There was no one for us to pick on, to show our overwhelming superiority to. Sensing the void, Hollywood created a new enemy in the race of planet conquering aliens seen in this film. And they made that enemy seem so invincible that it's all the more remarkable in the end when the macho Americans are able to defeat them single-handedly. Yes, it is the good old USA that saves the day, all by itself. Wil Smith's machismo is nauseating. In a movie that doesn't take itself so seriously (Men In Black) this kind of acting is entertaining. But not here.I am an American, and I take pride in America. But this movie exemplifies everything that is wrong with our outlook. We shouldn't have to build up our self esteem by pretending we are so superior, even to alien races who have conquered space. From a credibility standpoint, this is absurd. Like so many bad sci-fi movies, the producers never stopped to consider the unlikeliness of the scenario. Without going on a tirade about 'alien paranoia'- that is, the belief that extra terrestrial life forms are always hostile and want to steal our planet- I'll just say this: to say that the 'Melissa' or the 'I Love You' virus would be effective against their technology would be like saying that a couple of guys armed with pea shooters could take out an entire Panzer tank division.Don't waste your time with this. Watch an intelligent sci-fi movie, like '2001: A Space Odyssey', or 'Contact.' Films like that make you think; ID4 makes you want to sink back in the lazyboy, crack open another beer, and say 'Hot dang, we kicked some alien a**!'",1,19,37,5 July 2000
Contact," A truly masterful film
","Contact is one of the best films I have ever seen.  I would strongly encourage anyone who sees this movie to also read Carl Sagan's novel.  While Sagan remains one of my heroes and one of the greatest popularizers of science, frankly Contact the novel was a disappointment.  Although the underlying story was brilliant, Sagan includes just a bit too much technical jargon even for someone with a background in astronomy.  However, reading the novel gives some much needed background and fills in a few gaps that the film leaves out.The best thing about Contact was Jodie Foster's performance.  Throughout the film she captures perfectly the essence of Ellie Arroway: a brave, sincere, lonely (but ever-optimistic), STRONG woman.  The scenes beginning from the launch of the Machine and ending with Arroway's return to Earth are some of the most well-acted scenes I have ever viewed. Foster's looks, her words and emotions, are more sincere than some people ever get in real life.  I weep openly every time I watch. Foster deserved an Oscar for her stellar performance, but to my knowledge she wasn't even nominated.  The rest of the characters in the movie aren't nearly as strong, but passable. Interestingly, in the novel Palmer Joss's character was more like the suicidal bomber, though not as extreme.  (I was really looking forward to seeing the huge tattoo of the Earth that Palmer Joss had on his chest, but I guess Matthew McConaghey said no!)Although not completely scientifically accurate, Contact was probably as close as Hollywood will ever come, apart from 2001: A Space Odyssey.  This film gives a really good glimpse inside the world of radio astronomy, and what SETI (The Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence) has been doing for years.  In fact one of SETI's most prominent figures, Jill Tarter, noted that this movie was 'almost my life.'  If we ever do make contact with another intelligence in the Universe, it will probably happen the way it does in this film (advances in technology aside).  And to anyone who complained about the alien, please, just stick with Independence Day and the like from now on. Obviously the point of this film completely passed you by.Contact is a masterful vision of what we all hope for in life- to find some meaning. Whether it be through religion or science, Contact shows us that the two need not be in conflict. While this may be seen by some as a Hollywood sugar-coating of the issue, it heartens me to see the two sides reconciled. I sincerely hope that this story is one day played out in our world (preferably in my lifetime!)",10,0,2,6 January 1999
The Birds," A pleasant surprise that shows Hitchcock's versatility
","A lot has been said about 'The Birds' already, so I'll just throw in my quirky observations and be done with it. I had never seen it from start to finish, and having seen most of Hitchcock's other films, I was curious as to how it would stand up. I expected not to like it, but I wound up giving it a 7 in the voting booth.I have to echo that the special effects were innovative for the time period. They weren't nearly as cheesy as I expected. The thing that annoys me about later Hitchcock films is his incessant use of backdrops. Hitch hated shooting on location, but after the 1950s the backdrop technique was badly outdated. He should have made the effort to do more location shooting. For example, in the scene in which Tippi Hedron is in the motorboat, we see a real live shot of her bringing it into shore and getting out of it. Why then, if she was actually there in the bay for that scene, did Hitch have to shoot the rest of the boat scene against a backdrop? Oh well.I can't for the life of me see Hitch's attraction to Tippi Hedron. She's a mediocre actress at best, and I find her voice to be nasally and grating. I would have loved to see Ingrid Bergman in this role. Perhaps if she had been cast the writers would have re-written the story and actually made it interesting.The second half of The Birds makes up for the boring, slow paced first half. I never thought of 'Psycho' as a horror film- I saw it as more of a documentary, a psychological thriller. But 'The Birds' was truly terrifying. As has been said before, the reasons for this are the lack of soundtrack, the use of 'ordinary' creatures like birds as monsters, and the tension leading up to climactic moments. Nothing like 'The Birds' had been done up to that time, and nothing has been done like it since. People were afraid of Martians before they saw 'War of the Worlds', and they were afraid of sharks before they saw 'Jaws.' Not many people were afraid of seagulls before seeing 'The Birds.'I thought the scene inside the cafe was hilarious. The doomsayer, the angry fisherman, and the elderly ornithologist had me cackling. I don't even know if this scene was meant to be funny, and not a single reviewer other than myself has mentioned it as being humorous. By contrast, I didn't laugh once when I saw 'The Trouble With Harry', which was supposed to be a dark comedy. I think that what Hitch tried to do there, he got right here.
I loved the ending to 'The Birds.' I think its strength lies in its ambiguity. After such a surrealistic story, it was the only ending that was appropriate. 'The Birds' is truly a unique film, both among Hitchcock's own body of work and cinema in general.",7,1,3,18 September 2000
