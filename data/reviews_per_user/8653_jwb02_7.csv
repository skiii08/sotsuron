The Blair Witch Project," Funny, scary, really scary
","This movie was first funny. It was like a comedy for a good bit of the film. Then it was scary about midway through. And then, at the end, it was really scary. I was shocked, terrified, horrified, and every other word you can think of. At the end, my heart was pounding, and the hair on my arms was literally standing on end. I found out just how disturbing the film was, when I got home. I went upstairs to go to bed, and found myself leaving the hall light on that I usually turn off. Now I'm sure this is nothing you haven't heard already, but I would really like to recommend this wholeheartedly. Listen to the stories at the beginning, because you will not fully understand the film if you don't. If you do listen to the beginning, the ending will become clear, and horrify the f*** out of you! I give it a 10 out of 10.",7,1,1,31 July 1999
Your Name.," Excellent anime - a cross between Eternal Sunshine and Source Code
","A lovely, beautifully-animated Japanese anime film. It's alternately funny, exciting, and deeply tender and touching. It has a wonderful mix of sci-fi elements while still being completely grounded in realism. I found myself reminded of the emotional highs, seemingly doomed romances, and clever sci-fi of a couple of my favorite films: Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Source Code. A wonderful film that I am looking forward to watching again.",9,1,4,25 August 2018
American Pie," American Pie - much sweeter than it looks
","'American Pie' is a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful film. I saw 'South Park' the same day, and 'American Pie' totally blew it away. The first scene is can't miss, so don't get to the theater late. On the outside, this film appears to be a buncha horny teens vowing to get laid by prom night. It looks like a totally distasteful movie. But you know, this movie is very tasteful. It's better than 'warm apple pie', as they said in the movie. Sure, it has it's gross scenes, but you know, it's all done in relatively good taste. Despite the appearance that the message is for teens to have sex as soon as possible, it's not. There is a message which lies beneath. Sex is not the most important thing in high school, but it sure seems that way. There is a nice message, which plays in near the end of the movie. If you like to laugh, and can take a couple of gross-out scenes, then take a look at 'American Pie', the best film of the year.",8,0,0,18 July 1999
He Got Game," Spike Lee Misses Mark With Unnecessary Film
","'He Got Game' was a horrible film. First of all, Ray Allen? You can play basketball, but you can't act. Sorry. The amount of graphic sexual content was unnecessary and revolting. They made getting into college look like an orgy. If you haven't already seen this movie, then be glad. The ending was very confusing, and the whole movie was too. I give it a 3 out of 10, and only because Denzel Washington is so great.",3,6,16,19 July 1999
Scream," If you haven't seen it, where the heck have you been?
","'Scream' happens to be the first horror movie I ever watched. So of course I was terrified out of my mind. What a horror movie to start on. I was shocked and horrified by the amount of blood in this movie. Well, that was back in 1997, and now I've seen almost any horror movie you can think of. Was I only scared by 'Scream' because it was the first movie I'd seen with so much blood? The answer is no. I've seen this movie at least 40 times, and enjoy it every time. Each time I watch, I discover something new I didn't realize before. I was obviously disappointed that Neve Campbell didn't show it all, but it probably would've been rated NC-17. So that was a good call. Of course Neve didn't go nude in 'Wild Things' either. She's a rather respectable actress. 'Scream' scared me out of my mind, and I'll admit it, I slept with the lights on after I watched. I gave it a perfect 10.",9,0,0,18 July 1999
Carrie," Stephen King's First and Best Hit
","Stephen King has had an outstanding writing career, and I'm sorry about his accident. His first novel, and my personal favorite was 'Carrie'. 'Carrie' was an engaging, intriguing story, and I was on the edge of my seat literally just reading it. First of all, I would like to say that 'Carrie' was an incredibly better book than movie. Still, I gave it a 9 out of 10. The book was like off the scale. 12 out of 10 or something. I loved how the book got to the ending. The movie was still scary, but they took away some of the story from the book. It would've been cool if they'd left some of the scenes alone. Oh well, it's all you can expect from a book made into a movie. I was totally afraid of Carrie's mom. What a freak! She was constantly worshiping God, but at the same time looked like the devil. The only Stephen King movie that came close to this, was 'Pet Sematary', which was horrifying. Stephen King is a wonderful writer, and I thank God that his wife pulled his first story out of the trash can. Otherwise, we'd have no 'Carrie'. Once again, I give it 9 out of 10.",8,0,0,29 July 1999
The Sixth Sense," Best movie of the year, and maybe ever!
","There have been plenty of good movies this year, that I enjoyed. Such as 'Arlington Road', 'Varsity Blues', 'American Pie', 'Austin Powers 2', 'Outside Providence', 'The Mummy', 'Bowfinger', and even 'The Blair With Project', but none have lived up to the excellence of 'The Sixth Sense'. 'The Sixth Sense' is the best movie I have seen in a long time. You could actually feel Cole's anguish. And to those of you who don't like 'horror' movies, this isn't one of them. This is a wonderful film, which will chill you at times, but it has no really gory parts. This is not a 'Scream' movie, yet it has been #1 in the box office 5 weeks in a row! 'Star Wars' wasn't even #1 that long! This is definitely the best movie of the year, and I don't expect to see a better one. Not only that, I expect that this film will be remembered as one of the greatest of all time. I wish I had a bigger scale! I give this a 10 out of 10, but wish I could give it a 20 out of 10!",9,0,0,11 September 1999
