Iron Man 3," What is this movie... really??!!??
","What a nice beginning.. Iron Man 3 for like what? 10 - 15 minutes?First I want to ask a question. Is this even an Iron Man movie? Or we should rather called it a movie about Tony stark, the new McGyver?Countless Plot holes and illogical nonsense then starting to emerges, from the uselessness of Yinsen, to the 'what the hell is the usage of mark 42?!' seriously, in the avengers tony uses the mark 6 and 7 armor against chtauri (a very powerful race of alien) and Thor (God of thunder) and it didn't even brake. But in this movie, a little scratch from the 'heat guys', and it goes kaboom! WTH!? all the armor in this movie is supposed to be stronger than Mk 7. Oooh, and it goes on... How in the hell could they just hack and control War Machine armor that easily? why does Rhody wore a green polo shirt for work? Why does Maya, a scientist that spends so many years in a dedicated work, become so undecisive after just one or two sentences from tony stark? Why didn't tony removes the chest reactor in the prequel movies if its that easy? WTH is happened to pepper?And as if that isn't enough... They broke The Mandarin, Iron Man arch nemesis.. and AIM too I swear to God.. if I could cry, I'll cry..As for the jokes, it was funny, at first Then, you'll get sick from the overdoseWell, overall I give it a 5 out of 10 stars for the actors, actions, and special effect (although it was not that spectacular)Maybe we should ask, is this movie really suitable to be exist as one of the story in the marvel universe?",5,82,163,26 April 2013
Fast & Furious 6," Well Packed Action-Comedy-Consistency
","Nice opening title by the way...FF6 have everything that a summer movie should. Fast packed action, interlude comedy that makes us laugh, consistency, steady acting, and not that many plot holes that could ruin the movie.First of all, after the movie started (about 10 minutes), my mind kept thinking about this movie should have a sequel. The action scenes of FF6 have a nice varieties and also an excellent climax graphic, cause its going up all the way along with the movie plot (seriously, i think the tank scene is great and after that it could be an anticlimax, but i was wrong because the plane scene is absolutely amazing). And of course besides the car showdown, there was this nice fighting scene all over the place. For the comedy side, This movie have quite a nice jokes that serve their purpose (as an intermission between action scene), and classy one too. Take example at the skyline-charger joke, that's my favorite one (since FF1). Also, Roman Pierce's stupidity, and few other jokes that go well for the tone of the movie.What makes FF6 even greater is the consistency factor, and not just to the scenes of this movie, but also to the prequel ones. Fast & Furious 6 shows that all of 5 movies before this one matters (yes, including FF Tokyo Drift). They don't dump away people and proves that they still exist in this saga's timeline (like Elena, and even Braga).Plot holes... yea, this movie has some. A little this and a little that, but in my opinion, it doesn't matter. What did you expect should be a blowing mindless (sort of) action movie, and you got that while watching this movie. Sure it gets kinda boring in the middle, but i assure you that it'll all paid off once you get to the peak of this movie.To sum up, Fast & Furious 6 proves me something. After i watched Fast5 (where the post credit scene shows the picture of letty) and there's a rumor that there'll be a sequel after this, part of me cannot help to thinking skeptical. How the hell are they gonna make a movie that gonna top this one (action-wise), and they just did. So, applause for this movie cause it makes me happy... 8 of 10.*P.S. you might want to re-watch FF Tokyo Drift after watching this movie",8,9,15,27 May 2013
Pacific Rim," Just the Way I Expected... More or Less
","First of all, i've gotta say that when you go to watch a movie, you must have some sort of expectation about the movie that you're gonna watch. It's the thing that you expect, that you hope'll happened in that movie. I'll tell you what my expectation about this Pacific Rim movie. I expect that this movie will give me some sort of new view (since i'm a big fat fan of scifi, giant robots, and monsters) and combination of a post apocalyptic movie and monster attack. I expect a more advance CGI and special effect from the robots (it's called Jaeger) and all of the fight scenes with the monsters (it's called Kaiju), at least above transformers level, but on a bigger scale. And most important of all, i want some logical explanation of whatever happens, not just some nonsense that they threw away and patch it away with some cool graphics whatsoever (like in the 2012 movie). About the actors, now my expectation is towards the opposite direction, cause i don't intend to see some of great acting out of some (giant)monster vs(giant) robot movie, just a decent one is enough. Now if you go to see Pacific Rim in my set of expectation, you'll get what you want... well, more or less. Let's get to the downside first. The acting of almost all of the important cast were standard (some are below standard though). No special characteristic that will make them be remembered as all of them are replaceable (Except RonPerlman's unique appearance, though I don't really know his function in the first place). The plot graphics fluctuates up and down as the movie running as some scenes are making you sleepy, but another makes you unbelievably psyched (hint: the fisticuffs side). Talk about plot holes, at the beginning of the movie the logics are lined up pretty well. By the time the movie reached half time the plot holes seems to appear pretty often, though more or so its still edible. All of that thing aside, what makes Pacific Rim a great movie is the main reason that you watch it in the first place. Yes! Its the monsters and the robots. I gotta give a credit to Guilermo Del Toro, thus he's brave enough and willing to make this movie in the first place. To count that there's not that many movie with giant monster theme or giant robot theme (except maybe from Japan, which many of us are unfamiliar with), but to combine it into one clash is one of the most brilliant and brave idea ever come in Hollywood. Kaiju designs are of course not childish (comparing to Godzilla movies from Japan), as it is more chilling and frightening, since Del Toro's experience in making 'monsters'is beyond perfection. Also the destruction caused by the monsters are illustrated nicely, as we are shown how the earth, cities, and its people are transformed, years after the attack. As for the Jaeger, they have a very excellent design, with various forms, and human pilots (remind us of the mobile suit in Gundam series, or the robot in the movie Robot Jox in the late 80's), a very unique concept which make a good response for the Kaiju attack in an intense, life risking fight. For conclusion, If you unsure whether to watch Pacific Rim of not, just remember that what you seek in this movie is not some sort of amazing Oscar acting, but rather a stress release movie about a post apocalyptic monster attack world, with cool giant robots battle. Maybe you'll love it for the most part if you're a fan-boy. Objectively... 6.5 stars out of 10.",7,10,24,11 July 2013
