50 First Dates," 'Groundhog Day' ripoff
","Lets see... How can we make a movie like GROUNDHOG DAY but use Adam Sandler to ruin it? Isn't Adam Sandler becoming a little played? A little 'so last year'? I mean does this idiot ever change his physical character? He's the least versatile actor in the business. They can actually name his characters the same in all of his movies and they could all be sequels. Is he so one-tracked that he always has to play a character that's always 'caring, cute, but a little dense' dumb-butt. And what's with the way he talks? I don't know any other guy in his late 30's that talks that way. My God, That's the way teenagers talk when they're trying to be sweet, caring and innocent to a girl. It's becoming sooo played. Adam Sandler has taken the same road as other great comedians like Eddie Murphy, Steve Martin, Jim Carey. Their comedy/drama roles are ruining their comedianship. If you rent this DVD, check out the blooper scenes and see what a real Lame-brain this guy really is; all the other actors in this movie has to remind him what his lines are and his reaction is always the same: 'Uhh, I messed up. Sorry.' 'maybe if I act really dumb and slow-minded people will think i'm cute and sweet and not realize how stupid I really am'.",Null,0,0,16 June 2004
