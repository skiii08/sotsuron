Ford v Ferrari," Breathtaking movie
","Christian Bale gives an outstanding preformance as Ken Miles in this movie. He really portrays the character credibly. In addition, the chemistry between Matt Damon and Christian Bale is sublime. You also get a really good view into the corporate side of things and understand what is at stake for Ford and Ferrari. Perfect movie for all car lovers!",10,3,6,2 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The misjudged prequel jem
","Revenge of the sith is a movie often judged by many for beeing lacking and soulless. Although the movie contains bad screenwirting and some scenes where actors underdeliver. The movie is action packed from start to finish where love, power and betrayal make the viewers sit at the edge of their seat. Through the whole movie. Superstars like Samuel L. Jackson and Christopher Lee elevates the movie exerience with their talents. Epic fighing scenes in space and on the ground baffels everyone who experience them. In addition, the touching story of good becoming evil is truly a welltought out tale which Gorge Lucas had been setting up for over two decades.
In conclution. Give this movie a chance. It's a good movie experience. Despite what the internet says about the movie. This jem from the starwars prequal series has been wrongly hated and aged quite well. This is why I like this movie and I think you will to, just watch it with an open mind.",8,2,3,7 September 2018
