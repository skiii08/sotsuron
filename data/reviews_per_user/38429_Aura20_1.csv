The Blair Witch Project," Not the scariest movie ever made
","Okay, maybe I'm just too old for this movie.   I'm in my 30's and most of the audience looked to be in their early 20's.  I've seen a lot of horror movies over the years ... The Exorcist, The Shining, Alien, Amityville Horror, etc. etc. etc. and this movie is NOT the scariest ever made.  With that said, it was an entertaining movie.  The acting was great and made the premise that this is a documentary seem genuine.   But is it just me or did anyone else get annoyed by the constant bickering of the 3 characters?  They also used the 'F' word way too much ... oh my God, I guess I am getting old!",Null,0,1,1 August 1999
