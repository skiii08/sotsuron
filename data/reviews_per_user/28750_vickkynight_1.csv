Moneyball," Moneyball's worth the price fo admission
","I enjoy movies, go to many festivals, as well as preview screenings, and I am enjoying posting the reviews on IMDb for all to see.So far, I am only posting reviews of the films I have liked. Recently, I had the chance to see 'Moneyball,' and I've been meaning to post my review.The main cast does a wonderful job, starting off with Brad Pitt, who will surely receive Oscar buzz for this role. Playing Billy Beane - a failed prospect of the New York Mets, but a G.M. with a chance to do something special - Pitt thrives. Although a successful talent evaluator, Beane is strapped by the financial constraints the Oakland team has put on him. Enter Jonah Hill.Playing Peter Brand, a numbers guy, he teams up with Beane to change the entire approach to drafting players and signing free agents. The results make for a riveting movie that is as much about life as it is baseball.Filmed in the style of a docudrama, Moneyball is one of the best in this style of film. Go see it, even if you're not a baseball fan. Very real, and it plays that way. While I enjoyed the ending very much, it certainly is NOT a Hollywood ending. See the movie, and you will know what I mean.",9,4,7,26 September 2011
