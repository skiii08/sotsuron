The Blair Witch Project," There's nothing good about this
","This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. It's just the characters walking through the woods. I have no idea why this was successful. It's in black-and-white, the camera-work is all over the place, the characters aren't likable and the acting is appallingly bad.This isn't scary, suspenseful, gory - or anything else that a horror film should be. The supposed story/legend behind this was obviously fake from the start.If I could give this no stars, I would have done so.",1,4,6,20 April 2017
Saturday Night Fever," Excellent disco film
","This drama film is about a 19-year-old working-class Italian-American who lives with his family in Brooklyn. He's unhappy at home and has a dead-end job. He lives for the weekend, when - due to his good looks and dancing ability - he's very popular at the disco that he goes to with his friends. There's a PG version of this great film, which is very different and inferior to the original.",10,1,2,27 April 2017
Vertigo," Painfully slow and boring
","This is meant to be a thriller?! This is one of the slowest, most boring films I've ever seen - and I've seen thousands of films. I watch better films than this every week. Why do so many critics say that this is the best film ever made? It isn't even Hitchcock's best film - Psycho is much better.",1,9,23,14 April 2017
Black Swan," Excellent
",This is a psychological drama thriller about a ballerina in New York City who appears to be suffering from borderline personality disorder. Natalie Portman plays the protagonist very well - and Barbara Hershey is good as her overbearing mother. It's one of the best films I've ever seen - and I've seen thousands. It's so good that I enjoy it a lot despite having no interest in ballet.,10,1,2,14 April 2017
Scarface," Brilliant gangster film
","This is a remake that's better than the original. It holds your concentration, despite being nearly three hours long.Al Pacino is excellent as a Cuban who moves to Miami and goes from rags to riches as a violent drug dealer.This film has justifiably become more popular over the years.",9,0,2,21 April 2017
Se7en," Brilliant
",This is an excellent serial killer thriller. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt play police detectives who together are tracking a serial killer who kills people who have each committed one of the seven deadly sins in a way that's relevant to the specific sin. Kevin Spacey plays the killer.,9,4,6,20 April 2017
As Good as It Gets," Implausible; too long; not funny
","This is a grossly overrated, overlong, sentimental film. It's meant to be a comedy, but isn't funny. None of the characters are likable - Helen Hunt's character is horrible. It's unbelievable that Jack Nicholson's character (who's selfish and dislikes everyone) would do anything to help his waitress or neighbour.",1,6,14,23 April 2017
The Hunger Games," Overblown nonsense
",This is a dystopian action adventure thriller in which teenagers are forced to fight to the death. It's a ridiculous premise - yet the film is serious - it's not a satire or an allegory.Jennifer Lawrence was well-built and in her early twenties when this was filmed. She certainly doesn't pass for the thin sixteen-year-old whom her character is meant to be.,2,4,6,4 May 2017
Shaun of the Dead," Doesn't work on any level
","This is supposed to be a romantic zombie comedy. However, it's not romantic, scary or funny. None of the characters are interesting or entertaining.The New Zealand film Braindead is of this genre mix and is massively better, despite being filmed on a much smaller budget, over a decade earlier.",1,9,20,14 April 2017
The Notebook," Lame chick flick
","I'm puzzled at how popular this sentimental melodrama is. The on-off couple at the centre of this aren't likable, nor are they believable together. Perhaps it's impossible for me to like it simply because it's intended for a female audience.",1,8,13,20 April 2017
Home Alone," Good Christmas film
","This is one of the better Christmas films. In this comedy, a child is accidentally left at home when his family go to France on holiday. He has to defend the house from two burglars.There are some parts of the story which are ridiculous. For example, how could everyone forget Kevin? How could he have slept through the huge amount of noise from everyone else getting up, getting ready, talking and leaving?",7,0,0,22 April 2017
500 Days of Summer," A confusing, incomplete, haphazard mess
","I love Zooey Deschanel in New Girl, so I was looking forward to watching this - especially because the critics love it. I was massively disappointed by this boring, confusing film which jumps back and forth in time at random, showing a minority of the 500 days of the relationship between the two protagonists. Even if you played the days in order, it would still be severely incomplete and not entertaining. This film was misleadingly promoted as a lighthearted romcom with a likable female lead. In fact, there's very little humour in this miserable drama. It's not sexy or romantic. Neither character is likable and they're not suited as a couple. The acting and writing are awful. All the way through, Summer says she doesn't believe in love, yet Tom keeps trying to make her fall in love with him. After they split, she quickly falls in love with someone else, which only serves to make her character even more unlikeable.",1,5,8,25 April 2017
Juno," Overrated, unfunny and unrealistic
","This is one the worst films I've ever seen - I don't know why it's popular. Skinny dorky teenage boys don't even get the opportunity to hold hands with girls (unless they're rich), let alone have sex with pretty girls - so Juno wanting anything to do with Paulie is unbelievable. Juno's reaction to being pregnant by a dork at 16 is ludicrous. She takes the news calmly at though it's nothing. First she casually decides to have an abortion, then casually changes her mind to have the baby adopted - with less emotion than most people expend on deciding what to wear or eat today.",1,8,12,17 April 2017
L.A. Confidential," Very disappointing
","Critics love this film and it won major awards, so I was expecting it to be very entertaining. I was very disappointed at how slow and dull it is. It's far too long for the small amount of actual material in it. The characters are dull and there are a lot of scenes that are just boring conversations.Kim Basinger plays a call girl, so she should certainly have at least one good sex scene. However, we don't even see her nude - let alone having sex.We don't see the murder that's at the centre of the plot - we only see the corpses afterwards and people talking about it. That means that we don't know exactly what happened.",2,1,15,20 April 2017
Knocked Up," Funny film with an implausible plot
","This is a romantic sex comedy film about a television presenter, Alison, who becomes pregnant after a drunken one-night stand with a man whom she meets in a nightclub. There are a lot of laughs in this film, but they're diminished somewhat by the implausibility of an attractive, intelligent career girl not being on contraception and choosing to jump into bed with an irresponsible, overweight, uneducated, poor, unattractive, unemployed layabout.Leslie Mann is very good as Alison's sister, Debbie. This was followed by a spin-off, This Is 40 - in which Debbie and her husband are the main characters.",7,1,1,4 May 2017
Horrible Bosses," Jennifer Aniston is brilliant
",This black comedy film is about three employees who have awful bosses whom they hate. They decide that the best solution to their work problems is to kill them. Jennifer Aniston is brilliant as one of the bosses - a slutty dentist who tries to seduce and blackmail her assistant into having sex with her.,7,0,1,21 April 2017
Life of Pi," Ridiculous nonsense
","This is a survival drama film narrated by Pi, an Indian man in his forties who lives in Canada. He tells the story of his early life. Most of it is about when he was 16 and travelled across the Pacific Ocean towards Canada in a ship with his family and a load of animals. Part way across, the ship sinks, killing the protagonist's family and many of the animals. He escapes on a lifeboat with a zebra, orangutan, hyena and tiger. The hyena kills the zebra and orangutan. The tiger kills the hyena. Pi and the tiger eventually reach Mexico. Later, he says that the animals were actually people. This film is ridiculous and can't be taken seriously as a survival film. It's too far-fetched. The tiger would have killed Pi and eaten him. Even without the tiger, Pi would not have survived and reached Mexico in the lifeboat. Even if you believe the second story that the animals were actually people, he still couldn't have survived for that long. The boat would have sunk, or Pi would have died of thirst, starvation, hypothermia/hyperthermia (depending on the temperature) - or a combination of them. The only reason that I haven't given this 1 is that the special effects are good.",2,0,3,22 May 2017
Lost in Translation," Very little happens in this boring film
",This grossly overrated film is dull and lifeless. None of the characters are likable. All the attempts at humour fall flat.Scarlett Johansson was far too young to play her role. Opening the film showing her in her knickers misleads the viewers into thinking that the film will be erotic.,1,8,16,17 April 2017
Romeo + Juliet," Set in the present day, but with 16th c dialogue!
","The way Shakespeare wrote is so far removed from modern English that it's like a different language. When I tried to read his work, I needed to often refer to a book which translated words and phrases of that time into modern English. I had to refer to it so many times that it made reading any one of his plays a long, slow and tiresome task. I was very pleased when I heard that a modern remake of Romeo and Juliet was being made, so that I would be able to understand it without translation. I was puzzled and very disappointed when I watched it and it was in the original dialogue! It had already been filmed many times in its original dialogue and 16th century setting. What's the point in setting it in the present day if you're going to use archaic dialogue?!",1,0,1,17 April 2017
American Hustle," An overlong, complicated, boring mess
","Critics think this film is brilliant. However, it has many faults. It's too long, confusing and complicated. It's supposed to be a comedy - but isn't funny at all.The only character who's in the slightest bit interesting is the histrionic who's played by Jennifer Lawrence.",2,1,3,17 April 2017
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Overlong, boring nonsense
","This is one of the worst films I've ever seen - and I've seen thousands. I can't understand how any adult can enjoy this tedious, childish nonsense. I watched it because of all the hype, critical acclaim, awards won and box office success - but there's nothing about it that I enjoyed. I watch better films than this every day.",1,2,8,14 April 2017
Grease," Very old 'teenagers'!
","This is a romantic comedy musical film that was released in 1978, but is set in 1958 in Los Angeles.The film is well-written and well-acted, with good song-and-dance routines. Its main fault is that many of the high school pupils are played by people who were well into their twenties or even their thirties and don't pass for the 17 or 18-year-olds that they're playing.",6,1,5,16 July 2017
Cast Away," Dull, slow and overlong
","I don't know why this film is popular. It starts quite well, but the large majority of it is just the protagonist alone on a desert island with very little happening. It should be much shorter.After such a long, boring middle, I was expecting a happy ending. However, I was disappointed there as well. It has a feel-bad ending: he returns home, expecting to be welcomed. He instead finds out that he was presumed dead and everyone who knew him has moved on. That includes his partner, who is now married and has a child with her husband.",2,0,7,17 April 2017
American Beauty," Excellent satirical drama
","American Beauty is a great satirical drama about middle-class suburbia, family and society in general. The writing, acting and directing are brilliant. It was deservedly very successful at the time and was loved by critics and audiences alike. It won many awards. I'm puzzled as to why it's no longer regarded by many as one the best films and why it's not talked about as much.",10,1,2,17 April 2017
Silver Linings Playbook," Overrated; boring; unrealistic; too long
","This is a drama film which is misleadingly described as a comedy- drama. It's one of the worst films I've ever seen - and I've seen thousands. It's boring, miserable, too long and not believable. Jennifer Lawrence was far too young to play her role. Her character - a celibate widow who used to be a slut - is a ridiculous character for someone of her age to play. Count up the total number of widows in their early twenties whom you personally know. Is the answer zero? I thought it would be. I don't know why Bradley Cooper received praise for his portrayal of a bipolar man. His acting in this film is wooden. He and Lawrence aren't believable as a couple.There's an unnecessary gambling subplot which isn't in the novel that the film is based on. The subplot adds nothing of value to the film and is merely an unnecessary, tacked-on distraction.",1,4,9,17 April 2017
No Strings Attached," Boring and unbelievable
","This is a good idea for a film, but this attempt to do such a story is a pathetic failure. It's not as bad as Friends with Benefits, which has the same storyline, but it's still awful.None of the characters are likable - and there's no chemistry between the two leads. They're a boring pair with little in the way of personalities. This film tries to be a romcom which turns into a serious drama. However, it fails to be any good at either.It's very disappointing to see Natalie Portman act so badly in this - putting in so little effort - just after her brilliant performance in Black Swan.",2,1,2,23 April 2017
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Ridiculous
","This comedy film is silly and ridiculous rather than funny. The only character in the film who is likable is pretty girl Knives, whom the protagonist Scott dumps. How can the audience root for Scott, when he's not likable - and he rejects the film's only likable character? It's ludicrous that hot girl Ramona wants a dorky, skinny lad.The story involves Scott having to physically fight off Ramona's seven evil exes. That's a ridiculous plot, because dating a single girl doesn't involve having to fight off her exes. The fight scenes look like video game footage and are bizarrely out of place in a feature film.",2,3,9,30 April 2017
Dirty Dancing," Chick flick
","This romantic drama dance film is one of the most popular films among female audiences. I think the reason that I can't enjoy it much is that it's so strongly aimed at female viewers.The songs and the dancing are good. This film is better than most chick flicks.It's set in the Catskill Mountains in New York in 1963, so it's bizarre that it includes 1980s songs.There is a prequel, Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights - and a remake. Both are inferior to the original.",4,1,9,3 July 2017
The Fault in Our Stars," Sentimental and miserable wallow in cancer & death
","This romantic drama film is about a teenage couple in the Midwest who are both dying of cancer. This sentimental film is very disappointing - I don't know why it's so popular. It was misleadingly promoted as a film in which the main characters enjoy fulfilling, happy lives in spite of their bad health. It's actually a feel-bad film about cancer and death. Why did they cast a plain girl as Hazel? It would have been much more powerful if they'd cast a beautiful girl, who loses her looks as she becomes more seriously ill. I can see that the makers of the film were aiming it at teenage girls by having a plain protagonist get a tall, handsome, older boy who's out of her league. However, by doing so they've made the relationship unrealistic and the film unappealing to the rest of the population. They also made the mistake of having her no more or less ill at the end of the film than she is at the beginning of it.Eighteen-year-old Gus tells Hazel that he's a virgin. It's highly unlikely that a lad who's tall and of significantly above-average looks would reach 18 without having intercourse, even if he has a false leg. Even if he were that unfortunate, he wouldn't admit it to a girl whom he's sexually attracted to - because she'd laugh at him and never want anything more to do with him. Hazel is surprised, but not bothered. They have sex together once, but we don't find out whether or not she'd previously had sex with anyone else.The Amsterdam portion of the film is very disappointing. Hazel is inexplicably angrily disappointed about a novel ending abruptly and travels to Amsterdam (four thousand miles away), to meet the author. They go for three days - who makes an eight thousand mile return trip for such a short time?! This reclusive author pays for these two strangers to him to have dinner in an upmarket restaurant and then welcomes them into his house. However, he then angrily rebukes Hazel for criticising the end of the novel in question. In the restaurant, the teen couple pretend to the staff that they're married. This is totally unnecessary in present day Amsterdam - a very sexually liberal city! In any case, very few teens in the Western World are married. They're only in Amsterdam for two or three days, during which they choose to go to the Anne Frank House - but don't even suggest going to the red-light district! Are these the most boring teens in the world?! At Gus' funeral, Hazel is introduced as his 'special friend'. Who the hell uses that term in modern America when referring to young, heterosexuals who are in a sexual relationship?! The usual term used - even by prudes - is girlfriend.We never find out anything about the two main characters lives before they had cancer. The film would have been better with some flashbacks to that, to give us more context and background of what their lives were like then.",2,2,4,6 May 2017
Saving Private Ryan," Good battle scenes, but plot is ridiculous and film is too long
",This is a World War II film about a group of soldiers who set out to find and send home a soldier whose brothers have been killed.The battle scenes at the beginning are very good - but that's the only good thing about this film. The plot is ridiculous - the army wouldn't devote soldiers to finding and bringing home one ordinary soldier - no matter how many people in his family had been killed. The film is far too long and a lot of it is slow.,4,7,14,7 May 2017
Revolutionary Road," An awful couple shout at each other over and over again
","This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. None of the characters are likable. A boring man and a horrible woman don't achieve their pipe dreams, so they have loads of blazing rows. This unlikeable couple shout at each other at the top of their voices over and over and over again. There was so much hype and praise heaped on this film and The Reader in 2008 - yet both films are dreadful. They're a waste of Kate Winslet's acting talent - she's great in Heavenly Creatures.",1,5,8,22 April 2017
Room," Well-acted, but incomplete
","This is a drama film about a mother and five-year-old son who are held prisoner in their captor's shed. The child escapes and the mother is rescued. Then we see them reunited with their family.The acting is good. The huge deficiency of the film is that it starts towards the end of the victims' false imprisonment. They've been there for all of the son's life - and the mother has been there for two years previous to that, since being kidnapped. We don't see any of those years, the kidnapping, or any of the mother's life before she was kidnapped. We see very little of the captor.It's not believable that the captor would believe the story that the mother uses to allow the son to escape.The poster - showing the mother and son smiling at each other - misled us into believing that it's a feel-good film. Being left with PTSD and your rapist-kidnapper-captor's child isn't a happy ending.",5,14,34,13 May 2017
Dog Day Afternoon," Very good film with unexpected developments
","Al Pacino is at his best as a bank robber in this film. It's based on a real-life crime that happened in Brooklyn on a very hot day, 22 August 1972. This has drama and black humour. There's a big, unexpected twist during the robbery, after Pacino's character asks for his wife. This explains his unusual motive for his actions.",9,2,3,20 April 2017
Coyote Ugly," Dreadful film
","This 'small-town girl in the big city' film is really lame. Coyote Ugly attempts several things (humour, drama, romance, sexiness, feminism) and fails on all counts. The acting is awful; the characters are weak and incomplete. The film can't decide what it is or what pace to go at.",1,0,3,21 April 2017
Paranormal Activity," Boring
","This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. The early part of the film is boring conversations; the latter part is very little happening in the dark.This has none of the ingredients that a horror thriller film should contain: scares, thrills, suspense, gore etc.The couple at the centre of this aren't interesting or likable.I have no idea why this was so successful that it spawned a series of films.",1,0,1,20 April 2017
Friends with Benefits," Awful all-round
","This is a good idea for a film, which was done slightly less badly in No Strings Attached.The two main characters in this film are boring and unlikeable. Justin Timberlake's character lacks a personality and Mila Kunis' character is arrogant. It was promoted as funny, sexy and romantic - but it fails miserably on all three counts. This is one of the worst films I've ever seen - and I've seen thousands.",1,0,1,22 April 2017
Annie Hall," Very good romcom
","Woody Allen and Diane Keaton are brilliant in this well-written, well- acted romantic comedy. This is one of the best films of the genre.It shows very well how the two main characters have very different ways of seeing things, such as when he says that they hardly ever have sex, only three times a week - and she says that they have sex all the time - three times a week. The scenes with what the two main characters really mean in subtitles is very clever.Many people hate this film, but most of them are Star Wars fanatics who are still bitter - four decades on - that Annie Hall beat Star Wars to win the Academy Award for Best Picture.",9,1,2,24 April 2017
Men in Black," Good special effects is all it has
","Men in Black is a science-fiction comedy film set in New York City. It has very good special effects, but nothing else. It's not funny - and what little there is in the way of a storyline is lame. The writing and acting are mediocre; Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith have very different styles of acting which don't fit together.",3,1,4,27 April 2017
The Graduate," Mrs Robinson is repulsive
","This is a grossly overrated film, which could and should have been done much better. Mrs Robinson is an awful character who isn't likable at any point in the film. She should be a seductive, romantic, cougar-MILF. Instead, she's not particularly attractive and her personality is repugnant. She's arrogant, bossy, cold and aloof. She later turns manipulative, angry, dishonest and demanding. It's difficult to believe that Benjamin would be attracted to her in the first place. Before I watched it, I'd been told that it has a happy ending - but that's not the case. The situation that they'd be in after the film ends would be awful. They could live together, poor and estranged from their families - or split up and go back to their respective families apologetically.",2,4,12,17 April 2017
This Is Spinal Tap," Very good mockumentary
",This is a satirical mockumentary that follows a failing British rock band as they try to make a comeback by touring the United States. It's very well-written and well-acted. The main and supporting characters - and the interactions between them - are excellent.I don't know why the film wasn't very successful at cinemas. It became popular after being released on video and has gained a cult following.,8,1,4,9 July 2017
Avatar," Good special effects is all it has
",This science fiction adventure film set in the 2150s has very good special effects - but that's its only appeal. There's little else to enjoy in this rambling and insubstantial extraterrestrial fairy tale.I can't understand why this is the world's highest-grossing film of all time.,2,3,4,20 April 2017
There's Something About Mary," Best comedy ever!
","This is the funniest film I've ever seen - and I've watched hundreds of comedy films. This is laugh-out-loud hilarious. This is what a comedy film should be like. Sure, it's not realistic that Cameron Diaz's red-hot character would want someone average like Ben Stiller's character. However, if you can suspend your disbelief in that regard - the film is riotously funny.",10,0,0,14 April 2017
La La Land," The critics are wrong - this is an awful film
",I personally know many people who've seen this film - and all of them hate it. Every other review I've written is based on my own viewing - but I'm making an exception for this dreadful film. It sounds so bad that I haven't seen it and am repeating what they said - rather than subjecting myself to the hell of watching it.Here are the problems with this film:a) It's boring - especially in the middle. It's far too long for its content.b) Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are mediocre at singing and dancing. Good singing and dancing are essential in a musical film. c) Gosling's character is an arrogant snob who thinks that anyone who doesn't love jazz is beneath him.d) Stone's character lacks a personality.e) It's too unrealistic for anyone to take seriously as a romantic drama.f) There's nowhere near enough humour for it to work as a comedy.The critics and fans don't address these bad points. They don't deny them - they just ignore those faults or claim that they aren't a problem.,1,8,15,7 May 2017
Groundhog Day," Boring, unfunny rubbish
","This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. It's slow, dull, miserable and repetitive. None of the characters are likable. I have no idea why thousands of people claim that this is the best comedy film ever made. It's bad enough that there's this ridiculous myth that whether or not a rodent turns around can predict the length of the winter. To make a film based on such a thing is idiocy.",1,10,39,20 April 2017
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Grossly overrated nonsense
","This is a fantasy film, the first in the long-running series of Harry Potter films, and is also known as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. It is based on the novel of the same name, which is the first in the long-running series of novels.An orphan lives in Surrey with his aunt, uncle and cousin - all of whom resent him. He goes to live and study at Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in Scotland. I cannot understand the massive popularity of this film, or why it spawned so many sequels. It has dull dialogue, stock characters, mediocre acting and a ridiculous plot. Before I watched it I heard a lot of critics, journalists, filmgoers and people involved in making the film claim that there's a lot in the film for adult viewers to enjoy. I strongly disagree with them and I consider this to be a children's film. I can't see how any adult or teenager can enjoy this nonsense. I haven't seen any of the sequels and have no intention of doing so.",2,1,5,9 July 2017
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Doesn't work on any level
","I don't know why this awful action-comedy film is massively popular. The plot is ridiculous, the action is mediocre and it isn't funny.Why does the film portray Bogotá as a small settlement in a tropical rainforest? It's a very large city, that, because of its very high altitude, isn't hot.",1,4,13,27 April 2017
Die Hard," Brilliant action film
","This is perhaps the best action film ever. An off-duty policeman takes on a whole gang, using guns, bravery, psychological skill and some very clever and funny lines.The only reason that I'm not giving it 10 is that the beginning is slow.",9,0,2,14 April 2017
Psycho," Classic horror film
","This is a psychological horror thriller that is regarded to be the first slasher film.A secretary steals a $40,000 from her employer in Phoenix and drives to a motel in California, where she is killed by the motel's owner. Her boyfriend, her sister and a private investigator look for her. This film is very well-made and would have been ever better in colour.",8,0,1,16 July 2017
The Holiday," Boring and unfunny
","This is meant to be a comedy?! I didn't find it funny in the slightest. This film is too long and too slow. The storyline between Kate Winslet's character and Jack Black's is unrealistic. Even though Black isn't being the obnoxious, hyperactive, overbearing nuisance that he is in most of his films - he's still nowhere near appealing enough for pretty Winslet to want.",1,1,2,17 April 2017
Love Actually," Good acting, but some ridiculous stories
","This romantic comedy-drama film is set in November and December, mostly in London. It follows many interconnected people. The acting is good, but the tone is too sentimental and unrealistically optimistic.This film crams in too many stories, which are incomplete and don't have enough context and backstories. Some of the stories are ridiculously unrealistic. One involves a poor simpleton who can't get laid. He goes to Wisconsin, where hot girls throw themselves at him. A character in another strand is a Portuguese housekeeper who lives in France with her family, yet can't speak any French.",5,2,3,22 April 2017
12 Years a Slave," Slow, boring and too long
","This is a drama film set in the 1840s and 1850s. It's about an African-American man who was born free in New York. He's kidnapped in Washington, D.C. and sold into slavery to work on plantations in Louisiana - until freed twelve years later. The film is slow, boring and heavy-going. It doesn't give enough background and context for viewers who aren't knowledgeable of mid-19th century America. There's also very little about the protagonist's life before and after the twelve years that are the focus of the film.",2,6,11,13 May 2017
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Brilliant
","A great drama film set in a psychiatric ward in Oregon in 1963. Jack Nicholson is excellent as the protagonist, who is moved there from prison.The writing and acting are excellent and it deserves its place being regarded as one of the best films ever made.",9,1,3,20 April 2017
The Wolf of Wall Street," Overrated and too long
","This biographical criminal comedy film is about fraudulent stockbroker Jordan Belfort, and is based on his memoir. This film made a lot of money; it gained several awards and popularity with the critics.It lasts three hours, which is too long. For a comedy, it's nowhere near funny enough. None of the characters are likable or even sympathetic, so we can't side with or root for any of them.",3,2,4,1 July 2017
The Reader," Why did they make Kate Winslet so plain and unlikable?
","This grossly overrated and dull film is awful. Very few women in their thirties choose to have sex with 15-year-old boys. Why didn't the writers make Michael a few years older, to make the relationship believable?Why was Kate Winslet given a makeunder to make her so plain? Why did the writers give her a cold, aloof, unlikeable personality? Why would Michael be attracted to someone like that? She should have been beautiful, seductive, romantic, warm, loving, caring etc. - so that the audience would like her and believe the attraction that Michael has for her.The trial is stupid. The idea that Hanna would rather serve a much longer sentence because she's too ashamed to admit that, at the time of the crime, she was illiterate - is ridiculous. No matter how much shame there was to being unable to read, it was tiny in comparison to being a mass murderer. In any case, it would still have clearly been a mass murder of civilians even if you couldn't read, so she's still guilty. The film doesn't show any of the mass murder in question, which is yet another deficiency the film has.",2,0,5,22 April 2017
Hitch," Awful all-round
","This film is severely disappointing and was badly made. I was expecting it to be funny, which it isn't. I was expecting it to give good advice about how to get hot girls - which it doesn't.Will Smith is even more narcissistic in this than he is in most of his films. Kevin James' character is annoying and pathetic, rather than funny. I've never understood Eva Mendes' popularity - she's neither hot nor a good actress.",1,3,7,26 April 2017
The Terminal," Boring, slow and overlong
","This is one of the most boring films I've ever seen - I don't know why it did well. It's far too long. It's meant to be a comedy-drama, but it's neither funny, nor dramatic. Very little happens. None of the characters are interesting.This would have been better as an hour-long documentary.",1,2,4,17 April 2017
The Shawshank Redemption," Overrated
","This film wasn't that successful when it was released. Over the years since then, it's become regarded by many people as one of the best films ever made. It's an above-average prison film that's well-acted - but it's nothing special. It's slow and too long. Many fans of this film claim that it's a feel-good film - an uplifting story about friendship and mental strength. Some even claim that watching it can cure depressed viewers. However, it's a heavy-going film that includes beatings and rape.We never find out whether or not the protagonist committed the double murder that he's imprisoned for, which is a crucial point as a viewer. If he's innocent, then we should be on his side and want him to escape; if he's guilty, then he's not a sympathetic character.",6,0,2,17 April 2017
Scream," Very good slasher film
","This is one of the best slasher films, reviving the genre that first became popular with Halloween in 1978. Scream has strong characters, good acting, black humour and graphic murders. Killing Drew Barrymore's character is an excellent, unexpected start.",9,0,0,21 April 2017
Carrie," Very good horror film
","This is a classic horror film about a telekinetic teenage girl. It's well-written and well-acted. Sissy Spacek is excellent as the outcast Carrie White.I'm not giving it a 10 because early in the film they're playing volleyball on concrete (with too many players on one side), which would cause a lot of injuries to the players. It's played on grass, sand, on a smooth surface indoors or in water. Also, because of the ridiculous line by Sue's mother at the end, claiming that she's young enough that she'll forget about the massacre that she witnessed - she's 18, not 3!",9,0,0,17 April 2017
Raging Bull," Grossly overrated film about a horrible man
","I can't understand the huge amount of praise heaped on this film, which isn't even mediocre. It's in black and white, which reduces its impact. At the beginning, he's married - then his wife disappears without explanation and is never mentioned - then he pursues a young girl. The protagonist is a repulsive man whom it's impossible for anyone other than sociopaths to like or admire. The audience is supposed to root for and side with the protagonist in a sports film - you can't do that for this horrible man who beats his wife and family. There are many of Robert De Niro's films which I like a lot - but I hate this one.",1,13,29,20 April 2017
The Silence of the Lambs," One of the best thrillers ever
","This serial killer thriller is an excellent film that's well-written and well-acted. It fully deserves its many awards, popularity and acclaim. In fact, it's still underrated and deserves to be on lists of best films of all time.It's puzzling that critics claim that Vertigo is better.",9,0,2,20 April 2017
Speed," Good action thriller
",This is one of the best action thriller films. A policeman (played by Keanu Reeves) and a bus passenger (played by Sandra Bullock) join forces to stop an extortionist (played by Dennis Hopper) from blowing up a bus load of passengers.The sequel Speed 2 is awful.,8,0,0,20 April 2017
Pitch Perfect," Mediocre
","This is a musical comedy film about vocal groups at a university. It's not funny enough for a comedy. The quality of the singing varies, but it's not good enough for a musical film.It's impossible for us to believe that Rebel Wilson's character is 19. She was in her early thirties when she played her. Why didn't they have her play a mature student near her own age?",3,2,3,25 June 2017
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Great slasher film
","This is one of the best slasher films - its reputation has improved over the years. It's about the ghost of a murdered child killer who kills suburban teenagers.This has sequels and a remake, although this original is generally regarded as the best of the series.",8,1,2,21 April 2017
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Overrated boring childish nonsense
","This is one of the worst films I've ever seen - and I've seen thousands. If I could give it no stars, I would.It's just a children's fairy tale set in outer space. I can't understand how any adult can like this boring drivel - let alone how millions can claim that it's the best film ever. I watch better films than this every week. This isn't even one of the better sci-fi films: Starship Troopers, The Terminator and Terminator 2 are much better.",1,18,51,13 April 2017
Get Him to the Greek," Funny in parts
","This comedy film is a spin-off from Forgetting Sarah Marshall. Russell Brand plays British rock star Aldous Snow again. Jonah Hill is also in this film, but he plays a different character - a talent scout called Aaron Green. He has to take Aldous from London to the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles, where he is to perform.Some scenes are very funny, such as the drugs in the rectum and the threesome.",6,2,4,1 July 2017
Easy A," Overrated, unfunny, unbelievable
","This is a teen comedy film set in and around a high school in Ojai in Southern California. Emma Stone plays a 17-year-old girl who becomes infamous after she falsely claims to have had sex.Stone is a grossly overrated actress and none of the characters in the film are likable. Having her character become a notorious slut, in 21st century California, just for having sex once, is ludicrous. Most 17-year-olds have had sex.I don't know what the makers of this film were aiming for. The dialogue was toned down a lot from the original script and it is far too tame to be a raunchy sex comedy along the lines of a female version of American Pie. If Stone is trying to be this generation's Molly Ringwald, then she fails due to lack of likablity and acting talent.",2,2,4,23 June 2017
Slumdog Millionaire," Grossly overrated, dreadful film
","This must be the most overrated film of the 21st century. I don't know why it's held in such high regard by critics - or why it was very successful. It should have won Razzies. If I could give it no stars, I would. This film haphazardly cuts back and forth in time so you don't know where you are chronologically. It's not credible that a TV channel would torture a winner of its show. They love it when someone wins the jackpot, because it provides them with a great deal of good publicity.The romance between the protagonist and Frieda Pinto's character is preposterous and isn't adequately explained. Poor, skinny, geeky, teenage boys don't get to have sex with hot girls.This is promoted as a feel-good film, which is a huge lie. It's very much a feel-bad film. It includes severe poverty, false imprisonment, torture and a child being submerged in human excrement.",1,6,10,17 April 2017
The Social Network," Boring film about a narcissist
","This film won loads of awards, is loved by the critics and is popular with audiences. I was given the impression that it's a fast-moving, witty film with great characters. I was disappointed that it's dull and that its protagonist is a very unlikeable narcissist. I don't know whether or not it's an accurate depiction of Mark Zuckerberg, but it's not an entertaining portrayal. It seems that the audience is meant to side with and root for him - but that's difficult to do, because of how selfish and arrogant he is.",2,5,6,25 April 2017
Back to the Future," Silly and childish
","This is a time-travel adventure comedy film, set in California, starring Michael J. Fox. BTTF has a reputation as 'a film that's impossible to dislike'. We're supposed to ignore (or not notice) the plot holes and inconsistencies. I disliked this film when I watched it during my teens - and even more when I watched it during my twenties. I can't see how any adult can enjoy this childish nonsense.",2,9,38,8 May 2017
High Fidelity," A miserable and irritating film
","This is an awful film that doesn't have any likable characters. It was misleadingly marketed as a fun, happy romcom. It's actually a really bad drama.John Cusack plays an annoying, miserable record shop owner who incessantly goes on and on about his personal top five of this, that and the other. Jack Black (as usual) plays an insufferable, juvenile, overbearing, arrogant, hyperactive nuisance.",1,17,40,29 April 2017
