The Ring," confusing movie!
","I've read some of the comments, which cleared up a couple of things for me, but I still am a bit confused about it.  Someone commented about the 'maggots'...those weren't maggots...if you look closely, those were PEOPLE squirming around..maybe all of the people she's trapped/caught with the tape?!?  Samaras parents:  you meet the father, who kills himself, in modern times obviously, but then why, when you see the mother, is she dressed as if she's living in the late 1800's/early 1900's?  Is this just a glitch?",Null,0,0,8 December 2002
