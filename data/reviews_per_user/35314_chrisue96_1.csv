The Sound of Music," A feel good and mushy movie
","One of my favourite things for sure. The Sound of Music has an excellent cast of annoying and funny children - as kids would be at that age - all 7 of them. I love Julie Andrews in this one, not only for her singing but also for her portrayal of the motherly Maria Von Trapp.Of course this is a timeless classic which all homes should have.. especially if you have kids. I remember my mum sitting me down in front of it when I was 3. I've watched it so many times I can write the script.
The narrative is quite simple but the film's cast, the music, and the scenery of Salzburg make it extra special, albeit the backdrop of the movie is the Anchlus before (and soon after) the Nazis take over Austria. There is something in it for all the family - fun, music, romance and even a little villainry.A slight warning though, if you're not in the mood for sugary sweet lovey dovey stuff with music on top - don't bother with this one.
Also, the movie is only loosely based on the Maria Von Trapp story - besides the name of the Captain, Maria and some of the places, all others are fictional - characters like Uncle Max and Baroness Shroeder didn't exist in real life. To have a clearer picture of how the Von Trapps lived their lives through this period, read Maria's (not Julie Andrews') book.",9,1,7,1 November 2003
