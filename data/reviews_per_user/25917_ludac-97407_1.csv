Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Boring movie
","As someone who loves SF movies this saga was a must watch for me. I have already watched the old trilogy and apart from the stunning visual effects for that time i could not say that the first three movies were spectacular when it comes to story telling. I respect that Lucas created almost all from nothing, but when you watch the movies without the hype you can see that there are a lot of flaws.This movie is no exception. It is forced completely, mainly because we know what is going to happen latter, but it could have gone out far more believable. Everything seems bland, forced and without any emotion.And if you want special effects, well, just watch The Matrix(it was made in the same year).",4,1,8,18 December 2015
