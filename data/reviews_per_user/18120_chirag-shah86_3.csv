Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," VERY bad...Not believable...
","This movie made no sense...THeir is no such thing as pirates! Also their is no such thing as mermaids and how can water make you live forever? Such a fake move, only affects and 3d was OK, rest boring and stupid...Also Penelope is sexy and the sword fight sequences were fun to watch but no logic... Whoever came up with a story like this is from another world and needs to understand reality. How can a man get stabbed and not get killed? How can a man simply pick up his sword and create magic like that? Also those mermaids were all wrong...I mean I have heard in other stories that mermaids (even though they don't actually exists) are peaceful and loving... In this movie they are shown as being evil which is completely ridiculous... Doesn't make any sense... Also the background score was repetitive and Johnny Depp has a lot of wrinkles on his face...He looks old...Plus Al Pacino needs to get a new job cuz he looks like a monkey..Overall I wouldn't recommend this film...Even the first film sucked because there is no such thing as pirates and no logic! Stupid movie...",4,0,3,1 June 2011
Source Code," STUPID! What was the point of this FILM??
","Why do we want to think when we watch a film? It was too confusing and I didn't understand what is happening...Why did this film release in India also I don't get it. The screenplay was stupid with the same sequence being shown over and over again... That is not what we paid for to see...We want entertainment here in India, not such 'intellectual' films...Most people in India won't understand a film like this! Hollywood always tries to confuse the viewers and all with their movies....Basically it just wasn't entertaining and I kept falling asleep... There wasn't any masala or singing/dancing either! What kind of a film is this? The girl was good looking but that's the only positive thing about this boring film",Null,1,5,30 April 2011
