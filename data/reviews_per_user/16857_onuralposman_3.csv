Scarface," ScarBrace Yourselves
","With an extremely star-studded cast, Brian DePalma, a director who isn't unfamiliar to films associated with organised crime, crafts a magical feature in which Al Pacino really thrives in the role of Antonio 'Tony' Montana. With a very hard-hitting plot and an immaculate supporting team, this film can't go wrong. However, this film doesn't hit the bar of perfect due to it's excessive, overexaggerated violence.",9,0,0,3 April 2020
Mission: Impossible II," Mission OverImpossible
","Ethan Hunt returns to the phenomenal Mission Impossible franchise in its second outing, Mission: Impossible II. With an interesting romantic plot and improved Special Effects, this film can't be missed, especially if you're a fan of the first. However, many action sequences are overexaggerated, even if they're meant to be 'impossible'.",8,0,1,2 April 2020
The Great Escape," The Unfortunate Escape
","With an immensely powerful cast, this classic war-story is filled with laughs, emotion and digging. A simple story about an actual event which is action-packed, this film is truly remarkable, and one of the best war pictures of the last century. However, at times, the story is all over the place, making it slightly unfulfilling.",9,1,1,11 April 2020
