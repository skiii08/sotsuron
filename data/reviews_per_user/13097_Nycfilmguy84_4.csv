Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," The Funniest Movie of 2006.......by far
","The Funniest movie I've seen this year by far and I've seen a lot of movies. Sascha Baron Cohen as Ali G, Bruno and especially Borat is the funniest man alive. I thought he was also pretty fun as the French race car driver in Talladega Nights.Borat is neither anti-semitic or anti-American. It's a hysterical movie that makes jokes about everybody and everything: foreigners, blacks, Americans, politicians / the war, Jew's.Sascha Baron Cohen is a lock to receive a Golden Globe nomination and would not be too surprised if he wins the Golden Globe in the Comedy / Musical category the historically weaker category at the award show.<ul><li>The East Coast Cinema-fanatic</li></ul>",9,2,9,9 November 2006
Marie Antoinette," An Underrated Performance
","Kirsten Dunst's performance is underrated. Her best performance in years.Marie Antoinette is the non-classical, pop culture period costume drama. The risky decision by Coppola to omit the two big historical scenes from the film. If you keep in mind that she consistently makes the film non-classical. In a classical period piece you will see: 1) the storming of Versailles and 2) Queen Marie Antoinette's beheading.While a majority of critics did not like Marie Antoinette I refuse to be too harsh with it. It is neither: one of the 10 best films of the year or one of the worst. A good performance by Dunst, unlike anything in the genre that came before. The poor box office for Marie Antoinette eliminates any serious Oscar contention (if it deserves it or not).A shoo-in for: Costume Design and Art Direction Possible Nominations: Makeup, Cinematography",7,2,5,9 November 2006
Saw III," Saw 3, Worst Installment of the Saw Franchise
","Personally I think Saw 3 is mediocre and the definitely the worst of the 3 films. The suspense, intrigue and mystery the first two films is missing in the third film. And the visual creativeness that Bousman brought to the first sequel is also unapparent.The film is rushed, the writing is lazy and uncreative. Instead of doing these films every year and turning them out quickly take a year off. Work on the script longer possibly 6 months fine tune it and release Saw IV Halloween, 2008. Skipping a year is not going to diminish the popularity of the franchise. A weak installment like Saw 3 does diminish its popularity. Saw 3 is poised to gross even more than Saw 2 and will be the 2nd highest grossing horror of all time next to The Sixth Sense. A bigger box office total will rescue the weak Saw 3 from taking a hit in popularity but why is it essential to turn these out every year. Every other year is more than enough. Horror fans will never go away. The Western and musicals are long dead. Pure sci-fi is rarely produced but the popularity of horrors never wanes.",5,2,5,28 October 2006
The Fountain," No wonder 'The Fountain' was boo'd at Cannes
","The biggest disappointment of 2006. It is no surprise that Brad Pitt had creative differences with Aronofsky and left the film. A very good idea by Mr. Pitt.Ambition is a trait I rarely ever fault a filmmaker for having but the case is true here. Aronofsky was too ambitious. Visually the film is sensational and the unique vis. effects that Aronofsky used were stunning.The hammed up performances by Weisz and Jackman (two actors I like). A prime example of overacting. Was there any need for Ellen Burstyn's character in the movie.Aronofsky has a great eye for the camera otherwise poorly directed, poorly acted and incredibly and astonishingly horribly written.A FLOP. IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE FOUNTAIN YET AND ARE THINKING OF DOING SO SAVE YOUR $10 AND GO SEE ANYTHING ELSE.",3,5,11,3 December 2006
