Conquest 1453," Not a bad movie
","Since it's one of the first historical epic movies from Turkey, I wasn't expecting much. However, if you choose to look away from cheap CG, the story telling is not bad at all. The movie had plenty of cool elements and decent acting. My only other complaint besides cheap CG is the soundtrack. It's slightly clich√©. They should've incorporated eastern, Turkish motives to the soundtracks to make it more authentic. Of course, certain groups of people will dislike this movie and rate it poorly. The movie somewhat sticks to historical facts, but this can never truly accurate as history is written by winners and it's subjective in its nature.",6,4,8,2 October 2012
