The Devil's Advocate," Best Hollywood movie of the 90`s
","Devils Advocate is probably the best Hollywood movie of the 90`s, and surely the best Hackford`s film. The plot is fantastic and the cast is great. Keanu Reeves maybe doesn`t seem like the first choice for the role of the young and hungry attorney, Lomax, but he carries the part like few actors would. Al Pacino is excellent as ever, but the best part in my opinion is Lomax`s half sister.",10,14,24,10 February 2000
Match Point," A cross between Crimes and Misdemeanors' and Interiors'
","This is a fine film by legendary artist, who in his 70's is still scoring high on the familiar ground of multi-angled relationships, adultery, betrayal and murder you can get away with. As in Crimes and Misdemeanors', one of his greatest films, the leading character cheats and murders but as long as he can live with his wrong doings and settles the score with his conscience, he gets away with a crime he should be punished for. That is a second film apart from Crimes and Misdemeanors', where Allen explores the bottom of human conscience and rewards his hero with a pass to a life where it doesn't have implications on his life after the committed crime. Same as in Interiors' human relationships among leading characters are superficial enough to make an escape for a Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) that much easier, but than again, many people would do literally anything to erase their mistakes and protect the comfort of their lives.Among the majority of shallow, moronic cinema of today, a remaining light of one of the last great Directors (with capital D) that is Mr. Allen, shines even brighter to show that there are still great movies which are made for audiences above the adolescence. A 9 out of 10.",9,0,1,20 September 2007
A Bridge Too Far," An example in the history of WWII cinema
","This is one of the best war movies ever made. I've seen it first as a kid, in a movie theater, and I was impressed. Seven or eight years later, I saw it again on TV, taped it and was equally impressed. A short while ago I bought a DVD, special edition, of this movie and my impression still holds after all these years. This is a great film, it packs so much action, humor, wit and beautiful performances by equally great actors, and directing is superb. In those days it took a lot of hard work and skill to portray the operation 'Market Garden' which was the biggest airborne assault to this day. The film was made before CGI and all other computer wizardry, and if you compare it to 'Saving Private Ryan', it looks a bit dated lake an old car, compared to the new one, but when that car was made using superior workmanship, it can always stand equal to anything new.The one thing this film has plenty and 'Saving private Ryan' does not, is a lot of charm and beautiful witty dialog. The scene in which Christopher Good (Maj. Carlyle), explains to Anthony Hopkins (Gen. Frost), why he is always carrying an umbrella, even into the battle, is a pure example of how this movie works throughout it's course to the downbeat but true finale. It would be hard and space consuming to list all the fine work from all the top actors, and the only thing missing in this picture, in my opinion, is casting of Steve McQueen, who sadly declined an offer of to participate, because he didn't want to appear in an 'all star' movie. If he was in, 'A Bridge too far' would be absolutely superb. But in any case this film can stand a test of time any day, and I give it 9 out of 10, easy!",9,2,4,15 December 2006
No Country for Old Men," One of the weakest among brilliant Coen films
","I'm an absolute fan of the Coen brothers, and think that they represent one of the most imaginative and artistically different movie-making partnerships in the recent decades. The true brilliance of 'The big Lebowski', 'Barton Fink', 'Fargo', 'Miller's crossing' or their debut 'Blood simple', shows the way to creativity without compromise. On their latest effort 'No country for old man' I think they lost that path, the same way as with the misfired 'Raising Arizona', and compromises with the film industry, which brought them Oscar nominations and subsequent Best picture award, are sadly evident in this film. The Coen seal is there but it's broken in several places and that ruined the originality of their trade mark approach.To begin with everything that is wrong with this film, I have to point out, first and foremost, the gaping plot holes that brought the entire story down. Forget the convenient randomness of Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), entering the town of all places, just by the motel where Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) is hiding the money, so his transponder can start beeping, the movie holds pretty well up to the point where Moss figures why he is being pinpointed each time by Chigurh, and from that point spirals straight down.First we can't figure why Moss doesn't destroy the transmitter once he realized that this is the reason why he is always found by Chigurh, and especially when he realizes that Chigurh is in the hotel, and that he can pin point the room where Moss is hiding, by following the signal. OK, maybe Moss wants to be found, and have a show down with his pursuer, but than why does he sit right in front of the door, the killer is going to enter, especially knowing that Chigurh turned the hallway lights off. Maybe to have a better shot at him - not likely, and even than, as Moss shoots through the door Chigurh is supposedly standing in front of, just as he blew away the lock with his cattle gun, Chigurh escapes unharmed and is wounded later on in the street. Also, the Woody Harrelson character Carson Wells, is totally undeveloped and surplus in the film. Earlier in the movie we see that he is supposed to be some kind of a specialist in handling extremely dangerous nut jobs like Chigurh, and is paid accordingly, but Chigurgh killed him just as easily as the old man driving the car, at the beginning of the movie!? Than it's never explained how does Wells, find Moss in the Mexican hospital? What tricks and abilities did he use for such intelligence work, being later on, came up behind and shoot as an unsuspecting bozo by Chigurh? Also, back at the high-rise building of the businessman who hired Wells, Chigurh bursts in to find the businessman talking to someone from 'accounting' and shoots the businessman in the face. How in the world did he, pass through the entire building with cattle gun along with the gas tank and a shotgun? Nobody bothered to show us.But the film really falls apart at the denouement point where we expect a show down between Moss and Chigurh, at the end, where Moss is supposed to send away his wife with the money so he'll be able to freely track Chigurh down. After the scene where Moss is talking to a girl by the pool, it appears like a significant part is cut away from the movie with several key scenes missing! Next, we see sheriff Bell driving along and seeing Mexicans getting out of the motel, Moss being shot,and we don't have a first clue what happened and how? Mexicans supposedly found Moss through his mother in law, but than again, how did they know where to wait for Moss's wife and her mother? How does Chigurh appear in a motel room where Moss have been shoot, and why doesn't he kill sheriff Bell, he's killing everybody else, so why not him? And at the last point where the film might have been partially redeemed, the point where Chigurh gets hit by another car, passing through the intersection, and where he should have been killed by an act of strange, absurd chance, that would bring a twist to the end of this film, he walks away to emptiness from which he came in at the beginning. So that summons it up, lots of empty spaces, (including a pointless Tommy Lee Jones monologue at the very end), in a movie that might have been great if the Coens didn't look for industry seal of approval, and the lack of the same gave their previous films so much charm. 4/10",4,12,19,26 February 2008
JFK," This is how it happened
","JFK is the best political assassination conspiracy thriller ever made! It's a visually striking, documentary like movie with heart-throbbing pace, and bravura acting with story based on nothing but hard facts. It was striking that polls conducted from 1966 on show that as many as 80% of the American public hold beliefs contrary to the findings of the Warren commission. And how could anybody believe the report that invented a 'magic bullet' theory which supposed to explain how a mixed up character like Lee Harvey Oswald, could have managed to shoot both the president and governor Connally six times, including a fatal frontal shot to John F. Kennedy's head, clearly visible in Zapruder film, firing only three times in 5.6 seconds from up behind the motorcade. The facts of the case show that there had to be another gunman, and if so than we have a conspiracy, and everything that happened later both to principal characters, witnesses and shift in foreign and domestic American politics, only give proof to that conclusion. Oliver Stone waste no time in presenting the case. I've never seen a movie 197 minutes long, that doesn't let your mind wonder for a second. People who testify to various aspects of the assassination are moving in front of your eyes like passing trains and every one of them puts another piece in never completed puzzle of conspiracy behind the Kennedy assassination. This film, along with 'Executive action', filmed only 10 years after, in 1973, show that the plot to kill John Kennedy is worked out and organized in a way that there's no doubt that it leads to the highest ranking government officials and all the industrial and banking tycoons that had everything to loose with JFK's policy of non involvement, racial equality and dÃ©tente with the USSR. Later assassinations of Martin Luther King, and Robert Kennedy, show that this pattern was used in a same manner, to eliminate most dangerous political threats to the 'big money' and conservative politics. Like Donald Sutherland's 'X' has said in the movie 'Who benefited? Who has the power to cover it up?', these are the questions Stone's film is trying and in my opinion succeeding in giving good answers to. More than recommended, a must see.",Null,9,29,27 June 2009
The Bridge on the River Kwai," Unrealistic Hollywood style cartoon
","I have a deep admiration for David Lean as the director who pushed the boundaries of film making far beyond, and set the marker not only in technical aspects of the craft, but often in atmosphere and feel of the film. His movies are beautiful to watch and that's why sometimes we can't see how bad the cake tastes from all the icing and decorations. 'The Bridge on the River Kwai' is like that, sticky sweet but ultimately nauseating. Every time a movie parts from reality we observe a genre, and the intention of film maker, along with symbolism it's trying to project. War movies in particular have to be true to the bone (unless they're parodies) because they represent the bestiality of mankind, and duality of man. This film tried to portray those essential elements but fell into Hollywood blender and came out silly and unrealistic.First and foremost, anybody who even remotely knows anything about Japanese tradition, military culture social and military codes and character of Japanese man, can only laugh at pitiful Colonel Saito who is not only without any remorselessness, but looks like a powerless teacher on the first day in a new school, being played like a flute by honorable Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness),who not only survives days, locked in a tin box in tropical heat and humidity, but wins every concession for his troops he can think of, making the poor Colonel Saito cry at the end of one of his parades of will?!? Japanese soldiers and camp commanders were 'very well known' for their compassion, sensitivity and sensibility which was expressed many times during the war, especially in Wake Island massacre, Manila massacre and Bataan Death March, so even the hint of Colonel Nicholson's behavior would result in quick decapitation. William Holden with his tanned biceps glowing in the sun is a true picture of starved Japanese prisoner, and his escape, along with return through the jungle in 50's style loafers (observe the scene where he and his band of sturdy man are being washed by Burmese women prior to attacking the bridge), is down right preposterous. Building a bridge as a monument to his ego is possible way of expression for 'open only in a case of war' type of character Col. Nicholson apparently is, but convincing other prisoners to join in that venture simply on 'let's show 'em' premise, in those times and circumstances is not likely to happen. To complete the three-ring circus, Japanese soldiers show solidarity and play along, so at the end you're not sure what did you just see. The battle of wills, winner makes history film, anti-war film, or simply a Hollywood action movie/spectacle without any plausibility or logic? Judge for yourself. Oh, and 5 stars are only for cinematography and Holden's loafers.",5,16,28,31 August 2010
Inside Llewyn Davis," The Times They Are a-Changin'
","Beautiful story of poetic soul trapped in time before his time, an antiquated, band-lead world of the early 1960's music scene. Rich in Coen symbolism, Inside Llewyn Davis portrays an every talented man, unadjusted to society that doesn't appreciate his obsolete poetry, soon to become world wide trend for the next decade and a half. Nothing he tries seems to work and all his endeavors turn to dust.But Llewyn fights on, led through stormy seas of his life by destiny that he desperately tries to hold on to, loosing a grip on it whenever he looses the cat, his mystery companion.He gets a beating from his bad luck, in the alley behind the Gaslight Cafe, posing as his 'friend', after the performance where he takes a pity on himself singing 'Hang Me, Oh Hang Me' from depth of his troubled mind. Every person he meets is another piece in the jigsaw of his redemption waiting to happen. As the cycle of his downfall makes a full circle, he is back where we found him, but something has changed. Slim silhouette with a slightly husky voice, takes the stage and opens a new era in popular music, making 'never new', and 'never old music', the voice of a generation. Llewyn says 'Au revoir' to shadowy ugly figure of his bad luck, that speeds away from him, in a yellow cab. The Times They Are a-Changin' and his destiny has led him out of the tempest of life, that had kicked him around.Certainly one of the best films in the Coen canon, Inside Llewyn Davis will always let you find a new layer on it. It will make you laugh it will give you hope, and the music is beautiful and moving, with unsurpassed performance of 'Please Mr. Kennedy' shining through. Worth of repeated viewings.",9,0,0,13 March 2014
