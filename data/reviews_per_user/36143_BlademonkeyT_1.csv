Requiem for a Dream," Genius
","Requiem for a Dream was an incredibly amazing powerful piece of art.  Its very hard for a movie to get a distinctive emotional reaction for the reason that I am very critical of movies, but after watching this I was almost in tears.  Every thing about it was done well. The acting was superb and the use of different camera techniques and music brought everything together.",10,0,1,24 December 2001
