Walk the Line," Not your average biopic
","I had no expectations for this movie; I hadn't seen the ads or heard the buzz. I wanted to go to the movies, had the choice between Pink Panther and Walk The Line, and having seen the Pink Panther ads, I picked this one. I went in expecting another biopic: OK to watch once, not remarkable in any way, just a quick fast-forward through the biggest moments of Johnny Cash's career. I was wrong.The focus on Johnny and June is what makes this movie so compelling. It serves as a filter: every detail about Johnny's career doesn't have be shown, we don't have to follow his life until he dies, and so forth. Instead, we can focus on the topic of Johnny and June, and the movie has a story with a structure and a happy ending. It also serves to make this movie more intimate than most biopics: we see Johnny's personal life, not only in short clips, but as a continuing theme throughout. It makes him more human. Stellar performances from both lead actors, particularly Reese Witherspoon, who portrays June's compelling personality very well. The chemistry between the two lead actors is great.The childhood scenes also worked. In most biopics, these are very short and seem like gratuitous foreshadowing of the star's later career (see the otherwise brilliant Man on the Moon, for example). Here that was avoided by focusing on the brother's tragic death. That and the father's attitude served to explain Cash's problems later in life, and they weren't overdone. The death was touching, but not too dramatized; it seemed fairly realistic. We got to see just enough of Jack and the family dynamics to understand how devastating his death would be for the others.The only thing I wanted to see more of was the courtship between Johnny and Viv; there never seemed to be any chemistry between them, as all we saw were their marital problems. It would have been nice to know why Johnny fell in love with her and what made them get married. It would have humanized Viv a bit; as it is, she comes off as a rather demanding woman who doesn't understand Johnny's devotion to music. I'm not saying she had no reason to complain, but this aspect was overdone in my opinion.The music scenes worked well to set the tone and serve as transitions throughout the movie. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon shine on stage and their chemistry is especially good in these scenes.All in all, this is one of the best biopics I've ever seen. Highly recommended.",9,3,5,27 March 2006
Scary Movie 2," Could it get any worse than this?
","I liked the first Scary Movie. Yes, it had silly and gross jokes at times and the parodies weren't as sharp as they could have been. But it WAS funny and it had parodies. This sequel started out about the same, but soon the parodies were dropped to make way for the Wayans brothers' running gags, the same as in the first movie. These are: 1. Gays. Gay guys are all nymphomaniacs, so watch out straight guys! Don't befriend a gay guy, he's sure to fall in love with you and/or molest you. And the doll rape scene? Not funny, just gross. 2. Handicapped people. In the first movie there was Dewey, the mentally retarded guy, whose only redeeming moment was when he turned out to be the killer who had only been faking retarded the whole time. In this movie there's Dwight, a wheelchair-bound guy who's obsessed with never asking for help. I don't think I get the joke there. We're also introduced to Hanson (played disgustingly by Chris Elliott), who has a withered hand and - well, that's it. He's gross! I mean, a withered hand, no need for a personality or anything. Just like Goldmember on Austin Powers, he's just gross for the sake of gross, and therefore not funny.3. Bodily fluids. We got to see them all in this one, and when there's a pee scene, a fart scene and a vomit scene within the first minutes, you're in trouble. The sperm explosion joke from the first movie was repeated. These are surely funny moments to some viewers, but to others like me it's just cringeworthy and disturbing.4. Sex. This can't be avoided in a teen comedy, but it was supposed to be a parody of scary movies and not all about sex. I agree with the poster who said the Wayans brothers should just make a porn movie. They seem obsessed with sex.5. Drugs. Shorty's back and still not doing anything but smoking pot. It gets really tired after a while. I did laugh when the plant rolls a joint with him inside, but other than that, it wasn't funny at all.The only part that works is the Exorcist spoof in the beginning, but even that is ruined with crap, pee and vomit jokes. Notably, this part is the only one without the main characters present. As for the roles, Anna Faris does her best, but her role is pretty much being a stupid pretty girl. Kathleen Robertson gets to play the sex bomb and Tori Spelling is the 'athletic' girl who has sex with the ghost, and who dies pretty soon. Both are pretty underutilized and aren't even present in most scenes. The new addition, besides Hanson and Dwight, is a parrot saying dirty/rude things, which is pretty predictable and boring.All in all, a very disappointing sequel. Not worth watching. 1/10.",1,7,15,29 April 2006
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," A breath-taking chase through the subconscious
","-SPOILERS-This is a brilliant movie. The uniqueness of the plot surpasses even Being John Malkovich, which was my favourite movie before this. Everything falls into place: writing, editing, casting, music. The only thing that disturbed me was the ending, because I felt it was resolved a little too quickly. However, this is possibly the best stuff I've ever seen from Kaufman, and great work from Winslet and Carrey. There are many different ways of making a movie like this(I could imagine the writers trying different strategies before coming up with this one). The timeline is very important. The true brilliance of the movie is in the time sequence. It can be very confusing at first, but it's also very intriguing.There are many scenes where you are led to expect a more chronological narrative. In the beginning of the movie, when Joel and Clementine meet, you are fooled to thinking it's the first time they meet. Cue the opening credits and their breakup. When Joel is at the doctor's office, he starts talking about the first time they met; we see a film rolling, showing the party where it happened. You might expect to see their whole relationship in flashbacks with Joel as the narrator, but the flashback is cut off and we're back in the story. What you then see is their whole relationship in flashbacks, but in a REVERSED order, with Joel being aware of the procedure and trying to change the chain of events. He isn't narrating old events to the viewers, he is reliving them and trying to hold on to the memories as they are disappearing before his eyes. The result is a breath-taking chase through Joel's subconscious - somewhat similar to the one in Being John Malkovich, but more deep. At the same time, we see the 'erasers' working at Joel's apartment and their relationship with each other, which also becomes somewhat surprising. The movie deals with a lot of deep issues. For example, how love turns into hate; how the memory works; how you have to erase a person from your life totally when you break up, and a big part of yourself too. In the end, Joel and Clementine decide to fall in love all over again, despite the problems they had. It can be seen as a statement: even if love isn't easy, it's always worth living. 10/10.",10,0,2,16 September 2004
Love Actually," Fragmented, unfunny movie
","<ul><li>Spoilers, in case anyone really cares-</li></ul>This movie is best characterized by the last scene: 100 tiny pictures of ppl hugging each other. That's just about what it was all along. A bunch of couples falling in and out of love, some of the stories very loosely related. Fragmented, difficult to follow, and none of the storylines were carried out properly. I suppose this happens when they have too many famous actors and actresses that all need a role in there somewhere. Rowan Atkinson, for example, got only one funny scene, although he's on the promo posters. They could have done so much more with him.Somehow the film doesn't fit the genre. It's not really funny, and a romantic comedy should have 'happy endings' for everyone. What happened with Keira Knightley and her husband's best friend? Did they fall in love now? So she'll leave her husband, well merry Christmas to you too. And Emma Thompson cheated on and Laura Linney stuck with an insane brother and losing the guy - not my idea of a feel-good movie.As for the humor, it was really almost nonexistent. There were a few 'cute' scenes, and I laughed heartily at Bill Nighy once or twice, but it seems the writers didn't even really try to make it funny. The jokes were predictable, forced and sometimes just plain weird (like the little girls wanting to hear Christmas carols - huh?) There was only one big laugh in the theatre during the whole movie. Didn't feel like watching a comedy. Bill Nighy as the aging rock star and Colin Firth with his Portuguese girl were funny at first, but both stories were watered down by the end. The 'fat sister' thing was so predictable. They even hinted at it in the beginning of the movie!
Speaking of which, what's with all the fat jokes?  They're ok in Bridget Jones, but here we have a normal weight girl being called 'plump', and Emma Thompson comparing herself to Pavarotti?! Way to promote a healthy body image. Not to mention the characters who actually were fat. I wonder if the writers have weight issues?Hugh Grant was, as usual, charming, but his storyline wasn't as central as I had hoped. Also, they shouldn't have brought in the politics between USA and GB. I get the Monica Lewinsky joke ('plump' girl kissed by US president), but it just didn't fit the movie.And the appalling storyline about the little boy who falls in love? 11-year-old boys do NOT fall in love. And he just lost his mother but is much sadder about a girl not noticing him? Maybe if he were 15, and the mother had died a year ago, or something. I couldn't believe the airport scene. It's even older than 'fat sister' or 'friends are more important than success'. Too many clichés for one movie.I mostly went to see this movie for Hugh Grant, so I didn't expect too much, but I was still disappointed. This movie was just too shoddily done to really touch me in any way. 5 out of 10 points (3 for Hugh Grant&Emma Thompson, 2 for the content).",5,7,12,22 November 2003
