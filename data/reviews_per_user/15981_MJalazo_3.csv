The Avengers," Effortlessly ties together various story arcs, with great action and plenty of laugh-out-loud moments
","I've never been a comic book geek but have seen all the Marvel movies thus far (the sole exception being Iron Man 2) and have loved them all. Until now, Thor was my favorite, simply because I was a huge fan of the otherworldly cinematography, the Shakespearean dialogue and characters, and because I found Tom Hiddleston's Loki to be the most captivating villain in any superhero movie to date. So, perhaps just as much as seeing The Avengers come together, I was equally stoked to see Loki again as the arch-nemesis. Simply put, he was fantastic. There is a scene when he confronts Black Widow, about halfway through the film, that is nothing short of haunting and allows him to show his full range of talents. He's brilliant.As far as The Avengers themselves... Joss Whedon does two things very well here. First, he allows each character ample time to harness and exhibit its individual conflicts, and how they would play out among the team. After all, putting four superheroes in a room and asking them to play nicely should be no easy task, given the massive egos you would expect to be involved. Whedon plays this collective angst out very nicely. Second, he ties all the story lines from the individual movies together, in a near seamless fashion. Amazingly, everything made a good deal of sense as it came together, with no major storyline flaws. Quite the accomplishment, given the diversity of many of the stories told in each film.Robert Downey is great, capturing the cynicism and narcissism of Tony Stark better than he did in the original. Captain America and Thor bring unexpected humanity to their roles. Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk was quite the surprise, as he does what Eric Bana and Edward Norton failed to do, and that is underplay Banner (rather than portray him as a neurotic, hyper fool). The best Hulk yet. Scarlett Johannsen does a very nice job as Black Widow, also conveying deep emotion and pain.Probably the best dynamic is between Stark and Banner... two intellectual geeks who form quite a bond that is believable.Lastly, I saw it in IMAX and that probably added an extra point to my 9/10 rating, as seeing it in a less profound format wouldn't quite capture everything that is on display here. All in all, definitely worth seeing and I'll be back in the theatre again before it's on DVD, which will certainly be in my collection.",9,1,4,4 May 2012
The Incredible Hulk," A worthy comic book adaptation... just leave your memories of the TV show at the door
","First off, like many others here, I am a huge Hulk fan, and am prone to minimize what's wrong with this movie (I'm putting that bias up front, so people can judge my comments more objectively). Second, I loved the television series, and had much less exposure to the comics, but am familiar with the comic book adaptation enough to draw some basic comparisons.I went into this movie with very high expectations that it would rival or exceed the dramatic flair of the television series. This was a big mistake. Why? Well, the television series was an adaptation of the comic. Plus, it was filmed in the late seventies, when CGI didn't exist, budgets were limited, and stories were simpler in their formulation and execution. With these constraints, it made perfect sense for the series to focus on the dramatic internal struggle of Bill Bixby. He usually had forty minutes of every hour to do this, prior to his two 'Hulk-Outs.' The Hulk itself, as a human, could only destroy so much.As a fan of the comic, though, where the only limits are set by the reader's imagination, the Hulk story was very different. The comic-book Hulk was boundless, larger than life, relentless in its destruction, and occasionally evil. So, if you're going to make a movie with a $130 million dollar budget, by a studio with comic-book origins, it's natural that the movie should be an overblown feast for the eyes.This movie will give you that, and more. The CGI Hulk is magnificent in its destruction. I very much felt like I was watching the ape from the recent King Kong, both in terms of its nuances and overall movement patterns. I wouldn't be surprised if some of the same architects were behind both. The violence is strong and occasionally unsettling, but very much in keeping with the Hulk from the comics. General Ross, played by William Hurt, is a great adversary, as is the Abomination. I wasn't too keen on Tim Roth as Emil Blonsky, for although he did an adequate job, he's too short and not a worthy foe. If they wanted a credible foreign villain who was physically imposing, I would have much preferred to see the new James Bond in this role. The origin of the character of the Leader is cleverly done, and the actor who played him did a nice job.As for one of the fundamental elements, how does Edward Norton do? Again, trying to leave my bias for the TV show aside, he does well. He captures the pain of being a loner well, but I felt there wasn't enough conviction to his anger, and he doesn't sell that emotion well. The leadups to the Hulk-outs felt somewhat rushed, as were the Hulkouts themselves. But once we see the Hulk... wow.In sum, if you're a fan of the comics and just want to see visceral rage and all-out destruction, this is a very good movie. 8.5 out of 10. If you're more a fan of the series and want a serious amount of drama so you care more both for Banner and the Hulk's plight, this movie was okay but somewhat lacking in this area. 7 out of 10.Rumor has it that Norton wanted a movie that was thirty minutes longer and more dramatic. Had he gotten his wish, I think Marvel would have had a blockbuster on their hands, well better than Iron Man, which I also liked. I'll see what the extended version DVD brings... even if it's more dramatic, though, I'll hope for the rumored deleted scene involving a standoff between Hulk and polar bears, as the action never gets old.Hulk Smash!!!",8,1,4,14 June 2008
The Cabin in the Woods," Stunningly original and fiendishly clever, 'Cabin' is a movie for the ages
","This is one of those movies that you will enjoy far more, the less you know about it. So, with that said, you'll get no spoilers here. I would also strongly encourage you not to read any.Often times, I find that a movie that tries too hard to be all things, to all people, ends up being nothing to anyone. Yet, this is a piece of film that succeeds immensely as a horror film, suspense story, and dark comedy, more so than any other movie that I can ever recall seeing. I don't understand how a movie can be so serious, so enthralling... and yet not take itself too seriously and be campy fun all at the same time. But these filmmakers did it.I loved this movie so much, that I am going back a second time today to see it, after convincing my friend to join me. I do not exaggerate when I say that this film will revolutionize the horror genre and go down in history as the most impactful film of its kind, since the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre decades ago. Go out of your way to see this brilliant work. You won't regret it.",10,5,16,13 April 2012
