War Dogs," a well made war comedy
","Todd Philips has done a fine job in creating a nice War Comedy. There haven't been many decent war comedies in the recent times.War dogs is about two young kids who exploit the not-so-good government initiative in becoming arms dealers, in the process getting greedy and in trouble. Based on a real life story of David Packouz and Efraim Diveroli, who won a $300 million contract from the Pentagon to arm America's allies in Afghanistan, the director has done a great job in converting a dry story into an entertaining movie.Jonah Hill keeps up the comedy of the film through out. Miles Teller, an under rated actor proves yet again that he can be a great actor in this one. Bradley Cooper's character is well crafted and is entertaining till the end. The supporting characters have done a decent job.This wouldn't be on top movies but sure is a fun watch in summer. my rating 7/10",7,4,10,16 August 2016
Ready Player One," A visually stunning adaptation without the soul of the book
","I don't have any problem with movie being different from the book. I would say this movie is based on the book and Ernest Cline who authored the book is the co-screenwriter for the movie. But the movie lacks to capture the drama and the bond between characters.Plus
Visually this one is a spielberg masterpiece. The race sequence was fantastic with great cinematography. The animation is flawless; the way the animated characters also blend in the real world is mindblowing. (or that's what $175 million could get you) Cons
The romance between the lead characters seemed forceful. Despite the actors doing a great job, I think it's some chopped up reel on the production house floor that may make us feel it is forced. Also, the movie does not even capture the emotion between our rebel team at least half as the book. It never explains how all the characters team up. It seemed rushed. Overall, while visually stunning, bad editing and poor character building fail to connect us with the emotions that our characters feel at certain points of the movie.It's a definite big screen watch.",7,0,2,29 March 2018
Suicide Squad," Fun movie to watch; DC's attempts to kind of mimic Marvel?
","I have watched this film 4 days ahead of its release at Regal Fenway, Boston (Thanks to Warner Brothers Invitation).This is a fast paced, comic and CGI filled movie. The character introduction is well done. Will Smith, Margot Robbie steal the show. The story is 'Assembling a bunch of bad guys against a super villain whose motive is to wipe off the earth'. (Story of Avengers 1, Avengers 2, Batman, etc). There is nothing new about the story, but the director David Ayer did a great job introducing the characters and building the story. Poor characterization, some poor dialogues and erratic screenplay are the side effects of a week story line. Except Deadshot, Harley Quinn and Diablo, the other characters seemed to be underdeveloped. The Good: - Jai courney as the Boomerang was a great comic relief and he reminds us of DCs attempts to include comedy in their apparent Dark and gritty films. - Diablo was fun to watch, though some things at the end of the movie regarding this character are un explained. - Great directing within the constrains of the story. - Fantastic lead by Will SmithThe Bad - Poor CGI - Villain(s) with poor motive - Viola Davis' poor characterization - Wrong timing for comedy. - You clearly see the audience and critics making an impact on the film. DC was blamed for being too dark unlike marvel and you can see the screen writers deliberately including funny one liners in un- necessary scenes.Overall, it is a great summer film. If you step into the movie hall with less or zero expectations (like me) you are going to have fun.Special mention about the Joker.Jared Leto: The method actor who underwent a lot of physical and mental training is put down as he gets less screen time to show his skills off. It was reported that Jared Leto shut himself from the world and completely transformed into the role of Joker. Will Smith also admitted he never got to know the real actor behind. That said, you will go to the movies to see all the talent unused and given less screen time.",7,17,43,2 August 2016
Interstellar," Interstellar = occurring or situated between stars
","The movie deserves to stay on top of the other space movies ever produced. It offers more that what you'd expect from Chris Nolan.Back-ground Score: Hans Zimmer does it again for Nolan. The music is building up and manages to control your hear beat and moist in your palm and eyes. I won't spoil for you, but try to describe the music when Cooper leaves Murph and when the space ship enters the worm hole and during the end will make you deaf to bad music.Kind of Movie: Space Adventure. If you are looking for space action, this might not be the movie for you. The movie has action scenes, but it's not wound around it. The first one hour of the film is very thick and establishes a rock solid basement for the next 2 hours of super fast visual ride. Apart from the space visuals obtained from the ship-cam, the sound effects and music are just in a good pace.Positives: - Acting - Every actor gave their best shot. Mackenzie Foy (Young Murph) in the first one hour of film did an amazing job in building up the relation with Matthew ( Cooper).You don't wanna talk about the good acting skills of Mathhew, Jessica Chastain,Casey Affleck,Matt Damon and Michael Caine (who stars in all Nolan's films) - Visual effects - carefully knit around the story, beautifully projected on screen. ( 3 best scenes. Can't spoil ) - Background score - 10/10 to Hans Zimmer - Screenplay and editing make the film more paced, making 2 hour 45 minutes feel like an hour.Negatives - Michael Caina and Mathhew's dialogues at times are not clearlyaudible. - Anne Hathaway could be a better cat woman than Amelia. Her expressions in the space ship are funny.",9,1,6,8 November 2014
Ex Machina," Contrived solution to an apparently insoluble difficulty
","NO SPOILERS UNTIL ADVERTISED I just completed watching this film after knowing the hype it created recently. This movie is not everyone's cup of tea. If you are reading this you either must be looking out for a good review or have come here to find some sort of closure after watching the ending. To begin with, the movie is well crafted. I am not criticizing it's snail pacing, as it builds up the tension and bass usage for background music tightens up the tension. Nathan (Oscar Issac) is responsible for holding the interest of the audience. Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) is just another clichÃ©' character and you find it difficult to root for him.This film totally caches on one aspect - What happens next? The current events offer almost nothing, but raise the same questions which were previously raised by many AI films. Questions like, if an AI is really an AI? Does an AI make decisions for itself solely? Is an AI anti-human? People who have a little idea on AI will know that an AI sure knows how to respond to people, make decisions, doesn't have its own conscience. Its primary purpose is to learn and evolve which is why it is even invented in first place. (If this still hurts your brain think of it this way- A code written to perform will do task A). Yes we have seen what happens in movies when our characters try playing God. Adam and Eve story puppeteer-ed by humans usually doesn't end well.Moving on to the plot, Caleb has so little to offer to Nathan. Nathan already knows the cunning nature of the AI, but Caleb just is another lab rat who helps Nathan in reinforcing Nathan's beliefs. And moving on to Ava, she is one of her kind (a better version actually ) designed to change the world as we know it and Caleb has to actually figure out if that thing is AI or not.Performances in this film are great. Oscar Issac truly runs the show. It is because of him the tension even exists, his cool brainiac attitude and dialogues with Caleb put you in a baffling seats as in, you don't know if you are supposed to hate him or get charmed. Ava is well played by Alicia, with much charm and simplicity. Domhnall Gleeson is underused and also we don't tend to like the charter in general because of his insecurity and also he wouldn't do what he is supposed to.SPOILERS BEGIN HERE To put the movie in a single line - A person(Nathan) who designed an AI (Awa) tests its authenticity by bringing a lab rat (Caleb) who terribly fails at his job meaning the AI actually worked.But such an expert (Nathan) - Could not program Issac Asimov's three laws into an AI - A robot can never kill a human. Since this is an AI, it did. - Could never instruct his employees properly. The helicopter pilot can't even wait for the Caleb.Ava - Could easily fix herself, train another robot, control the power of the place, but it cannot re-program the place and escape. - It can only kill the person with a knife, but it will not strangle Nathan by hitting in his balls or strangling him to find her freedom. I agree that no movie is without sins, but this movie disguises these sins and tries to sell it. The ending is absurd.(I apologize for spelling and grammar mistakes in my review) I hope you enjoyed the great moments of this film! Cheers!My Rating 6.8",Null,0,2,19 July 2015
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Visually magnum opus' feeble attempt in beating the LOTR's charm
","Just came out of Imax cinema, Hyderabad, India where the film released a week ahead of USA's schedule.I have watched LOTR numerous times just like many of the fans here. The Hobbit, that started as ambitious project fails to deliver what LOTR does, but that's fine with me as all the elements that a film need are done in right amounts.This movie starts off just where it left and is about the mentality of the dwarfs (mainly Thorin) and the Men, Orks, Elves and yes BILBO.Acting is the prime aspect of the movie. Every actor gave their hundred percent. Visual effects and the war scenes are marvelous.The only negative aspect I feel is the direction department. There was too much of experimentation with the screenplay. Peter Jackson tried hard to get the charm of Lord of the Rings to this movie, but in vain.Overall it's a super fun movie to watch, which transports you to a different world. A Definite watch for lovers and Haters!!!!Rating 7.8/10",8,1,5,13 December 2014
Incredibles 2," Best Pixar sequel - Worth the wait
","After attending the movie premier at an IMAX, we were awe-struck. The visuals, coloring, editing, music, animation and action sequences were all perfect. The family's chemistry is better than before with Jack-Jack also chipping in this time. Continuing where it left off last time was a nice move by the creative team that won't be affected by the aged voice actors. Edna's character is awesome though present for less time.While the critical reviews that mention the movie has weak villain, I can't agree with the argument completely as the movie's motive is more than showcasing a perfect villain; bringing the rich family drama together.Action scenes are top notch and make you glued to the screen; At times I forgot I was watching an animated movie. The lighting, sounds, camerawork around the scenes is perfect. The movie doesn't waste any time in focussing on unnecessary conversations or scenes and yet is the longest pixar movie of all time. Still, you feel it's not that long.The short film before the movie will definitely warm up your emotions before you begin to watch the movie.
Must watch movie of the season.",9,3,5,19 June 2018
Sully," Fabulous screenplay and intense acting and emotional
","I am one of the lucky few who had the opportunity to get an advance premier screening for Sully at AMC IMAX Somerville, Boston ten days prior to the release.This is easily the best movie of 2016. I have been following the Jan 15 controlled ditching incident of US Airways Flight 1549 case for a while. Everything about this case was covered on TV and the hearings are uploaded on YouTube. I have watched nearly 5 hours of the footage on YouTube and I was skeptical before the film whether if it offers us anything new.I was mind-blown; the movie is truly an untold story. The drama, action and intensity is all along. It left me and many audience in tears. It feels realistic in the IMAX edition with great sound effects surrounding you. The screenplay of this film is unique, Client Eastwood is an outstanding director has outdone himself with this gripping tale.Tom hanks has been the heart of the film. The acting was top notch. I am sure his meetings with Chesley SUllenberger must have contributed something in the acting department. Aaron Eckhart as Jeff Skiles also did a great job with his subtle humor and great screen presence. He makes you wanting more of the character.Coming back to the facts, Client Eastwood has left what we all know because of the footages shown in YouTube and the hearings. Overall, great performances, superb screenplay, neat editing and fabulous visual and audio effects make this film easily the best in 2016.Above all, this one has a heart!9/10",9,93,136,6 September 2016
