Sucker Punch," very good movie
","Sucker punch is a very good message movie cloaked in a scifi movie with hot girls. I will not spoil the plot I will just let you know that there is hardly any cussing, the violence is done in a non gory/ classy way. The movie is a very good movie for a teen with a positive message while it still being what movies were meant for entertainment. Just like his movie 300 which although gory and action heavy had good themes of self sacrifice and not taking the easy road this movie also has a positive message and is more teen friendly and if you are a parent I would not have a problem with my teen seeing this one.Hopefully it will do well so that more directors will make inventive movies like this one rather than cashing in on the lame comedies that for some reason always do well.Also the special effect and locations were amazing and the acting was pretty good. Great story that flowed well even though it had a reality and a fantasy it still made easy sense. Not like that mess of a movie inception. Suckerpuch had a director with a clear vision of what he wanted and I feel it flowed well on screen. First movie I've seen in a theater this year and even though good movies are rare anymore, it makes me appreciate them even more with all the lame ones pushed out each week.Kevin",Null,18,35,25 March 2011
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," great movie especially in 3d
","Hi, Just saw the pirates movie in 3d and I was pleasantly surprised.I thought the story was good and inventive like the past ones.I thought the special effects were very inventive and you just kind of watched the crazy actions scenes in awe.I thought johnny depp the young guy lead and the young woman lead were very good in their parts and johnny depp seemed just as into the role as in the other pirates. Quite a few funny scenes and jokes with him just like in the past.The movie was over 2hrs long and to me never seemed boring and it was probably my favorite 1st seeing of a pirates movie.I would recommend anyone who enjoyed the previous pirates to give it a chance and if you like 3d the 3d looked really good also.I don't really have any complaints about the movie and the last movie I saw in the theaters was the hobbit battle of the 5 armies. So I was very happy that this movie was not a let down and I am looking forward to them continuing the franchise.Kevin",10,5,11,2 June 2017
