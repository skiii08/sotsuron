The King's Speech," w w www ww wonderful....
","I am not King George VI, so I do not know how to deliver a great speech or say something beautiful. But if I have to describe this movie in one word it would have to be either Wonderful or Beautiful and you would agree with me after watching this movie. What makes this movie wonderful is masterclass direction and crisp editing. But this is only the half story the other half or I should say the better half is Colin Firth. Most of the actors would have done 'over acting' for the same role but Mr. Colin did it to the perfection and not for a single moment i felt that he was acting. He was genius in the role. The pain and helplessness in his eyes while delivering the words was there to see. What else i should say, i can go on and on. These two factors I highlighted were the main reasons of a beautiful movie but thats not all. All the cast of the movie did full justice to their roles and everyone behind the camera must get the credit too as they made it look so real. This is the type of movie why one must fall in love with cinema. Watch it to believe it.",9,1,2,20 September 2011
The Game," The Game is ON.
","I was hungry like anything when I started watching this movie and that was the only time I felt hungry. 2 hours and 3 minutes passed like you are playing your favorite GAME and could not concentrate anything else. If you think Micheal Douglas is an over rated actor then this movie is enough to prove you wrong. Sean Penn does full justice to his cameo. This is not a movie that leaves you with puzzles after watching unlike many mystery thrillers, instead it solves itself and relaxes your muscles after a rough ride. This is a movie with an engrossing script, excellent acting and flawless direction. If you have not watched this movie yet then PLAY it. You wont regret it all. Entertainment at its best. Now I can have my snacks and you go watch it. 8/10",8,32,41,11 September 2011
Inception," You either like it or you are having a dreamless sleep...
","This is not just a story telling, this is INCEPTION. Some may find it hard to digest but the fact is, this movie is all about planting an idea in the minds of viewers. This is exceptionally smart film-making. Some may argue about the vague ending and in fact Nolan deliberately left some puzzles unsolved and confusing but this film is lot more than that. I did not find this movie confusing and the ending is absolutely up to the mark. It is a complete film with absolute complete ending and a very beautiful message has been planted at the end, in a mysterious way which is the best part of the movie. Nolan is the one to watch and he is the most entertaining and improvising director of our age who is giving the film making a new dimension. Bravo.10/10",10,1,6,14 July 2011
