Requiem for a Dream," An awesome masterpiece.
","I saw this movie like, hum, 15 times, and i cant get bored of watching it again and again, every time I watch it I find something new, the last one was the in the last part, the detail of everyone sleeping in the fetal position, anyway this is a must watch movie, seriously.. It focus a lot of things in the past, present, and future of our world, shows how drugs are addictive and how they destroy you, and everything that is around you.. and shows that dreaming too high sometimes can be bad. I seriously recommend you guys to watch this movie, even if you hear bad things about it, don't care, see for your eyes one of the best movies ever made, take care.",10,3,6,14 January 2006
