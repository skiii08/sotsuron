Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Great Fun & Great Comedy, Hiding in a Mediocre Movie
","I agree with most of the posted reviews - this movie is hilarious! Sasha Cohen's portrayal of Borat, a prejudiced, ignorant but well meaning Khasakstanian reporter is brilliant. He never loses the character, dealing with every situation as if such an absurd character could be real.The strengths of the movie are the scenes where Borat's portrayed ignorance or prejudice combines with the hateful, stupid or ignorant reactions from the people he encounters. Sasha asks a gun dealer advice on a weapon 'good to kill a Jew' - the dealer suggests a 9mm. In another scene a rodeo cowboy agrees with Borat that homosexuals should be locked up and killed. Where Sasha brings out the ugly truth and combines it with his own comedy, he's at his best.The weak scenes are when Borat is with people who are open and accepting of him as a foreigner, tolerant of his failures and attempting to help him. One scene has a dinner party host trying to instruct Borat on the use of a toilet; in another a group of black youths instruct Borat on how to look and talk like them. These scenes are funny, but funny at the expense of people helping a stranger. In one scene an angry feminist walks away from Borat - Sasha's attempts to goad her having failed. Borat's lines are funny, but the scene doesn't really work.The movie is a series of independent scenes - each a new encounter for Sasha to showcase Borat's ignorance. While each scene is funny, as a whole there is no real progress - the end of the movie is no funnier for having watched the start. The plot happens, but really is included as a vehicle to change the locations of the scenes, not a means to evolve the characters.It's great comedy, but a mediocre movie.",3,2,5,4 November 2006
Cloverfield," This is a terrible movie
","Awful. Bad. Stupid.First, using the 'shaking camera' thing is effective when people are running, falling, fighting, etc. Using the amazing shaking camera when people are sitting and chatting, it's just stupid.Second, this movie pretends to be an alien invasion movie, but it's not. Actually, it's about this really great guy Rob or Tom or something and he had sex with this one girl Beth, and like, totally no one at the party knew that they had had sex, so now that an alien giant monster is attacking Manhattan, it's really important for Rob or Tom to go find Beth.Ya'see, 'Giant Alien Attacks Manhattan' is the headline. 'Stupid boy seeks girl in monster stricken city' gets coverage on p18, right? You can't make the alien attack the 'back story'. It didn't work in War of the Worlds which was 'really' about a divorcée trying to reconnect with his kids. It didn't work in Signs, which was 'really' about a man's quest to recover his faith.I'm all for Alien movies. I'm for love movies, divorcée movies and movies about recovering one's faith. I just don't like hyped up movies that pretend to be one thing but aren't. I mean, you don't even get to SEE the stupid alien. How dumb is that? Not to mention, an hour and a half of shaky cam and I literally went home and puked.Terrible, awful, bad movie. I want my money back.",1,42,84,19 January 2008
The Bourne Ultimatum," Great Movie - but ENOUGH with the Shaky Cam!
","This is exactly the movie we wanted - lots of action, with Bourne 2-3 steps ahead of his adversaries at every turn. It answered most of the questions from the first two in the series, but left plenty of room in case they want to make an ongoing series of Bourne films.But, good grief, what's with the shaky cam? I mean, it was a great day when they invented the steady cam, as it allowed the director to control what scenes are steady and what scenes are chaotic. But this movie uses 'shaky cam chaos' to illustrate how intelligence analysts sitting at their desks are working really hard. These aren't action scenes - for these scenes we need the actors to act, not to be blurry.So here's the deal: Directors can use shaky cam for fight scenes, car chases, explosions and any kind of stunt. Stationary people, sitting at desks? No! People sitting at a table arguing? No! Really, a great movie - a 9, except for the ridiculous overuse of shaky cam. STOP THE MADNESS.",7,19,33,5 August 2007
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Long, long, boring and long
","So, a movie about Jessie James that instead of being about gunfights and bank robberies is primarily about characters other than Jessie James, and the lies they tell each other.It is a in depth character profile of far too many characters. The pacing of the movie is all wrong, leaving the viewer for half hour segments with nothing to watch but the actors chewing the scenery. If it weren't for the brilliant casting and the wonderful performances offered, this movie would be outright dreadful.As it is, we're left with a director who apparently wanted to write an historical novel, not direct a movie, and a director of photography who is clearly in love with himself.A good movie should be of interest even to those not interested in the subject. Instead, this movie is about what the actors and directors want to offer. Express yourselves on your own time, gentlemen! My nine bucks was for ME to be entertained, not you.On the whole, a painfully slow and ridiculously long narrative about the James gang. Credit goes to the actors for making it tolerable, but a movie has to be more than just acting.",3,7,20,14 October 2007
The Purge," I want my money back
","I like horror movies. i even like BAD horror movies. But this is just too stupid.We're handed a premise: The US has adopted a single night per year when murder and rape and all manner of evil are not only allowed, they are legal and encouraged.No sooner than this bizarre premise is introduced than does the plot help us, the poor, stupid viewers, to understand how wrong we were. Yes, in fact, the idea of a purge night is a stupid, stupid idea. The son gets it, the daughter gets it. The mother and father get it, too. But since all the characters and all the viewers understand that purge night is a stupid, stupid idea, that makes it a stupid, stupid idea for a movie. Right? I could review the acting and directing, but really, what would be the point? Please don't waste your time and money.Newsflash for the writers, producer and director: The Viewers have to embrace your ridiculous premise before you make them realize it was stupid of them to do so. You can't jump right to the part where 'we should have known better'.Yeah, so I have it a 2 not a 1 - credit to the actors for attempting to make this believable.",2,3,6,8 June 2013
