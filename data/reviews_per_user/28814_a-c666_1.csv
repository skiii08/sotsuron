"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," Best film i ever saw!
","Priscilla is the best movie i have ever seen. I thought every bit of it was funny. I thought that the actors picked to play the 3 main parts were awesome. Hugo, Terence and Guy were brilliant throughout the movie. I also thought it was pretty silly and kind of a desperate attempt of eye candy using Guy Pearce. Even though he is awesome looking and all, in nearly every seen have his bum was hanging out of his pants. I think they over did it a bit with that one. Also when they do the performance in Alice Springs they're dressed up as animals, not women. I think that that was a bad choice of costumes. Even though they were excellent the didn't fit into the drag queen concept. But over all i thought it was fabulous!",10,3,6,13 September 2005
