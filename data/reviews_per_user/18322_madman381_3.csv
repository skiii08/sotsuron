Ali," Portrayed him well, but not his life
","Will Smith did an amazing job portraying Mr. Ali, in all the aspects of his life.  My girl, friend who knew nothing about him, now knows how great a fighter, and a man Mr. Ali was.  The problem is they did a terrible job portraying his life.  The Thrilla In Mannila was a greater, more monumental fight than the Rumble in the Jungle.  And it wasn't even mentioned, let alone given 1/3 of the film like the Rumble was.  Also, there was no mention of his Olympic Gold Medal.  That was a huge part of his early life and career.  These oversights brought down the movie.",4,0,0,26 December 2001
Spider-Man," Knowing the story it was still great
","Besides the amazing visual graphics in the movie, which to the exclusion on scene was truly amazing, the film offered so much more.  Having been an avid fan of Spider Man cartoons and comic books, I was worried they wouldn't do a good job telling the story, the case in the Bat Man films.  These fears were for nothing.  The story telling was supperb, and including the wrestling, along all the little details of his discovering his spider powers was done perfectly.  While some changes were made to keep the film modern, like the spider being geneticly enginered instead of radioactive, and removing his first girl friend who does get killed by the Green Goblin which was done for the sake of time.  Everything was great.  Hope to see the next when Harry becomes the green goblin, or fighting the Hob Goblin, or King Pin, and Simbiat, or Dr. Octopus.",10,0,0,7 May 2002
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," They did a great job.
","After reading all four books in the few months prior to seeing this film, I am very impressed with final product.  All the proper emotions were felt at the proper times, and the changes, except one, were perfect.  I don't understand why the task of which potion to drink to walk through fire was removed, but it was still great.  Looking forward to next year.",10,0,0,21 November 2001
