Marie Antoinette," Marie Antoinette vs Marie Antoinette
","Last evening I had the pleasure of watching the original Marie Antoinette from the 1930's, and today I watched the new (not improved) Marie Antoinette at the theater.The good:(2006) Costumes! Sets! It just doesn't get any better than the costumes and sets on this new Marie Antoinette movie. Hair styles were wonderful. Much of the movie appears to be filmed at Versailles and the gardens.The bad: (2006) Poor casting. I was disappointed to see Louis XVI with a five o'clock shadow at the age of 15. Both Marie and Louis did not portray the parts of a 14 and 15 year old very well. They both looked much to old. Parts of the movie were to drawn out and let my mind wonder away from the film.I anticipated not liking the music score in this new movie but was pleasantly surprised that I actually liked it and that it did not take anything away from the film.After watching both the old and the new Marie Antoinette, I prefer the older version much more, although the story line is almost identical. I think the older version is more a classic and is beautifully done.",7,1,3,23 October 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," just OK with me
","I love pirate movies. I love Erroll Flynn type Pirate movies. This was a disappointment to me. I thought that Johnny Dep was a poor choice for the main character. I like Johnny Dep, but the portrayal of a pirate is a reach.... not at all believable. He seemed to soft to be a pirate, not rugged enough. There were some good scenes, but not the ones with Johnny Dep. If you are going to watch this movie don't expect a classic Pirate Movie, you will be disappointed. I have no real desire to see part two any time soon. I don't think the characters were developed enough and it felt like the movie is probably catering to the kids and not to adults. It had no historical value either and seemed to be done on a limited budget. Just not as good as all the hype.",6,1,3,18 July 2006
Hostel," Not for the Weak
","The beginning of the movie should be rated X.. lots of sex and naked women. I was afraid the movie wasn't going to go anywhere except to the bedroom scenes. I was wrong. Lot's of blood and gore for all those who are looking for the excitement of a horror movie. I have been to Europe, including Eastern Europe and enjoyed seeing the scenery, buildings, etc, although in all honesty it doesn't matter a whole lot where it is taking place. I guess because it is taking place in Slovakia it makes it more believable for us westerners. Heck terrible things don't happen here! (Jeffrey Dahmer?). As I watched the movie, I was able to figure out what would happen next most of the time, but that can be said of most horror movies, but we watch them for their shock appeal. This is an average horror movie, but if this is your genre of movie, you won't want to miss it.",6,0,0,26 August 2006
Gone Baby Gone," Complex plot/Excellent Movie
","I found this movie to be well worth watching. It was perfectly cast and very believable. Being that Casey is from Massachusets he fit the lead characters role perfectly. I did have some difficulty understanding him at times, but I think that may have more to do with the microphones not necessarily being close enough to him when he spoke. I did not read the book, so don't know how close to the book the plot is, and I really don't care. I watched the movie to be entertained by a movie, not to compare it to a book.... The movie was well directed, scenes were very well done, with the exception perhaps at the quarry. I plan on watching again, which I seldom do, because I enjoyed it so much.",9,2,3,9 July 2011
The Village," Great Movie with a Different Plot
","This unusual movie struck me as very well done with a plot line that I had never seen done before. Very original. I loved the costumes and the laid back easy going, natural acting. The movie has some parts that make you think, and when the entire movie is over you ask yourself some pretty profound questions about life as we know it and life as it was 100 years ago. Which is better? Which is easier? This is a movie that the entire family could enjoy together and have a great conversation about after.The plot line is very plausible, which made it a great movie in my book!",8,0,0,30 October 2006
U-571," Not Historical
","I am always dismayed when a movie goes so far off the mark of reality, when the true story is so much more interesting. The British had already gotten the code before the Americans ever entered the war. I guess this is par for Hollywood to rewrite history. Why can't someone make a movie that is factual about some of the most interesting things in American history? If you want to just watch a movie that is fiction this may just be what you want. I find movies like this that distort actually history is very confusing to the uneducated historians of this world. I guess some may realize that this is fiction, but most will believe it is at least based on reality.",4,5,9,1 February 2011
Judgment at Nuremberg," Let's Rewrite History
","I am giving this movie a 3 for some wonderful acting and great cast. But when I see movies that try to rewrite history, and put a slant on it in a particular way, it drives me crazy. WW11, had many atrocities, from the slaughter of Catholics, to 400,000,000 Russians killed. I believe a better movie to show actual historic value is a movie called Enemy at the Gate. We Americans have been brain washed for way to long. Please remember this is a movie and deals very little in reality. On the plus side is some wonderful footage of actual scenes. Some great filmography, the cast is fantastic.Great propaganda film.",3,10,50,30 July 2010
Gone with the Wind," The Best Movie Ever
","I rate this movie as the BEST MOVIE ever. Such a wonderful movie. Great scenery, great casting, great costumes, wonderful plot. I love older movies and this one is the best. It develops the cast so you feel like you know them personally. You learn from the movie about the times of the civil war, you have a feel as if you were actually there. The movie was ahead of its time. Scarlet is so strong, she carries her family and friends through the horrors of war. And inter mixed with all the characters there is woven a love story. This movie makes you want to see part two..... how does it all end? I watched the movie and felt like I knew the characters as personal friends. A plus movie.",10,0,0,18 July 2006
The Adjustment Bureau," Boring Movie...
","I am being kind giving this movie three stars. I found it to be boring. I wondered if they left to much on the cutting room floor? They didn't develop the characters. The script left a lot to be desired. The premise of the movie was good, but that is the only positive I can give this piece of crap. I would suggest not wasting your time or money on this. I guess the idea of the Angels/Watchers/Fate that control what we do with our lives in interesting concept and could be developed into something wonderful, this ain't it. I found the suits and hats a little ridiculous. The doors sequences made no sense and did not help with the plot at all.",3,2,4,23 March 2011
Blood Diamond," Interesting Historical Look at African Diamonds
","I had the pleasure of watching this movie yesterday and found it to be interesting. The historical importance of this movie and the pursuit of diamonds was fascinating. I learned many things watching this movie, including how the illegal trade of diamonds was carried out and about the consequences of stealing diamonds from the mines. There are some very barbaric scenes, that help with the story telling. There are some action scenes, but for the most part the movie seemed a bit long and boring, my husband kept falling asleep while watching it, and we went to a matin√©e. I found the acting to be very well done, although I think that the fake accident Leo was using was foolish.. I would have enjoyed the movie more without it..",7,0,1,11 January 2007
Saw," great movie for a fun evening
","This movie is a little out there in it's plot, but it is extremely entertaining if you like suspense and who done it type movies. Yes there is a lot of blood and gore, but as long as you know that going in, you will probably enjoy the movie. I want to see it again, because there are several things that happen so quickly that it is easy to overlook some details. The movie has many twists and turns and I never saw the end coming. And even after seeing the entire movie, I am not sure exactly what happened. It is a low budget movie, with not many scenes or characters, but it is easy to get lost and not quite figure out what is happening. I can't wait to see Saw 2.",8,0,1,15 April 2006
The Departed," Oh MY!
","When you get to be my age (55) the memory starts to go. I saw this movie about a month ago and completely by accident went to see it today. I had forgotten I had seen it. That doesn't speak to highly for the movie. I guess it is forgettable. Some movies you see leave such a mark that you will remember them always. This is a good movie, but it is so much like so many other movies that it doesn't really leave it's mark on you. There is good acting by all involved in this flick. There is lots of action. Lots of dirty talking. Some confusion as to who is the good guys and who are the bad guys. Jack Nicholson does a believable job as the bad guy. I would suggest going to see this movie, but not twice!",8,1,3,29 January 2007
Donnie Darko," Teens Movie
","I guess I am just to old to enjoy a movie with a plot line like this. I have to say the music was great! And the acting was wonderful. The plot line, seemed like to much was left on the cutting room floor. The plot has real potential and it was enjoyable, but I didn't feel it was fluid. My take on the plot is that Donnie is schizophrenic but then the end of the movie I thought it might be the entire story was a dream before death, the unconscious mind similar to anesthesia, when your mind is in a deep sleep. I guess we are suppose to guess the meaning of the movie. I prefer a movie that tells the entire story, so I don't have to think so hard. I may try and see the movie again and see if I understand it better, but I am afraid I won't.",7,0,0,4 November 2006
