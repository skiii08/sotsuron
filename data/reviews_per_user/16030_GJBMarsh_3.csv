The Blair Witch Project," Garbage. Worse than garbage.
","There are occasionally films which do not only make one revaluate a genre, but indeed society and culture in toto. This is one of those films. Were it to have achieved such a feat intentionally or even directly, sincere praise might be appropriate. In fact it does not. Rather, this film demonstrates clearly the extraordinary stupidity and the implausibly high tolerance for mass market publicity that we have come to accept as normal.I will concede that qua conceptual art, there may be admitted some defence of originality in this work. In all other respects, it is entirely without redeeming feature.",Null,0,1,18 February 2000
The Matrix," Vastly overrated American derivative trash
","Anyone who has seen this film and raved about it, please re-consider: does it contain anything unique? No. Is it innovative? No. Is it exciting? Perhaps, but only because you are acclimated to MTV rather than to intelligent film-making.Avoid. Or failing that, ridicule.",Null,0,0,18 February 2000
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Hugely overrated rubbish
",I'll keep this short: there is no greater attestation to the essential intellectual vacuity of the vast majority of the population of the developed world than the success of the film 'Star Wars'.Why will people persist in confusing film as an art form and film as a medium of mindless entertainment. How can Star Wars possibly be rated on the same scale as films like Citizen Kane.,Null,0,2,3 August 1999
