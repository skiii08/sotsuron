Casablanca," Easily disputed as the best film in history
","Casablanca is one of the best films known to modern man.The entire set is based on the small, french owned town on the coast ofMorocco, where refugees running from Nazi Germany's oppression can stayuntil their visa's and other legal documents can be filed for safe transport out of the eastern hemisphere to America.The thing that really makes this film an original is the fact that it has almost all genres of story telling thrown into the mix of a current event film.  It has love, mystery, suspense, among countless other themes presented to the audience tokeep the seats filled and the tickets sold.This is a classic of classics, and runs up on the list higher (in the opinion of the reviewer) than Citizen Kane.  Albeit, the film does have some drawbacks, such as lengthy dialogues and some quite sappy scenes between the maincharacters (as well as some somewhat confusing plot points that are easilyavoided if the viewer knows his or her history) and a quite lengthy flashback.  But overall, this film is top of the line for the 20th century, and it only keeps the audience guessing what else the mystical town of Hollywood has in store for us in the future.",Null,0,0,22 April 2004
Citizen Kane," This movie is an instant classic, both in our time and in generations to come
","Citizen Kane...not many films can measure up to its level.  This dramatic film portrays the life of one man: Charles Foster Kane, a ruthless newspaper man who leaves one word in his rememberance: Rosebud. The entire film looks into this man's life through the views of his closest friends and aquaintances.   It also begins and ends with his death, and follows closely with the missing puzzle piece to his life, rosebud.This movie was far ahead of its time.  It was the first film ever to use special effects, and most of it is unbeknownst to the viewer.  The film is rich in symbolism to answer the questions of how and why something happens.
To be perfectly honest, this seems to be a basic black and white film that in todays culture would be unattractive and boring.  But it is much more than that.  And the makeup was enthralling!  They were able to make a 24 year old Orson Welles a some 70 year old man, and make it totally inconspicuous.  Not many films, even today, can do that.This film was very exciting and worth many viewings, and is the epitome of all films, which is why so many other productions have followed in the footsteps of this one outstanding film: Citizen Kane.",Null,3,4,17 November 2003
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," A hilarious perspective on the reality of war
","What a film.Dr. Strangelove (or how I learned to stop worrying and love the bomb)is a work of comedic genius.  It tells the story of the weapons race between the United States and the Soviet Union, with an added twist.  If the Soviet Union becomes the losing opponent, then the 'doomsday machine' will be activated and all life on Earth would be destroyed, while a B-52 is currently underway to drop the bomb that could spell certain doom to all living things.This film is pure comedic fantasy, intermxing real life situations and fictional situations between two secretly warring factions.  Almost every character in the film added some sort of comedic genius equivalent to any Jim Carrey movie.  This Reviewer gives this film a 7 out of 10 (10 being the highest) for it's origianality to a real life situation and it's ability to make even the most humor deprived person sneak out a chuckle or guffaw.  It's no wonder that this film is ranked so high on AFI's top list of best movies and should be influential to many future comedies in generations to come.",Null,0,1,5 April 2004
Some Like It Hot," A familiar plot that never keeps you guessing
","Lets face it.  This film is the same story everyone and their dog has seen athousand times and more.Two losers cross-dressing to do what they can to reach the big time ateveryones expense is very familiar.  Well, maybe minus the cross-dressing. But it is relevant to that plot line where someone is acting like something they're not to reach that same goal.  Frankly, it's over-used.This reviewer has seen too many of these plot lines that it just doesn't strike me as entertaining anymore.  But on a positive point, it still deserves a few laughs, which this film was able to deliver.Movies today are becoming repetitious, and this reviewer feels that for the good of the industry that plot lines should be revisited fewer so new ones can bemade.  Even if it means a third rate sequel.",Null,0,7,7 May 2004
It's a Wonderful Life," One person really can make a difference...
","It really is a wonderful lifeMost Christmas movies we see can be recognized around the world, especially those secular, seasonal films relating to the adventures of annual jolly gift-givers, magical beings made of snow befriending children, and peculiar deer who have the gift of a shiny nasal cavity... But this movie showed the reality of the holidays and life in general.  It's a wonderful life is a genuinely good film that show's that even the most simple of people can make such large differences.Good spirited George Bailey is the man we pay attention to, as we watch him grow up as a boy and meeting the special people in his life.  As he grows older, we see an impetuous person with high standards in life and plans for the future, but a flexible and labored person in the same when such adverse events such as *SPOILER* when his father dies and leaves the bank to him, and his brother serve in the war in Europe.  We see our impetuous George go through life as a banker with his uncle, when somehow all the money that the bank owned dissapears, meaning the destruction of Bailey's career, and his familiy's well being.  Suddenly, we watched the young, happy man slip into anger and fear, and the only way he believes to counter it is to end his life. Here is where the immature angel, Clarence Oddbody enters, and grants Bailey's wish of never being born.  We follow the two through the town of Bedford Falls in a journey to see the many lives he touched in his real life, and how his absence afflicted with what he knew.  Bailey changes his perception and returns home to live out his days happily with his wife and children.This movie shows how the real world and the holiday season conflict with each other, and how one person can make a difference in the lives of everyone around him.  It truly is an inspiring film, and encourages the mind to believe that it can also do great good to the people and things that it cherishes most in life.I believe that this film deserves a place as one of the most influential and best films of our time.  If only we could take the time out of our lives to imagine what good we do unto both ourselves and others.",Null,0,6,17 December 2003
Rear Window," An instant classic that will keep you guessing until the very end!
","What a film!Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window is an instant classic.  It will keepyou on the edge of your seat and guessing what could happennext throughout the entirety of the film.It tells the story of adventurer Jeffries who is stuck at home with abroken leg and spends most of his time staring out the rearwindow of his home and watching his neighbors work and playand converse.  Jeffries suspects one of his neighbors is amurderer and spends the entire film watching and waiting forsomething to happen, while romancing his girlfriend at the sametime.  This film was awe inspiring not due to special effects or dialogue,but the mood of the picture, along with the elements of mysteryand suspense to keep you on your toes.  It really shows how muchyou can learn about the outside world and how vulnerable you areto these same forces.  No, you never know what is out therewaiting, but watching this film teaches you to never doubt yourselfor your beliefs because ultimately, it makes you weaker and evenmore succeptible to whatever stalks what's right in front of you.",Null,0,2,16 March 2004
The Godfather," A dynamic film that has no substitute
","This film is truly one of a kind'The Godfather' tells the story of the Corleone family, an Italian family involved in organized and legitimate crime.  The patriarch (Marlon Brando) is beginning to lose rule over the family and his business, and new management must betaken over by either of his two sons, Sonny (James Caan) or Michael (AlPacino), along with tension between other crime families in 1950's New York.This is a very original and genuine story that truly has no substitute.  It is brought to life by a wonderful cast and it's powerful nature will grab the attention of even the most picky audience member.One scene this reviewer would like to point out is the scene in the italianrestaurant.  Pacino's character, Michael, is pulling out a gun from a bathroom stall.  As he does so, a train can be heard approaching.  As the bulk of the train screeches by, Pacino stands there, contemplaiting his next move.  As the train begins to fade from hearing, Pacino goes back into the restaurant and murders the two clients at his meeting.  This scene shows the change of Michael from the war hero, to the family's next hit man, as he steps onto the first rung of the ladder of eventual family succession.  The train, in the eyes (or ears if you prefer) of this reviewer, is symbolic of his transition.  Before the train: war hero; after the train: Hit man.This film is one of a kind.  It has it all: love, anger, drama, vengeance, honor, and a plethera of other emotions that one would think would be too much for onefilm.  It has certainly earned best movie in the eyes of the reviewer, and a piece of American art, culture and history.",Null,0,2,3 June 2004
