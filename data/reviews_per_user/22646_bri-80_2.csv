Requiem for a Dream," style over substance
","REQUIEM is so thrilling, so gorgeously edited, so detailed and hypnotic...why does it have to have such thin, stereotypical characters? Only Jennifer Connely and Marlon Wayans feel real. Ellen Burstyn plays her heart out trying to give dimension to a stereotype of a Jewish mother who is in essence, an imbecile. I'm sorry but being old and Jewish and living in Brighton Beach does not make you a moron. Jaret Leto similarly struggles with his Jewish version of Tony from Saturday Night Fever...does anybody even have that Brooklyn accent anymore? REQUIEM is a true indicator of where things are at in cinema in the year 2000:  unbelievable cinematic virtuosity alongside characterizations that are cliched, nostalgic, and just plain out-of-touch.",Null,0,1,19 October 2000
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Extremely satisfying, if flawed...
","The brilliant chemistry between Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill, and Harrison Ford is what made the first STAR WARS trilogy so good. Qui-Gon, Obi Wan, Jar-Jar, and Amidala don't have that edge, so PHANTOM MENANCE isn't as much fun. However, critics who claim that the plot of PHANTOM MENACE is the weak link are really off the mark. The political maneuvering of Senator Palpatine is fascinating, the illustration of the Galactic Senate awesome, and depiction of a society on the brink of an insidious fascist takeover, well, realistic. I admit that the more you know about the Star Wars galaxy, the better PHANTOM MENACE seems to be. So be it. George Lucas has delivered an essential (if flawed) addition to the Star Wars canon.",Null,0,0,13 October 2000
