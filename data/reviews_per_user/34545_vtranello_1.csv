Alien 3," Why, oh why?
","This movie makes no sense whatsoever. The very beginning is just killer. I know there have been countess discussions on 'how did the egg get there?'. But instead of going into that (which you can just read on the message boards, I will say this.This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and it's not just because of the random egg. These characters don't have any real development and the ones that do get killed anyway. On the special edition they change the entire way the alien was born. This movie was so miserable for David Fincher (who later redeemed himself by making Fight Club) that he was the only director who did not contribute commentary on the Quadrilidgy. Yes, I know he was brought on late, but it didn't stop the movie from being nearly a complete failure.It did have some things going for it, however. I like that this time they had a different host for the bug, so it moves diffrently. And Riply looks decent, even with shaved head. But that's about it.Most of the characters are alien fodder, it has numerous plot holes, and at the end of the day, it just wasn't really that good.Just pretend this and Resurrection didn't happen.",3,506,547,9 December 2007
