3:10 to Yuma," one of the best
","I have seen both versions of 3:10 and this one is better than the original. I can't say that for any other remake that i have seen. Russle Crowe and Christian Bale are excellent. I have to say that this movie is one of the best movies to come out of Hollywood in years. Not only is it a great western but anybody who enjoys a good story and an ending that you didn't see coming, this is the film to go see. I think anybody would agree with me. If you are waiting to see a good film that one day could be considered a classic I urge you to go get a ticket and watch this film. you will not regret that choice. The scenery is beautiful and the acting superb. I feel that this should at least should be considered for an academy award.",10,2,5,29 September 2007
