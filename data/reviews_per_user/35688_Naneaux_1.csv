The New World," I'm a Malick fan, but I'm sorry, this wasn't as good as his others
","I am thoroughly familiar with Malick's techniques, philosophies and his previous films, and I was completely bored by 'The New World.' Part of it may have been the unfortunate choice of Colin Farrell to play Capt. Smith (this boy cannot carry a film) but part of it also was the ultra-slow pacing and the complete lack of an interesting plot or any real dramatic tension in the action. We had plenty of pretty pictures to look at but it's just not enough. I was hoping for a historical romance like 'Days of Heaven,' but TNW lacks everything the other has-- story, great performances, engaging characters, drama-- except the gorgeous photography. The Wagner in the score annoyed me too because I KNEW it was Wagner and what is 19th century music doing in a 17th century story? I won't watch this one again.",5,0,4,29 January 2006
