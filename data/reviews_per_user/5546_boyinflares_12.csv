United 93," Heroes of a Different Kind
","Based on real-life events of the tragic day known throughout the world as '9/11', this film 'United 93' tells the tale of what happened aboard Flight 93, which is the hijacked plane that did not crash in to it's intended target, but, the terrorists were overthrown by the brave crew and passengers, who valued the lives of those they would save more than their own, proving that heroes come in many forms.'United 93' is a highly respectful film in terms of the sensitive nature of 9/11 and for the families of those aboard Flight 93. The story takes place, as one would expect, in almost real-time, flicking between the plane itself and various command centers, both military and aviation. Production values are high, and it's easy to see how much hard work has gone into making 'United 93' just right. However it seems to fall just short of that mark simply for the fact that, as an audience, we do not get to learn that much about the people aboard Flight 93. If this were any other 'disaster movie' that would be a disaster in itself, but since this is based on real life events, perhaps it was a good move, as the characters on the plane were real people, real heroes.Although little is revealed about the passengers, as the film tenses up it is easy to become compassionate for them as they watch what is happening. Most heart-breaking is, as expected, when the passengers begin the much-publicised phone calls to their loved ones. A brave move, and one which in my opinion paid off, was having no Hollywood A-listers amongst the cast. As there were plenty of characters, not everyone got a lot of screen time, but the standout performance easily goes to Trish Gates who plays Senior Flight Attendant Sandra Bradshaw. David Alan Basche, Cheyenne Jackson and Christian Clemenson also gave fantastic performances.'United 93' is, at times hard to watch, but it immortalises such heroic actions from 'regular' people that took place on the day that changed the world forever. Also, the film ends at a very good point. If the film had carried on further than where it did, it would have most certainly been in poor taste.",8,0,0,16 September 2006
Hostel," A Modern Day 'Video Nasty'?
","I had two expectations when going into this film. Firstly, that it was going to be just as good as 'Cabin Fever', and secondly, that I had heard it was brutal. Both expectations were met - and then some. Roth's direction and writing was terrific, there was never a dull moment in the film.The cast were all fantastic too. Jay Hernandez was great as hottie Paxton and moved from being care-free to fighting for his life with real conviction. Derek Richardson was also good as nice guy Josh. It was extremely difficult watching what happened to him. Ethor Gudjansson was rather annoying at times as Icelandic backpacker Oli. Barbara Nedeljakava and Jana Kanderbkava were both well cast as Natalya and Svetlana. Jennifer Lim doesn't get enough screen time as Kana, but she was awesome. Finally, Jan Vlasak was terribly creepy as the Businessman.Without giving too much away, I describe 'Hostel' as a modern day 'Video Nasty' (not that we really have video anymore, but you know what I mean) due to its extremely gruesome moments. The pain that you see these people go through, even though not real, is shown with such conviction you can almost feel it yourself. The little 'business' that is being run in 'Hostel' would be deemed so socially unacceptable that I'm surprised this film wasn't banned.A tremendous job well done to all those involved, the DVD will be great. Again, without saying too much, Natalya and Svetlana most definitely got what they deserved.",8,1,3,24 February 2006
Silent Hill," Silent Hill is anything but Silent
","Not a player of video games, I knew nothing about Silent Hill, but eagerly waited for the movie, as it looked amazing - not to mention the lovely Deborah Kara Unger is in it. Hopefully, because I haven't played the video game I can be rather neutral with my opinion of the film, which in summary, is rather disappointing. Maybe I missed out on enjoying the film to it's fullest extent because of not playing the game, but if an adapted film is going to be good, then one shouldn't have to have played the game (or read the book, or comic or whatever).Without going too in depth into the plot of the film, which in itself, is rather interesting, but highly confusing and there seems to be too much left unexplained. However, what is obvious is done very well. Direction and cinematography are great, special effects are hauntingly amazing and at times it looks like a video game - intentional or not, is actually quite cool. While coming across in the trailer as a horror, 'Silent Hill' isn't really that scary. There are some terrifying moments, but overall, it's more of a thriller-mystery. However, those little creatures that Rose first encounters at Silent Hill unbelievably scary - and the noise the make is nearly as terrifying as the noise made in 'The Grudge'.The acting is mixed. Radha Mitchell is a fantastic supporting actress, but taking the lead of Rose Da Silva in 'Silent Hill' she doesn't seem to quite pull it off, although her concern for her daughter is shown well. Sean Bean is convincing as troubled husband / father Christopher Da Silva and Laurie Holden is great as butch cop Cybil Bennett. The amazing Deborah Kara Unger (one of my favourite actresses) is barely recognisable as the outcast Dahlia Gillespie, a sad character whom one cannot but help have compassion for. It's a real shame she didn't get much screen time, but look out for Deborah in the flashback scenes where she looks more herself. The terrific acting continues in the form of Officer Thomas Gucci played by the wonderful Kim Coates and Alice Krige as the cruel Christabella. Rounding out the main cast is of course Jodelle Ferland who plays Sharon / Alessa, and does an admirable job.While falling short in some areas, 'Silent Hill' makes up for its mistakes by having a generally terrific cast, and for mentioning (though not until towards the end of the film) how people fear what they do not understand, and in Silent Hill, they burn what they are afraid of. Much along the lines of 'The Crucible'. Dahlia and Christabella's opposites are also interesting to watch. Finally, the amazing score and soundtrack featured in 'Silent Hill' (which is in general a very loud film) are great, and help to speed up some of the slower moments in the film. Disappointing, but not a total loss.",7,0,1,1 September 2006
Crash," Interesting, unique film
","When all the hype revolving around 'Crash' finally settled down, I thought it best if I finally rent the DVD to see for myself what this award-winning film is about. A lot of people had said it was very good, and being set in a post-9/11 environment intrigued me. However, while it was a very, very good film, it didn't quite grab me. I understand that it was probably supposed to leave a strange cold-feeling inside you after watching it, but I guess I just wasn't prepared for it.'Crash' is intense to say the least, and I'm not talking about the large cast and multiple story lines running alongside each other, but the overall narrative of the film is at times hard to take in at times. It definitely helps watching this if you know a bit about why various races do not like each other for whatever reasons they have. The content of the film is filled with offensive language, drug use, violence of almost every sort imaginable, and so on, and at times, makes for a very sad and depressing film.That is lifted however thanks to the outstanding cast. Matt Dillon, Sandra Bullock, Thandie Newton, Don Cheadle, Ryan Phillippe, Jennifer Espsito, Ludicrous, Brendan Fraser, Michael Pena and Terrance Howard are all stand out in their leading roles, but in particular Dillon, Phillippe, Newton and Pena. The spectacular Nona Gaye has a small role as the assistant to Brendan Fraser's character, Loretta Devine is as usual great in her small role, Daniel Dae Kim and Tony Danza make small appearances, as does the graceful Marina Sirtis (Deanna Troi from 'Star Trek: The Next Generation), and although the character she played seemed far too old for her, it is great to see Sirtis acting still, and that she hasn't lost any of her compassion.Overall, a interesting, unique film, that (I'll admit) at times was lost on me, but it makes for a very thought-provoking film and the cast are all terrific.",7,1,4,23 May 2006
Final Destination 2," Entertaining Sequel, best watched on DVD
","Unlike some sequels which don't directly follow the original, Final Destination 2 has a clear link to the original, of which (the event) is mentioned many times, Ali Larter reprises her role as Clear Rivers, though she isn't as impressive as she was in the first, possibly because she is playing second to the classy A.J. Cook.Following a fantastic opening sequence (the infamous high-way pile-up), the film moves at a steady pace, though resulting in a rather disappointing finale. While the film is not necessarily that scary, the deaths are very interesting, and most of the time take place just when you think everything is safe. Worthy of particular note is the death of Lynda Boyd's character who meets an untimely demise involving an elevator.The cast are all competent, with Larter, Cook and hottie Michael Landes as Thomas the police officer carrying the film. Keegan Connor Tracy is always good, and Lynda Boyd is very sympathetic. The actor who plays her son Tim, James Kirk, is pretty good too, the others who are all destined to die are rather annoying. Justina Machido (from 'Six Feet Under') is fabulous, once again playing a pregnant woman, who the group must somehow find.So while the film isn't groundbreaking, it is an entertaining watch with a mostly likable cast, good pace and some inventive death scenes. The reason I believe it is better watched on DVD is for the fun facts the pop up across the screen during the course of the film, loaded with trivia and behind the scenes info.",7,1,2,20 November 2005
Grease," Fun for everyone, but does it send a bad message?
","Perhaps the best musical of all time, surely right up there with 'The Wizard of Oz' and 'Chicago', this 1977 film set in the 1950's and based on the play of the same name is fun from the opening credits until closing - and beyond.The musical numbers are outstanding, 'Summer Nights' 'Hopelessly Devoted To You', 'We Go Together', 'You're The One That I Want' and 'There Are Worse Things I Could Do' are among my favourites. All the cast sing well and the dancing is amazing. Everyone looks great in the 1950's style outfits too, and the hair is awesome.Of course Olivia Newton-John, John Travolta and Stockard Channing are the stars of the show and are each amazing in their own right, but the supporting cast is terrific too. In particular, Didi Conn who plays Frenchy and, my favourite Dinah Manoff as the sultry Marty. Watch for Susan Buckner and Lorenzo Lamas in smallish roles as the school over-achiever and the school jock respectively. And let's not forget about Eve Arden and Dody Goodman as the school principal and her assistant, both so very funny.The one problem I see with this film is that it seems to send the message that if you want to be accepted by a new group of people then you need to change how you present yourself. All throughout the movie, Sandy (Newton-John) was never truly accepted by the Pink Ladies (except Frenchy), and Danny (Travolta) couldn't act like he liked her in front of his friends. I realise that those are genuine issues that take place at school, but the end result is disappointing, for Sandy changed her appearance and attitude, so everyone else could stay (mostly) the same. Still, it makes for a amazing movie.",9,2,4,17 November 2005
Little Miss Sunshine," A darkly enjoyable feel-good comedy
","'Little Miss Sunshine' is a fabulous feel-good comedy of a different kind - it is terribly dark, and at times depressing, but makes no apology for it, and it doesn't need to either. The film revolves around a more-than-slightly dysfunctional family who, all with their own subplots, travels to the Little Miss Sunshine Beauty Pagent so that young Olive can enter, and along the way learn a thing or two about each other, and what it means to be part of a family.The always-excellent Greg Kinnear plays father Richard, a man who means well, but sometimes fails to get across what he means, except of course when it comes to being a winner, as he has a 9-step program so that anyone can find the winner in themselves. However, his attempts to get people to purchase the program have been unsuccessful, causing strain with his wife, Sheryl who is played by the wonderful Toni Collette. Along the way to the Beauty Pagent, they are faced with a marital crisis.Their marriage is under strain also thanks to Sheryl's suicidal brother Frank (Steve Carrell) who happens to be depressed, and while despite being a genius, cannot sort out his love life, which he practically re-encounters on their journey. Alan Arkin plays Richard's cocaine-addict father, who has been mentoring Olive in her quest to be in the Little Miss Sunshine, which have unexpected results at the pageant itself.Paul Dano gives a compelling performance as Olive's brother Dwayne who has taken a vow of silence (yes, he is silent for the majority of the film), though he too learns something about himself on their journey and is forced to speak out. Despite fantastic performances from Collette and Kinnear, it is Abigail Breslin who steals the film as Olive. She lightens up the most depressing scenes and is utterly convincing in her innocence.At times it may feel like 'Little Miss Sunshine' is going nowhere, but it is a brilliant showcase of talent and story, which comes to a grand climax at the Little Miss Sunshine pageant, where you can't help but feel sorry for Olive, even though she may not know why anyone would need to feel sorry for her.",8,3,8,27 December 2006
Saw II," Another Piece of the Puzzle
","If you thought 'Saw' was great, well, brace yourself, because 'Saw 2' is fantastic. From the nail-biting opening to the terrifying (and surprising ending) Saw 2 will have you on the edge of your seat - that is, if you aren't hiding behind it. A likely premise involving a group of people somehow linked, intertwined with the cops on the case makes the fast paced story plausible.The cast is fantastic. Donnie Wahlberg and Dina Meyer make a great detective team. Beverley Mitchell and Franky G are both fantastic, Shawnee Smith is very good, and Tobin Bell, as 'Jigsaw' is very creepy.Be warned though, this film contains some seriously disturbing death scenes, lots of blood, plenty of jump scenes, oh and a reference to 'The Last House on the Left'.",8,1,2,16 November 2005
The Descent," An Unmissable Descent into Terror (excuse the pun)
","In 'The Descent' six girlfriend gather for their yearly caving adventure - only this time, one of the girls has discovered some caves which do not appear on any map - pity for them, as their fun adventure turns into a terrifying fight for their lives as they encounter some deadly sub-human creatures.So what is so fantastic about 'The Descent' then? Well, the acting for a start. All six young women are talented actresses who bring their respective characters to life. Shauna MacDonald plays the troubled Sarah, Natalie Mendoza is the over-achieving Juno, Alex Reid portrays the comely Beth, Saskia Mulder is the lovely Rebecca, and MyAnna Buring plays her sensitive sister, while Nora-Jane No one rounds out the cast as newcomer Holly.Secondly, the wait. You know something is going to happen, but the film does take a little while for the action and tension to begin. But it does have a sense of morbidness right from the beginning. 'The Descent', like many horror films, uses a back story, in this case a tragic event that happened one year earlier to Sarah, which plays an important part throughout the film.However, what's most memorable about 'The Descent' though is the terror that quite literally surrounds the cast when they are in these mysterious new caverns. And it's not just the mysterious sub-human like creatures - but the caverns themselves which prove to be dangerous for the trapped girls. People with claustrophobia should be cautioned before watching this film! The gore is brutal - there's no doubt about that, and as most of the girls, particularly Juno and Sarah, put up great fights against the creatures, the gore - blood, guts, everything - is plentiful - but without being distasteful. Particularly disturbing scenes include when Sarah falls into the pit of blood, the death scene where - I won't name her - is still alive and watching as the creatures begin to eat her, and a climatic and deadly encounter between two of the girls.'The Descent' combines the best parts of horror films and wraps them all into one tightly produced masterpiece - if the creatures don't get you, the caves certainly will.",9,0,1,7 April 2007
Wedding Crashers," A typical 'Frat Pack' movie
","I have a huge appreciation for Rachel McAdams, I think she is fantastic actress and hope she has a long and movie-filled career. McAdams was my main reason for watching this film, although I had many people tell me how good it was. I, however, was not overly impressed. Although I think Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn are good comedians, I felt that their performances here were sub-par, and their characters could have been played by any member of the 'Frat Pack', or another comedian too.The premise of the film is an interesting idea, it basically consists of John (Wilson) and Jeremy (Vaughn) crashing weddings to hook up with chicks. Eventually, after a long opening scene, they crash the wedding of an important family - the Cleary's - and John falls for Claire (McAdams), who is engaged to Zachary Lodge (played by the hilarious and gorgeous Bradley Cooper) who is arrogant and controlling, while Jeremy becomes subject to the unwanted attentions of Gloria Cleary (Isla Fisher of 'Home & Away' fame, who gives a terrific performance here).The typical antics follow, with the guys dealing with their respective situations, and eventually having a fall-out between themselves, though the movie closes with a happy ending all 'round, well, for most people. The film was highly predictable, and at times boring. The rest of the cast were mixed - Christopher Walken gives the first performance of his that I actually liked, the lovely Jane Seymour was severely under-used, Will Ferrell was annoying, Keir O'Donnell's character was rather pointless and poor Rebecca DeMornay, why she subjected herself to such a bit part is beyond me.Watch this film if you like, but you may be subjected to severe boredom. The only reason I gave it such a high rating was due to McAdams.",6,1,1,30 March 2006
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Just try falling asleep in this film - you won't be able to!
","There are two reasons you won't be able to fall asleep during Wes Craven's A Nightmare on Elm Street. Firstly, because it is such a fantastic film and you won't want to miss a second of it, and secondly, because Freddy will get you. At least, you may begin to believe that.What's so great about A Nightmare on Elm Street (not just the first film, but the entire series in general), is that Freddy is a unique horror antagonist. He stalks you in your dreams - somewhere that is going to be hard for people to come and rescue you. Being inside someone's mind, Freddy knows his victims weakness's and can use this to his advantage.Unlike other horrors which have a large cast of teens ready for the killing, the first Nightmare on Elm Street was limited to four, played by Nick Corri, Amanda Wyss, Johnny Depp and of course the fantastic Heather Langenkamp. The former three are all very good on their limited roles, but it is Heather Langenkamp as Nancy Thompson and co-icon of the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise (alongside Robert Englund's Freddy Krueger) who really shines. Though Jamie Lee Curtis may be the Scream Queen (and rightfully so), Heather Langenkamp should be the Princess of Horror. Her character, Nancy is one tough cookie and fights back against Freddy, while the authority figures in the film, stumble about. John Saxon and Ronee Blakely play Mr. and Mrs. Thompson and both do a great job.So while the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise may have made various mistakes in the later films, the first one remains a classic of the slasher genre, with a vibrant cast, awesome storyline, scary villain and great direction from the legendary Wes Craven.",9,0,0,7 December 2005
Click," A very surprising and thoughtful comedy
","When I first saw the trailer for 'Click' I thought something along the lines of 'oh, just another dumb Adam Sandler flick' but after begrudgingly going to see it with a friend, I was quickly proved wrong. 'Click' tells the tale of busy architect Michael Newman (Adam Sandler), and how his life dramatically changes when he is given a remote that lets him control time, so he can skip the arguments with his wife, get work projects finished quickly and basically spend time doing what he wants. But things take a turn for the worse when the remote, after becoming accustomed to what he likes to skip through, ends up skipping through whole periods of his life....Adam Sandler was terrific as Newman, and although he has long ago proved he is a terrific comic actor, he really shines in the dramatic moments here. The rest of the main cast are just as good, and everyone has an important role to play, and nearly everyone gets to appear in the various time periods, it is interesting seeing them all age. Kate Beckinsale is excellent as Newman's long-suffering wife, Christopher Walken plays the enigmatic Marty (whom Neman got the remote from), and I think this is the first film I have seen him in where he doesn't annoy me! David Hasselhoff also proves that he is indeed a good actor with his performance as Ammer, Newman's demanding boss.The terrific cast continues with Henry Winkler and the lovely Julie Kavner playing Ted and Trude respectively, the parents of Sandler's Michael Newman. Both are outrageously funny, and both will make you produce a tear or two - happy and sad. It's also very interesting to see Kavner on screen as opposed to simply hearing her unique voice on 'The Simpsons'. Sean Astin as Bill doesn't get much screen time at the beginning of the film, but he plays an important role later on, and is very good. Jennifer Coolidge is outrageous as ever playing Donna's friend Janine, she is a very, very funny woman - watch out for her in one of the flashback scenes as well, she's a scream! Australian pop-star Sophie Monk has a small role as Ammer's assistant, though she doesn't get to show off as much as she did in 'Date Movie'.The children of Michael and Donna Newman also have important roles in the life of their father, both in the present and future. Joseph Castanon plays Ben at age 7 and Tatum McCann plays Samantha at age 5, and both are on their way to being fine actors if they so desire. Playing the 22-30 year old Ben is Jack Hoffman, and the 22-30 year old Samantha is the elegant Katie Cassidy, both fantastic.What surprised me the most is obviously that 'Click' is unlike other Sandler films, in that it is very 'grown-up', and has deep meanings to it. Of course there is also plenty of humor thrown in, some of it rather crude (most scenes involving the Newman's pet dog), but nevertheless amusing, and no doubt appealing to any children that watch the film. Hopefully, the moral of the story is not lost on children either, the moral being something along the lines of life being precious and one should never wish that they could simply skip a part of their life, and also that we need to value our parents, family and loved ones - after all, death could only be a 'Click' away. Highly recommended.",9,1,6,1 August 2006
