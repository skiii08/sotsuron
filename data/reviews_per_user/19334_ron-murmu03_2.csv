Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Damm Regret If You Love Sherlock Holmes Please Do Yourself An Favor.
","Waking up early in the morning to catch the first day first show of Sherlock Holmes because you are a serious Guy Ritchie fan and have seen all his movies and loved them,well I had some ideas that maybe it wont be good enough and guess what i was right.I was disappointed with Guy Ritchie and Robert Downey Jr whom people are regarding as an 'Amazing Actor' well let me just tell you this Game of Shadows was a complete downer not only because of drifting screenplay and predictable plot but also because of juvenile acting done by our Mr Holmes here.The script was fine but i sincerely felt the previous movie was way better than this one.Only Jude Law and Jared Harris saved the day for me throughout this 129 minutes of what they call a movie which actually was a messing up everything Sir Arthur Conan Doyle worked on.",5,17,32,3 January 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Yes that is how you end trilogies
",Gotham's reckoning.Well TDKR the last installment of the Nolan's Batman series ended in the perfect note the way trilogies are a supposed to end the real trilogy. So whats so great about this movie? This movie has it own moments when you get the chills on several occasions about whats is going to happen next it is almost breathtaking.Brilliant performances by all the actors in the movie.Hans Zimmer did it again by making the perfect score for the movie which will glue you to the seat and a wonderful plot which brings justice to the entire series. But but there is a but there are a few things which i felt should have been how it was which I am not going to mention because this needs to be a spoiler free review and i want it to be but this movie is worth every penny. Is this movie better than The Dark Knight? Well to that I have to think about it I cant sum up to the conclusion yet but again for me Batman Begins revolves around Batman The Dark Knight about the people of Gotham TDKR well why are you still reading this go watch it for yourself as i said it was worth every dime ...,6,6,8,20 July 2012
