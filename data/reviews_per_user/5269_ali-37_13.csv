3:10 to Yuma," fantastic
","First of all, I am not a huge fan of westerns but this movie was absolutely captivating because of the sheer power of good acting. I think that Christian Bale and Russell Crowe are two of the finest actors today. Bale steals the movie but credit must be given to the direction which includes closeups of the actors. Great story based on Elmore Leonard short story. Good writing is the key to good movies and it is so seldom seen today. I can't imagine how Glenn Ford played the Crowe character in the original so I'll have to rent it. Right now I view this as the best movie of the year so far. I recommend it highly and hope that it signals a return of good writing to the cinema.",10,2,6,7 September 2007
Unbreakable," Brilliant script
","This may go over the heads of the non-thinkers who may find it slow going but this is an absolutely brilliant and innovative film. I went in expecting to be jerked around with a sappy ending but once again, as in The Sixth Sense, M.Night delivers. I had no clue. It's better if one knows as little as possible before seeing the film. Bruce Willis and Samuel Jackson are perfectly cast. Unfortunately, they will probably be passed over at Oscar time because this film has no sex or perversion in it. For Shame on Hollywood.",Null,0,0,24 November 2000
The Village," Bad Marketing
","This movie is not at all what it is being marketed. It is not a horror film.   It is not very scary at all but it does havemoments of suspense. It is very clever and one that will keep you thinking about long afteryou leave the theater. Though not as good as the Sixth Sense, it's better than Signs.Even the complaints I had about the stilted acting and slowdirection is explained away by the plot. I thought it was a very, very clever love story.. I recommend it but people should keep an open mind.",Null,0,0,30 July 2004
Gran Torino," Very Important American film
","Who knew Eastwood could act? But more than that the script is excellent Walt Kowalski is a dying breed, a Korean War vet who grew up in a politically incorrect era. His type is dying out and we may all be the worse for it. The best line of the film is when the young Sue thanks him for being good to her brother and compares him to her traditional father. When Walt tells her that he's traditional too, she says, ' But you're an American.' 'Being an American is unique. We have the freedom to speak freely whether we hurt feelings or not. That kind of language mutes hate and becomes bantering. Political correctness and multiculturalism is destroying what made this country great. Bigotry and prejudice will be eliminated by exposure not legislation or sensitivity training which just makes it go underground. Basically Kowalski is still a good man, not perfect, but good and decent. I loved this movie and will own it when it comes out on DVD. bet it makes more than MILK.",10,1,4,3 January 2009
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Hollywood fiction at its most liberal
","For some strange reason, Hollywood seems to have created the illusion that that dreaded blacklist was the fault of a drunken Republican Senator, Joe Mccarthy. It would be nice if just once, the truth was out there for all to see. The blacklist was initiated by the studios who were cowards and could have stood up to the government. Good night, and Good Luck is well done but a fraud. I remember watching Ed Murrow in the '50's. He was boring. As for the HUAAC, he never addressed the underlying issues of communist spies in Hollywood which turned out to be true. Those writers and actors were pawns of the Stalinists because there are very few bright bulbs in la-la land. So far I've read only one decent review of the film.That's by James Bowman of the NY Sun.",2,21,78,7 October 2005
The Departed," I was never a Leo fan but...
","...I came away from The Departed with the firm conviction that he should win the Academy award. His Character Costigan is so memorable, poignant, tough, smart and tragic. By all means, all the acting is great. Kudos to Wahlberg, Sheen and Damon. Jack Nicholson is over the top but so what. The film is full of tension yet it's not the kind that makes you nervous but rather it's the type that is thrilling and exciting. There are not many films made today that I can sit through twice but I'd sit through this one again and again just to watch Leo deCaprio act. I'm looking forward to his Blood Money film for the same reason.",8,0,1,3 November 2006
Love Actually," Great-Why the porn?
","This is so typically Hollywood-putting in a Boogie night couple in aChristmas movie that could have been great. I loved Hugh Grantand Colin Firth. I laughed, I cried, I puked at the porno film scenesand I ask again why? Don't those idiots know that a PG-13 wouldmake more money than an R at Christmas time? These lamebrains are so dense. I wish that born again group that cleansup dirty movies for DVD will get ahold of this one because I reallywould like to see it again minus the trash.",Null,0,1,9 November 2003
Shooter," Disappointing version of a great book
","What a shame Stephen Hunter didn't write the screenplay because it certainly would not have ended in such a typically Hollywood way. The original hero was a Vietnam veteran sniper. Natually, Hollywood had to include a Senator spouting nonsense about the Iraq War being all about oil and that the government always lies because money rules the world, blah, blah, blah. Hunter's Bob Swagger is a true hero who only killed people trying to kill him. The ending of the Shooter just makes Swagger look like a killer. The best book of the series if one called Black Light. It's fantastic but I'd rather never see it get made if they're going to destroy the character.",Null,2,3,29 March 2007
The Blind Side," A First. A Sympathetic Republican
","This is the first time Hollywood has ever presented such a compassionate, sympathetic portrayal of a Southern Christian who also happens to be a card carrying NRA member. I was blown away by Bullock's performance. I'm not a big fan of Bullock but she was absolutely great in this role. I had heard a lot of praise about this movie but felt it would be over dramatic. It wasn't. The acting was superb and if I didn't know that this was a very true story I would think that someone made it up out of a Sweet and Low. there was an unnecessary dig at Pres. Bush at a government agency. That's not surprising. After all this is Hollywood made. As long as it didn't come from Bullock's mouth it was believable. Civil servants are always Democrats.",10,0,1,15 February 2010
Blow," So typical of Hollywood
","Blow isn't a terrible film . It's somewhat entertaining but ultimately very disappointing. It had so many possibilities given the subject matter and the time period. Instead, it tiptoed over its message of depicting the main character as a victim. The ultimate message is that he would never had ended up in jail if he wasn't such a nice guy. Get real. I think everyone in Hollywood has so much snow up their nose, they can't see straight. Johnny Depp is adequate but he's getting such overhyped reviews he might end up believing he can act. The film glosses over the fact that this character introduced cocaine to the masses and is probably responsible for countless deaths. Boo hoo, he's in jail and can't see his daughter. Typical Hollywood drek!",Null,0,0,7 April 2001
Tombstone," This movie proves Oscars are a joke
","I am not a connoisseur of westerns but whenever this is on TV, I end up watching it again and again. It is the very best western I've ever seen. Val Kilmer is the real star of the film. He was not nominated for a Best Supporting Oscar. Neither was the movie nominated. Martin Landau was just OK in Ed Wood. Val Kilmer's every line in the movie is memorable and quotable.' I'm your huckleberry.' 'Why Johnny Ringo, you look like someone just walked over your grave.' ' My hypocrisy knows no bound and so much more.' His death scene brings tears to my eyes and is real acting. The Oscars no longer care about talent only marketing. I no longer pay attention to them anymore.",10,1,3,27 June 2013
Signs," I loved this movie
","A lot of people are simply not going to get this movie-in the same way that many did not understand Unbreakable. It's better to see this film without any expectations. It is not the Sixth Sense but it is wholly satisfying. A lot depends on whether you are a Type A as defined in the film. If you are, you will love this movie. If not, you will probably dismiss it as something trivial. I had read a lot of the previews and I expected to be disappointed so that may be why I was so pleasantly surprised. M. Knight is really a very effective director and his script is very good. There are parts that are slow but they have to be because the dialogue during these moments are very important to the theme. I highly recommend it.",Null,0,1,6 August 2002
X2: X-Men United," Wonderful entertainment
","I never really cared all that much about the first X-men movie because I'm not a fan of the comic books. This sequel far surpasses the original in its entertainment value. Some comic book purists are complaining about the authenticity of the characters in X2 but as entertainment, it can't be beat. I had bought the DVD of X-men and had to watch it again as soon as I got home. It doesn't hold up but now I want to read the comic books. X2 had a swell story. I especially found Nightwatcher's Catholic faith rather surprising considering Hollywood's usual anti- religious agenda. I was told that this is true to the comic story. Very interesting, indeed. So far, this is my favorite film of the year. I give it a 10.",Null,0,0,23 May 2003
