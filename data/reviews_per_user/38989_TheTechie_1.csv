Marie Antoinette," Did anyone watch this before they released it?
",So the question stands to if someone actually watched this movie before it was sent to theaters. I work at a movie theater and had to preview it before its release to audiences and it looked more like the cutting room floor hits the big screen than any kind of a movie! There were no less than 27 separate boom mics visible. Add to that a bunch of partially closed shutters used to keep glare off the lens. At one point more than half the shot is black due to one of the shutters! Did our theater just get a really messed up print or is it that bad? The movie itself was a bit slow. But you really felt for Antoinette. I really wanted to see it for the design and in that aspect I was not disappointed. The costumes and sets were beautiful!,2,2,10,18 October 2006
