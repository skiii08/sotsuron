Hereditary," You folks must be desparate!
","Wow, what a bad movie. Almost walked out of the theater except I was committed at that point. Goes from really slow to really dumb. No way is this comparable to the Exorcist, the Shining, or any other classic horror movie that I have seen in the last 40 years. Just bad. Only reason I am giving it a 3 is the acting was decent.",3,9,23,12 June 2018
Get Out," I can't believe the Great Ratings!
","Wow. I am a first time writer of a review on IMDb. I am a BIG movie fan and have watched almost every movie ever made.This movie is a huge stinker. Totally predictable and horribly pointless. I am still pondering why I wasted almost 2 hours of my life on this painfully horrible film.I must admit that the lead actor, Daniel Kaluuya, did a wonderful job with his role in the film. I really enjoy a good thriller, but this was not one that I will add to my list to recommend.",1,9,24,26 May 2017
A Quiet Place," You've got be kidding, right?
","I'm not going to repeat every plot hole that has been said by several level headed, logical people on this forum, other than to say it has MANY. I was so distracted by the implausibility of most of the plot, that I couldn't enjoy the movie. Seemed to me to drag on-and-on.Are there some good suspense scenes? Yes. Is the acting pretty damn good by the 2 lead actors? Yes. Unfortunately the plot makes this a pretty poor movie in my book. If you have a logical mind, this one is a no-go.",3,12,25,14 April 2018
The Greatest Showman," Best movie from hollywood in a long time.
","This is my first ever review on IMDB. I have watched almost every movie in the last 15 years and have been silent. I was amazed at the dismal quality of movies in 2017 and thought it was perhaps one of the worst years for movies in a long time. Come 2018, my wife and I decide to see TGS. WOW!!!!. The music, the choreography, the dancing was all amazing. It makes LA-LA-Land look like a B-movie. This reminds me of Moulin Rouge, which we over and over for the music and dancing.If you like original movies, not never ending remakes, go see this movie. It is amazing. I promise you wont be disappointed.",10,78,150,4 January 2018
