It," I really felt like i was part of the losers club.
","OK, so i just saw the IT movie and IT was pretty great (pun intended). This is a movie i was (of course) waiting for quite some time to be honest. It is overall a very OK shot movie, with some takes and planes that really stood out. The cinematography wasn't something particularly different from other films of the genre, but i allow myself to say that it was pretty decent and i really can't complain. One of the things this movie will probably be most remembered for are the casting choices and the lead children's performances. It is hands down the best feature of the film. Seeing how every single kid gave and amazing performance was not only the base of the idea this movie was intending for, but a pretty refreshing situation that i was really enjoying watching at the big screen. I have hardly no complaints regarding the kids except for maybe one or two brief moments that it drop down a little. However, have that being said it wasn't a flawless movie. I do have some issues with one of the antagonistic forces of the films known as 'the bully' Henry Bowers. He isn't actually mentioned once as a 'bully' but the reality is that his character is so poorly fleshed out that calling him 'the main bully' basically summons up his entirely personality. The movie tried to give a compelling backstory to make the audience care for him but it really didn't do much.My last point that i want to explain is that even though the performance of Bill Skarsg√•rd's Pennywise was very good and fit his character perfectly, the decisions made regarding the approach of how the film was going to deal with the character ultimately made a good antagonist but it sacrificed the Horror theme of the movie almost completely. Overall a film that when i finish watching i was eager to see again, and i will rate this one a 7.5/10",7,4,6,16 September 2017
