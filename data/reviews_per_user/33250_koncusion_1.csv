Skyfall," Bond is Resurrected!
","Hearing so many rumors before the movie came out, I thought they were going to trail away from the true bond that we all love. I couldn't have been any wronger. Not only did they bring the true bond back, but they continued a franchise and reverted back to the old style bond. They kept to the James Bond references that make Bond, Bond.I never thought Daniel Craig could pull off such a good bond. I thought Casino Royal was good but more of a entrance for Daniel Craig's James Bond. Great Job Daniel Craig and the rest of the Crew. Stick to the old bond and you will continue to succeed. Go see this and you wont be disappointing.",10,4,13,12 November 2012
