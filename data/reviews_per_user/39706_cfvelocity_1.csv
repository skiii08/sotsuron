Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Amazing Movie
","I loved this movie and would definitely recommend seeing it- granted, it was much different than the first volume; not as much action, much more dialogue and character development, but equally on par with the first installment. I had read that Quentin Tarentino was going for an East-meets-West combination, and in my opinion, he nailed it.  If you're looking for more of the first installment, then you might not like the second half as much since it's more story than action- I personally thought the second half was just as good as the first, but for different reasons- the acting was amazing and I unlike most movies out in this day and age, I cared about what happened to the characters.  Overall, I loved it and can't wait until it comes out on DVD.In closing, I personally wouldn't base going to see a movie or not going to see a movie on people's reviews- you might view the movie differently and every person has their own personal taste so definitely check it out for yourself!",10,1,2,17 April 2004
