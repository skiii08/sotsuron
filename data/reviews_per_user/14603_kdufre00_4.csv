Requiem for a Dream," The red dress
","'Requiem for a Dream' is easily one of the best films of 2000, one that deserves to be remembered for many years to come.  As I was watching this film for the first time, I was overwhelmed by Darren Aronofsky's bold film-making techniques.  By the end, however, I appreciated the immediacy and unabashed truthfulness they gave each scene.  Despite its often discordant style, 'Requiem for a Dream' is a moving film that flows seamlessly.  It contains many disturbing images, but never does anything seem thrown in just for the sake of shocking the audience.  What we get instead is a deeply felt story about four people whose lives are crippled by their addictions.Many people have referred to 'Requiem for a Dream' as an anti-drug movie, which it certainly is! It definitely provides a vivid account of how drugs complicate the lives of the four principal characters, as each slowly descend into his/her own personal hell during the film's wrenching climax. However, 'Requiem for a Dream' is as much a film about human frailty and longing as it is an anti-drug movie.  It wasn't until the second time I saw this film that I recognized Sara Goldfarb's red dress as a symbol for the unattainable dreams that each character desires to fulfill.  The scene where Sara is visited by her son Harry and she tells him that the red dress 'is a reason to wake up in the morning' really drives this point home.  She yearns for the time in her life when her husband was still alive and Harry was still close to her, much the same way that Tyrone yearns for the comfort and love he once felt in his mother's arms.  Also, in two dream sequences, Harry is seen approaching Marion, who is at the end of a pier wearing a red dress (an image that is used for the poster art for this film).  Such an idyllic scene as this is offset by other scenes depicting each character in the throes of their respective addictions.Ellen Burstyn's fearless portrayal of Sara Goldfarb, the lonely and helpless widow beset by her addiction to diet pills, gives 'Requiem for a Dream' its emotional center.  She deserves all the accolades she has received for this performance.  Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans also deserve recognition for their committed performances.  Matthew Libatique's photography and Clint Mansell's hauntingly dark score add immensely to this film.  And I really look forward to Darren Aronofsky's future films.  With 'Pi', Aronofsky made a very promising start, and with 'Requiem for a Dream' he lives up to that promise.",Null,0,0,28 December 2000
The Sound of Music," Timeless classic
","I just bought the new DVD version of 'The Sound of Music' and I am just as in love with this musical as I was when I saw it for the first time as a third grader some 10-15 years ago.  And I still get teased for liking this movie!I can understand why some people might be turned off.  This movie has been called 'corny.'  And while some of the dialogue is questionable at times, the songs more than make up for it.  They are all very delightful and catchy, from 'How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria?' to 'Do-Re-Mi.'  If you see this movie, don't be surprised if you find yourself singing the songs to yourself days afterwards.  They are simply infectious!The actors also transcend the occasional shortcomings of the dialogue.  The von Trapp children are energetic and likeable.  I especially liked Liesl, played by Charmian Carr.  The scene where she sings '16 Going on 17' with Rolf is unforgettable.  It is a shame that 'The Sound of Music' is Carr's only film.  She really has great talent.Julie Andrews will always be remembered for this film.  You just fall in love with her from the moment she opens her mouth to sing the opening song. Christopher Plummer is also terrific as Captain von Trapp.  Every time I watch the scene where he sings 'Edelweiss' to his children, I am genuinely moved.  I also loved the sexual tension between Maria and Captain von Trapp.  I know that this movie is a 'family film', but even as a child I found it strangely erotic, particularly the party scene where Maria and Captain von Trapp dance together in the courtyard.  The tender love scene between Maria and the Captain after he breaks up with the Baroness is also very erotically charged.This movie is definitely one of the most sentimental films I have seen.  To some people, this is a bad thing.  But I bet if they gave this movie half a chance, it wouldn't take long for them to be enchanted.  It is such a great, moving story.  The photography is breathtaking, the actors are wonderful, and the songs and choreography are not to be missed.",Null,1,7,7 September 2000
American Beauty," Every rose has its thorn
","I have seen 'American Beauty' a total of four times.  The first time I saw it, I was stunned.  But with each additional viewing, I found myself less and less impressed.This is not to say that 'American Beauty' is a mediocre movie.  I think it is great, in that it gives viewers plenty to think about in terms of everyday issues like one's identity, suburban ennui, personal responsibility, fantasy and repression.  It also has great performances all around.  Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening are memorable in their roles.  Mena Suvari has a particularly poignant scene with Kevin Spacey within the film's final ten minutes.  And why wasn't Wes Bentley nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar?My problem with 'American Beauty' lies with Kevin Spacey's character Lester Burnham and how the movie leads the viewer to believe that he is 'the hero.' I must admit that I found myself rooting for Lester the first time I saw this movie.  But with subsequent viewings I found that there was little to nothing heroic about him.  In fact, I found him repulsive at times.  For example, there's the scene where his daughter (Thora Birch) confronts him about his not-so-subtle fawning for her best friend Angela (Mena Suvari). He quips back, 'You better be careful, Jane.  Or you're going to turn into a real bitch just like your mother!'  If I remember correctly, this line was met with plenty of applause and laughter from the audience.  I actually thought that this was a horrible thing for a father to say to his teenage daughter.  Jane has every right to be angry with him! But the movie leads the audience to be more sympathetic to Lester.  This is only one of several examples of misogyny in 'American Beauty.'Annette Bening's character, Carolyn, also suffers at the expense of Lester's metamorphosis.  'American Beauty' would have benefited greatly had it presented Carolyn in a more sympathetic manner.  While Lester is 'the hero' of the film, Carolyn is presented as this shrill harpy with very few redeeming qualities.  This film does afford Carolyn some potentially sympathetic moments where the audience feels for her, but they never really come into fruition.  Ultimately, she is more of a cartoon character than she is a real person to whom an audience member can relate.My final complaint about 'American Beauty' is that it gives the viewer a little too much to swallow.  Some of it was just too implausible and unlikely for me to completely buy it.  It asks the viewer to accept too much on simple faith.  One thing that jumps to mind is when Ricky Fitts (a terrific Wes Bentley) reveals to Jane that he has $40,000 saved up from all of his drug deals and he asks her to run away with him.  And she accepts. Maybe I am just naive, but I find it very unlikely that an 18-year-old would have that kind of money even if he is a big-time drug dealer.  Not to mention being able to get away with it under the vigilant eyes of a strict father (Chris Cooper).  And I didn't completely buy Ricky and Jane's relationship either.  What would compel her to become romantically involved with someone who obsessively videotapes her in an almost menacing way?Despite all this quibbling, I do think 'American Beauty' is a worthwhile film to see.  I thought its boldness was very fresh, for the most part.  It is very watchable, with plenty of characters and scenes to savor.  It also features great cinematography and music.  Just don't be fooled by the heavy accolades it has been getting from critics who treat it as if it's the second coming.",Null,0,0,3 August 2000
Rosemary's Baby," Why wasn't Mia Farrow nominated?? (mild spoiler)
","'Rosemary's Baby' is, without a doubt, my favorite horror film.  Instead of relying on blood and violence to scare audiences it uses genuine psychological tension.  This film shows that you don't need to witness gore and violence in order to be scared.  I think what makes this movie scary and disturbing is the fact that all these terrible things are happening to such an innocent, trusting and helpless character like Rosemary.  Casting the then 22-year-old Mia Farrow was ideal.  A delicate beauty, Farrow projects Rosemary's vulnerability to perfection.  Never have I felt sorry for a character the way I feel sorry for Rosemary in this film.  The paranoia and tension she experiences throughout the film is contagious.You can particularly empathize with her at the party scene when her girlfriends are comforting her in the kitchen.  What makes this scene so painful is that it shows how truly alone Rosemary is, the way her pent-up anxiety pours out in the presence of her estranged friends.  The compassion she receives is very moving.  The scene where she contacts Dr. Hill from the phone booth is another one of my favorites, because it gives you a nervous feeling in the pit of your stomach as well as a glimmer of hope that someone may finally believe and help Rosemary.  The fact that we trust Dr. Hill the way Rosemary trusts him makes his ultimate betrayal all the more horrifying.It is too bad that Roman Polanski's most recent films aren't of this caliber.  Before he directed 'Rosemary's Baby' he directed 'Repulsion', another great psychological thriller.  Both of these movies are creepy in ways most movies are not.  The apartments in both films provide great atmosphere.  To anyone who happens to read this review, I urge you to rent both this film and 'Repulsion' for Halloween night.  They make a great double feature!",Null,2,4,12 October 2000
