First Man," Very very average. Ryan Gosling is appalling as usual.
","Going against the grain here, but I was completely underwhelmed. It's a good story, but the cinematography was a definite miss for me. Action shots during the launches etc held for far too long. Ended up fast-forwarding a lot of them. Really who wants to watch 10 minutes of things shaking about and a whining noise?The scenes with Armstrong and his wife had all the believability of a C-grade horror. Very little chemistry at all.Much of the movie wasn't really explained very well. Had little idea what part of the whole story we were up to at most points.But the absolute worst part - another utterly appalling performance from Ryan Gosling. He really needs to take up golf, and leave the entertainment business behind. He was dreadful in every way. No emotion, no nothing. Please stop hiring this man to make movies. I dead-set nearly turned this off. Only kept watching cos the wife won't ever turn a movie off, no matter how bad. That's the only reason this one made it to the end!",3,10,17,16 December 2018
Drive," mid 8s - really???
","It wasn't the worst film I've seen all year, and I can see what they were trying to do, but they just missed by a long long way, and the result is a movie that pisses me off more than it entertains.The story is good. The implementation is shite. The slow-mo action that pervades the movie is terrible, and Ryan Gosling's performance the worst I've seen in a long time. I understand that he's not meant to show emotion, but he didn't do that. He just showed nothing. At all.Slow? Oh my god is it slow.Yet I feel bad putting the movie down, because it's way better than other 'action' movies - compared to Fast and the Furious it's great. It should have worked, but somehow they just missed getting it right. It SHOULD have worked. But didn't.Get an actor that has a facial expression. And cut the slow-mo garbage.",5,3,7,2 December 2011
