Ford v Ferrari," Classic
",One Best movie of the last 10 years . Very entertaining and captivating. A rare movie that's able to please everyone.I know nothing about cars and I found it to be very good . A lot more slow paced and mature than I thought as well . This isn't just a racing movie.Would recommend to anyone .,8,1,2,3 April 2020
Blade Runner 2049," Close to 9 , let down by ending
","This movie was beautiful and intriguing throughout the first 2 hours . However the last 40 minutes felt rushed and too abrupt and honestly dropped the ball . I can see what they were going for but I felt they could of been done better especially if the film was longer ( even the film is already nearly 3 hours ) they should have shot more footage , have this version be the cinematic cut and released a extended cut after (unless there is in which case I will retract that statement) . Other than that I really good filmEdit : apparently there is rumoured to be a extended cut , but they aren't going to release it. As long as there's no released extended cut I'm keep it as an 8",8,0,4,14 April 2020
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Great movie
","Great movie but I'm just saying , this film would probably be rated R nowadays",8,0,0,14 April 2020
Knives Out," Smart , but I found it dull
","This is quite a creative film and I can understand why people like it . But to me it was just kind of dull , all in all . The first half I found was good but then the second half was just too far fetched and it lost its momentum completely , making that section of the film as well as the everything else feel pointless . Again creative film but just sort of miss to me",7,1,2,17 May 2020
Shutter Island," Above average fixed perspective twist films
","It has plot that has been done quite a bit before but it presents it in a way that makes it way more effective than others if it's type . It draws you in to the perspective of Leonardo DiCaprio character making you feel the same as the character when the twist happens. The critics that genuinely believe this is a clique unoriginal mystery movie aren't very trustworthy. Scorcese isn't stupid ,people .",8,0,0,3 April 2020
The Lost City of Z," People whining for no reason for 2 hours
",The only movie I can say was truly bad . Boring and offensively bad . This movie truly makes me angry how stupid it is .,4,0,1,21 June 2020
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Good but Overrated
","It looks good and i got a few laughs out of me but It just felt flat to me . I honestly don't know why people like this so much . Felt more experimental than an a proper movie , and from the reviews it seems like the experiment payed of .",7,1,1,14 April 2020
Room," A interesting insight
","Likely from the description you'd think this film is about a mother and her son escaping from the grasp of a kidnapper . In reality this film is actually about the psychological effects of being a kidnap survivor , which makes this film a lot more unique and interesting than other films as well as a eye opener for when it comes to situations like this .In most films it focuses more on the event and once it over its over . The film ends . But this film does a welcome subversion focusing on how it isn't all good after tragedy's like this . It shows how media reacts , How family reacts and most prominently how the victims react . That on top the great acting from the whole cast makes this a based on true story film that many should see",8,0,0,17 May 2020
The Dark Knight," 7/10 feels more accurate
","No film I have seen (at the moment) deserves 9/10 . This is not a bad film by any means , but really but IMDb standards 7 feels more appropriate. 7 in my book usually means an above average films that is reasonable worthy of praise which is what this is . I understand people tend to love this film a lot but , it really isn't that groundbreaking. It's just a above average film , unless I missed something .",7,2,2,11 April 2020
There Will Be Blood," Feels like a classic piece of literature
",Very complex and deep character study illustrating the dangers of greed . Feel like one of these Ancient Classics put into a visual form . I hope this film goes down in history in a similar esteem because that's how good it is .,9,0,0,18 April 2020
Joker," Good for what it is
","This is Tod Philips first serious film and for what it is it's pretty good . It has good cinematography and acting and it has good music . The direction is also quite good . However you can tell this is a film from someone who has only directed comedy films . It isn't bad , its actually quite good for a first time , but you can tell it isn't as clever as other films like it . It isn't a masterpiece like people say , but it's pretty good . I think most people will enjoy this film if it sound interesting to them .",7,3,4,3 April 2020
Joker," Eh it's ok
","The music visuals are good and Joaquin does a pretty good job , but generally the film feels a bit beginnerish , probably because the director is mostly known for comedy films and its his first serious film . Not to say it's bad it just feels like it's not implementing its technique in a masterful way . It's a start but no amazing achievement like lots of people are saying . It's not bad by any means but it's no masterpiece . I'm interested in what Tod Philips will do after this , I feel like he could get better if he made more films like this .",7,3,4,3 April 2020
Edge of Tomorrow," Pretty standard
","It just seemed like a action version of Groundhog Day to me , and a generic one at that . I don't get why people think this is so good . I didn't even find it that original as , for the second time , I just saw it as an action version of Groundhog Day . It certainly isn't terrible but it also doesn't distinguish itself from all the millions of other action movies out there in my eyes . Maybe I need to watch it a second time in order to gain a better opinion .",6,0,0,17 May 2020
Rango," Not really a kids movie but pretty good
","I remember watch this when I was a kid and I found it pretty boring . However now I actually see that this movie is pretty good . One of the few 'family movie ' that doesn't really feel like one . It feels more like a quirky western than a kids movie , but there you go. I would recommend to lots of people . Also 7.2 is to low .",8,0,0,30 April 2020
The Social Network," Much better than you would expect
",It takes skill to make something so boring so dramatic . This is about the making of Facebook but it feels like some mafia movie . The visuals and soundtrack as well as acting all make this a very interesting and captivating film .,8,0,1,3 April 2020
