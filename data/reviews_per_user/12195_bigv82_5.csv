Requiem for a Dream," To the absolute extreme
","I rented this movie yesterday based on the resounding and overwhelming appreciation it received from IMDB voters. I have to say that it did not live up to its billing. Everyone who commented on the movie has said it is 'powerful' and 'unique'. I feel that the movie was very 'obvious'. The movie continually tried to showcase the dangers of drugs and abuse of drugs. They do not do this successfully however, because they go to these incredibly stupid extremes that are so overdone and unnecessary that it became disgusting to watch and no longer plausible or even believable. Anyone that truly liked this movie based on its content has serious problems. I knew exactly what was going to happen before it did. People who have drug addictions may  go to great lengths to obtain the drugs but COME ON! The people in the film start acting like they are possessed by the devil himself and the end result of their drug addiction is the worst possible situation. I mean the WORST possible situation. The movie is not accurate nor is it appropriate. Stupid really. Thats all from Big V. 3/10.",1,33,63,23 June 2002
Dumb and Dumber," 6.4 out of ten are you serious!
",This movie has been totally screwed by imdb voters. This movie is one of the best comedies ever made..by far! I can only think of one that is better really. 'Is this corn hand chucked?' that is of course 'What About Bob'. Dumb and Dumber has so many good scenes that if I started naming them we'd be here all day. I give this movie a solid 9 out of 10 and I am not moving baby. That mark stands. Big V is over and out.,9,0,2,5 June 2002
A Beautiful Mind," What a movie!
","I saw this movie a couple of days after it was released. My girlfriend had very little interest in seeing a movie based on the life of John Nash. Even I was a little reluctant but about halfway through the movie we looked at one another and had the same look on our faces....amazement! This is probably the most well done movie ever made. It deserved every award it was given, and you can't even compare it to all the other crap they are making today. This movie is in my mind an absolute classic. It is not a movie you will want to watch over and over again, because to tell you the truth it is draining, but it might change your perspective on what a good movie should be. Thats all from Big V..over and out.",10,0,1,28 June 2002
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Funny....start to finsh....laughing.....constantly
","Well, let me tell you something right off the hop. The Legend of Ron Burgandy, is growing. Why? Because this movie will forever be a classic, remaining on the shelves of people who like movies such as, 'Swingers, Dumb and Dumber, Meet the Parents (1), and of course What About Bob'. Anchorman, is so funny that you CAN NOT stop laughing, because every scene in the film is funny. I am SHOCKED!! to see such a low rating for this film. And so in an effort to raise the rating, I intend on messing with the system, by voting the movie 10/10, three times a day all month. Sorry but Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgandy, deserves no less, as it is the best comedy of the year, and probably the best comedy ever. Yes, I do like Will Ferrel, because.....he's a genius!!! Thats all for now..just sit back.... and watch the ratings for this movie soar this month!! Big V Out.",10,1,4,6 January 2005
Bruce Almighty," Reduced to tears!
","Well not actually. This movie is very entertaining though. Went and saw it with the girlfriend last night and had to use the 'I think there might be something in my eye' routine. The movie is a great combination of comedy and typical romance. Jim Carey is superb as a down on his luck reporter who is given the power to change himself and the city in which he resides. In fact all the characters are great. The movie is not overly funny or sappy, good flick to go see with the wife.All in All 8/10....note * I am not an easy grader. Thats all from BigV over and out!",8,0,0,29 May 2003
