The Avengers," The Movie That Made Me Believe In Superhero Movies Again!
","Superhero movies. Now that's a name that brings to mind images of clich√©- filled action sequences, non-interesting and non-involving storyline, and either ridiculously bad-ass or plain dumb actor/actress performances. That's what most superhero movies has been as of recently, with a few exceptions. Now, why should this movie be any different? I mean, this time it's not only one hero, but six (I think at least), so why in h*ll should this be anything else but good-looking yet pointless action times 6? That was a thought that flew through my head, yet so many had said and written so much good about this movie, that I still had to see it. So, I phoned a friend, we booked tickets, and today we went to watch this could-be- good-but-probably-not-so-very-good movie. I had expectations, of course, and they were met all right, with loads to cover them like 10 times or something. Because, needless to say really, I was wrong, horribly wrong.This movie has all this would-be eye-candy action that can make a movie look awesome, but that's about it. But, this movie had so much more. It had dept, it had personality and it had a sound and believable identity. And most of all, it had a story. Not the best one in history, but more than good enough to keep you glued to the seat for the major part of the movie. The action packed scenes and stunning visuals did the rest of that job.So, now I've given you my story of this encounter with a turn-point in my life, and it really have been. I went in somewhat excited yet skeptical, and came out a believer. Because that certainly is the case. I have had renewed faith in superhero movies, because this movie, The Avengers, has shown me that this genre still have the ability to deliver. Now,I'm not saying that this will automatically become the best movie of the year overall, but it will definitely be a worthy candidate.",9,1,4,19 May 2012
Gangs of New York," An Excellent Movie In Its Own Right
","For your information, I mostly just grade movies and never write reviews about them unless I think they deserve it, and well, this on truly does.As such, I may not be much of a critic, but the greatness of this movie in particular can't simply be described in a grade: it has to be described in words.This movie had the perfect setting, a captivating atmosphere, astounding performances from all actors and actresses, an epic soundtrack, and a truly engrossing storyline. Now about the story, I'm not really that knowledgeable concerning the history of the founding of America, but if it was anything like this, I would most definitely had want to read more about in school. I'm a foreigner to USA, if you couldn't already guess it.Now with all this said, I do can understand if certain people don't agree with this movie, due to its somewhat modern style. But if your expecting your average history lesson with everything set exactly as it was back then, then you've chosen your movie poorly. This movie gives you history in a way that etches itself into your subconscious, if not the historical teachings then at least the feeling of the time that you were presented to. It does it all, and does it really, really well, even if it is somewhat unorthodox.So as a conclusion, this movie is a masterpiece, all in all, and must see for everyone who's come of age (and I really do mean this, DON'T see this one if you're underage) and can stand movies with explicit material, because it has a lot of it. It will make you sick, make you cry, leave you marked for years to come with an experience of awe, tragic but ultimately touching perfection - if not going all the way, but what does - that will stay with you for years to come. Anyway, it receives a clear 10 out of 10 from me, and it raises the bar for the respect I have for director Martin Scorsese. It's the third movie of his making that I've watched, and let me just finish with saying: he has yet to disappoint me.",10,0,1,13 December 2012
