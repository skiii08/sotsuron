Hereditary," The best horror of the decade
","First off, if you haven't seen this movie yet: 
STOP Reading Reviews!!This is the kind of movie you do not want to know more about than perhaps having seen half the trailer. It is one of those movies that you will remember for the rest of your life. This is like seeing 'The Excorcist' or the Japanese 'The Ring' for the very first time. It is as if the late director Bergman had risen again and started to make horror movies, and with all his genius intact. This is the best and strangest movie you will see this decade. Now go watch it.",10,3,5,28 July 2018
