Hereditary," Just not scary.
","I was excited to see this movie and wound being disappointed. Unfortunately I was expecting 'A Quiet Place' level of scary. This movie didn't even come close. Sure, it was kind of creepy but it did not make me jump out of my skin. And, for me, the plot and the hereditary theme just seemed to jump all over the place.",5,1,2,19 September 2018
The Favourite," Trailer conveyed the weirdness.
","In the trailer the scene of Sarah performing a 'modern' dance routine rather than the usual choreographed group dances more common to the era raised my suspicions as to where this director was going. As it turns out, in that scene the director 'jumped the shark', making the remaining historical dialogue absolutely absurd. So many scenes were unnecessarily vulgar and offensive. The overweight naked gentleman being abused and the scene cut to at least four separate times was disgusting. As other reviewers have said, the fisheye lens was extremely annoying as was the background single note droning that went on and on ad nauseum. Absolutely cannot understand the overwhelmingly positive reviews.",2,3,5,16 March 2019
