Casablanca," If you haven't watched Casablanca, you are not born yet....
","Casablanca is a movie which shows love in all together a different dimension.I have watched it more than 10 times and yet I can't even find a single scene which looks boring or repetitive for me.The movie is the best example of Love which really sacrifices.Thought this theme has been followed by many movies in last 70 years but its the story telling of Casablanca which makes it a movie which after age of 66 years still is best romantic movie of all time.In terms of acting, from A to Z it is a BOGART-BERGMAN movie, a tour De force of screen chemistry which hasn't been matched again.Yet during the filming I have read that the actors hardly spoke off screen.How professional,these days every screen couple becomes a scandal or most of time its a publicity stunt.Certainly Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman didn't need it because their acting speaks for itself.If I could mark more than 10, I would give it.Casablanca is not just a movie, its an experience.No one should miss it.",10,3,5,12 February 2009
Orphan," Please Stop Criticising this Great Movie..Its Must Watch If You Are Looking For Horror..
","There is a strange way with critics.They go on slashing every second horror movie because its 'nothing different'.At least to that extent,I agree but what else they want.I went into theater expecting an evil adopted child type slasher movie. with no character development and some cheap shocks,well i was shocked but in a quite positive way..People who say this is offensive to orphans should stop watching movies,If thats the case then every movie made in a hospital is offensive for doctors and so on.Come on Guys and Gals,The team of this movie has given us very different after a long time.Its no Jig-saw-influenced-supervillian -effort at all,rather this movie till a Very surprising ending (won't reveal because thats the best part of the movie) keeps you shivering because all its scares you see are not different,but the focus is different,an Orphan 9 year old from Russia..The story or basic plot can be read anywhere so I wont go there.But I definitely want to recommend it to everyone who wants a genuinely different scary stuff.The acting performances top of all by the orphan girl (Isabelle Fuhrman) is something never seen by a child in a horror movie.The only such performances by children in horrors can be compared to 1961 'Innocents' and 2001 'The Others'.Vera Farmiga as Alcoholic-neurotic-loving mom has given a very mature performance.Peter Saarsgard is OK too..Camera Angles,Lighting and the general atmosphere of the movie is on par for what it was meant to be..No one can conclude the review of this movie without mentioning one of greatest Twist Endings of all.I am a doctor and I didn't see it coming.(You will know when you watch it),it really left my mouth open for a while..So the final verdict is if you missed this movie in theaters,buy the DVD when its out.Your money won't be wasted,its a very very mature,original,horror movie which takes itself very seriously and there is nothing offensive about it at all..Don't miss it.",9,3,7,16 October 2009
Interstellar," A sci-fi love letter to fans by a writer/director who researches and takes his work seriously !!
","Christopher Nolan is one of most polarized directors of our generation, most people love his work while others just don't but you have to agree, Mr.Nolan takes his scripts/work seriously, Interstellar is another medal to his list of deep, cerebral and multi-layer movies.The movie is a family drama, sci-fi, mystery, adventure, thriller gelled into a script with a very interesting premise, its not run of the mill sci-fi or apocalyptic movie but again like Nolan's Inception, says many things and will interpret into different layers with multiple viewings. I will just go through the basic plot here and let the viewers get the experience when they watch it, 'The human race is fading after a dust cloud haunts the planet, all the crops are un-growable with the exception of corn, our protagonist is a ex-NASA pilot now turned farmer due to requirements and needs and has 2 children he dearly loves. Due to turn of events which all make sense later, the farmer Cooper is contacted by Nasa who now work secretly to find humans a new home, a new wormhole is the key to a new habitable galaxy and Cooper is to lead a mission to find the new planet where humanity can survive'.More explanation will spoil the experience so that's what the journey is all about.The movie cycles through themes of existence, humanity, family, survival, sacrifice and love knitted masterfully along a sci-fi matrix. Now here I will point out that being a space junkie and following Stephen Hawking and Carl Sagan all my life, I really found that Nolan has seriously researched the dynamics of wormholes, black holes and time-space continuum. Its easy to find plot-holes in any script as movies are work of fiction but the script has been carefully crafted and while giving some fictional pay-off, the movie never leaves it sci-fi core, for which I consider it a space movie of our generation, while GRAVITY was good on thrills, INTERSTELLAR will have people google through worm holes, relativity, interstellar travel for long.To the technical details, the movie has excellent visuals and cinematography, it literally puts you in feet of Cooper and his team and you feel the ups and downs they go through, Nolan used more than 1 hour footage of IMAX cameras and it really enhances the experience and is a new benchmark for space movies and their portrayal (along with Gravity). In the acting department, the movie mainly focuses on Matthew McConaughey in the lead role as Cooper and he really scores a home- run here, the emotions of surprise, frustration and the scenes with his family at home and when he receives messages in space are really heart pounding, McConaughey is an actor who has improved and proved his talents in multi-genre and here he adds another dimension to his already impressive CV. The other actors do their job well, Anne Hathaway doesn't have much to do as the film does not have a full fledge heroine, in the supporting role, she does fine and so does Nolans other regulars like Michael Caine. Matt Damon is there and its a new type of role he has done, and he really performs great out of his comfort zone.Jessica Chastain isn't used much and is OK in what screen time she has and so is Cassey Affleck.Concluding the review, I will advise the viewers that don't take criticism for the sake of criticism seriously and do watch this movie, the IMAX theater I saw it was dead silent and full and people came out talking and explaining to their companions the multiple scientific elements the movie possesses, the movie will achieve cult status like Inception and people will gradually realize its complicated circular loop type interpretation with time, but while its in theaters, don't miss it, I hardly watch a movie twice, but the 3 hour masterpiece is compelling me to make another theater booking and go through the experience all over again, its a journey, a saga, you all should experience.",10,4,11,7 November 2014
Man of Steel," Zack Snyders typical action-oriented vision is given a heart by Nolan and the result is Excellent !!!
","It was really hard to like this movie for so many reasons, First, last 2 years have seen some great super-hero movies being made in this Genre, TDKR, Avengers , Iron Man-3 were pretty good and even surprisingly The Amazing Spider Man was watchable, So MOS needed something new to offer, Secondly, Zack Snyder has really hurt my expectations in last few attempts with movie that were visually good but had no soul or story to tell.. Thirdly, Superman itself is a difficult super-hero to relate to Modern audiences as Batman (no Powers, Human), Spider-Man (Mutation, Human), Iron Man (Technology, Human) have all been made with some logic to add to fantasy, so there is suspension of belief still, but these stories don't have a steel alien, flying superhero with cape, with tag-lines like IS THAT BIRD...Not extending this narrative hurdle and now reviewing the movie itself, I hope everyone got the point...So the movie started, and I expected Fireworks, and a child who will be flown to earth and blah blah..though it is done as such, after 15 mins, the movie does change pace to Nolan's style, the story-line is edited between time-lines for character development and making us believe what is to be a Man of steel, the movie then flows smoothly till the action packed climax, which glued the audience till the very last scene, not detailing or spoiling the story, I will say that what makes this super- hero movie different from others, is that it is NOT ABOUT FINDING YOUR POWER, BUT KNOWING IT..(No time is spent on surprises so typical especially in Spidey movies when he cheesingly tries his powers after discovery)..Regarding the performances, to be honest Henry Cavill didn't have a comparative hurdle faced by Christian Bale (Michael Keaton), Andrew Garfield (Tobey Mcguire), but Chrisopher Reeve though not a great actor, but still he is most loved SUPERMAN, so how did Mr.Cavill perform, I will say outstanding as he fitted the persona of Superman perfectly, casting decision was proved perfect and in those NOLANISH scenes when he had to show emotions, he kicked Routh's Superman out of the park...Hope to see Mr.Cavill in sequels as 2nd movies in such series are now almost the best ones...Amy Adams as Lois Lane, well I have always respected her as an actress, but she didn't fit as as bolt as Magie Gyllenhaal, Kirsten Dunst or Gwyneth Paltrow did in their movies, being honest and comparing with same series, Margot Kidder in original Superman movies was very good and one of best thing about the series, and Kate Bosworth was awful in TSMR, so Miss Amy lies in between, she did exactly great in emotional scenes as she is great actress, but lacked the visual punch needed in Super-Hero girls...need to see more of her in sequels where story is more focused on the relation between her and Superman..The supporting cast were highlight of the movie, Michael Shannon was much natural villain than Spacey, Diane Lane was perfect, veterans Kevin Costner, Russell Crowe and Lawrence Fishburne all played their parts with honesty, among others Ayelet Zurer should definitely be mentioned for her negative role played with perfection..Directing this movie as I have mentioned before had hurdles I mentioned before, after 300, which actually was fun to watch in cinema, A story full of action and style filled with message of courage, and Dawn of the Dead, with its execution, were great starts but Watchmen disappointed in in its overlong bland narrative and Sucker Punch , though visually beautiful was more cartoonish as a final product, this always worried me since the project began, will Mr.Snyder give us a cheesy Man of Steel, well now I will say that NOLAN+SNYDER is really a dream duo for a super hero movie, with narrative decisions which work perfectly, suspense that is not so puzzling but keeps interest and the main character which is not just a FLYING-MAN-OF-STEEL-WITH-CAPE, we really feel about the protagonist..The action scenes were perfectly directed but Snyder never had problem there, I watched the movie in IMAX and it really had one of best effects I have seen, the highlight is the humanization of Superman, something done perfectly before by Nolan..Some facts in the movie are really interesting, though no super-hero movie is and can be PLOT-HOLE proof as it demands fantasy , but we do get logics in questions modern audience ask, like 'why does Super Mans suit not burn', 'He is from another planet, why the S of Superman then, is there English in Krypton' and many others have been explained and David Goyer should be credited for this for his screenplay..Ending my review that why I rated it 10, Well I always knew Nolan would humanize the character, but didn't expect the connection I felt with Man of steel, I enjoyed every second of the movie, so why strip stars, aren't superhero movies targeted to be such, don't take biased view while watching this movie and benchmarks like Shawshank Redemption, Godfather etc, see it as it is and you will love Zack-Nolan's Man of Steel !!!",9,2,7,15 June 2013
Before Sunset," Very fews cross the expectations,This definitely tops the list..Love it,Live it,Feel it..
","When 'Before Sunrise' was released,it was a very bold attempt that time,a movie based on just 2 characters all through running time was a risky attempt but Richard Linklater handled the script flawlessly off course aided by most natural acting in a romantic movie by Ethan Hawke/Julie Delpy..In 9 years the first movie had made so much fans that when it was announced a sequel was on the run,many fans like me felt a chill after we saw blown up sequels of Batman/Matrix.Amongst all these fears,I watched the movie but when it ended,I watched it again,this is only movie I have watched back to back so far.What made me do it: The movie runs for 80 minutes and from start to end you can't move your focus,one blink and you may miss a valuable dialog which might definitely change the way you think.The background is same that Ethan and Julie mainly walk and converse throughout the movie but its the conversation which has matured 1000 times than first movie.There is nothing to complain,Before Sunrise excellently depicted 2 very young people meeting,Before sunset deals with more mature talk as their aging with time is so natural.This is which really makes this dualogy more interesting in repeat viewings.Without before sunset,the first movie was a great effort,addition of this masterpiece creates a synergistic original flavor to both movies.While the first movie was a great direction effort,here dialogs rule the show,many quotes of this movie can be complimented in real life (Believe me,have done that).Julie Delpy/Ethan Hawke/Linklater worked a lot on the script and it shows.This movie hits you like a 10 ton iron,somewhere you will find yourself in it.Before Sunrise was 100 % duo perfect performance of Delpy and Hawke.This time Hawke is not bad but Julie really passes him by miles in her performance.May be its because she has more dialogs,may be I felt more sympathy for her character,but whatever,she is lovable,innocent and so natural in this movie.The direction is flawless,the scenery mesmerizing and music score so penetrating,you fall in love with this movie and think about it for days.In short,If you like romantic movies,this movie is holy book of all romantic movies.10 out of 10,too bad I can't give more...",10,1,2,12 December 2009
The Pianist," The best war movie ever,Best movie on Holocaust..Heartbreaking and Shocking..
","Roman Polanski is one of best directors ever to exist,the atmosphere he creates in his movies is so deep and influential. 'Rosemary's Baby', 'Repulsion', 'The Tenant' and 'Chinatown' are all movies which have a great sense of mystery and dark addiction about them but when you mention 'The Pianist', it is his masterpiece.Roman Polanski rejected offer to direct 'Schindler's List'.Though it was a great movie as well,but after 'Pianist' we came to know what he was really thinking.The tale of Wladyslaw Szpilman is told in a flowing and natural way that creates an atmosphere no other War movie can.The story moves like a storm and there isn't a frame you can skip.You cry, you feel pain and you start to feel as a part of miseries of people trapped in Warsaw Ghetto.No other movie has been able to portray the Holocaust better than 'The Pianist'.Even people who want to know what Holocaust was, should watch this mesmerizing experience.Any review of this movie is incomplete without mentioning Adrian Brody.The worries, the hideouts, the hunger and the misery of Szpilman is naturally depicted to you by his powerful performance which earned him a deserved Oscar.The scenes when he is dragging A Can of food around the place he is hiding really brought me shivers to the feelings of a prisoner of war though I have my own experience of GULF WAR in 1990 to relate it with when I was just 10 years old.The realistic atmosphere of the movie is not to be missed by anyone.'The Pianist' is one of the best movies ever made and the best war movie ever and to consider that it is based on a true story of survival, makes it much more Powerful movie.",10,2,5,22 February 2009
The Elephant Man," The Only Movie that could make me cry..most touching ever
","I have been a movie geek since childhood and though a lot of movies touched my heart,never did I feel to cry during the movie but it all changed after I watched this.I saw Elephant Man after I became a huge fan of David Lynch after 'Eraser head' and 'Mulholland drive'.I always had the creepy Lynch in my mind who could scare/thrill but Elephant man was a different case.It is Drama made with so much originality and force that it can melt a stone.It is based on true story of John Merrick which I have read and many people know but Lynch gave it a touch of artist.To shoot it in black and white,multiple edited shots and the camera angles are all perfectly implied.Lynch creates an atmosphere at the start by showing the hatred of people and suspense is created when in the early movie,there is no detailed shot of Merrick.As we start to feel his misery,we are made accustomed to his looks,now that's story telling.It would also be wrong to appreciate movie of such magnitude without a pat at the back of the cast.It was John Hurt's movie all in all and he won BAFTA for this.The dialog delivery,the expressions in that heavily made up face,and the wheezes of bronchitis all were so original that you reach 1880's,the time of Merrick.When he says, 'I am not an animal, I am a human being, I am a man', not many can resist emotions.Anthony Hopkins is so natural but he always is,John Gielgud is also worth applause.Background music score is mild and just blends so well.There was something in the movie which couldn't stop the tears flowing but there is also a message, as Merrick says, 'People often fear the things they don't understand'.I recommend everyone not to just see this movie,but to own it to acknowledge the dark truth that our eyes judge people even before the heart or brain starts to feel them...",10,4,5,14 February 2009
Amadeus," If I could rate a movie more than 10, I would give this 100/10..Perfection means 'Amadeus'.
","Why do we watch movies; Some of us watch them to have a little fun off our daily hectic lives, others watch them to learn something in history,music and art..Amadeus does both.Either you are a fan of Music Genre or not, It is an equally mesmerizing experience.There are only few instances when a great work of literature is transformed into a great movie, this is one of them.Peter Shaffer did a great job in converting a great play into the greatest ever screenplay.These ingredients were wonderfully cooked into a delight by Milos Forman.This movie could have become a wreck if direction,costumes and cinematography would be a little flawed but Forman takes you into Mozart's time and 16th century Vienna within a minute.The costumes,sets,Make up and attire all is perfectly portrayed.When you feel the essence, the magical narration takes you on a ride you will never forget for days after watching this classic masterpiece.Mozart's music lifts the movie to staggering heights but the story telling is so light and tense simultaneously that it takes many viewings before you individually praise expertise in every aspect of this movie.It has been a great debate which of TOM HULCE or MURRAY ABRAHAM (who won best actor Oscar for his role) were better as both were equally perfect as MOZART & SALIERI respectively but strictly speaking no one can decide.It is rarest of those acting treats when you see not one but 2 actors reaching perfection in art of acting.The rivalry, the childish nature and energetic humor of MOZART and contrasting cold/calm jealousy of SALIERI look so natural and spontaneous that you never can decidedly say who over powered whom.Many people have criticized the play and the movie for historical inaccuracies but if you read further research into Mozart and Salieri, now we know its not so inaccurate.But even if it is a little,who cares.The movie makes you aware of music of MOZART and gives a great lesson of mediocrity.Not all of us are talented to be world renown,even if we have resources,talent is born within,it cannot be stopped by power nor can it be created in an Emperors palace.This message is conveyed through Salieri and Mozart's story to us to learn and think about it.There is an interesting twist at the very end which I won't explain but it does best to put an icing on an already very sweet cake.This movie won 8 Oscars and I think no movie ever deserved better.And the lately released Director's Cut makes it a MUST keep for movie library of everyone who is fan of entertainment,music and drama.",10,1,2,4 March 2009
Taken," Great Movie...Even greater because of the timing of Release..
","Taken is a great movie, which will always be remembered as a blockbuster and a powerhouse performance by Liam Neeson.But there is one point that I recognize, after few years if someone saw this movie,its greatness will not be realized as it is today as the timing of release of this movie makes it a much much better treat to watch.From last few months, we have been deprived of true action packed thriller like Bourne Series or Mission Impossible Series.All we got were Superhero movies or Romantic movies, the release of TAKEN among those Genre makes it much more different movie.I have seen tons of action movies but due to the gap, I was much more entertained as ever.It looked something different although it wasn't.Hats off for the studio at brilliant decision of release date months later after it was released in Europe.On its own as well,Taken introduces us with another angle and dimension of the great Liam Neeson.The action is A+, but it becomes better with emotions of Father-Daughter love conveyed by Neeson.If you are fan of Action/Thrillers, don't miss this movie, it fills the tank of our appetite for an action movie.Its worth watching in theater and even better to watch at home with family and snacks.",9,1,4,17 March 2009
Drag Me to Hell," This is how a Horror Movie should be..Completely Satisfactory
","I didn't't watch this movie with much expectations, regarding 'over-gore', 'over Asian mimicry', 'Saw Inspired' stuff we have been forced to see last few months, I thought this would join the league too..But, The moment the movie started, I was Glued to the seat till the very climax.The Direction and story telling is exactly on par, also Sam Raimi spends few scenes on character building.Amid all tension,the office atmosphere really brings occasional smiles..Now those reviewing badly for the movie, Guys and Gals!!! What else you want in a horror movie?? I won't put any spoilers in my review as the story is more interesting when you see it without any feedback,but I can't complete this review without appreciating ALISON LOHMAN.Never ever she looked so cute and mesmerizing,she really brought me care to her character by her innocent charm.Now when we see every other horror girl based movie starring a different actress,I think this was the pick performance out of 'em all and Sam Raimi deserves applaud too for extracting such a powerhouse talent out of her...Justin Long is better off as a Comedy guy.He isn't asked much to do and he doesn't either.Rather 1/1 performance I would say..The rest of cast did well but apart from Lohman,the real show stealer was well balanced CGI effects,not over or under-done..Well if you are a fan of horror movies with some original Direction,Good acting and a Genuine 'Twist' Ending..Go watch this one,if you watch it after many years,you will definitely regret not having watched it before...",10,6,12,9 October 2009
