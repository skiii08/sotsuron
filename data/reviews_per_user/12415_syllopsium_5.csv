The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Meh
","The direction in this film is pretty solid, and the visuals are impressive.Unfortunately it falls down in every other area. It's slow, boring, predictable and unbelievable. The reactions to Peeta are severely unconvincing. Seriously? In his situation that's precisely what would happen and everyone would understand that, but there has to be tension because of Teenage Drama (TM).Yawn. It started off with a sub Battle Royale conflict and went downhill from there. The books aren't much better either, although the final ending is mildly amusing.Go watch Maze Runner instead - it's a decent film, and an improvement over the books.",4,26,39,22 November 2014
Catch Me If You Can," touching feel good movie
","Where DiCaprio failed in Gangs of New York, he succeeds magnificently in Catch Me If You Can.Touching and funny with an excellent cast, Catch Me If You Can is excellently directed and captivates. All the more remarkable for being based on a true story it skilfully combines Frank's scams with the relationship with his father.Christopher Walken, Tom Hanks and DiCaprio all entertain. The only real flaw with the movie is that some of the schemes seem a little implausible - but this is a feelgood movie, not an accurate guide on how to become a con artist.8/10 - recommended",8,0,1,24 March 2003
Bruce Almighty," Distinctly average, largely unamusing with low grade plot
","Bruce Almighty is a Jim Carrey vehicle, pure and simple. Everything else bends to let him show off a joke a minute. Unfortunately, they're not very funny jokes.He was far better in Ace Ventura Pet Detective, The Mask and The Truman Show.Most of the good jokes were shown in the trailer. The majority however are predictable, and somewhat boring. There's no imagination with the plot, the consequences and moral issues are oversimplified and can be seen a mile off. Why do the lead characters have to be so shallow, thick and generally sad?The largest laugh at the cinema in the film was generated by the gibberish speaking newsreader - that says it all basically. If you find people talking rubbish or farting funny, go watch the film. On the other hand if you expect any intelligent plotting, dont bother (Personally I really liked the Yahweh joke; no one else picked up on it).The really sad aspect of the film is that it could have been so much better. Speaking as an atheist, I think there's a definite market for a god movie with comedy looking at the issues caused by use/misuse of power and how it's recovered from.It's not that I need intellectual comedy (I liked Johnny English), but this simply doesnt make the grade.5/10.",Null,3,6,2 July 2003
Lucy," Wasted potential
","Lucy is gorgeously shot, well acted and rattles along nicely for the first two thirds of the film. There's nothing new here, but it revels in how over the top it is. There is some character development, questions asked about the nature of humanity and a healthy dose of humour.Unfortunately as the film progresses to its natural conclusion, far too much effort is expended on the special effects and little on plot development. Whilst the ending is in line with the progress of the film, that does not make for an interesting story. A twist would have maintained interest, or perhaps less time on how the last 30% of unlocking of potential develops and more time on post 100% potential.Beyond a certain point Lucy herself ceases to become interesting - she's essentially untouchable due to her enhanced abilities, and the tension derives from the normal humans protecting her development. The final fire fight is insufficiently ridiculous - it needed to reach the heights of Desperado rather than remaining loosely grounded in reality, or retaining some vulnerability of the main character as per the similarly over the top The Fifth Element.It's probably worth seeing once, but it's not a buy on Bluray. I'd rate the not entirely dissimilar Transcendence above this and friends have mentioned that Limitless is a better and more realistic implementation of the same idea.",6,1,7,24 August 2014
Gangs of New York," unfocused, miscast, badly scripted but with saving graces
","GONY does have several highlights - the cinematography is (generally) excellent, Daniel Day Lewis' performance is the highlight of the movie and the battle sequences undeniably impressive.Unfortunately this does not redeem an overlong movie that has an unfocused plot, a degree of poor casting (DiCaprio is appalling, but can act well in the right film) and engenders no sympathy for the characters - both sides are nasty and pig ignorant. If anything, the government may come out of the film in the best light.The voiceover by DiCaprio is inconsistent with his character, and the love interest storyline abysmal. The ending is truly pathetic.6/10",Null,0,1,24 March 2003
