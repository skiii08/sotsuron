First Man," Underrated..
","I would normally agree with IMDB but in this case they have not got the rating right.
We all know the story but this develops the charecters superbly.
One of the saddest intros to a film and drove the emotion throughout.
Excellent script and Ryan Gosling delivers a remarkably understated performance which he is adept at.
The cinematography is beautiful and builds the suspense.
Im not going to go on but just wanted.to say my piece.
This is a solid 9 for me, and I would highly recommend a watch..",9,1,3,24 February 2019
