The Equalizer," Fantasy diversion for the oppressed & downtrodden.
","This is just another damn action movie, but it could have been more.Denzel Washington's humble home-hardware clerk character is way too nice to be believed — tho that aspect's far less improbable than his spectacular killing prowess once he's sufficiently riled by injustice. The movie quickly devolves into a pointless cataloging of innovative techniques for killing nasty people using whatever comes to hand — especially how to achieve lethal results wielding nothing more than common hardware superstore implements. Wow, entertaining.Is it too much to expect maybe a shade of moral ambiguity anywhere here, a bit more back-story?Yet look at the time wasted having him fly to Washington to see his former supervisor just to establish that a) he was once some sort of agent who b) formerly did something-or-other for c) some unspecified branch of the secret government. I mean, does that really add anything we hadn't already figured out for ourselves? OK, we do learn he once loved somebody-or-other (I think they may even have mentioned a name), that she somehow died & that he for some reason faked his own death. How relevant is that?And what about his quirk of timing everything he does? He times how long it takes him to get ready to leave his apartment?? Interesting character trait, I admit, but am I the only one left wondering how he got that way? C'mon, don't be so lazy, flesh it out a bit, willya?Too-good-to-be-true heroes with mysterious backgrounds & two-dimensional bad guys are boring. Gimme a break. This white-hat-black-hat crap is old hat. It went out with Roy Rogers!Just one more Hollywood fantasy diversion, a feel-good movie for the oppressed & downtrodden — & that's a rapidly expanding demographic nowadays, isn't it? But hey, it could have been more.",3,5,8,10 February 2015
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," The casting left me dead cold.
","When a well-known novel is brought to the screen, a large part of the audience is bound to be made up of people who've enjoyed the book. For that reason, if not for artistic integrity, I think it's important to try to recreate the original characters as close to their book descriptions as possible. The casting in this film left me dead cold; none of the characters seemed at all right.Much as I admire Gary Oldman — an actor capable of brilliance in a wide variety of roles — I felt he wasn't able to do justice to the role of George Smiley. It's impossible not to compare this film unfavorably with the 1979 BBC miniseries starring Alec Guinness, whose bland self-effacing — almost bumbling — Smiley defined the role for all time. Oldman projects far too much presence for Smiley & just doesn't seem able to damp it down. The renegade Ricky Tarr comes off way too contrite & nowhere near rebellious enough; David Dencik is another actor who comes on too strong for his assigned role as perennial pleaser Toby Esterhaze, Connie Sachs (Kathy Burke) was neither blowzy nor bumptious enough; & the very idea of a short plump Jerry Westerby (Stephen Graham) is ludicrous to anyone who knows & loves the original John Le Carré novels. The only casting that really hit the mark was John Hurt, who captured Control perfectly.The fault here lies squarely with the casting rather than with the actors, who did the best they could in ill-suited roles. Having read & reread the novel as well as having watched the BBC miniseries, it's hard for me to judge how clearly this film gets the story across, but I suspect quite a few moviegoers walked out of the theater scratching their heads.Big books need more space. Larry McMurtry's Lonesome Dove, for example, was turned into a brilliant 6-hour miniseries. Nothing less could have done it justice. The original BBC version of Tinker Tailor was done the same way for the same reason. I'd like to see a lot more such miniseries; I'm still waiting for someone to do justice to 'Jeremiah' Johnson that way.",6,2,6,11 January 2013
The Revenant," Cold, colorless, dismal, stark, bleak, brutal, dispiriting & ultimately pointless.
","In real life, Hugh Glass was mauled by a grizzly & left for dead, but managed to drag himself back to a frontier outpost. The cinematic handling of the story in Revenant, however, is straight out of Cormac McCarthy: heavy-handed with funereal music & gray-scale tones throughout, creating an overall impression that the sun rarely ever shone in those mountains in those times. Just watching it becomes a test of endurance. Cold, colorless, dismal, stark, bleak, brutal, dispiriting & ultimately pointless. Perhaps that was how these men actually lived their lives? Maybe that's the point? If there is one?At the end of the film, we're left not even knowing whether Glass, after exacting vengeance on the man who killed his son, lives or dies himself. Or perhaps that doesn't matter? Perhaps none of it matters? Ptui! Worst film I've watched since Deadman.",1,123,231,17 February 2016
Legends of the Fall," Moved me like no film I've seen in a long damn time!
","I watch a lot of movies & I can't remember the last time a film held me so spellbound. Not only are the characters engaging & vividly portrayed by an excellent cast, the subtle dynamics of their interactions are portrayed with inspired undertone & nuance. Star billing or even an Oscar should also have been awarded to the spectacularly beautiful scenery of Montana for the vast majesty it bestowed.This complex saga of love, grief & loyalty is narrated with stark simplicity by old Stab, long-time friend to retired Colonel Ludlow & his 3 sons: staid Alfred, the eldest ('old even for his years'); idealistic Samuel, the youngest ('There was nothing these brothers would not do for him.'); & wild Tristan ('Such people become crazy or they become legends.'). The conflict between Ludlow's fiercely anti-government anti-war stance & his sons' determination to do what they see as their duty is but a small part of the story; the heart of the tale is the rift that threatens the mutual devotion of these 3 loyal brothers as they all come to love the same woman. 'She was not to blame,' Stab tells us, 'She was like the ice that freezes in the rock and splits it apart.'A tragic tale, yes; heartbreaking at times, but never boring. Every time I felt certain I knew what was coming next, the plot took another unexpected turn & I sat there riveted, softly breathing 'Wow!' now & again into the darkness. This film immediately became one of my all-time favorites; I've watched it half a dozen times since then & its scope & power never fail to move me.",10,279,330,23 March 2004
The Favourite," A movie in search of an ending
","The trailer for The Favourite is misleading, stringing together all the fun bits to create the impression of a light-hearted drawing-room comedy, whereas the film itself was something else. Not that it wasn't good, mind you; aside from its obscure overlong ending, it was ok.In the early 1700s, Abigail (Emma Stone), a young former aristocrat whose station in life has fallen, applies for work in the court of Queen Anne. She begins in the scullery, but soon becomes a lady-in-waiting to the powerful Lady Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough (Rachel Weisz). The domineering Sarah, Queen Anne's lover & trusted advisor, more often than not sits in for the ailing Anne & in effect rules in her stead. Meanwhile, Abigail, endears herself to Anne by soothing her gouty leg with a rustic herbal remedy apparently unknown at court.By the time Sarah - belatedly recognizing a potential rival - dismisses Abigail, the queen is sufficiently beguiled to add Abigail to her own retinue. Abigail soon contrives to supplant Sarah as the queen's favorite. When Sarah haughtily insists that the queen dismiss Abigail, Anne answers 'I don't want to. I like it when she puts her tongue inside me.'What makes this film worth watching at all is the outstanding performance of Olivia Colman as Queen Anne. Ailing, cranky, vulnerable, imperious, cosseted, frivolous & browbeaten, Anne is a goodhearted queen with the very best of intentions, but far too muddleheaded to fathom affairs of state. When - after gifting her beloved Sarah with a palace - she is told 'This is a monstrous extravagance . . . we are at war,' Anne replies 'We've won.' When told that the war is not yet over, she is taken quite aback. 'Oh! I did not know that.'What Favourite lacks, it seems to me, is an ending - tho not for lack of trying. The telling moment when Abigail, now well ensconced as the queen's spoiled favorite, casually squashes one of Anne's beloved rabbits with her foot - not fatally, just meanly enough to demonstrate her sense of power & her potential cruelty - could have been the ending. We're shown how quickly the underdog we originally rooted for, once risen to power, becomes the new oppressor. Stop there.But no, the rabbit's cries wake the by now partially paralyzed queen, who, horrified, tries to rise from her bed, falls & then struggles to her feet as Abigail rushes to her. 'Rub my leg' Anne commands coldly & Abigail reluctantly kneels to obey. When she suggests that Anne should lie down, she is told 'You shall speak when asked to.' Claiming to feel dizzy & needing to 'hold onto something,' she grabs Abigail's hair & presses down on her head while the kneeling Abigail struggles to support Anne's weight while still rubbing her gouty leg. Her distress, both physical & mental, is clear on her face, as is the slow realization that she is no more than a helpless rabbit herself. That too would have been a good place to stop.To belabor the point tho, we watch the two women sway together in this position, their faces now superimposed on one another for an interminable two minutes until finally the rabbits are gradually superimposed on both of them till they're blotted out. So what's that all about then? We're all just helpless rabbits? Is that some kind of revelation? Shoulda quit while they were ahead.",4,1,7,19 January 2019
Legend," The very best of the Kray films, I calls it.
","I really enjoyed Legend towards the beginning — lots of great local color & interesting characters & the fight at the Pig & Whistle is one of the jolliest I've ever seen. Only Ronnie Kray could have been maniacal enough to convince a whole bar full of hard cases intent on serious mischief that: a) he'd brought along two pistols to what he reckoned to be a shootout, b) he'd get so infuriated that the other side was armed with nothing more than iron pipes & the like & c) he'd forget about his twin brother & stalk off in sheer indignation.It was far less enjoyable, tho no less brilliant, later on when it all turned dark & nasty. I'm sure it must have felt much like that to the Krays too, watching their lives spin out of control.Tom Hardy did a brilliant job portraying both twins; I had to keep reminding myself this was the same actor, all the while marveling at his versatility. His characterization of violently schizoid Ronnie was admirably nuanced. Making him hateful would have been so so easy, but half the time Hardy had you feeling sorry for the poor daft bugger. Brilliant. The very best of the Kray films, I calls it.",8,0,6,11 August 2017
Elysium," All very soul-satisfying, but....
","Elysium's pretty simplistic. The ruling elite have built themselves a perfect environment on Elysium, a space station orbiting Earth, & left the rest of mankind to their polluted overpopulated fate. Fatally irradiated in an industrial accident, Matt Damon joins a band plotting to invade Elysium, where advanced technology can cure any ailment short of death itself. Eventually concluding that mankind's needs take precedence over his personal salvation tho, he sacrifices his life to upload a program that makes all citizens of earth eligible for the same prerogatives as the elite citizens of Elysium.All very soul-satisfying, the filthy rich get a well-deserved screwing & equality for all is suddenly attained at the flip of a switch. Nice sentiment, but ah.... How does eliminating death by disease or injury so everybody can live pretty much forever help a population that's already destroying its own planet thru sheer weight of numbers?",4,1,3,3 March 2016
Once Upon a Time in America," Great period piece. Why'd they go & spoil it at the end?
","Sat down recently & re-watched Once Upon a Time in America, the whole nearly-4-hour epic. I soon found myself thinking what a great film it was & trying to figure out why I'd come away disappointed the first time I saw it years ago. But as the denouement came round, I remembered it was the ending that spoiled it for me.The movie begins with a 30-ish 'Noodles' (Robert de Niro) on the run, hiding out & smoking opium in a Chinese den while gangsters hunt for him in the Chinese theater that fronts it. We fade to a 50-ish Noodles arriving back in NY, where he apparently hasn't set foot in 20 years or so. Then we go into the long flashback that comprises the bulk of the film. We see him as a kid with his gang & witness his first encounter with his soon-to-be best friend, Max, & follow their exploits as they all grow up to become major gangsters during prohibition, Eventually, the rest of the gang gets set up & wiped out, Noodles hides out in the opium den and then discovers the gang's communal money cache has been cleaned out, forcing him to leave town empty-handed.Then we're back in the present, where the now middle-aged Noodles looks up some surviving acquaintances & eventually catches up with Max (James Woods), who's now (under an assumed name) a pseudo-respectable businessman & politician. He's about to go down for white-collar crimes that have caught up with him tho & he invites Noodles ('the only one I can accept it from') to be the one who kills him. But even tho he now knows Max was the one who ratted out their gang - their lifelong pals - & got them all killed, Noodles declines to shoot him. Unsatisfactory outcome, I'd say, but alright, I reluctantly accept it, that's Noodles' choice & he's a changed man & all. In any case, the movie should have stopped there.But no. When Noodles leaves Max's mansion & starts to walk away, a large menacing truck starts its engine, turns on its blinding lights & starts slowly following him, making you wonder if he's about to be whacked. Then you see Max outside his gate, the truck passes him & suddenly he's no longer there. When the truck passes Noodles, we see it's a garbage truck & we're given a good long look into the back where two big macerator screws are ripping everything up & shoving it into the container.This whole long slow sequence is clearly meant to be significant as hell, but I don't get it. Are we supposed to believe Max tossed himself into the truck? Or that somebody was waiting to whack him & toss him in when he so conveniently stepped outside? Or did he just go back inside & this whole truck thing is just a red herring? Or hey, maybe it's pure symbolism, man, don't you get it? Like, he's relegated to the garbage can of history. Uh-huh.While we're still pondering that, we're gratuitously returned to the opium den where Noodles was hiding out at the beginning of the film. He's the same age he was back then, so evidently we're back to that point in time. What the hell's that all about? What a pointless confused ending for such an otherwise brilliant movie.",9,2,6,8 May 2012
