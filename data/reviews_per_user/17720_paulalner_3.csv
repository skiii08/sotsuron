The New World," Possibly the most boring movie I ever watched!!!
","OK so the cinematography is top notch but if i wanted bright scenery I could look at photographs and quite possibly I would be more entertained!! Colin Farrell is miscast what dialogue he has, fortunately very little, makes no attempt to be English. The Movie has no cohesion and just jumps around randomly, normally to show more lovely long grass. The movie never got going and dragged on for almost 3 hours, 3 hours of which I will never get back. I recently had the misfortune to watch Tree of Life another extremely arty in-cohesive movie by the same director, don't get me wrong I loved The thin Red line.",1,0,1,1 January 2013
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Mediocre
","I feel compelled to write as I can't believe the rating this movie has. We've seen it all before many times and this movie brings nothing new. OK let me begin, the first 40 minutes are funny, if it ended there it would be 10, Carrell & Gosling give good performances and really gel as a duo but like so many comedies it loses it's way and the mid section drags only to find that the finale is a big sentimental schmaltz that really shouldn't be present in a comedy. Why do American comedies always do this (Sandler, Carrey)? It's better than Just go with it, it couldn't be any worse!, and the performances are all first rate, it's just a pity the project is wanting.",6,33,54,19 October 2011
Les Mis√©rables," A good adaptation of a weak musical
","Anne Hathaway was brilliant, Hugh Jackman held the piece together admirably and Russell Crowe, great actor that he is, was terribly miscast. I have nothing against musicals and some benefit from exposure to the silver screen but Les Miserables has just 2 memorable songs and just doesn't grab me, the story is weak, especially when the bad guy is played so unconvincingly. I admire the photography and set pieces to this film and hats off to whoever had the courage to make it a full blown musical, the live singing gives the soundtrack reality, especially Anne Hathaways set piece (oscar on it's way) though the acoustics especially in the opening scene were a little weak and the film, like the stage version, is way too long. All in all this is given an above average mark as it is by no means a turkey",7,0,2,12 January 2013
