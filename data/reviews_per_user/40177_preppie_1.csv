Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Pretty good, but kind of corny
","I thought it had a great story to it, but I didn't like a lot of the corny dialogue that was meant to state the obvious for the kiddies. I understand that Star Wars is for kids and always has been, but this is a lot more juvenile than the original three. I have to say I hated Jar Jar Binks and would've loved the movie if he wasn't in it. He was annoying and I hope he gets killed off in the next one. THEN, I'll wait in line for a long time. The special effects were incredible as expected, and I thought the lightsaber duels were far superior to the originals. Overall a pretty good movie, I like the way Lucas alludes to Anakin's future demise into the dark side and all of the other subtle references to the next episodes. I have a good feeling that the next two will be far superior to this film and will break new ground in film-making (beyond even this one.)",7,0,0,19 May 1999
