Alien 3," Which is worse 3 or 4 hmm
","um be advised this review may contain spoilers!Well I have to say this is probably a little better then 4,but thats not saying much since 4 was an embarrassment to the franchise. They irritate you at the very beginning of the film and slowly bore you to death through the rest. Now don't get me wrong there were ok acting points in here, Dutton and Weaver. Yet they don't save the final product, now having  the Xenomorph come out of a Dog wasn't a bad idea, and having it take some canine attributes was very nice idea. BUT its given nothing to do but kill murderers and rapist. Who is going to be saddened by that?! I am sorry but watching a cast of Cannon fodder is fine if you are watching a B Movie, but doesn't work here its disappointingly irritating. No development no quality story here..excellent mood and monster but little else. The ending was good in that its shot well and you do feel a little for her...But the whole movie was a stinker so best leave it on the shelves kiddies.",Null,390,408,13 May 2000
