Requiem for a Dream," PROCEED WITH CAUTION
","This movie is like a nightmare that keeps getting worse. By the end of the film I felt like my heart might explode. Although this movie is done right it was truly the hardest movie for me to watch in my life. This film was packed with so much tension and drama that I had to look away at many times towards the end. I consider myself a pretty stable/calm person, but this one had me rattled the whole way. I give this a 5/10 because it was well acted and kept me entertained the whole way. If you plan on watching this movie beware of the stress, drama and psychological torture that you may be headed for.",5,2,3,11 September 2019
