The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Trust me, you don't want to miss this movie.
","Wow! This movie is so great. It suits for anyone, all the actors and actresses were great. I cannot stop thinking about this movie, like I am blown away by how great this movie was. In fact, no exact words can explain how amazing this movie is. I know it's already late but this is well recommended to watch for those who haven't watched it yet because you don't have any idea what you are missing for. I've already watched a lot of movies close to it's genre and some of them are also good but this one is different in a way that everyone can relate with it and will inspire a lot of people which makes it exceptional. You can't actually compare it to others, it's just really great.",10,0,0,21 April 2014
