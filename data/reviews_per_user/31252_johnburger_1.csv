","This film left me in confusion. I did not get the point. It is enjoyable overall, reminiscent of Sin City or Bitch Slap, but it seems to hint at an additional philosophical layer that I simply could not pin down.The men in the film are almost exclusively bastards, apart from a single father figure type. Both him and the voice-over (from first person perspective) seem to suggest you need to take some risks to truly be alive, but this does not seem to gel with the start of the film.In short, this film requires me to consider something, but I just do not understand what. If only Dutch education on Literature had been a little more adolescent-friendly, I probably would have got it right away.",7,1,3,20 May 2011
