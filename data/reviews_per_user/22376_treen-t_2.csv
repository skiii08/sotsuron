Walk the Line," Joaquin was robbed of the Oscar
","Joaquin Phoenix was robbed of the Oscar. He should have won, the performance was exceptional. I loved the movie and feel I got to know Johnny Cash through Joaquin's performance without knowing too much about Johnny Cash before. I've always loved Joaquin before but after this movie you know you will see an awesome movie if he is in it. He really puts his heart into his work. Congrats to Reese who I also love but the movie would not have been what it is without Joaquin. Reese also did an awesome job and you will love her in it as you always love her in her movies. Walk the Line will have you crying, laughing and whether you want to or not you have to dance and just completely enjoy yourself. Get ready for a movie to add to your personal favorites.",10,2,4,13 March 2006
The Notebook," The Notebook-Oscar Worthy!
","The Notebook was the best movie I have seen in a long time. I'm extremely proud of Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling's performances, both being from London, Ontario, Canada, which is not far from where I live. I'm sure after The Notebook we will be seeing these two great actors in the future. It was a movie that makes you laugh, cry and think about the people you love in your life. It also sends a message to follow your heart in life not what others want from you. I would go see this movie again and I know I will be purchasing it someday to add to my movie collection. The cinematography was also a delight. The movie score was beautiful and powerful. This was the best entertainment for my dollar so far this summer. I hope to see some Oscar nominations for The Notebook, Best Picture for me so far in 2004.Trina",10,0,0,14 July 2004
