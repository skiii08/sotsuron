Resident Evil: Afterlife," OMG! It was freakin' AMAZING
","I loved every moment of it, I'm a fan of Milla and I've seen most of her movies, even the terrible ones, and I have followed the Resident Evil franchise since the first movie, my favorite was the second one for it had the most action...but now I absolutely love the 4th one! It has so much action and fun! The 3D is the best I've seen (along with Avatar) and nothing like the crappy conversions done to Clash of the titans and Alice in wonderland.I'm sure there are whinny little haters on the franchise, but they need to take a seat because this movie is solid.The cinematography is beautiful and the visuals are stunning, you can definitely tell they invested a whole lot more money and time on it.If you are looking for a fun kick ass action/adventure with horror in it this is your movie! Best action I've seen in years!",10,66,132,7 September 2010
