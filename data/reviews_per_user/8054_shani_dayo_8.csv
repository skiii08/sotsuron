The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Not as bad as everyone says
","I found this movie to be painfully slow, but the acting was on point in this one. I needed something more though to be considered a good movie, like more action, anticipation, thrill, romance, etc....when I go to see a film I expect to get my money's worth, or it's just a waist of time to Me. I enjoyed getting more of an insight on the Characters and what they were feeling, which should set the tone for the next and final film coming out in a few months. I am not a big fan of this movie, but it will give me something to look forward to, I just wish it had lived up to my expectations. The movie looked rushed and thrown together just so the producers can get the series over with, very disappointing....",2,0,2,5 September 2015
Coraline," Good.....but not a classic
","I only recently watched Coraline after hearing so many positive things about it. I think it has some moments that causes the viewer to think about the deeper hidden meaning of the story, hence the whole 'be careful what You wish for' title on the DVD. The moral is obvious and simple, which is not necessarily a bad thing, it depends on how it comes across. Basically the movie is about a 12 year old girl who has parents that could care less about Her, She finds a door to a secret world, thinks it is all fun and games but soon learns otherwise.....from what I heard I expected a little bit more out of the plot, the trailer makes the movie look a lot more interesting than it really is to be honest. The movie has good moments towards the end, but before then the movie was a little flat. There could have been more detail about the main villain of the movie 'the other mother' and why exactly She kept children's souls locked away. I must say however the voice acting, and animation were on point. This film is probably enough to entertain a kid 12 and under but it is not my taste.",6,1,1,2 November 2015
Finding Nemo," I am being honest
","I will not say this film was excellent, and I will not say it was plain awful either. It was somewhere in the middle for Me, it is a cute family film if You have Young kids, but it is missing something. The beginning is everything, it can make or break a film, now the start to finding Nemo set the tone for the movie and served it's purpose well. The movie had nice points but at times became boring and seemed to drag on, leaving Me wishing that I could skip on to the good parts. Basically this Male clownfish has a wife in the beginning with dozens of newborn eggs who will develop into little fish, a large creature comes attacks the family, knocks Him out, kills His wife, and all of His eggs but one, Nemo His Son who He will become protective off. Then We see how Nemo becomes a energetic but hardheaded child and get's into trouble, even landing Him in a situation were He is taken by Man and dropped in a fish tank. His Dad searches for Him like any parent would, and He runs into a few new friends on the way, including an unintelligent Female fish named Dori. After this, a bunch of foolishness they find the kid and the end...yay? Anyway the movie is short of heartfelt and emotional, just simply to keep Your 5-8 year old kid's attention. It can teach You to keep going in life though, I will give it that. I have seen better, but then again I have also seen worse. It is a pretty simple non-complex storyline that is easy to follow, but doesn't leave You with anything to think about. I have high standers for Kid's film actually, I believe they should be given quality movies and life lessons because they are our youth and the future, not just any mindless old thing. It's okay to have a comedy once in a while that is funny hahaha, but this movie just isn't it and leaves a lot to be desired. It is just plain flat and stale for Me, in no way a classic, or something I will remember for years to come. I would say let Your little kids watch the movie, older ones may not enjoy it.",6,1,1,6 September 2015
Cars," Not that good
","I didn't like this film on first watch, but to tell the truth it is not the worst film I have ever seen. It is nothing special to tell You the truth, just the typical child's film that Your Son will outgrow by the age of about 11. The plot line is pretty stiff to say the least, the characters aren't really much and leave a lot to be desired. Most of the Characters are one-dimensional or so boring that You will want to get up and leave the theater. Back to the plot, I feel the plot is to slow and is dragged out for no reason, it is pretty simple, flatlined, and has no sort of complexity or anything that leaves You feeling breathless I can tell You that! I might recommend this movie for Younger children, but it just didn't do it for Me and left a bad taste in my mouth.",1,3,6,5 September 2015
Frozen," Just plain sad
","I have said before, it is difficult to get a good review from Me, sometimes I give movies the benefit of the doubt, but not in this case. Frozen is arguable one of Disney's poorest films, from the laziness with animation, to the awful songs. I feel that the trailer is better than the actual film, and I don't see what the hype is. First of all, the beginning of the film is weak and hardly tells You anything about what You are watching, I mean a song about Ice? Besides this the story is entirely to rushed, and can be confusing at parts because the story is moving so fast without a pause. Now, let Me say something about this soundtrack....Just No....Most of the songs in the movie were pointless, came in randomly, had little to no thought or story, and didn't make Me feel anything but annoyance (Yes, I even thought Let it go was a bad song) Moving on to the Characters, all I can say is what was Disney thinking?! The characters in this movie are way to goofy and hokey for my liking, they don't even act like real people! They are simply nothing more than one-dimensional, cookie cutter, forgettable, and complete disgraces. Half of the characters are not needed in the movie and their roles could have been so much better! None of the characters had a strong personality or something about them that just stuck, they are nothing to rave about, they were all just flat to Me. Despite all of these things the worst part is there was no emotion! There was nothing real about this movie! It's just a pathetic excuse for an entertaining family film, the other thing is the villain is just sorry! Even though this was successful in the box office I would NOT waste my time watching this film again, I wish I hadn't seen it. Also I have to be honest, this is the most irritating film I have seen in a long time. So with that I say please, don't waist Your energy or time on this supposed 'movie'.",1,38,69,5 September 2015
The Lion King," Disney's best film paws down!
","I first saw The Lion King when I was about 5 years old, I was hooked from the start and found it was unlike any other Disney movie I have ever seen since then. Sure, there are heroes in Disney that search for their destiny in life in other films, but The Lion King tells it in a unique light, with a much deeper meaning. The Lion King has many great point, from the music, down to the detail for characters, with some really good lessons for Your kids that will possibly help them later in their lives. One thing I really enjoyed about this film was the Characters, I enjoyed how real they were, it made me feel like I was in the movie. The realistic behavior of Simba and Nala as children was on point, it shows how kids are innocent and don't know any better, while also showing the view point of an adult, and the dynamic between Father and son. I also liked the strong scenes in the film, when Mufasa appeared in the clouds to speak to Simba I was taken back, because it actually made me feel something in my heart, it deeply touched me. Further more I loved how the characters had flaws, but their good characteristics balanced with the bad (all except for Scar). The movie goes through points of development, and many emotions. The animation, and attention to detail in this movie was wonderful, it was extremely well done, well thought out, and well planned. This is truly Disney's best film as many people say, this movie will stick with me, and will forever remain timeless.",10,1,1,26 August 2015
WALLÂ·E," Undoubtedly dull
","I first saw this movie the year it came out, and I could barely keep my eyes open throughout the whole thing. The story is simple and easy to follow, unfortunately the simple plot line is the movies downfall. Wall-E brings nothing new to the table, I felt like I was watching a documentary rather than a movie that was meant to entertain people of all ages, offering a timeless appeal. This film could be a lot more, but the potential was wasted. In order for this movie to be qualified as 'good' I would have to say the plot line would need to be less predictable, create three dimensional characters, and go more in depth with the story. On the bright side, Wall-E has morals that people today can relate to, such as how humans need to start preserving the natural resources we have, or one day it could all be gone, but despite that nice point in the movie, Wall-E still fails to impress Me.",3,1,6,13 October 2015
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Best one in the series so far
","Catching Fire, the second installment in 'The Hunger Games' trilogy was by far the best movie in the series that I have seen so far. This film goes more in depth with the story and the Characters feelings than the first one did, and explains more about how life is in the districts. It seems like the camera work, make up, lines, the writing, and what they did a did not cut out of the movie from the books was done with more care and thought than before. Catching fire was somewhat like the book, and kept Me on the edge of My seat until the end of the Movie, and I have seen it about 6 times sense 2013. The actors really put their hearts into this one, and gave off a believable performance, especially Jennifer Lawrence, and I am usually not impressed by Her. It left Me wondering what was going to happen next, and my anticipation for the next film was at an all time high( but that was for nothing, but that if for Me to talk about at a later time)and I really got into the story. Catching Fire deserves I higher rating than it received in My opinion.",10,5,14,6 September 2015
