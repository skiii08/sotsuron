The Blair Witch Project," Hollywood has nothing on this film.
","This film is by far the scariest film I have ever seen.  Ihave not been scared by a film since I was 8, but this one mademe turn on all the lights when I got home.  I graduated fromfilm school so I know something about how films are made.  Withbasically no budget these guys made me terrified. Some people may not appreciate it's brilliance but I thinkthose people may be looking for a film more like 'Scream', thisfilm doesn't shock you with gore, it goes to the heart of yourfears and scares you beyond belief.  The acting is greatespecially by the female lead character.  This film proves thatyou don't need millions to make a great movie",10,1,3,27 July 1999
Man on the Moon," No Plot
",Jim Carrey is great but there was no plot.  Funny and sad butvery hollow. If you loved Kaufman you'll love this movie but if you aren'tfamiluar with his 'comedy' you might not be very entertained. Milos Formon has done much better.  His last film Larry Flintwent somewhere and was a bio. 7 of,7,0,0,24 December 1999
Titanic," Why do people hate this film?
","I think people hate this film because they are letting the hype about the film interfere with how they see the film.  Don't judge a film based on outside influences.  Don't hate it because Cameron is an egomaniac.  Don't hate it because 14 year old girls went 20 times just to see Leo.  Don't hate it because they played that song 10 times a day for a year.  Hate it because you hate the movie itself, what was on the screen and that alone. If you but all the hype aside I think you will see a truly great film.  A film that succeeds on many levels.  Special effects, acting, music, action, humor, historical, moral, philosophical.  Did I miss one? I'll admit I love Cameron films.  I don't however typically like 'chick' flicks, and this is partially a chick flick.  But it is also an 'action' flick. Does it go on to long.  I say about 5 minutes.  I hate the part with the stupid kid screaming alone in the hallway.  Other than that it's perfect in just about every way.  I graduated from film school and nothing I saw there came close to this film.",10,0,3,8 October 1999
