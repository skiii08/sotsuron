Hereditary," One of the best horror movies I've ever seen
","Wow. I am out of words.I honestly didn't care for The Witch, and I don't get why people find this so similar to it. Maybe it's the pace. But there is something here so visceral and intense that I feel like comparing it to the likes of The Shining and The Exorcist.This movie, from the very beginning, feels extremely sad and hopeless. It never lets up for even a second. Even when things are fairly normal near the beginning, it feels weird, like something is lurking at every turn.When things start happening, man they REALLY start happening. There are some chilling moments here. Mind you, the creepiness here doesn't come from visually horrible things, or jump scares. The scares in this movie linger, creeping up on you when you least expect it. I saw this movie two weeks ago and when I go to sleep I always remember the fate of this family and get chills. It is really that effective. And I've never felt this way with any movie, like EVER.And then there's the acting. Oh my god, the acting is like a punch in the gut and three in the face. I was particularly impressed with Alex Wolff, especially in the infamous car scene. And Toni, please, have all the awards already!All in all, it's a remarkable film, that puts the horror in the grief and heart wrenching loss this family is going through. From the beginning you get the feeling this family is doomed. And by the end, you are already crying in despair, with an ending so out of the leftfield you can't help but sit there baffled at what's just unfolded onscreen.Please go see it now.",10,3,7,27 June 2018
