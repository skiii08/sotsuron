Mission: Impossible III," Thanks for the Ideal
","I really appreciate that the producer, director, and Tom Cruise had the courage to show people of many apparent different ethnicities conclaving at Ethan's home for his engagement party. How can we ever expect society to reflect that which is never put forth as an ideal? I also appreciate that everyone on the team represented a different culture. Not only was the movie wonderful(although MI II is my favorite), It suggests an ideal that all races can work and live together in social harmony. Way to go!I don't know that I appreciate the other symbolism--for instance, the allusion that there are many people masquerading as priests--Hmm, a little touchy but basically a harmless depiction. You know, audiences aren't as naive as they once were. And although all of us accept a certain amount of unreality (after all it is Mission 'Impossible')as part and parcel of the MI mystique--it would have been nice if a medical consultant had been enlisted to make the part about defibrillation more believable. I think the average viewer probably bought it though.",9,0,1,13 March 2009
