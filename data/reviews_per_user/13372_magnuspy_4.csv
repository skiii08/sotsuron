Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Don't listen to the pretentious critics, this is a gem.
","I am amazed that the overall tone of comments for this movie is so negative. I am far from being a teenage fanboy, and I thought this was one of the most imaginative pieces of filmmaking that I have seen in the last five years. Far better than Volume 1, and with a different tone altogether.I keep wondering if this movie would have worked if there had been a guy playing the part of the bride character. It would not, and would have merely been a generic revenge flick. Uma Thurman, an actress whom I am normally very fond of, just grabs the role and makes it uniquely hers, just like Clint Eastwood did for the Man With No Name role. Tarantino is obviously a fan of that trilogy and Morricone's music is on display in Volume II.The movie is gone from theatres now. If you have not seen it, rent it when it comes on video and enjoy it. Magnus.",Null,1,3,7 June 2004
Forrest Gump," A great movie... if you can overlook the historical whitewashing.
","Taken by itself, this is a wonderful movie with a compelling plot, wonderful characters played by talented actors and a balls-out performance by Gary Sinise, who in my opinion deserved the Oscar more than Tom Hanks. It is really an emotional roller-coaster of a movie that people of all ages can enjoy.However, I'm rather conflicted about the sneaky the way the movie turns the truth inside out in pursuit of its aims. In the world of 'Forrest Gump', the Vietnam War was a just endeavor and its protesters were all drugged out, cowardly, sleazy hippies who turn innocent American farm girls into dope-dependent sluts. The social fervor of the sixties is presented as an irrational mania, and conservative norms are uncritically celebrated. The way this movie has been embraced by the hard-core right wing really creeps me out.Still, this is one movie where the 'Willing Suspension of Disbelief' can reap big dividends.",8,2,3,26 January 2011
The Bourne Ultimatum," Shaky-cam detracts from an otherwise great movie
","If you have not grown up playing video games, it might be a bit hard to sit through this movie. The director(s) of this trilogy adopted a technique of mounting the camera on a sort of tuning fork which vibrates with an amplitude & frequency proportional to the intensity of the action on the scene at any given point of time. It starts out OK with 'Identity' and maxes out in 'Ultimatum'. At the end of the third movie, I felt that I had just sat through a period of turbulence on an airplane and threw my guts up in the multiplex restroom.However, the movies themselves are tightly plotted and enjoyable, and Matt Damon's performance is awesome in all three. What a pity they had to ruin it with the shaky-cam. If some enterprising soul finds a way to strip out the shaking, I'll pay money to buy the trilogy on DVD.",8,0,1,16 February 2011
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Not as good as T1 or T2, but definitely very nice indeed.
","I watched T1 in my teens and T2 in my twenties. I am in my thirties now and went to see T3 with a good deal of trepidation, more than half-expecting to see a good franchise ruined. I was pleasantly surprised. They have done a good job. There were some plot holes, but the overall movie was so good that I was able to forgive/overlook the weaknesses in some parts of the storyline. This is a sequel made for the fans, with little concession made for the first-time viewer. Thank god for that! There is a lot of hype that this terminator is female. But they have done this in the right way and have not let the 'sex' of the machine detract from the plot. If you are a terminator fan, you will not be disappointed by this movie.
