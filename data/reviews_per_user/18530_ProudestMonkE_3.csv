Scarface," Powerful
","When Scarface first started playing in my DVD player, I started to wonder what all the hype for this movie was about.  The plot started slow and all I wondered was 'Why are they going to tell me this story?'  However, after the motel scene, I was hooked, the story seemed to evolve beautifully.  Al Pacino was brilliant in playing what I believe is the most powerful character he's ever played.  There were certain times that I thought they could have edited some things out, made it shorter.  It just seemed longer than necessary.  However, I definitely recommend this film to anyone who enjoys Pacino's work, especially 'Goodfellas', you'll get a kick out of this.",8,0,1,6 June 2000
Fight Club," Just Isn't Right
","Something about this film just doesn't fit.  **MAY ALLUDE TO SPOILER**  It was a very nice story, and a nice try, but it just didn't fit.  I had figured out the secret about halfway through, but I still can't figure out how I got there.  It just doesn't piece together.Another problem with this film, is that the characters were so unbelievable, so disgusting, that I could not relate to a single one of them, therefore missing out on the very important Protagonist/Antagonist concept of filmmaking.  I also could not understand how the concept of men beating the life out of one another, then standing up shaking hands, then coming back the next day for more was even remotely believable.However, what I did like about this film was the filming and production itself.  I thought that the shots were outstanding, and the use of light vs. dark techniques were beautifully shot.  The overall production was the basis for my giving this film a 5.  Other than that, the story just doesn't cut it.",5,0,2,6 June 2000
Army of Darkness," Delightfully Tacky
","This movie was so tacky, so repulsive, so brainless, that is was beautiful. If taken seriously may leave the wrong impression.  This film is the pure definition of a Cult Film, and was probably one of the most enjoyable experiences of poor taste in all of my 19 years.  You'll laugh so hard, you'll scream, you'll scream so hard you'll laugh.  If you like this film, then of course see its predecessors the 'Evil Dead' flicks.  Some of the fight scenes reminded me a little of the 'Princess Bride'.  In the words of 'Ash', the film was 'Groovy'.",7,1,1,5 June 2000
