Requiem for a Dream," overrated...
","This is not a bad movie, but it is completely overrated. The plot is rather flat, predictable and the characters remain superficial.

Yes, the movie may be disturbing, but only for viewers that are not alienated by its flaws.  Apparently the majority.",7,1,1,31 January 2003
