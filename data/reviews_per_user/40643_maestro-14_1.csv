The Blair Witch Project," Another 'Jaws'
","I must admit, this movie was not what I'd expected.  I had figured that I would constantly be looking over my shoulder, waiting for something to jump out at me.  But, it never happened.  Don't get me wrong, 'The Blair Witch Project' is an enjoyable movie.  The actors are fantastic, and although their sense of fear and desperation was never completely transferred to me, it was hard to tell that this was only fiction.  I just did not find it as terrifying as so many folks have claimed it to be.  However, I do find it effective in one area, which is perhaps the intended point:  'The Blair Witch Project' will do for going into the woods what 'Jaws' did for going into the water.",7,1,1,4 August 1999
