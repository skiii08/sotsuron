The Ring," Very Enjoyable, very spooky, nicely shot...
","As a remake, this has come out of the US production factory pretty well.After the first scene, you realize that trying to predict the 'scares' is a waste of time as they keep being setup and let down so you never know where they are coming from.I was impressed and reasonably disturbed by this and have subsequently ordered the original Japanese version to watch.  It's a grown up teen movie and much more 'Blair Witch' than 'Scream'.  It does make you think (although if you do too hard you will realize there are plenty of holes in the plot).Basically, a pretty fresh look at horror films and very well directed with some great cinematography too.You've got seven days to see it...  (ring ring, ring ring).: )",9,0,0,16 February 2003
Windtalkers," Oh no, you cannot be serious!!!
","OK, I like John Woo films, love action/war films and read the reviews before seeing a preview of this.  They warned of the weaknesses so I was not surprised by what I saw (well not that much).This has some dreadful acting, terrible scripting, cringe making 'bonding' scenes and some of the best battle sequences you will ever see.Generally, I expect more from these actors and director.  There are some terribly handled slow scenes trying to flesh the plot but they are awful. No real story about how the code worked or anything and it is factually very inaccurate.They should have cut about 15 minutes of the crap stuff and it would have been better.  As it is, you are moving between laughable stuff (not funny) and amazing battle scenes.  At one point you think it has improved and then they throw in a duet between one of the Windtalkers and Christian Slater. WHY!Out of 10 I would give it 2 for acting 9 for action.  Overall, about 6.",Null,0,0,11 August 2002
