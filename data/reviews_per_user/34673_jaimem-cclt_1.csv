The Ring," The scariest movie I've seen in my adult years.
","I am constantly looking for a movie that can scare me and I finally found it.  The plot may not have been the best, but it kept me on the edge of my seat (or climbing back in  my seat) throughout.  There were disturbing images but some real chilling scenes as well.  I thought it was done well and the use of noises in the background kept the whole audience on edge. Great film!!!  I will definitely own this one.",9,0,0,29 October 2002
