National Treasure: Book of Secrets," A pathetic attempt at an action-adventure movie
","I actually registered on IMDb specifically to comment on this pathetic attempt at movie-making. What's the best thing about this film? That it's over! I NEVER walked out on movies, but this was one of the few cases I was about to. Is 2 out of 10 a drastic grade? Nope. This film features: a) Very poor acting, unbelievable and pathetic b) A sorry excuse of a conspiracy theory -- you have templars and everything else that goes along. But this film is so very much not the Da Vinci Code... c) '80's adventure film banal clichés -- it's meant to be Indiana Jones-like and fails utterly, the film overuses clichés that were trite even back in the 1980's d) The dramatic US patriotism moments are simply as retro and so... blah :) e) Plot is chaotic and predictable like sunset. Given that this is a Disney film I suppose they should specifically have mentioned that it's 18-Do yourself a favor and DON'T waste your time and money. If you decide to watch it anyway, please wait for the DVD release (dunno if it's out yet) and rent it -- do yourself this favor at least. That's probably the last film featuring Cage I had seen -- apparently he's now signing up for mediocre productions only.",2,8,16,27 December 2007
Fight Club," Hello, teenage America!
","Fight club is now a long time classic, and I have just watched a HDTV copy that came around. At the end of the day the movie scores slightly better than 'mediocre' on my personal hype-o-meter, primarily because of the innovative approach and the visual hallucinogenic reality distortion techniques which were sort of avant guard at the time(kinda reminiscent of Jacob's Ladder which is, I believe, older). I am positive it's a movie which will continue to mesmerize teenagers worldwide for years to come, for it's a 'Hello, teenage America!' movie down to the very last cell of its bone marrow. Sadly, it utterly fails to define a counter-culture of it own (or in fact any kind of innovative sub-culture anyway). The movie starts with setting a foothold of (pseudo)solid philosophy, and builds on superb acting and character development towards an enchanting rhetoric of denial, cultural reaction, and violent action. As you will probably gather from the other reviews, the main motifs gravitate around denial of society (as a whole and as individual actors), mainstream social values and aspirations, and, well, material possessions in a purely anarchistic, nihilistic manner, rooted in violence, puke, sex, drugs and total aggression. Oh, did I mention the overall psychedelic psychopath-ism ambiance, and the grand finale 9/11 march to urban destruction, and the penis frame? By now you probably have the idea... what else... Generally acting is top notch, and overall, it's a good movie to rent, but if you expect a life-changing, eye-opening experience, you're better off looking for the 'truth' elsewhere. For all of you new to the scene, constructive rebels out there I'd recommend Nietzsche and KMFDM instead, for Fight Club is a good watch, but it's Google-generation stuff a with a short expiry date. Have fun.",6,0,5,10 February 2008
Cloverfield," You either hate it or love it
","I went to watch this film expecting something between Godzilla and I am Legend. No big expectations whatsoever. I was pleasantly surprised in all honesty -- not that this is the greatest action/horror/survival movie ever made, no, not at all. But it did keep me glued to my seat for its entire duration, and left me hanging in there in suspense. That, by itself, justified the ticket price ;) By the way, this movie employs a LOT of 9/11 ambiance, and that's some strong leverage it builds upon. So is this Godzilla? Well, yes, and no, we have a monster destroying NYC, with the military bombing it with B-2's dropping 500 pound bombs to absolutely no effect. The monster also spawns spiders which infect you and you then die in agony. Banal and lame, huh? And you get your basic bunch of people, wanna be protagonists, who start dying off one by one. Even lamer, eh? Also, the entire footage is filmed on a hand-held camera, so if you have motion sickness you're better off watching something else, but I am not taking points away 'cause of that -- this is one of these movies where having motion blur actually does help realism greatly. Acting is pretty much on the level and you get decent special FX too, though, as expected, the plot is quite barren and predictable. The film also utilizes throwing loose ends at the audience's imagination, which I personally find annoying (e.g. you never find out where did this monster come from, who ends up dead for sure etc.), but on the other hand that's probably the better choice with these kinds of films, anyway...Anyway, my final recommendation to whoever is reading this review -- if you like sci-fi or general horror survival movies go and see this one, it's a solid film experience and does have traces of genre innovation -- definitely better and more ambitious than most of the recent titles in this genre (and I do mean Resident Evil and I am Legend :-).
