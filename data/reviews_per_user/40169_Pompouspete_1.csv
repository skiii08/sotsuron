Minority Report," fluff piece of crap
","Spielberg has lost it! He was once truly a man of vision (jaws, E.T. Indiana Jones) but now he gives us this piece of crap!?! What's worse is that is in a long line of other crap. Jurrasic Park (the whole silly series) The Terminal and A.I. The only movie that was alright was Catch me if you can. But that was just OK. What is this need that director has to make happy endings? This movie had a perfect ending but for some reason there needed to be 40 minutes more of crap special effects. Skip this movie and every other Spielberg flick to come (i.e War of the worlds) and rent something that has some heart and smarts. Rent a Richard Linklater movie or buy a Spike Jones film.",1,6,11,21 July 2005
