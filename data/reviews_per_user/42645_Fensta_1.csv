Minority Report," The new Spielberg classic
","With AI and now Minority Report, Speilberg marks a reinvention of himself. Mixing cutting edge special effects with his version of film noir this film has a unique style to it, I am going to call it his 'blue ' period due to bluish tone these films have taken. Spielberg has always been a favorite, and will continue to be. He has never solely relied on special effects to tell his story and I do not believe that he ever will. Thank you for another great film.",9,0,0,24 February 2003
