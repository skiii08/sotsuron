The Blair Witch Project," Perfect symbios of 'docu-soap-opera' and horror!
","Surely this is one of the most unique horror films of our time.Forget all you heard about shaking cameras and screaming ladies, this is true terror and if this ending does not make you feel discomfortable you have missed some vital info in the beginning of the film.Go see. The re-see value is not big imho. But the first time ou see it it's really good!",9,1,2,2 November 2003
