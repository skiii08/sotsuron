Scarface," Fly Pelican, Fly
","Al Pachino is one of the worlds greatest actors. He usually plays the tough guy, but it's how he plays that guy. It's different every time and he manages to find what makes each of his classic characters unique. Aside from Michael Corleone, Tony Montana is Pachino's most memorable role. 
This film follows the classic story of the rise of and of an American gangster in the same vain as The Public Enemy, Little Ceaser and GoodFellas. Montana's success is the American Dream gone wrong. Throughout the whole movie we as the viewer want Montana to succeed and fail. He's an awful person but he has his moments of heroism that make us still care about him. Director Brian De Palma and writer Oliver Stone made a film that broke down barriers and was not afraid to take risks. Pachino and the rest of the cast provide some classic moments and amazing Performances. 
Scarface is one of the most violent movies ever made and shouldn't be watched by the squeamish. But if you can handle the blood and guts, Scarface will leave you breathless my little friend.",9,0,0,9 May 2018
Suicide Squad," It's, just alright
","Suicide Squad learned from some of BVS's mistakes, then made a bunch of new ones. First, I loved most of the cast. Margot Robbie was great as was Will Smith who both tried to get something out of this odd movie and dumb script. The editing is so choppy and erratic that it's hard to watch at times. It's funnier than previous DC films which is a welcome change, but humor isn't going to save this so called 'cinematic universe'. It's not anywhere near as awful at Batman V Superman, but it is also it's own brand of bad. It's a movie with several great highs, but way to many lows To be called good. At best it's average. At worst, well, you know.",5,0,0,10 April 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," A Solid Ending to a Classic Series
","I wouldn't say the Star Wars saga are the best movies ever, except the first one, but it's definitely the best film series of all time. The Rise Of Skywalker is a solid, fun, emotional, exciting conclusion to this wonderful series of movies. Been as fan since I was 10 and it was such a good ride. JJ Abrams had a lot to handle, and he did a fine job ending this great trilogy.The action is breathtaking and exciting. The characters are (mostly) well written and acted. There are many 'Hell yeah!' moments that would make any fan smile. Focuses on nostalgia a lot, but for the final film of the series I think it worked without overwhelming the narrative. The story is slightly derivative but well done. John Williams score is phenomenal. And of course, the humor is on point and doesn't distract from the story. Daisy Ridley proved that she deserves to helm this franchise. And Adam Driver is brilliant as Kylo REN once again.That all being said, the pacing is at a break neck speed, at least for the first half. It slows down after a while and delivers a powerful ending, but this film moves so fast it's hard to keep up sometimes. I truly feel that this film should have had 20 more minutes or so. It would have been longer, but it also could have helped the audience catch their breath. Also we could have used more explanation on how Palpatine returned.It should be interesting in ten years how people will look back on these movies. I will look back on them fondly of course and overall be happy. It may not be as revered or as great as the original trilogy, but I think these movies will age well.I liked The Last Jedi more then this film since it took more risks, this film is much safer but that's not necessarily bad. It's a good way to end an exciting and poignant series. Even in darkness, hope survives.",8,4,13,1 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The Worst Star Wars Movie
","A 6/10 isn't a horrible rating per say. To me that means a movie is about average. Not bad, but not quite good either. Look, I love all of the Star Wars movies in their own way but we as fans must still be willing to be critical of things we love.I fell that this is the worst film is the Star Wars saga. It's the least balanced, least interesting, Worst written and least enduring of the films. In my opinion of course. Here's a sad truth, George Lucas isn't a great writer. Don't get me wrong, he can write a wonderful story, but very bad screenplays and dialogue. American Graffiti is an exception. As a director, he is just okay. Never thought his skills in the chair was as masterful as his contemporaries like Spielberg, Coppola and Altman. But he's capable. The dialogue is stilted, corny and outdated. I feel bad for Hayden Christensen. He's a fine actor, but sometimes even good actors can't get past a bad screenplay. This is where much of the films issue lies. Somewhere under that terrible script is a decent movie.Evan McGregor and Christopher Lee seem to be the only ones able to overcome the poor script. The first two quarters of this movie feature some uninteresting conversation, a couple of decent action scenes, ok story development and some awkward as heck romance scenes. The political intrigue keeps most of these scenes watchable and somewhat engaging. Obi-Wan's trip to Kamino is one of the better parts of the movie.However, once we get to the arena, the films picks up. The action is exciting and the effects are brilliant. The story moves at a breakneck speed. The final lightsaber duel against Dooku is well done but in some shots you can clearly tell it's his stunt double. Talk about bush league. The musical score by John Williams is epic. Easily the best part of the film. The final track is breathtaking.Sorry if this seemed rambling. It's a little hard trying to put my thoughts together for this film. Even when I was a young kid I wasn't a huge fan of it. Thankfully, Revenge of the Sith made up for this movies plainness.",6,1,2,3 February 2020
American Hustle," A well acted and well written film.
","Con movies aren't really my cup of tea, but there was something about this movie that made me really like it. And this is coming from someone who doesn't care for The Sting. 
The cast is the best part. They are incredible. Particular praise goes to Jennifer Lawrence and Christian Bale. It's a really well written movie to. The script is so good and clever and I love the musical choices. It can be a bit confusing at times and drags on a little to long, but American Hustle is still a great movie.",9,1,2,10 April 2018
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A modern Masterpiece
","The Lord of the Rings trilogy are the greatest films of this generation. All three films deliver on nearly every level. The Fellowship of the Ring was almost perfect and still holds up even after nearly 20 years. The action is fantastic and never goes to over the top. The performances are impeccable especially McKellen, Lee and Wood. The amazing visuals are a great combination of practical effects and cgi effects. The locations are breathtaking and are amazing behold.Peter Jackson's direction is superb as usual. You could argue that this is actually the best of the three movies. While I personally think Return of the King is the best of the three, the first part is a close second. The one complaint that I have is that Merry and Pippin could get on my nerves. But they get better as the series goes on. These are movies that are not to be missed. Even if you have never read one of Tolkien's books they need to be seen to be believed.",10,1,1,9 June 2018
North by Northwest," One of the Masters Best Achievement
","There is a lot to say about this legendary movie. It has been called one of the greatest films of all time, and to be fair, it is. Many of the great spy thrillers and action movies owe this movie a lot.
Cary Grant is wonderful in this part, and so are the rest of the cast. Mason was never better than here and Saint has her best part since On the Waterfront. The cinematography is masterful, especially during the legendary crop duster sequence. The musical score is memorable and the editing is also very good.
The plot can get a little convoluted at times, but it does not falter this otherwise great experience.
North By Northwest may not be better than some of Hitchcock's other films such as Rear Window or Vertigo, but it deserves its duel title of classic and masterpiece.",10,1,2,12 February 2019
The Usual Suspects," A Mindblowing Mystery
","I don't like to use the term overrated. Let's just say I didn't find this film as amazing as others have. However! It is a wonderful mystery, action thriller. The cast and script are top notch and the story keeps you on the edge of your seat. There are some slow scenes but they do little to hinder this otherwise great film. I easily recommend this for movie lovers.",8,0,1,10 June 2018
Gone with the Wind," Its Great, It Really Is
","How do you review a movie like Gone With the Wind in this day in age? There are scenes that are very hard for me to watch. Such as the 'I don't know nothing bout birthin no babies' line. Yes, it is a classic line, but that whole scene just made me cringe. With that being said, when looking at the film in context, you have one of the most fantastic achievements in film history.
It is no wonder that despite controversy, this film has remained one of the most beloved of all time. The acting is brilliant. Vivian Leigh was never better, Gable is both lovable and detestable at once. Olivia De Havilland is spectacular. And of course there is Hattie McDaniel. Is it a stereotypical performance? Well, absolutely! However, I must admit, she is wonderful in this movie. She is the voice of reason for the main characters in this movie. Her Academy Award winning performance was a huge milestone that I feel goes underappreciated. The only lead actor who I feel does not shine is Leslie Howard. He is just okay. He had a hard time keeping his British accent in check while playing a southern man. He is great in other films I've seen him in, but here is not one of his better moments.
When it was being made, it is easy to say that it was the biggest movie ever for its time, To put it in modern context, it was the Avengers: Endgame of its day. If you adjust for inflation, it is still the highest grossing film of all time.
Three different directors worked on this movie, and while this would be a hindrance to most movies, but it somehow helps here.
One of the best parts of the film is the amazing cinematography. This movie is full of great shots that are still imitated today. Let us not forget the incredible musical score by Max Steiner, a man who contributed scores to many other great films. The main theme is easily one of the best in movie history. The themes of survival and a changing world also ring in strong. Despite the movie taking place during one specific place and time, I feel that its themes transcend boarders and time periods.
Is Gone With the Wind the best movie ever? No. I can think of several better movies (Citizen Kane, The Godfather, In the Heat of the Night, Star Wars, Lawrence of Arabia, The Bridge on the River Kwai etc). And some of its politics are pretty outdated. However, It is an overall fantastic movie that should be watched at least once by anyone. Do yourself a favor and give this movie a shot. Or don't, frankly my dear, I don't give a damn.",9,1,2,23 May 2019
Lawrence of Arabia," A True Must See
","'Lawrence of Arabia' is either the greatest movie ever made, or the second greatest. The true power and scope has only been matched by few other films. It is a film that really does stand the test of time. In an age where special effect driven films are king(as much as i like those), it is great to watch a film where you truly see thousands of people charging a fort on horse, and camel, back. 
It's a long ride, but it is never boring. It is full of fantastic characters acted out by even better actors. Peter O'Toole should have won every acting award available to win. His performance is consistently ranked among the greatest in movie history. Omar Sharif and Claude Rains are also deserving of much praise. The music is extraordinary and captures each scene very well. The personal journey of Lawrence is fascinating as well. David Lean's direction is practically flawless and proved that he is still one of the best directors ever. 
All in all, David Lean's masterpiece is a timeless, must see movie that has not been diminished by time.",10,27,30,12 July 2018
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Possibly the best Middle Chapter Ever
","Along with The Godfather Part 2 and The Empire Strikes Back, The Two Towers is the perfect middle chapter. While not a perfect film, as a movie with no concrete beginning or ending, it tells a masterful story and keeps the audience wanting more. Some characters are severally underdeveloped (mostly new ones) and it's a bit slow at times. But besides these more major complaints, the film is a masterpiece. As with the last film, the acting is great, the effects are groundbreaking (Gollum changed CGI), and the action scenes are well choreographed and exciting. The dialogue works really well to. The movie is simply filled with iconic moments.Some complain about the battle of Helms Deep being to long but let's be honest, it is really one of the best battle scenes in cinematic history. I believe that the Lord of the Rings trilogy are the greatest films of this century. The Two Towers is a grand adventure, epic war movie, compelling drama and overall, an amazing movie.",9,5,6,18 July 2018
The Longest Day," The Longest Day
","It's hard to beat a classic war epic. And this movie is one of the better ones. The Longest Day(I jokingly call it the longest movie) is a dramatic depiction of D-Day. It features several stories interconnected during the hours before the invasion. 
It features a great ensemble cast including John Wayne, Richard Burton, Robert Mitchum, Henry Fonda and Robert Ryan. Keep on the look out for a young, pre James Bond, Sean Connery. You can't miss him. The film features some amazing cinematography and the Germans actually speak their own language in the film. The battle scenes are well staged and exciting. Even though the movie drags at times, it's an entertaining and insightful experience that has been copied several times. If you've seen A Bridge too Far you know what I mean.",8,3,5,10 April 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," One of My Favorite Star Wars Films
","After watching Rise of Skywalker, I decided to go back to The Last Jedi. And yes, it's still great. It's got issues, but as a whole, it's quite impressive what it was able to accomplish. Middle chapters are not easy. But I think this film pulls it off wonderfully. Almost as well as Empire Strikes Back. The acting is brilliant, especially from Mark Hamill. His performance as a tormented and downtrodden Luke Skywalker is fascinating to see. Daisy Ridley is very talented, and I think she killed it as Rey. The rest of the cast is quite good as well. Particular praise goes to Adam Driver. This guy is destined to be the break out young star of this trilogy like Harrison Ford and Natalie Portman before him.This film takes no easy roads. It takes a lot of risks. Some paid off, some didn't. It changes a lot of how we see the Jedi and the force. The special effects are naturally beautiful. John Williams score is beautiful with lots of new tracks and redos of older classics. This film is unlike any other Star Wars movie, and I applaud it for being different, risk taking, and above all, great.However, I can't give it a perfect score. Sadly, certain plot lines don't flow well. Like most Star Wars films, we see multiple plots cutting back to each other before eventually all coming together. All of them have purpose, but unfortunately not all of them were given proper care in the writing process.So yes. I love this movie. What are you gonna do? Sue me? Hey, if you hate this movie, that's fine. I don't really care if you hate it. I love it. I would easily put it in my top three favorite Star Wars films after A New Hope and Return of the Jedi.
Also, side note, I don't get the whole 'real Star Wars' fan stuff. That makes no sense to me. If you love Star Wars, aren't you automatically a real fan? What constitutes a fake fan? If we all just unanimously agreed on these films then where's the fun? Maybe I don't want to watch Empire again. Maybe I'm feeling more like Solo today. I've been a fan since I was 10 and I have never judged someone who loved a Star Wars film that I didn't care for. Its great to be passionate about something, but don't let that passion get in the way of others enjoyment. It's all so silly to me. Love what you love and don't let anyone tell you that you can't.I despise gate keeping of any kind. It keeps people from entering a fandom that they may otherwise love. It's fine if you don't like this movie, but don't be a jerk to people who love it. I won't be one to you. And if anything, a 'real' Star Wars fan loves whatever Star Wars that they wanna like. Original, prequel, sequel etc. Nuff said.",9,12,33,3 February 2020
2001: A Space Odyssey," Believe the Hype
","Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey has always been a polarizing film. I can't think of a movie that is both greatly acclaimed and despised at the same time. Of course, generally speaking, most people love it in some way. The biggest complaint I see is that many people find it boring. And hey, that's how they feel and I won't judge them. But I was never bored. Even during some especially long sequences with no dialogue or sound effects, I was always focused. Maybe it's the inherit beauty of the effects and camera work that keeps me enthralled throughout.Needless to say, it's not for everyone. Which I really hate to say since it's such an amazing movie. Absolutely in the top ten best ever. Never have I been so confused by a movie but still loving it. But I think it was a good confusion, like the kind you feel while watching a twisty mystery. You think you expect what will happen, and then it does not. The special effects might be the best ever put on film. It's amazing how accurate Kubrick got space travel. I don't like to use the term auteur. It's overused and wrong since movies are such a collaborative effort. But if any director deserves that title it's Kubrick. And he earns it with this film. The classical music soundtrack is glorious and the amount of risks this movie takes is insane. This isn't your average sci-fi movie. It's grounded in some form of reality, even thought it has a fantastical concept.Don't expect any straight answers from this movie. You won't get them. And that's okay. Not everything has to be laid out perfectly in front of us. That's part of the wonder of this timeless classic. Every time you see it, it's like a different experience. I feel if people have the proper context and a basic idea of what to expect, they will enjoy it more. Yes, it's long, and slowly paced, and a challenge for some viewers. But for those who want to see some brilliant and creative cinema with some patience to boot, you can't go wrong 2001.",10,1,2,16 March 2020
Some Like It Hot," One of America's funniest films
","Billy Wilder was a masterful director. The American Film Institute names this movie the greatest comedy of all time. It's not hard to see why. Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis are excellent. Monroe, I never saw her as an amazing actress, but she did pretty good in this film all the same.
The humor is top notch and very smart. The funniest parts are when Curtis and Lemmon are bickering with each other. Apparently the black and white look was done because both of their makeup made them look so ugly that Wilder thought black and white cinematography would conceal their ugly makeup. Nothing wrong with that though, black and white movies rock! 
It's a great comedy. One for the ages! Is it the best comedy ever? No. Not in my mind. But is it too 5? Absolutely!",10,3,4,5 April 2018
All Quiet on the Western Front," The Most Harrowing War Film Ever Made
","Some films during the golden age of Hollywood tended to romanticize things wether it be love, the West, the old south or war. But not this film. It's amazing what the filmmakers were able to get away with in All Quiet on the Western Front.This film, despite being made in 1930, has no rose tinted glasses. No lines like, 'well we lost a lot of fine young men but it was worth it'. Young German teenagers enlist to fight in WW1 because their teacher told them that they need to defend their country and prove their bravery. Guess what? It's hell. Lewis Milestone's Masterpiece is possibly the most harrowing and realistic portrayal of war ever filmed. Blind nationalism and dreams of glory are the last things in the minds of these soldiers after their first battle. I can't imagine seeing this in theaters when it was first released. It had to feel like a punch in the gut. Western Front doesn't care about heroism. It cares about people and peace. It doesn't matter if it's Germans or French. These characters were living peaceful lives. Not all will return.The movie was made during the beginning of the Sound era. A lot of early sound movies haven't aged well. The dialogue and camera are stilted and uninteresting lots of the times. It was still a new technology and people were trying to figure it out. However, Western Front is still very watchable today. Not only is it's message timeless, but it is so different and leagues ahead of its contemporaries that I'm amazed it's not talked about more often. Young Lew Ayers is brilliant as the lead character of Paul. His development as a young idealistic teen into a jaded and emotionally spent adult is so sad but brilliantly portrayed. It's shot so well too. For an early 30s film the cinematography seemed way ahead of its time.Now it's not a happy film. At all!!! I'm glad it was made when it was before the Hayes Code was strictly enforced. It would have been an incredibly different movie and I can't imagine it being any different. The 1979 remake isn't bad, but it's power is far more muted then the original. I can't praise it enough. It's one of the best movies ever made.",10,0,0,22 May 2020
The Lion King," The King, Has Returned
","What can I say about this movie that already hasn't been said? But I'll try. Simply, I believe The Lion King is the greatest animated movie ever made. It has some tough competition believe me. There's Wall-e, Toy Story, Spirited Away, Fantasia etc. But as an overall film, The Lion King stand above the pride.
The animation, is just beautiful. It holds up so well over 25 years later. Even in an age where 3D animation is getting better and better, the classic hand drawn look of the film never ceases to amaze me. The movements of the characters and the lush backgrounds are beyond superb and the entire animation team should be commended.
The characters are so memorable and lovable. Simba, our reluctant hero, must overcome his past and insecurities to save his people. Matthew Broderick is great as Simba as well. Scar is one of cinemas best villains. A great example of how a villain can be so in the wrong but also understandable and even sympathetic. His motives make sense, but his methods are detestable. Jeramy Irons captures all of that wonderfully in his performance. Mufasa, played by the amazing James Earl Jones, shows us how a monarch should behave. He's respectable and never takes more than he needs. He teaches his son to respect the world and the creatures who inhabit it. The rest of the cast of characters keeps us entertained throughout. Timon and Pumba are brilliant comic relief and Rafiki reminds me a lot of Yoda. He's a wise old master who helps our hero discover his calling.
The music is so great. Several songs are performed by The amazing Elton John. Tim Rice wrote the lyrics. While the songs are rightfully praised, the musical score by Hans Zimmer is one of the best in movie history, bar none. This is Lawrence of Arabia and Star Wars levels of epic music. It has so many iconic themes and it rightfully won the Oscar for best score.
It has a deceitfully simple plot, but once you unfold it more, you see the extra layers to it. The story has been interpreted in numerous ways, but I've always seen it as an allegory against unchecked and abused power. Scar is a dictator, through and through. Mufasa was a benevolent king who only took what he needed and, despite the predator-pray relationship, respected the world around him. Scar on the other hand, cares nothing for the people but only his own gain and glory. Simba realizes that he must stop Scar to save his people and return peace to the land. He has great power, so he must have great responsibility. He can't rule over the people with an iron paw but with a gentle and compassionate one. It's a story that resonates with me. I always find something different about it every time I watch it. Of course, you can interpret it any many other ways I'm sure, this is just my take.
All in all, The Lion King is a masterpiece of animated cinema. It is the Disney company's greatest achievement and is rightfully celebrated as not just one of the best animated movies ever, but as one of the best movies ever made, period.",10,2,2,11 July 2019
Raging Bull," One of the best?
","The American Film Institute ranked Raging Bull as the 4th greatest movie of all time. Is it? It is a great film for sure. Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci are both fantastic in it and the black and white cinematography is pure perfection. Martin Scorsese is one of America's greatest filmmakers but he's made better movies. I feel that Goodfellas and Taxi Driver are superior to this movie, as good as it is. The film contains some difficult to watch scenes and isn't for everyone. It's a movie that should be viewed at least once by film maniacs. A great movie for sure, but not Scorsese's best.",9,2,2,5 April 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," The worst (or second worst) superhero movie ever made
","This movie... is awful. I've never understood why some people love it. Well, Blind DC fanboys may love it just because. But it is such a terrible experience that could have been great. It ruins 2, no, 3, actually about 5 to 6 of the greatest characters in comics. Batman is completely in the wrong and unlikable. Superman never has a clue about anything. And Lex Luthor is the biggest tragedy. He is my favorite comic book villain and this movie made him a carbon copy of Heath Ledger's Joker, but without the charm, charisma, and acting talent. 
It's depressing in many ways. The plot is depressing and it makes you depressed from watching it. Way to much cgi, and it's not even that good of cg. Doomsday looked so awkward and bad. There are several plot holes that ruin any decent idea that the movie has. I love these characters and I wish this movie had done them justice. But alas, it didn't. This movie is an injustice to anyone who ever loved these characters. It may be the worst comic book movie ever, or the second. Electra was pretty bad, but at least a Jennifer Garner gave it her best shot. Cavil acts like a cardboard box. Eisenberg is terrible. Ben Affleck does fine but he's already a talented actor anyway. Sadly, his talents were wasted with the worst version of Batman ever. Wonder Woman is the only saving grace of this movie. Don't watch this train Wreck!!!",1,1,5,10 April 2018
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The Last of the Great Epics
","The epic is one of movies most profitable and believed genres. The golden age was during the late 50s to mid 60s. I'd say from The Ten Commandments to Doctor Zhivago. There would be more excellent epic movies of course; The Godfather trilogy, Reds, Dances With Wolves etc. All of these films are fantastic in their own way. Lord of the Rings took the epic and raised the bar once again. Peter Jackson created arguably the greatest film trilogy of all time based on the greatest literary trilogy of all time.
Return of the King is, in a way, the last of the great epics. No film of the same kind has come after. It truly is a masterpiece. It's use of special effects are perfect, the locations and cinematography are stunning, great acting and characters and a musical score worthy of being called one of the all time greats. Return of the King isn't only one of the best epic movies, or fantasy movies, it's one of the greatest movies ever made. Yes, this is Godfather, Citizen Kane and GoodFellas levels of greatness, in different ways of course. It never gets old. It has aged amazingly well and this movie along with its predecessors will go down in history as one of the best movies of the modern era. Honestly, it may have raised the bar to high since I have yet to see a movie of any kind that was released after it that was better Return of the King.",10,0,0,5 December 2018
Casino," GoodFellas will always be superior
","Casino is undoubtedly a well made film. The acting is brilliant, especially from Sharon Stone and Joe Pesci. The writing is great and the story is interesting and intricate. It is brutally violent but these scenes are few and far between enough so that they don't distract from the story.However, it seems a little to familiar to another Scorsese classic, GoodFellas.
The similarities are obvious. There's a voiceover throughout the film, the relationship between De Niro and Stone is greatly similar to Liota and Braccos relationship in GoodFellas. And Pesci is almost the same character. And in the end everyone is taken down. This movie is however, on a much bigger scale and is worth watching for sure. Just, watch a GoodFellas first. GoodFellas will always be better.",8,1,4,9 May 2018
The Great Escape," An exciting and classic film
","Steve McQueen, James Garner, Richard Attonbourgh, Charles Bronson, Donald Pleasence, James Coburn. How can you make a bad movie from this stellar cast? The Great Escape is a classic war/adventure film. Although it is more than that. It is an exciting escape film filled with great acting, exciting action and suspenseful moments. It really has the whole package. 
You could easily argue when it comes to historical accuracy but I hardly take that into account anymore unless it is detrimental to the story. It is not all action though. Much of the movie is exposition but the dialogue is well written and the actors do such a good job that it is hard to turn away. 
Director John Sturges is a personal favorite director of mine and he does a great job here. It is a classic epic that is a necessity for classic movie and action movie fans.",9,2,2,27 June 2018
Princess Mononoke," Possibly the best film by Hayao Miyazaki
","I have a long history with this movie. When I was about 7 I caught it on tv late at night and was interested but didn't know what was happening. I was traumatized by the violence and scary images. I legitimately had nightmares! So I avoided this movie for years. But, nearly 15 years later and I am a big Studio Ghibli fan. I knew I had to watch it. I was not disappointed.
The story of the movie has the feel of a Tolkien epic. A prince goes on a journey to lift a curse off of him. He meets spirits, gods, a town of outcasts and more. The plot is brilliantly put together and tight. There is no wasted moment. The characters are all well written and developed. There's a lot of ambiguity in the film. No character is a stock character and their motives could be easily commended or condemned. I think this leaves the viewer to interpret how they feel.
The animation is so beautiful. Over 100,000 drawings were used in the film. It's colorful, vibrant and feels alive. It screams animated masterpiece.
There's something about Ghibli films that give you a certain feeling. Kinda like what you get when you watch a great classic Disney film. I can't quite put my finger on what the feeling is. Not quite nostalgic, but it's a good feeling nonetheless.
There's so much to talk about. If you love Japanese animation, or just animation in general, then this is a must see! Be warned though! This can be a very violent movie. If you want your younger kids to see a Ghibli film then try My Neighbor Totoro or Ponyo. But once their older, show them this film. Believe me, it's worth every moment.",10,4,6,9 April 2019
The Godfather," Coppola's Masterpiece
","When a movie isn't called one of the greatest of all time, then high expectations are bound to come. Sadly, this means some people will be disappointed. I've felt the same way about Dr. Strangelove and Back to the Future. So every movie has naysayers, just how it is. But I am always astoundes when I hear someone does not like The Godfather. 
It really is the closet thing to a perfect film that I have ever seen. From the story, the production, direction, and of course, the acting. Brando puts on his greatest performance. Pachino, Duvall, Keaton and Caan also put on extraordinary performances. The movie is long but never boring. It always manages to keep you interested even in the more slow parts. That is good filmmaking.The music is haunting and beautiful and fits the film like a glove. The story never glorifies the lifestyle. It takes great care to show the characters best and worst sides of themselves. They are all fully realized and incredibly well developed. It shows the saga of a crime families rise, fall and rise again, in the most epic fashion. Im still pretty young, in my early 20s, and I'm hoping to be a movie critic someday. I don't think I could have picked a better movie to review. Francis Ford Coppola has made at least three of the greatest movies ever made. This movie, it's sequel, and Apocolypse Now. Some say Seven Samurai, some might say Casablanca, others Citizen Kane, but in my mind, and many others minds, This is the greatest movie ever made.",10,0,0,12 March 2018
