Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Tarantino Strikes Gold Again!
","Once again Quentin Tarantino has released a masterpiece. Though not as violent and action packed as Volume 1, Volume 2 offers the a more story like movie, but with a sufficient amount of action. The plot thickens as the story unfolds and the viewer begins to understand the mysterious incident between The Bride (Beatriz Kiddo) and Bill. You get the sense of a little kung-fu training with Pai Mei, but you still get that Tarantino retro feel with some tasteful gore. The ending has some excellent suspense as you are on the edge of your seat (No spoiler for those who did not see the movie) constantly waiting to see what will happen next. Tarantino never fails to add suspense to his films. Even though I loved this film I felt it lacked the action that I enjoyed some much in Volume 1, but nevertheless a fantastic film, just a notch short of Volume 1. Everyone should go see this movie, it is a treasure. My rating: 8/10",8,0,1,3 June 2004
The Day After Tomorrow," One Big Disappointment
","Yes, the graphics were amazing and absolutely jaw dropping, but the story was confusing and boring. The plot seemed like it was just there for the sake of having a plot because they couldn't just release a movie with no story line. Some scenes were added just to add some stupid suspense. EX: The Wolves, completely pointless and frustrating (I won't say anymore about that). The Loves Story between Sam and his female counterpart, completely stupid (I heard people laughing during some of those scenes). This movie had great potential to big a huge hit. With a little better acting and a relevant plot this could have gone down as one of the greatest blockbuster movies ever. But, kick-ass graphics, horrible acting, and a crappy plot isn't going to get you that recognition. Those looking for some awesome visual effects should go see this movie, if you are not into that forget it, it's a waste of time.",5,0,1,31 May 2004
