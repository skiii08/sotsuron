Minority Report," A brilliant film
","I wasn't expecting much of this movie as I knew lots of people who had seen it and only said it was okay. Personally speaking, I thought it was superb. Spielberg's vision of the future was so well executed and it never felt cheesy or unbelievable. The plot was very engaging and the acting and writing were superb. This is a truly visionary film and Spielberg deserves acclaim because of it.",10,0,0,25 September 2002
