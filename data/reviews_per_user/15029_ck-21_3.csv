Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not perfect, but what movie is? I loved it imperfections and all!
","Let's face it, some people simply don't like science fiction. I went to the film expecting to enjoy it reasonably well. I found myself thoroughly engrossed in George Lucas' vision of the early story. The un-PC accents didn't bother me at all. I'm a little tired of all the bad guys being Brits. I came away feeling that the majority of critics had gone in  with a chip on their shoulders and were searching for things to carp about. The plot was more than sufficient and the dialogue was fine. I thought the performances well done and the special effects absolutely incredible. I think some people expected Lucas to wrap up all the answers in one movie and that's not going to happen. I also think the fact that Lucas is independent and has insisted on doing things his own way probably alienates a sizable chunk of the movie community. I'm eagerly looking forward to a second viewing because I know I missed many things the first time around. Too bad for those who were 'greatly disappointed' but I have heard nothing but raves from the people I've talked to and without exception, they are all planning to see it more than once.",10,0,0,3 June 1999
Mission: Impossible II," The explosions kept waking me up!
","I will admit two things. I wasn't particularly looking forward to the film as I didn't care much for the first one and I was a bit tired on the night I watched it, but the kids wanted to see it and I said ok. Other than noise, there was nothing in this movie worth staying awake for. The imagery was interesting to begin with, then drifted off into the realm of incredulity. The plot was practically non-existent and the acting strictly mediocre. The number of dead bodies was an insult to the original concept - Martin Landau and Co. used their brains to foil the bad guys, not just blowing everybody away. My kids admitted afterward that it really hadn't been nearly as good as they had expected and their friends had mislead them.",Null,0,1,20 November 2000
Gladiator," Best movie of the summer
","I was reticent about seeing this movie - I thought it was just going to be another slashem/hackem macho movie. But from the opening sequence in Germania to the end, I was caught up in the film completely. Russel Crowe was marvellous as a simple man who just wanted to do his job and go home. Joaquin Phoenix was vile and despicable as Commodus, but surprisingly sympathetic - one pitied as well as hated him. Derek Jacobi was a perfect touch for those of us who learned of the machinations of Roman politics with I, Claudius and Oliver Reed went out with a great performance. The initial battle portrays the domination of the Roman army perfectly. The combat sequences were the right balance of blood and skill but the director did not focus on gore in graphic slow-motion detail which would have bogged the movie down. Even the music was well done, although I think Mr. Zimmer should have acknowledged the influence of Holst's 'The Planets'. An excellent production altogether. I'll definitely purchase it when it's available.",10,0,1,7 September 2000
