Changeling," WOW! ...Pleasantly Surprised
","I usually think of Angelina Jolie as a show off. In regards to most of her movies, she's just LIKE that. But recently, I think she's begun to mature.In this film, she became a character I could actually CARE about! This & SALT are two of her films that I actually care about her characters.You actually ROOT for the characters you're supposed to root for, and you start to HATE the characters you're supposed to hate! I mean, this was amazing! I mean the hateful actually do become so hateful, you feel like you just wanna PUNCH them in the face! Wow! And in the story, justice is certainly given where it's needed!Also, the costumes and sets are amazing. The design for the time period really looks convincing. Clint Eastwood is amazing not just as an actor, but ALSO a director! And that's saying a lot.And (SPOILERS) in it's context, it actually made the F-word feel great! I mean, it was called for, the timing was right, you FELT the same way Jolie was in the movie, and, yes, it WAS awesome! I usually don't like swearing or profanity, but here, it's one of the few exceptions! LOL yeah. It felt really good when she cursed the ones who were wrongfully accusing her & treating her!Great story, great characters, great depth, great development, great acting, and great message. Over all, this film gets 9 out of 10 from me!",9,2,6,17 January 2014
Fury," Surprisingly... I really liked it!!
","I usually don't like films were pervasive swearing & violence - I find it neither fun nor entertaining. Even far better than David Ayer's previous flicks like 'Training Day' or 'End of the Watch', which were so horrible & awfully made that that I didn't give two HOOTS about any of the characters, or what would happen to any of them! No this. No, I actually cared about a bunch of the characters - hoping they would make it through.But, hey, it's because it's a World War II film - and we all pretty much know how Jews were persecuted & massacred horrendously during that period, so I'll REALLY give it that. And quite a bunch of these actors are Jewish, so I could feel the tense emotion they were going through when making this. What interested me enough about this flick is Shia Labeouf's recent conviction with accepting Jesus Christ as his Lord & Savior - and I sincerely see why.I surely felt that actor Logan was a far better character in this than his 'Ham' character in the disappointing biblically inaccurate flop 'Noah', near the start of this year - where playing a son that wants to defy & defeat his father who turns into a psychopath.But, from be inning to end, I have to admit I was engaged! Fighting the Nazis was quite satisfying, the character development was helpful, the horrors of war a really-well depicted, quite on an educational level, and I notice there are negative reviews regarding the 'house' scene with the two women - I found that scene really tense! Wondering what was going to happen next, the intention to slow the film down, because there's GOTTA be a break sometime in any big action film! And loved how Logan had a temporary love interest, Emma, who I found was really cute with Logan.But I also certainly liked when the issue of G-d and the Bible was brought in. When Norman first shows up, he's grilled by another tank crewman about his salvation. We find out that this guy, nicknamed Bible, is a Christian. We see him praying over a wounded soldier and quoting Scripture several times before battle. That said, his faith doesn't keep Bible from being every bit as foulmouthed, boozy, and death-dealing as the rest of his crew. In fact, he rationalizes that relishing the slaughter of the enemy is a positive thing since it's 'God's work.' He intones, 'I am the instrument, not the hand.'Norman, we find out, is a Presbyterian. His faith informs his initial hesitation with regard to following in his crewmates' crude and deadly directions. But he tosses those convictions aside fairly quickly in the bloody heat of battle. There's even a scene concerning the fact that 'Jesus loves Hitler'; yes, G-d loves every person. But He hates there sin!For his part, Sgt. Collier generally scoffs at the idea of God's hand being involved in their lives, even though he later demonstrates some knowledge of the Bible by quoting from the book of Isaiah. I do agree with the line of 'The love of the Father not being on those who've got the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, being of the world, but no the Father.'This movie wants to make sure we know that, smell that and chew on that phrase. In fact, Fury rubs our cinematic faces in two hours of grimy, dirty, intensely ferocious, charred-flesh misery to make sure the point comes through is crystal clear fashion. Some will see that unflinching glimpse at perpetual bloodshed and gray-smoking destruction as something of an antiwar declaration. They'll see a cautionary tale of men hollowed out and broken by the unspeakable horrors they've witnessed.Others will see this pic as a one-dimensional splatter-fest dressed up in khaki Army fatigues, with limbs innumerable being severed by large-caliber machine gun fire and mortar rounds in a story of brutal, hard-fisted soldiers battling a Nazi evil even more wicked than themselves.Everyone will be right. The film's creators crafted it that way on purpose. But no matter which interpretive path you take, what seems inarguable is how profanely foul, excruciatingly graphic, unwaveringly nihilistic and downright ugly it all remains. 8/10And PS: PluggedInOnline.com is one of my many inspiration to be watching & reviewing movies - it's also a great website to view the many different elements within whatever flick you're interested to see.",8,5,16,30 November 2014
Brokeback Mountain," I like gay people, but I don't like this film... OR it's destructive message.
","I'm sure gonna get a lot of hate for this, but this flick is way too over-hyped. The movie is based on a short story by E. Annie Proulx. I'm not familiar with it, but since this film was SOOO successful & acclaimed, I just decided to see it (Internet-wise). I didn't enjoy it. It was an below-average film. It can look like a good film; from a technical standpoint, it's pretty well done. But the plot is somewhat dull and the overall feel of the film is depressing.'Brokeback Mountain 'is a movie about a pair of teenage cowboys who perform a homosexual act during a time of prolonged seclusion from others (particularly from females). Afterwards, they part ways and marry beautiful, dedicated, and loving women. But four years later, their past comes to haunt them and destroys not only their lives but the innocent lives of their wives and children. Audiences witness the families torn asunder in waves of agonizing revelations, as the men continue to meet periodically, telling their wives they are going fishing. All the hype and glowing reviews from mostly LIBERAL & pro-gay media only came out about it because the story was about two men who had gay sex. That's it!There's nothing really remarkable about this film. It's not a love story and in fact it seems to be anti-love. After some days have passed on the mountain and some whiskey has been drunk, they suddenly and almost violently have sex; afterwards, they say 'It's a one-shot thing we got going on here,' but it's FAR from that. Both the main characters betray their families & reject those who do love them.My only advice is, first off, never cognate 'gay marriage' with 'interracial marriage'; a black person doesn't have to 'come out and tell people they're black.' LOL Second, watch some of Ang Lee's better films, such as 'Hulk' (2003), or even 'Life of Pi' (2012) - now that is a far superior work. To me, Brokeback DID NOT live up to the immense hype. Sorry but I just do not like it at all! The only redeemable thing about this film is I like Heath Ledger & Jake Gyllenhaal; Ledger, because of his likable looks & his amazing performance as the Joker, and Gyllenhaal because I've got a soft spot for Jewish people.2/10",2,1,19,26 September 2014
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Happy 50th Anniversary! ...NOT!!!
","Want movies even funnier than this one big BORING pile of a mess??? Go watch 'Rocketman' (1997), 'Mousehunt' (1997), or 'Johnny English.'One of THE most overrated films ever! I don't get it!!! I haven't written much reviews, but after seeing this film a SECOND time, I feel compelled to do so. I saw MANY reviews about how 'great' this is, so I got the opportunity to watch it, first by Internet, next by classic VHS; and I will say it again, I DON'T GET IT!!! It never won any Oscars, and I totally understand why.I found it neither funny NOR good! How can a movie about war, death, and the end of the world be 'funny'??!!????Pink Panther classic Peter Sellers stars in this film, and I swear has likely the stupidest accent in cinematic history, and acts all socially awkward & confusing.Even Keenan Wynn (great & memorable in 'The Absent-Minded Professor' & 'Herbie Rides Again'), was brought in and - due to bad directing - was turned into a boring, monotone & weird character!NOTE: One scene I did find kind of funny was 'shoot the Coke machine to get coins out' - he does, and a little slapstick where the juice sprays out on his face. hat did get a chuckle out of me - but hey, even the worst movies can entertaining at one or two parts.James Ear Jones??? Eh... he did okay. Still in a bad movie.The war room scenes are long, drawn-out, and tedious, and the scenes in the airplane are repetitive and BORING!!! What is 'so good' about this movie??? If it's all about the 'direction', it certainly a direction that's entertaining or appeal to a general audience! And I'm definitely *never* recommending or showing this movie to anybody I know!Someone please tell me, am I missing something here???????Stanley Kubrick, very gifted, but used his gifts the totally wrong way for the totally wrong things. And just by LOOKING at him, you could tell his films were disturbing or antisocial. He looks like a serial killer!!!PS: If you want a good 'George C. Scott' film, watch 'Rescuers Down Under' (1990), a Disney classic.",4,3,12,12 September 2014
Lost in Translation," happy 10th anniversary? ......I DON'T THINK SO!
","(NOTE: This review is coming from someone who's actually LIVED in Japan their whole life - and my translating is just okay)Groundhog Day >>>>>>>>>>>>>> Lost In TranslationThat's a MUCH better film you ought to be checking out right now, with meaning and entertainment. This film was WAY over-hyped by the Nostalgia Critic (lulz). I don't care if so many critics liked this film; I don't care if Scarlett Johansen is mostly known for this film! It is surely one of the most boring and undeveloped films I've seen!If you aren't feeling very lonely right now, you very well may by the time you've finished reading this review. For it is the review of a movie that woos, romances and longs after loneliness. A movie that is capable of reaching down inside the most gregarious, convivial person in the world and drawing to the surface a kernel of desperate detachment.Bob is an over-the-hill, middle-aged movie star who relies on his accumulated fame to keep him in the money through retirement. He's in Tokyo to earn $2 million for shooting a whiskey commercial. Charlotte is a young college graduate, recently married and tagging along with her photographer husband on a business trip. Both wind up at the Park Hyatt Tokyo, with lots of time on their hands and no one to share it with. After 25 years, Bob's marriage is shaky, suffering from his frequent absences. After two years, Charlotte's not sure who it is she married, or why. Both are tired. Bored. Lonely. And emotionally fragile. So when they meet, there's an instant connection. Age and social status (or even marital status, for that matter) seem irrelevant as the two cradle drinks at the hotel bar, share lunches, midnight parties and 4 a.m. heart-to-hearts.Director Sophia Coppola (Francis Ford's daughter) draws on her own experiences in Tokyo to bring it to life, but effortlessly. Bob and Charlotte's collective pensiveness and dislocation is backlit by the Japanese capital's freneticism. And the contrast is used to good effect. Racing elevated trains, throngs of pedestrians, flashing neon signs, and the din of bad karaoke don't neutralize the angst, they accentuate, and exacerbate it to the point that its nearly tangible.Bill Murray has always had a melancholy streak. But he typically uses it as a foil for his humor. Here, he wears it on his sleeve, refusing to duck and cover behind mirth and frivolity. And in doing so he delivers the performance of a lifetime. His on-screen companion, Scarlett Johanssen (The Man Who Wasn't There, The Horse Whisperer), easily keeps pace, allowing onlookers a riveting glimpse of the tragedy that occurs when youthful energy and enthusiasm crash into directionlessness and amorality.If one refuses to give in to the movie's moodiness, it becomes merely a dim documentary of two individuals' plodding trips to Tokyo; They eat, they go for walks, they gaze out over the city from their generic hotel rooms, etc. Indeed, eliminate emotion from the equation and 'Lost in Translation' stops working in ANY language. But it's impossible to separate what's happening on-screen with what happens in your heart. And that is what has made this movie a critic's darling. It's also the pit it falls into while the crowds are obliviously cheering. Because of those strong emotions racing back and forth between projected image and human heart, moviegoers will find themselves relishing the connection and bond they see 'innocently' forming between Bob and Charlotte. You're compelled to desire their happiness, and the only way they'll ever be happy, you become convinced, is for them to be together. Never mind that that would mean the destruction of two separate families. Sucked in to the moment, it's easy not to care.This film also includes mumbo-jumbo about our souls picking our path through life before we are born. And it's awful that they had to include disgusting & demonic Shintoist and Buddhist references and shrines into the film; that's ultimately when the film jumped the shark for me. The people invented this false cults and religions are FAR beyond superstitious and need to have their heads examined.Hollywood gets a lot of things wrong, and wants to make you believe their films are based on reality; well think again! Hollywood has become more HollyWEIRD these days!And a little bit of useful information of history for you foreigners wishing to visit Japan: People in Osaka are a lot more foregoing, optimistic, extroverted, sociable, kind, lighthearted, & entertaining than people in Tokyo. Because back during the Edo Period, Osaka was mostly filled with merchants, while Tokyo was mostly filled with samurai warriors; so the historical personalities are still somewhat existent in their current state. Just thought I'd throw that out for you people, because I do think Tokyo is one of the most cliché'd cities in the world to visit.3/10PS: Sophia's a hack",3,3,9,4 November 2014
The Godfather: Part II," happy 40th anniversary... NOT!
","And I write review based off the ENTIRE Godfather series. I may be in the minority, but I simply don't understand the hype all about these movies!!! Perhaps the most overrated trilogy ever. I really do believe so much of this hype & attention should be given to some other much BETTER films, like 'Iron Will', which was a true story. Or the 'Great Escape', another true story! Maybe it's just evident how much of a FETISH Hollywood has for violence, blood, gore, sexual innuendos, and bad language! That's NO 'ART', you can trust me! I'm not much of a fan of Al Pacino, nor any of the work he has done - he just always seems to come off as scary & abusive (with his scary eyes & unpredictable attitudes.) Couldn't Al Pacino take up a KINDER character role here and there sometime soon???The film was a mess, and so was it's sequels! Everything is shot in the dark, most scenes are often times really boring, and half the time you can't understand what the characters are saying 'cause they're speaking in *freaking* Italian!! And don't forget the horrendous false cult of Catholicism especially being depicted on-screen; Catholics are DUPED. They worship idols, believe in a false Jesus, and are only all just about idolatry, bigotry, and superstition. Though to be fair, I did like seeing Robert De Niro here and there, and I liked some of the talk concerning Israel & the Jewish people - because I have quite a soft spot for Jews, because they have literally got a long sad history of persecution, and deserve to be recognised for their incredible genius minds and intelligence.But in the end, that really doesn't matter in a huge porous abomination nonsensical pile of worthless nothing that is this movie! And the other two. 2/10PS: Everyone's saying 'the Godfather' is the greatest film of all time. Nope, they're wrong! It's Groundhog Day! THAT film probably deserves the #2 spot on the Top 250 on IMDb.",2,6,22,11 November 2014
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Stop making these movies!! Evolution is a fairy tale for grownups!!!
","(NOTE: I'm no troll - I've loved watching movies since I was little, I love acting, and likely start joining the acting business very soon.) The X-Men series may be the most overrated & over-hyped series of all time - and I don't think that statement is much of an exaggeration.It doesn't matter what kind of cool action, special effects, or great acting there is in this queer sci-fi flick. A lot of talent, big Hollywood names (even a few annoying ones), and tons of money are wasted! All duped by a HUGE LIE (ie. Darwinian evolution) - making a story centered around that is one HECK of a mistake!The fact is, evolution is NOT 'scientific'! It's a carefully protected state religion, surviving only on tax dollars! It has nothing to do with Science as much as beer has nothing to do with sports. Nobody should pay to have their children be lied to in school. By teaching kids there is no Creator & that we all came from primitives is the same as teaching the earth is flat! They're not getting 'educated', but getting INDOCTRINATED! Did you know, today they're calling us 'homo sapien sapien' - the word 'sapien' means 'wise'. So today, we're the wise, wise man! That's interesting. The Bible says, 'Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools.' Now if you believe your ancestors were a monkey, you're a fool.And the Neanderthals were nothing more than perfectly normal , well-advanced in age, with diseases (ie. arthritis). But even those evidences like these have been proved wrong over 50 years ago, they STILL remain in the textbooks! And no doubt the creators and cast of this film have been DUPED by these lies! Almost every single chance this film gets, evolution tries gets SHOVED at us, and it takes me out of this film - it's so bad that it OVERWHELMS the good stuff. Trust me that's really going to dumb a whole generation down. Evolution didn't launch us into space - it was rocket science! Nearly all branches of Science were created by biblical creationists (Isaac Newton, Werner Von Braun, Francis Bacon, Louis Pasteur, etc). Darwin was not a 'scientist' - he was one of the greatest speculators of all time; he always made up stories when he was young! Like Hitler said, 'People are more likely to believe a BIG lie than a small one.' And plus, he looked like the saddest looking man I had ever seen in my life. Long story short, my advice is just go watch Dr. Kent Hovind's Science seminars on YouTube - one person can learn more 'Science' from this guy than their whole life at school... sadly.Also, mutations are only HARMFUL, and only cause suffering & death! They NEVER 'cause superpowers! Whoever thought of such a thing clearly have to get their head examined. And all the invented plot holes of people being 'racist' or 'intolerant' of 'mutants' has gotten quite annoying! Trust me, in a godly Christian worldview, there would be love & acceptance all around.Sadly, the big 'MARVEL' guy himself, Stan Lee, is Jewish. I love Jewish people, they have turned out to be extremely smart & intelligent people; I've got a huge soft spot for them, because their history, their identity, their heritage, etc., everything about them is special. But there can be a lot of people born into this world with a God-given intelligence, but can use their intelligence the totally wrong way for the totally wrong things. (i.e. Stanley Kubrick, Lenny Bruce, George Carlin, Richard Dawkins, etc.) I'm not saying, I 'hate' Marvel. I LOVED the Avengers - a miracle of a film! I just dislike it when the religious unscientific theory of evolution is so horrendously tried to be shoved in our faces. You have to learn early in life to 'eat the meat & spit out the bones' or you're'll to choke on something.And the annoying cast members also really take me out of this film, as soon as they make their on-screen appearances. Ellen Page - quite possibly the worst actress since the 'rape victim' in 'How To Kill a Mockingbird,' and always acts dumb as a brick. Seriously, all the against from Gwyneth Paltrow should be re-directed at her instead! Miss Lawrence is WAY TOO over hyped & fails to play any character we can care about - and in the hopes will make us forget about hating her in being distracted by all the 'fan service' she tries to give with her curvy bod. I have to say, when I saw the 'Hunger Games', at first I thought she was the new Cate Blanchett. I was wrong, I passionately dislike her now; she shot herself in the foot. Patrick Stewart, no matter how 'cool' a voice he has, really has been duped, and always talks about 'mutants', when the actor himself is CLEARLY oblivious to the huge amount of lies, bias, fallacies, and falsified 'evidence' it's based upon! Not to mention instead, the overwhelming evidence for special Creation, evidence of worldwide flooding on this planet, dinosaurs being the 'dragons' throughout history & still being alive! (Same goes for Ian McKellen - though his LOTR films are better, since I can't see him as a villain!) And that goes for the REST of the cast members, especially the director of this film! They're all so sadly uninformed & uneducated in this huge vital area.Our origins are not a 'side issue' – they're vitally IMPORTANT! But to be fair, this story is decent on its own with no context.And this film being set in a Buddhist monastery truly shows the immense bias Hollywood has against Christianity, & favoring Eastern religions.PS: Am I the only one who thinks James McAvoy & Michael Fassbender (ugh) look NOTHING like their counterparts?? 1/10",2,4,26,23 October 2014
Wreck-It Ralph," 'Wreck-It Ralph' smashes 'Brave' to pieces!!
","Brave sucks BEAR NOSES! Take home that Oscar, Wreck-It Ralph!I just re-watched this film with some friends (who had never seen it before) and I was reminded of how much I loved it! My friends found it pleasantly surprising too! They loved how it was a universe of video game characters that came & gathered together,much like 'Toy Story'. Even with many fictional games being created for the film was quite a talented thing to do! I never thought of it that way before! The villain was interesting, the plot was smart, the jokes were just TOO funny, and all the characters were just all-round likable without being too over-the-top. And that Owl City song at the end certainly was the icing on the cake!How the flying FRIDGE does an unlikable & unoriginal film (Brave) beat a funnier, smarter, enjoyable, touching, & better original film???'Brave' was so silly, so rushed, so uncomfortable & cringe-worthy & stressful - I can't even remember anything likable about it. Though to be fair, I will say Merida from Brave might LOOK like a creative & interesting princess, but the story was just a MESS! Plus, it's quite hysterical that if the rules apply, if Merida shot all the arrows and won against the others (even in slo-mo. I know, wut??), wouldn't that mean should would have to marry herself?? lol (Hey, 'The Little Mermaid 2' explored the daughter-mother concept better than 'Brave'.)I call it completely COWARD-like of the Academy to perform this action of giving the Oscar to the WRONG movie! Did they even SEE the same movie I did!?? Put ME on the Academy - I'm sure I could do things a whole lot better.(And no, I'm not one of those who think that 'Leonardo DiCaprio deserves an Oscar' - c'mon, I have a whole page dedicated to talking about male celebrities who're SO MUCH hotter & talented than him. He doesn't deserve to get a majority of the praise for playing the same shouting, foul- mouthed, insecure, degenerate in so many darn movies! And seriously, his talent really is just limited to shouting)Anyways, I'm SO excited this movie exists, it's a great nostalgia trip to anyone who grew up playing video games, and that 'Wreck-It Ralph 2' is in the works! 'Brave 2' better not steal the Oscar this time! lolGlad 'Frozen' won the Oscar Disney SHOULD have for Wreck-It Ralph.9/10PS: Not also do I like this film for introducing me to the talented Sarah Silverman, but the actress herself is Jewish! And I've got quite soft spot for Jewish people - and I never did find her character, Vanellope von Schweetz, at all annoying (like my sisters did). She was just TOO cute, funny, and likable!",9,2,6,6 December 2014
Django Unchained," Seemed interesting, but Leonardo DiCaprio ruined it for me!!
","I like films about ending slavery & equality amongst human beings, black or white, but their are MUCH better flick than this overrated schlock! (ie. Places In the Heart, Lincoln, Ruby Bridges, etc)He's just about ruined every movie I've seen him in it. In my view, DiCaprio isn't very original - he is at most an amateur & overrated actor. Same tone. Same face. Same expression, NOTHING! - No matter what people or Hollywood say. I can't take him seriously in basically ANY role he's in, not even when he uses a ridiculous accent or wears hilariously bad makeup (even though he looks like a 15 year-old girl).(And I'm GLAD he's not playing Steve Jobs; I mean, does he have to play *every single person* throughout history???)In hindsight, DiCaprio's talent really is just limited to screaming & shouting - I'm not joking!There're some exceptions to the rule of course, but most child actors grow up to be talentless hacks (ie. Macaulay Culkin, Haley Joel Osmit, Edward Furlong, Gary Coleman, Corey Feldman, etc). And I'm certain that also includes DiCaprio.I'm not surprised he hasn't won an Oscar - if he did, I'd be really disappointed. Actually, *I* would give him an Award for 'Most Overrated Actor' of all time.(I believe he should've retired after 'Titanic'.) He doesn't deserve a majority of the praise he gets for playing the same spoilt, whiny, degenerate, antisocial, insecure, repressive, foul-mouthed, sinful, condescending character in so many damn movies... Couldn't he try playing a more unflappable character soon?? (One who doesn't LOSE THEIR S*** at the drop of a hat!?) Long story short, just watch this YouTube video to understand: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31UUGLbkDLgBut in the end, all of this is just opinion-based.PS: Though to be fair, Tarintino's got some interesting soundtrack taste, and Christopher Waltz was the best performance in this flick as the best character, hands down, no contest.",2,3,15,13 November 2014
Drive," Boring, Boring, ...and MORE Boring!
","Just going by the reviews, this movie became a giant LETDOWN for me! First off, I'm a film snob, yes. I watch A LOT of movies, and for sake of argument, I know a lot more movies that are a lot more entertaining & make more sense than this one. This film totally seems like a rip-off of many other cool movies, filled with clichés about drug dealers, profanity, fast driving, catch phrases; but these LONG shots and the feel of the movie fails in every way to make them seem entertaining.I like Ryan Gosling, he's done well in other films (i.e. Remember the Titans, The Notebook, etc.). But okay, in this film, he's supposed to be the 'COOLEST guy in the WORLD!' No way hosay! And Bryan Cranston is in this film too, but he's so much better in Breaking Bad; as well as Albert Brooks Albert Brooks & Ron Perlman. In this film, there're all TOTALLY void of acting, depth, being likable, and interesting. It's almost as if M. Night Shamalan directed this movie. NO ONE lightens up in this movie! The entire feel of the film is void of any character development, interesting plots, likable characters, sense, or situations.Usually the film focuses on LONG takes, just forcing to BEG that something will happen - and when they do, they're not nearly as interesting as anything that happens in the Fast & Furious series.I'm not kidding: after watching this movie, I took a nap for about an HOUR! It was THAT boring. It was totally surprising too.BAD movie! NON-interesting, Ryan Gosling has BETTER films he should be known for, NOT THIS! 2/10",2,2,7,17 January 2014
Frozen," Happy Anniversary & Happy New Year!
","I certainly DON'T think this movie is overrated (or perhaps people know something I don't know), but whoever is making those accusations, WHAT exactly are they comparing it to?? For people saying this movie or the song 'Let It Go' is overrated, what exactly are they comparing it to?? Almost 99% of the mainstream movies and music out there are immoral unethical garbage in this culture just to make a fast buck without anything meaningful in the plots or lyrics.This film is especially SO FAMOUS in Japan where I was born and raised and in fact still live, and I'm really looking forward to how children of this generation are going to turn into GREAT people in the near future, because of the impact of this magical flick. (Though I'm a little confused as to why 'Wreck-It Ralph' isn't as popular since SO many people from Japan love to play video games). ;) This film can teach children (especially girls) and also adults to let go of the past, to become self-reliant, and real love. This is something worthwhile children can learn from and help to create a potentially better future.BUT... if there is a downside to it, I maybe got a little confused to the hype of this film; I saw it, and wondered a bit if I saw the same movie everyone else did, 'cause the story looked really SIMPLE; someone leaves, others go off to get them, and they all come back. The end. It MAY seem that way, but they do make up for it with all the great songs, the amazing soundtrack, colorful & memorable characters, funny humorous and feel-good moments, breathtaking landscapes, lovely & realistic animation, the unexpected plot twists, and the overall valuable important messages it teaches.Look at what young people have to grow up with these days: constant violence and sexual immorality on TV and music and Internet, government corruption, global environment disasters and wars, etc. At least children have something good to learn how to act in such a stressful future they will one day have to take control of.As for the haters commenting (usually on YouTube but probably here in comments later on as more ppl read this), they are unthinkable bi-products of our mostly violent media culture.Believe it or not, I'm a GUY who likes this film, even if the two main characters are female. I LOVE the music too - I could listen to it over & over. (But hey, if 'Frozen' is a film that girls can relate to, then 'Big Hero 6' is a film definitely boys can relate to.)And what else? Positive emotions are contagious. In other words, when people are happy it spreads to other people much faster and farther than negative emotions which have a weaker effect on others; LOVE really is the biggest power there is (besides the love of God.) So as advice to children, take the advice of this famous movie and its famous song! Let go of the past, avoid evil people who only want to drag others down, focus on being with friendly people and live your life to the fullest. You deserve it. If you have a bad day, increase your positive energy even more.AND also... an immoral unhappy society usually degenerates into a paranoid police state. A society that promotes real love, forgiveness, respect, and friendliness have better chances of keeping a freer society. And the positive values mentioned above are what everyone is being taught through the message of the entire movie, especially at the end.Plus, the singer, Idina Menzel, who voiced Elsa & sung 'Let It Go', and the the guy who voiced Olaf are Jewish! I've a got a real soft spot for Jewish people, and I think it's all the more reason to like this film. And I'm glad Disney won the Oscar it SHOULD have for 'Wreck-It Ralph', rather than the disappointing 'Brave' bomb.I do also think this flick is rather 'Christ-like' in it's message; whether it be 'Some people are worth melting for', or Anna 'sacrifices' herself to save her sister.PS: Oh, and if you're wondering why I say 'children', and not 'kids', kids are offspring of goats - and Satanism has the head of a goat.

","Groundhog Day >>>>>>>>>> Ghostbusters (1 & 2)Seriously, that's a MUCH better Bill Murray movie you should check out - whole lot better story, plot, comedy, characters, idea, directing, and film-making! Something that Harold Ramis (Egon) directed!But this.... This?? Did I watch the exact same movie that so many drooling 80s kid are raving about??? Not only is it nonsensical, stupid, inappropriate, with bad dated effects, and having many characters with hardly anything likable about them, in my view, 'Ghostbusters' was way overrated, and is insanely rated 'PG' though it has a TON of swearing, sexual thematic elements & suggestive contents, and scary & frightening images! I BEG the MPAA to re-rate this flick for that very reason!The upsides I can list are the one joke about 'Dickless' did get a chuckle out of me. And the theme song seems a bit cool. But that's about it! I hardly laughed or smiled at all while viewing this - a film that both seems overrated & over-hyped. I DON'T GET IT! Every characters either dumb, annoying, or socially awkward. The character of Rick Moranis was almost totally ruined in being turned into a totally stupid character - his 'Honey, I Shrunk the Whatever' series was so much better. And the giant marshmallow man??? What was with that turning into a mascot sold in stores?? If I remember the story correctly, it was an accident!I'm so glad I didn't grow up with this film (while being a 90s kid), 'cause quite frankly, the caring people who loved & brought me up didn't WANT me to grow up with this schlock of a film! But Groundhog Day, THAT'S a film I DO wish I grew up watching that film!4/10",4,9,25,21 October 2014
Dumb and Dumber," 'Rocketman' >>>>> 'Dumb and Dumber'
","First off, I'm a HUGE fan of comedies - just see my IMDb list called 'Funniest & Most Hilarious Movies ever'; films like 'Rocketman' (starring Harland Williams) & 'Groundhog Day' (starring Bill Murray) which are genuinely funny, family-friendly, and have got appropriate humor in them. And kind of a guilty pleasure but I do like 'Gigli' for a few reasons, too (Never understood all the bashing & hate).But THIS??? Judging by the poster, it seemed like a flick that was gonna be horrendously dumb, awful, and stupid. I WASN'T WRONG!Did those who've written glowing reviews of Dumb & Dumber see the same movie I did?? Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels have done some great movies, but this is not one of them! Look, I wanted to like this flick, I really did. But it's an astounding PUTRID dumb film, and a complete waste of celluloid, IMO.Though to be fair, the scene where Harry slams the bathroom door in the face of the guy who's gonna... *ahem*... RAPE Lloyd, in order to put out the fire on his foot, was kinda funny. Even with some of the worst movies you could giggle a bit.Understand. 'Nostalgic' doesn't mean 'better' - it just means you're more attached to it. It boggles my mind that Carrey is one of the highest paid actors out there. This movie, and the one he appeared in before it ('Ace Ventura'), are unbelievably awful & overrated. These films utilize slapstick/absurdest humor, as opposed to Carrey's running gag of distorted faces and talking out of his butt. Plus, him having a chipped tooth is NOT FUNNY! Oftentimes I felt like saying, 'What the &%$#@? are you doing???' The characters of Lloyd and Harry are an INSULT to your intelligence! Even if you liked their brand of humor, wouldn't it get old after 30 minutes or so??? My advice: I recommend you go watch Jim Carrey's 'The Grinch' or Jeff Daniel's '101 Dalmatians' - they play much more convincing & less annoying characters than in this.But this overrated film was so cringe-worthy that the only reason I sat through it was to see how ridiculous it would get. The story as a whole was difficult to follow, due to the two acting like a distracting fools most of the film. This movie is about a briefcase that never gets mentioned again, bad language, abuse for women, violent homosexuality, gross-out humor, annoying humor, bad pop-culture references, jealousy, unfunny/nonsensical humor, inappropriate humor, and generally other things that I particularly don't want to watch. It's basically a film that tries WAY TOO HARD! And the ending was just awful, left a bad taste in my mouth, being the last nail in the coffin of this bad movie. Long story short, 'The Mask' was the only 'good' Jim Carrey film that came out in 1994.I'm all-round so glad I didn't grow up with this flick; because if I had, I would've likely lost HALF OF MY BRAIN if I did! I would just like it to have my memory erased for acknowledging it exists!Overall, this one is a real dud in my opinion, I give it 3/10PS: Happy 20th anniversary... NOT!",2,2,8,13 October 2014
Brave," I'm gonna hate this movie forever!
","Wreck-It Ralph smashes 'Brave' to pieces! Wreck-It Ralph should've won the Best Animated Picture Oscar!Seriously, THAT animated film had MUCH better, original, engaging, and entertaining story than this overrated flop. Disappointing and abomination from FRIGGIN' PIXAR! Though I get them credit for giving this princess a pretty cool new look, the story & the characters felt so clichÃ©d and non-entertaining. Other princess story archs (which we already know and seen were pulled into this story. 'The princess who doesn't want to be a princess' (Jasmine) 'Full of adventure and explorer of new things (Belle) 'She has to marry someone she doesn't want to' (Pocahontas) 'and the mother turns into a bear' (Brother Bear - that one wasn't a success) And all the fighting and arguments she has with her mother are quite jarring and uninteresting to watch.It's just messing around with Disney princess story lines we've ALL seen before!Gosh, the trailers were so misleading and the whole film in particular was a HUGE letdown. It was stupid, in-cohesive, annoying, cringe-worthy, and certainly NOT a family-friendly film (in my opinion.)Mostly it just sticks with silly humor aimed at kids, and I really don't think adults would enjoy this film as much.PS: And this is the first PIXAR film that shows bare butts and a friggin' BOOB dive. DISGUSTING!Really, Pixar....",3,1,8,22 July 2015
Prisoners," Dear Academy Awards, the 'cinematography' is not what drew me into this film!
","It was the powerful performances coming from Hugh Jackman & Jake Gyllenhaal!!! REALLY, you guys...(NOTE: I watched this film, simply because I was curious, like any other movie buff. I usually don't like movies with violence or swearing. And I don't like when any favorite celebrity of mine curses or swears, but perhaps that's just me.)The fact is, it's hard to make a good film. But this... This is officially the best non-X-men-related Hugh Jackman film I've seen! I admit, the man is talented & gifted. (I'm not a fan of the X-Men franchise, for certain reasons. I.E. unscientific Darwinian evolution) (No, I didn't really like 'Les Miserables' - I still think Liam Neeson was the better 'Jean Valjean'; this film's also better than 'The Prestige').Back to the subject matter, this is a film that definitely WAS suspenseful! From BEGINNING to END, I was hooked! Thrilling & mysterious at the same time! The acting, GREAT - Hugh Jackman, WOW. And the tension...oh my word!! I especially love the story line of black and white families fellow shipping together - I've had quite a bit of that experience myself. I think it's great, cute, charming, worthwhile, & helps anyone develop as a person . Seriously, this film had me GUESSING and GUESSING. The entire time! Wondering who was where, who did what, what happened, etc,.I LOVE films that do that! It's a bummer you can't erase your memory of all the revealed plot twists & the ending; that's when you get the desire to watch the film again with a person who hasn't seen it before. REALLY well-directed film, I'm betting it's going to stay in my mind for a long time!Conclusively, Paul Dano is one actor I really don't like; but it was a smart move to include him in this flick; they turned him into a socially awkward & weird character, to get beat up and all - that kind of relieved my negative feelings toward him. (I mean, he was *annoying* in 'The Girl Next Door', 'There Will Be Blood' and '12 Years a Slave' - some films of which I don't really like.)Jake Gyllenhaal's cop character is pretty cool in this film; he and Jackman share great on-screen chemistry together! MUCH BETTER than that horrible 'End of Watch' film, a worthless pile of nothing, with rancorous dialogue, & all-round cantankerous characters you didn't even care about! Moving way back, I'm a fan of Gyllenhaal, simply because I've got a soft spot for talented Jewish people; a fan of his since watching 'October Sky', which is a true story.Hugh Jackman's character, even as a father, is so believable (he really rocks the beard! lulz). You could see the intense emotion he develops throughout the film trying to find his daughter & her friend, and the lengths he goes to try to find them! He almost somewhat reminded me of my own Dad! WHY he didn't get nominated for Best Leading Actor, I honestly don't know! Would've been much better than this being Academy-nominated for 'Best Achievement in Cinematography' (which went to 'Gravity' for whatever strange reason, when the earth was the background the entire time), or rather than the nomination for Best Actor going to Bruce Dern (an actor I don't really like or care about, nor did I find his performance in 'Nebraska' the very LEAST interesting, compelling, or memorable!); also, doesn't every film try to have the 'best cinematography' there is??? Why Academy??? WHY??? What did this film ever do to you!?? Why did you instead even nominate the cast of that horrible & annoying 'American Hustle' flick!??Hugh Jackam's Oscar nomination should've been for THIS amazing film, instead of 'Les Mis'.But to be fair, the downsides to the film are of course the violence, pervasive cursing, drunkenness, and even the shameful religion of Catholicism being depicted as well, with false idols of the Virgin Mary & talking of priests as 'father' & all. (Trust me when I say Catholicism is a real dark false religion, but that's another long story. Just Google Search 'Man In Black tract' if you want the short story.)But moving back, technically-speaking... while this movie was suspenseful, at the same time I kept having to move to a different computer & keep installing the players; I was always anxious, CURIOUS to know what would happened next! That just kept building the thrills & suspense even *MORE*.A lot of people have mixed feelings about the ending to this film; to me, I was not disappointed! The style of the ending was indeed amazing, and I think more films should do it! I always now imagine how the story must have continued after the ending... And I love that - I love movies with endings that leave you guessing!And WHY on earth do those 'negative reviews' about this film exist & where dare they coming from!?? They say this film is 'overrated'!?...Didn't they watch the exact same film I did!??Seriously, Wow... just wow. The title 'Prisoners' was a really creative choice - it made sense & everything paid off in the story!And I love that quote: 'Pray for the Best, Prepare for the Worst.' ...Ditto to that!Just wrote this review because I had some free time, and because this film deserved it!Definitely one of the best films, I admit, of 2013, right alongside with Man of Steel....8/10",8,0,6,29 October 2014
Toy Story 2," The best one of the series!
","...and I dare say most underrated as well! Well, this a review I'm FINALLY gonna be typing out for a film that really deserves it.And I think it deserves a rating HIGHER than '7.9' - like seriously?? I read that earlier it had a '8.1'!Now I watched the first Toy Story a ZILLION times before this sequel was released - and rightfully so. I mean I was no more than 5, and the playroom with the television set & VHS player was just my jam! (NOt to mention those fun CD games I used play on Windows computers) But, I'm even quite a big movie buff today; but most of the time, I now usually make YouTube videos discussing the issues of Science, Creation, Evolution, and Dinosaurs.Anyways, this film was the very first movie I saw in the THEATER! I was just 7 years old! And at that point in my life, not only did life feel so innocent & easy, but I liked movies not so much for their story, but more for their visuals - and Toy Story 2 had that in DROGUES! (As well as 'Phantom Menace', though that's a flick generally everyone almost hates.)Furthermore, most often times, I seem to meet people (especially in Japan here) who either know more about the first Toy Story, or the most recent 3rd one. I feel as if a lot people aren't referencing this movie ENOUGH! And though it is somewhat generally well-known, I still feel as if doesn't get enough attention it deserves! I mean, you've got a much better story (compared to the 1st or 3rd one, IMO), lots of new characters (Zurg being my favorite), an AMAZING intro with Buzz (which quite literally BLEW me away when I was just 7 years old in that theater), there being comic references to Japan (the country where I was born & now live in - which kinda asks the question, why isn't this film more famous here if Japan got referenced a lot, like in 'Cars 2'?), amazing plot twists, a climax that takes place in an airport (Oh, and I just *love* airports & airplanes - they're my favorite form of travel, though I haven't used them very often), jokes that work with both children and adults, great pop-cultural references (like 'Star Wars - Empire Strikes Back colorful characters, stunning animation, great character study, pretty memorable songs, soundtrack, scenes, and quotes, HILARIOUS blooper end credits that just keep making me laugh over & over etc.And a good thing the movie was nominated for an Oscar (AT ALL!) for the song 'When Somebody Loved Me' - and rightfully so. That's a song that my sisters kept singing out of the blew almost every year I was growing up - just to mention for laughs.But I believe it's THIS movie that should've won PIXAR an Oscar for Best Animated Film much earlier - not Toy Story 3, really; I think that's one that should've gone to 'How To Train Your Dragon'. I'm serious. And I almost felt something was LACKING from the 3rd Toy Story; I don't know if it was the look of the animation, or whether the 'traveling' feel was absent, or if the jokes were too lame, or that I didn't cry at the end, or if the possible fact the movie seemed purely fueled by nostalgia purposes - I'm just still confused as to why it's made it on the Top 250 on IMDb. Shouldn't it be THIS movie instead!? Or who knows! Maybe the 3rd one DOES deserve to be up there, and I just don't know something that others do.And it's definitely one of the movies that Tom Hanks should be known for on his IMDb profile, rather instead of say 'The DaVinci Code' or 'The Green Mile' (those are just two films I can't stand, 'cause I either find them too overrated, too controversial, or just too weird) - Hanks' voice is just so well-acted in this movie (or fair enough, in the other two Toy Story's), I just imagine all the gestures & hand motions he must've done behind that microphone. lol Hey, he's an actor - he be as colorful, or over-the-top as he wants.Toy Story 2... It's just too good! In my opinion, it's WAY better than either 1 or 3. Not only do I think this is this one of the greatest sequels ever, it's also my favorite PIXAR movie, one of my favorite Disney movies, definitely one my favorite movies ever, and surely one of greatest movies of all time!!(FUNNY TRIVIA: It was this movie from where I learned the basic directions of LEFT & RIGHT - and my memory keeps coming back to it! hahaha)Someone PLEASE get this back onto the Top 250 on IMDb! I BEG you!10/10PS: But now, I wonder what they're gonna do with Toy Story 4?? I hope it'll be a great story, and a smart one, if they're really serious about returning to this franchise again... peace out, IMDb users! ;)",10,1,6,4 December 2014
Groundhog Day," Best movie ever. Am I right? Or am I right? ï»¿;-)
","EVER SINCE I first saw this film, that quote has never left my mind!HOW DID I never hear of this movie....?I'm a regular foreign guy in my 20's from Japan, born and raised; I'm not American, but have a background of British English, French, Swiss-German, and Japanese. And I'm *especially* interested in joining the acting/modeling business. HOW DID I MISS OUT ON THIS FILM MY WHOLE LIFE??? Groundhog Day should take 'Inception''s place, much higher on the IMDb's Top 250!People are saying 'the Godfather' or 'Shawshank Redemption' are the 'best movies ever'??? They're wrong. It's Groundhog Day! Unlike those overrated films which seem to encourage HORRIFIC behavior, this film encourages GOOD behavior - that's a big factor as to why I like it. It's especially a much better flick than 'Inception' because that's a film I pretty much didn't like because of it's confusing story and *unlikable* characters.And this movie had a way more entertaining, original, interesting, & much better romantic love story than overrated 'Titanic' per say, or even MOST Hollywood films that get produced! Certainly one of the most underrated films I've seen too. But it's RIGHT UP THERE with the awesome-ness of both 'STAR WARS' and 'LORD OF THE RINGS' - not joking!It looks as if Hollywood has such a narrow-minded fetish for hardcore violence, swearing, sexual immorality, etc. (you name it); but don't get me wrong, there's some in this film too, but it's used to a limited medium where it's generally quite subtle, and film is still an engaging, relatable, and even family-friendly!I can't BELIEVE this film wasn't a part of my childhood! I wish at some time at least a friend or *somebody* had told me about or recommended this to me sooner! I will admit, I currently envy those who grew up watching this film at an earlier age. I really wish that 'nostalgia factor' for this film was there for me too, like I had with the Disney films. YES! I'm going so far as to saying that. It would've been a lot more life-changing! Don't get me wrong. I watched this film (via iPod Touch) and was *amazed* by the simple story-telling, the amazing idea, and just the immense relatability. I noticed MUCH great spiritual elements in this flick too, like redemption and rebirth - seeing & understanding why many pastors, preachers, rabbis (even occult Buddhists) have expressed their admonition for this great piece of work. This is one GENIUS movie! No matter who you are, where you come from, what your thoughts are, or who you know, this is a film that will grab your attention, regardless!Everything about the direction, the acting, the story, the idea, the comedy, and character study was just mind-bogglingly amazing!! In the end, it's all kudos and congrats to the genius Jewish mind of Harold Ramis making a flick suitable for the whole general audience, IMO. I have a real soft spot for Jewish people, 'cause I think everything about their history, their people group, their identity, their heritage is all so magnificently special! They have been WAY TOO persecuted throughout history (ie. Hitler), and it's about time they had some friends! A lot of them have turned out to be incredibly smart & intelligent people throughout out history as well! And I'm a huge supporter of Israel.But back to the subject, I'm VERY astonished to this day as to why this movie totally missed by the Academy and never won ANY Oscars, or at the very least any nominations... So ridiculous. *I* would've given it apparently 5 Oscars! One for Best Director (Harold Ramis), Best Original Screenplay (Danny Rubin), Best Cinematography (John Bailey), Best Actor (Bill Murray), and Best Actress (Andie McDowell)!This may be the ONLY Bill Murray film I really, really like! Though I'm not a big fan of Bill Murray, nor any of the films he's previously done - whether it be Caddyshack, Ghostbusters, Lost In Translation, Scrooged - a bunch of which I never did laugh at nor did find the least bit entertaining, but just found stupid.But actress Andie McDowell is the one who really drew my attention to this film. Seeing the pretty dumb flick 'Four Weddings and a Funeral' (which was even nominated for 'Best Picture' - lol wut?) with Hugh Grant. But it was SHE who caught my attention, 'cause I remember seeing her cameo in 'Muppets From Space' (lol); and I saw on IMDb she was mostly recognized for this film 'Groundhog Day', and it's very high rating really caught my attention...so then I decided to check it out.This movie DESERVES to be in the very high-rated spot it currently is (though I think it should be *much higher* on the Top 250 on IMDb - I think it should switch places with 'Fight Club' or 'Inception' - which are ALSO some movies I don't really like).And I thought it was smart why this movie doesn't address WHY Phil keeps waking up to the same day - no explanation, no reason, no exposition - it just HAPPENS... and there's no problem going along with it! Though interestingly enough, Tom Cruise's recent 'Edge of Tomorrow' (which, by the way, I would say is a great tribute and dedication to the late Harold Ramis) did address how and why things where repeating over and over - and that worked well too!In the end, this film is definitely one of my favorite films of all time! Right along with 'Toy Story 2' (1999) , 'Tall Tale' (1995), & 'Shiokari Pass' (1977) RIP, Harold Ramis, you innovative Jewish genius! You will be missed! And this will live on forever! And it DEFINITELY deserves more attention in my home country of Japan!9/10",9,0,5,27 June 2014
Pulp Fiction," 'The Lion King' should've been nominated for Best Picture! Not this overrated pile of nonsensical, worthless schlock!!
","Happy 20th Anniversary ......NOT!!!Did I watch the exact same movie which SO many people have referred to and think it's some holy pop-cultural iconic movie??? I just don't get it, and I'll never get it!To be honest, I feel like calling this film 'Stupid People Going Around Doing Stupid Things' - I'm not joking! One thing after the other in this movie just CONFUSED me! The entire time I was like 'HUH!?' Everything about the story lines, occurrences, the dialogue, and the pay off was just stupid! And the f-bomb is dropped in every other sentence, so much so, I felt like punching the screen in! It's said so much to the extent where it gets really annoying! I like Samuel L. Jackson, especially for his Stars Wars and MARVEL superhero work, but I don't care if he's mostly known for this! I hate him playing such over-the-top, nonsensical, controversial characters!And I hate films that just take advantage of even white-washing the names of Christians, and have the bad guy quote Bible verses. That's dangerous! It's brainwashing & manipulation! (Want my advice of a real Christian is?? Rachel Scott of Columbine who was killed for her faith, Dietrich Bonhoeffer who spoke out against Hitler and Nazi Germany, or even Dr. Kent Hovind who reveals a lot of amazing scientific evidence for the fact of special Creation and Biblical accuracy.) All much better and meaningful then this overrated pile of worthless celluloid NOTHING!Though to be fair, I think Quentin does have an decent taste in soundtrack variety. I admit, I've got those songs on my iPod as a result of watching this flick. And I do think the scene of Christopher Walken's 'Watch' talk does for some reason relax me, simply because it's simply WALKEN - his delivery & his way of talking is somewhat kind of relaxing and amusing all at once. He's been interesting ever since I saw him in the comedy 'Mousehunt'. Though the scene STILL is stupid when the captain (or general, whatever) curses at a young boy about the 'A$$' and how even a young boy would want such a filthy watch after being inside many men's anuses for a long time.I mean, Tarantino's just some director I don't like or care about - he claims he's against drugs and violence... THEN DON'T MAKE FILMS ABOUT THEM! You may be just condoning or giving ideas about drugs and violence! You're definitely part of the 'Hollyweird' group aren't you??I'm all-round just THANK everything that is holy, sacred, and beneficial that I didn't see this film when I was younger! 1994 definitely was the big year for many good movies, but Pulp Fiction is certainly NOT one of them! It shouldn't have even been nominated for ANYTHING, not even Best Picture! IMO, 'The Lion King' should've been nominated in it's place instead! A film that's all the more likable, fun, entertaining, relatable, family-friendly, and beautifully put together, it's ART! But guess not, since Hollyweird has got such a FETISH for pure violence, murder, sexual immorality, and biased anti-Christian propaganda.Pulp Fiction is just PAINFUL to sit through; Tarantino's a HACK! And I've never liked or will ever like any of his films!",2,6,15,1 November 2014
Les Misérables," 1998 version >>>>>>>>>>>> 2012 version
","I don't CARE which 'represents the book' better; what matters is the movies! I have't read the book, and I'm not about to start. But as far as STORY goes, Liam Neeson's version takes the cake! I will say that if you like musicals, you may get a kick out of this flick. But I think this film is overrated, and it did NOT make me 'cry'.I really deeply feel the 1998 with both Geoffery Rush and Liam Neeson was atrociously missed by the Academy Awards!What I felt what the remake's biggest weakness was it was RUSHING over a lot of important plot points of the story, and there was hardly any emotional connection - and just sugar-coated it with all the singing. I really found it odd that both Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen were brought into this; I almost felt Johnny Depp was soon gonna show up! As far as I know, both these two nearly RUINED the movie for me, if was supposed to be FEELING anything serious.And Anne Hathaway... oh my word, I couldn't LOOK at her, for almost looking like a female Gollum; again, HOW does she become the 'most desirable woman' after having her teeth pulled & her hair cut??? Neither did I like it when she was singing - I thought she was gonna open her mouth and EAT me. She was *barely* in the movie, but Oscar in hand, bizarrely. (And I'm certain she's rather overrated as an actress, though I kind alike her during her 'Princess Diaries' years.)To be fair, this film does have a good score - and have a couple of them on my iPod, but also as well as the soundtrack for the 1998 version.A lot of the actors, I rather don't really like or care about; and plus, I just can't see Russell Crowe as a bad guy (Javert) - Geoffrey Rush was a WHOLE LOT more convincing as a menacing villain. Eddie Redmayne played a rather dimwitted and less attractive Marius in this version, than the guy back in the 1998 version; he just randomly sees Cosette and and just falls in love; how CLUNKY! And Amanda Seyfried is just another actress I don;t like for her reputation. Just about the whole CAST is unlikable!Oh and the 'boy who gets shot' in the story, it really shocked me in the original when the boy got shot by the troops; I gasped, totally saddened. But the boy in this adaptation... oh my HECK was he annoying - all his singing & mannerisms were just undeniable irritating! Instead I was like 'Thank You!' when he was shot.And and WHY is the camera man horrible at his work!? Too much close-ups of people's faces, wobbly frame, out of focus shots, etc. Somebody should fire him!Though many years later, I do thank a Les Miserables remake is necessary, but I think they did a mediocre & clunky job, IMO.Again, 1998 version was so much better than the 2012 version. The 2012 version was so pushed and in your face like damn it cry already. If you have good acting and good direction you don't need that extra push because it can happen naturally. And more than 50% of the singing in the 2012 version sucked. They chose certain Broadway actors but some weren't and their singing hurt my ears. And if you are going to do a musical don't talk during some of the most beautiful singing parts that was just dumb on their part. The acting was so much more powerful in the 1998 version and they didn't have to sing what was on their mind for you to understand what they were going through. I love the Broadway/concert version too but out of the film adaptations 1998 version is far better than the 2012. But I talk in full detail about the films compared in this video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NiJT9mQzokThe 1998 version is the best! Watch it and enjoy it!﻿5/10PS: And the ending made absolutely NO friggin' sense whatsoever!

The Departed," Most Horrible & Overrated Film of 2006! Mel Gibson's 'Apocalypto' was WAY BETTER!
","I want 151 minutes of my life back! Laugh-Out-Loud, Unmitigated Crap. Interesting...but not in the way intended. Somehow watchable, but NOT Good! So ridiculously bad, it's hilarious, but still a waste of time. The moral decline of the western culture. Way too trite and poorly acted. If only I could go back in time to stop this movie from being made! Propaganda in service of oppression and hypocrisy. A little self-awareness might have made this a much better film. What a ridiculous load of crap! Cringingly bad! UGH! No really, this was the stupidest movie I ever watched. I do not recommend it one bit! And the f-word being uttered like EVERY other sentence, almost to the point where it gets kind of annoying! An excuse to put DiCaprio in it & try to convince us he can act. Don't watch it unless you truly want some hardcore violence & just want to hear DiCaprio scream & yell like a insecure deranged maniac (like just about every other film he's been in).Get this 'Awful Movie with Awful Characters doing Awful Things' movie out of my head! Oh, if they only played it for realism.Exhibiting the WORST of Hollywood ! I mean, so we ALWAYS have to have films showing the dark side of the human person?? Why not more feel-good movies that would be encouraging or inspiring! If we're always making soings about loving each other, then why do we tolerate garbage like this?? All it will be is just a BAD, I repeat, BAD influence!Screw this movie... except for DiCaprio getting shot in the head - that part was gold.1/10 PS: Want a better film from the year 2006??? Then by all means, watch 'Apocalypto'! In my opinion, it's much better & suspenseful than 'Passion of the Christ', or even MORE Oscar-worthy than this 'Departed' trash.",1,3,10,21 March 2015
Edge of Tomorrow," I think EVERY famous actor & actress should have their own 'Groundhog Day' film! :D
","The truth is, whether or not you like Tom Cruise as an actor, you WILL like this movie!Yeah, even I referenced that great movie, even though everyone else has already, but it still is worth it! Because I remember the first time watching that Bill Murray and being absolutely BLOWN AWAY! This, this is the 'futuristic action sci-fi alien invasion' version of Groundhog Day, if you will! Tom Cruise once again proves he's still got some talent! This flick was also directed by a Jewish guy, much like Harold Ramis - all the more reason to like it again!This movie gave me one of the most exciting theater experiences I ever had! ;D Also I was interested to learn it was based off a Japanese comic originally titled 'All You Need Is Kill', since I actually LIVE in Japan! But don't worry, the Japanese advertisement titled this film appropriately as it's original title, in Japanese Katakana - 'オール・ユー・ニード・イズ・キル.' whatever.I also thought interesting the plot actually EXPLAINED why Tom Cruise (his character's name Cage), is repeating the same day over & over, whilst Groundhog Day never did explain, though it was still interesting; albeit the alien blood, the OMEGA artifact, etc. Which actually kinda reminded me of the 'Omega 13' from the sci-fi comedy 'Galaxy Quest.' But I digress, 'cause THAT's even a good reference!I believe actress Emily Blunt deserves to be known for basically THIS movie, on her IMDb profile! Not that overrated pile of trash 'Looper.' I thank GOD she was written as a cool character She became a great sidekick & genuine love interest to Cage; and I'm glad she didn't become a typical damsel in distress being over-sexualized with giant distracting jiggling boobs. lolI give credit to AMC theaters giving the recommendation to go seeing this movie - they're quite a legit movie talk show! Because all in all, this movie had HORRIBLE marketing campaigns; there're can be bad trailers to good movies, and good trailers to bad movies! Something to think about.If there is any slight down-side to this movie, I might say besides the casual intense violence or language in the film, I felt perhaps Bill Paxton was out of place as the war general. I think probably Bill MURRAY should've been cast instead; it would've been a GREAT homage to 'Groundhog Day', the film he's mostly known for, rather than just naming the lead female character 'Rita', like the one in Groundhog Day.But seriously, ANYONE who's a huge fan of sic-fi, action, alien invasions, repeating time, etc., THIS is the movie for you - you WON'T be disappointed!9/10",9,0,5,9 November 2014
Whiplash," So...the moral of the story is... be mean & harsh to people if you want them to do better!!?????
","I like J.K. Simmons, especially for during his Spider-man years - I think he's all the more deserving of that Oscar for being underrated for so long (still hope Edward Norton gets his pretty soon.)And I love jazz, and I love all sorts of genres of music; as long as I hear a good talented song, whatever it is, I i like it. Though I draw the line at heavy metal.I just watched this film just to see what all the hype was about - saw on people's review videos, from film critics, from Best Movies of 2014 lists, etc. But I'm a Christian, and I prefer more the wholesome, family-esc, morally strong, uplifting, and feel-good movies that are just enjoyable to the general audience. and I'm not a fan of violence or profanity, nore do I find them the least bit entertaining.Overall, I just think this film is quite unrealistic; a teacher bullying his students, especially in music classes, in New York. I just honestly don't think that would happen - I don't think I have any friends who practice any of the drums have a teacher even remotely close to that of Flecther.(Though it's almost ironic how Simmons - the actor I like - played the antagonist, while Miles Teller - an actor I almost don't like - played the protagonist.In the end, I give this film a a solid '6' simply for Simmons keeping me on the edge of my seat.PS: Want to watch a good, wholesome underrated film?

The Wolf of Wall Street," Horrendously Awful... and Sinful (no apologies)
","I just needed to watch this movie to get it over with, especially hearing that it's the movie with the most f-words ever. I thought, 'Wow, really? Let's see how bad this is.' Yeah, I'm a film snob, and I never take any attitude or bad words from any movies, and cast them upon others. Thank G-d. With that said, pretty much every single one of Martin Scorsese's movies are so hard to watch. They're dark & sinful! What? Does Martin sell his soul to the devil every time he makes these?If it's supposed to be 'REALITY', we get it, but leave the reality-telling to the professionals if you PLEASE!What is going through Martin Scorsese's HEAD? Frankly the only film from him I have liked from him is HUGO (2011). A film almost anyone can watch & be mesmerized. Check it out, you won't be disappointed. THIS film is putrid garbage, filled with vulgar language, sexual perverseness, and quite possibly the most unlikable characters ever put on-screen.Leonardo DiCaprio is quite possibly the worst actor since Jim Varney's coffin - all he can do is shout & swear. How's that 'acting'?? Is the F-word the only word in his dictionary?????? Cursing & swearing is a degenerate sarcasm for those who have lost their decent vocabulary. DiCaprio should have RETIRED perhaps after Titanic. There are some exceptions to the rule of course, but most child actors grow up to be talentless hacks; no doubt DiCaprio's one of them. Apparently, why didn't he die, instead of Paul Walker?It's really sad that the real Jordan Belfort is Jewish. Jewish people are the original chosen people blessed by G-d. Blessed through Abraham, they were given amazing wisdom & intelligence. And a lot more Jewish people got involved in this movie (ie. Jonah Hill, Rob Reiner, Jon Favernau, etc.) It's just SAD that a lot of people are born into this world with a G-d-given intelligence, but they use the totally wrong way for the totally wrong things. They just ruin themselves & other people!Throughout history, Jewish people have turned out to be incredibly smart & intelligent people. And Albert Einstein, Emma Lazarus, Ben Stein, Larry King, Wolf Blitzer, FRED, VenomFangX, Adam Brody, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Adam Levine, Adrian Brody, Billy Crystal, Jack Black, Seth Rogen, Jerry Seinfeld, Liev Schreiber, Paul Shaffer, Ron Perlman, The Coen brothers, Paul Rudd, Milton Berle, Mel Brooks are just SOME of them.Even MORE sad that most comedians get their inspiration from Lenny Bruce who was ALSO Jewish - it's just ALL wasted potential.Hate this movie, hate the characters, hate the language, hate the attitudes & behavior, NEVER in a million years will i watch this again. STOP MAKING THESE KINDS OF MOVIES, SCORSESE!And good thing it TANKED at the box office, no wonder. I still have faith in humanity. And what WAS with that dumb humming???Great 2014 is going to be a great year in film, 'cause a lot of good-willed movies based on plots & stories that make SENSE!1/10 WORST FILM OF 2013, and OF ALL TIMEPS: PLEASE check out the Ken Ham vs Bill Nye Debate on Feb. 4, debating the Creation/Evolution issue - it's worth the watch.",1,11,27,12 January 2014
The Green Mile," Amazing cast!.... but weird story
","Death-row prison guard Paul Edgecomb (Hanks) and his kind-hearted colleagues on E block's Green Mile (the path from the cells to the electric chair) have their routine disrupted by new inmates, a friendly mouse, a maliciously unprofessional coworker and a series of supernatural events.Set in Depression-era Louisiana, the Green Mile tells several human stories, all of them touched by E block's new tenant, John Coffey, a hulking black man accused of killing twin girls. The more his captors get to know this gentle giant, the more they're convinced of his innocence. John soon displays a miraculous gift of healing, creating internal conflict for the men who must oversee his execution.Based on a story by horror scribe Stephen King, this 3-hour film has a lot going for it. Motifs of good vs. evil dominate, contrasting warm, selfless characters with others who personify humanity's ugliness. It also credits God with endowing miracle workers.What's disappointing about The Green Mile is its abrasive flip side. The same people who acknowledge divine power are quick to use God's name profanely. Obscenities, as well as ribald sexual and anatomical references, tarnish the dialogue. Graphic depictions of urination, erotica and violence (brutal electrocutions the most unsettling) could have left more to the audience's imagination.Despite moments of uplift, The Green Mile suffers from harsh elements and a frustratingly bittersweet climax. Some great scenes, but the lasting impression is like heartburn after a fairly satisfying meal.5/10 Enjoyed the casting & the miracles, don't like the hypocrisy, blasphemy, cursing, or confusing characters.",5,1,6,9 April 2014
Inception," Liked the Music & Special Effects, but... Eh.
","I REALLY wanted to liked this movie.To make this short, the music & special effects were cool, but the characters and story were NOT cool. I dislike Marion Cottilard. I hate DiCaprio's shouting. I dislike Ellen Page. I can't believe the Angels in the Outfield boy was in this. The message doesn't make sense, and it's all a jumbled mess. Too much blasphemy, taking the Lord's name in vain, the characters are annoying & unlikable, they needed better writing. And who has ever had a dream, in a dream, in a dream, in a dream, in a dream...??? The idea is just silly!Christopher Nolan didn't need to give us this pile of pig-lard.You really wanna know what I think??

The Terminal," Happy 10-Year Anniversary!
","First off, I want to mention I love airports & airplanes! They're my favorite means of traveling. When I first saw this, I was 12 years old. I remember begging my Dad to watch the Incredibles again (even though it was gonna be in Japanese) but he insisted otherwise. So I went a long with it, seeing as how my Dad is a big Tom Hanks fan, just as I have become. ;) We watched this flick as a family and a whole bunch of friends - I remember it like it was yesterday. Boy, did everything work together & right in this flick. It had everything it needed to be a good film! First off, Tom Hank's foreign accent was very convincing - after all, he is a great actor! Stanley Tucci is great at playing the smart-alack-y & unlikable airport bully - liked him in 'Beethoven' too. Catherine Zeta-Jones is excellent, as always, as the love interest; though actually I think she's prettier in the 'Zorro' films.A lot of the supporting characters are quite colorful & memorable too. Need I mention the beautiful Zoe Saldana? When I was sitting there in the theater, I was just captivated by how pretty she looked; and 10 years hasn't changed that at all. ;)I enjoy the product placement as well; store after store. lol. John Williams' score is really memorable, beautiful, and uplifting too - I often listen to the main theme of the movie.I also give credit to this movie for introducing me to Benny Golson.So many scenes & lines in this movie still make me feel a range of emotions to this day.Some of the memorable lines include: 'Bite to eat.' 'I hate the Tuesday!' 'Do you have an appointment?' 'He chit.' 'So we 'Cher' the panties?' 'I wait!' 'You touch it again, I kill you.' 'Goat.' 'I am delayed... long time.' 'Get lost.' 'What time? Dinner time.'Amazingly, the entire 'terminal' set was built inside of an old aircraft hanger! Kudos to Steven Spielberg for always proving to be amazing & creative.I think my favorite scenes in this film are when Viktor finds out about the Quarters, when Viktor starts ordering from Burger King, when Gupta tells his story about India, the end credits with all the autographs of the people who made the movie (that was very unique), and when Gupta manages to stop the airplane with his mop! (Seriously, the music in that scene was really gripping my heart - I thought Gupta was gonna get killed by the plane.)The only downside I've got with this film is the language - often times language takes me out of a film (whether it is 4-letter words or blasphemy). Plus, Tom Hanks' past is a little depressing, regarding how he wrote a beautiful letter at 16 years-old of how much he loved the Lord, and wanted to serve Him with his life; then he went off to college, studied false philosophy (i.e. Darwinian evolution) & likely destroyed his faith; as of now, he stars in movies with little or no morals. I'm just saying I feel sorry for him in that area.But overall, people can enjoy this film! Great time, no alcohol required, and worth buying on Blu-Ray.8/10",8,0,4,13 July 2014
The Shawshank Redemption," Happy 20th Anniversary ......I think
","First off, films REALLY DO have the tendency to be overrated or underrated these days. And this film is no exception. Simple fact, I'm not a fan at all of Stephen King or his work, or the films that are BASED off his work. Just too dark, too controversial, too creepy, too horrendous, too controversial, and too uncomfortable to sit through.Is this really one of the 10 best films of all time? Shawshank is not a downright bad movie but it has some severe flaws and I have no clue how everyone chooses to overlook them. The problem I have with it is how it absolutely oversimplifies everything. Shawshank for the most part focuses on exploring the idea of 'Hope' (one of the most overused ideas in any prison movie), but in order to do so, it treats everything as black or white with no middle ground. I will say that 'The Shawshank Redemption' is not an 'awful' film. This isn't a poorly made film with more crude humor than storyline. One of the positives of the film lies in the IMAGERY. The shot of all the prisoners in the prison yard looking up to the heavens as music plays is an amazing shot, one of the most memorable shots I've ever seen.Shawshank was really hard to watch; with all the violence and swearing, I don't think it does the story justice. I understand this film was nominated for Best Picture, and I've heard people whine, left and right, that Forrest Gump did, and Shawshank didn't. Well, the way I see it, I really don't mind. I don't like how this film seems to use the name of God, or Jesus, as a bad thing, used by the world's biggest hypocrites in Shawshank (ie. the Warden); it's one of the reasons why I like Forrest Gump better so much; there isn't much violence, hardly any swearing, and even treats & talks the name of the Lord in a good way.The villain of the film, Warden Norton, is an incredibly cartoonish, two dimensional bad guy. He and Cal from Titanic could have a 'pure-evil-for-the-sake-of-being-pure-evil' standoff. Aside from greed, we have no idea what made him who he was.I see that actors William Sadler and Jeffrey DeMunn are well known for being in this flick, though a much better film that they both star in is 'Rocketman' (1997), a wild, slap-happy family-friendly comedy. Please do check it out sometime!! And I don't even like hearing Morgan Freeman curse at all. 'Driving Miss Daisy' is a much better performance of his, and is a great way for people to be introduced to him, growing up (or maybe even 'Evan Almighty' is a good one, too). Tim Robbins, I guess was okay. Though he was also bizarrely in 'Howard the Duck'; it doesn't have anything to do with it, I know - it's queer to see how far he's come. And it sure is strange the head guard, who is often so prone to violence & swearing is the one who voiced Mr. Krabs in Spongebob Squarepants. Ar-Ar-Ar-Ar! Though to be fair, the escape scene is really where things get interesting, how everything comes together, and the ending definitely is pretty sweet - kinda makes you wish you could see the ending go on from there.But in the end, I'm quite glad I didn't grow up with this film - because, sadly like many others, it might have brainwashed, badly-influenced, or manipulated me to what 'reality is supposed to be like' in such a subversive & biased way.I never had any friends that ever 'owned' or ever 'recommended' this film, because likely they feel the same way. One other thing that subtly bothered me was, if this story takes place over 20 years in prison... why doesn't anybody seem to AGE??? What happened to the Makeup Department??Though I don't entirely hate this film - it's got likable actors, good acting, cool character development (i guess), great camera work, decent music, some good effort, and a feel-good ended scene - but it's really overwhelmed by so much bad, it almost makes the good stuff non-existent or even seem 'sugar-coated'.IMO, Groundhog Day is a much better film worth to be nominated for Oscar and even considered one of the 'greatest films ever', not this nor 'the Godfather'.5/10 PS: Want a better film from 1994??? Go watch either 'Iron Will', 'Angels In The Outfield,' 'The Jungle Book,' 'The Swan Princess', 'A Troll In Central Park', 'Speed', 'The Little Rascals', 'True Lies', 'The Santa Clause', or even 'Forrest Gump.' PS 2: 'Pulp Fiction' should not even have been NOMINATED that same year for a 'Best Picture' Oscar, being an overrated worthless pile of nothing - it should've been the Lion King nominated! Pulp Fiction can go off and die.",5,0,4,2 November 2014
Lucy," WOW was this bad!
","Beforehand, just gotta mention that Dr. Kent Hovind's seminars offer a whole lot better scientific credibility than Morgan Freeman does in this flick.I like Scarlet Johanssen - her movies are usually impressive & she plays strong female characters.BUT HOLY HECK was this bad! The trailers made it look really cool! But it lost me when it stepped into religious science fiction is trying to shove the Darwinist world view down our throats.Overall, this movie was uncomfortable, weird, and an utter disappointment.I liked the special effects & the music, but the characters & story, not very much.Great idea, poorly executed4/10",2,0,10,4 September 2014
Easy A," THIS film ended Amanda Bynes career! What is UP with Hollywood!???
","UGH! My blood was boiling... from beginning to end. Now, I like Emma Stone - she's smart, she's cool, she's likable, she's funny, and I think she's even got the strength to carry a film ALL by herself! And I think 'The Help' and 'The Amazing Spider-Man' films are the best ones she's in. And I'd be lying if I said I didn't like 'Superbad' for igniting her film career. ...But I HATE it when she gets stuck in a stupid, worthless steaming pile of Hollywood trash! Such as this - having to say all these things, having to DO all these things.WHERE do I begin???????????This is not worse of than most films, but this goes from stupid to DISGUSTINGLY INSULTING!To recap a bit, this movie was on my 'to watch' list for quite a while; I thought at first it seemed like an interesting film about 'better student training' or about a 'big test' or 'spelling bee contest' coming up (hence the grade 'A' reference.)But NO! NOT AT ALL, ironically.Talk about disappointing. Literally, 5 minutes in, I already started to hate it! I did not laugh ONCE! I was shaking my head & rolling my eyes with disgust. I couldn't WAIT for this movie to end - I couldn't even THINK straight while it was playing. Because it takes these rather classic Hollywood attempts of FAILED advantages of pure bias, lame-stream political-correctness, and liberal agendas on our brains. The Christian Bible-thumping hypocrites who are 'abnormal' and everyone else is 'normal', and the misunderstood gays, who're your enemies, who're your friends, eavesdropping, rumor-spreading, deceiving others, blasphemy, underage drinking, cursing, sex, swearing, alcoholism, etc... Trust me, EVERY one of those are misunderstood in real-life.I guess the 'Christians' we're decided to be the antagonists, because I guess the writers couldn't come up with a better villain; besides that, they are not even written well. All one- dimensional, stereotypical, and dumbfounding, it's all cringe-worthy, rather than funny. I guess it's just the thing nowadays who you can make fun of: Christians and southernersPerhaps what saddens me most about this film is that when Olive goes looking for honest, Christian answers about sex, she can't find any. And so she settles for our culture's dangerously self-righteous take on this immensely important subject: It's my business and nobody else's.If this movie was supposed to 'appeal' to the types of people who think these inaccurate things, I suggest they go see some psychiatrist, or I even recommend one of my teachers, Kent Hovind, as a great guy to check out on his Science seminars! (Seriously go search him up - he's worth it.)And WHO, in their right mind, would ever want to 'lie' about sleeping around with people?????Hey, I myself am a Christian, and I wish to eventually get a career of acting in Hollywood because I do believe some great example & lights are necessary to be shown in that corrupted system of darkness. I love gay people, but I believe homosexuality is a sin - because it's a violation of design. People are never 'born' gay - it's all based on experience. (but that's another long story). Just love the sinner, hate the sin.And I hate how they turned Amanda Bynes, a funny, talented, lovely Jewish actress, one of my favorite actresses (from 'Big Fat Liar & 'Robots') into a 'stupid, air-headed, mean, annoying, judging, finger-pointing Christian', putting blasphemous, un-Christ-like, unbiblical things in her mouth & personality, which I think seems quite hypocritical of this film being a 'hate speech' film, and as well being a mean, annoying, judging, and finger-pointing FILM! I find it really pitiful that Amanda Bynes is 'most known' for this film on IMDb - trust me, she's been in better movies.)And I bet it's THIS film that sort of ENDED her film career, giving her a 'bad reputation', and hardly appears in any more films and for getting in trouble with the police & having her mugshots taken. Fantastic! Well-done, Will Gluck, for ruining a young actress' career.(Hey, you want a film that portrays real TRUE Christians, being one myself, my strong recommendation is watch 'The Encounter', 'To Save a Life', or 'Facing the Giants'.) Those are some films that are SO MUCH much more accurate, meaningful, and truthful in their messages. lot In actuality, in an ideal good-will movie,, we'd be the good guy protagonist, or the stalwart sidekick of the main character. I'm honest. Trust me, in real-life, it's the CHRISTIANS who feel they're getting picked on, or mocked, or being mistreated. Go figure! (The creators of 'God's Not Dead' understood that! And THAT's even a film that's misunderstood.)And bringing Malcolm McDowell into the movie???? WHOA. That's quite risky business of wanting to likely draw attention to his most well-known film 'A Clockwork Orange', literally one of the most awful, confusing, and corrupt flicks out there.Even bringing in Stanley Tucci and Thomas Haden Church into this circus show! Stanley Tucci was better in 'The Terminal' and even the 4th 'Transformers' film! (Yes, I went there) And Church was even better in 'Heaven Is For Real' - that's also another film based on reality that I recommend).Literally one of the worst films I think ever made, and I'm GLAD I never watched it earlier, or ever saw it in a theater!But to be fair, Church, Stone, and Tucci are the best parts in this mess.As Amanda Bynes puts it, 'This is so stupid.'My final grade I put on this film is a 'D -', just 1 steps way from an 'F'.3/10PS: imo, Emma Stone looks better with blond hair. That's not a joke.",2,5,12,20 January 2015
Shark Tale," Happy 10th Anniversary!
","(NOTE: I'm a white guy from Japan, born and raised. And I loved this movie! Don't try a stereotype it saying only those in the 'black crowd' like it, especially because it has Will Smith. lol wut???)Oh, and the the Nostalgia Critic is wrong, for being way too biased about this. I LIKE this film! Because it RULES! It's funny, it's creative, and it's cool & has effort! It ain't no 'masterpiece', but it's not 'bad' either! What do you expect from DreamWorks??? Don't put too much pressure on them! And Oscar the fish?? I never found him ugly! He does have a big mouth though. lulzBeing 12 when I first saw this, MAN, did I get a kick out of it! Though understand, 'nostalgic' doesn't mean 'better' - it just means you're more attached to it. But on it's own, I believe it still holds up to this day! And I think it DOESN'T deserve to get a majority of the hate it's been getting for who knows who. It really seems like films have the tendency to be overrated or either underrated, unfairly hated or unfairly loved these days - c'mon, all the hate on this film should be re-directed at something else; like 'Never Cry Wolf', a horrid film that should NOT be called a 'Disney' film.Moving way back, I give CREDIT to this animated film for INTRODUCING me to many big Hollywood names! Yeah, most of them I didn't really know at the time! I guess it's the cool thing about kid's films - famous names should at SOMETIME make their introduction to the minors in the audience! You name it! Whether it'd be Will Smith, Robert De Niro, Jack Black, Angelina Jolie, Renée Zellweger, or Martin Scorsese (despite his putrid films that seem to glorify horrific behavior). And to this day,the fish LOOKING like the celebrities they're being voiced by! And all the jokes in the film worked too, especially the in-jokes.Honestly, I've NEVER found this movie to be a 'rip-off' of 'Finding Nemo' - I like any film about the ocean, as long as they're done RIGHT & tell a good story. And I think that's what this movie does; movies like this strike a chord within all of us! I do think it's a relatable film, even though all the main characters are fish. lol. Both grownups and kids can both equally enjoy this - it's a great feel-good movie, with decent animation, with even some good lessons in it, especially about honesty & family.And the soundtrack is unbelievably good, too - timeless & catchy, I've got a bunch of the songs on my iPod, not just for nostalgia sake, but because they're COOL! 'Car Wash', 'Got To Be Real', or 'Get It Together,' they're all so awesome!In the end, I'm glad this film exists, and I recommend every family to own a copy of it!8/10",8,1,4,22 October 2014
The Godfather," Groundhog Day >>>>>>>>>> The Godfather
","Everyone's saying this overrated film is one of 'the greatest films of all time' - NOPE! I'm saying it's Groundhog Day!WHY?? Because that one is a GOOD film - with meaning, creativity, fun, likability, and enjoyment. Unlike this, it makes you WANT to do fun things like it features, when watching it. Watching 'the Godfather', I feel, 'No, I don't want to do or watch these things'.Most of this film is rather just boring & confusing! Everything is shot in the dark (or with a dark filter); you have to make sure you've got something else to do while viewing this *masterpiece.* It's way too long. And it's certainly NOT 'flawless' - I've spotted a WHOLE bunch of flaws with this flick, that they'd have to be put into many notes! Remember, no film is without flaws. A summary of the flaws with this film are confusing story lines, corrupt characters, crime, violence, some filthy language, bad attitudes, even the false cult of Catholicism being featured, rudeness, mind-aching distressing corrupt plot inconsistencies, or scenes that just don't make sense or just annoy the bazzerk out of you!I couldn't care less if almost all critics everywhere have given it glowing reviews, I don't care if it's generally considered a 'masterpiece', and I don't care if it has a 9.2 out of 10 on IMDb. I can't believe I fell for such a deceiving look. I'm sad that they've refused to see how horrible it is. The fact is, films have quite the tendency to be either underrated or overrated these days. Seriously, this should be turned around! All the attention towards the 'Godfather' series should be given instead towards 'Groundhog Day'; all the awards given to the 'Godfather' series should be instead towards 'Groundhog Day'. It's THAT good! Please check it out!And plus, Marlon Brando's brought into this flick, and given one of the stupidest accents in film history; sounding so nauseated and drunk, with his chin thrust out so far, it makes me think he's turning into Jim Carrey. This film's also one of the biggest reasons why I don't care about Al Pacino as an actor; how he almost always seems to have a fetish for hardcore violence, swearing, and playing all-round unromantic, unpopular, and unlikable characters.Undoubtedly it was this flick that started a whole film career of mistakes for Al Pacino - I guess he's kind of cool, just not as much as people make him to be.Though to be fair, I do give credit to this film for not including one f-bomb at all.But overall, I think this is certainly one of the worser movies I have seen, and I'm GLAD I didn't watch it growing up.2/10PS: I'm a movie buff who tries to like every film I see.",1,3,22,6 November 2014
