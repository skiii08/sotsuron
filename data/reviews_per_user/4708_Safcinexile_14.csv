Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Sunk To The Murky Depths!
","Saw this film last night with my hubby, I have to be honest and say this is one of the worst movies I have seen this year! The only one that was worth watching was Depp and even then there was no passion in his eyes doing this role that was in the previous movies. There was no screen chemistry between his co stars, Cruz just ran around like a headless chicken, looking as if she had no idea what she was doing!The storyline itself was much to be desired, felt like I wanted to fall asleep, in fact I had to nudge my hubby a couple of times as he actually did nod off during it! If you have a bad case of insomnia, this is the movie for you!If there is to be another one, then it had better be better, otherwise somebody should lock it away in Davey Jones' locker forever!I grudgingly have given this 2/10 only because I cannot do one and a half.....",2,1,1,16 June 2011
Captain Marvel," Not perfect but still an enjoyable Marvel film.
","First off just want to say I thought it was a lovely tribute to Stan Lee at the start, I think the cinema must have been dusty as I had something in my eye which caused them to water.....As for the movie itself, I quite enjoyed it, granted it is not perfect but it is still a Marvel movie at its core. I did found it took a bit get going and seemed slow, but it still kept my attention until it actually did pick up pace the story kicked off.Brie Larson and Samuel L Jackson on screen chemistry was a joy to watch, I am sure they had fun making this, would be interesting to see the bloopers of these two. Jude Law's character was a bit hit and miss for me, didn't seem to grab me as a villain.The surprise of the film for me was the Skrulls, I expected them to be truly evil and unsympathetic like they are in the mainstream Marvel universe, so I was surprised and actually liked how the Directors twisted it to make them the oppressed race and for the audience to actually sympathise for them.Oh the other surprise for me on the real reason on how Fury lost his eye...... losing it because a cat/alien guard scratched his eye out certainly not one of things I would have ever dreamed or thought of :-) :-) :-)For me this movie was a good addition to the Marvel Cinema Cosmic Universe, along with GOTG, so I expect Marvel will exploring the cosmic side with their focus now in Captain Marvel's exploration of the cosmos.Let the Endgame begin......",7,1,4,8 March 2019
This Is the End," One seriously f***ed up movie! Avoid at all costs!
","Went to see this film today, expecting to see an enjoyable comedy - boy was I wrong on both counts! Acting (what there was of it) was wooden & terrible. Every sentence that was uttered contained the 'F' word. Not sure how drug references they squeezed in but they managed! Surprised Emma Watson agreed to do this movie, sure she's regretting to now!Unfortunately I decided to persevere through it. Two hours of my life I'll never see again.Avoid at all costs!",1,26,55,4 July 2013
Spider-Man: Homecoming," It's About Time They Did It Right
","I always thought it was about time they did proper Spider-Man like he was originally in the comic and this is although not perfect is as close as we are going to get (for now), They have learned their mistakes from previous poor incarnations by going back to basics and showing him like he was in the comic, a typical 15 year old teenager. The other thing I liked what they showed was his inexperience, unlike other Spidey movies where he looked as if he knew what to do as soon as he got his powers, here we see him landing badly, unsure of himself etcAlthough I did think it was a bit slow to start off and took a bit get some momentum. Tom Holland although we got to see him briefly in Civil War seems to be perfectly cast as the Peter Parker we grew up reading. For me Michael Keation was brilliantly cast as the villain, literally stole any scene he appeared in and was able to portray Adrian Toomes in a way that the audience could sympathise with him. Robert Downey junior appeared just enough not to steal the movie away.Unfortunately I felt Marisa Tomei was poor casting as May Parker (although she is stunning for her age), just felt she looked too young, as May is supposed to be a lot older & frailer.The other thing I liked was we finally got to see who cleaned up the mess after the chitauri invasion In New York, and we finally get to see Damage Control on the screen.Looks like Spider-Man's big screen future is in good hands, especially if the rumours about the upcoming Venom spin off is true.#Thwip 'nuf said true believers",7,1,11,6 July 2017
Ant-Man," A 'small' movie with a big punch......
","Out of all the Marvel films this was probably the one that intrigued me the most, since I first read of it's development. As a bit of a Marvel nerd/buff/fan I was disappointed Ant Man never made it into first phase of Marvel films, as Hank Pym/Ant Man was one of the original founders, but after seeing this I was glad they took their time.Paul Rudd & Michael Douglas were a good choice as they appear to work well together on screen, their on screen chemistry was a nice surprise. Rudd managed to provide comic relief but also carry himself during the more serious moments.It's a shame Edgar Wright wasn't able to complete his vision for this movie, would have been interesting to see judging from what I have read, but Reed was able to bring his own stamp with a approach.The film itself I felt started off slow but gradually picked up steam for a enjoyable ride. The only fault I have was I felt Corey Stoll/Darren Cross was a bit one dimensional didn't bring across the presence for screen villain compared to Hiddlestone' Loki (we have been spoilt there). But didn't spoil my enjoyment of this movie.Personally I would have liked to see a Hank Pym & Janet Van Dyne Antman/Wasp movie but I can understand Marvel point that going off Pym's issues in the comic (mental breakdowns, spouse abuse, attempted suicide etc) that he wasn't suitable for a family film. Hopefully judging from the mid credit scene we will get to see Hope take up the Wasp mantle and have a Wasp/Antman partnership in the next movie, or even sooner when we see Paul Rudd in Civil War next year.Looks like Marvel have another winner on their hands, again like last Summer's Guardians Of The Galaxy, a enjoyable funny movie that doesn't disappoint.Excelsior n'uff said!",8,1,6,19 July 2015
Split," A Masterclass from McAvoy
","Simply put what a brilliant film, McAvoy's performance was just a joy to behold, intense and gripping. It is quite an intense film, that really towards the end had me on the edge of my seat. Wasn't quite sure where it was going with the three female prisoners, but once they were gradually separated and we were left with Anya Taylor-Joy's Casey, who gave us sympathetic point of view as we were left to watch her battle of wills with 'The Horde'.Love the little twist at the end that ties it and implies it's sequel to the previous Shyamalan film, Unbreakable, that sort of hints that we may get third movie involving Bruce Willis' David Dunn.For me this felt Shyamalan was back on form and if we do get a follow-up to make this a trilogy hopefully we will get see to David V Goliath clash of epic proportions of David Dunn v The Horde/Beast.Time up the ante and bring it on Mr Shyamalan.",8,4,14,29 January 2017
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Your mission should you choose to accept it... is try and not to fall asleep!
","Went to see it last night, after looking forward to it, but unfortunately I have to say that it is probably one of the worst MI films to date!The film virtually has no storyline that you can follow or make any sense from, relies on ludicrous stunts and action sequences and seem to full of more technobabble than an ST:TNG episode!Acting, whatever there was, was wooden and one dimensional. Even Tom Cruise/Ethan Hunt's bright shiny teeth couldn't save this film, you would have thought all he to do was smile and the villains would have been stunned, job done! Simon Pegg tried pull of a straight role, but seemed to look blank as confused as much as the audience. The film's main villain, was typically one dimensional, all he needed was a cloak and evil laugh then he was set.Unfortunately I cannot delete the film from my memory as easy they did with the stolen data.Also looks like we have another MI film to look forward to, looks like Tom Cruise is trying to beat Hugh Jackman's & Robert Downey Jnr's record for playing the same character in film series, unlike them he has to rely sacrificing a decent storyline to do it.Just another excuse to get as much blood out of the stone while they can.",3,42,90,2 August 2015
Inside Out," Listen to your inner voice/child.....
","I really like Pixar movies, always have, not ashamed to say as 40+ married adult that I have most of them on DVD and we don't even have kids!So wife was working last night, so home alone so I did what any guy does - go to the cinema. Was wanting to go and see Inside Out since I first heard about it, as I thought it sounded like a good idea for a movie, unfortunately because we don't have kids, I had to work out a valid excuse to see it. So I tossed a coin to decide, lost the coin so listened to my inner child and went to see it.What a lovely feel good movie. Was pleasantly surprised that some of the humour was aimed at adults (judging by the amount of adult laughs I could hear). Granted it's not one of Pixar's best but I think it ranks up as being a good animated film.Character of Riley came across as a good Pixar character, listening to her own emotions/characters - Joy, Fear, Anger, Disgust and Sadness. For me Sadness was probably my favourite, as I actually laughed out loud with her. Joy for me I found a bit annoying and came across as a bit of a control freak, which was probably the idea! Loved the scene at the dinner table where the mum & dad are talking, mum is trying to attract dad's attention but he's day dreaming of football, like me when my wife talks to me!Film starts of well with the family moving, Riley having to deal with the turmoil and losing her friends and home, then because of an accident which 'seperates' Joy & Sadness from her. She has to listen to Anger, Fear & Disgust. This is where for me I felt it was heading to a dark direction, started to wonder where the film was heading, but was glad to say that it ended nicely (which caused me to have s lump in my throat).Was trying to spot the Pixar Easter eggs but couldn't spot them, although I did manage to hear the distinctive voice of Pixar stalwart John Ratzenberger, a Pixar film wouldn't be the same without him!If you want a nice family feel good movie, listen to your inner voice and go and see it.Oh, one more thing loved the mini move just before the start - Lava Story (I think), don't why but I think I had a bit of dust in my eye at the end of it ;-)",8,1,19,26 July 2015
Avengers: Infinity War," Absolutely breathtaking and visually gorgeous
","Watched this film at a mid-night screening this morning.After having a bit of sleep and some time to process what I watched earlier, I can honestly say the Film was absolutely breathtaking at times just didn't seem to let up with all emotion I was feeling while watching. Character interplay was spot on too, adding humour at the right time. Also couldn't help feel a bit sympathy towards Thanos, could understand his reasoning even though his actions were a bit self-centred, although I couldn't help feel for him what he had to kill Gamora to get the soul stone. Her death and Loki's death really hit home how high the stakes have been raised.For me one of the biggest surprises of the film was the return of a character thought dead (The Red Skull)Didn't actually expect the ending, had thought with it being a Marvel Film, the heroes would save the day at the last minute, but no Marvel when down the dark route and let Thanos succeed in wiping out half of the universe, which for me makes the film even more special.The Directors/Marvel have set the bar with this film and are going to have to pull out all the stops next year if they want the next part to be just as good.",10,24,73,26 April 2018
La La Land," A Nice Feel Good Film
","Wasn't quit sure what to make of it when I saw the trailer, but I have say it's a film that actually pleasantly surprised me. Basically it's nice feel good film, which had the feel of a Hollywood musical from the 1950s didn't have the same impact but I guess they were trying to give it modern day look, which didn't quite work but for me is still a decent film, that has your foot tapping at times during the musical numbers. Started off well with a grand opening but I felt a bit flat in the middle but ended on a high, although the ending felt a bit bittersweetNormally not that keen on Ryan Gosling but he actually surprised me in this film, he does have some acting talent after all! Emma Stone as usual just seems to light up the screen with her presence and played off well against Gosling.If you wanting a film that offers you an alternative to bloods, guts, guns and swearing this is for you. Will have you singing to yourself as you leave the cinema.I am a sucker for a musical :-)",8,1,5,19 January 2017
Thor," Awesome movie!
","I saw this movie yesterday, cannot really add any more to the rest of the reviews below, apart from saying. Awesome film - 'nuf said true believer!Thor has set the pace and raised the bar to how superhero movies should be. Captain America and The Avengers have a lot to live up to now. Like the reviewer below has already said I was bit sceptical about Chris Hemsworth being cast against Anthony Hopkins and Natalie Portman, need not have worried as held his own against the heavy weights!Kenneth Branagh's directing was a beauty to behold, you could tell he knew his subject, especially how he manage to depict the beautiful looking Asgard. Loved his interpretation of the rainbow bridge.Bring on The Avengers!",9,7,13,26 April 2011
Wonder Woman," Finally the Amazonian is on the big screen
","Well it took them long enough to put her on the big screen but worth the wait (about damn time!) Probably the best DCU movie so far. DC's holy trinity finally up on the big screen, after Superman & Batman hogging the limelight, we finally get to see the Amazonian take the baton from them and show the men how a woman (a wondrous one too) can make proper super hero film,Grew up watching Lynda Carter making the role her own, so she left some big shoes to fill but Gal Gadot managed to make the role her own but still showing the same humanity and times a touch of vulnerability.Patty Jenkins has shown what it takes to make a decent comic book movie, looks like the character is in very capable hands and actually managed to put her own stamp on the DCU. To be honest I have the previous DCU films quite lacking in something.For a comic book film, it actually has a decent story-line, good action scenes but still able to keep the story going in the subdued scenes and had characters you actually cared about, which is more than could be said for the film it followed, Batman v Superman.Will definitely be a movie I would quite happy to pay to see again without hesitation.",9,12,24,3 June 2017
X-Men: First Class," X makes it Mark.
","I have to be honest and say when I first heard that they were doing an X-Men prequel, I was quite sceptical as we have seen other movie prequels that were pretty dire (a certain trilogy springs to mind), but I need not have worried as they certainly pulled it off.For people like me who are fans of Marvel and been following X-Men for years there were perhaps some niggly points but I had to just push them aside and accept the fact that the X movies are set in their own continuity.James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender made the roles their own, with the odd nod to Patrick Stewart and Sir Ian McKellin. The rest of cast managed to hold their own too.The storyline itself was good but had a couple of plot holes. For me my favourite part of the movie was a rather memorable (and colourful) cameo, which certainly got the biggest laugh from the rest of the audience too.From what I have if this movie does well they will make another, they have no worries there for me it looks like it will do well this summer, but for me still cannot beat Thor for summer blockbuster title.",9,0,2,5 June 2011
Minions," Okay but a very poor prequel
","I love both Despicable Me movies, so went to see this with a rather optimistic open mind, unfortunately I was probably expecting too much as felt a bit let down. There were a couple of laugh out loud moments but to be honest I thought it was lacking something from it's superior Daddy!Probably enough in the movie for a child to laugh at (which to be honest is what it's aimed at), but for an adult its a bit of a disappointment, which is shame as I love animated movies.I have to say I think I enjoyed the trailer for the Secret Life Of Pets more, which was shown at the start :-)",6,8,15,2 July 2015
