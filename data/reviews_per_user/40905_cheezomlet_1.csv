Scarface," One of my all-time favorites!
","This movie from start to finish is one of the finest all-around movies ever made. There is a perfect blend realism and Hollywood. Al Pachino is great as usual, Michele Phifer's first major role.. Well Done!!! A movie you will watch many times through the years... that is if you like 'Pulp Fiction' type of movies. This movie won many awards, the use of the 'F' word over one hundred times is one of them LOL.. Very powerful storyline, Strong acting, excellent choice of actors. I own the anniversary DVD, I loved watching the actors commenting on the movie, I learned a lot about the movie and it made me like it even more. Funny to see how it was rated R on the first cut, then he made more cuts, then they would not drop it below an X rating.. so he went with the original cut which was set at an R rating to get it in the theaters. If you have never seen it, rent or buy it. NOT for everyone.",10,0,1,19 February 2006
