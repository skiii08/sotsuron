Hereditary," Great music, good suspense, beautiful acting and of course a very cheesy ending!
","While the music and the suspense of the movie bears the whole story (which is very poorly told) the super performance of Toni Collette and Gabriel Byrne makes it worth watching. 
It is a mix of the demonic, ghost and exorcism kind of story but fails to deliver at the end and all of that just vanishes, as if the writers and the director just wanted to wrap it up and go on with it.",6,2,4,22 August 2018
