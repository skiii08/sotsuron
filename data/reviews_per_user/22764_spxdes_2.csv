The Young Victoria," England and history deserves better !
","This is a movie that deserves a better direction, specially a much better art direction. The history of the Queen Victoria is fascinating and deserves a better director and better casting. The role of King Leopold from Belgium was given to Thomas Kretschmann. Could this be given to a worst actor ?! Hard to believe how someone can be so least convincing. Some great actors nonetheless (Jim Broadbent, Mark Strong) save the movie and make it worth while but still, this important period of England and Europe history deserves a much better casting and directing. Stil a movie to see, maybe on DVD at home instead on a theather !",6,1,2,8 August 2010
The Secret in Their Eyes," A powerful story with great acting and great directing. A must see.
","This was a revealing and fascinating movie. I would never believe this was so good. There is nothing I would change in this movie: the cast is perfect, they are absolutely brilliant on their roles, the dialogues and the intricate bureaucratic world of the courts and laws in a Latin Country is so real and honest. The history is as well fascinating and the way its reveal to us in the perfect timing. The characterization of the young and old leading actors is impressive, so simple but so brutal and well done. Ricard Darin is brilliant the director Juan Jos√© Campanella is a director to keep a close look This was one of the best movies I saw recently, even the small funny moments, which are not many, but they can be brilliant and so funny (the judge Fortuna Lacalle revealing he knows that Esposito was in that town looking for Gomez). This is a must see movie that confirms that the power of good acting, good directing and a good story with rich dialogues can overcome any multimillion dollar blockbuster made in Hollywood.",9,2,3,26 August 2010
