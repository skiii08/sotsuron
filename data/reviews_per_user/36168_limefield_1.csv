Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Depp steals show as fun outshines originality
","Personally I have been a big fan of the POTC series and have seen the first and best many a time. You may think I am a big kid but being a 13 year old you are allowed these privileges without receiving too much ridicule .The new film 'On Stranger Tides' was a chance to redeem the series after what many saw as two below par sequels (I personally enjoyed them). The fourth instalment does not disappoint, with use of the dependable Johnny Depp and the classic POTC formula used in the first film to rescue its few faults. It also helps how it is a separate film to any other and gets all of the story done in one go. The effects are not as impressive as 1,2&3 yet it makes up for this with a witty script. The film does turn a bit Indiana Jones towards the end but there are enough twists and turns along the way to keep you guessing, although predictability does tend to set in every so often. Ian McShane and Geoffrey Rush put in solid performances as does Penelope Cruz, but it is Depp who steals the show again. We may have seen him 4 times now but I don't think that we will ever get tired of him.",5,3,6,18 May 2011
