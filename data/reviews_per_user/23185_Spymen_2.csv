Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Don't know
","All I can say is that this is a good movie.  The special effects and all. Natalie Portman is good at being a queen.  Ray Park is good at being Darth Maul/bad guy.  All his flips and all.  It's a good movie.  Not the best Star Wars series though.  My favorite is Empire Strikes Back.  That one was good. It tells you that Luke Skywalker's father is Darth Vador, and etc.  Keep up the good work Mr. Lucas.",Null,0,0,14 July 1999
Saving Private Ryan," Don't know
","This is a good movie.  I agree, I think that this is the greatest war movie of all time, yet.  I like the way how Steven Spielberg made the bombs exploding, the bullets flying, the people getting hit.  It looks very real. Its like you are in the movie, fighting.  Very sad though.  The way soldiers died.  I'm glad that Tom Hanks was in that movie.  Same with Barry Pepper, and all the other actors/actresses.  This is my favorite Steven Spielberg movie.  They go threw the battlefield just to save one boy, private James Francis Ryan.",Null,0,0,14 July 1999
