Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Sherlock Bond 006
","Author: unbekannternutzer from Switzerland this movie is a(nother) disappointing proof of the impression that most of the money in movie business is in the hand of the wrong people.this has nothing to do with anything anyone would associate with the sherlock holmes that has been main character of real literature. there is no connection visible whatsoever to that kind of clever developed character.dialog is stupid, unrealistic and scripted to a point that makes it unbelievably disappointing that the makers obviously think that the audience is completely dumbed down and wont recognize a pile of verbal garbage that is desperately modified to sound good.characters are completely unbelievable, shallow and exaggerated in a way one would expect to see in a comic movie. with the difference that in those movies the components fit together to create something interesting at least. this movie fails miserably there. it's a mess.story is non existent, calling it an excuse for the action scenes would give it too much credit. they are not even trying to do that.the action scenes you would expect from a super-hero movie. and that's what it actually is. it's iron man in medieval times without that metal suit trying to do some kind of parody of sherlock holmes. this is the only point of view that would make it work somehow.the actors are trying but it's a pointless effort with this direction and script.there is a lot more that is just wrong about this movie. i don't have words for it at the moment. it feels like the mess that they call movie has left my brain in a similarly messed up state.i am actually shocked to see this average rating it has at the moment. it cant be right. it just cant.---> This is just what I was thinking op the movie when it finally ended, James Bond the previous century!!! Nothing of Sherlock Holmes, Sherlock Holmes that isn't using his brains but brute power to stop the bad???",2,10,19,22 April 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," Totally agree with Cyborg Abhi comment
","I was to waiting for the new Spiderman and hoped it would continue the story made with Spiderman 1, 2 and 3. Remaking Spiderman 1 I don't understand and changing the story with the real storyline...don't understand, totally disappointed with the actors they had no feeling with the original characters....My vote 4 out of 10 and that because I'm a big Spiderman fan and hope they would go back to the previous cast and simply make Spiderman 4...Author: Cyborg Abhi from India *** This review may contain spoilers *** I've been a fan of Spiderman since childhood. In fact, he has been my favorite superhero. I liked Spiderman 1, 2 and 3; watched Spiderman 3 twice, despite many reviewers bashing it.So it's natural I was waiting eagerly for The Amazing Spiderman. I was more eager because this movie was rebooting the Spiderman franchise with new cast that included Indian actor, Irfan Khan and it was getting released in India before US! Unfortunately, it turned out to be a big disappointment. It was like they didn't make a Spiderman movie, but a caricature-remake or a spoof of it. Bad script, confused and weak characters, bad direction and bad editing are some of the major flaws. Story was too bland, no spice, no excitement.The important scenes where Peter gets bitten or hones his skills or makes his suit have been hurried and short, while the irrelevant scenes have been dragged.Spiderman gets beaten, defeated, injured repeatedly. In fact, the audience was laughing hard on the repeated scenes of him coming home all thrashed and bruised and his aunt talking to him about it. He keeps removing his mask for just anybody and that's not very Spiderman-like.Most action scenes were non-thrilling. In a scene where Spiderman rescues a boy from a falling and burning car, he wastes almost 5 minutes trying to convince Jack (the boy) to be brave, climb up and hold his hand. He even gives the boy his mask, but the boy doesn't follow him. So in the end he has to throw his spider-thread to pull Jack up. He could have done that already and spared us of that boredom.It was just an example. Most encounters between the lizard-man and Spiderman were equally boring, dragged and nonsensical.There were a lot of loose ends and missing links in the story. Like the story of Peter's parents was never shown, but the characters kept mentioning it. Dr. Ratha talks about some Mr. Osbourne, but neither the man nor his story was shown. Maybe they're keeping it for the sequel, but the confusion totally spoiled this movie. A lot of inconsistencies were there too. Sometimes things stick to Peter's hands and break by little force, sometimes they don't.The romance between Peter/Spiderman and Gwen looked lukewarm and forced. The scene where the burglar kills Peter's uncle looked awkward and disconnected like many other scenes.Andrew Garfield didn't look much convincing either as nerdy Peter Parker or as Spiderman. He was good in The Social Network but a disappointment in this movie. In many body-close-up shots he was bending forward apparently to hide his penis-line from showing in the tight-suit. That made the already weak Spiderman look even weaker. Since when have Hollywood actors become this bashful? Irfan Khan appeared in just 3 short scenes. He was more like an extra. But the audience welcomed him with a bout of whistling! Everyone seemed to be waiting anxiously for the movie to end, which ends after further boring you for some time after the defeat of the villain. So much I wish, they had made Spiderman 4 with Tobey Maguire instead of this disaster.I might as well watch Rajnikant's Robot now",4,1,5,17 September 2012
The Reader," One of so many
","Well, acting in this movie was great. I enjoyed the movie because of this, but this movie is once again an attempt of Jews to sympathies with them, what happened in the Second World War, as if there is no ending in these story's. Why do they need us to remind what happened...is this a way to justify themselves what they do in Israel to the Muslim's? I personally don't believe that 6 million Jews were killed. If I think of 6 million...that's to much to be done in those years, and why do we forget that there were also Gypsy's and handicapped people??? Why no movie about them? As if the war was all about the Jews and as if it gets worse whit every movie they make!",5,1,11,3 March 2009
