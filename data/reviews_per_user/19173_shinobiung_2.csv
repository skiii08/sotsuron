Lucky Number Slevin," How people can LIKE this film is BEYOND me.
","Ben Ghandi Kingsley as crimeboss no.1, Morgan Shawshank Freeman as crime boss no.2, Lucy Cockeyed Lui as the most annoying character in cinema history (Shia Lebeof not inc), Bruce same old same old Willis as the 'play them against each other' gangster role. Anyone starting to see a problem with the cast. Anyone who has seen any of them play their previous roles can appreciate THESE ARE NOT THE RIGHT CHARACTERS to a gangland drama.I half expect Kingsley to come out with some 'lets make peace' metaphor when he starts ordering the executions, and Freeman to start narrating some penguin march when he starts threatening in such a mediocre unbelievable manner, I can imagine all 4 of them laughing all the way to the bank as they took the producers money for a half arsed job. The 4 of them should know better than to take on such a cliché script with 'I wannabe gangster' written all over it.The violence is so unbelievable, the fight scenes seem comical, the film set looks cardboard, everything from the clothes down to the props just looks so out of place. It was painful to watch it for more than 30 mins. Its almost like they tried a Sin City type of atmosphere by using cheap sets and unrealistic acting roles. I still cant decide if they used cardboard or CGI for the sky scrapers. Its REALLY that bad.",1,8,19,16 February 2012
Arrival," What a crock of sh*t
",American gov striving to prevent the rest of the world notably CHINA from attacking the aliens before attempts at peace?A single mother NOT trying to prevent their children from seeing their father?Mother communicates with aliens best because she is WOMAN! ! !Evil men just want to destroy the universe ! ! This film is filled with more cliché and gov propaganda than a feminist rally.And the arrogance of the producers to actually submit this for academy awards. I was actually insulted by this film's belief this pile of propaganda could be seen as anything other than.,1,89,202,16 January 2017
