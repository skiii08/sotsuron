The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," From Bad To Worse
","I was in the middle of the movie and suddenly it looked like the matrix story but in an awful way. I closed my eyes few times and was about to leave the room. I am not sure why the decision to cut the movie in half other than making money. They knew that the story is broken and the only way to make money out of these poor kids is by doing this.It was lame, boring and very slow. No action, no romance, no suspense, and no story.I think what they should have done is to end her role in part I. After her web scandal, she lost lots of credibility and her caricature as a model was destroyed. The upcoming role should be given to her sister, and then they might have something to grab on in the upcoming years. It would be hot, challenging and differently tons of suspense.",2,27,39,26 November 2014
