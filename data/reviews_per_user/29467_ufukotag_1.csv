Antz," Alienation of a member from his society may be funny...
","It is a cartoon meaning two things: First it shows us a typical cartoon. A cartoon of children..Main character Faces with some fun and this make audience have some fun. However, the cartoon has another face. As can be seen in the book of George Orwell called 1984, there can be a guy distinguished, alienated himself from the society even though the society was established with very strong ties. It is interesting that, there can be another member like himself and they find each other by ignoring some strict rules. As we saw it in 1984, same thing occurs in this cartoon. Being bored of her life, Princess Bala joins to workers entertainment. And the `extreme` life of the couples gets start. As the time passes, strict rules become useless and some liberal ideas spread through the society. Moreover, we see some lovers from different classes. These are some examples of the destruction of a totalitarian society in the cartoon. And we see many fascist rulers like General who wants to create a pure colony in our world. This cartoon is a very good example of this idea. As in the real world this idea collapses at the end. Finally i can add that there is a lot to learn how to make all the members enough satisfied. May be there is no way...",7,7,13,2 December 2002
