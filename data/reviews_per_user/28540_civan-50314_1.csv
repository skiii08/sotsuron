Blade Runner 2049," teaser alert !!!It˙s a shame that they filmed this
","First movie in a long time that I have to say is total crap!Worst movie i saw in a long long time , OK maybe I am being too harsh because I expected (to be honest I don't know what I expected but not what we got) and waited this movie since I heard first legitimate rumour that its in production This is only second movie that I fell in sleep in theater during movie and I wasn't only one almost half of cinema got out after half an hour an half of that later my nephew and I only stayed because we fell in sleep and we were not only ones , such a shame maybe the problem is in me because Blade Runner (the original one) is one of my dearest movie, even today (and I am 40 years old ) i watch it at least once a year so this sequel and thats what this is full sequel storyline and maybe that is the problem I˙m not a kind of person to ask for my money back in theaters )is it a play a movie or whatever ) but I seriously wanted my money back, I took my nephew who is twelve with me who didn't see the one and only B.R. and now I cant get him to watch first movie cant get him to read the novel 'DO ANDROIDS DREAM OF ELECTRIC SHEEP' by Phillip Dick so my rating is 1 because there is no zero for anyone planing on going to cinema to watch it ( by my opinion and after all said and done I am one person only , skip this one watch it on TV in future or nrt don't waste 2 hours of your life on this crap better get a book and read it , it˙s short story mad novel but it˙s excellent you have to forgive me for being this harsh on movie without saying one word of the plot itself or acting but to be honuest nobody is gonna watch this because the actors and plot I wish i read more revies I don't know where they came from I don't get why H. Ford played in it actually i do money was good and his last couple of movies goes for money i don't know is he filling his bank account or cant get descent part after 25 years hes going back to parts that made his career first Indiana Jones then Han solo (at least they killed him) than Blade Runner for that three parts he made money that starting Hollywood a list actors could dream of only at the this time of their career.This and last year was disaster for a list movies sequels superheros and maybe a few movies got by unnoticed because of way they pushed these movies sequels final chapters at least and that we can only hope this is over they did the same thing with t2 (trainspotting2 but the plot there was descent acting Doesn't smell funny nor it smells nice( its a Serbian quote looses in translation) So if you are looking for great movie this is not the one! Again one mans opinion or even 100 men doesn't mean you wont like it ,but who likes to read better tke original novel and read it and wait for niht when IT is showing maybe that remake is worth watcing hes got a good chance first movie from ˙90s was TV movie from two parts bu excellent one only ending was disappointment but goes for readers and I look forward how they made grand finale in this one (cause its tricky for SF Horror and those genres when movies are based on book .This wasn't review perse for movie cause I got nothing good to say about it but for all the remakes and sequels 20 + years old thats my opinion on movie remember you may love it.",1,9,23,13 October 2017
