The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," You People Are High
","You people can't sit and watch them in a bunker for 2 hours for your life! I know the acting is not good, but at least they can act at all. I literally don't care about the plot, and if you do you are high. I know it isn't a satisfying movie, but at least I've rated a 10 and haven't even watched the movie!",10,1,5,24 September 2019
Spider-Man 2," Good Movie, Just as Good as The First One
","It was just as good as the first with similar scenes and familiar action, and also didn't fail to bring the satisfaction it offered.",10,0,0,3 June 2020
Spider-Man 3," Almost as Good as The First Two
",I don't know why people rated this movie so bad. It had just as good scenes as the first two and also offered a future meme.,9,0,0,3 June 2020
Spider-Man," Great Movie, Classic
",I've watched this movie many times over my childhood and it has never failed to bring me the satisfaction that it offers.,10,0,0,3 June 2020
Joker," Already Going For Great Movie, Even If It Isn't
","All of you people on the Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, and more garbage places for critics, are just too opinionated about movie ratings. You try to think about every aspect known to be possible and think really deep, to make mixed and low ratings. You have to realize that the people that rate this movie don't care about any of that stuff. So once you rate this movie low on the Metacritic ratings, you lessen the chance of more and more people going to see this movie. Which makes the profits for the movie bad, and makes the producers sad.",10,1,2,9 October 2019
