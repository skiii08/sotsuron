Blade Runner 2049," Long and empty
","The protagonist being definitively a replicant himself made it less compelling for me to watch. It was like watching two computers play chess against one another rather than a showdown between a human chess master and a computer. Who cares which computer wins? Yeah yeah, questions of AI and debating what is and isn't life can be entertained, and were successfully in the first Blade Runner, but not this one. I just didn't find it engaging enough to care either way.And the fact that Sean Young's character could only be worked into it by making Sean appear young via CGI was just offensive. Why can only male actors, such as Ford, be allowed to age, but female actors like Young can only appear as young? An example of modern misogyny, in my opinion. Had some interesting effects, but overall a long dull experience. Go see the original and not waste time with this one.",2,1,3,13 December 2017
