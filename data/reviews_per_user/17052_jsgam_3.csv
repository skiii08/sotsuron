Vertigo," The Paramount of Hitchcock films
","I'll never forget my first time seeing this one. I watched it when I was 16 and was enamored by he suspenseful romance.While many will cite either Psycho or North by Northwest as the greatest-of-all Hitchcock films, my vote would go to Vertigo. Jimmy Stewart works so well with the classy Kim Novak. The colorful style (especially in regard for a film made 62 years ago) fits so well in a world of romance. I personally love the scene in the beginning where Stewart is trailing Novak in the car and we see San Francisco in all of its vintage glory.Vertigo is arguably the greatest detective story, even beating Polanski's Chinatown in my opinion. This film has everything from a grade-a star list, the Hitchcock fun, the excitement, the drama, the beautiful shots of Golden Gate and the psychedelic paranoia scene with Jimmy Stewart's head in focus (it may look a little silly by today's standards, but it shows how the film is a great vestige to the past.With regards to the paramount of suspense, the horrid ending with the nun ringing the bell as his lover falls to her death, we know full well that Jimmy would never recover from a situation like this in real life. We may think of classic films as being more tame with regards to content, but this is a really disturbing story in its own way and we understand that Jimmy probably spent many years in Mental Health Hospitals coupled with intense weekly therapy.",10,3,3,1 May 2020
The Great Dictator," Arguably one of the greatest messages of all-time
","It should be said that Chaplin exclaimed later in life that he would not have made the film had he known the true nature of The Holocaust, however he was probably just as ignorant as most of the Americans at the time.Chaplin plays the two roles here, one as a Hitler parody and one as a Jewish barber who suffers from amnesia. The film has a great opening sequence, with a close-up shot to show an older Charlie Chaplin. He had been in the business over twenty years and to still see him in the game at age 50 is very cool. The opening is very funny with eye-candy scenes such as Chaplin getting lost and winding up with the enemy, the plane flying upside down and the bullets following him. Chaplin still incorporated the silent-film visual aesthetic, but happened to add sound to this one. it would have been interesting to see more of this style.The Great Dictator was ultimately a warning about Hitler, with the famous scene where Chaplin is dancing with the big globe. He had the world in his hands, quite literally. Chaplin's Jewish character gives one of the most heartwarming speeches at the end of the film involving Hitler preaching that we are men and we should fight against our own enslavement. The speech is arguably the most famous Chaplin moment ever.The Great Dictator may not be his most famous film, but it is arguably one of the most important pictures of all time. Messages to this effect don't appear to often in modern movies, with many films nowadays being made for the commercial profit or the homogeneous pseudo-intellectual 'views' of some directors. This movie is about the heart, not the money.'Let us Unite!'",10,0,0,13 March 2020
Singin' in the Rain," Very sweet
","Everyone loves this movie, there is no way that you cannot. Like The Wizard of Oz, it shows that film can be a creation of positive creation and we don't need horrible violence to have a film be considered great.I think what's also worth noting is that Kelle had a 103 Degree fever when he danced and sang in this picture, it shows the effort that was put into film back in the day. The determination is striking, even though he probably should have taken a sick day, or hired Malcolm McDowell.It's also great to watch this with our grandparents, because it is a safe-for-work film.",10,0,0,12 May 2020
