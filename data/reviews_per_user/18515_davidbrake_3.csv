Blade Runner 2049," Worth it for BR fans - visually impressive but overlong & not entirely coherent
","I thought it was visually impressive and thought provoking in parts (especially the relationship between replicant Joe and 'Joi' his holographic AI 'lover'). I did think it was over-long though and a little too addicted to its own spectacle. I found some of the violence excessive too - and my cinema turned up the soundtrack to ear-pummelling levels. I don't think the whole story makes sense even within the world's logic, though it makes a poetic kind of sense. Definitely worth seeing on the big screen if you are a fan of the original. I suspect non-fans might be a bit bemused...",7,4,9,22 October 2017
Memento," A movie you have to watch twice
","I saw it when it first came out and was on the edge of my seat for the whole film, all the while trying to unravel what had happened and what was to come (because the whole premise of the movie as you presumably know is that it runs backwards). 18 years later I finally got around to watching it again and it was just as entertaining knowing the ending as I watched, engrossed, to see how everything came to pass. Not just a film that rewards two watchings but one that demands them. A tour de force and for my money still Nolan's best work.",10,1,1,3 July 2018
Signs," Expected enjoyable messing with my head - got pseudo-mystical SF claptrap
","Having mostly enjoyed earlier works by M. Night Shyamalan because of their surprise endings which put the whole work into a different perspective, I stuck with this right through to the end hoping that the increasingly ludicrous plot would turn out to be explained as some kind of hallucination or something. Imagine my disappointment when the incredibly stupid, unconvincing alien invasion turns out to be just what it seemed to be! Oh, and Mel Gibson's acting is wooden, and the faith vs reason 'subplot' underlying the film has about as deep as a shallow puddle. The film neither scared me nor made me think. I want 106 minutes of my life back.",1,2,3,6 April 2006
