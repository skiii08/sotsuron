Sucker Punch," This Film Rocks With Deep Psychology Wrapped Within It
","I've watched this film at least half a dozen times, I'd really love to watch the extended version to get more of the story. It took me several viewings to realize that Not many people would actually understand what this film is addressing and bringing to light. All wrapped within a visually graphic telling. Sure the characters and the initial plot captured my attention, but than as I watched it for a second and third time a few years after it's first release, I began to realize that this story is clearly outlining a very psychological depiction of one of the characters.... And no it's not the first female character to which we are introduced to upon the opening of the film. It is going through a very personal therapeutic process to which any 'average joe' off the street is simply Not going to see when watching this film, due to it's sexy elements and darker theatrics. True it is a story within a story within a story, but only a few viewers will actually understand that this film is depicting an intimate therapy session with someone who is MPD. Once I understood that, I re-watched the film and it again opened up a whole other learning and perspective for me, I no longer saw this film at such a flashy 'dolled up, awesome CG' gamer/nerd movie; like so many others do. I was seeing this film beyond what was merely entertainment value, and analyzing it from a much deeper perspective. And it has taken me watching it several more times to realize that this story is in fact very complex, and it is done in such a modernized way that it is masked beautifully to those who can not see it for more than it's superficial/plot twisted/darker story-line. Sucker Punch is an elaborately woven modern perspective that tells us, it's viewers, what it is like for someone with MPD who has been willing to go through an intense therapy session or sessions to begin the process of becoming an Individual, instead of allowing her multiple personalities rule her mind. It gives average people a small glimpse into the reality that MPD does exist and what it does to someone, that that someone has more than one single individual within their psyche due to absolutely horrific trauma. By the end of this film, it concludes that the person has finally joined all of her multiple personalities and has been successful and eliminating those persons within herself; ergo finally being able to be out in the real world and be free to lead a normal life as an Individual. True this story is darker and a great watch, but let me just say in my opinion, that once the deeper story-line comes to light for those watching it and they become more aware of what it is being said underneath the story within a story within a story, it makes watching Sucker Punch such an eye opening new story all together. MPD is something only a few have personal experience with, it is real, and not many can say for certain that they fully understand what it is and how it effects the people surrounding them. Sucker Punch is a very graphically charged, wildly wrapped up, modern Multiple Personality Disorder movie for us modern folks. If only it actually looked visually that way, not many will get what the film really is about. It's done very well and I enjoy watching and learning something new each time I view it for myself.",10,4,7,25 September 2016
Beauty and the Beast," I Yearned To Enjoy This
","Honestly I just finished watching this at home June 6, 2017 as it came out on DVD to rent and/or sell today ..... and I am left with the same feelings ..... it could have been so much better IF ( a big if and in my opinion ) the two main lead characters had been chosen more carefully and had actually wanted to lead the story. Please keep in mind I am a fan of the 1991 version as that is also my birth year, but disregarding that version and taking this film all on its own; I was still perplexed in not a good way by the end of watching this a second time through ( my first had been in the theater ). Even so Belle's (Watson) voice was so crazy auto tuned it literally nearly ruined my concentration and honestly I found the Beast character to be flat as well; both seemed to be truly aiming to help us ( the audience ) understand that they came to do a stage play..... not a film that much was felt by myself. The supporting actors ( the live talking house hold objects ), ( Gaston and his side kick ), ( the towns people ) >ALL< projected and emoted So much more convincingly than the two main leads in this 2017 remake of the 1991 classic. They >ALL< appeared and carried themselves and their voices as if they came to do their jobs above and beyond what's on the manuscript. I admit there are additional scenes in this live-action remake that add nice story filler and contribute to the bulk of the storyline that simply was missing from the 1991 animated version...... but that DID NOT Salvage this film on the whole from this epic train wreck. Truth be told IF I ignore these few and albeit startling obviously obnoxious glaring annoyances from the minute of the opening frame until the glitzy spaz of an ending...... I can admit it is somewhat a nostalgic feeling to see this live-action version but; IF Only ...... IF Only the lead two main leads had not been so utterly flat lined in how they delivered their individual performances and even together it seemed they had zero chemistry on each scene no matter the situation within the film. I can personally swallow all the flashy displays of costumes and over dressed up sets, the CG was passable and it seemed they did try to make it glamorous and enchanting which it was, but what wrecked the ballroom scene for me was how pitiful and flat and plain the Belle dress was!!!!! I mean really it was plain and I could assume budget cuts? That yellow dress on Belle is a statement piece of the character and yet I was left with my mouth hanging open in utter dismay and bewildered astonishment upon seeing it for a second time; I was grotesquely underwhelmed. {Trying desperately not to compare it to the 1991 version but BUT)....... The 1991 yellow dress on Belle was just that a gorgeous gown and the character wore NO jewelry or many accessories...... the dress was the main event and even on a animated character it SHOWED CLEARLY! This 2017 version of that yellow gown left me sad and unimpressed to say the least. Buttttttttttt ......... overall I wish Disney had tried much harder to put out a film worth watching ( and no I do not want a cookie cutter version of the 1991 version ) but I truly enjoyed Maleficent and Cinderella and Jungle Book ......... Why Oh Why is this Beauty & The Beast 2017 lacking? While remakes prior to it are seemingly more enjoyable and make clear that they attempted make it enjoyable for the audience no matter what changes were made etc etc the actors in those seemed to want to be there and absorb the character role and make it their own........ the two main leads in this did no such thing which only did more to reek havoc on the storyline rewrite.",5,1,2,6 June 2017
V for Vendetta," Isn't it interesting....
","I've seen this movie a dozen times or more since it came out back in 2005. Even as a teenager I saw in it what it was expressing, so I'd revisit the film from time to time for my own sake because there are some valuable things laced within it's screenplay. It was sorta silly and sloppily put together I agree with some reviews but the thing for myself, the more I rewatched it..... the less I critiqued the little stuff the less I looked at it as a goofy messy film in spite of all its historical role play or Shakespeare's lingo. The more I sat down and actually watched the film listened to the stories wrapped with stories within it..... the more I began to appreciate the entire film. The more I began to understand that this film has it all literally, it's not trying to be something it's not people. It's trying to help us as the audience. It has the corruption the intrigue the murder the lies the way the people just idly stand by because they the people KNOW who's fault it is that put them into this mess..... and you all think a typical answer *Oh well it's the big bad government that has the citizens the people locked up and stripped of their individual rights blah blah blah*...... Nope I'm sorry if that's all YOU see within this film than I guess it's intricacies will be lost on you. The more I watched this film the more I had this glorious feeling, sure it's got the scared heroine who gets freed from her own fears blah blah blah with the addition of the freedom fighter himself called V who is all mystic and bad ass. He carries the heart of the story while laced into the plots horrific past transgressions. This film has one single reverberating stamp on it that not many choose to acknowledge or see upon only watching it once..... took me a few tries before it struck me..... this movie is a giant 2x4 hit to the face to the people, as in US! It is one that pleads with us you *KNOW* who's 'FAULT' it is that Its people and citizens are in this predicament now. The people, the country's own citizens, they elected its government, they begged and cheered for its leadership to sit on the seat of power. The ONLY one to blame for those in the seat of government power and social structure is none other than the *'PEOPLE'* themselves. The film somewhat glosses over this Single but vital thought throughout it..... but it was not lost on me. They have it woven within the film so well that it is bound to be missed by those who are merely content to watch it at the surface and no further. It's a good film to revisit with all this government bs going on now in America. I could care less about Trump or Hilary what I am MORE concerned about is how passively desensitized to literally everything, all we care about is winning and making ourselves happily blissfully unaware and untroubled..... we can't be bothered to actually live life. All we care about is the latest technology how fast it goes, material wealth, money and personal gain. It makes me sick to see as THE PEOPLE of this country how far we have sunk. As a whole this is the truth. You know it and I know it.",10,7,12,14 December 2016
