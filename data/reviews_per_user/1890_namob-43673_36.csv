The Avengers," Fantastic entertainment, but week story
","When I rate movies (and yes, this review contain spoilers) I usually have 4 main criteria; Visuals, Acting, plot/story and Entertainment. Each with around 2,5p each equal 10p in total.The visuals and cinematic feel of this movie is very good. This is great entertainment and visually great. I give this a 2p The acting is top (mostly) and the chemistry between the characters is great. Also they give a good credence to the movie despite a week premise. I give the acting a 2.0pThe story/plot is where this movie fails. Too many plot holes and I cannot wrap my head around Loke's scheme, what the hell is his plan anyway? Why get captured? Why not just open the hole and surprise everyone? Would be a much better plan. I give this a 1.4pEntertainment-wise this is one of the best made in recent memory. There is always something going on,usually with a great sense of humor, and the movie feels very short because of it. A 2pIn total a strong 7 or a week 8. Despite above I rate the movie on a 7 mainly because it lack a lot comes to story/plot. This is very good entertainment and great fun, and the freshness of getting the Avangers together has an amazingly wow-factor, but at the end of the day not so much of a movie. As an action/superhero film this is great, as film in general pretty average.",7,0,2,24 April 2016
Sucker Punch," Snyders unsung masterpiece
","This is probably the most underrated movie of all time. If there ever was such a thing as critic-collectivism wherein everyone just follows everyone else, then this movie is evidence of that. Most reviews I've read I just shake my head at wondering if they even saw the movie.I even saw a few self-proclaimed 'feminists' complaining that this film is very shallow, violent, and degrading towards women, those folk definitely did not see this movie. If you watch this movie and think such things, and I am sorry if this sound pretentious, but if so you really need to start using your brain.This is a brilliant, very intellectual movie that deals with escapism, dream scenarios and it speaks a lot in metaphor. To me very similar to Donnie Darko, another movie I love. People watching and loving things like Transformers and Justice League might not enjoy this movie. I also understand that the tone of this movie within a deep metaphoric world will not appeal to all, but hot darn this is definitely for those of you loving psychology, deep thoughts, intelligent stories and escapism. Before Snyder ruined BvS, which is one of the worst movies ever made, and before he helped mess up Justice League, he did make the really good Watchmen and this unsung masterpiece. This is a movie that definitely belongs on a top 20 movies of all time list. A 9/10, and highly recommended.",10,7,14,4 December 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," One of the best
","I really loved this movie. And after watching it a second time, putting in 'a new hope' straight after was amazing. The movies ties in so well together they could almost have been done at the same time.Comes to the negatives I sort of agree with most of the criticism. The music was not the best and seldom enhanced the experience. A couple of the actors, most notably 'the Pilot' and the female lead could have done slightly better. I can also find a few specific moments that sort of work, but they feel like they could have been done better, the interrogation scene with some blob creature comes to mind... If being very nitpicky there are also a few, very minor, plot holes.So this is not a perfect movie, but it is almost perfect entertainment. This movie also delivers a more grown-up perspective of the rebellion and it feels like one of the best in the franchise. This is definitely a go-see film and I would rank this on pair with Civil War of the most entertaining movie of 2016, however I would still put this slightly ahead as a movie experience - growing up with the original Star War trilogy this is as good as it gets.As a final Spoiler! I would also like to point out that I find it extremely refreshing that they killed off all of the main characters. Seldom see that in movies and from a Disney own franchise seeing these adult themes and everyone dying a heroes death was a great choice, and kind of surprising. It totally make sense, and I assume all of them dying would be the case, but I was afraid they would shun away from it. The feeling from this movie also enhances the pay-off watching 'A new hope' because the joy and feel of pay back when they blow up the death star is, now, like seeing it for the first time again. Great stuff!",9,1,5,20 December 2016
Captain Marvel," Best Superhero movie ever made
","Let me first state that there are better movies. Even within the MCU, only looking at it as a movie (not a genre) Winter Soldier and the first Iron Man is probably slightly better. But within the genre of Superhero movies, this is the best I have ever seen. It is better than the Dark Knight trilogy, it is better than the first Superman, and it is far better than any other superhero movie not mention.Why?The first reason is that this movie put forward a unique superhero structure and it depicts a hero not afraid of her powers and hero that fully embraces her strength. I love the tortured hero all gritty fighting in dark alleys saving the damsel, those are usually my favourite heroes - and Captain Marvel is basically the complete opposite, which make her and this movie stand out so much, and I absolutely love it!The second reason is that she learn all the way. Step-by-step she understands who she is, why she is the way she is, how to use her power, and her background story. It is so earned and so cathartic that when she finally burst out fully super and seem unstoppable its such a powerful moment that few other heroes development can match it. She is so far away from being a Mary Sue and she is such a bright shining example of 'stand up and fight' that this is female empowerment at its strongest. And the movie does this without in-your-face feminist and without focusing on her womanhood, she is a hero, and she fights the bad guys, and she love doing it.
If you want to take your daughter to see a movie about female empowerment, this is the one she should see.The third reason is the re-watch-ability which is sky-high. I saw this movie 4 times at the theatre, more than any movie ever. I saw the first Jurassic Park and the first Matrix 3 times as an comparison. And I have seen captain Marvel probably 20 times since.The fourth is that for me the past couple of years have been filled with bad movies, and especially bad superhero movies. JL and BvS is the absolute bottom and horrible movies. But I also loath RagnarÃ¶k and I did not like Endgame at all. In the mist of all of these bad movies we have shining star in the night sky which is Captain Marvel. This movie saved the superhero genre for me, and I hope they follow this pattern and do more like this and the other two mention at the top, and stop making crap like Black Panther or that horrible Aquaman.Not that this movie is without its problems. The first 20min or so feel a bit too rushed and we get very little explanations and background stories for Hala, and the Kree and Cap Marvels eventual main antagonists. A couple of pop music choices were also not spot on, and the CGi is not always perfect.
Other than those small objections, this is as good as superhero movies get.The music score, not the pop music, but the actual score made for the film is one of the best ever made and it should earn a nomination for the Oscars. The costumes, the script, the acting, the action, the heroÂ´s journey, it is all brielliantly done.I would say as a movie this is a 8/10, but as a superhero movie this is a 10/10. Normally I would consequently put this around a 9/10 but to counteract the trolls and morons that see ghosts and make up stories, I will put a 10/10.
Amazing entertainment, amazing superhero movie, and I cannot wait for the dosens or so sequels. I highly recommend.",10,7,15,23 October 2019
Us," Worst movie of the year... so far
","Is this the worst movie I have seen at the theater? No... but not too far from it. I actually walked out. Yes, I got up from my seat about 1h and 15min into this movie because I could not stand it anymore and left the theater. First time ever. Never walked out of the theater before. I sat through the entire disaster of BvS, I agonizingly sat through both Solo and The Last Jedi, and I even survived sitting through RagnarÃ¶k and The Dark Tower. This movie however... no. I could not stand it.Again this is not the worst movie I have ever seen, it just so inapt, so dumb, so badly constructed I was in a perpetual state of cringe from the first minute until I had enough.The only entertaining part of the movie was Winston Duke making animal noises... again... And I am sorry, but I couldn't help myself from laughing, which I do not think was the intention. The first 10min or so is pretty good, acting okay-ish and from what I saw of the movie it is not ugly and have a decent music score. Those are the only 'good' things about this movie. There it ends.I am not going to give away the plot, mostly because I do not care about this movie at all, but also there is none. Yepp, a plot-less, boring, nonsense 'attempt' at some kind of 'scary humor' movie...
Just as 'Get Out' which was a better movie than this, but also not a good movie, it seem that Jordan Peele is trying to experiment with different styles, mixing them, throwing horror, thriller, drama, political satire, and weird attempts at humor into a blender and what comes out he pour into a water gun and randomly shoots at the audience.Scene after scene is happening, with no sense of direction, no sense of reason, lacking any form of relevance. The movie is not scary, not at all. The movie is not suspenseful, not at all. The movie is not funny, not even close to being funny. The dialogue is the cheesiest weirdo cringe I think I have ever seen... do anyone talk like this? There is nothing here, this movie offers absolutely nothing. Jordan Peele has completely failed with this miserable excuse of a movie. This is amateurish - did some random people from a hidden corner of youtube make this?And what is the point? What is the idea with this movie? Where is it going? Sure I did not see this dumb movie until the end, so perhaps something was explain, but reading other reviews I hardly think that is the case.I give this movie a 2/10... and honestly that feels generous.
The only reason I do not give it a 1 is because I never saw the movie until it ended, so perhaps something was explained, perhaps the ending saved something of the movie...
I cannot recommend this to anyone. Not 'Get Out' fans, although the weird all-over-the-place structure is sort of the same. Not to horror fans, not to anyone.This is absolute garbage and actually worse than Alita which I until seeing this thought was the worst movie of the year. At least Alita had some sense of directing and value, this nothing. Empty, boring nonsense.
Do not see this!",2,2,6,24 March 2019
Aquaman," Dumb B-movie but funny in an unintentional way
","After basically giving up on the DCEU, with only one half-competent movie so far (Wonder Woman) and four of the worst disaster I have ever seen, I have to say I am decently positive about Aquaman...Do not get me wrong, this is a really bad movie, and it has a lot of B-movie kind of feel to it. But, dare I say it? It is pretty fun! Not fun as in this is a good movie, because this is trash, but fun as in it tries so hard and it fails, and it has so many moments I burst into laughter over how inapt and dumb it is. The main 'bad' guy is so hilarious I can almost recommend this movie for him alone.There are soooooo many stupid moments, and that B-movie feel never washes away (pun intended), and we see some weird attempts to make political statements - and those facts together ruin the movie.
The basic plot is very generic and those comparing this movie to Black Panther would not be wrong, it is very similar, almost copy paste similar.I am being generous and give this movie a 2/10.Would I recommend this? Ouhm... not really. I mean if you get a bottle of Whiskey that you can empty and throw in the Ocean, like Aquaman like to do, and you watch this movie at the same time it might not be so bad.
This is the second best movie of the DCEU so far, after Wonder Woman. Imagine that, 2/10 and it is the second best movie of an entire franchise... how is that for a record? Yea, yea, plenty of weirdo people went out to see this movie mostly because they spend enormous amount of money on marketing in China, but also other strange folk. Why? What the... *beep*... made you think that this would be a good idea? Together with the Transformers movies Aqaman is the dumbest movie of all time that has made so much money.Super generic, B-movie, badly acted, bad CGi, horrible villains (but also funny!), flat story and script. Do not watch it, and if you do; load up with lots of alcohol because otherwise you cannot enjoy this.",2,0,1,22 December 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," Blackwashing, too many jokes, but very funny okayish movie
","Not sure what to say or think about this movie. It is hilariously fun, and the jokes are well woven into the narrative, the acting great, the action amazing. In almost every aspect this is the perfect action-y superhero movie, but I still do not like it... Out of all the Thor movies, this is probably my least favorite, and that is saying something. The reason? Well, the blackwashing for one. Again we see Hollywood destroy a great character only because they want to get rid of white people. It is racism, and that racist idea of exchanging white characters with black ones leave a bad taste in my mouth. Secondly there are way, way too many jokes in here. And worse: they joke when people are dying. Oh, a planet is destroyed and millions are dying? Well, let us joke about it. And laugh, and laugh... This is probably the blackest, darkest, most world changing movie (or topic of a movie) Marvel has done, but it ends up being slapstick comedy within a buddy road-trip. This movie feels like they've almost made a spoof move about something serious, and I do not like it at all. This movie should have been dark, gritty, serious, and the focus should have been on the blood, the dying, the ending of a world, but instead we get characters making jokes. This is not the movie I wanted and it is not a movie about Ragnarok. This is a comedy movie about friends going on an adventure. No... I do not like it... Also there are tons of topics just glanced over. Warriors three dying? Well, lets skip over that quickly shall we. Sif not in the movie? Nah, who cares. Loki was Odin the last time around, well let us joke about that and move on. I still give this movie a 5. It is very entertaining, it is funny, and the action is mostly fantastic. I can however not get over the fact that this movie should have been something completely different and in combination with bad taste jokes, and the racism, I cannot give it a higher score. Probably my least favorite Marvel movie so far and I hope that this movie does not spill over into other future Marvel movies, because this is how you kill a franchise...",1,9,28,30 October 2017
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Best Spiderman and a very good movie
","This version of spiderman finally got it right. Perfect spiderman movie and much better then any of the junk movies that came before. Everyone goes on about Spiderman 2, for me that was okayish, but not better. This however is a perfect 10 when it comes to nailing the character and the atmosphere of Spiderman, and it is a darn great movie as well! This is the funniest spiderman movie, it is the best spiderman movie, it is the most exciting spiderman movie and its the best incarnation of Spiderman ever. I cannot praise this movie enough. If you're taking your kids to see one movie this year, take them to this one. If you love spiderman in the comics you're going to love this! So why did I not give this movie a 10? Well, I almost did, but a few scenes brought me out of the movie and the whole 'I want to be an avenger' at the start of the movie gets a little bit too much. Also there is not that much action. I assume many Americans will give this movie a lower score because it is not 'fast paced' enough for them, but I can agree slightly. I would have been fun to see at least 1-2 more action scenes. As a superhero movie within the genre this is a week 10, which in my book make this top 3 best superhero movies of all time, perhaps even the best ever. I need to see the movie a couple of more times before I make a final judgment. As a movie this is decently solid 9 on the slight weak side. A bit too much of a few things and its not perfect and I can find a few nitpicks here and there. All in all though this is a brilliant and very funny movie that delivers excellent entertainment. I am going to see this movie at least 2 more times at the theater, and that is not something I do often.",9,3,8,7 July 2017
Shutter Island," Well acted, but extremely predictable. Scorsese´s worst, and very forgetable
","After getting asked why I had not seen this movie I decided to give it a try. Sadly it was not nearly as good as mention by friends, but still watchable and the acting really saves the movie.The first 5min of the movie reminded me a bit of the start of The Shining. Same hunting music, same feeling, and similar start heading to this weird place with weird people. But I also immidately starting to notice a few things and after 7min I had already figured the movie out, and with the first flashback I could almost recite the whole movie without having seen it yet.The movie is (mostly) well made, and the acting mostly superb. Sadly, and strangely, it is the directing that feels off - and since the story is very predictable, it lowers the movie quality considerably. The film also feels a little pretentious since it want to be a deep Oscars-winning-mystery-of-the-mind sort of a movie, but since the story is very easy to figure out and is not even close to original, and since the directing is not top notch (yea, I am still surprised) it does not work. The movie comes off more as a university student attempt to re-do Jacob´s Ladder.
I tried to twist the movie around in my own head, perhaps it really was true, perhaps they are trying to make him see things and think things because he really did see the truth, but nah, it did not work. IF that was the intention, I would be much more happy with the movie, but sadly I gave more thought to the movie than the movie makers did...
The movie is still worth a watch since the acting is so good, but my 5/10 is actually kind of generous. One of Scorsese´s worst, perhaps THE worst movie that genius has ever made.If you want to see a similar attempt to explore the human psyche, but much better made and also very original, then I would suggest that you look at Sucker Punch which is a masterpiece, this is not.",5,1,9,5 May 2019
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Used to be fantastic, now only okay because of Endgame
","Back in the day I would have regarded this as the best superhero movie ever made. A great entertaining piece of cinematic art. A fantastic mix of superheroism, action thriller, and spy movie.Sadly, after Endgame, the hero of this story has been reduced to an evil shadow of himself travelling back in time to do nothing but destroy the real life of poor Peggy.Adding to this we have the best superhero movie ever made coming out in March of 2019 which would have knocked this down a peg, but thanks to evil Steve we need to knock it down a few more steps.I used to have this movie at 9/10, but now I have to reduce it to 7/10. Please whatever you do, please stay away from the horrible Endgame and if so I highly recommend this great movie.",7,2,4,3 April 2016
Doctor Strange," Brilliant entertaining mind-trip but not perfect
","I was unsure whether to give the movie a 8 or a 9, eventually I gave it a 9 as a bonus for all the original fighting scenes and the mind-blowing trippy feast of a movie this is.I am also not certain how to rank this movie in comparison to other Marvel movies. I would say that Winter Soldier, Civil War and this one are the best Marvel movies so far, but I am not sure if this is the 2nd or 3rd best.At the end though this is more a great movie then it is a great Marvel movie. Sure it follows the Marvel concept and it is sometimes reminds you of the first Iron Man, but it is still its own thing, and very, very different from other Marvel movies. Hell, it is different from other movies in general.The acting superb, fantastic acting. Oscar worthy acting. And speaking of Oscars this movie should win one for visual effects. If Dr Strange does not win the Oscar for visual effects something is very wrong. It also has a great journey for the hero, it has a great story, fantastic action, and it is very funny. Almost everything about this movie is top, absolute top.But still, it does have flaws.Mainly I think the movie is too short. Dr Strange struggle to fix his hands is over in like 3min. I think they should have dragged that out for 30min or so to really hammer in his pain, his frustration and his willpower to fix himself. And due to all the trippy worlds that fly by at breathtaking speed (watch it in 3D!!) the movie is over so fast you hardly have time to sit down. Several of the characters, mainly the villain, have too short story arch's and it feels like we never really get to know them. Yes, it still works because the actors are amazing, but the movie could have been much better with 20min more run time.Secondly I do admit I am a bit tired of origin stories and so this, yet another one of those, is kind of tiresome. And yes, it works great here too, mainly due to amazing acting, but still; Origin. Again.My third complaint about this movie is that it feels incomplete. Perhaps that too can be related to the movie being too short, but what I mean is that it feels like it should have been more. I cannot really put my finger on it, but if someone said that this was the first episode of 3 I would not be surprised.And I almost deducted one point for not referencing the TV show AoS which is still the absolute best Marvel have done. Seriously; the best work they've done is not even acknowledged by Marvel lesser work, not cool. All in all though a great movie, perfect entertainment for the whole family. Do not, seriously, do not go into the theater drunk or high, you'll trip out completely and end up in a hospital.Very much recommended! Go see it, and see it in 3D.",9,3,7,3 November 2016
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Bad Star Wars movie, but not worst movie of the year
","To no surprise this movie is really bad. As a Star Wars movie this is a urine soaked turd, but to me not the worst movie of the year since I have seen a few that was worse.However I was not so disappointed. It was what I expected - This movie will be amazing to do a drinking game to later...So, what was good?Well, the music score is pretty good, the visuals (except for a couple of scenes) was excellent, and as with the previous two instalment in this trilogy; the acting is not the problem, actually looking at what they had to work with the acting is pretty good. These positive exceptions together with the fact that there are at least two movies this year I regard to be worse, it deserve a small bump up from the lowest score. If it was not for a few decisions made with this movie, it might almost be okay, and it is slightly better than The Last Jedi.The bad?Everything else. This is the final insult from Disney and Darth Kennedy, a final middle-finger to fans and movie-goers. Rey is the biggest Mary Sue of all time, and unless there is an image of her character next to every mention of that epithet from now on I would be very surprised. But as I mention before I do not think it is Daisy Ridley's fault, she did as good as she could.
The lore, the story, the feel, this world that used to be Star Wars is forever tainted and destroyed. I also have to say it all feels deliberate - I have a very hard time seeing Kennedy and the rest destroying this once bellowed franchise and not meaning it from the start. This was the plan from the beginning; to ruin Star Wars. I know that sound conspiratorial, but as said; what else could it be? You really need to try to get it this bad, you really need to put effort in it to so utterly ruin something.This is not as horrible as Midway or Endgame, both of which I regard to be the worst two movies of 2019, nor is it such a laughable insult as The Last Jedi was, but it is darn close.3/10 just because I am in a good mood and there are a few good things mention above. This trilogy has no soul and the insulting decisions made in all three instalments will hunt Disney forever. If you have seen the previous two and you liked them, perhaps you should check this out too, but otherwise this is a movie to not pay a single cent for.",3,22,38,19 December 2019
Captain America: The First Avenger," Now a worse movie because of Endgame
","This is a very nice story, and nice superhero movie with a lot of charm. It is entertaining, fun, and create a great background story for what used to be a virtuous good man and leader of the Avengers.Sadly, after Endgame, this is muddier and an almost completely ruined movie.I had this movie at a 8/10, but now I need to lower the score considerably, and I will stick with a 5/10.Why?Because in Endgame (spoilers) the previous good man and Erskine pick to get the superhero serum is now a shadow of his former self and commit one of the worst crimes ever seen in a superhero movie. Steve travels back in time to rip poor Peggy from her husband and pending children and then he stays in the past without helping anyone with anything - just a careless bystander to atrocities while time-raping the girl he claim to love.
Not the only completely ruin character courtesy of Endgame, but the worst and by far the most evil.I still like this movie, but I cannot watch it anymore because I only see evil Steve now. I can recommend this movie, but only if you never, ever watch Endgame.",5,0,1,17 November 2019
Baby Driver," Already a classic
","This is not a fantastic perfect movie, but damn it is entertaining and its fast and its fun. I have not had this much fun at the theater since I saw Deadpool. Baby Driver is a great movie from an entertainment perspective. Although the movie basically contains a lot of scenes and a plot we've all seen 10 times before, it still feels fresh, fun and original. I am uncertain about the last 10min and the end of the movie, and there are a few misses, and sometimes things goes too fast or have too many cuts, which coupled with the unoriginal originality drops the score somewhat. I believe this to be a strong 8.This is one of those movies you know, while watching it, that it will be a classic movie. 30- 40 years from now essays will be written about this movie, it will be quoted and referenced by critics. I am also 100% certain it will get a sequel, but please don't do it! This felt fresh and fun, I do not think a sequel will top or even come close to what this movie did.Most entertaining movie of the summer so far and yes, you should see this, and buckle up: the music score itself is worth the ticket price.",8,12,21,1 July 2017
Justice League," A bad movie, but almost okayish Superhero movie
","I had low expectations for this movie. The trailers did not do it for me, and seeing DC/WB track record I was very hesitant and worried. Seeing the movie last night my low expectations and worry came true. I really wanted to love this movie, but just as with BvS I got out of the theater feeling I had wasted my money and lost 2hrs of my life. This is better than BvS, but then again: what isn't? Not sure where to put this movie. It is, at times, sort of messy 'fun' as Suicide squad was, and it is not as dumb as BvS. JL tries to follow the Marvel formula a bit, throwing in a few one liners and the movie have a few fun moments, and although those funnies mostly work they also feel too forced in there. Personally I still think Man of Steel is the best movie from DC so far, too bad they messed up the start and ending of that movie, otherwise MoS would have been a great movie. Personally I did not like WW, although it had its moments. So where does this belong? Well, let us start with the negative: The CGi is actually really bad, just as bad as in Wonder Woman, or even worse. I see better CGi on TV nowadays, and I am not sure why DC and WB cannot do it better. Where did the money go? Affleck's salary? TVs Smallville had better effects, or look at Agents of Shield of today; they do great things with a fraction of the budget. The story is way too rushed. That apparent WB corporate directive of keeping the movie shorter then 2h seem to have done a lot of damage. Not that 30min more would make that big of a difference, but I will assume that a director's cut will be slightly better. This is especially sad for me since in the comics DC usually have great very well written stories. Here, not so much Probably due to being too rushed the movie has a pace issue. Either it moves too slow, or too fast. When you see the movie you'll probably understand what I mean. Cyborg does not work. Partly it is the bad CGi, but the actor is not very good in this role either. The villain does not work. Sure if you've read the comics you do, sort of, have an idea and know a bit of backstory, but in the movie none of that comes out – we are not clearly told who he is (except for some 'historical' exposition), we do not know what motivates him, why he is there. The little we do get to know is not enough for the general movie goer. The Villain is also very, very generic. Probably the most generic villain we've seen in any superhero movie. He shows up, with bad CGi, they fight for a bit, and well, you can guess the rest. One of the worst villains I've seen in a movie like this. A lot of critics have praised The Flash in this movie, personally I do not really see it. Sure he has a few fun moments, but it feels a bit forced and too much 'let's copy Marvel' funnies about it. There are a few major plot holes, and a few convoluted moments that ruins the experience and as a critic those moments are very hard to avoid. You can see them as plot devices (at best), OR: only forced upon badly written moments if you want to be more direct. I will update this part with detailed spoilers once I've seen the movie again. Positive: It is decently entertaining, at times... and it is not BvS bad. Wonder woman is pretty good in this movie, even better then in her own movie I would say, and the side-characters work very well. Aquaman is good. The acting okay and wellthat is pretty much it. Summery: Nothing fantastic nor great, JL is not a good movie. As a superhero movie this is okayish entertainment and Justice League is better than crap like Fan4stic or the horrible BvS, but is that really the comparison you want to make with a JL movie? As a Superhero movie I would give this a 3, but as a movie this is really bad and about a 1, so I ended up giving this a 2 in total. Not worth the ticket price unless you are very young. Or: if you do not mind seeing dumb story-lines and you just came to see some bad CGi action, then this may work.... For the normal movie-goer and for us looking for quality, this is not for us. If this had come out 20y ago, it would have been pretty great, nowadays we expect more, want more, deserve more, and with this talent and all the money spent they should have produced a lot better movie. A bad movie, but almost okayish Superhero movie.Edit: Saw it again yesterday (pirated - do not watch this at the cinema!! Do not waste your money!!) and I need to lower my score. Horrible movie and seeing it again, more focused, I see so much crap I do not know what to do. Worst movie of 2017, and that is saying something.",1,127,260,14 November 2017
Captain America: Civil War," Probably the greatest superhero movie so far
","The visuals and cinematic feel of this movie is amazing, although a few too many shaky cams so not top grades. The acting is absolutely amazing and the chemistry between the characters is great. Spiderman is fantastic and Elizabeth Olsen is great, and Robert Downey Jr. is one of the best actors alive today. Only the Vision that I am not so sure off, I was not sure after AoU and not sure now... I hope he is one of the characters that dies in Infinity wars.The story/plot is also very good. You will buy the premise and the stakes are very high. The setup at the end is just brilliant, and although this is a superhero movie, it has more in-common with Winter Soldier and spy thrillers then the Avengers.The villain is one of the best ever. His motivation, plot and execution of said plot is brilliant. A villain that actually succeeds and 'wins' in a superhero movie, how is that for a twist?Entertainment-wise this might be the best ever made. There is always something going on, usually with a great sense of humor, and the movie feels very short because of it. The airport fight scene alone is the best entertainment you will ever see, but personally I believe the last fight is the best of all time. Let me repeat; once you are over the fight at the airport and you go wow and think you will never see anything better, you do.... A perfect score! If you are in it for action and entertainment, you will love this movie!In total a 9 within the genre, perhaps an 8 otherwise. Personally I believe this, all things considered, to be the best superhero movie ever made.Captain America civil war is a must see and if you only have money for one movie this year, this is where you pay up. Great, great, wonderful movie - not just great and wonderful superhero movie.",9,7,14,29 April 2016
Avengers: Endgame," Good superhero movie with major flaws
","Endgame is filled with emotions, great scenes, beautiful cinematograhpy, and above all else; fantastic entertainment! This is what u would expect from a great superhero movie - so many great moments and wonderful send-offs to some characters.
Still I was not sold. I have a few nit-picks, but will ignore those for the big objections that brings the score down. But first the positives.This is the best most crowd pleasing Avengers movie yet, and as already mention; this movie is so beautiful to watch. The action fantastic! All the characters are great, but Iron Man, Black widow and cap america have absolutely stunning performances. Almost everything about this movie is top, top, top!Still, I will only give it a 2/10, which is actually generous. Let me tell you why.First, Thanos. Almost a full movie dedicated to this villain now and we know almost nothing about him. He wants to kill half the universe because... ???What drives him? Why collecting his 'children'? He is dangerous, strong, and the biggest foe, but who is he? I was hoping some would be explained, but no. They instead make him more comical evil in this movie, why?Time travel sucks. No matter how good explanations are or what u do with it, time travel creates paradoxes, lingering questions, plot holes, and in this movie it creates evil Steve..Speaking of; Captain America is evil! Yes, in this movie he rips poor peggy from her husband and children so Cap can get laid. Horrible ending of the movie!Fat lazy Thor, and another dumb usage of Hulk, Loki! And that stupid girl power pose... oh God that was so cringe. I loved Cap Marvel movie, but here she is a deus ex machina - how did she fly that ship millions of light years without Tony dying? 2sec? Really?The more I think of the movie the lower my score becomes. I started with 7/10 just after seeing it, now I have it at 5/10 and Im not seeing it again. Way too many plot holes and major flaws.Edit: Saw it online today, and it is really badly put together movie. Got even more disappointed, so I will lower the score again to 4/10. I cannot go lower though since I have Wonder Woman on the same score, and Endgame is not worse than WW so I will keep it there. So, so disappointed... how could the RussoÂ´s make such a bad movie? What happen?Edit2: After re-watching the fantastic Captain Marvel, which is one of if not the best superhero movie ever made, I decided to watch this trash again and I now believe Endgame to be one of the worst superhero movies ever made. It is not JL or BvS bad, but not far from it. Lowered the score to 2/10.
This movie suck, and anyone claiming this is a good movie is a moron.",2,10,18,27 April 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," McGuffin War is entertaining, but lack in script and explanation
","After telling people that I didn't really like this movie and, of course, getting attacked by every fanboy in the MCU I felt it necessary to put down a proper review.Let me start with the good so you know that I did not hate this movie. I actually enjoyed it. Infinity War is one of the most entertaining movies ever made. The entertainment value comes to fighting is great, a couple of superhero saves that are utterly amazing, acting very solid, music great, visuals mostly fantastic, and the villain is mostly great too.
If you look at infinity war as a prelude to the end of the first big story-line of the MCU and if you look at it from a pure entertainment point of view this is by no means a bad movie, it is, from that perspective, darn good.Above sound like I loved this movie, right? So why didn't I?Because this movie has a few very, very big flaws, and it introduces a few concept and a bunch of additional McGuffins in a very hamfisted way and I do not think it completely nailed the landing.Let me elaborate.Let's start with Iron Man. So Tony, suddenly, and completely out of the blue, introduces his new Nano-tech suit. Where did that come from? When was that developed? Why never mention before? This tech is so immensely impressive that Iron Man go from being a strong hero to almost invincible. If it wasn't for fighting Thanos with the Gauntlet, Iron Man would win almost any fight against almost any opponent now. Sure it looks pretty cool and the Russo brothers make the best of it in the movie, but... what!? It actually pissed me off. Marvel has been very good at building up these things over time, over full movies, but here the nano-tech is just thrown in there because it looks cool. That is the only reason it is there, to make the visuals and the fight look cooler.Next up we have Vision and Scarlet Witch that, apparently, and also very suddenly, a couple and are sharing a bed together in some hotel room in Scotland.
Now this was not completely out of the blue since it was sort of hinted at in both Civil War and Ultron, but them apparently sleeping together and being a couple in love!? What? I know they were/are a couple in the comics and if I remember correctly even have children together, so perhaps I should not be too surprised and upset over this development, but it makes no sense and it feels so rushed. In the context of the movie universe this is lazy writing, bad character development, and very forced upon us as viewers. Of course Captain America does a great save in a very nice entertaining way so I sort of forgot about this story hole upon first viewing, but it is not good writing. Not at all.Then we have Thor who, apparently, IS the God of Hammers. AND he gets an eye 25min into the movie, so that entire Ragnarök story in regards to Thor's character development is thrown out the window.
Sidetrack: I actually hate Ragnarök, I think it is, by far, the worst movie of the MCU. I think it is worse than Howard the Duck, worse than that awful Daredevil movie and worse then Elektra. Ragnarök is the only MCU movie in par with (some) DCEU movies, that is how putrefied it is. However the only redeeming trait of Ragnarök was the decent okayish character development of Thor that sort of work. But a few moments into Infinity War all of that is basically gone. He has an eye, and suddenly, after withstanding the blast of a star (haha..) he also have a new shiny ax. Then he summons the bifrost and with no knowledge about anything going on nor knowing where Wakanda is he poffs in there to save the day. That scene is absolutely fantastic, one of the best hero arrival ever and it is brilliantly entertaining, but it make no sense whatsoever. Again lazy writing or bad directing.I could go on pointing out so many other things like Red Skull showing up with no explanation, Gamora suddenly having half her planet alive (it was said before she was the last of her kind), StarLord flipping out (sort of understandable, but still...) and many other things in the movie that either demands background story or more explanation - stories and explanations we never get.What it all comes down to is either lazy writing or bad directing, probably a combo. The Russo´s have made very good movies before this. Civil War was very entertaining (and better than this movie) and Winter Soldier is as close to a masterpiece a superhero movie can get, but here they fail on several points. If it was just one character or one of the things I mention above (there are many more of these holes are missing pieces in the movie - take too long to list them all) it could be forgiven, but there are so many of them.
I keep getting the feeling that they wanted to make a super-entertaining movie and a part One out of Two to end this saga, and they did so with little consideration for good writing.
Why not an exposition dump? A narration or two? Why not ignore one of the fights and slow down and explain things? No! We need entertainment! Boff! Poff! Blam! Isn't this fun!?Now I come to my final, and most significant objection to this movie, and also most likely the most unpopular opinion of this review. The villain, Thanos, I wrote above that; 'the villain is mostly great too', but he is also completely weird and a really bad villain. Kill half the universe? Why?
Never explained other than in his; 'I am a green party member and I want to kill folk because we use too many resources' which is stupid beyond belief. How about double the number of planets? How about giving everyone a Star Trek replicator? How about clean energy? I hope his motivation is explained in Endgame, but if not he is just nuts, bonkers, crazy. In the comics his motivation was much, much more relevant and understandable, and that was crazy. And people complain that Captain Marvel is political? Really? This is the environment movement´s wet dream, nothing else.To summerize; this should be called McGuffin War because they fight over McGuffins with their own McGuffins and we get introduced to new McGuffins, out of nowhere, to counteract other McGuffins. And when Thanos finally collect all of his McGuffins he kills half the universe because we drive too many cars...
It is lazy writing, and bad storytelling. Sure it looks great, and all those explosions are nice, and oh boy all those McGuffins are fun and entertaining, but does that make a great movie? Is this really fantastic?No.To me this movie belongs in the mid- to low range of the MCU. There is a reason why Iron Man, Winter Soldier, and now also Captain Marvel, are the best movies of this franchise; because they are character driven stories. Sure those also have faults, and are perhaps not as entertaining as McGuffin War, but they are better movies because we get exposition, explanations, and we get to follow the characters in a logical well executed way. McGuffin war is just 2hrs and 30min of high-speed entertainment. It is almost like a Transformers movie, only better acted.And that is why I give this movie a 6/10.If Endgame do not explain some of the things I mention above I am most likely not going to like that movie either. BUT if it does, this movie probably need to be seen in a different light and I might need to up the score, but as of now it does not deserve a higher score.Edit: Since Endgame was horrible trash and explained absolutely nothing of McGuffin War it made also this movie worse. Endgame sucked so hard it was almost Justice League bad, and although McGuffin War was not as bad I have to reduce the score to 3/10. The Russo brothers should be banned from cinema for all time.",3,4,8,16 March 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," Great movie, great entertainment
","Infinity War was very predictable for us who read the comics, that is a small critic. Dinklage was out of place, Black Widow felt unnecessary, and Hulk was mistreated horribly. A lot of things was missing as well, and a few decisions did not really work. With that said though it was fantastic entertainment, great movie experience, and top 5 marvel movie. Also if you are a green party member and you want to kill humans because in your psychotic world there are too many people, you will love this movie beyond compare.One of the most entertaining movies ever made and a fantastic superhero movie, but as a movie (in general) it had too many problems to get top grade.",3,2,8,28 April 2018
Gone Girl," Wonderful, scary, great and so scary
","I actually stumbled across this movie through Honest Trailers, which I stopped half way through since it looked intriguing and then I went to watch, something I both regret and feel very happy for. Regret because I have dated this girl - not just one of them, several. Okay, none of my psychotic ex:es framed me for murder or rape, but the mindset, the intent, the malevolent way of thinking, that, that I have experienced. So to watch this movie wherein a women take that mindset to the edge is kind of scary, I kept thinking: that could be me. Very happy because this is a great movie. I cannot believe that this is the same Affleck that plays Batman like a tired old rocking chair. Rosamund is amazing, and so are all the supporting cast. Fantastic acting, great story, great directing. This is one of the better movies I have seen that also contain several weird plots and twists. The negative is that when Afflecks characters find out his wife is pregnant, he goes along with it. That felt a bit out of character and I disliked that he cave in, so the end of the movie did not fully work for me. Personally I hoped he would go postal or something, but on the other hand it could be a setup for a sequel? I was also, for some reason, annoyed by the cat. The freaking cat was everywhere, it felt like a plot devise that never happen and I fully expected something to happen with or to it, but it never did. My final complaint is that the police/FBI did not, or at least seemingly not, investigate properly. Come on! A murder that wasn't, a killed rapist by the supposed victim, weird turns, so many clues and an apparent setup and then suddenly the 'murdered' comes back having killed a guy!? Kind of suspicious times 10, but yea, it sort of made the story... Despite my complaints I give this a 9 out of 10, and I highly recommend.",9,0,0,30 November 2017
Get Out," That was boring...but also a few laughs
","This movie seem to have a lot of critics and others praising it, so having a boring weekend I decided to check it out.
And I soon learned that this movie is not suspenseful, it is not thrilling, and is about as scary as watching my towl dry up in the sun.So we have a black man as the lead actor, and the movie it sort of touched on some of the problems that, apparently, excist with interracial dating. The girl, who is white, and her family which is white, and their friends, also white, mumbles a lot of things about being white and voting for Obama (like that is a good thing) and how Tiger Woods is a great golfer... yawn... About here I was actually starting to think of golf, how to build a great golf course, how watching paint dry on said golf course...I saw a critic stating this movie is groundbreaking - yea... true, it is groundbreaking for insomniacs, the first half of this movie and they will fall down sleeping for sure.So before I head into the second half of this movie, which is sort of fun (but not in a good way) let me list a few good things about it. This movie is pretty well acted, the setting is nice and fitting, a few scenes are really well done, some humor lands pretty well, and although the 'mystery' of the story is easy to figure out after 15min, I was still a bit intrigued how they would pull it off. This movie is not horrible all the time. The first half, although kind of weird in tone and boring, is pretty okay. And the movie keep itself decently in its own world and as such its pretty well made.With that said; this movie is so boring. So, so boring. Not only because that 'mystery' of the movie is so transparent, but also because this movie do not know what it want to be. Is it a thriller? Scary movie? Social commentary? Love Story? Is it supposed to be funny? It feel all over the place. On IMDB it states 'Horror, Mystery, Thriller'... uhm... okay...
Sure it is not so common that a Black guy do not die first in a 'horror' movie, and that although he is sort of the token black guy, he is still the main driving point of the movie. Pretty much everything depends on what he does. But that also feels out of place. Not because he is black, but because he is made so out of place and written almost as the comedic relief rather then the main actor.In the second half of this movie we see it rolling out all of that boring stuff we already figured out, and it is actually very funny. Not intentionally funny. But when you have a black guy almost written like the comedic relief being the lead in a supposed 'thriller' with a plot we already figured out with tons of weirdo white people around, it get hilariously funny. The last 10-15min especially I was laughing out loud at how stupid everything is in this movie.I actually do think there is a good movie in here somewhere, and I can see the intent as positive, but the execution and the writing, especially the writing in the second half of the movie, is so poorly done.
How anyone can praise this movie is beyond me, but apparently a black lead and a black director is all that is needed to get celebrated.
This is really badly put together movie and although it have some good traits and I think this could have been good, it is one of the worst movies I have seen. The only redeeming trait of this movie is that it is unintentionally funny. This is the sort of movie you can do drinking games to, but is that the sort of movie you want to get praise for?I cannot recommend this to anyone. But if you watch this, get a lot of beers and everytime someone does something which is unintentionally funny; drink.",2,4,11,17 March 2019
Room," Wonderful, heartbreaking, beautiful, sad and happy movie
","Some Oscars are so well deserved they should be handed out twice. Brie Larsons performance in this movie is one of those times.
All the acting in this movie is amazing, but Brie is the stand out star for sure. The story sad but sort of happy-ish at the same time. The movie is heartbreaking, but also beautiful and wonderful.This movie is brilliantly done and I would probably rank it among the top 25-30 best movies of all time. With that said I am not sure this is for everyone. This is very emotional and it is about the acting. In other words if all you want is to be entertained by action and one-liners this is most likely not for you.I give it a 9/10. I would like to go higher, but the movie is not 10/10 perfect, I would say its 9.4/10 or so.A must see!",9,0,1,6 November 2019
Call Me by Your Name," Very good movie, fantastic love story, but also boring.
","After only seeing one good movie during 2019 (Captain Marvel) and having nothing to do I started to check Oscars winners and I stumbled across this gem which I strangely ended up really liking. This is a very good movie!I thought this would be one of the worst movies I would ever see - it is a love story about gayness, Oscars winner, so of course this will be pretentious crap and political correctness stupidity right? Some Jewish family in Italy get a visit from a older gay guy that seduce the young 'boy', so of course this is some pro pedo movie only loved by Joe Biden and James Gunn, right?
So wrong, I was so wrong. What I thought would be a bad movie I would laugh at and give a bad grade, ended up surprising me like few other movies have. I could not be happier of being so wrong. Well, perhaps 'happy' is not the right word, because this is also heartbreaking on several levels.Let me start with the bad of this movie.The music is atrocious. It sort of fits, mostly, but it is not good, and sometimes even awful.
A few scenes drag out a little too much - the movie is pretty long for this type of movie, and it get a bit boring, especially during the (sort of) 2nd act. This movie do not really have act´s, which fits the story, but it lacks that normal flow we as movie goers are used to, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but I think they drag it out too much. This could easily have been cut down 15-20 min, and the movie would have been better for it.
And for those of you looking for a LGBT movie with lots of political correctness to love (or hate) you will be disappointed. This is a love story, and it does not matter what gender they have or who they are, the story is what matters, and although everyone do a great job acting out that story it is the story, the very, very well written story that is the gem here.
Which means this is not a political statement, this is not promoting gayness or anything of the sort, which probably will disappoint a few, but for me this was so refreshing so it is a positive.
And finally there are a few moments, especially in the long dragged out parts, that I think the directing could have been better. Don´t get me wrong, I think the director did a great job with this movie, but a few more cuts, and a few scenes that could have been shot better - since the script is so amazingly good, those directorial misses stand out.The god is literary everything else. I already mention the story, but it cannot be stressed enough. This has to be one of the best screenplays ever written - apparently based on a book that I have never read. The setting of the movie great, the acting amazing, almost everything in this movie breathes and show emotion in a way few movies do. The love story is brilliant, absolutely brilliant. Few movies have captured my heart as much as this movie did, and the movie is about two Jewish men in Italy doing gay stuff, how did that happen? Why do I like this movie so much? Not sure, but as mentioned before, the script and the love story is fantastic and cannot be praised enough.I give this movie a 8/10. A strong 8. The reason why I do not go higher is because the movie drag too much, and the music bugged the hell out of me. This is such a great movie, but if the director had fixed a few scenes, cut perhaps 15 min or run-time and got better music to enhance the feeling of the film; then this could very well have been one of the best movies of all time. It really is that good.I do think you should either see this movie alone or as a couple. As a straight middle-age man thinking I´d see a politically correct gayness bonanza, I was crying and living this movie. But this love story man, oh man... If you have a partner or a girlfriend or whatnot, this will likely also be for you. If you are a bunch of friends looking for a nice entertaining movie; well, this might not be for you.With those impasses, I highly recommend this movie. Surprisingly great!",8,1,5,30 March 2019
Transformers," Great entertainment, but that is pretty much it.
","This, the first transformers movie, is a very good movie if you are looking for entertainment and action. I really enjoyed this movie and unless you start to think too much, so you will you. Yes, there are a few plot holes, especially around Megatron, and this is not for an Oscar or for those who want a deep dialogue. This is for entertainment, and if you accept that it is very good. I will not review other transformer movies, because most of those are horrible, but I like this one. A few critics complain about Megan Fox, I do not, I think she and the rest are what they need to be; entertainment! One of the most entertaining movies of all time, but as a movie and if you look at what is actually going on, well then the score drops considerably. Entertainment-wise is a 9, as a movie a 4, so I put this on an 7. The following movies drop lower and few are pure crap, but this is very good and feels decently well connected to the original comic. If you do not like being entertained without any substance, this is probably not for you, for the rest; this is a must see.",7,0,0,15 April 2016
Mulholland Drive," Best movie ever made
","I have only handed out two 10s in my entire life, this is one of those.According to me, this is the best movie ever made. The story completely bewildering and amazing, some of the best acting ever seen, the directing and editing superb. This is as close to perfection a movie can ever come.I have watched this movie so many times, and every time I am amazed with all emotions, strangeness and bewildering music. This movie sucks you in, messes with your head, throws you in a blender and then spits you out dazed as if you've been hitting the bong. There are tons of good reviews of this movie so I will not bother with writing a long text, other then again state: Best movie ever made!",10,3,4,22 October 2016
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Good movie, bad Star Wars movie
","This movie is very hard to rate. It is pretty cool, have several of great scenes, the cinematic is great, the directing great, the acting great, BUT the movie still sucks. I will not do any spoilers so you need to find out what I mean for yourself, but as my headline reads: this is a decent/okay/good movie, BUT it is a crappy Star Wars movie. In general the twists and left turns do not work. The main reason they do not work is because the movie is just okay. If the movie had been fantastic, the twists would probably not bother me as much. 
I am very 50/50 on this movie, so the closest to objective grade I can give this is a 4/10. The fan in me want to hand out a 1/10, the movie critic is closer to 7/10, so I did sort of a middle ground and gave it a 4 out of 10.I probably need to see it again to give it justice as far as critique goes, but I am not going to pay any money for this ever again. From that you can probably draw the conclusion you need.",1,10,18,15 December 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy," A fun take on uninteresting characters
","When I rate movies (and yes, this review contain spoilers) I usually have 4 main criteria; Visuals, Acting, plot/story and Entertainment. Each with around 2,5p each equal 10p in total.The visuals and cinematic feel of this movie is pretty good. It is the first Marvel movie set in space and generally the movie looks great, but perhaps slightly disappointing since we have seen just as good or better space depictions in movies 10y older.I give it a 1.8p. The acting is for the most part good and except for Ronan the Accuser, which has more to do with me disliking how they handled the character in general rather then the acting. I give this a 1.9p. The story and the plots of the movie is very good (except for Ronans'motivations) and it ties in nicely with other Marvel movies. Nothing amazing, it is the entertainment, the freshness and the acting that drives the movie, not really the actual story. I give this 1.5p. Entertainment-wise this is one of the best made in recent memory. There is always something going on,usually with a great sense of humor, and the movie feels very short because of it. A 2.3p. In total a strong 7 or a week 8. I would rate this the third best Marvel movie so far behind Winter Soldier and the first Iron Man. My objections with this movie is partly that it almost feels like they did not put enough money into it. There has been a few movies set in space which are just as nice or better looking, and most of those are 10, 15 or even 20y old by now. It does not make the movie feel cheap, it is just that you never feel like the heroes are in the wonderful vastness of space. Secondly the character of Ronan the Accuser, which is horrible mishandled. Ronan is one of my favorite characters from the comics and one of the reasons for that is that he is always logical, intelligent and (too) rational while loving his people and loving the empire. In this movie he is almost a parody of himself, only thinking revenge and too single minded. Also he dies (?), which is crappy in itself. The Kree is handled much better in the TV-show, which by the way they should have referred to along the way. This is very good entertainment, great fun, and a fresh movie with a fun take on, what I believe to be, pretty uninteresting characters. Never cared about them in the comics, but here they come to life in a great way. A few issues here and there and a bad Ronan together with Howard the F***ing duck brings the score down and I am generous with an 8, perhaps it should be a 7...",8,0,3,24 April 2016
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Entertaining and fun, but could be better
","Age of Ultron is an average movie, however it is very entertaining and fun. I hold Captain America winter soldier as the best Marvel movie this far and Age of Ultron is a fair bit behind, but I see it as a necessity for future movies - the movie is sort of setting up the pieces for the future and seen from the perspective the score should perhaps be higher.Age of Ultron should probably be seen after you watched Agents of Shield episode 19, season 2, especially for the nerdy types like myself that love the Marvel universe as a whole. The TV-show is however better then this movie so if you want a choice, watch AoS instead of this. The problem with this movie as I see it is that I never really see the Avangers in any real danger. From the start to the end I almost knew what would happen and I feel like they underplayed both the twins and Hulk. Especially the twins and their background are just skipped over, hopefully the Scarlet Witch will get a lot more screen time in the future. Also the acting is lacking slightly and the plot is week. A good entertaining movie and well worth the ticket price and you should see it, for nothing else then to be in the loop for the franchise, but it does not have the wow-factor.",5,5,12,3 May 2015
Midsommar," Good movie! But no, not really... this only partly goes on in Sweden.
","First the question on everyoneÂ´s mind; Yes, this is to a large degree Swedish tradition. Of course it always rain on Midsommar, we drink a lot more, and we have a lot more sex, otherwise... well, we only sacrifice people in some areas of the country, otherwise goats, horses and such...With that lie (or was it?) out of the way, this movie is pretty good. It is absolutely gorgeous to look at, the acting amazing (Florence Pugh should win an Oscar for this!), the directing, light, costumes, pretty much everything cinematographic is great. I also love the subtle nuances like the upside down sign during the car drive (learn Swedish and read...) which is a pro-'racist' sign, or in the context of the movie I assume a subtle hint that immigration is good and those who oppose it are cultist nuts sacrificing people left to right...I would argue there are 3 main treads in this movie and depending on which one you pull and focus on, I believe it will impact what you think of the movie.The first thread is the psychological trauma, abandonment and family tragedy, and this is absolute spot on. Fantastic! It is mainly due to the absolute stunning performance of Florence, but the movie portrait it amazingly well and if this is your focus or what matters, then this movie is a 10/10.The second thread, that partly goes to together with the first, is the focus on break-up and a sort of toxic relationship. This too is made really well, but not as well and I think a few things does not work. If this is your focus and what you take away from the movie its a 8/10.The third and most important thread of the movie, and my main objection to it, is that the cult, their ideas, why, how, and such is not fully explained.
I guess it does not have to be, but since HÃ¥rga is a well-known little village in Sweden connected to the Devil (check out HÃ¥rgalÃ¥ten on youtube) it get a bit confusing. Is this a Devil-worshipping thing? Viking? Pagan in general?
Despite my little joke above, and despite midsommarblot (sacrifice) and Ã„ttestupa (the old people jumping from the cliff) actually did happen historically (yes, those parts are actually true), I cannot see any 'realism' in the context of this movie. Again I guess it does not have to be... but as a Swede kinda confusing, perhaps more so for me than anyone non-Swede.
From my perspective this main thread is more a 5/10 in this movie.Another negative is that it is very confusing that the outsiders do not immediately leave after the jumping-to-the-death-thing. I do get that they were drugged and such, and the movie sort of tells us this, but still... that did not sit right. Should have been something before or after explaining their motivation to stay.The movie also get a bit dragged out and boring. Sure I get that the director want to build suspense and create an weird scary atmosphere, but it goes on for a little too long.Since nothing of the cult was fully explained and we do not get a full explanation of the ending, I also felt a bit cheated. Of course we can fill in the blanks to a large degree and if you check out a lot of the symbolism you can sort of figure it out, but not... really... I dunno, it felt too abrupt and a bit convoluted.And finally this movie is not really scary, it felt more like a weird attempt to thrash Swedish heritage rather than a horror movie (if focused on the cult and third thread).
The other objections I have I can partly swallow, but overall I did not buy the premise of the cult-part of the movie. Yes, I know it is a scary horror cultist movie and it is not fully meant to make sense from that perspective, but something about the wholeness of the movie do not sell it to me because if this. If the movie had focused on and been only about the trauma and psychological impact and Florence acting, this might have been the best movie of all time - not a joke, she and that part of the movie is beyond amazing.Still I like this movie, it is beautiful to watch and it has several great traits, and if Florence do no win an Oscars we should all riot.
However for reasons mention I was not sold, I did not love it or take so much away from it.In the end I give this movie a 7/10. Worth to check out and I sort of recommend it, but not a favourite and it is not for everyone. Or said in Swedish this is a: Hyfsad MedelmÃ¥ttig film.",7,0,1,22 October 2019
The Witch," Great acting and interesting story saves the movie
","I do not really like this movie that much. It is a bit too boring, extremely slow paced, and a bit confusing at times.However the acting is phenomenal, from the Goat to the kids, and if Anya Taylor-Joy is not a shining star a couple of years from now I am going to eat my laptop. The story is also very compelling. Yes, it is not perfectly told, as it is also confusing, but very interesting nevertheless. The movie is feeding us psychological horror and it works thanks to an amazing cast. The ending is also top. I love it when evil 'wins', and I also believe it open up the possibility for sequels. I think they should do a follow up to this, Anya Taylor-Joy can play a fully grown adult witch that uses her body, mind and spells to gain immortality and watch the Salem trials from afar while chewing on a baby...",9,0,4,2 August 2018
Joker," On Second viewing this movie suck
","If you read through the reviews it is mainly two fractions arguing.
Fraction one claim Joaquin is fantastic, this movie is the best thing since sliced bread, and the only question is how many Oscars it should win.
Fraction two argues that this is basically a copy paste movie and it stands on two (or three) previous gigants and the director is a lazy hack.I agree with almost all of that, both sides. Joaquin is great, and the movie is decently made, but it is also stolen and copy pasted and on a second viewing the movie get very boring, and most of it make little to no sense anymore.
On second viewing focusing on details you notice a lot of mistakes and a lot of the dialogue which is surprisingly bad.And Oscars? Please! I think many in the committee think as many others do and personally I do not think they should reward copy paste movies with almost zero originality with trophies.The main issue I have with this movie is, seemingly opposite almost everyone else, is that I feel it is too short. They never fully develop all the side characters, the Joker is almost the only focus, which sort of work due to great acting, but if you are going to really 100% care about the protagonist he/she also need to face up against something, and the surrounding need to matter. This movie develops and show Joker, that it is. This is a one-man show and a psychological downward spiral, which is fine, but not something to build an entire movie on.Anyone claiming this is a masterpiece have never seen a movie before. Or they are lying to you.This is not as bad as Alita or as horrible as Us, I would put this on par with that awful Endgame movie. 2/10.",2,8,17,11 October 2019
Wonder Woman," Okayish, but moving too fast with bad CGI
","So, okay, this is a better movie then Suicide Squad (duh!) and it is an enormous leap forward from the absolute horrific stupidity of BvS, but is WonderWoman really a good movie? Well, nah, not really. It is decently entertaining and it does have several redeeming traits, but sadly not a very good movie. Let us start with the bad. The CGI is horribly bad. It is so obvious and so badly done I keep wondering if this movie was made in the early 1990's. I saw this movie the day after seeing Agents of Shield season finale, and AoS had 10-times better CGI. Did they not get money to do a WW movie? The story moves way, way too fast, throughout the movie. They jump from this to this and there is no time to breath, catch up with characters or develop any sense of location. It feels like this movie should have been 2 hours longer and I can only assume it was cut down to fit the American public that love fast pace action set pieces. Diana is a kid, swhoosh, Diana is training, swoosh, Germans are evil and let this Jewish woman go kill them for some reason. Then they jump on a boat and faster than The Flash they are in London, and then swoosh they are in the war, then dancing and then off fighting and whopidoda the movie is over. I got the feeling I was fast forwarding 10-15min all the time. Did they cut out 2 hours? Was the script this bad? The villains were pretty boring and badly flushed out. People keep complaining about Marvel villains, but this was far worse and in a fast pace movie like this you really do need to feel the strength and power and immense danger of the villain(s), but in this movie you do not. Not at all.I also need to mention that I hate that the 'hero' is fighting the poor Germans in WW1, of course the central powers and Germans were the good guys in WW1 (as far as such things goes in a world war), but the propaganda must go onThe good? Well, Gal Gadot is good as WW, most of the supporting characters are good as well. Most of the action, if you can ignore the bad CGI, is good. The general story, if ignoring all the plot holes, is compelling and there are a lot of fun and great moments in this movie. There is a good/great movie here somewhere, but it is cut away and hidden under badness. If you can relax and just enjoy the ride and not let the bad elements mention above take you too much out of the movie this is okayish. I give the movie a 4 out of 10. It is entertaining after all, but not as good as Man of Steel which is still (to me) the best of the DC movies and also, strangely enough, the DC movie with least Christ-imagery Are all DC characters supposed to be God? Or Gods? Is that the point? Boring. Edit: Just saw the movie again last night and having time to focus on the movie and how good/bad it is, I detected a lot of other issues, inconsistencies and weirdo plot holes I missed the first time around. Consequently I will lower my score to a 3 out of 10.",3,276,509,6 June 2017
Black Panther," Most overrated MCU movie and extremely generic
","I managed to see this movie again during the weekend, preparing for Captain Marvel, and I felt I had to do a review on this movie. Especially since Cap was such a great movie in comparison.Black Panther is not only the most overrated MCU movie so far, I would go so far as to say it is one of the most overrated movies of all time.
It is not horrible bad per se, it is just so darn boring.
The reason it is so boring is partly because it is super generic - bad guy wants heroÂ´s stuff/title, bad guy fights good guy and 'wins', good guy comes back reinforced/trained/equipped or with allies and wins in the end. That is it. That is the movie. Which would be fine-ish if the movie had something else to offer, but except for clothing and music, it does not.
The second reason this movie is so boring is because there is no excitment - the movie is so predictable that after 10min I could tell you exactly what would happen. Well, I did not know that the villain, who is the most Hitleresque character I have seen in a movie, had ancestors jumping into the sea dying because they wanted to be free. He was Wakandan, no slaves there.. so what was he talking about?But yes, lets talk villains. Claw was great for the time he was in the movie, and the Rhino dude had decent motivation so okay I will buy that. But the main villain of the story want to spread weapons, conquer, and save people that 'look like him'. All in a nationalistic very neo-fascist fashion. Almost all of his speaches mimic Hitler, if you do not believe me, check out a clip of Hitler and compare. Uncanny likeness. And this is a villain so many can relate to? Weird.Something else that stod out was the bad CGi, what happen Marvel? Why suddenly so bad computer graphics? The two CGi suits fighting in the end took me so far out of the movie that I starting to think of what to eat for lunch the day after.And finally this is the most political Marvel movie to date. In some aspects I both expected it and can think it is necessary - it is very hard to talk Africa in this context and not mention slavery. HOWEVER, In the MCU, Wakanda is located just north of Lake Turkana, at a point bordering Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda, and South Sudan. Do you know who took slaves there historically? It was not white men, nor christians... so... why was that not mention?
And the wall thingie at the end, was that really necessary? Felt out of place, out of character, and too much on the nose.I give this a 3/10, and I think Black Panther is the second or third worst Marvel movie so far. As part of that universe it should perhaps not be overlooked by fans, but otherwise I cannot recommend this at all. So, so boring movie. Even The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, all of the Thor movies, hell even Justice League, was more fun then this. Not bad, just bland, boring, predictable, extremely generic, and did I mention boring?",3,5,8,7 March 2019
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Setting a record in plot holes
","When I rate movies (and yes, this review contain spoilers) I usually have 4 main criteria. Entertainment, visuals, acting, and plot/story. Each with around 2,5p each equal 10p in total. The visuals/cinematic feel of the movie were good. Not great, but good, so I give that 1,3p. The acting was actually the only really good thing about this movie. Considering what they had to work with and how badly the movie is put together the acting is actually very good, so I give that 2p. The plot(s)/story of the movie however is so bad and so crappy I should actually put in a lot of swear words here. It's a 0. This is, by far, the big budget movie with the most plot holes I have ever seen. Every single scene has at least 1 plot hole. Jimmy Olsen CIA agent? Really? Lois Lane throwing that sphere in 8ft of water. Lex JR effortlessly gaining access to an alien spaceship which gladly tells him how to build a doomsday weapon? Deus ex Martha!?!? I could go on forever. 0!!Entertainment-wise I was bored most of the movie and with so many plot holes I could not enjoy it without going cinemasins 'ding' in my head every 5sec. Sure a lot of good action sequences and if they hadn't ruined WW appearance through trailers that would have been epic, but in general not very entertaining. Drones and kids aged 11y and below might see more entertainment in this then I did, but I need to care more about the characters and since the movie in general was so bad, I could not enjoy what could have been great action and great scenes. I still give it 0.2p, mostly due to Batmans awesome saving-Martha-rampage and WW.So 3/10 is my score which actually feels too high... so I deleted 1p due to the bad management of and horrible writing for Superman. They missed the essence of Superman, in MofSteel also, but in this movie especially. My final score is a 2.Edit: I just saw the movie again, mostly for the laugh of it and I cannot believe how bad this movie is. This is so bad we need to invent new words for it. Horrible, terrible and lots, lots, lots and lots of profanity. I change my rating to a 1, this movie deserve nothing and should be banned forever. Brrr... and uha... so, so bad...I believe that cinematic education and film studios should show this movie to people in the industry on how to not script and not edit a movie, and the director of this movie should never be allowed near anything cultural ever again. Classic example of a messy film which, for the most part, make no sense.ï»¿ Worst movie of 2016 so far and watching this crap only pisses me off.",1,44,81,2 April 2016
Midway," Horrible war propaganda from the victorious evil
","This crap tell the story how a evil empire jumped into a conflict they should never have been apart of and this 'movie' show how they won a battle against another evil empire. AND as we clearly are told initially and after the 'movie' this film is sponsored by a third even more evil empire. Propaganda through and through.And apparently they won by using CGI planes flying about like gravity-defying space ships, and by using atrocious dialogue to bore the enemy to death.This is actually worse than Endgame, and worse than Us. I think it is the worst crap I have seen this year.If you go and watch this movie, I suggest bring vodka and every time you see badly done CGI or you hear bad dialogue you drink... you will be passed out after 20min...",1,19,51,15 November 2019
Kingsman: The Secret Service," worst of the worst
","This is one of those movies that baffles me. Well, not the movie itself, it is so bad and so horrific it should go down as one of the worst movies of all time. No, what baffles me is that some people like this movie. Why? This is bad on a whole new level. I can only conclude that somehow this movie and the people voting on it arrived from another dimension where George W Jr is earthly dictator and Soft-Boiled Fetal Duck is everyone's favorite food.If there is one movie you should stay away from it is this one. And I do not mean that in a funny way. You cannot do drinking games or something to this movie, this is crappyness on another level.Worst. Movie. Of. All. Time.",1,4,11,13 October 2016
