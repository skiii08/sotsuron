It," Good, but not great.
","I am a huge fan of the book, and wasn't disappointed by the TV adaption, and walked into the cinema really looking forward to this new 'IT'eration. I walked out feeling a little bit like I did after watching the Lord of the Rings/The Hobbit series of films. The basic storyline was there, as were many of the events that occurred in the novel, but like the Tolkien adaptions there were too many jarring omissions, additions, other assorted departures from the book for my liking. There were also a tremendous number of continuity errors, mostly concerning characters falling into/being doused with various liquids in one scene, then in the next (during which essentially zero time has passed) being completely dry. The acting was very good - all the characters did a good job in their roles, Bill Skarsg√•rd is a worthy successor to Tim Curry, and was a pleasingly revolting Pennywise, the child actors continued the course set by Stranger things, and were neither annoying, or whiney most of the time, as children in films often are. For a 135 minute film it zoomed by, normally I consider this to be a good thing for a film of this length, as it means I have enjoyed the film, and/or the content has been paced correctly. In this instance, however, it felt rushed, very rushed, as mentioned above, a large amount of content has been omitted from the book - the individual characters stories were heavily truncated. I get the feeling that this film was very much released as a stand alone film, and had it failed at the box office, there would be no part 2 (thankfully this has been averted), and am expecting, a year or so after the second film there to be (like LotR) a very much extended version released, because there is so much that could have been added to the film without making the film seem too long. Anyway, again, to conclude, in its current form, 'IT' is a good film, but not a great one. An improvement on the TV adaption primarily in special effects, and little else.",7,1,2,2 October 2017
The Thing," As good as a sci-fi chiller gets
","I first watched this film about 10 years ago, after having seen the original 1950's B&W version and then being told by my dad this one was better. How right he was. From the very first scene, of the dog being chased and shot at by the Norwegian helicopter, everything is highly strung tension. The music helps to add to the atmosphere, as does the horrible isolation of the Antarctic (although not shot there) landscape. All of the actors - Kurt Russell especially - play their parts extremely well and the feeling of comradeship being torn apart by horror and suspicion just draws you further into the story (adapted from the short story 'who goes there?' by John W Campbell. There is a prequel being made at the moment, detailing the events up to and including the Norwegians chasing the dog scheduled for 2011. I really hope this upcoming film contains some of the magic of the original.",10,0,1,8 December 2010
Twilight," Avoid at all costs...
","To say this review 'contains spoilers' is to imply the viewing experience will be ruined, or at least in some way damaged by reading them. This film has already been 'spoiled' There are few redeeming features - the scenery and the reasonably pleasant looking Kristen Stewart being the only 2 I can think of. The film opens with a pale girl (Stewart) moving from Arizona (and her mother) to Washington State (and her dad) - no hard feelings on either side though. She meets some random Native Americans and then goes to school where she immediately is befriended by an unbelievable multi-ethnic group. Also a mysterious family of incestuous 'foster' kids, who seem to be the only paler beings than Bella (Stewart) in existence. They also all look to be in their mid-20's despite supposedly being 17. Brooding amongst this group is Robert Patterson - who is her 'leading man'. This is where the film ended for me - the interaction between the two of them was so static and unbelievable - it bypassed normal teen awkwardness and descended into slow motion shots and.....so....many.....pauses, seriously this film would be half an hour shorter if they had a conversation like normal teenagers. After being saved from an out of control car by Patterson our two star-crossed lovers start hanging out and she guesses he is a vampire - but a nice one who doesn't feed on humans any more. A small part of me died then. RP wants to show her then what he looks like in the sunlight (these vampires are fine wandering about in the daylight, but avoid sunlight at all costs). A part of me wanted him to explode into dust so the film would end, but sadly it didn't. Instead we saw, not a burning vampire, not a revealed monstrosity drooling blood. No. He was sparkly. That's right, he sparkled. Gold. Like an underground 80's pop star covered in glitter. I didn't pay much attention after this happened, I only kept the telly on as background noise - there was a 'humerous' scene where KS went round RPs house and the rest of his 'family' (incuding the local doctor) used the kitchen 'for the first time' to cook her some food. There was a baseball game with vamp powers and KS got stalked by some random 'evil' vampire. Ends with him biting her RP and the family destroy him and RP sucks out the vampire 'poison' just saving her from turning into a vamp herself, before RP and KS head off to the prom - as you do. This was over 2hrs of wasted life - it makes Buffy look like Oscar winning acting and I am amazed it was ever green lighted for filming. A true golden turd winner, knocking even the derisable APEX from it's lowly perch.",1,8,10,17 August 2011
