"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Exceptional!!
","A definite 'Must see' film even if you have never watched another film with Simon Pegg or any of his TV appearances such like 'Spaced'.With clever script writing and a top cast i have to say that this film will keep you glued to your sofa for the duration of the film. Sometimes when you see a trailer of a film that interests you you find out that when you see the film you know that the whole trailer is full of just the good bits of the film (Which is disappointing as that means there is about 60 seconds of just good bits in the entire film) but with 'Run Fat Boy Run' this is not the case. From the start of the film to the very last second the word 'Entertaining' does not cut it, Exceedingly funny, Very very humorous and Rib crackingly comic may just give you some sort of idea how good this film is!! Stock up on your popcorn and any other goodies you want, sit back and relax and enjoy the flick!!",10,1,4,27 June 2008
