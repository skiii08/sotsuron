Antz," A beautiful film in its own way
","'Antz' is one of those movies that perhaps won't stick with us forever, but is still memorable and thought-provoking. Despite how it was promoted, this is not a children's movie. First of all, the swearing is a little too much for a child, and there are some pretty graphic sequences. Secondly, though this is nothing against the movie, the themes are too deep for a child to truly comprehend. A better kid's film about insects is 'A Bug's Life' (which is also a fantastic movie). The anti-communistic motives and themes of individuality are well presented, and the voice acting is superb (Allen as the puny Z presents a perfectly whiny voice, that fits his character to a tee.) The menacing General Mandibly and his henchman, Cutter, are perfectly crafted by their respective voice actors. The overall plot is also terrific, and for what was to be a children's film, the termite v. ant battle is spectacularly done- very exciting. The overall idea of a lowly worker becoming a leader of his people has been done many times, and 'Antz' sticks with a tried and true notion. If you can see the true ideas behind the cutesy insect animation, you wont be disappointed with 'Antz.'",8,0,1,24 September 2005
