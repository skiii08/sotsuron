The Blair Witch Project," Masterpiece in found footage movies
","This movie is a low budget classic and is going to be an ideal model for future found footage movies. Camera work and Acting is realistic. This movie is a slow burn without much scary elements or jump scares. It is not for everyone, but still it does a good job in conveying the deep horror of being lost in the woods and being terrorized by demonic entities. This movie laid a foundation for future found footage movies and is definitely worth a watch.",7,0,0,14 September 2017
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Mockumentary + black comedy
","This movie took black comedy to its next level. It has lots of s*** jokes but even if it is too uncultured, it is still too funny. I couldn't stop laughing at most of the scenes. In some scenes i laughed so hard that water started coming out of my eyes. The story plot is simple, a man from Kazakhstan comes to USA to understand the American culture and take some valuable lessons back. Sacha Baron Cohen is a genius in doing such roles and no one could have done better. This is without a doubt one of the most funniest movies i have ever watched. If you love s*** jokes and are not offended easily, then this is a must watch movie for you.",9,2,4,14 September 2017
