Alien 3," Alien meets its maker
","In the continuing saga of the Alien series ALIEN 3 gives the saga a heart, a spirit, and a reason for doubt. A troubled production and many script re-writes gave final director David Fincher a rather difficult task. How do you follow a progression that requires either an alien apocalypse or a radical re-definment of a repulsive villain which has become a de-facto hero?H.R. Geigers alien is an enduring work of art. Long after these movies have been forgotten the 'alien' will remain. Fincher decided here to give some spiritual dimension to this phenomenon of cinema. We have the 'new life' sermon at the furnace, the first scene in the 3 movies where we see Ripley relate to another human being as something more than xenomorph fodder. We see the poor inmates, playing scenes as if the alien were some sort of divine retribution for their sins. And doing it in a morbidly realistic way.Most Alien Fans hate A3 because it is a stark, dark movie. The human characters have dimension, awareness and believability. Nobody wins. The Alien least of all. The main protagonist dies, and so does the supporting cast. The only people to emerge from the slaughter and befuddled war, are overly-equipped Japanese mercenaries and of course, the head of the 'company'. This message - no salvation - no victory - is of course anathema to those who cheered on the 'grunts' of aliens. And it is because of this that audiences and critics gave this movie the thumbs down when it came out.In the Alien Pantheon, it is the odd one out. In the David Fincher pantheon it is the touchstone. Alien 3 with it's new take on alien DNA (a dog birth makes it look slightly like a dog) gives the series a credible extension, mired in tragedy.Don't see it on your own. You won't be frightened - you'll be depressed.So... do you trust me with a needle?",Null,3,6,1 September 2004
Akira," Ninth wonder of the wrold
","Akira was THE FIRST Japanese animated movie (and to date one of only 3) to be made for and reach, the art-house movie theaters of Europe and America. At a consistent 26 frames per second, with no cheating (panning and zooming on static artwork) it's still the only one to do so. Akira, like most 'anime' of the time had a storyline borrowed in part from the Novel: 'Neuromancer' and from the Japanese experience with American nuclear 'weapons'. Most Anime features (such as 'Laputa - Island in the sky') have some reference to annihilation by thermonuclear holocaust. In Akira, the agency of Neo-Tokyo's second destruction ( the first being WW3) is 11 year old AKIRA, a boy with magical powers. Years later, in the ruins of the Megacity (mainly culled from 2000AD's Judge Dredd series) known as Neo-Tokyo, young Tetsuo Shima finds himself the focal point of a re-activation of a nebulous, nefarious scheme involving PSI-abilities.AKIRA was originally as an 8 book series. The movie explains -SOME- plot points of books one through four. And does a good job to boot. But no 2 hour(plus) movie could encapsulate the whole story. And it is a story - not a saga. Events in both Akira the movie and Akira the book, move at an extreme pace. Multiple characters have simultaneous events that affect the storyline along a fractured, dangerous fault-line. What impresses most about this movie is not, the violence - which directors like Paul Verhoeven have mirrored in the mainstream, nor the breathtaking action. What made myself and my friends pay attention to this piece of celluloid, was the ability of this filmcrew to let a story develop, beyond the bounds of belief, and revel in it. We had not seen this before. Seldom have we seen it since.To answer the question: why is it the ninth wonder of the world?Akira was one of the last animated movies to be scripted, drawn and coloured by hand.Now look at your hand.",Null,0,2,1 September 2004
The Day After Tomorrow," A prize from a cold, dead hand.
","These days the B-movie has become the most lavishly funded of all of Hollywood's offerings, and it's easy to see why. Young boys grow into Old Boys - who have networks, apparently, and boys, young and old, love thrills 'n spills. Ray Harryhausen's effects were not meant to be funny, comic or warm-hearted. They were devices used to chill the bones of the audience. They thrilled and spilled, (both) and of course today's B-movies do the same. The Day after Tomorrow, doesn't try to equal The Seven Voyages of Sinbad in these stakes; it's your average 21st century B-movie. And it's a good B-movie. More disastrous than Godzilla, funnier than Alien, and colder than Volcano. One reviewer commented that it's most hysterically funny moment is when our heroes literally 'run from the cold'. I agree. Choice B- movie cinema is made from such moments. Giant ape climbs the Empire State building. Martians survive nuclear bombardment to be destroyed by bacteria. Big shark eats people in the Kennedys holiday resort - none of this is will ever happen. The moral of the story is: we really wish it would. Dude that would be so cool!. Nobody likes the status quo. Disaster - on a global scale, frees you from the necessity to brush your teeth - or get up early. In The Day After Tomorrow, the disaster is not over - like love in a Carpenters song, it has only just begun. That's what I like. America ends up living in Mexico, all national debt for South America removed, until (it seems by implication) the attack helicopters get there. And yet it's just so vacuous that you could never, ever, in your wildest dreams, take this movie seriously, in a political sense. You couldn't, could you?",Null,0,1,17 October 2004
